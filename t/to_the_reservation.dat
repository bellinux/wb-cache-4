5|$|If Delsin has evil Karma, {{he kills}} Augustine and, {{together}} with Fetch and Eugene, takes control of Seattle. He releases {{all of the}} imprisoned Conduits and absorbs their powers. Upon returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation,</b> Delsin is met by a wheelchair-bound Betty who banishes him from the tribe for the killings in Seattle. Shocked and angered, Delsin destroys the entire reservation.|$|E
5|$|If Delsin {{has good}} Karma, he spares Augustine and exposes her crimes to the world. She is arrested and the D.U.P. disbands. Delsin, Fetch and Eugene {{convince}} the humans {{that they can}} peacefully coexist with the Conduits. All of the imprisoned Conduits are freed. Delsin returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> and heals the tribe members, then paints a mural dedicated to Reggie.|$|E
5|$|In {{the desert}} near a Navajo Indian {{reservation}} in Two Grey Hills, New Mexico, {{a teenage boy}} comes across a boxcar buried in the ground. He retrieves the corpse of an alien-like figure from the boxcar, which he takes back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> and presents it to the residents, including Navajo elder Albert Hosteen.|$|E
500|$|After being {{relocated}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Camp Verde <b>Reservation,</b> on <b>the</b> Verde River near Camp Verde, the Yavapai there {{began to}} construct irrigation systems (including a five-mile (8km) long ditch) that functioned {{well enough to}} reap sufficient harvests, making the tribe relatively self-sufficient. But contractors that worked with <b>the</b> government <b>to</b> supply <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> were disappointed, and petitioned <b>to</b> have <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> revoked. <b>The</b> government complied, and in March 1875, the government closed <b>the</b> <b>reservation,</b> and marched <b>the</b> residents [...] <b>to</b> <b>the</b> San Carlos <b>reservation.</b> More than 100 Yavapai died during the winter trek.|$|R
50|$|Arnold Short Bull (Lakota: Tȟatȟáŋka Ptéčela) (c. 1845-1923), {{a member}} of the Sičháŋǧu (Brulé) Lakota tribe of Native Americans, {{instrumental}} in bringing the Ghost Dance movement <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations.</b>|$|R

5|$|In June 2010, Jack Thorpe filed {{a federal}} {{lawsuit against the}} borough of Jim Thorpe, seeking to have his father's remains {{returned}} to his homeland and re-interred near other family members in Oklahoma. Citing the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, Jack was arguing to bring his father's remains <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> in Oklahoma, {{where they would be}} buried near those of his father, sisters and brother, a mile from the place he was born. He claimed that the agreement between his stepmother and Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, borough officials was made against the wishes of other family members who want him buried in Native American land. Jack Thorpe died at 73 on February 22, 2011.|$|E
25|$|Afterward, as the {{remaining}} Kiowa went <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation,</b> the younger Dohäsan {{lived with his}} family in peace on the reservation near Fort Sill until his death.|$|E
25|$|After moving <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation,</b> Quanah got {{in touch}} with his white {{relatives}} from his mother's family. He stayed for a few weeks with them, where he studied English and Western culture, and learned white farming techniques.|$|E
2500|$|But some Potawatomi evaded these removals, {{and others}} moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> but were unsatisfied, and came back. These off-reservation Indians were called [...] "stray bands" [...] or [...] "strolling Potawatomi", living in less-settled areas {{and moving on}} when {{pressure}} from settlers became uncomfortable.|$|R
25|$|Beginning in the 1940s, however, more Seminoles began <b>to</b> move <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations.</b> A major {{catalyst}} {{for this was}} the conversion of many Seminole to Christianity, following missionary effort spearheaded by the Creek Baptist evangelist Stanley Smith. For the new converts, relocating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> afforded them <b>the</b> opportunity <b>to</b> establish their own churches, where they adapted traditions to incorporate into their style of Christianity. Reservation Seminoles began forming tribal governments and forming ties with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1957 the nation reorganized and established formal relations with the US government as the Seminole Tribe of Florida. The Seminole Tribe of Florida is headquartered in Hollywood, Florida. They control several reservations: Big Cypress, Brighton Reservation, Fort Pierce Reservation, Hollywood Reservation, Immokalee Reservation, and Tampa Reservation.|$|R
50|$|The church's {{history can}} be traced back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> year 1833 {{at the close of the}} Blackhawk War, when the treaty with the Native Americans removed most of <b>the</b> Native Americans <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> west of <b>the</b> Mississippi and opened the {{northern}} prairies of Illinois for settlement.|$|R
25|$|In 1999, the Supreme Court of the United States {{ruled that}} only the Potawatomi had {{proprietary}} rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> land ceded on 1890, so the Absentee-Shawnee were unable {{to share in the}} 1968 award for under payment.|$|E
25|$|Each camp {{is usually}} {{run by a}} camp director, {{assistant}} camp director, and two program commissioners (three for Camp Sandy Beach), all of which answer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Reservation</b> Director (currently Thomas J. Sisson). As there are three distinct camps, {{each has its own}} songs, cheers, history, and traditions. With the exception of each camp's waterfront and dining lodge, all program centers are available to campers from all three camps.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1979 the Mississippi Choctaw tribal council {{worked on}} a variety of {{economic}} development initiatives, first geared toward attracting industry <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b> They had many people available to work, natural resources, and no state or federal taxes. Industries have included automotive parts, greeting cards, direct mail and printing, and plastic-molding. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians is one of the state's largest employers, running 19 businesses and employing 7,800 people.|$|E
50|$|After {{killing a}} bill he {{sponsored}} {{to extend a}} combined high school-community college program to school districts on the Ute Mountain and Southern Ute Indian <b>Reservation,</b> at <b>the</b> request of tribal leaders, Casso is expected <b>to</b> travel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> <b>to</b> discuss <b>the</b> program following the legislative session.|$|R
25|$|In the 20th {{century before}} World War II, the Seminole in Florida {{divided into two}} groups; those who were more {{traditional}} and those willing <b>to</b> adapt <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations.</b> Those who accepted reservation lands and made adaptations achieved federal recognition in 1957 as the Seminole Tribe of Florida.|$|R
50|$|At present, Little Tom Mountain is {{not open}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> public. <b>Reservation</b> access {{is limited to}} special {{programs}} and volunteer workdays until <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> formally opens in 2013.|$|R
25|$|Another {{important}} factor would include Quanah Parker, a Kwahada leader, who rode {{into the situation}} with an Army pass, {{to seek out the}} raiding Indians and to convince them to return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b> Parker and the primary buffalo hunter scout Jose Piedad Tafoya, a half breed Comanchero, would come to an understanding despite previous difficulties between the two. Tafoya would help confound the search by the buffalo hunters and the soldiers led by Nolan in return for what he wanted.|$|E
25|$|Gerald Clarke {{was born}} in Hemet, California in 1967 to Carol and Gerald Clarke, Sr., his father being born Cahuilla. At the age of 3 his parents {{divorced}} and he moved with his siblings and mother to Orange County, and on the weekends he would return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> {{to spend time with}} his father. At age 16, he moved to Arkansas with his mother and sister. He attended Ozarka College, where he majored in welding, electrical maintenance, and hydraulics; three necessary components to the artworks Clarke would create as a full-time artist.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the buffalo}} hunters would proceed {{to the site of}} present-day Lubbock, Texas. This is where they found much of their stolen stock. They learned that the Comanche Indians were {{returning}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> with Parker. Tafayo had already claimed his stock and a few others. The hunters later declared this was the last Comanche raid in Texas. The first of them would send out word about Nolan's lost command with the speculation that the Comanche had wiped out Nolan's command. The story was sent east by telegraph where it made headline news.|$|E
50|$|However, the Press Council {{never came}} into {{operation}} due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations</b> of <b>the</b> media organisations. In protest over its establishment, the professional journalists organisations refrained from nominating their four members <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Council. Nevertheless, the chairman was appointed, offices now exist and general administration work continues. This has led <b>the</b> government <b>to</b> review <b>the</b> entire Press Council mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Following the war, many Cayuga {{relocated}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Seneca <b>reservation</b> at Tonawanda.|$|R
50|$|Conscious Alliance strives <b>to</b> {{alleviate}} <b>the</b> immediate {{need for}} the basic necessities of life, while simultaneously teaming up with community leaders to create possibilities for the future. As the organization provides food <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservations,</b> it is working with these leaders to inspire members of the community, with particular focus on positive youth outreach programs <b>to</b> empower <b>the</b> next generation.|$|R
25|$|Economic {{support for}} the tribe comes {{from a variety of}} sources. Some of the Tohono O’odham still farm or engage in {{subsistence}} ranching. The tribe sells and leases copper mineral rights to support itself. Gambling from the three casinos that the tribe operates has become the major source of {{support for the}} tribe in terms of revenue and jobs creation. The tribe operates the Tohono O'odham Utility Authority a tribal firm established in 1970 to provide electric and water service <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b> Basket weaving remains an economic pursuit; the tribe produces more basketry than any other tribe in the United States.|$|E
25|$|The main {{difference}} between the Brazilian and Guyanese Wapishana is their rights to land. In Guyana, Amerindian villages are state elected administrative units {{but there is nothing}} relating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> system and villages are in remote areas. Although the situation of Guyanese Wapishana is better than most part of the Brazilian population of Wapishana, it is still far from perfect. Entirely, Amerindians are the least privileged group of Guyanese society. Among their problems are health and education, unfortunately the Rupununi region is one of those Amerindian populations that are particularly suffering from these problems, according to a study demonstrated by the ARU.|$|E
25|$|Sheridan {{replaced}} Crook with General Nelson A. Miles. In 1886, General Miles selected Captain Henry Lawton {{to command}} B Troop, 4th Cavalry, at Fort Huachuca, and First Lieutenant Charles B. Gatewood, {{to lead the}} expedition that brought Geronimo and his followers back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> system for a final time. Lawton was given orders to head up actions south of the U.S.–Mexico boundary, where {{it was thought that}} Geronimo and a small band of his followers would take refuge from U.S. authorities. Lawton was to pursue, subdue, and return Geronimo to the U.S., dead or alive.|$|E
25|$|In May 1863, Dakota {{survivors}} {{were forced}} aboard steamboats and relocated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Crow Creek <b>Reservation,</b> in <b>the</b> southeastern Dakota Territory, a place stricken by drought at the time. Many {{of the survivors}} of Crow Creek moved three years later <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Niobrara <b>Reservation</b> in Nebraska.|$|R

30|$|Selection of <b>the</b> active flow <b>to</b> {{transmit}} {{based on}} <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> made: <b>the</b> node will share its transmission time proportionally <b>to</b> <b>the</b> resource <b>reservation</b> made.

25|$|An {{agreement}} was reached on July 7, 1883 {{for the government to}} purchase the entire Columbia Reservation from the Indians. Those families formerly assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation</b> were to be given the choice of moving to the Colville Reservation or taking allotments of one section (1 sq mi or 2.6km²) of land each. By act of Congress on July 4, 1884, the entire reservation was restored to the public domain. On May 1, 1886 it was formally reopened for white settlement. The influx of settlers was so great that Okanogan County (roughly the same area as the Columbia Reservation) was split from Stevens County two years later.|$|E
25|$|At a 2002 {{special meeting}} of the IWC, which some members did not attend, Iceland's request and {{reservation}} were once again brought before the commission. However, Iceland modified its reservation to specify a time-limit prior to the resumption of any commercial whaling under objection to the moratorium. In the votes that followed, the Commission first voted 18–18 to uphold the same process from previous meetings. The next vote upheld the Chairman's ruling that Iceland {{should be allowed to}} vote, 18–18 once again. Finally, the vote to uphold previous decisions to deny Iceland's reservation was defeated with 18 in favor and 19 opposed. Iceland was the deciding vote in its own favor as it rejoined the IWC. Half of the attending nations formally objected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Parker's home in Cache, Oklahoma {{was called}} the Star House. Parker's was the last tribe of the Staked Plains or Llano Estacado to come <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reservation.</b> Quanah was named chief over all the Comanches on the reservation, and {{proved to be a}} forceful, {{resourceful}} and able leader. Through wise investments, he became perhaps the wealthiest American Indian of his day in the United States. At this time, Quanah embraced much of white culture and adopted the surname Parker. He was well respected by the whites. He went on hunting trips with President Theodore Roosevelt, who often visited him. Nevertheless, he rejected both monogamy and traditional Protestant Christianity in favor of the Native American Church Movement, of which he was a founder.|$|E

50|$|The Governor sent Adjutant General of California, William C. Kibbe <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} {{counties of}} California to organize volunteer military companies to stop Indian raids, collect them and remove them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mendocino Indian <b>Reservation.</b> At Red Bluff, General Kibbe raised {{a company of}} 93 California militia, the Kibbe Rangers, under Captain William Byrnes. General Kibbe directed Captain Byrnes to carry out an expedition against the Indians in Tehama, Shasta, Plumas, and Butte counties. In the following three months, Captain Byrnes' rangers had many minor clashes with bands of Indians and captured more than 500. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> snow blocking the route over <b>the</b> coastal ranges <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mendocino <b>Reservation,</b> <b>the</b> captive Indians were taken by steamboat from Red Bluff <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tejon <b>Reservation.</b>|$|R
