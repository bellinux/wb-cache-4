40|$|In his book, Whales and Nations: Environmental Diplomacy on the High Seas, Kurkpatrick Dorsey {{does what}} all good historians must do: he stays {{focused on the}} context. Despite the {{potential}} sentimentalism Dorsey could have written into his history of whaling diplomacy, he avoids the trap of <b>trade-book</b> genres and remains throughout a very good evenhanded historian. By doing so Dorsey advances {{our understanding of how}} politics, science, and culture shaped resource conservation in the twentieth century. His history illustrates the complexity of resource conservation when so many different voices, national and cultural, compete to interpret a species and its environment...|$|E

It traces the function of ‘literary fiction’ as industry category and locus of symbolic value and national cultural capital, mapping its structures and dynamics in Australia, including the impact of digital technologies.

These terms and other synonyms have assumed in some quarters the emotive equivalent of the terms 2 ̆ 2 traitor, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 incompetent, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 sadist. 2 ̆ 2 Recent leaders in education have generated numerous alternatives to the traditional teaching patterns suggested by the supposedly odious terms. These alternatives have included: inquiry, discovery, interest centers, <b>trade-book</b> reading programs, and such organizational arrangements as open-concept rooms and so-called 2 ̆ 2 free 2 ̆ 2 schools. Work by Jerome S. Bruner (1966) for instance, has caused us to shift our concern from the memorization of facts to the discovery of principles. This emerging approach to education has had its inevitable effects upon the teaching of reading...|$|E
