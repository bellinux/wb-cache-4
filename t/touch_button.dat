30|$|Apart from muscle {{activity}} in the thumb, another significant finding was that a small <b>touch</b> <b>button</b> has {{a greater impact on}} thumb performance in the elderly. Compared with a larger button, a smaller button is physically harder to locate. Thus, to maintain an acceptable accuracy of target selection, the elderly participants made more effort to retain a vertical thumb posture. In this case, performing a precision grip for performing the touchscreen operating tasks became a challenge for the elderly subjects with their decreased general hand functions (Carmeli et al. 2003; Ranganathan et al. 2001). Since general hand function is significantly decreased with age, the tapping pace could not be maintained by elderly users (Ranganathan et al. 2001). For this reason, elderly people are less likely than young users to retain a vertical thumb posture that could ensure tapping precision, despite making greater effort to do so. Therefore, smaller buttons were more difficult than larger buttons for the elderly to operate, the tapping speed was reduced, and fatigue appeared earlier as a result.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Information leakage {{of general}} input {{operations}} using button images in {{graphical user interface}} on touch screen monitors was experimentally investigated from images reconstructed by receiving the electromagnetic noise. In the experimental investigations for input operations of a personal identification number, {{it was confirmed that}} when a <b>button</b> image was <b>touched,</b> the <b>touched</b> <b>button</b> image can be identified from the reconstructed button images. This kind of information leakage has originated the fact that the <b>touched</b> <b>button</b> image has changed the color for informing the operator which <b>button</b> image was <b>touched.</b> From the elucidation of the image reconstruction mechanism, {{it was found that the}} information leakage has been caused by the magnitude of the emitted signal that results from the analog voltage differences of the RGB signals between neighboring pixels on the monitor. Therefore, a countermeasure method was proposed from the viewpoint of the combination of the colors of the button images and of the background or of the numerals in the button images. The countermeasure method was then applied to the previous input operations of a personal identification number. From the experimental results for the countermeasure method, it was confirmed that the <b>touched</b> <b>button</b> image cannot be identified from the reconstructed button image. As a result, the proposal countermeasure method can prevent effectively the information leakage of input operations on touch screen monitors due to the electromagnetic noise...|$|R

The TVWS operates in the 8 - 12 µm infrared (IR) and 300 - 900 nm visible wavebands for enhanced vision capabilities in day and night operations. It is equipped with lightweight athermalized coaxial catadioptric objectives, a bolometric IR imager operating in a microscan mode providing an effective resolution of 320 x 240 pixels and a visible image intensifier of 768 x 493 pixels. The TVWS {{is equipped with a}} miniature shutter for automatic offset calibration. Real-time imaging at 30 fps is available. Both the visible and IR images can be toggled with a single <b>touch</b> <b>button</b> and displayed on an integrated color micro liquid crystal display (LCD).

30|$|When using a {{touchscreen}} smartphone, elderly {{users are}} likely to benefit from some special interface features. For instance, {{in order to enhance}} the ability to recognise touch targets, many elderly users may prefer to set the fonts and icons to a larger size. However, this could increase the time that they require to flip through the menus, and their thumbs (when operating with one hand) have to pass over a larger area to reach the larger targets. By doing this, the likelihood of making input errors and dropping the phone may increase, consequently increasing the physical and mental effort required to use the touchscreen smartphone. Moreover, from a kinematical perspective, the difficulties for elderly users in operating a touchscreen smartphone seem severe. A study found that small <b>touch</b> <b>button</b> size, poor spacing among the touch buttons and inconvenient location of targets on touchscreen smartphones significantly reduced the finger pointing performance in elderly users (Hwangbo et al. 2013). In addition, Cole and Rotella (2002) reported that aging is a significant factor that impairs visual cues for predictive control of finger force when gripping a mobile phone in hand. Olafsdottir et al. (2007) also pointed out that decreased performance in accurate multi-finger movements normally accompanies old age. Moreover, it was found that aging has a degenerative effect on hand functions, especially in precision grip, pinch force and maintaining a steady pinch posture (Carmeli et al. 2003; Ranganathan et al. 2001). Muraki et al. (2010) revealed that the elderly tended to have more pushing errors on small cell phones than young participants. Another study also showed that middle-aged subjects (40 – 65  years) exhibited significantly slower input speed than the young (20 – 32  years) when using a touchpad device (Armbruster et al. 2007). More significantly, Xiong and Muraki (2014) found that tapping small touch buttons on a smartphone touchscreen tends to increase the muscle effort of the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) in young participants, which was regarded as the main reason for reduced input thumb performance on a touchscreen.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBecause {{of their}} compact design modern mobile devices {{facilitate}} ubiquitous interaction {{in a broad}} application area. Text input on the limited space of a mobile device often leads to small sizes of interaction buttons. Therefore, the commonly used keys of a soft-keyboard become very small. Hitting these keys correctly requires high-precision movements and incorrect operations are frequent. Furthermore, interaction with mobile devices often involves additional activities of the user. This context requires a specially adapted interface. It includes <b>touch</b> <b>button</b> sizes, which should be adapted or at least be adaptable to the walking condition. The goal {{of this study was}} to investigate in the optimal size of the sensitive areas of touch buttons for mobile devices. A literature research revealed that button sizes as well as interaction while walking has been addressed before, but until now the influence of walking on interaction accuracy has not been studied. Therefore, we run a study to cover this issue. Thereby, for time on task, we found highly significant differences between small button (5 * 5 mm) and all the other button sizes (p < 0. 01). Walking had a highly significant influence for the button sizes 5 * 5 mm and 8 * 8 mm (p < 0. 01). Error count showed an influence of button size (5 * 5 mm) compared to the other sizes (p < 0. 01). Additionally, it showed a highly significant influence of walking (p < 0. 01). Walking triggered a very high number of errors, especially in smaller buttons. But even in bigger buttons the error count increased significantly (p= 0. 041). A button size of 8 * 8 mm is applicable while standing, but still triggers a high number of errors. Only using button sizes of 14 * 14 mm showed low errors rates while walking as well as while standing. Therefore, we recommend this button size especially for designs, which are to be used while walking...|$|E
30|$|In addition, the FDI is {{a muscle}} {{providing}} distally and ulnarly directed {{force for the}} first metacarpal bone in the thumb (Brand and Hollister 1993). Thus, the elderly may increase the effort in this muscle to maintain the direction and stability of the thumb in the tapping of <b>touch</b> <b>buttons.</b> Another {{study found that the}} muscle activity of FDI increased with increasing neural activity of ulnar neuropathy in the wrist (Kim 2011). Their study further proposed that smaller buttons not only increase muscle disorders in the thumb by over-contraction, but also may increase the possibility of developing neural disorders in the operating hand and forearm. To sum up, owing to the increased effort demands on FDI, the thumb performance of elderly users upon tapping smaller <b>touch</b> <b>buttons</b> on a smartphone touchscreen decreased, while increasing the risk of physiological disorders in the operating thumb and hand.|$|R
