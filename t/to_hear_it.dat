5|$|It is a {{collaboration}} {{with one of}} my friends from the international music industry, Eric Turner, a very talented guy from Sweden, and with the boys from Play & Win. It is very particular. I consider that I went through all stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, which makes me move in a club and makes me want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E
5|$|On March 16, 1824 Mr. Lowndes, the BFBS's {{secretary}} in Corfu, {{sent a letter}} to the society in which he mentioned that the sum paid to Meksi for his work was 6,000 piastras and that Archimandrite Grigor was paid 60 crowns. On September 5, 1824 the Saint Matthew's Gospel was published in Albanian. According to Lowndes' letters, the Albanian community of Missolonghi was extremely excited when mass was said with a piece from Saint Matthew, as since its translation they had been impatient <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> in Albanian. In July 1827 the form in which the first 500copies of the New Testament were to be bound was decided in London. The entire edition amounted to 2,000copies.|$|E
25|$|Mrs. Adams {{reads it}} with great delight, and reads {{to me what}} she finds interesting, and that is, indeed, the whole book. I have not time <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> all.|$|E

25|$|Because Marbury filed his {{petition}} for the writ of mandamus {{directly in the}} Supreme Court, the Court needed {{to be able to}} exercise original jurisdiction over the case in order to have the power <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both the {{district}} court in Los Angeles and the Ninth Circuit relied on Federal Baseball Club in ruling for the defendants.

6000|$|... "Well, I'm sure, sir," [...] said Mrs Bland, condescending to be interested, and to ignore, {{if not to}} forget, the coffee, [...] "I'm {{very glad}} <b>to</b> <b>'ear</b> <b>it,</b> sir, for Captain Stride is a {{pleasant}} cheery sort of man, and would be agreeable company if 'e didn't use so much sea-langwidge, and speak so much of 'is missis.

25|$|Bridge {{also wrote}} and edited many carols, and was {{editor of the}} Westminster Abbey Hymn-Book and the Wesleyan Hymn-Book. Among his shorter works are many songs, both comic and serious. The former were popular, and Bridge commented that he had written {{a good deal of}} serious music, but that nobody seemed to want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although Singh {{had been}} baptised by an Anglican priest, he was {{ignorant of the}} ecclesiastical culture and {{conventions}} of Anglicanism. His inability to adapt hindered him from fitting in with the routines of academic study. Much in the college course seemed irrelevant to the gospel as India needed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b> After eight months in the college, Singh left in July 1910.|$|E
25|$|The 1980 Night Grand Final between North Melbourne and Collingwood at VFL Park {{ended in}} similar circumstances: the siren sounded, but the umpires were unable <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b> In the ensuing play, North Melbourne's Kerry Good marked and goaled after the siren {{to win the}} game for North Melbourne by three points. Collingwood did not appeal, and the result stands as official.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} Sergeant, {{gathering}} up the tea-things, [...] "knowin' what I know o' the young dev--gentlemen of the College, I'm very glad <b>to</b> <b>'ear</b> <b>it.</b> But what am I {{to tell the}} 'Ead?" ...|$|R

25|$|Wes Humboldt (Mike O'Brien) {{owns and}} {{operates}} the liquor and insurance store in town. His father died saving his entire platoon in the Korean War, although everyone {{told him that he}} ran off to join the circus. Wes later learns the truth when Brent reads out a passage from a book detailing the history of Dog River, not knowing that Wes was not supposed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|The case took a {{long time}} to come before the court, which twice {{declined}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b> When it finally did, the justices suggested they would clarify once and for all the extent to which opinions could be expressed without fear of being held libellous. The actual decision, however, was regarded as having confused the issue somewhat instead. Several state courts have responded by recognizing an opinion privilege in some way in their own jurisprudence.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} playing equipment, the major {{adaptation}} is the ball, which is significantly {{larger than a}} standard cricket ball and filled with ball bearings. The size allows partially sighted players to see the ball and the contents allow blind players <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b> The wicket (stumps) is also larger, to allow partially sighted players to see and blind players to touch {{it in order to}} correctly orient themselves when batting or bowling.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2011 {{interview}} with Bendigo Weekly, Geyer said [...] "People like it (the album) because it's {{the songs that}} I know are the most yelled out for me. I know {{these are the ones}} that people really want <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> <b>It's</b> a basic sum-up of my career." ...|$|R

25|$|Commercial Radio {{had been}} {{expanding}} rapidly throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, {{starting with the}} launch of LBC in London, a news based service. Commercial Radio came to parts of Cornwall, mainly the south east of the county (approximately within thirty miles of Plymouth) with the launch of Plymouth Sound in 1975. This gave those listeners fortunate <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it,</b> pop music in stereo on FM for the first time. The two main FM transmitters for Cornwall, namely North Hessary Tor, which opened in 1956, and Four Lanes/Redruth, (which opened in 1964), although transmitting BBC Radio 2, were not yet stereo capable.|$|E
25|$|In the State of Hawaii, {{specifically}} on the Island of Hawaii (Hawaii County), state representative Faye Hanohano, a Native Hawaiian rights activist, pressed for a measure to delist C. mydas from protected status so that Native Hawaiians could legally harvest the turtles and possibly their eggs as well. The bill, HCR14, was largely overlooked by the media since at that point {{it was only a}} local issue. While the bill was passed in the House, the Senate's Committee on Energy and Environment refused <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it,</b> which meant that the bill did not go on to be heard by the Senate.|$|E
25|$|Smith figured {{prominently}} {{in the establishment of}} the Mormon doctrine of the redemption of the dead and the later establishment of the practice of baptism for the dead. On January 21, 1836, after the completion of the Kirtland Temple, Joseph Smith claimed to have had a vision of the celestial kingdom. Smith stated that he saw his brother Alvin in this vision, and was surprised at his presence since he had died before the establishment of the church and its associated doctrines. Joseph Smith stated that he then received a revelation concerning the salvation of those who die without hearing the gospel and their ability to receive the same opportunities as those who had the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> on earth.|$|E

25|$|According to {{classical}} rabbinical literature, {{in order for}} the Urim and Thummim to give an answer, it was first necessary for the individual to stand facing the fully dressed high priest, and vocalise the question briefly and in a simple way, though it was not necessary for it to be loud enough for anyone else <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b> The Talmudic rabbis argued that Urim and Thummim were words written on the sacred breastplate. Most of the Talmudic rabbis, and Josephus, following the belief that Urim meant lights, argued that divination by Urim and Thummim involved questions being answered by great rays of light shining out of certain jewels on the breastplate; each jewel was taken to represent different letters, and the sequence of lighting thus would spell out an answer (though there were 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet, and only 12 jewels on the breastplate); two Talmudic rabbis, however, argued that the jewels themselves moved {{in a way that made}} them stand out from the rest, or even moved themselves into groups to form words.|$|E
25|$|Suppose a {{listener}} cannot hear a given acoustical signal under silent condition. When a signal is playing while another sound {{is being played}} (a masker) the signal has to be stronger for the listener <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b> The masker {{does not need to}} have the frequency components of the original signal for masking to happen. A masked signal can be heard even though it is weaker than the masker. Masking happens when a signal and a masker are played together. It also happens when a masker starts after a signal stops playing. The effects of backward masking is weaker than forward masking. The masking effect has been widely used in psychoacoustical research. With masking you can change the levels of the masker and measure the threshold, then create a diagram of a psychophysical tuning curve that will reveal similar features. Masking effects are also used for audio encoding. The masking effect is used in lossy encoders. It can eliminate some of the weaker sounds, so the listener can not hear the difference. This technique has been used in MP3's.|$|E
500|$|In the Confederate States of America, God Save the South was the {{official}} national anthem. [...] However, Dixie {{was the most}} popular. [...] United States President Abraham Lincoln said he loved Dixie and wanted <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> played, saying [...] "as we had captured the rebel army, we had also captured the rebel tune". [...] At an April 9, 1865, rally, the band director was surprised when Lincoln requested that the band play Dixie. [...] Lincoln said, [...] "That tune is now Federal property...good to show the rebels that, with us in power, they will be free <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> again". The other prominent tune was The Bonnie Blue Flag, and like Dixie was written in 1861, unlike Union popular tunes which were written throughout the war.|$|E

6000|$|It was an oddity of Mrs. Lowder's {{that her}} face in speech was like a lighted window at night, but that silence {{immediately}} drew the curtain. The occasion for reply allowed by her silence was never easy to take; yet she was still less easy to interrupt. The great glaze of her surface, at all events, gave her visitor no present help.
