Hadn't thought about this thing for years. Of course, it's all shot to ribbons, this thing. It's got jagged steel sticking out at all ends and angles, and it's a big submarine! It's a— I don't know, {{about the size of the}} first Narwhal that we built. And the fishermen coming in there and fishing are dragging their nets around in that area, and it's just tearing their nets to ribbons— they've even hired a civilian contractor to try to blow the thing up and get it the devil out of there— and has evidently been raising bob with postwar fishing here for more years than I'd care to count.|$|E

The idea for [...] "Sailor Mouth" [...] was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon's experience [...] " [...] I got in trouble for saying the f-word in front of my mother." [...] Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life." [...] The end of the episode, where Mr. Krabs uses more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was also inspired [...] "by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself." ...|$|E

It begins [...] "In view of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> articles and statements on Scientology may have influenced young people to associate themselves with the so called Church of Scientology, I feel an obligation to make my present views on the subject quite clear." [...] Burroughs states that some Scientology practices have value: [...] "Some of the techniques are highly valuable and warrant further study and experimentation." [...] He is critical of the Church of Scientology's organizational policy and organizations in general, and Scientology's attempts to keep many of its counseling methods secret, and writes [...] "On the other hand I am in flat disagreement with the organizational policy." ...|$|E

500|$|The writing staff {{often used}} their {{individual}} life experiences for inspirations {{to come up}} with the storylines of the series' episodes. For example, the episode [...] "Sailor Mouth", in which SpongeBob and Patrick learn profanity, was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon's experience of getting in trouble as a child for using the f-word in front of his mother. Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life". The end of the episode, in which Mr. Krabs uses even more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was inspired [...] "by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself". The idea for the episode [...] "The Secret Box" [...] also came from one of Drymon's childhood experiences. Hillenburg explained, [...] "Drymon had a secret box [...] and started telling us about it. We wanted to make fun of him and use it." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 2013 Mendes said {{he would}} not return to direct the next film in the series, then known as Bond 24; he later recanted and {{announced}} that he would return, as he found the script and the plans for the long-term future of the franchise appealing. Nicolas Winding Refn would later reveal that he turned down an offer to direct the movie. In directing Skyfall and Spectre, Mendes became the first director to oversee two consecutive Bond films since John Glen directed The Living Daylights and Licence to Kill in 1987 and 1989. Dennis Gassner returned as the film's production designer, while cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema took over from Roger Deakins. In July 2015 Mendes noted that the combined crew of Spectre numbered over one thousand, making it a larger production than Skyfall. Craig is listed as co-producer. He considered the credit a high point of his career, saying [...] "I'm just so proud of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> name comes up somewhere else on the titles." ...|$|E
500|$|Episodes {{were written}} {{by a team of}} writers, which {{consisted}} of Dohrn, David Fain, Greenblatt, Mr. Lawrence, Lender, Mark O'Hare, Povenmire, William Reiss, Springer, Tibbitt, and Merriwether Williams. During the season, the writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for individual episodes. For example, in the episode [...] "Sailor Mouth", SpongeBob learns profanity. The idea for the episode was inspired by creative director Derek Drymon's experience [...] " [...] I got in trouble for saying the f-word in front of my mother." [...] Drymon said, [...] "The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. Krabs to tattle, with SpongeBob chasing him, is pretty much how it happened in real life." [...] The end of the episode, where Mr. Krabs uses more profanity than SpongeBob and Patrick, was also inspired [...] "by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> [...] mother has a sailor mouth herself." [...] In [...] "Secret Box", SpongeBob wants to see what is inside Patrick's secret box. The idea came to Drymon because he too had a secret box as a child.

His wife tried to console him for losing his premiership position.

[...] He is famous for having once said to a man who asked him to join a prolific business project [...] "I would never even dare give the chance to the smallest villager in the most remote town to even think that I made a benefit of one penny".|$|E
2500|$|It later transpired that Kat was {{the mother}} of Zoe, after being raped by her uncle Harry Slater (Michael Elphick). Actress Jessie Wallace was cast in the role of Kat after the {{character}} was developed at an improvisation session for thirty actors and actresses earlier in the year. Speaking of her casting, Wallace commented: [...] "I'm pleased to be playing the champion floosie in the square. I want to achieve Cindy Beale proportions! Basically, Kat goes clubbing, steals other people's men and gets into fights. I love her. Everyone's warned me to expect a lot of stick in the street – Kat's such a full-on character. But I'm prepared for <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> life's going to change completely. I can't wait, {{but at the same time}} I'm scared."

2500|$|A {{promising}} {{and intelligent}} youth, Morgan contracted meningitis in August 1929. The disease {{left him with}} a total loss of hearing. Emily Morgan kept him home from school for an entire year, hoping that some hearing would return. Deafness cut off his ability to relate to people around him. The once popular, social, and athletic boy became socially introverted, devoting much of his time to reading and study. Morgan recalled that he had not yet reconciled himself to his deafness by the time he returned to school. In 1951, in a letter to Marguerite Sinclair Reusser, he wrote that a minor family crisis in March 1931 led to a hysterical outburst. During this emotional time, Morgan finally confided in his mother the difficulties and fears he had faced over the loss of his hearing. [...] "I began to face the future instead of wasting myself in bitter regret over a past that was beyond my reach. That was the beginning of my adjustment to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> hearing was gone and would probably never return." [...] At this time, he began a lifelong pattern of writing, producing thousands of careful transcriptions, personal letters, and books in his field.|$|E

2500|$|The Symphony No. 1 premiered on 28 March 1897 {{in one of}} {{a long-running}} series of Russian Symphony Concerts. The piece was brutally panned by critic and {{nationalist}} composer César Cui, who likened it to a depiction of the ten plagues of Egypt, suggesting it would be admired by the [...] "inmates" [...] of a music conservatory in Hell. The deficiencies of the performance, conducted by Alexander Glazunov, were not commented on by critics, {{but according to a}} memoir from Alexander Ossovsky, a close friend of Rachmaninoff, Glazunov made poor use of rehearsal time, and the concert's program itself, which contained two other premières, was also a factor. Other witnesses suggested that Glazunov, an alcoholic, may have been drunk, although this was never intimated by Rachmaninoff. Following the reaction to his first symphony, Rachmaninoff wrote in May 1897 that [...] "I'm not at all affected" [...] by its lack of success or critical reaction, but felt [...] "deeply distressed and heavily depressed by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> Symphony ... did not please me at all after its first rehearsal." [...] He thought its performance was poor, particularly Glazunov's contribution. The piece was not performed for the rest of Rachmaninoff's life, but he revised it into a four-hand piano arrangement in 1898.|$|E
2500|$|The Alyona Show, {{hosted by}} Alyona Minkovski, ran from 2009 to 2012 (when Minkovski left RT to join The Huffington Post). Daily Beast writer Tracy Quan {{described}} The Alyona Show as [...] "one of RT's most popular vehicles". The New Republic columnist Jesse Zwick wrote that one journalist {{told him that}} Minkovski is [...] "probably the best interviewer on cable news." [...] Benjamin R. Freed wrote in the avant-garde culture magazine SOMA that [...] "The Alyona Show does political talk with razor-sharp wit." [...] David Weigel called the show [...] "an in-house attempt at a newsy cult hit" [...] and noted that [...] "her meatiest segments were about government spying, and the Federal Reserve, and America's undeclared wars". Minkovski had complained about being characterized {{as if she was}} [...] "Putin's girl in Washington" [...] or as being [...] "anti-American". After Minkovski argued that Glenn Beck was [...] "not on the side of America. And <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> channel is more honest with the American people is something you should be ashamed of.", Columbia Journalism Review writer Julia Ioffe asked [...] "since when does Russia Today defend the policies of any American president? Or the informational needs of the American public, for that matter?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Davis and Wyler {{frequently}} fought during filming, {{about everything}} from her appearance (Wyler thought {{she looked like a}} Kabuki performer, but Davis wanted to look older than her age as the part was written for a 40-year-old) to the set design (which Davis thought was far too opulent for a family supposedly struggling financially) to her interpretation of the role (Wyler wanted a more feminine and sympathetic Regina, akin to Tallulah's interpretation). Davis had yielded to Wyler's demands during production of The Letter, but this time she held her ground. Not helping the situation was the fact Los Angeles was experiencing its worst heat wave in years, and the temperature on the soundstages regularly rose above 100 degrees. Davis finally walked off the picture. [...] "It was the only time in my career that I walked out on a film after the shooting had begun," [...] she later recalled. [...] "I was a nervous wreck due to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> favorite and most admired director was fighting me every inch of the way ... I just didn't want to continue." [...] The actress retreated to her rented house in Laguna Beach and [...] "flatly refused to come back to work. It took a little courage, to say the least. Goldwyn had it in his power to sue me for the entire cost of the production." [...] A week later she returned to the set after rumors she would be replaced by Katharine Hepburn or Miriam Hopkins began to circulate, although Goldwyn was not about to bear the expense of scrapping all the footage with Davis and refilming the scenes with a new actress. Even though the film was a critical and commercial success and nominated for nine Academy Awards, she and Wyler never worked together again.|$|E
