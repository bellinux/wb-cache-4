5|$|Montagu {{was created}} Earl of Salisbury on 16 March 1337. This {{was one of}} six comital {{promotions}} Edward III made that day, in preparation for {{what was to become}} the Hundred Years' War. To allow Montagu to support his new status, the king granted him land and rent of a value of 1000 marks a year. The money was provided from the royal stannaries of Cornwall. A contemporary poem tells of a vow made by the earl {{on the eve of the}} warshe would not open one of his eyes while fighting in France. The story is probably a satire; <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Montagu had already lost the use of one of his eyes in a tournament.|$|E
5|$|Dissident {{success was}} mixed. Jews wanting to emigrate from the Soviet Union in the 1970s formed the most successful, and most organised, {{dissident}} movement. Their {{success can be}} attributed to the movement's support abroad, most notably from the Jewish community in the United States. In addition, as a group they were not advocating a transformation of Soviet society; the Jewish dissident movement was simply interested in leaving the Soviet Union for Israel. The Soviet Government subsequently sought to improve diplomatic ties with the First World by allowing the Jews to emigrate. The emigration flow was reduced dramatically as Soviet–American tension increased in the later half of the 1970s, though it was revived somewhat in 1979, peaking at 50,000. In the early 1980s, however, the Soviet leadership decided to block emigration completely. Despite official claims that anti-Semitism was a bourgeois ideology incompatible with socialism, <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Jews who openly practiced their religion or identified as Jewish from a cultural standpoint faced widespread discrimination from the Soviet system.|$|E
25|$|March 15, 1589 was {{the last}} time that don Martino de Levya saw his daughter. Her father said he would leave her the {{inheritance}} of 6.000 lire, to be given to her by Giuseppe Limiato. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Limiato never received the money. Historical witnesses have confirmed she did receive income from the yearly revenues for being a nun.|$|E

25|$|However, things {{quickly turned}} sour. Although {{he watched the}} first few races of the 1995 season with envy as Jos Verstappen and Schiattarella {{demonstrated}} {{the promise of the}} new car, <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> his funds had taken a battering after the devastating Kobe earthquake. It contributed to Simtek's mounting financial problems, resulting in the team's closure after Monaco. Noda never even got to drive the car; he was forced to forfeit his deposit {{and the rest of his}} 1995 went up in smoke. The Forti team attempted to enter him in the 1995 Pacific Grand Prix in place of Roberto Moreno, but he was denied an FIA Super Licence despite his previous experience. He was also considered for a drive at the team in , but the seat went to Luca Badoer instead.|$|E
25|$|Remington Rand {{also made}} a {{significant}} number of false and misleading statements designed to mislead the media, demoralize strikers and reassure investors. Sixteen days into the strike, for example, company president James Rand announced an end to the strike at all six plants, a statement which roiled the union and led hundreds of workers to mistakenly accuse elected union leaders of selling out. In fact, no agreement had been reached. Two weeks later, Remington Rand announced that workers in Ohio had returned to work under a new collective bargaining agreement which offered highly favorable terms. The announcement demoralized workers in New York and Connecticut, and raised suspicions about the competence and reliability of union leaders. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> only 21 of the 911 workers at the plant had accepted these terms, and they had not supported the strike. A few days later, Remington Rand officials falsely claimed that 5,300 of the company's workers had crossed picket lines and were back at work.|$|E
25|$|Following his graduation, Chikatilo {{applied for}} a {{scholarship}} at Moscow State University. Although he passed the entrance examination with good-to-excellent scores, his grades were not deemed good enough for acceptance. Chikatilo speculated his scholarship application was rejected due to his father's tainted war record (his father had been branded a traitor for being taken prisoner in 1943), but <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> other students had performed better in a highly competitive exam. He {{did not attempt to}} enroll at another university; instead, he travelled to the city of Kursk, where he worked as a labourer for three months before—in 1955—enrolling in a vocational school, where he studied to become a communications technician. The same year, Chikatilo formed his first serious relationship, with a local girl two years his junior. On three separate occasions, the couple attempted intercourse, although on each occasion, Chikatilo was unable to sustain an erection. After 18 months, the girl broke off their relationship.|$|E

500|$|Severely damaged during Welsh rebellions in {{the early}} fourteenth century, Castell Coch fell into disuse and by the Tudor period, the antiquary John Leland {{described}} it as [...] "all in ruin no big thing but high." [...] A set of drawings for the planned rebuilding exists, together with a full architectural justification by Burges. The castle reconstruction features three conical roofs to the towers that are historically questionable. According to Crook, Burges [...] "supported his roofs with a considerable body of examples of doubtful validity; <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he wanted them for their architectural effect." ...|$|E
2500|$|Boll {{made many}} claims {{later in life}} {{that she was an}} heiress and {{was a member of a}} wealthy family. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> her father, George, was a {{bartender}} in Rochester, New York. She was, however, attractive, a short, dark-eyed, and [...] "vividly blonde" [...] beauty. Her early employment was selling cigars in Rochester. [...] Boll became an experienced horse rider, and married businessman Robert Scott in 1909. In 1914 she had a son, Robert Scott II.|$|E

2500|$|Smuts’s {{departure}} from the Cape was perhaps {{less to do with}} politics than he was later inclined to suggest; as an uitlander, he would be barred from voting until he had fulfilled the fourteen-year residency requirement. [...] Certainly he now found the Cape political environment uncongenial, but <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> despite his views on Kruger’s republic, he hoped that it would a young man better career opportunities than he had found in the Cape. [...] Smuts left for the Transvaal on 20 January 1897.|$|E
2500|$|A public {{announcement}} of the fast ferry project was made in June, 1994; it had been decided to immediately proceed with building three fast ferries. The government claimed the fast ferries would cost $210 million total, and Clark later insisted that this figure had included everything [...] "right down to the toilet paper." [...] <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> little actual analysis had been done: not even the type of ship (single hull or catamaran), nor their dimensions had even been determined when the $210 million figure was announced.|$|E
2500|$|... "There {{are stories}} that I quit Sabbat because {{the rest of}} the band didn't like my pagan lyrics. That's not true. All of us shared an {{interest}} in paganism. The paganism was never a problem; I was always left {{to get on with the}} lyrics the best way I saw fit. No, <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> I could see that the music was going to get even more complex. Andy was writing 11 minute musical epics and I couldn't even begin to see how I'd write lyrics for something like that. I wanted to bring in other musical styles, to bring in violins for instance. That would never have worked with Sabbat." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early on, when Johnson {{was unable}} to pay off his debts, he began to work with {{professional}} writers and identified his own situation with theirs. During this time, Johnson witnessed Christopher Smart's decline into [...] "penury and the madhouse", and feared that he might share the same fate. In joking about Christopher Smart's madness, his writing for the Universal Visiter, and his own contributions, Johnson claimed: [...] "for poor Smart, while he was mad, not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write... I hoped his wits would return to him. Mine returned to me, and I wrote in 'the Universal Visitor' no longer". <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Johnson wrote for the Universal Visiter as an [...] "act of charity" [...] to the ailing Smart.|$|E
2500|$|The Adelaide Oval had {{produced}} another draw {{to leave the}} series tied on 1-1, but the three hours lost on Australia Day would have probably have given England enough {{time to make the}} extra 133 runs required for victory, {{but it would have been}} an historic victory if they had. Ted Dexter said afterwards [...] "Australia never had a hope of bowling us out - [...] not on this pitch and with their attack so depleted". This took some of the heat off Richie Benaud whose reputation for [...] "go-ahead", entertaining cricket had taken a severe blow by his refusal to declare on the last morning. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Australian bowling attack depended heavily on the injury-prone Alan Davidson and Benaud with the young McKenzie and two batting all rounders in support. Without any turn in the pitch to help Benaud or Simpson Australia were in great trouble. With the retirement of their two premier bowlers Garth McKenzie would have to carry the Australian bowling through the 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|According to Diana Muir the {{earliest}} identified {{use of the}} phrase by an opponent of Zionism occurred shortly after Britain issued the Balfour Declaration. Muir also cites other pre-statehood uses, including one in 1918 by Ameer Rihami, a Lebanese-American, Christian Arab nationalist, who wrote that [...] "I would even say ... 'Give the land without a people to the people without a land' if Palestine were really without a people and if the Jews were really without a land". Rihami argued that Jews needed no homeland in Palestine because they enjoyed everywhere else [...] "equal rights and equal opportunity, to say the least". And a use by someone she describes as an early twentieth-century academic Arabist who wrote that, [...] "Their very slogan, 'The land without a people for the people without a land,' was an insult to Arabs of the country". American journalist William McCrackan said, [...] "We used to read in our papers the slogan of Zionism, 'to give back a people to a Land without a People,' while <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Palestine was already well-peopled with a population which was rapidly increasing from natural causes".|$|E
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Mameena <b>was</b> one {{of those}} women who sticks in a man's mind even more closely than a [...] "Wait-a-bit" [...] thorn does in his coat.|$|R

2500|$|Drummond and Cauty later {{portrayed the}} song {{as the result}} of a {{deliberate}} effort to write a number one hit single. In interviews with Snub TV and BBC Radio 1, Drummond said that <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they had intended to make a house record using the Doctor Who theme. After Cauty had laid down a basic track, Drummond observed that their house idea wasn't working and what they actually had was a Glitter beat. Sensing the opportunity to make a commercial pop record they abandoned all notions of underground credibility and went instead for the lowest common denominator. According to the British music press, the result was [...] "rancid", [...] "pure, unadulterated agony" [...] and [...] "excruciating" [...] and– in something of a backhanded compliment from the normally supportive Sounds Magazine– [...] "a record so noxious that a top ten place can be its only destiny". They were right: the record went on to sell over one million copies. A single of The Timelords' remixes of the song was released: [...] "Gary Joins The JAMs" [...] featured original vocal contributions from Glitter himself, who also appeared on Top of the Pops to promote the song with The Timelords.|$|E
2500|$|The {{offensive}} {{was undertaken}} {{in the hope of}} triggering a general uprising, but urban Vietnamese did not respond as the Việt Cộng anticipated. About 75,000 communist soldiers were killed or wounded, according to Trần Văn Trà, commander of the [...] "B-2" [...] district, which consisted of southern South Vietnam. [...] "We did not base ourselves on scientific calculation or a careful weighing of all factors, but...on an illusion based on our subjective desires", Trà concluded. Earle G. Wheeler, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimated that Tet resulted in 40,000 communist dead (compared to about 10,600 U.S. and South Vietnamese dead). [...] "It is a major irony of the Vietnam War that our propaganda transformed this debacle into a brilliant victory. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Tet cost us half our forces. Our losses were so immense that we were unable to replace them with new recruits", said PRG Justice Minister Trương Như Tảng. Tet had a profound psychological impact because South Vietnamese cities were otherwise safe areas during the war. U.S. President Lyndon Johnson and Westmoreland argued that panicky news coverage gave the public the unfair perception that America had been defeated.|$|E
2500|$|The Act criminalised {{unauthorised}} alterations, or demolitions, to a listed building, so {{in theory}} at least, all historic buildings were now safe from unauthorised demolition. <b>The</b> <b>truth</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Act was rarely enforced, {{only a few}} buildings were listed, over half of them by just one council, Winchelsea. Elsewhere, the fines levied on those failing {{to comply with the}} Act were far less than the profit from redeveloping a site. Little changed. In 1946, in what has been described as [...] "an act of sheer class-war vindictiveness", Britain's Labour Government insisted on the destruction, by open cast mining, of the park and formal gardens of Wentworth Woodhouse, Britain's largest country house. [...] The Minister of Fuel and Power, Manny Shinwell, insisted, as 300-year-old oaks were uprooted, that [...] "the park be mined right up to the mansion's door." [...] Meanwhile, plans by the socialist government to wrest the house from its owner, the Earl Fitzwilliam, and convert the architecturally important house for [...] "homeless industrial families" [...] were only abandoned at the eleventh hour when Earl Fitzwilliam, through the auspices of his socialist sister, agreed to its conversion to a college—a lesser fate. This was the political climate in which many families abandoned the houses their families had owned for generations.|$|E
