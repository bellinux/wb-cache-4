5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} campaign, Fletcher attempted to make the expansion of casino gambling, rather than the merit system investigation, <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue.</b> Beshear favored holding a referendum on {{a constitutional amendment to}} allow expanded casino gambling in the state, while Fletcher maintained that expanded gambling would bring an increase in crime and societal ills. The gambling issue failed to gain as much traction as the hiring scandal, however, and Beshear defeated Fletcher by a vote of 619,686 to 435,895.|$|E
5|$|Sparked by the 1848 Whitman Massacre, {{a number}} of violent battles were fought between American {{settlers}} and the region's natives. The subsequent Indian Wars, especially the Yakima War, decimated the native population and removed much land from native control. As years progressed, the right of natives to fish along the Columbia became <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue</b> of contention with the states, commercial fishers, and private property owners. The US Supreme Court upheld fishing rights in landmark cases in 1905 and 1918, {{as well as the}} 1974 case United States v. Washington, commonly called the Boldt Decision.|$|E
5|$|Although Desha {{was clearly}} {{aligned with the}} Relief faction, the faction's leader was John Adair, {{a veteran of the}} War of 1812 whose {{popularity}} was augmented because of his very public defense of the Kentuckians who served under him at the Battle of New Orleans against charges of cowardice by Andrew Jackson. Adair won a close election with 20,493 votes, besting William Logan's 19,947 votes, Desha's 12,418 votes, and Anthony Butler's 9,567 votes. Relief partisans also secured control of both houses of the Kentucky General Assembly. Much debt relief legislation was passed during Adair's term, but as his term neared expiration, the Kentucky Court of Appeals struck down one popular and expansive debt relief law as unconstitutional, ensuring that debt relief would again be <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue</b> in the upcoming gubernatorial election.|$|E

5|$|Beshear was {{the first}} {{candidate}} to announce his bid for the post of Attorney General of Kentucky in the 1979 election. Shortly after declaring his candidacy, he was endorsed by outgoing Attorney General Robert F. Stephens. <b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue</b> of Beshear's campaign was his pledge to be an advocate of the consumer in cases of proposed utility rate hikes. After winning the Democratic primary, he defeated Republican nominee Ron Snyder {{by a vote of}} 471,177 to 302,951. When incumbent Attorney General Stephens resigned in December 1979 to accept an appointment to the Kentucky Supreme Court, Beshear was appointed to fill the vacancy until his term officially began in January. As attorney general, Beshear created the state's first Medicaid fraud division and his office took {{a leading role in the}} Leviticus Project, an eight-state coalition committed to prosecuting organized crime in the country's coal fields.|$|E
5|$|Regulations {{require that}} {{scientists}} use as few animals as possible, especially for terminal experiments. However, while policy makers consider suffering to be <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue</b> and see animal euthanasia {{as a way}} to reduce suffering, others, such as the RSPCA, argue that the lives of laboratory animals have intrinsic value. Regulations focus on whether particular methods cause pain and suffering, not whether their death is undesirable in itself. The animals are euthanized at the end of studies for sample collection or post-mortem examination; during studies if their pain or suffering falls into certain categories regarded as unacceptable, such as depression, infection that is unresponsive to treatment, or the failure of large animals to eat for five days; or when they are unsuitable for breeding or unwanted for some other reason.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue</b> in {{behavioral}} finance is explaining why market participants make irrational systematic errors contrary to assumption of rational market participants.

The study of behavioral finance also investigates how other participants take advantage (arbitrage) of such errors and market inefficiencies.|$|E

25|$|Characterizing the {{accuracy}} of test scores is perhaps <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue</b> in psychometric theory and is a chief difference between IRT and CTT.

25|$|The 1967 presidential elections, {{conducted}} by a secret poll of National Assembly members, pitted former prime minister Shermarke against Osman. Again <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue</b> was moderation versus militancy on the pan-Somali question. Osman, through Hussein, had stressed priority for internal development. Shermarke, who had served as prime minister when pan-Somalism was at its height, {{was elected president of}} the republic.|$|E
25|$|By 1953, the West Irian dispute {{had become}} <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue</b> in Indonesian {{domestic}} politics. All political parties across the Indonesian political spectrum, particularly the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), supported Sukarno's efforts to integrate West Irian into the Indonesian Republic. According to the historians Audrey and George McTurnan Kahin, the PKI's pro-integration stance helped {{the party to}} rebuild its political base and to further its credentials as a nationalist Communist Party that supported Sukarno.|$|E
25|$|Nationalization was <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue</b> in the 1978 elections; the NDP {{held its}} own but the Liberals {{were wiped out}} and the Progressive Conservative party grew.

It introduced a guaranteed income supplement for senior citizens, a family income plan for the working poor, a children's dental service, and a prescription drug plan.|$|E

25|$|Parliament was {{dissolved}} {{and elections}} called, with Irish Home Rule <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue.</b> Gladstone hoped to repeat his triumph of 1868, when he fought {{and won a}} General Election to obtain a mandate for Irish Disestablishment (which had been {{a major cause of}} dispute between Conservatives and Liberals since the 1830s), but the result of the July 1886 general election was Liberal defeat. The Conservatives and the Liberal Unionist Party returned with a majority of 118 over the combined Gladstonian Liberals and Parnell's 85 Irish Party seats. Salisbury formed his second government – a minority Conservative government with Liberal Unionist support.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{noted that}} Mulroney had {{originally}} professed opposition to free trade during the 1983 leadership campaign. This agreement was controversial, and the Senate demanded an election before proceeding to a ratification vote. The Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement was <b>the</b> <b>central</b> <b>issue</b> of the 1988 election, with the Liberals and NDP opposing it. With the Liberals gaining the initial momentum, a successful counterattack by Allan Gregg {{resulted in the}} PCs being re-elected with a solid but reduced majority and 43 {{percent of the popular}} vote. Mulroney thus became the only Conservative, in the 20th century, to lead his party to consecutive majority governments during peacetime. In this election, Mulroney transferred to another eastern Quebec seat, Charlevoix, after an electoral redistribution saw its boundary shift to include Baie-Comeau.|$|E
25|$|In the United States the FISA act (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) {{along with}} the {{amendments}} made to it in 2008 {{can be considered a}} similar bill to that of the Canadian bill C-30. The FISA protects telecommunications companies complicit in providing user information to federal law enforcement authorities. In addition to this the 2008 amendments, which were extended another five years at the end of 2012, allow the NSA (National Security Agency) to conduct electronic surveillance on any US citizen suspected of conversing with any person outside of the USA suspected by the US government of terrorist activities.
