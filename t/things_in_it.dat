500|$|Some of Ibn Khaldūn's thoughts, {{according}} to some commentators, anticipate the biological theory of evolution. In 1377, Ibn Khaldūn wrote the Muqaddimah in which he asserted that humans developed from [...] "the world of the monkeys," [...] in a process by which [...] "species become more numerous" [...] In chapter 1 he writes: [...] "This world with all the created <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> has a certain order and solid construction. It shows nexuses between causes and things caused, combinations of some parts of creation with others, and transformations of some existent things into others, in a pattern that is both remarkable and endless." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series creator Chris Carter and {{directed}} by Rob Bowman. Bowman was {{not a fan of}} the episode, saying [...] "The show proved to be much more difficult than I anticipated, and there wasn't enough time to shoot the show properly because we were so close to the Christmas break. I felt extremely pressured and frustrated, although there are <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> I love, particularly the banter between Mulder and Scully. But overall, I thought the show was very oblique. I don't feel that the characters ever {{knew what was going on}} and I don't think it is all that cool that kids are murdering people. I didn't feel like I was shooting an episode of the X-Files, and I think I let Chris Carter down a bit." ...|$|E
500|$|Harring {{described}} her interpretation {{after seeing the}} film: [...] "When I saw it the first time, I {{thought it was the}} story of Hollywood dreams, illusion and obsession. It touches on the idea that nothing is quite as it seems, especially the idea of being a Hollywood movie star. The second and third times I saw it, I thought it dealt with identity. Do we know who we are? And then I kept seeing different <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>it...</b> There's no right or wrong to what someone takes away from it or what they think the film is really about. It's a movie that makes you continuously ponder, makes you ask questions. I've heard over and over, 'This is a movie that I'll see again' or 'This is a movie you've got to see again.' It intrigues you. You want to get it, but I don't think it's a movie to be gotten. It's achieved its goal if it makes you ask questions." ...|$|E

500|$|Bradford Wright {{described}} Watchmen as [...] "Moore's obituary for {{the concept}} of heroes in general and superheroes in particular." [...] Putting the story in a contemporary sociological context, Wright wrote that the characters of Watchmen were Moore's [...] "admonition to those who trusted in 'heroes' and leaders to guard the world's fate". He added that to place faith in such icons was to give up personal responsibility to [...] "the Reagans, Thatchers, and other 'Watchmen' of the world who supposed to 'rescue' us and perhaps lay waste to the planet in the process". Moore specifically stated in 1986 that he was writing Watchmen to be [...] "not anti-Americanism, [...] anti-Reaganism", specifically believing that [...] "at the moment a certain part of Reagan's America isn't scared. They think they're invulnerable." [...] Before the series premiered, Gibbons stated: [...] "There's no overt political message at all. It's a fantasy extrapolation of what might happen and if people can see <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> that apply to the real America, then they're reading it into the comic [...]" [...] While Moore {{wanted to write about}} [...] "power politics" [...] and the [...] "worrying" [...] times he lived in, he stated the reason that the story was set in an alternate reality was because he was worried that readers would [...] "switch off" [...] if he attacked a leader they admired. Moore stated in 1986 that he [...] "was consciously trying to do something that would make people feel uneasy." ...|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. IGN contributor Robert Canning rated the episode an 8 out of 10, saying it [...] "gave all {{the main characters}} an opportunity to shine" [...] and that the episode [...] "delivered some great laughs and elevated some standard sit-com plots to a much funnier level." [...] He argued that Liz helped make the episode good. Though, Canning found Elisa's secret disappointing and felt that Salma Hayek's exit from the show too much like a conventional sitcom. Entertainment Weeklys Aly Semigran wrote that the episode gave good character revelations about Tracy, Jenna, and Kenneth, but that episode did not exceed expectations from the previous week's episode, [...] "Jackie Jormp-Jomp". Writing for The Star-Ledger Alan Sepinwall reported that despite the episode not being a 30 Rock classic it [...] "had more than enough funny <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> to keep me satisfied." [...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin wrote that [...] "The Ones" [...] felt [...] "a little stock" [...] {{but that it was}} [...] "just pretty good." [...] He further added that [...] "" [...] gag featured in this episode [...] "was mildly amusing but a little obvious." [...] He felt that Elisa's secret felt more like a Soap opera secret than a 30 Rock one. Nonetheless, Rabin gave [...] "The Ones" [...] a B-. David Bauder of the Guelph Mercury, however, was complimentary towards Hayek's guest appearances throughout season 3, noting, that they are [...] "the best this absurdist comedy has to offer. Hayek throws herself into her role with gusto, matching Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin step for silly step".|$|E
2500|$|In {{subsequent}} years, {{according to}} Berlioz biographer David Cairns, {{the work was}} thought of as [...] "a noble white elephant [...] something with beautiful <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> but too long and supposedly full of dead wood.

2500|$|Overall, Budden {{agrees with}} the {{opinions}} of the others noted above, but he does emphasize that while it is a work of [...] "brilliant patches... the best <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> surpass anything that Verdi had written up to that time" [...] and he regards the soprano part to be of [...] "rare distinction" [...] and the solo numbers and many of the ensembles to be of [...] "high caliber." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert {{liked the}} film and the screenplay, writing, [...] "This is a good small movie, sweet and sentimental, about a kid who never really {{got a chance to}} show his stuff.

2500|$|It is {{explained}} in the novel as follows: [...] "To believe in a contradiction is to abdicate your belief {{in the existence of}} the world around you {{and the nature of the}} <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> to instead embrace any random impulse that strikes your fancy – to imagine something is real simply because you wish it were. A thing is what it is, it is itself. There can be no contradictions. In reality, contradictions cannot exist. To believe in them you must abandon the most important thing you possess: your rational mind. The wager for such a bargain is your life. In such an exchange, you always lose what you have at stake." ...|$|E

2500|$|Raimi and Tapert {{ran into}} {{conflicts}} with the studio during post-production. The director {{had a problem with}} the editor that the studio assigned him and eight weeks into assembling the rough cut, he was not following Raimi's storyboards. The editor had a nervous breakdown and left. Early preview screenings did not go well as people laughed in the wrong places and complained about a lack of a happy ending. Universal told Raimi that some people rated Darkman the worst film they had ever seen. According to executives, the film was one of the worst-scoring pictures in Universal's history. Then, two preview screenings, one with Danny Elfman's score, went well. Tapert remembers, [...] "the experience on Darkman was very difficult for Sam and me; it isn't the picture we thought it should be, based on the footage we shot and all that. The studio got nervous about some kind of wild <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> and made us take them out, which was unfortunate." [...] However, Raimi did like the [...] "brilliant" [...] marketing campaign that the studio came up with, releasing posters in advance with a silhouette of the main character and the question, [...] "Who is Darkman?" [...] According to the director, [...] "the marketing made the film a money-maker." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{consensus}} on Ashton's Ondine {{is that it}} has some very good <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> – and this is true; as is the implication that it is otherwise unsuccessful, not least because the music (which greatly disappointed Ashton himself) largely fails, except in the storm of Act II and the divertissements of Act III. According to many critics, the music did not suit Ashton [...] "who had been hoping for music as [...] "radiant" [...] as the Mediterranean from which its heroine was born". Yet the music does seem to fit its watery theme well: there are some beautiful passages to Ondine’s Act 3 [...] "swimming" [...] solo where the music seems thin and transparent as watercolour, and entirely suited to this sketch of the sea. The ballet is also a mixture of both the 19th and the 20th century, for the plot is quintessentially romantic while the music and choreography are more modern. Although it bore all the marks of Ashton's familiarly gentle, classically oriented manner, it discarded the classical ballet conventions that appear in such Ashton successes as Cinderella and Sylvia. What he was trying to suggest, says Ashton, was [...] "the ebb and flow of the sea: I aimed at an unbroken continuity of dance, which would remove the distinction between aria and recitative." [...] As a result, Ondine offered few pyrotechnics, gained its effects instead through sinuous mass movements in which the undulation of arm and body suggested forests of sea plants stirring to unseen tides. The sense of submarine fantasy was reinforced by Stage Designer Lila de Nobili's fine scenery: a castle of mist and fruitfulness, shadowy crags and waterfalls, aqueous skies streaked pink and green.|$|E
