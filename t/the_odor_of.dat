5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius torminosus contain {{a number of}} sterols, of which {{ergosterol}} (a component of fungal cell walls) is the most predominant at 60.5% of all sterols, followed by its derivatives and ergosta-5/7-dien-3-ol (17.0%), ergost-7-en-3-ol (13.7%) and ergosta-7-22-dien-3-ol (8.3%). Researchers have identified 28 volatile compounds that contribute to <b>the</b> <b>odor</b> <b>of</b> the mushroom. Many of these are alcohols and carbonyl compounds with eight carbon atoms; the predominant volatile compound (about 90%) is 1-octen-3-one, an odorant common in mushrooms.|$|E

40|$|Social {{information}} can be acquired {{either directly or indirectly}} from cues inadvertently produced by individuals with similar interests and requirements (“inadvertent social information,” ISI). These inadvertent cues provide “public information” that other individuals can use to guide their behavior. We show here that female mice use olfactory ISI to determine their choice of, and responses to, males and that the use of this ISI involves the gene for oxytocin (OT). Female mice (OT wild type and CF- 1 strain) displayed a significant interest in, and choice <b>of,</b> <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> uninfected males of varying sexual status that were associated with <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> an another estrous female. This recognition of, and choices for, specific, individual male odors was evident 24 h later. Female mice also distinguished between males subclinically infected with the gastrointestinal nematode parasite, Heligimosomoides polygyrus, and nonparasitized males, displaying aversive responses (analgesia, increased corticosterone) to, and avoidance <b>of,</b> <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> infected males. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> another estrous female with that of the infected male, which are indicative of potential mate interests, attenuated these aversive responses and resulted in a choice for <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> infected male. OT gene-deficient (knockout) females were impaired in their use of this ISI to modulate their responses to either uninfected males of differing sexual states or infected males. These findings suggest that OT genes are necessary for the processing of inadvertent social information and likely the integration of both direct and indirect social information...|$|R

40|$|Infections {{have been}} shown to alter body odor. Because immune {{activation}} accompanies both infection and immunization, we tested the hypothesis that classical immunization might similarly result in <b>the</b> alteration <b>of</b> body <b>odors</b> detectable by trained biosensor mice. Using a Y-maze, we trained biosensor mice to distinguish between urine odors from rabies-vaccinated (RV) and unvaccinated control mice. RV-trained mice generalized this training to mice immunized with the equine West Nile virus (WNV) vaccine compared with urine of corresponding controls. These results suggest that there are similarities between body <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> mice immunized with these two vaccines. This conclusion was reinforced when mice could not be trained to directly discriminate between urine <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> RV- versus WNV-treated mice. Next,we trained biosensor mice to discriminate <b>the</b> urine <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS; a general elicitor of innate immunological responses) from the urine of control mice.

Finally, biosensor mice trained to distinguish between <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> RV-treated mouse urine and control mouse urine did not generalize this training to discriminate between <b>the</b> <b>odors</b> <b>of</b> LPS-treated mouse urine and control mouse urine.
