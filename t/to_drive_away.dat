5|$|American crows are {{protected}} internationally by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Despite attempts by humans {{in some areas}} <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>away</b> or eliminate these birds, they remain widespread and very common. The number of individual American crows is estimated by BirdLife International to be around 31,000,000. The large population, {{as well as its}} vast range, are the reasons why the American crow is considered to be of least concern, meaning that the species is not threatened.|$|E

The yard's owner {{was at the time}} on a hunt close to the yard and drove directly to it. A group of burglars jumped into their car and attempted <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>away.</b> The owner used his shotgun and attempted to shoot the car's tires, hitting and wounding two of its occupants. He was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment for intentional infliction of bodily harm, a sentence that was confirmed on appeal. The owner received full presidential pardon.|$|E
5|$|Males of fly {{species such}} as Cuterebra, many hover flies, bee flies (Bombyliidae) and fruit flies (Tephritidae) {{maintain}} territories within which they engage in aerial pursuit <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>away</b> intruding males and other species. While these territories may be held by individual males, some species form leks with many males aggregating in displays. Some flies maintain an airspace and still others form dense swarms that maintain a stationary location with respect to landmarks. Many flies mate in flight while swarming.|$|E
5|$|Pontiac's War has {{traditionally}} been portrayed as a defeat for the Native Americans, but scholars now usually {{view it as a}} military stalemate: while the Native Americans had failed <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>away</b> the British, the British were unable to conquer the Native Americans. Negotiation and accommodation, rather than success on the battlefield, ultimately brought an end to the war. The Native Americans had in fact won a victory of sorts by compelling the British government to abandon Amherst's policies and instead create a relationship with the Native Americans modeled on the Franco-Native alliance.|$|E

5|$|The robin also sings when storms {{approach}} and again when storms have passed. In {{addition to its}} song, the American robin {{has a number of}} calls used for communicating specific information such as when a ground predator approaches, and when a nest or robin is being directly threatened. Even during nesting season, when robins exhibit mostly competitive and territorial behavior, they may still band together <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>away</b> a predator.|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{adults do}} not have many predators, but human {{activities}} pose many threats. Collisions with power lines, hunting, intentional poisoning, lead accumulation from ingesting gunshot in carcasses, and pesticide accumulation take a toll on populations. Young birds at the nest are sometimes taken by golden eagles, eagle owls, and red foxes. Only rarely do adult birds attempt <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>away</b> predators. Young birds that fall off of cliff ledges may be preyed on by mammalian predators such as jackals, foxes and wolves. Like all birds they serve as hosts for ectoparasitic birdlice including Aegypoecus perspicuus as well as organisms that live within them such as mycoplasmas.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Fringe {{division}} is falsely told that their Olivia has escaped. Agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), still needing hyperbaric treatment to regrow his skin after being burned, and Agent Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) follow a tracking device on Henry's taxi. When {{they arrive at}} the station, Olivia orders Henry <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>away,</b> and manages to fire at a small valve on a gas tank, allowing the explosion to cover their trail. Walternate, watching the altercation on monitors, notes Olivia has gained the marksmanship ability that the alternate Olivia possesses, and begins to think the serum is working. Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes in a later conversation that the rush of adrenaline effectively enhanced the potency of his chemical agents to brainwash Olivia.|$|E

5|$|A {{different}} call is {{emitted by}} a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted by another male. This is a distinct chirruping sound and {{is accompanied by a}} vibration of the body. Tree frogs and some non-aquatic species have a rain call that they make on the basis of humidity cues prior to a shower. Many species also have a territorial call that is used <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>away</b> other males. All of these calls are emitted with the mouth of the frog closed. A distress call, emitted by some frogs when they are in danger, is produced with the mouth open resulting in a higher-pitched call. It is typically used when the frog has been grabbed by a predator and may serve to distract or disorientate the attacker so that it releases the frog.|$|E
5|$|In Matamoros and Brownsville, curanderos – {{practitioners}} of curanderismo – offered works {{of white and}} black magic. These services are known as brujería (witchcraft). People consult healers and fortune tellers for help with relationships: to revive their romance, to end a marriage, to make someone fall in love, or to hurt someone. People also consult them <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>away</b> negative energy, predict the future and dangerous events, to improve their health, or to bring positive energy. Cisneros grew closer to curanderismo after her firstborn, David, died after being thrown from a moving vehicle by a friend {{while he was in}} St. Joe in 1974. People close to Cisneros described her as a person who endured several tragic events growing up. One of her uncles committed suicide when she was young, and her brother drowned as a teenager. But, several others who were close to her maintained that after her son died, Cisneros started to show signs of insanity, became more protective of her children, and began visiting local curanderas.|$|E
5|$|Once {{out of the}} hospital, Johnny Sack's {{daughter}} gets {{married and}} the Soprano family attends. There, Tony is shown very exhausted when taking off his shoes through security. In the process, he collapses to the ground, but is not hurt. Before the wedding, Johnny Sack is approved to leave prison for six hours to see his daughter get married, but {{has to pay for}} the metal detectors and the presence of the U.S. marshals at the event. As his daughter is about <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>away,</b> the SUV that was escorting Johnny to the wedding blocks the car from leaving and an altercation begins in the driveway. In a moment of weakness and despair, Johnny Sack cries as he is put back into handcuffs and driven back to prison, greatly diminishing the respect his crew and Tony's crew have for him.|$|E

5|$|Rowley {{dismissed}} {{this idea}} given the shattered state of Africaine and instead towed the frigate back to Île Bourbon, shadowed by Astrée and Iphigénie {{on the return}} journey. The French frigates did achieve some consolation in pursuing Rowley from a distance, running into and capturing the Honourable East India Company's armed brig Aurora, sent from India to reinforce Rowley. On 15 September, Boadicea, Africaine and the brigs arrived at Saint Paul, Africaine sheltering under the fortifications of the harbour while the others put to sea, again seeking <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>away</b> the French blockade but unable {{to bring them to}} action. Bouvet returned to Port Napoleon on 18 September, and thus was not present when Rowley attacked and captured the French flagship Vénus and Commodore Hamelin at the Action of 18 September 1810.|$|E
5|$|The {{third group}} {{was made up}} of tribes of the Ohio Country: Delawares (Lenape), Shawnee, Wyandot, and Mingo. These people had {{migrated}} to the Ohio valley earlier in the century from the mid-Atlantic and other eastern areas in order to escape British, French, and Iroquois domination in the New York and Pennsylvania area. Unlike the Great Lakes and Illinois Country tribes, Ohio Native Americans had no great attachment to the French regime. They had fought as French allies in the previous war in an effort <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>away</b> the British. They made a separate peace with the British with the understanding that the British Army would withdraw from the Ohio Country. But after the departure of the French, the British strengthened their forts in the region rather than abandoning them, and so the Ohioans went to war in 1763 in another attempt to drive out the British.|$|E
5|$|As marine furs became {{depleted}} in {{the early}} 19th century, American ship captains began to accept increasing numbers of land furs such as beaver, which were brought from the interior to the coast via indigenous trade networks from New Caledonia—today the Omineca and Nechako districts of the Central Interior of British Columbia. During the 1820s, the British Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), which considered the interior fur trade to be its domain, began to experience significant losses {{as a result of}} this diversion of furs to the coast. To protect its interests, the HBC entered the coast trade <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>away</b> the American traders. This goal was achieved during the 1830s. By 1841, the American traders had abandoned the North West Coast. For a time, the North West Coast trade was controlled by the HBC and the RAC. Following the 1846 resolution of the Oregon Territory controversy between the United States and England, and the American purchase of Alaska in 1867, American hunters returned to hunting sea otters in the region, both from land and sea. Hunting throughout the Aleutian and Kuril Islands by American commercial outfits also contributed to the near-extinction of the species by the late 1800s.|$|E
