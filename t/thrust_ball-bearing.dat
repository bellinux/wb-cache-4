50|$|The jack is {{rigid and}} robust. The upright column is {{fabricated}} and welded to the cast steel Gear Box. The elevating screw {{is provided with}} buttress thread supported with single-acting <b>thrust</b> <b>ball-bearing</b> having a spherical seating {{at the top and}} self-aligning ball-bearing at the bottom. This imparts self-aligning properties to the screw under loaded condition. The elevating screw is under tension when loaded and hence there is no chance of distortion due to buckling.While lifting the load, the Jack rests firmly on its base. For movement from one place to another, the lifting carriage is to be lowered by pressing the yoke which lifts the base and the Jack rests on the three wheels with a ground clearance of 20 mm.|$|E
