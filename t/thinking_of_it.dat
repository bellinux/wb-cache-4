5|$|Adults who {{do believe}} that zero is even can {{nevertheless}} be unfamiliar with <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as even, enough so to measurably slow them down in a reaction time experiment. Stanislas Dehaene, {{a pioneer in the}} field of numerical cognition, led a series of such experiments in the early 1990s. A numeral or a number word is flashed to the subject on a monitor, and a computer records the time it takes the subject to push one of two buttons to identify the number as odd or even. The results showed that 0 was slower to process than other even numbers. Some variations of the experiment found delays as long as 60 milliseconds or about 10% of the average reaction time—a small difference but a significant one.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} that started Dan <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> was when Adam was injured because he couldn't hear his father's call of warning nor see his sign language. The ER doctor who stitched Adam's wound mentioned a cochlear implant, and though Dan instantly refused to even consider it, {{he began to}} investigate the option on his own. Throughout the movie, other flashbacks show similar situations where hearing would be advantageous in everyday life. On {{the other side of}} the coin, other moments show how being deaf helps prevent distraction.|$|E
25|$|On May 22, 1939, the Pact of Steel {{was signed}} by Galeazzo Ciano and German foreign {{minister}} Joachim von Ribbentrop, effectively allying the two powers. Despite the fairly good relations the two states had had, many Italians were against this alliance, <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> {{as more of a}} submission to Germany, knowing that Italian interests were likely not to be favored in the relationship. The alliance also technically forced Italy to join in any war that Germany had entered, so that Germany could at any time present the treaty and force Mussolini to enter, though they did not end up using this right.|$|E

25|$|When I {{first started}} doing the stain paintings, I left {{large areas of}} canvas unpainted, I think, because the canvas itself acted as forcefully and as {{positively}} as paint or line or color. In other words, the very ground {{was part of the}} medium, so that instead of <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as background or negative space or an empty spot, that area did not need paint because it had paint next to it. The thing was to decide where to leave it and where to fill it and where to say this doesn't need another line or another pail of colors. It's saying it in space.|$|E

In order to prepare for the role, Chopra visited several mental institutions and spent time with autistic people.

Chopra told that she had to let go of every inhibition probably that she had as a Hindi film heroine and play Jhilmil without <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> She explained that she needed two moments to become Jhilmil because she didn't identify with her character due to difference between her thought and behavior.|$|E

[...] And then on April 19, 1872: [...] "Had a talk with Chester about the astounding proposition made to me in the winter. We agreed it was monstrous and must be prevented. Chester said he is determined, when he got home, to expose the matter." [...] Author Farley Mowat has suggested the officers were contemplating faking a journey to the Pole, or at least to a very high latitude.|$|E

[...] We talked about it a little bit, and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm.

But I do remember <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|E

500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think we pick up on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E

2500|$|McCartney {{was living}} in Jane Asher's parents' house when he found the {{inspiration}} for the song: [...] "I was laying in bed in the Ashers' garret...

It was pretty much my song as I recall... I think John helped out. The lyrics got more and more obscure as it goes on, but the chorus, melody and verses are mine." [...] The song began as being about different coloured submarines, but evolved to include only a yellow one.|$|E
2500|$|Recall {{the earlier}} {{discussion}} about administrative controls, logical controls, and physical controls.
