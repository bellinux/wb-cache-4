5|$|After the Virginia Tech kickoff {{and a short}} return, Miami {{began the}} first drive of the game at its 32-yard line. The game's first play was an {{incomplete}} pass from Miami quarterback Jim Kelly. After a one-yard rush, Kelly completed his first pass of the game, an 18-yard toss that drove Miami to the Tech 49-yard line and gave <b>the</b> <b>Hurricanes</b> a first down. Miami then committed a 15-yard penalty, pushing <b>the</b> <b>Hurricanes</b> back into {{their side of the}} field. On the second play after the penalty, Kelly completed a 29-yard pass that gave Miami a first down. <b>The</b> <b>Hurricanes</b> were further aided by a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty against Virginia Tech, giving Miami a first down at the Tech 20-yard line. From there, it took Miami just three plays to score a touchdown, the final play being a 15-yard pass from Kelly to Larry Brodsky. With 12:37 remaining in the quarter, Miami took a 70 lead.|$|E

5|$|Bowman {{made the}} Hurricanes' roster out of {{training}} camp in 2010–11, but was returned to the AHL within a month. With <b>the</b> <b>Hurricanes</b> having changed their minor league affiliate, he joined a new team, the Charlotte Checkers. After recording 30 points (12 goals and 18 assists) over 51 games with the Checkers (10th in team scoring), he was recalled on March 10, 2011. Spending {{the remainder of the}} season with <b>the</b> <b>Hurricanes,</b> he finished 2010–11 with one assist over 23 games, while averaging 10 minutes of ice time. Carolina failed to qualify for the playoffs, coming within three points of the eighth and final seed in the Eastern Conference. With his NHL season over, <b>the</b> <b>Hurricanes</b> returned him to the AHL, where the Checkers had qualified for the 2011 Calder Cup Playoffs. Bowman contributed 8 points (2 goals and 6 assists) over 15 games as the Checkers were eliminated in the Conference Finals by the Binghamton Senators.|$|E
5|$|From their one-yard line, <b>the</b> <b>Hurricanes</b> ran a short rush up the middle, then Kelly {{connected}} on a 28-yard pass {{to tight}} end Mark Cooper {{for a first}} down. Three short rushes by fullback Speedy Neal resulted in 12 yards and a first down. With time running out in the quarter, Kelly attempted and completed a 27-yard pass to wide receiver Rocky Belk, driving <b>the</b> <b>Hurricanes</b> to the Tech 30-yard line and bringing the quarter to an end.

5|$|Storm and <b>the</b> <b>Hurricanes</b> {{received}} the most votes in the first Mersey Beat magazine poll, but many votes were disqualified {{as they had been}} posted from the same {{place at the same time}} and were written in green ink; although never proven, it was thought that Storm had posted the votes. This meant that the Beatles reached the top position, with <b>the</b> <b>Hurricanes</b> coming fourth, even though the Beatles had also been sending in extra votes themselves. Storm was often photographed for the magazine, such as being surrounded by nurses when he left the hospital after breaking a leg during a performance, or playing for the Mersey Beat XI football team.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's second {{bowl game}} {{did not come}} until nearly 20years after its first. On December 10, 1966, the Hokies faced off against the No. 9 Miami Hurricanes in the Liberty Bowl in Memphis, Tennessee.

5|$|The system {{weakened}} into {{a tropical}} storm by October 14 but restrengthened into a Category 1 hurricane by October 16. As <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> began to turn northeastward, it continued to intensify, attaining Category 3 status by October 17. <b>The</b> <b>hurricane</b> continued to approach Havana during the day, and <b>the</b> <b>hurricane's</b> center passed east of Havana during the evening. The following morning, <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> was located over southern Florida moving northeastward, and passed east of the coast of South Carolina. <b>The</b> <b>hurricane</b> began to weaken as it was forced to curve south-southwestward, striking Florida again {{as the result of}} a high-pressure area. The system eventually weakened to a tropical depression over Florida, and traced southwestward into the Gulf of Mexico.

5|$|After {{playing for}} more than 16 hours per week, the group were {{contacted}} by Allan Williams, who wanted {{them to go to}} Hamburg. Derry and the Seniors were successful there, and Williams wanted an additional group. As Storm and the group were committed to Butlins, they turned Williams' offer down (as did Gerry and the Pacemakers) so Williams sent the Beatles to Hamburg instead. After the summer season ended in early October 1960, Storm and <b>the</b> <b>Hurricanes</b> were free to travel to Hamburg, replacing Derry and the Seniors at the Kaiserkeller. They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than the Seniors or the Beatles. They played five or six 90-minute sets every day alternating with The Beatles. Storm and <b>The</b> <b>Hurricanes</b> were later presented with a special certificate by Bruno Koschmider (the owner of the Kaiserkeller) for their performances.|$|E
5|$|The Weather Bureau {{predicted}} Flora {{to turn to}} {{the northwest}} after entering the Windward Passage and affect the Bahamas.

When Flora turned to the northeast out to sea, forecasters again advised Bahamian citizens to prepare for <b>the</b> <b>hurricane,</b> and on October 9, weather advisories advised the southeastern Bahamas to prepare for gale-force winds and strong tides. One advisory considered there to be less than a 50% chance of <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> reaching southeastern Florida, though weather bulletins advised Florida citizens to monitor <b>the</b> <b>hurricane.</b> At its closest approach to Florida, <b>the</b> <b>hurricane</b> remained 330miles (530km) away, though gale warnings were issued from Stuart to Key West due to <b>the</b> <b>hurricane's</b> large size.|$|R

Miami recovered the ball at its 12-yard line, and <b>the</b> <b>Hurricanes</b> began their second possession of the game. Fullback Chris Hobbs and running back Smokey Roan alternated carries, picking up yardage and first downs before entering Virginia Tech territory.
