40|$|Many traffic {{engineering}} problems consist of evaluating {{a number of}} alternate schemes in terms of some measures of performance, such as total travel time, volume to capacity ratio, average speed, <b>total</b> fuel <b>consumption,</b> <b>total</b> emissions, <b>etc.</b> These evaluations generally require prior knowledge of the temporal trip making behaviour of drivers by origin and destination. This thesis presents the development, application, and evaluation of two models capable of inferring these temporal origin- destination (O-D) traffic demands {{on the basis of}} observed link traffic flows and assumptions regarding drivers' route choices. In particular, this thesis presents the development and evaluation of a Least Squared Error (LSE) and a Least Relative Error (LRE) model, each of which is capable of estimating either static demands, a time series of static demands, or dynamic demands. Furthermore, the potential of using probe data, from route guidance system (RGS) equipped vehicles, to enhance these estimated dynamic O-D demands is examined. Both of the LSE and LRE models' mathematical formulations are presented. The LS...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} and balancing {{is one of}} the primary challenges for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) since the tiny sensor nodes cannot be easily recharged once they are deployed. Up to now, many energy efficient routing algorithms or protocols have been proposed with techniques like clustering, data aggregation and location tracking etc. However, many of them aim to minimize parameters like <b>total</b> energy <b>consumption,</b> latency <b>etc.,</b> which cause hotspot nodes and partitioned network due to the overuse of certain nodes. In this paper, a Distance-based Energy Aware Routing (DEAR) algorithm is proposed to ensure energy {{efficiency and}} energy balancing based on theoretical analysis of different energy and traffic models. During the routing process, we consider individual distance as the primary parameter in order to adjust and equalize the energy consumption among involved sensors. The residual energy is also considered as a secondary factor. In this way, all the intermediate nodes will consume their energy at similar rate, which maximizes network lifetime. Simulation results show that the DEAR algorithm can reduce and balance the energy consumption for all sensor nodes so network lifetime is greatly prolonged compared to other routing algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—As an {{important}} branch of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) has received extensive attention of various fields {{as it is}} portable and removeable. However, energy consumption is highlighting increasingly as nodes are hard to be recharged or replaced. Up to now, many energy efficient routing algorithms or protocols have been proposed with techniques like clustering, data aggregation and location tracking etc. However, many of them aim to minimize parameters like <b>total</b> energy <b>consumption,</b> latency <b>etc.</b> In order to optimize network routing and prolong the life of network, this paper proposes an energy-efficient routing algorithm in WBAN {{which is based on}} Genetic Ant Colony Algorithm (GACA). GACA makes full use of Genetic Agorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Algorithm (ACA). Choosing the optimal routing is to take advantages of both GA and ACA. At the early stage of algorithm, it uses GA to generate the initial pheromone distribution quickly and comprehensively, and then converts the evolved pheromones distribution into pheromones that can be used by ACA and finally uses the positive feedback and parallelism of ACA to find out the optimal solution. It is the fusion of the two algorithms, gaining an improvement of both time and quality. Then it reduces and balances energy consumption for all sensor nodes through a Distance-based Energy Aware Routing (DEAR) algorithm in order to prolong the lifetime of network...|$|R

The maximum and minimum values of hazard-related economic damage were calculated as USD 210 and USD 110, respectively, for the sampled households. For the upstream region’s households, the disaster damage equaled to nearly 16 % of yearly <b>total</b> <b>consumption</b> expenditure; while in the downstream region it was 35 % of the yearly <b>total</b> <b>consumption</b> expenditure.
