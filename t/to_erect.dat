5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century several {{attempts}} were made <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> a monument honoring Jennings's public service. On three separate occasions, in 1861, 1869 and 1889, petitions were brought before the Indiana General Assembly <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> a marker for Jennings's grave, but each attempt failed. In 1892 the state legislature finally granted the petition <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> a monument in his honor. Around the same time, after Jennings's unmarked gravesite was independently verified by three witnesses to his burial, his body was exhumed and reinterred at a new site at the Charlestown cemetery.|$|E

5|$|The archaeological {{excavation}} into Borobudur during reconstruction {{suggests that}} adherents of Hinduism or a pre-Indic faith {{had already begun}} <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> a large structure on Borobudur's hill before the site was appropriated by Buddhists.

5|$|The {{culture and}} monuments of ancient Egypt {{have left a}} lasting legacy on the world. The cult of the goddess Isis, for example, became popular in the Roman Empire, as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome.

Early historians such as Herodotus, Strabo, and Diodorus Siculus studied and wrote about the land, which Romans came to view {{as a place of}} mystery.|$|E
5|$|The {{decline in}} the {{erection}} of stelae {{is linked to the}} {{decline in the}} institution of divine kingship, which began in the Late Preclassic. Originally the stelae depicted the king with symbols of power, sometimes standing over defeated enemies and occasionally accompanied by his wives or his heir. By the Terminal Classic, kings were sharing stelae with subordinate lords, who also played a prominent role in the events depicted. This reflected a decentralisation of power and the bargaining between high-ranking nobles so that the king could maintain power, but led to a progressive weakening of the king's rule. As the position of the king became weaker and that of his vassals and subordinates became stronger, the latter began <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> their own stelae, a function that was formerly the exclusive preserve of the king himself. Some of these subordinates broke away to form their own petty states, but even this did not last and they also ceased <b>to</b> <b>erect</b> monuments.|$|E
