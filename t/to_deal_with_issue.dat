40|$|The {{employment}} {{is for all}} the people certain degree of integration into society. It is existential security, certain degree of independence, personal development, social contact and responsibility for them. Therefore even for one with disability {{it is important to have}} a possibility to integrate into the working process and to find the job at labour market. Whereas the last explorations show that the Czech Republic has more than one million people with disability, it is needed <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>issue</b> of their job. The target of the task was to find out which possibilities the people with disability have at labour market in Písek town and to find the answer for research question if they have the interest for this job. The research specimen was formed from five people with mental disability and five people with disability who already have the experience on labour market. The theoretical part is focused on the explanation of some key concepts in this sphere and closer acquaintance with the issue of disabled people employing including legislative of the Czech Republic. It also closer the organisations which deal with employing of disabled people in Písek town. For the investigation it was used qualitative research strategy, method of interrogation data acquisition with the interview technique according to my instruction. The data was processed through interview content analysis. The results showed the disabled people have interest to work. The different reasons head them for this. The reasons are finance, contact with the people and to short long time. The preferences of these reasons are different for the people with mental disable and for the people with disability. As a reason of job hunting for the people with mental disable who are not loaded existential concern is mostly to short long time. On the contrary the most common reason which was stated is finance for the people with disability. The result of the survey is finding that the people with mental disability have mostly only one chance to find the job on protected labour market, whilst the use probability on free and protected labour market is balanced for disabled people. The research results confirmed that the education is one of important assumption to get the job. The people with mental disability are disadvantaged beside disabled people in this regard. Their given layout mostly disallows them to enhance skills and their chance to get the job is lower. During the job finding the disabled people encounter on various complications. The complications relate to kind of their disability, education, insufficient know-how from disabled people and from potential employer and also from still persistent prejudices in relation to disabled people. There are still bigger the possibilities to get the job for disabled people. Due to these persistent circumstances of Labour office and non-profit organisations there are the possibilities to get the job for disabled people constantly higher. The conclusion of the task stated that it is not possible to regard the disabled people as a one homogeneous group. It is necessary to differentiate kind and deep of disability and also individual ability of each person. The problem during the getting work for the disabled people is insufficient know-how about their rights and also low employment awareness about the advantage and disadvantage of disabled people employing...|$|E
