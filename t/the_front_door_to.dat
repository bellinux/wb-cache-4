25|$|The 1940 {{residence}} comprises six {{rooms with}} the former lounge and dining room to the east separated from four former bedrooms to the west by a central hall and lobby running from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the kitchen at the rear. The lounge and dining room share a large double- sided fireplace of face-brick. Two of the former bedrooms retain built-in wardrobes, drawers and shelving. The walls throughout the house and onto the verandahs have a single lining of vertical v-jointed tongue and groove boards with ceilings lined in asbestos cement sheeting and finished with timber cover battens.|$|E
25|$|Information: Preparations {{for seeing}} {{in the new year}} were {{originally}} undertaken to greet the toshigami, or deity of the incoming year. These begin on December 13, when the house was given a thorough cleaning; the date is usually nearer {{the end of the month}} now. The house is then decorated in the traditional fashion: A sacred rope of straw (shimenawa) with dangling white paper strips (shide) is hung over <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> prevent evil spirits from entering and to show the presence of the toshigami. It is also customary to place kadomatsu, an arrangement of tree sprigs, beside the entrance way. A special altar, known as toshidana ("year shelf"), is piled high with kagamimochi (flat, round rice cakes), sake (rice wine), persimmons, and other foods in honor of the toshigami. A fair is traditionally held in late December at shrines, temples or in local neighborhoods. This is in preparation for the new year holidays. Decorations and sundry goods are sold at the fair. Originally these year-end fairs provided opportunities for farmers, fisherfolk and mountain dwellers to exchange goods and buy clothes and other necessities for the coming year.|$|E
500|$|A {{young woman}} {{attending}} {{a party at}} a neighbouring house on Canynge Road {{on the night of}} Yeates' disappearance recalled hearing two loud screams shortly after 9:00pm coming from the direction of Yeates' flat. Another neighbour who lived behind Yeates' home said that he heard a woman's voice scream [...] "Help me", although he could not recall exactly when the incident had occurred. Officers removed <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> Yeates' flat to check for clothing fibres and DNA evidence, with investigators examining the possibility that the perpetrator had entered the flat before Yeates returned home.|$|E

Described in press {{accounts}} as [...] "palatial," [...] the residence is decorated with, among other items, a Jim Dine painting, an Alexander Calder mobile, and a grand piano, and features [...] "twinkling city views" [...] of the New York skyline. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the suite is framed by a golden eagle. It {{is located on}} the opposite side of the corridor from the [...] "royal suite", so-called as it was long used by the Duke of Windsor as his unofficial New York City residence.|$|E
500|$|By late 1977, Bundy's {{impending}} trial {{had become}} a cause célèbre {{in the small town}} of Aspen, and Bundy filed a motion for a change of venue to Denver. [...] On December 23 the Aspen trial judge granted the request—but to Colorado Springs, where juries had historically been hostile to murder suspects. On the night of December 30, with most of the jail staff on Christmas break and nonviolent prisoners on furlough with their families, Bundy piled books and files in his bed, covered them with a blanket to simulate his sleeping body, and climbed into the crawlspace. He broke through the ceiling into the apartment of the chief jailer—who was out for the evening with his wife—changed into street clothes from the jailer's closet, and walked out <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> freedom.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Lennon and Ono {{released}} an 81-minute film {{to accompany the}} Imagine album which featured footage of the couple in their home, garden and the recording studio of their Berkshire property at Tittenhurst Park {{as well as in}} New York City. A full-length documentary rock video, the film's first scene features a shot of Lennon and Ono walking through a thick fog, arriving at their house as the song [...] "Imagine" [...] begins. Above <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> their house is a sign that reads: [...] "This Is Not Here", the title of Ono's then New York art show. The next scene shows Lennon sitting at a white grand piano in a dimly lit, all-white room. Ono gradually walks around opening curtains that allow in light, making the room brighter with the song's progression. At the song's conclusion, Ono sits beside Lennon at the piano, and they share a quaint gaze, then a brief kiss.|$|E

500|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers {{believe that in}} 2009, Dugard's living quarters were in a secondary backyard behind Garrido's house. The private area of the yard included sheds (one of which was soundproofed and used as a recording studio in which Garrido recorded himself singing religious-themed and romantic country songs), two homemade tents, and what {{has been described as}} a camping-style shower and toilet. The area was surrounded by tall trees and a [...] high fence. An entrance to the secondary backyard was covered by trees and a tarpaulin. Privacy was enhanced by tents and outbuildings, and also housed a car that matched the description of the one used in the abduction. Electricity was supplied by extension cords. Law {{enforcement officers}} visited the residence at least twice, but did not ask to inspect the back yard, and did not detect the presence of Dugard or her children in the areas of the property that they did inspect. Witnesses interviewed stated Dugard was seen in the house, and sometimes answered <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> talk to people, but never stated there was a problem or attempted to leave. While the family kept to themselves, the girls were sometimes seen playing in the backyard or as passengers in Garrido's car.|$|E
500|$|The White House is {{also said}} to be visited by three specters who did not live there. The first is that of David Burns, who owned the ground on which the White House stands before selling it to the federal {{government}} in May 1791, and whose spirit has been seen in Oval Office. A reporter told a security guard during the Truman administration that, while standing in the Yellow Oval Room, he heard a faint ghostly voice which said, [...] "I'm Mr. Burns." [...] The second spirit is allegedly that of a British soldier dressed in a uniform from the War of 1812 and carrying a torch. In August 1814, a combined British land and sea force captured Washington, D.C., and set fire to the White House, Treasury Building, Capitol, and other buildings in retaliation for the American looting of York, Upper Canada (now the city of Toronto) and the burning of the Parliament Buildings of Upper Canada after the Battle of York in 1813. The fires were put out only when a hurricane and tornado passed through Washington the following day, extinguishing the blazes. The soldier is claimed {{to be one of those}} who burned the White House, or who lost his life the following day in the storm. Another shade alleged to visit the White House is the ghost of Anna Surratt, daughter of convicted Lincoln assassination co-conspirator Mary Surratt, who forced her way into the White House the night before her mother's execution and unsuccessfully begged for her mother's life. It is claimed by some White House staff that Anna's ghost returns to the White House every July 6, silently banging on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> seek entrance and continue her futile pleas for her mother's life.|$|E
500|$|In July 1916, Dillon was conscripted {{into the}} army, but disliked the {{discipline}} of regimental life. He applied for exemption on the grounds he had to look after his parents and four brothers, but his claim was rejected. In a later failed attempt, he tried to convince army officials {{that he was too}} obese to carry out military duties. [...] On the rare occasions when Dillon was allowed home on leave, he would often indulge in drinking sessions. [...] One night, Lloyd's friend Bella Burge received a knock at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> find a hysterical Lloyd covered in blood and bruises. [...] When asked to explain what had caused her injuries, she stated that she had caught Dillon in bed with another woman and had had a showdown with her husband. By 1917, Dillon's drinking had become worse. That June, two constables were called to Lloyd and Dillon's house in Golders Green after Dillon committed a drunken assault on his wife. [...] Police entered the house and found Lloyd and her maid cowering beneath a table. [...] Dillon confronted the constables and assaulted one of them, which resulted in him being taken to court, fined and sentenced to a month's hard labour. Lloyd began drinking to escape the trauma of her domestic abuse. [...] That year, she was earning £470 per week performing in music halls and making special appearances. By 1918, she had become popular with the British-based American soldiers, but had failed to capture the spirits of their English counterparts, and began feeling sidelined by her peers; Vesta Tilley had led a very successful recruitment drive into the services, and other music hall performers had been honoured by royalty. The following year, she performed perhaps her best known song, [...] "My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)", which was written for her by Fred W. Leigh and Charles Collins. [...] The song depicts a mother fleeing her home to avoid the rent man. [...] The lyrics reflected the hardships of working class life in London {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, and gave her the chance to costume the character in a worn out dress and black straw boater, while carrying a birdcage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{style of}} the Rekord P2 {{followed}} the fashion trends of the time, being less ornate than its predecessor, and in consequence being perceived as [...] "less American looking". <b>The</b> <b>front</b> grille was wider and the tail fins almost completely disappeared, although the embellishment of body creases around the rear lights was curiously elaborate. The panoramic screen was gone which {{made it possible for}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> be wider, facilitating easier entry for the driver and passengers.|$|R
25|$|In February 1960 the ALSI-2-1 {{series was}} released. The Deluxe, {{along with the}} {{commercial}} variants, were updated with quad headlights (the standard model retained the twin headlights). The side strip design was changed on standard models; the V-shape in the side strip was moved from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>doors.</b> On Deluxe models the side strip design remained the same. The standard model gained quad headlights in September 1960 {{with the release of}} the ALSI-2-2 series.|$|R

2500|$|The {{following}} {{stations have}} prepaid fare areas (also called fare control), to allow quick boarding and exiting through {{front and rear}} doors. [...] At all other stations, passengers must stand in line and use <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> pay fares, slowing travel times especially during peak periods. [...] At non fare control stops, an MBTA policy of forcing exiting passengers to also use the front doors (to prevent other riders from entering without paying) causes further congestion and delays.|$|E
2500|$|The {{estate was}} known as Lakeland Farm. Mr. Dole lived there with his wife Julia, his mother-in-law, Mrs. Harriet Coffin, his two daughters, Mary Florence, Harriet (Hattie), and son, Sydney. Dole {{maintained}} the estate for over 30 years, entertaining lavishly. As an example, for his daughter's wedding in 1883 he built a spur line from the Chicago and Northwestern railway tracks almost to his doorstep. A canopied and carpeted walkway extended [...] from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the train enabling the guests {{to walk to the}} mansion for the ceremony and return to the train without concern for the weather. Notable wedding guests included Julian Rumsey (mayor of Chicago and Dole's first cousin) and Levi Leiter (first partner with Marshall Field).|$|E
2500|$|In 1954 the Imperial Custom {{had a new}} grille {{consisting}} of a heavy wraparound horizontal center bar with five ridges on top and integrated circular signal lights. Its front fender nameplate was above a chrome strip, which {{ran the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the front of the door opening. The rear fender stone guard was larger than in 1953, but the rocker panel molding and rear fender chrome strip style were still the same. The back-up lights were now located directly below the taillights, rather than dividing the lights as in the previous year's model. The Imperial Crown shared basic styling with the Imperial Custom. However it had center-opening rear doors and Cadillac-like rear fender taillights. Air conditioning was standard on the Imperial Crown [...]|$|E

The crew built a village and <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> Ra's' temple, as well as a road to access the remote area. The weather was problematic, with [...] winds, rain, and a lack of snow. A shot Wally Pfister had planned to take using a crane had to be done with a {{handheld}} camera.|$|R

2500|$|Eutichio's wife Sinforosa arrives. She is {{ten years}} older than her husband and a jealous woman. Sinforosa is {{immediately}} suspicious that Eutichio has taken the house to start a liaison [...] with the attractive young woman seen living there. Despite his protestations to the contrary, she demands the keys to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> prevent him from letting her imagined rival into the house. That night Annetta manages to escape from her room. She tries to leave the house but finds the front door locked. Eutichio hears the noise and on seeing Annetta thinks she is a ghost. She finally convinces him that she is not a ghost but a real person. As Eutichio touches her hand to verify this, Sinforosa [...] walks in. Her worst suspicions confirmed, she rails at Eutichio for his infidelity.|$|E
2500|$|According to Ojeda's wife, Elma Beatriz Rosado Barbosa, {{as well as}} {{neighbor}} Héctor Reyes, it was the FBI {{agents who}} initiated the shooting at 3:00 pm. The Office of the Inspector General's report stated that an FBI agent detonated a non-lethal [...] "flash bang" [...] grenade outside the house as a diversionary tactic when the FBI approached the house, before any gunfire began, and that Rosado may have thought this explosion was gunfire initiated by the FBI. [...] The FBI press release, however, claims that [...] "as the FBI agents approached {{the front of the}} farm house at approximately 4:28 p.m., [...] Ojeda Ríos opened <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the residence and opened fire on the FBI agents. In response to the gunfire from Ojeda Ríos, the FBI returned fire and established a defensive perimeter in order to contain the environment." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wes Craven {{originally}} {{planned for the}} film {{to have a more}} evocative ending: Nancy kills Krueger by ceasing to believe in him, then awakes to discover that everything that happened in the film was an elongated nightmare. However, New Line leader Robert Shaye demanded a twist ending, in which Krueger disappears and the film all {{appears to have been a}} dream, only for the audience to discover that they are watching a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream, where Fred reappears as a car that [...] "kidnaps" [...] Nancy and her friends, followed by Fred reaching through a window on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> pull Nancy's mother inside. Both a happy ending and a twist ending were filmed, but the final film used the twist ending. As a result, Craven (who never wanted the film to be an ongoing franchise), dropped out of working on the first sequel, [...] (1985). Production wrapped in July, and was rushed to get it ready for its November release.|$|E
