5|$|In Amanita abrupta, as {{with most}} mushrooms, {{the bulk of the}} {{organism}} lies unseen beneath the ground as an aggregation of fungal cells called hyphae; under appropriate environmental conditions, the visible reproductive structure (fruit body) is formed. The cap has a diameter of , and has a broadly convex shape when young, but eventually flattens. The central portion of the cap becomes depressed in mature specimens. The cap surface is verrucose—covered with small angular or pyramidal erect warts (1–2mm tall by 1–2mm wide at the base); the warts are smaller and more numerous near <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> the cap, and small fragments of tissue may be hanging from <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> the cap. The cap surface, the warts, and the flesh are white. The warts can be easily separated from the cap, and in mature specimens they have often completely or partly disappeared. The white gills are placed moderately close together, reaching the stem but not directly attached to it.|$|E
5|$|Pseudoplectania sphagnophila resembles P.nigrella, {{but has a}} {{more deeply}} and {{persistently}} cup-shaped fruit body, a short but distinct stem, and only grows amongst sphagnum moss.

5|$|In two years, a {{very precise}} map, drawn on six sheets at a 1/200,000 scale, was produced. In March 1829, {{a base of}} 3,500 meters had been traced in the Argolis, from one angle at the ruins of Tiryns to an angle of a house in ruins {{in the village of}} Aria. This was {{intended}} to serve as a point of departure in all the triangulation operations for topographic and geodesic readings in the Peloponnese. Pierre Peytier and Puillon-Boblaye proceeded to perform numerous verifications on the base and on the rulers used. <b>The</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> error was thus reduced to 1 meter for every 15 kilometers. The longitude and latitude of the base point at Tiryns were read and checked, so that again <b>the</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> error was reduced as far as possible to an estimated 0.2 seconds. 134 geodesic stations were set up on the peninsula’s mountains, as well as on Aegina, Hydra and Nafplion. Thus, equilateral triangles whose sides measured about 20km were drawn. The angles were measured with theodolites by Gambey.|$|E

The highlight of the Test series came in the final Test when V. V. S. Laxman scored 167 at a run a ball in fading light at the Sydney Cricket Ground and came for much praise from the media. India's ODI series performance matched the Test series in failure as India managed to win just one match against Pakistan and Kapil had to come out in defense of his team.|$|E
