40|$|In a Service-Oriented System (SOS), service requesters specify {{tasks that}} need to be {{executed}} and <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>levels</b> to meet, whereas service providers advertise their services’ capabilities and <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>levels</b> they can reach. Service selectors then match to the relevant tasks, the candidate services that can perform these tasks to the most desirable quality levels. One of the key problems in QoS-aware service selection lies in managing tradeoffs among QoS expectations at runtime, that is, situations in which service requesters specify quality levels that cannot be simultaneously met. We propose a service selection approach that can deal with tradeoffs. The approach consists of: (i) rich QoS models to be used by service requesters when expressing QoS expectations and service providers when describing services’ QoS, and for representing preference and priority relationships between QoS dimensions; and (ii) a multi-criteria decision making technique that uses the models for service selection...|$|E
