50|$|Record restoration, a {{particular}} kind of audio restoration, is the process of converting theanalog signal stored on gramophone records (either 78 rpm shellac, or 45 and 33⅓ rpmvinyl) into digital audio files that can then be edited with computer software and eventually stored on a hard-drive, recorded to digital tape, or burned to a CD or DVD. The process may be divided into several separate steps performed in the following order: 1. Cleaning the record, to prevent unwanted audio artefacts from being introduced in the capture that will necessitate correction in the digital domain (e.g. <b>transient</b> <b>surface</b> noise caused by dirt), and to prevent unnecessary wear and damage to the stylus used in playback.2. Transcription of the record to another format on another medium (generally a digital format such as a wav file on a computer);3. Processing the raw sound file with software in order to remove transient noise resulting from record surface damage (clicks, pops, and crackle cause by surface scratches and wear);4. Using software to adjust the volume and equalization; 5. Processing the audio with digital and analogue techniques to reduce surface/wideband noise; 6. Saving the file in the desired format (WAV, MP3, FLAC, etc.). The source of the information for these steps is available from various websites and the help files for the software employed in the process.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the results of a search for radio {{transients}} between 115 and 190 MHz with the LOw-Frequency ARray (LOFAR). Four fields have been monitored with cadences between 15 minutes and several months. A total of 151 images were obtained, giving a total survey area of 2275 deg^ 2. We analysed our data using standard LOFAR tools and searched for radio transients using the LOFAR Transients Pipeline (TraP). No credible radio transient candidate has been detected; however, we are able to set upper limits on the surface density of radio transient sources at low radio frequencies. We also show that low-frequency radio surveys are more sensitive to steep-spectrum coherent transient sources than GHz radio surveys. We used two new statistical methods to determine the upper limits on the <b>transient</b> <b>surface</b> density. One is free of assumptions on the flux distribution of the sources, while the other assumes a power-law distribution in flux and sets more stringent constraints on the <b>transient</b> <b>surface</b> density. Both of these methods provide better constraints than the approach used in previous works. The best value for the upper limit we can set for the <b>transient</b> <b>surface</b> density, using the method assuming a power-law flux distribution, is 1. 3 · 10 ^- 3 deg^- 2 for transients brighter than 0. 3 Jy with a time-scale of 15 min, at a frequency of 150 MHz. We also calculated for the first time upper limits for the <b>transient</b> <b>surface</b> density for transients of different time-scales.
