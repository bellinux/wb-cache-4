5|$|Military {{camouflage}} {{is part of}} the art {{of military}} deception. The main objective of military camouflage is <b>to</b> <b>deceive</b> the enemy as to the presence, position and intentions of military formations. Camouflage techniques include concealment, disguise, and dummies, applied to troops, vehicles, and positions.|$|E

5|$|Only certain traits may be {{required}} <b>to</b> <b>deceive</b> predators; for example, tests on the sympatry/allopatry border (where the two {{are in the same}} area, and where they are not) of the mimic Lampropeltis elapsoides and the model Micrurus fulvius showed that color proportions in these snakes were important in deceiving predators, but that the order of the colored rings was not.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the overall}} {{umbrella}} of Operation Bodyguard, the Allies conducted several subsidiary operations designed to mislead the Germans {{as to the}} date and location of the Allied landings. Operation Fortitude included Fortitude North, a misinformation campaign using fake radio traffic to lead the Germans into expecting an attack on Norway, and Fortitude South, a major deception involving {{the creation of a}} fictitious First United States Army Group under Lieutenant General George S. Patton, supposedly located in Kent and Sussex. Fortitude South was intended <b>to</b> <b>deceive</b> the Germans into believing that the main attack would take place at Calais. Genuine radio messages from 21st Army Group were first routed to Kent via landline and then broadcast, to give the Germans the impression that most of the Allied troops were stationed there. Patton was stationed in England until 6 July, thus continuing <b>to</b> <b>deceive</b> the Germans into believing a second attack would take place at Calais.|$|E
5|$|Vision is {{the main}} sense of {{orientation}} in humans, and the primary function of camouflage is <b>to</b> <b>deceive</b> the human eye. Camouflage works through concealment (whether by countershading, preventing casting shadows, or disruption of outlines), mimicry, or possibly by dazzle. In modern warfare, some forms of camouflage, for example face paints, also offer concealment from infrared sensors, while CADPAT textiles in addition help to provide concealment from radar.|$|E

On this night a planned raid with moderate numbers of bombers was planned over western Germany. A complex plan of feint attacks and diversions <b>to</b> <b>deceive</b> German air defence system were drawn up. The main force was {{split into two}} separate groups in the Münster area; No. 4 Group RAF were ordered to destroy the synthetic oil plant at Kamen and No. 5 Group RAF would attempt to eliminate the aqueduct, safety gates, and canal boats on the Dortmund–Ems Canal at Ladbergen.|$|E
5|$|Bernard James Tindal Bosanquet (13 October 1877– 12 October 1936) was an English cricketer {{best known}} for inventing the googly, a {{delivery}} designed <b>to</b> <b>deceive</b> the batsman. When bowled, {{it appears to be}} a leg break, but after pitching the ball turns in the opposite direction to that which is expected, behaving as an off break instead. Bosanquet, who played first-class cricket for Middlesex between 1898 and 1919, appeared in seven Test matches for England as an all-rounder. He was chosen as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1905.|$|E
5|$|Dummy {{horses were}} {{sometimes}} used <b>to</b> <b>deceive</b> the enemy into misreading {{the location of}} troops. They were effectively used by Allenby during his campaigns in the east, especially late in the war. Evidence exists that the Germans used horses in their experimentations with chemical and biological warfare. German agents in the US are suspected of infecting cattle and horses bound for France with glanders, a disease which can fatally spread to humans; similar tactics were used by the Germans against the Russians, causing breakdowns {{in their ability to}} move artillery on the Eastern Front.|$|E

5|$|In 1745, Crossford Bridge– which dated back to {{at least}} 1367– was torn down. It {{was one of a}} series of bridges {{crossing}} the River Mersey destroyed by order of the government, to slow the advance of Jacobite forces during the Jacobite rising. The Jacobites repaired the bridge upon reaching Manchester, and used it to send a small force into Sale and Altrincham. Their intention was <b>to</b> <b>deceive</b> the authorities into believing that the Jacobites were heading for Chester. The feint was successful and the main Jacobite army later marched south through Cheadle and Stockport instead.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the actual formation, a phantom 76th Infantry Division was formed for deception. The phantom division {{was part of the}} notional British Fourth Army, to be used for the fictitious Operation Trolleycar. This operation aimed <b>to</b> <b>deceive</b> the Germans into believing that an Allied landing would occur along the northern German coast. While the deception effort was not a complete success, it managed to divert German attention to the northern flank {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Predators may {{identify}} their prey by sound {{as well as}} sight; mimics have accordingly evolved <b>to</b> <b>deceive</b> the hearing of their predators. Bats are nocturnal predators that rely on echolocation to detect their prey. Some potential prey are unpalatable to bats, and produce an ultrasonic aposematic signal, the auditory equivalent of warning coloration. In response to echolocating red bats and big brown bats, tiger moths such as Cycnia tenera produce warning sounds. Bats learn to avoid the harmful moths, but similarly avoid other species such as some pyralid moths that produce such warning sounds as well. Acoustic mimicry complexes, both Batesian and Müllerian, may be widespread in the auditory world.|$|E
5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{was used}} in earnest by the British Admiralty in the First World War. The marine artist Norman Wilkinson led research into dazzle camouflage, resulting in the painting of thousands of British and later American ships in dazzle patterns. He intended it not to make ships invisible, nor even to cause the enemy to miss his shot, but <b>to</b> <b>deceive</b> him into taking up a poor firing position. In the Second World War, dazzle was revisited by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, and applied to a limited extent by other navies.|$|E
5|$|Strategic {{deception}} included increasing {{military activity}} far away, near Moscow. At {{the sites of}} the planned attack, elaborate disinformation was fed to the enemy.

Conversely, along the uninvolved Voronezh Front, bridging equipment and boats were prepared to suggest an offensive there. The five real bridges that were built for the attack were masked by the construction of seventeen false bridges over the River Don.|$|E
