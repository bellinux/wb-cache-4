This is clear, for instance, from <b>the</b> <b>introductory</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Tibrizi, Yahyá ibn Ali (d. 1109 C.E.) to his commentary on the Mu'allaqat. Appended to this he gives a commentary to a poem of Nabigha, to one of A'sha, and moreover one to that poem of 'Abid which, as we have just seen, Ibn Qutaiba had counted among the seven. It is a pure misunderstanding when Ibn Khaldun (1332 - 1406 CE) in his Muqaddimah speaks of nine Mu'allaqat; and we ought hardly to lay any stress on the fact that he mentions not only Nabigha and A'sha, but also 'Alqama ibn 'Abada, as Mu'allaqa poets.

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 69). Today necessity of a Bank as a financial institution is undeniable. A country is financially rich when it has modern financial institutions of its own. These institutions {{play a vital role}} in the field of financial stability of a country. Banking sector is one of the stable financial institutions of a country. Due to Globalization and Technological changes, the banking business has become very competitive now a day. All banks are competing to give effective real time service to their customers. For giving friendly service to the customers they need experienced and well-educated working force. The overall approach of the report is a Descriptive one as it goes into the depth of “Performance Evaluation of Credit Operation Systems of Trust Bank Ltd”. Here both primary and secondary information were used. Interview was the basic techniques comply to collect primary data from any people within the organization. Information about the varieties of activities within the Correspondent Banking Department was collected through interviewed. Among the secondary sources to collect data regarding the company’s performance over the Annual reports of Trust Bank Ltd. Different circulars and papers of Trust Bank Ltd, General Banking Operation manual, Banking Lecture sheet within the organization helped me to gather data about the organization. The principal reason banks are chartered by the government and the central bank is to make loans to their customers. Banks are expected to support their communities with an adequate supply of credit for all legitimate business and consumes financial needs and to price that credit reasonably in the line with competitively determined interest rates. In deed, making loans is the principal economic function of banks to fund consumption and investment spending by businesses, individuals and units of government. How well a bank performs its lending function has a great deal to do with the economic health of fits region, because bank loans support the growth of new businesses and jobs within the banks trade territory and promote economic vitality, Moreover, bank loans often seem to convey positive information to the marketplace about a borrower’s credit quality, enabling a borrower to obtain more and perhaps somewhat cheaper funds from other sources. The report contains seven chapters. The first chapter of the report describes <b>the</b> <b>introductory</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> the internship report in which Introduction of Topic, Origin of the report, Objective of the Report, Scope of the Report, Methodology, and Data Analysis and Organize & Limitations. The second chapter contains the Background of “Trust Bank Ltd. ”, Organization Structure of “Trust Bank Ltd. ”, Vision of “Trust Bank Ltd. ”, and Mission Statement of “Trust Bank Ltd. ” In third chapter, it contains the Theoretical framework. In chapter four, it contains Analysis of Credit Operation of Trust Bank Ltd and chapter five contains Ratio Analysis and Frequency Analysis & Findings. Different Problems, suggestions, recommendations have come at the end of the report. TheProblems findings during the three-month internship period & suggestions are given from observation, comparative analysis, strategic point of view etc. In fine, this paper contains some findings and recommendations, which may be helpful for the Bank. TBL has gained success from the very beginning of their operation and was capable enough to hold the success year after year. It gained success very early because it has a very strong backup to provide it financial support and they are the army welfare trust. The credit portfolio of the bank is a mix of scheme loans, micro credit, marriage loan, car loan, and commercial loans. Commercial loans comprise trade financing in the form of working capital and other funded and non-funded credit facilities. The bank has a classified loans and advances much lower (3 %) than the national average (30 %). The bank as a matter of priority it wants to ensure the quality of its loans portfolio by strengthening post disbursement recovery measures as well as by prioritizing on Early Warning System (EWS) to check the growth of non-performing assets.

5000|$|WILLIAM WILLIAMS TO THE PRINTER AMERICAN MERCURY (HARTFORD, CONN.), FEBRUARY 11, 1788Mr. Babcock,Since {{the federal}} {{constitution}} has had so calm, dispassionate and rational a discussion, and so happy an issue, {{in the late}} worth convention of this state; I did not expect any members of that hon, body to be challenged in a news-paper, and especially by name, and by anonymous writers, on account of their opinion, or decently expressing their sentiments relative to the great subject then under consideration or any part of it. Nor do I yet see the propriety, or happy issue of such a proceeding. However, as a gentleman in your paper, feels uneasy, that every sentiment contained in his publications, (tho’ in general they are well written) is not received with perfect acquiescence and submission.I will endeavour to satisfy him, of the candid reader, by the same channel that I am not so reprehensible as he supposes, in the matter refer’d to. When the clause in the 6th article, which provides that [...] "no religious test should ever be required as a qualification to any office or trust, &c" [...] came under consideration. I observe I should have chose that sentence and any thing relating to a religious test, had been totally omitted rather than stand as it did, but still more wished something of the kind should have been inserted, but with a reverse sense, {{so far as to}} require an explicit acknowledgment of the being of a god, his perfections and his providence, and to have been prefixed to, and stand as, <b>the</b> first <b>introductory</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constitution, in the following or similar terms, viz. We the people of the United States, in a firm belief of the being and perfections of the one living and true god, the creator and supreme governour of the world, in his universal providence and the authority of his laws: that he will require of all moral agents an account of their conduct, that all rightful powers among men are ordained of, and mediately derived from god, therefore in a dependence on his blessing and acknowledgment of his efficient protection in establishing our independence, whereby it is become necessary to agree upon and settle a constitution of federal government for ourselves, and in order to form a more perfect union &c. And instead of none, that no other religious test, should ever be required &c. And that supposing, but not granting, this would be no security at all, that it would make hypocrites &c. Yet this would not be a sufficient reason against it; as it would be a public declaration against, and disapprobation of men, who did not, even with sincerity, make such a profession, and they must be left, to the searcher of hearts: that it would however, be the voice of the great body of the people, and an acknowledgment proper and highly becoming them to express on this and only occasion, and according to the course of providence, one mean of obtaining blessings from the most high. But that since it was not, and so difficult and dubious to get it inserted, I would not wish to make it a capital objection: that I had no more idea of a religious test, denomination of men or Christians, in the long list of diversity, than to regulate their bestowments, by the stature or dress of the candidate; nor did I believe one sensible catholic man in the state wished for such a limitation; and that therefore the news-paper observations, and reasonings (I named no author) against a test, in favour of any one denomination of Christians, and the sacrilegious injunctions of the test laws of England &c. Combated objections which did not exist, and was building up a man of straw and knocking him down again. These are the same and only ideas and sentiments, I endeavoured to communicate on that subject, tho’ perhaps not precisely in the same terms; as I had not written, nor preconceived them, except the proposed test, and whether there is any reason in them of not, I submit to the publik.I freely confess such a test and acknowledgment, would have given me great additional satisfaction: and I conceive the arguments against it, on the score of hypocrisy, would apply with equal force against requiring an oath, from any officer of the united or individual states; and with little abatement, to any oath in any case whatever: but divine and human wisdom, with universal experience, have approved and established them as useful, and a security to mankind.I thought it was my duty to make the observations, in this behalf, which I did, and to bear my testimony for god: and that it was also my duty to say the constitution, with this, and some other faults of another kind, was yet too wise and too necessary to be rejected.p.s. I could not have suspected, the landholder (if I know him) to be the author of the piece refer’d to; but if he or any other, is pleased to reply, without the signature of his proper name, he will receive no further answer or notice from me.Feb. 2d, 1788.|$|R

Besides the Dome of the Rock inscriptions mentioned above, there are also brief Quranic passages on coins issued from the time of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan from the period 697-750.

40|$|Die vorliegende Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit den syntaktischen Besonderheiten des Altrussischen anhand eines untersuchten Abschnittes der Nestorchronik, wobei ein besonderes Augenmerk auf die Verteilung von Parataxe und Hypotaxe gelegt wird. Ein Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, möglichst alle in dem Abschnitt der Nestorchronik vorkommenden Einleitewörter aufzulisten und entsprechend ihrer ursprünglichen, etymologischen Bedeutung zu übersetzen und die sich daraus ergebenden anderen Möglichkeiten der Interpretation der syntaktischen Beziehungen zu beleuchten. Die Arbeit ist in vier Teile gegliedert. Das erste Kapitel beschäftigt sich mit der Herkunft und den verschiedenen Abschriften der Nestorchronik. Das zweite Kapitel behandelt bestimmte Aspekte der Syntax des alten Slavischen. Auffällig im alten Slavischen ist das Fehlen von bestimmten differenzierenden Charakteristika zur Unterscheidung von Parataxe und Hypotaxe, die in anderen indogermanischen Sprachen üblich sind (beispielsweise die Verb-Zweitstellung im Deutschen). Bei Parataxen können die Sätze entweder asyndetisch nebeneinander stehen oder mittels Partikeln verbunden werden. Bei durch Partikel verbundenen parataktischen Satzfolgen wird zwischen kopulativen, adversativen, explikativen und konklusiven Sätzen unterschieden. Nebensätze werden entweder mit Hilfe von Konjunktionen oder Pronomina untergeordnet. Im dritten Kapitel werden die im untersuchten Abschnitt gefundenen Einleitewörter von Nebensätzen aufgelistet, ihre Etymologie wird erläutert und Beispiele aus dem untersuchten Abschnitt werden angeführt. Anhand dieser lassen sich die meisten Einleitewörter in zwei Gruppen gliedern: Sätze mit Einleitewörtern, die von dem indogermanischen Interrogativ- bzw. Indefinitpronominalstamm *quo-/*qui- abgeleitet werden (beispielsweise k(ъ) to, kakъ/kako oder auch kotoryi), lassen sich in rhetorische Fragen umwandeln. Sätze mit Einleitewörtern, die auf den ursprünglichen Demonstrativpronominalstamm zurückzuführen sind (so zum Beispiel jegda, ide(že), pone(že) und jako), können ihrer Etymologie nach in eine Folge von Parataxen umgewandelt werden. Wenn die Konjunktionen ašče und da, welche in keine der beiden Gruppen hineinfallen, anhand ihrer Etymologie übersetzt werden, so bekommt man ebenso Parataxen. Das vierte Kapitel beschäftigt sich mit weiteren syntaktischen Besonderheiten, die im untersuchten Abschnitt gefunden wurden: Constructiones ad sensum, Verdoppelung von Präpositionen, Konstruktionen des Typs togo sja dobьjutь, präpositionsloser Kasusgebrauch und der Dativus absolutus. The {{presented}} thesis {{deals with}} characteristics of Old Slavic using {{a section of}} the Old Slavic Primary Chronicle as a source for analysis and placing particular focus on the distribution of parataxis and hypotaxis. One aim of this thesis is to give as complete a list as possible <b>of</b> all <b>introductory</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> subordinate clauses that are found in the Primary Chronicle and to translate them according to their etymology/derivation. The thesis is structured in four main parts. In order to establish the linguistic framework and background for the subsequent analysis, the first chapter deals with the origin and the different copies of the Primary Chronicle, while the second chapter focuses on relevant syntactic features of Old Slavic. Notable in Old Slavic is the absence of distinctive features for parataxis and hypotaxis, as it is common in other Indo-European languages (e. g. the verb as the second element in German language). In parataxis, sentences can stand asyndetically next to each other, or they can be connected by a particle. In a paratactic order of sentences joined by a particle, distinguishes can be made between copulative, adversative, explicative and resultative sentences. Subordinate clauses are introduced either with conjunctions, or pronouns. The third chapter focuses on the analysis of subordinate clauses in the selected passage of the Primary Chronicle, presenting a comprehensive list <b>of</b> <b>introductory</b> <b>words</b> including their etymological origin. Further examples from the section of the Primary Chronicle are given. On the basis of these examples many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>introductory</b> <b>words</b> can be divided into two groups: sentences with an <b>introductory</b> <b>word</b> which is derived from the Indo-European interrogative/indefinite pronominal radical *quo- /*qui- (such as kъto, kakъ/kako and kotorij) can be transformed into a rhetorical question. Sentences with an <b>introductory</b> <b>word</b> which descend from the original demonstrative pronoun (for example jegda, ide(že), pone(že) and jako) can be transformed according to the etymology into a sequence of parataxis. Only the two conjunctions ašče and da cannot be put into either of these two groups. However, sentences beginnning with either ašče or da can be transformed into a sequence of parataxis if the conjunctions are translated according to their etymological origin. The fourth chapter deals with other syntactic characteristics that were found in the analysed section: constructiones ad sensum, doubling of prepositions, constructions of the type togo sja dobьjutь, using of cases without prepositions, and the Dative absolute...|$|R

The material of this recension is much richer and more comprehensive, since it contains many passages from <b>the</b> Talmud, mnemonic <b>introductory</b> <b>words</b> ("simanim"), <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> the weekly lessons, and, most important of all, legal decisions of the Geonim, usually indicated by the term [...] "shedar" [...] (="he sent"), which are lacking in the earlier redaction.

This was either in Spain or in northern Africa—probably in Kairwan, the center of Talmudic studies at that time. Evidence in favor of Kairwan is supplied by a passage in the Halakhot Gedolot (ed.

5000|$|The {{authority}} of the aforesaid sources may be contested, still, an allusion to those events {{may be seen in}} Il Cel., ii, 141. At any rate in a Bull of Honorius III, Viterbo, 22 Sept., 1220 (Bull. Franc., I, 6), addressed [...] "to the Priors or Custodes of the Friars Minor," [...] one year of novitiate is introduced, in conformity with other orders, after which no one may leave the order (c. ii of the rule of 1221). Furthermore we see in c. xviii of the second rule, that much authority is given to the ministers through the general chapter, which hitherto had been frequented by all the brothers, but now is reserved to the ministers. The second rule was probably published at the General Chapter of Portiuncula, 1221, where for the last time all the friars convened. It was certainly in use in the autumn of the same year, since the Friars in Germany held at Augsburg, Oct., 1221, a provincial chapter in accordance with c. xviii of this rule (See Jordanus, c. xxiii, Analecta Franciscana, i, 9; ed. Böhmer, p. 27). The second rule is called [...] "Regula prima" [...] by all older Franciscan writers, it being the first known in its text, or also [...] "Regula non bullata," [...] for it was never solemnly confirmed by a papal Bull. It has been preserved in many manuscripts and has been often printed, but there are some noteworthy discrepancies of text in chaps. x and xii. The following remarks may be added to characterize it. The rule of 1221 consists of twenty-three chapters, some of which are composed almost entirely of scriptural texts; in others many admonitions are found and towards the end even prayers. <b>The</b> <b>introductory</b> <b>words</b> [...] "Brother Francis [...] [...] [...] promises obedience and reverence to our Lord Pope Innocent" [...] (d. 1216) show clearly that the second rule is only an enlarged version of the primitive one. In chaps. iv and xviii appears an organization, which at the time the first rule was written (1209) could not have existed, since St. Francis had then only twelve companions. Chap. vii, on Working and Serving, is almost certainly of the primitive rule, for its prohibition [...] "not to be chamberlains nor cellarers, nor overseers in the houses of those whom they serve," [...] found scarcely, or only exceptionally, any application in 1221. The Life of Brother Giles (Analecta Francisc., iii, 74 sq., and the introduction of Robinson's [...] "The Golden Sayings of the Blessed Brother Giles," [...] Philadelphia, 1907) may be read as an illustration of this chapter. It may appear strange that neither Thomas of Celano nor St. Bonaventure mentions this second rule, which certainly marked an important stage in the Franciscan Order. The reason thereof may be because it was composed in connexion with troubles arisen within the order, on which they preferred to keep silent.|$|R
