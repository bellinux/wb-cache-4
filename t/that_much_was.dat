25|$|Educated at Taunton School and at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, Irvine played cricket as a {{tail-end}} right-handed batsman and a right-arm leg-spin bowler. In the freshmen's trial {{match at}} Cambridge {{to try out}} new players for the 1926 season, Irvine was the unexpected star: Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>was</b> anticipated from known public school players such as Maurice Turnbull and Bunty Longrigg, but Irvine took eight wickets for just 32 runs in the first innings, and a further three in the second to finish with match figures of 11 for 42. That performance propelled him into the university's first team for {{the first game of}} the season and he retained his place throughout, being awarded his Blue for appearing in the University Match against Oxford University, though he took only one wicket in the match. Earlier in the season, he had taken 10 wickets in each of two consecutive matches, albeit against opposition of doubtful quality. In the match against the Free Foresters, he finished with 11 wickets for 145 runs, and his second innings seven for 79 were the best innings figures of his career. The next game against The Army produced 10 wickets for 101 runs. In the 1926 season as a whole, Irvine took 52 wickets at an average of 19.59 runs per wicket, and headed Cambridge's bowlers both in terms of number of wickets and average.|$|E
500|$|Harding {{had opposed}} payment of a bonus to veterans, arguing in his Senate address <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>was</b> already being done {{for them by}} a {{grateful}} nation, and that the bill would [...] "break down our Treasury, from which so much is later on to be expected." [...] The Senate sent the bonus bill back to committee, but the issue returned when Congress reconvened in December 1921. A bill providing a bonus, without a means of funding it, was passed by both houses in September 1922. Harding vetoed it, and the veto was narrowly sustained. A bonus, not payable in cash, was voted to soldiers despite Coolidge's veto in 1924.|$|E
2500|$|With two {{different}} sets of players competing in performance and two producers with conflicting views on how to approach each song, the sessions were far from disciplined. Years later, when asked about Time Out of Mind, Dickinson replied, [...] "I haven't {{been able to tell}} what's actually happening. I know they were listening to playbacks, I don't know whether they were trying to mix it or not! Twelve musicians playing live—three sets of drums,... it was unbelievable—two pedal steels, I've never even heard two pedal steels played at the same time before! ...

2500|$|The game world {{received}} widespread {{praise from}} critics. Kimberly Wallace of Game Informer called it [...] "immersive", and {{was impressed by}} its attention to detail. Destructoids Chris Carter praised its size, which he found enormous and would take players hours to explore. Jonathon Leack, writing for Game Revolution, praised the game's effective use of its large world. Leack wrote that every region had quests and activities for players to try, although he thought <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>was</b> filler which extended its length. Tom Senior of GamesRadar praised the open world's variety, describing it as an [...] "exciting realization of the Ronin fantasy". GameTrailers' Daniel Bloodworth praised the game for encouraging exploration; many quests would only become available to players after they met non-playable characters {{in different parts of}} the world. Vince Ingenito of IGN and Shaun Prescott of PC Gamer were impressed by the game's scenery and its day-night cycle, with Ingenito saying that it highlighted the game world's authenticity.|$|E
2500|$|For {{several weeks}} after 15 September, the Germans were puzzled about the new weapon, being unable to {{distinguish}} between accurate reports of their shape and size and the more fanciful accounts. The existence {{of male and female}} tanks apparently led Germans to believe that there were a mass of specialist vehicles and sight of a knocked-out tank north of Flers, caused an officer to conclude that it had a single, wide caterpillar track, which caused much confusion to military intelligence. On 28 September, an intelligence officer included the report along with an accurate description and <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>was</b> still uncertain about how the vehicles were built, how many types there were or how big. Bavarian gunners taken prisoner reported that the tanks were a surprise and that the [...] "Spitzgeschoss mit Kern" [...] ( [...] S.m.K. pointed projectile with core) bullets issued earlier had not been intended for anti-tank fire. The tanks that did confront German and Bavarian troops caused panic and prisoners said that it was not war but butchery. Later in the month, a German intelligence officer wrote that only time would tell if the new weapon was of any value.|$|E

60|$|He had judged her quite rightly. The {{manner in}} which the thing had been {{arranged}} had made her very wretched. There had been no love in it;--nothing apparently but assertions on one side <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>was</b> being given, and on the other acknowledgments <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>was</b> to be received. She was aware that in this her father had condemned her husband. She also had condemned him;--and felt, alas, that she also had been condemned. But this little letter took away that sting. She could read in her father's note all the action of his mind. He had known that he was bound to acquit her, and he had done so with one of the old long-valued expressions of his love.|$|E

60|$|He {{backed away}} as he spoke, towards the fireplace, {{and from the}} corner took a stout oaken staff. He was a villain, a thieving rogue. <b>That</b> <b>much</b> <b>was</b> plain.

60|$|I nodded. I {{thought it}} more than {{probable}} that such {{would be the end}} of Karain. It was evident that he had been hunted by his thought along the very limit of human endurance, and very little more pressing was needed to make him swerve over into the form of madness peculiar to his race. The respite he had during the old man's life made the return of the torment unbearable. <b>That</b> <b>much</b> <b>was</b> clear.|$|E

60|$|And his {{conversation}} {{was by no}} means commonplace.

60|$|In the {{following}} Piece I have allowed myself no farther {{deviations from the}} original than were necessary for the fluent reading, and instant understanding, of the Author: so much however is the language altered since Chaucer's time, especially in pronunciation, <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>was</b> to be removed, and its place supplied with as little incongruity as possible. The ancient accent has been retained in a few conjunctions, such as also and alway, from a conviction that such sprinklings of antiquity would be admitted, by persons of taste, to have a graceful accordance with the subject.--W. W. (1820).|$|E
