5|$|During a {{geological}} survey on Surata IV, Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) {{is struck by}} a thorn growing on a motile vine plant. The away team immediately beams back to the Enterprise, where Dr. Katherine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) finds out that the thorn has released a deadly virus into Riker's body. Within a matter of hours, the virus will reach Riker's brain, killing him. To try to save Riker's life, Pulaski puts him into a machine that will artificially stimulate his brain neurons, keeping them active and resisting the virus. This causes Riker <b>to</b> <b>dream</b> <b>of</b> his past adventures aboard the Enterprise. Riker's first dreams are of reasonably neutral occasions, such as {{his first meeting with}} Lieutenant Commander Data (Brent Spiner). He soon moves on to more passionate and even erotic dreams, such as meeting the cheerful young Edo women on Rubicon III, the matriarch Beata (Karen Montgomery) on Angel One, or the computer-generated holodeck woman Minuet (Carolyn McCormick).|$|E

This syndrome has been repeatedly linked to Thailand's Brugada syndrome and to the ingestion of rice. However, no such medical ties have been proven.|$|E

25|$|Léonce Perret {{was born}} in 1880 to Eliès Ferdinand Perret and Marie Collinet. His parents owned a {{woodworking}} shop on Yver Street in Niort, France. Léonce showed a taste for the arts from an early age, in particular for acting and poetry. During his adolescence, Léonce fell seriously ill and {{had to go to}} Paris to see medical specialists. He stayed in the capital for several months while being treated. It was during this brief stay that he began <b>to</b> <b>dream</b> <b>of</b> life as an artist.|$|E

Zuse then pursued civil engineering, graduating in 1935. For a time, {{he worked for the}} Ford Motor Company, using his considerable artistic skills in the design of advertisements. He started work as a design engineer at the Henschel aircraft factory in Schönefeld near Berlin. This required the performance of many routine calculations by hand, which he found mind-numbingly boring, leading him <b>to</b> <b>dream</b> <b>of</b> doing them by machine.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} a play, {{especially}} one's first success, is somewhat like pushing against a door which suddenly opens from the other side. One may fall on one's face or not, but certainly a new room is opened that was always securely shut until then. For myself, the experience was invigorating. It made it possible <b>to</b> <b>dream</b> <b>of</b> daring more and risking more. The audience sat in silence before the unwinding of All My Sons and gasped when they should have, and I tasted that power which is reserved, I imagine, for playwrights, which is to know that by one's invented a mass of strangers has been publicly transfixed.|$|E

25|$|In 1662 the Altan Khan {{attacked}} and {{put to death}} his eastern neighbor. This caused the senior Tushetu Khan to drive him out, but he was restored with Dzungar and Qing support. In 1682 he was captured by the next Dzashgtu Khan and his Khanate disappeared from history. The loss of the westernmost Khalkha Khanate {{opened the way for}} the Dzungars. In 1672 Galdan became Khan of the Dzungars.

25|$|Bournonville {{must have}} had the folk songs Elveskud (The Elf-shot) and Elvehøj (The Elves' Hill) {{in mind when he}} has Junker Ove linger at the hill after lunch with Miss Birthe, his fiancée, only <b>to</b> <b>dream</b> <b>of</b> another - a {{beautiful}} and gentle Hilda, the counter-image of Birthe. It is always at this point - the moment of doubt before a wedding - that the elves appear. For the young man in the folksong Elveskud, the encounter proves fatal. He refuses to dance with the elf girl and her punishment is so harsh that he dies. He is laid in his grave on his wedding day, followed by his fiancée and his mother. In Elvehøj, which is of a later date than Elveskud, it is God who has human fate in his hands. He lets the cock crow at dawn and the young man, who had slept by the hill, wakes from his spell (which turns out to have been a dream) and he counts himself lucky. The manager of the Royal Theatre, J.L. Heiberg - who Bournonville fell out with on numerous occasions during this period because he thought that Heiberg was trying to drive the ballet off the stage - had experienced great success with his Elvehøj, which in Biedermeier style, lets the elves' dance dissolve into dream and delusion.|$|E

500|$|Jagger {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "one of the most popular and influential frontmen in the history of rock & roll" [...] by AllMusic and MSN, with Billboard sharing a similar sentiment calling him [...] "the rock and roll frontman". Musician David Bowie joined many rock bands with blues, folk and soul orientations in his first attempts as a musician in the mid-1960s, and he was to recall: [...] "I used <b>to</b> <b>dream</b> <b>of</b> being their Mick Jagger". Bowie would also offer that [...] "I think Mick Jagger would be astounded and amazed if he realized that to many people he is not a sex symbol, but a mother image." [...] Jagger appeared on Rolling Stone List of 100 Greatest Singers at number 16; in the article, Lenny Kravitz wrote: [...] "I sometimes talk to people who sing perfectly in a technical sense who don't understand Mick Jagger. [...] His sense of pitch and melody is really sophisticated. His vocals are stunning, flawless in their own kind of perfection." [...] This edition also cites Mick Jagger as a key influence on Jack White, Steven Tyler and Iggy Pop.|$|E
500|$|... "Sweet Dreams" [...] was {{acclaimed}} by critics, {{some of whom}} praised {{its dark}} tone and electropop sound {{that is different from}} Knowles' previous work. James Montgomery of MTV News wrote that Knowles' vocals, which he called, [...] "icy and cool, slippery like mercury [...] nothing to scoff at either", help make the song an [...] "undeniable smash" [...] that is unique compared to the work of other artists. Jennifer Vineyard of the same publication argued that the rock elements and smooth vocals contribute to Knowles' [...] "fierce" [...] alter ego, who [...] "dares the listener <b>to</b> <b>dream</b> <b>of</b> her, warning that it might be a 'beautiful nightmare'." [...] Arielle Castillo of Miami New Times noted that [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] is another one of Jim Jonsin's productions with a keyboard-propelled arrangement, but unlike the material Jonsin crafted for Soulja Boy, the song is [...] "swirling, and darker". Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle and Gary Trust of Billboard magazine agreed that the song is one of Knowles' purest dance songs and is [...] "an irresistible call to the dance floor". Describing [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] as a [...] "cool dance track", Dennis Amith of J!-ENT complimented its arrangement, calling it [...] "experimental" [...] with [...] "cool transitions".|$|E
500|$|Conn quickly {{began to}} promote Bowie. The singer's debut single, [...] "Liza Jane", {{credited}} to Davie Jones and the King Bees, had no commercial success. Dissatisfied with the King Bees and their repertoire of Howlin' Wolf and Willie Dixon blues numbers, Bowie quit the band {{less than a}} month later to join the Manish Boys, another blues outfit, who incorporated folk and soul—"I used <b>to</b> <b>dream</b> <b>of</b> being their Mick Jagger", Bowie was to recall. Their cover of Bobby Bland's [...] "I Pity the Fool" [...] was no more successful than [...] "Liza Jane", and Bowie soon moved on again to join the Lower Third, a blues trio strongly influenced by the Who. [...] "You've Got a Habit of Leaving" [...] fared no better, signalling the end of Conn's contract. Declaring that he would exit the pop world [...] "to study mime at Sadler's Wells", Bowie nevertheless remained with the Lower Third. His new manager, Ralph Horton, later instrumental in his transition to solo artist, soon witnessed Bowie's move to yet another group, the Buzz, yielding the singer's fifth unsuccessful single release, [...] "Do Anything You Say". While with the Buzz, Bowie also joined the Riot Squad; their recordings, which included a Bowie number and the Velvet Underground material, went unreleased. Ken Pitt, introduced by Horton, took over as Bowie's manager.|$|E

500|$|... "Ode to Psyche" [...] is a 67-line poem {{written in}} stanzas of varying length, which took its form from {{modification}} Keats {{made to the}} sonnet structure. The ode is written to a Grecian mythological character, displaying a great influence of Classical culture as the poet begins his discourse with [...] "O GODDESS!" [...] (line 1). Psyche, a creature so beautiful that she drew the attention of Cupid himself, draws {{the attention of the}} narrator, whose artistic imagination causes him <b>to</b> <b>dream</b> <b>of</b> her: [...] "Surely I dream'd to-day, or did I see / The wingèd Psyche with awaken'd eyes" [...] (lines 5–6). As he relates himself to the mythical character of Cupid, he confuses the god's emotions with his own and imagines that he too has fallen in love with the woman's beauty. The poet does, however, understand the temporal difference between the characters of ancient Greece and his own as he declares, [...] "even in these days [...] I see, and sing, by my own eyes inspired" [...] (lines 40–43). In line 50, the poet states [...] "Yes, I will be thy priest, and build a fane", which, Harold Bloom suggests, implies that the poet himself becomes a [...] "prophet of the soul" [...] as he regards the beauty of Psyche and attempts to place himself within Cupid's personage. according to T.S. Eliot, it is the most prominent ode among the six great odes.|$|E
