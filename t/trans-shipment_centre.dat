Around the year 1350, a shipping canal, the Rotterdamse Schie was completed, which provided Rotterdam {{access to the}} larger towns in the north, allowing it to become a local <b>trans-shipment</b> <b>centre</b> between the Netherlands, England and Germany, and to urbanize.|$|E

It is an important regional <b>trans-shipment</b> <b>centre,</b> passenger hub and gateway for destinations in Mainland China (with 45 destinations) {{and the rest of}} Asia. The airport is the world's busiest cargo gateway and one of the world's busiest passenger airports. It is also home to one of the world's largest passenger terminal buildings (the largest when opened in 1998).|$|E

40|$|Airports as <b>trans-shipment</b> <b>centres,</b> {{within the}} {{transport}} networks of the world-wide air transport, represent complex knots of huge logistic networks. Cargo handling at airports is significantly {{determined by the}} location, the design and dimensioning of the cargo terminal, {{as well as by}} the internal and external handling relations. The examination and implementation of the modelling und simulation of relevant processes within a realistic part of an air cargo network is the focal point of this article. Its aim is to evaluate and design air cargo processes between two air cargo hubs and their respective origin and destination airports as a whole. It is shown, that the individual approaches to reduce costs of the parties involved, is not as efficient as considering the whole transport network including all external handling relations...|$|R
