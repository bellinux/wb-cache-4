500|$|According to AllMusic {{reviewer}} Kurt Morris, Tell All Your Friends {{is similar}} to the Movielife's <b>This</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Next</b> Year (2000); Taking Back Sunday's [...] "ability ... to sound so blatantly" [...] like the Movielife was [...] "almost their undoing". Morris wrote that the vocals strongly resembled those of the Canterbury Effect, and called Taking Back Sunday [...] "a bit more rockin than the Movielife: [...] "They have cultivated punk, hardcore, emo, and pop and hybridized it better." [...] However, Morris called the album [...] "nowhere near original or creative". Rolling Stones Gil Kaufman wrote that the album [...] "sidesteps many sad-sack emo pitfalls" [...] with [...] "pop-infused hardcore" [...] and [...] "enlightened, dramatic lyrics" [...] describing [...] "heartache that teeter between despondency and dark vengeance". Peter White of Drowned in Sound wrote that the album contained He added that the album featured [...] "Nihilistic, angry pop gems covered in monster riffs" [...] that [...] "screams to rival anything on an Obituary record".|$|E
500|$|The {{debut album}} from the unknown Blunt {{initially}} attracted little critical attention, {{and there were}} no published reviews from major UK music journals. His live performances, mainly in support of better known musicians, received somewhat mixed but generally favourable reviews. His lack of performing experience and inconsistent approach with audiences was commented upon, while his music was likened to that of Damien Rice and David Gray. In March 2004, with Blunt performing in the support role for Katie Melua in Manchester, Alex McCann of Designer Magazine wrote, [...] "Blunt's ascendance is a dead cert and <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>next</b> year it isn't that far removed from reality to suggest that a number one album, Brit Award and countless accolade's [...] will be his for the taking." [...] After release of the album, concert support slots for Elton John and Lloyd Cole and the Commotions in late 2004 and early 2005 followed, as did a band residency at London club 93 Feet East. In March 2005, his second single, [...] "Wisemen," [...] was released.|$|E

Lackluster 3DS sales forced Nintendo to drop its price {{to match the}} DSi XL in the United States on August 12. Japan and Europe had similar price reductions. Gamasutra speculated potential DS buyers in the United States opted for the 3DS as a result; DS sales for August 2011 decreased by 45 percent, while it combined with 3DS sales remained steady compared to the previous month.

The group went on a US fall tour in October and November with support from The Maine and Bad Rabbits. On November 7, a music video {{was released}} for [...] "You Got Me". The video begins with the band wondering about Reyes whereabouts, before shifting to Reyes dancing on an empty stage. The idea for it was proposed by the group's tour manager. Cooper said: [...] "Back before we even started touring, we’d go out to clubs on Long Island together and Eddie [...] would be tearing up the dance floor ... {{is by far the}} best dancer of the band." [...] On March 21, 2012, a music video was released for [...] "This Is All Now". Directed by Greg Hunter and Josh Romero of Dionysian Entertainment, they had shot the footage during the previous summer and created a music video with it. The group was so impressed they selected it as an official video. In April, the band toured Australia with New Found Glory and <b>This</b> <b>Time</b> <b>Next</b> Year.

2500|$|There {{have been}} several plans to produce an American version.

American retailer Interpunk.com held a limited supply of albums available with the CD booklet exclusively signed by the band. Earlier, NME magazine reported that the band had confirmed a small run of club shows in the UK leading up to their main stage performances at the Reading and Leeds festivals in August.

2500|$|Armageddon and its singles have {{received}} a number of positive reviews. Jamie Horne, music journalist for the Border Mail gave the album {{four and a half}} out of five stars, saying, [...] "Armageddon truly is mature pop. But do not fear — it's not adult contemporary and, more importantly, it's nothing like the club pop that's been diseasing our charts. It is late, however, having been penciled in for a mid-year release. But that's also forgiven early with the opening duo, Amnesia and Beg, the latter a swirling mid-tempo effort destined to be a live favourite." [...] Cameron Adams from the Herald Sun wrote, [...] "You've heard Guy's best single to date in Battle Scars; now welcome to his best album. His songwriting has matured as he's left the club behind to focus on the real world. Amnesia and Beg are classy, dramatic adult pop songs that showcase his voice." [...] Adams said [...] "Get Along" [...] was [...] "inspired", and showed new depth from Sebastian. Take 40, said, [...] "Brilliant work Guy! We know {{this is going to be}} a success, and will hopefully give you some ARIA nods <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>next</b> year." [...] They called the title track [...] "Armageddon" [...] an [...] "uplifting anthem", and said [...] "Get Along" [...] showed [...] "the beautiful timbre of his voice, and has a very inspiring message". Jessica Tisdell from music site Novastreamusic wrote, [...] "Sebastian's latest album Armageddon (2012) demonstrates the great growth as an artist that he has achieved over the years of dedication to his career. [...] Armageddon is one of those albums that you just listen to easily and does not have one bad track." [...] She said the lyrics of [...] "Get Along" [...] were [...] "heart-warming and send a great message to humanity" [...] and that [...] "Amnesia" [...] demonstrated [...] "Sebastian's amazing vocal range".|$|E
