5|$|While {{preparing}} for Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) baby shower, her mother, Margaret (Sheila Larken), invites {{a woman named}} Lizzy Gill to help Scully around her apartment. Unbeknownst to Scully, Gill <b>tampers</b> with her pregnancy medications. Meanwhile, Billy Miles (Zachary Aynsley), satisfied with the research conducted at Zeus Genetics in Germantown, kills the head scientist, Dr. Lev, and burns the laboratory. All of the evidence at Zeus Genetics is destroyed, including the viable hybrid fetus. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) informs John Doggett (Robert Patrick) of the fire at Zeus Genetics, and asks to go along to survey the crime scene. Mulder reveals that Dr. Lev is connected to Scully's former obstetrician, Dr. Parenti. While searching Dr. Parenti's office, the agents find another storage room containing hybrid fetuses. They confront Dr. Parenti, who denies everything.|$|E
5|$|During a {{time when}} they are both {{particularly}} vulnerable, Dimitri and Edmund's wife, Maria, sleep together. When Maria finds out she is pregnant, they have a DNA test done. Skye Chandler, who is in love with Edmund, <b>tampers</b> with test so it will show Dimitri is the father when it is in fact Edmund. After Maria confesses everything, a devastated Edmund tells Dimitri that he is dead to him and he will be bringing the child up as his own. Maria gives birth to a baby girl named Maddie and is later presumed dead in a plane crash. Dimitri discovers that Edmund is Maddie's father when he finds out their blood types do not match. He takes her to Vadzel, but Edmund tracks them down and takes back custody of Maddie. The brothers remain estranged for quite some time, but eventually manage to reconcile. Dimitri leaves Pine Valley permanently in 2001 with his current wife, Alex Devane.|$|E

Nollette admits to stealing Grable's work and prepares to shoot Roland, but is distracted by some equations. Roland strikes him with a computer keyboard and drags him into the wind tunnel. The agents arrive in time to convince Roland not to kill Nollette. At the same time, the rising temperatures in the storage unit kill Grable. Roland is removed from the care home, to be taken to a psychiatric institute for testing. However, as he leaves he stops to comb his hair in a style reminiscent of his brother, raising the question of whether he is actually free of Grable's control.|$|E

Rae considers having an abortion but ultimately decides against it. After catching Brendan and Ste kissing, Rae resolves to raise the baby alone, but suffers a miscarriage after a vicious row with Brendan.

Declan finds out and asks Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney) to help him. Toadie tells Declan that Paul has embezzled money from Lassiter's Hotel and Declan tells Diana Marshall (Jane Badler). Diana comes to Erinsborough and Declan tells her {{he made a mistake}} to protect Rebecca. Diana does not believe him and she finds the evidence of Paul's embezzlement. Paul asks Declan to take his place as manager of Lassiter's for six months and Declan and Diana team up to bring Paul down. Declan neglects Kate and she ends their relationship. He later kisses Candace Carey, which Kate witnesses. Paul discovers Diana and Declan's plan and threatens Declan. Paul is later pushed from the mezzanine of Lassiter's Hotel. Declan is questioned by Detective Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) over the accident. Declan and Kate sleep together, but Kate tells him that it was a mistake. Declan encourages Rebecca to divorce Paul, but she tells him that Paul knows everything. Declan tells her that they need to leave. When Kate finds them packing, Declan tells her that he pushed Paul. However, he is covering for his mother.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{ablative}} {{process takes}} place on both walls of the radiation channel, a numerical estimate made with ISRINEX (a thermonuclear explosion simulation program) suggested that the uranium tamper also had a thickness of 2.5cm, so that an equal pressure would be applied to both walls of the hohlraum. The rocket effect {{on the surface of}} tamper's wall created by the ablation of its several superficial layers would force an equal mass of uranium that rested in the remainder of the tamper to speed inwards, thus imploding the core. At the same time, the rocket effect {{on the surface of the}} hohlraum would force the radiation case to speed outwards. The ballistic case would confine the exploding radiation case for as long as necessary. The fact that the tamper material was uranium enriched in U was deduced based on the final fission reaction fragments detected in the radiochemical analysis, conclusively shown by the U found by the Japanese in the shot debris. The first-generation thermonuclear weapons (MK-14, 16, 17, 21, 22 and 24) all used uranium <b>tampers</b> enriched to 37.5% U. The exception to this was the MK-15 ZOMBIE that used a 93.5% enriched fission jacket.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A non-malleable code protects {{messages}} against various {{classes of}} <b>tampering.</b> Informally, a code is non-malleable if the message {{contained in a}} <b>tampered</b> codeword is either the original message, or a completely unrelated one.

25|$|In {{response}} to the public alarm over fallout, an {{effort was made to}} design a clean multi-megaton weapon, relying almost entirely on fusion. The energy produced by the fissioning of unenriched natural uranium, when used as the tamper material in the secondary and subsequent stages in the Teller-Ulam design, can evidently dwarf the fusion yield output, {{as was the case in}} the Castle Bravo test; realizing that a non-fissionable tamper material is an essential requirement in a 'clean' bomb, it is clear that in such a bomb there will be a relatively massive amount of material that does not contribute energy by either fission or fusion. So for a given weight, 'dirty' weapons with fissionable <b>tampers</b> are much more powerful than a 'clean' weapon (or, for an equal yield, they are much lighter). The earliest known incidence of a three-stage device being tested, with the third stage, called the tertiary, being ignited by the secondary, was May 27, 1956 in the Bassoon device. This device was tested in the Zuni shot of Operation Redwing. This shot used non fissionable tampers; an inert substitute material such as tungsten or lead was used. Its yield was 3.5 megatons, 85% fusion and only 15% fission.|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in software protection {{is the problem}} of <b>tampering</b> where an adversary modifies a program and uses {{it in a way that}} was not intended or desired. Several ad hoc techniques for software <b>tamper</b> resistance have been proposed, some of which provide a significant level of resilience against <b>tampering.</b> However, the literature lacks a formal definition of <b>tampering</b> that takes into account a model of the attacker’s goals. One effect of this lack is the inability of easily comparing the actual efficacy of proposed <b>tamper</b> resistance mechanisms and evaluating the practical limits of <b>tamper</b> resistance. This paper is a step towards addressing this shortcoming. We consider the two players: the defender who wishes to protect the program, and an adversary who wishes to modify the program as well as the assets embedded within the program to his advantage. We propose a way of expressing the intent of the defender and the attacker based on predicates defined over program traces. Based on these expressions, we present formal definitions for software <b>tamper</b> resistance, and software <b>tamper</b> verification. With a practical <b>tamper</b> verification scheme, we show how this formal model can be used in a reactive protection setting. ...|$|R
