5|$|At {{the north}} (Manhattan- and Queens-bound) {{end of the}} upper level, the Culver Line local tracks diverge, {{splitting}} into four tracks. The F train, using the outer pair of tracks, ramps down to <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level,</b> merges with the innermost, express tracks located on <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level,</b> and continues north to Jay Street–MetroTech. Meanwhile, the G train, using the inner pair of tracks, stays on the upper level before making a hard right turn east under Schermerhorn Street to Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets. <b>The</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> tracks can only be reached by trains running to or from Jay Street–MetroTech since they do not connect to the IND Crosstown Line.|$|E

5|$|Route 139 is {{essentially}} three distinct, but connected highways: the upper level, <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level,</b> and the Holland Tunnel approach (the Interstate78 concurrency).

5|$|The {{upper level}} {{contains}} {{a mix of}} seating options. At one end are eight tables, four to each side, each seating four passengers. In the center is a lounge area with a wet bar and several groups of seats. The stairs to <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> are located here as well. At the other end are swivel chairs. <b>The</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> contains a bathroom, additional tables, and a snack bar. As built, the lounges had seating for 73. The cars were built with an electric piano in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level,</b> which has since been removed.|$|E
5|$|From 1944 to 1979, the {{configuration}} of Readville was static: the two-story depot served <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> (Northeast Corridor) tracks, while the elevated track to Franklin and beyond was served by a small shack with stairs to <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level.</b> Starting in 1979, construction of the Southwest Corridor necessitated closure of the main line between Back Bay and Forest Hills. From November 3, 1979 until October 5, 1987, all Franklin Line and Providence/Stoughton Line service ran to Boston on the Midland Division via Readville.|$|E

5|$|The {{configuration}} of the relay tracks is evidence of the original plans to build {{an extension of the}} Queens Boulevard Line further east into Queens. The line would have continued under Hillside Avenue to Springfield Boulevard and Braddock Avenue (both formerly Rocky Hill Road) in Queens Village, with later plans to extend the line to Little Neck Parkway in Bellerose near the Nassau County border. The upper level was to be extended eastward while <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> tracks were always intended to be relay tracks. The tracks on the upper level are longer than <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> tracks and the upper level tracks have a wooden partition at the bumper blocks.|$|E
5|$|Bergen Street was {{originally}} designed as an express station, {{but only the}} upper level is currently in service; <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> is neither in regular service nor usable due to its deteriorated condition. <b>The</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> of the station was used when express service was provided on the Culver Line between 1968 and 1976. Express service was eliminated due {{to the loss of}} direct local service along the line to Manhattan. The express platforms were permanently removed from service during the 1990s, and due to a fire in 1999 the relay room was damaged, making the express tracks unusable. The relay room was rebuilt in 2008, and after repairs were done on the line, the implementation of express service become feasible. In 2016, it was announced that the MTA was considering having express service brought back to the line. However, unlike the earlier express service, express trains will skip this station due to the high cost of rebuilding it, thus making the station a local stop.|$|E
5|$|East of {{this station}} on the IND side are {{turnouts}} for a connection to Phase 3 of the Second Avenue Subway, clearly visible from a moving train, which would allow future service from Queens towards Midtown and Downtown Manhattan. Also to the east, the eastbound track of the IND line rises to the upper level of the tunnel, as both IND tracks are located on the upper level of 63rd Street Tunnel for the trip under the East River. The two tracks on <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> of that tunnel are being connected to the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) via the East Side Access project. The project will bring trains from the LIRR's Main Line to Grand Central Terminal, but, as of December 2016, <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> is currently unused.|$|E

5|$|Formally, the Culver Line ends as {{the track}} curve enters <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> of the double-decked station along the BMT Brighton Line's right-of-way, and the {{chaining}} track designation changes from IND tracks B1 and B2 to BMT tracks A1 and A2 of the Brighton Line. However, {{there is no}} longer a connection to the Brighton Line at this point, and for all practical purposes the Culver Line continues into tracks 5 and 6 of the Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue Terminal.|$|E

50|$|Perceptual {{control theory}} {{currently}} proposes {{a hierarchy of}} 11 levels of perceptions controlled by systems in the human mind and neural architecture. These are: intensity, sensation, configuration, transition, event, relationship, category, sequence, program, principle, and system concept. Diverse perceptual signals at a <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> (e.g. visual perceptions of intensities) are combined in an input function to construct a single perception at the higher level (e.g. visual perception of a color sensation). The perceptions that are constructed and controlled at <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> are passed along as the perceptual inputs at the higher levels. The higher levels in turn control by telling <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>levels</b> what to perceive: that is, they adjust the reference <b>levels</b> (goals) of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>levels.</b>|$|R

5|$|Bergen Street is {{laid out}} similar to other subway {{stations}} located below narrow streets, with two levels. The upper level—the only one used in regular service—serves local trains, while <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>level</b> has formerly seen express service. As {{a result of the}} station's proximity to ground level, {{there is no room for}} a mezzanine, making it one of only three as-built express stations in the system that do not allow free transfers between directions. As a result passengers wishing to transfer from a Brooklyn-bound G to a Manhattan-bound F, and vice versa, cannot do so at this station.|$|E
