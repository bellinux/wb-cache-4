5|$|The {{birth control}} {{movement}} received an unexpected boost during World War I, {{as a result}} of a crisis the U.S. military experienced when many of its soldiers were diagnosed with syphilis or gonorrhea. The military undertook an extensive education campaign, focusing on abstinence, but also offering some contraceptive guidance.Tone, pp. 91–115 contains a history of contraception in the U.S. military in World War I. Navy secretary Josephus Daniels led the efforts to enforce abstinence. The military, under pressure from purity advocates, did not distribute condoms, or even endorse their use, making the U.S. the only military force in World War I that did not supply condoms to its troops. When U.S. soldiers were in Europe, they found rubber condoms readily available, and when they returned to America, they continued <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>condoms</b> as their preferred method of birth control.|$|E

Also, the possibility of using implementation intentions as a means to create a cognitive link between the critical situation and the goal <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a <b>condom</b> was investigated in a sample of sexually active people (Study 2 & 3). Results revealed that implementation intentions targeting a personally selected behavior related <b>to</b> <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> did not promote <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> (Study 1), most likely because the goal <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a <b>condom</b> is temporarily abandoned in situations where <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> is actually required (Study 2). However, implementation intentions directly targeting the goal <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a <b>condom</b> were shown to increase the accessibility of this goal when the intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a <b>condom</b> was strong (Study 3). This finding suggests that implementation intentions could be effective in promoting <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> by increasing accessibility of the goal <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a <b>condom</b> in situ.

40|$|SUMMARY AIM: Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) {{are common}} among college students. Evidence suggests {{there may be}} increasing trend in females. This study assesses the differences in attitude <b>to</b> <b>use</b> of <b>condom</b> <b>to</b> determine the risk of infections among students. METHOD: A total of 880 students from College of Education Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria were assessed for attitude <b>to</b> the <b>use</b> of <b>condom</b> and relative risk of STIs, using the Sexual Risk Questionnaire. RESULTS: The mean age for males was 22. 4 &# 177; 4. 7 years and females 21. 9 &# 177; 5. 5 years. There were variable attitudes <b>to</b> the <b>use</b> of <b>condom</b> among students; 24. 2 % males and 21. 9 % females were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> unsafe sex with 1. 105 (RR) of STIs at 95 % CI; 34. 7 % against 27. 4 % who were of the same HIV status had 1. 179 (RR) at 95 % CI; while 44. 7 % against 37. 9 % {{who claimed to be}} enjoying sex without condom had 1. 132 (RR).

While still believing that contraceptive devices interfere with the creation of life, the Pope stated that in that particular case, it can be a responsible act to raise awareness of the nature of such an act, and as a benefit, to avoid death and save life, though only as a first step, not a truly moral solution, before convincing the male prostitute of a truly moral solution, which means ceasing prostitution and sexual activity outside of marriage. There was some confusion at first whether the statement applied only to homosexual prostitutes and thus not to heterosexual intercourse at all. However, Federico Lombardi, spokesman of the Vatican, clarified that it applied to heterosexual and transsexual prostitutes, both male and female, as well. He also clarified that, in the interview, the Pope did not reverse the Church's centuries-old prohibition on contraceptive use in the context of heterosexual sexual acts, which the Church states must normally be open to the transmission of life, and that he did not reverse his positions on homosexual acts and prostitution either.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background HIV/AIDS is {{the most}} {{dramatic}} epidemic of the century that has claimed over two decade more than 3 million deaths. Sub Saharan Africa is heavily affected and accounts for nearly 70 % of all cases. Despite awareness campaigns, prevention measures and more recently promotion of anti viral regimens, the prevalence of cases and deaths is still rising and the prevalence of systematic <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> remains low, especially in rural areas. This study identifies barriers <b>to</b> <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) in Benin, West Africa. Methods The study was a cross-sectional survey conducted from June to July 2002. Two hundred fifty one (251) individuals were interviewed using a structured questionnaire adapted from a standardized WHO/GAP questionnaire. A logistic regression was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> identify factors associated with <b>condom</b> <b>use.</b> Results In spite of satisfactory knowledge on HIV/AIDS transmission, participants are still {{at high risk of}} contracting the infection. Sixty three (63) percents of the interviewees reported being able to recognize infected people, and <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> during the last occasional intercourse was declared by only 36. 8 % of males and 47. 5 % of females. Based on the HBM, failure <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>condom</b> was related <b>to</b> its perceived lack of efficacy [OR = 9. 76 (3. 71 – 30. 0) ] and perceived quality [OR = 3. 61 (1. 31 – 9. 91) ]. Conclusions This study identifies perceived efficacy (incomplete protective effect) and perceived utilization-related problem (any reported problem <b>using</b> <b>condoms)</b> as the main barriers <b>to</b> <b>condom</b> <b>use.</b> Hence, preventions strategies based on increasing perceived risk, perceived severity or adequate knowledge about HIV/AIDS may not be sufficient <b>to</b> induce <b>condom</b> <b>use.</b> These data will be useful in designing and improving HIV/AIDS prevention outreach programs in Sub Saharan Africa. </p...|$|R
