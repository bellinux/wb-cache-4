25|$|Imperforate {{lacrimal}} punctum is a congenital {{disorder of}} dogs involving {{the lack of}} an opening to the nasolacrimal duct (<b>tear</b> <b>duct)</b> in the conjunctiva.|$|E
25|$|Treatments include {{artificial}} tears, prescription {{tears and}} punctal occlusion. Punctal occlusion {{is accomplished by}} placing a collagen or silicone plug in the <b>tear</b> <b>duct,</b> which normally drains fluid from the eye. Some patients complain of ongoing dry eye symptoms despite such treatments and dry eye symptoms may be permanent.|$|E
2500|$|Other abnormalities, {{affecting}} the scalp, head, face, jaw and teeth {{may be found}} with JBS. These include: ectodermal mid-line scalp defects with sparse, oddly-patterned hair growth; aplasia cutis [...] (underdeveloped, very thin skin) over the head, an enlarged fontanelle ("soft spot" [...] {{on the head of}} young infants), microcephaly (undersized skull), prominent forehead, absence of eyebrows and eyelashes, mongoloidal eye shape, nasolacrimo-cutaneous fistulae (this refers to the formation of an abnormal secondary passageway from either the <b>tear</b> <b>duct</b> or lacrimal sac to the facial skin surface, possibly discharging fluid), flattened ears, micrognathism of the maxilla and mandible (underdevelopment of the upper and lower jaw, respectively), with the maxilla more prominently affected in some cases; congenital clefting of bones surrounding the optical orbit (eye socket), such as the frontal and lacrimal bone; and maldeveloped deciduous teeth ("baby teeth"), with an absence of permanent teeth.|$|E
50|$|Blocked <b>tear</b> <b>ducts.</b>|$|R
50|$|In each eye, {{there are}} two puncta — little {{openings}} that drain tears into the <b>tear</b> <b>ducts.</b> There are methods to partially or completely close the <b>tear</b> <b>ducts.</b> This blocks the flow of tears into the nose, and thus more tears are available to the eyes. Drainage into either one or both puncta in each eye can be blocked.|$|R

50|$|If it is {{determined}} that the cause {{is due to a}} blocked <b>tear</b> <b>duct,</b> a gentle palpation between the eye and the nasal cavity may be used to clear the <b>tear</b> <b>duct.</b> If the <b>tear</b> <b>duct</b> is not cleared by the time the newborn is one year old, surgery may be required.|$|E
50|$|A punctal plug, {{also known}} as <b>tear</b> <b>duct</b> plug or {{lacrimal}} plug, is a small medical device that is inserted into the <b>tear</b> <b>duct</b> (puncta) of an eye to block the duct. This prevents the drainage of liquid from the eye. They are used to treat dry eye.|$|E
50|$|A punctal plug may be {{inserted}} into the <b>tear</b> <b>duct</b> by an optometrist or ophthalmologist, decreasing the removal of natural tears from the affected eye.|$|E
50|$|In humans, the <b>tear</b> <b>ducts</b> {{in males}} {{tend to be}} larger than the ones in females.|$|R

50|$|Epiphora, or {{watering}} eyes, is {{a condition}} in which tears flow out of the eyes, bypassing the lacrimal puncta. It is primarily caused by excessive tear production (as a result of emotion, irritation or dryness) or blockage of the drainage system. Such a blockage is a common problem among elderly people, as the <b>tear</b> <b>ducts</b> can narrow or get blocked easily. The same condition is also present in newborn babies, as their <b>tear</b> <b>ducts</b> don’t open until some time after birth.|$|R
50|$|Canaliculodacryocystostomy is a {{surgical}} correction for a congenitally blocked <b>tear</b> <b>duct</b> {{in which the}} closed segment is excised and the open end is joined to the lacrimal sac.|$|E
50|$|Oculoplastic {{surgeons}} perform procedures such as {{the repair}} of droopy eyelids (blepharoplasty), repair of <b>tear</b> <b>duct</b> obstructions, orbital fracture repairs, removal of tumors {{in and around the}} eyes, eyelid reconstruction.|$|E
50|$|Blinking {{provides}} moisture {{to the eye}} by irrigation using {{tears and}} a lubricant the eyes secrete. The eyelid provides suction across the eye from the <b>tear</b> <b>duct</b> to the entire eyeball {{to keep it from}} drying out.|$|E
50|$|On 8 July 2010, the French media {{reported}} that a full face transplant, including <b>tear</b> <b>ducts</b> and eyelids, was carried out at the Henri-Mondor hospital in Créteil.|$|R
50|$|Some {{theories}} suggest mammalian <b>tear</b> <b>ducts</b> {{and sweat}} glands may be evolutionarily related to salt glands. While human tears {{are high in}} potassium, most phylogeneticists disagree with the association.|$|R
50|$|In infants, the <b>tear</b> <b>ducts</b> (that {{drain the}} tears) {{occasionally}} fail to open, {{resulting in the}} overflow of tears onto the cheeks (epiphora) and rheum deposition on the surrounding skin.|$|R
50|$|If punctal plugs are effective, thermal or {{electric}} cauterization of puncti can be performed. In thermal cauterization, a local anesthetic is used, {{and then a}} hot wire is applied. This shrinks the drainage area tissues and causes scarring, which closes the <b>tear</b> <b>duct.</b>|$|E
50|$|Runny {{eyes and}} other conjunctival {{problems}} {{can be caused by}} dental disease or a blockage of the <b>tear</b> <b>duct.</b> Environmental pollution, corneal disease, entropion, distichiasis, or inflammation of the eyes are also causes. This is easy to diagnose as well as treat.|$|E
50|$|Treatments include {{artificial}} tears, prescription {{tears and}} punctal occlusion. Punctal occlusion {{is accomplished by}} placing a collagen or silicone plug in the <b>tear</b> <b>duct,</b> which normally drains fluid from the eye.

50|$|Oculoplastics, or oculoplastic surgery, {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of surgical procedures that deal with the orbit (eye socket), eyelids, <b>tear</b> <b>ducts,</b> and the face. It also deals with the reconstruction of the eye and associated structures.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{definitive}} host, Thelazia {{have been found}} in various tissues of the orbit (or socket) of the eye, including within the eyelids, in the <b>tear</b> glands, <b>tear</b> <b>ducts,</b> or the so-called [...] "third eyelid" [...] (nictitating membrane) or in the eyeball itself.|$|R
5000|$|Other related {{conditions}} on the eyelids include chalazion ( [...] a granulomatous reaction to sebaceous glands on the eyelid), lacrimal duct cysts (cysts related to <b>tear</b> <b>ducts)</b> and nasolacrimal duct cysts (the nasolacrimal <b>duct</b> drains <b>tears</b> into the nose via a punctum on the lower eyelid).|$|R
5000|$|Neurologist Walter Freeman used medical {{instruments}} called leucotomes, {{and later}} orbitoclasts, {{both of which}} were essentially ice picks, to perform transorbital lobotomies. This operation was informally called [...] "ice pick lobotomy": the leucotome was hammered into the patient's brain with a rubber mallet via the eye's <b>tear</b> <b>duct.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tears are {{produced}} by the lacrimal gland, situated just outside the eye. Blinking the eyelids distributes the tears to keep the eyes moist, clean and lubricated. Excess tears are drained via the punctum through the tiny channels called canaliculi located {{on the inner side}} of the eyes into the tear sac, from there to the <b>tear</b> <b>duct,</b> the nose and finally down the throat.|$|E
50|$|Leela and the Doctor {{decide on}} a last-ditch strategy. They create clones of themselves, which can only survive for ten minutes due to {{problems}} with the technique. The clones will then be shrunk and inserted into the Doctor. There they will destroy the Nucleus and escape through a <b>tear</b> <b>duct.</b> In the meantime, Leela and K-9 fight off the infected staff of the hospital.|$|E

5|$|Many of Bond's adversaries are characterised by {{an unusual}} {{physical}} deformity; for example, Le Chiffre suffered haemolacria, causing his <b>tear</b> <b>ducts</b> to weep blood. Not {{all of the}} villains have unusual physical traits; Mathieu Amalric's Dominic Greene was depicted without such characteristics, instead being inspired by Tony Blair and Nicolas Sarkozy.|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} flat-faced animals, the Exotic's <b>tear</b> <b>ducts</b> {{are prone to}} {{overflowing}} due to the nasolacrimal duct, which can dampen and stain the face.

50|$|The {{music video}} is {{reminiscent}} of such sci-fi films as Fantastic Voyage; it depicts Brian Molko {{and the other members}} of the band in an undisclosed, scientific headquarters where Molko is shrunk down to microbiological proportions and accidentally dropped into the mouth of drummer Steve Hewitt. The music video in its entirety maintains a sci-fi aesthetic throughout. The video ends with a shrunken Molko being sucked out through Hewitts's <b>tear</b> <b>duct.</b>|$|E
50|$|Skunks as Pets Canada leader Vivianne Chernoff {{and other}} activists {{subsequently}} persuaded the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to legalize importation of pen-bred skunks. Although NRC {{does not recognize}} the CFIA laws, the CFIA assured Chernoff that NRC cannot confiscate a micro-chipped skunk whose legality is documented with import papers and a health certificate. In 2004, Canadian activists were working on having a <b>tear</b> <b>duct</b> rabies test legalized for skunks.|$|E
2500|$|Epistaxis, or nosebleed, is {{a special}} case, where almost all first aid {{providers}} train the use of pressure points.
