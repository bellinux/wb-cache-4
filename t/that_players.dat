5|$|Opinions on the game's mid-level {{checkpoint}} {{system were}} mixed. Matt Cullen of Canadian Online Gaming {{noted that the}} checkpoints meant <b>that</b> <b>players</b> were not sent too far back into the level after each death, saving time. Official Xbox Magazine's Taylor Cocke, however, noted that the checkpoints save players' point progress, meaning <b>that</b> <b>players</b> would have to start the level over if their performance wasn't good enough before they reached the checkpoint.|$|E
5|$|Soul Rangers, {{players who}} have failed to become Harbingers, are {{described}} as miserable, skeletal scavengers, the scourge of The Other Side. Soul Rangers hunt down other players and steal their keystones. Soul Rangers were created during the game's development. Brett Clements wanted to introduce characters <b>that</b> <b>players</b> {{did not want to}} become, but he later found <b>that</b> <b>players</b> enjoyed the anarchic role of the Soul Ranger. The final character in the game is the Gatekeeper, whose job is to make sure the other characters cannot escape from The Other Side to the real world. The Gatekeeper's character is based on the old cemetery gatekeepers, whose job was to guard cemeteries from grave robbers.|$|E

50|$|Forward {{induction}} is {{so called}} because just as backward induction assumes future play will be rational, forward induction assumes past play was rational. Where a player {{does not know}} what type another player is (i.e. there is imperfect and asymmetric information), <b>that</b> <b>player</b> may form a belief of what type <b>that</b> <b>player</b> is by observing <b>that</b> <b>player's</b> past actions. Hence the belief formed by <b>that</b> <b>player</b> of what the probability of the opponent being a certain type is based on the past play of that opponent being rational. A player may elect to signal his type through his actions.|$|R
5|$|A year later, an add-on called The Soul Rangers was {{released}}. The add-on allows {{players to}} play only as The Soul Rangers and is hosted by a Soul Ranger calling himself Dr. Mastiff. The add-on was released because the creators found out <b>that</b> <b>players</b> enjoy causing damage as The Soul Rangers.|$|E
5|$|Before the game's release, {{industry}} analyst Michael Pachter estimated that Halo Wars would sell 2 million units. On March 19, 2009, Microsoft {{announced that the}} game had sold 1 million units and <b>that</b> <b>players</b> had spent 118 total years of time in online skirmish matches. According to NPD Group's March sales figures, Halo Wars sold 639,000 copies in the U.S. through March, making it the third best-selling game in the market.|$|E
5|$|Blind cricket, {{which is}} played {{basically}} the same as conventional cricket but using larger stumps and wickets and a white ball so <b>that</b> <b>players</b> may see it much more easily, is also played at the college, and RNC has its own cricket team, which competes in the British Blind Sport (BBS) National Cricket League. The college also features acoustic shooting, a sport which uses air rifles fitted with photoelectric cells which convert light reflected from targets into sound.|$|E
50|$|To play, {{each player}} selects one warrior card. Then, one player is {{randomly}} {{determined to go}} first, such as with a coin flip. Then, the first player scratches one of the head, arm, leg, or body dots off. If a red blood drop is revealed, <b>that</b> <b>player</b> scratches off again. Otherwise, the other player goes. Each time a red blood drop is revealed, <b>that</b> <b>player</b> scratches off again. After the second blood drop is revealed and after any further blood drops, <b>that</b> <b>player</b> scratches off a life dot. If a red skull is revealed, <b>that</b> <b>player</b> wins.|$|R

5|$|Bughouse can {{be played}} without a clock, but then there is usually a rule {{preventing}} a player waiting for pieces (stalling or sitting) indefinitely. One rule states <b>that</b> <b>players</b> may not delay their move beyond {{the time that it}} takes for their partner to make three moves.|$|E
5|$|In {{designing}} puzzles, Barth {{wanted to}} keep puzzles open-ended, allowing the player {{to come to a}} solution without funneling them in a specific direction. The team designed puzzles based on general chemistry concepts without envisioning the specific solution that the player would take. They brainstormed a number of puzzles and then eliminated those with similar solutions, and arranged the others into a reasonable learning curve for the game. Despite this, Barth reflected that the tutorials provided to explain the game's mechanics had mixed responses, from some players who took up the concept easily to others that remained baffled as to the puzzle's goal even when instructions were set out step by step. In some cases, Barth discovered <b>that</b> <b>players</b> made assumptions on limitations of the game from these tutorials such as the idea that the red and blue waldos must remain in the separate halves of the screen. Based on the feedback <b>that</b> <b>players</b> had made on sites that hosted his previous Flash-based games, Barth designed the global-based histograms to allow players to check their solution without feeling overwhelmed by the top players as would be normally listed on a leaderboard. He also devised the means of sharing solutions through YouTube videos due to similar comments and discussions on the previous games.|$|E
5|$|It {{was later}} {{confirmed}} <b>that</b> <b>players</b> would reprise {{the role of}} Gordon Freeman, unlike the original Half-Life expansion packs, which all dealt with different characters. Valve decided to develop Episode One in-house, as opposed to working with outside contractors as with previous expansions, because the company was already comfortable with the technology and construction tools of Half-Life 2.|$|E

50|$|The {{advertisements}} feature comedians Stephen Curry and Dave Lawson and a footballer re-enacting one or {{more famous}} incidents from <b>that</b> <b>player's</b> career. Curry plays the straight man to Lawson, while the demeanour of the player varies depending upon <b>that</b> <b>player's</b> personality.|$|R
5|$|Louisiana {{attempted}} {{to pass a}} law that would exempt fantasy sports from its anti-online gambling laws, but the bill was defeated as the result of lobbying by both the Louisiana Family Forum (which showed concerns <b>that</b> <b>players</b> could develop an addiction to daily fantasy games), and the Louisiana Video Gaming Association (which felt that DFS would cannibalize the legal video poker industry, and needed to be highly regulated).|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} game's release in North America, a game-breaking glitch was {{discovered}} in the Nintendo 3DS version: saving the game in specific Escape sections would corrupt the saved game's data, forcing the player to restart the game from the beginning. In response, Aksys Games recommended <b>that</b> <b>players</b> avoid saving during Escape sections. By 2013, Aksys Games announced that the glitch had been patched in the Nintendo eShop version, but some players continued to report that the glitch still existed.|$|E
5|$|The 1985 All Blacks tour to South Africa was {{cancelled}} after {{legal action}} {{on the grounds that}} it would breach the NZRU's constitution. In 1986, a rebel tour to South Africa took place that had not been authorised by the NZRU and the team, named the Cavaliers, included many All Blacks. Those that participated in the tour received a ban for two tests from the NZRU when they returned to New Zealand. Allegations <b>that</b> <b>players</b> received payment for the tour were never proved.|$|E

5|$|The Party Play mode was {{inspired}} by recognizing that past Guitar Hero games {{made it difficult to}} jump into without maneuvering through a number of menus and selection screens. The mode was designed to be used at social gatherings, and was adopted to use whatever instrument controllers <b>that</b> <b>players</b> already had available, thus allowing for various other combinations beyond the standard four-person band. This aspect of the game was then brought to the other band modes to allow the game to remain flexible.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} content {{featured}} in the game received mixed reviews. Miller thought that the game only revolved around one idea, which led to its simplistic gameplay. Camron and Cooper thought that the campaign was too short for most players. Shoemaker thought that for a full-priced game, it lacked content. Reiner furthered criticized the game's low replay value. Carter advocated <b>that</b> <b>players</b> purchase the game when its price dropped. He added that while the game features lots of ideas, most of them failed to deliver.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{has been both}} criticised and praised by several commentators. Some viewed her as a competent and professional soldier, and considered her to be less sexualised than other female gaming characters due to her military clothing. Others, however, argued that she was weakened as the protagonist by features that undermined her role as heroine, and criticised some of her sexualised costumes <b>that</b> <b>players</b> receive as rewards for completing certain tasks within the games.|$|E
5000|$|If {{the ball}} touches a player {{anywhere}} on {{or below the}} knee (in some versions, below the ankle or waist), <b>that</b> <b>player</b> is eliminated from the game. If a player hits himself with the ball, accidentally or otherwise, <b>that</b> <b>player</b> is eliminated.|$|R

5|$|The {{family was}} part of a {{national}}-wide debate in the summer of 2015, about more Swedish national players coming from well-educated families in wealthier neighborhoods. Critics have stated <b>that</b> <b>players</b> like Augustinsson are successful today because of the amount of money the families invest in private training sessions.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{informal}} rules governing fighting in ice hockey <b>that</b> <b>players</b> rarely discuss but take quite seriously. The {{most important aspect}} of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers must agree to a fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the regular}} season, a {{constant}} question {{hanging over the}} Virginia Tech Hokies football team was whether or not star quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year at the school. The National Football League requires <b>that</b> <b>players</b> be {{at least three years}} out of high school before they are eligible for the NFL Draft. Vick, who had not played during his freshman year at the school, would be three years out of high school in the spring following the Gator Bowl.|$|E
