25|$|One of {{the search}} and rescue {{aircraft}} deployed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> a PBM Mariner with a 13-man crew, also disappeared. A tanker {{off the coast of}} Florida reported seeing an explosion and observing a widespread oil slick when fruitlessly searching for survivors. The weather was becoming stormy {{by the end of the}} incident. According to contemporaneous sources the Mariner had a history of explosions due to vapour leaks when heavily loaded with fuel, as it might have been for a potentially long search-and-rescue operation.|$|E
25|$|The Ross Sea {{party was}} a {{component}} of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–17. Five men were stranded not far away from Cape Evans. There was sea ice {{between them and the}} relative safety of the hut on Cape Evans. On 8 May two of the men, Aeneas Mackintosh and Victor Hayward, decided to make an attempt to reach the hut. Soon after they set out a blizzard hit. When the weather cleared up, the remaining men tried <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> but realized that the ice was far too thin to cross, and that their friends had been lost. Now they knew that they should wait for a thicker ice and for the full moon to attempt the crossing. Having the full moon was essential, because during polar night the Moon is the only source of natural light other than the extremely dim light of the stars.|$|E
25|$|Ori and Sein {{come across}} two beings in their quest: Gumo, the last {{survivor}} of the spider-like Gumon clan and whose home supports the Wind element; and Kuro, a giant owl who is hostile toward Ori. Her hostility and the forest's cataclysm are explained in flashbacks. When Ori was lost, the Spirit Tree released {{a flash of light}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> which killed all of Kuro's recently hatched offspring. To prevent this from happening to her yet unborn child, Kuro took away the core on top of the Spirit Tree, which is actually Sein. Without the Spirit Tree's support, the three elements cannot be sustained, and Nibel lost its balance. As the element of Wind is rekindled, Gumo, realizing what Ori and Sein intend to do, uses his clan treasure that stores the light from the Spirit Tree to revive Naru, and takes her to where Ori is.|$|E

25|$|The two airmen {{realised}} {{that they}} had to make for the French lines at night or risk capture by the Germans before morning. Bozděch left a pan of water and some more chocolate with the dog, and they locked it inside the farmhouse before heading off across the snow to a nearby wood. Almost immediately upon leaving the property, the night sky was lit up by flares fired by the Germans as they were looking for the aircrew from the nearby crash site. They had nearly reached the trees when they could hear the dog howling from the farmhouse. They agreed that the only course of action was for Bozděch to return and kill the dog. He left Duval in the snow, {{and went back to the}} house. As he approached he searched for a large rock or heavy object with which to kill the puppy in the most humane manner he could. The dog began to throw itself at the locked door as it heard someone approaching. Bozděch opened the door and found he could not kill the animal, instead picking it up and placing it next to his chest inside his flight jacket. The trio made it into the cover of the trees, and were discovered by a party of French troops who had been sent <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> They took the dog back to the base with them, where Duval was sent to the hospital. Bozděch met back up with his fellow Czech airmen in exile, who all played with the puppy. It was decided to name him Ant, after their favourite aircraft from back in Czechoslovakia.|$|E

The game follows her and Barry Burton's daughter Moira as they get kidnapped and find themselves trapped in a mysterious abandoned prison island. There they fight Alex Wesker and the [...] "Afflicted" [...] creatures. In the end both of them survive the events along with Barry, who arrived <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> and a little girl named Natalia Korda.|$|E
500|$|The five {{survivors}} slowly recovered {{their strength}} with {{a diet of}} seal meat. The ice was too thin for them to risk the final trip to Cape Evans, and the monotony of their diet and surroundings became wearisome. On 8 May [...] Mackintosh announced that he and Hayward intended to risk the ice and walk to Cape Evans. Against the strenuous objections of their companions they departed, and within the hour disappeared into a blizzard. The others went <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> after the storm and found only tracks leading {{to the edge of}} the broken ice. Mackintosh and Hayward were never seen again. They had either fallen through the thin ice or had been carried out to sea on an ice floe. Richards, Joyce and Wild waited until 15 July to make the trip to Cape Evans, where they were at last reunited with Stevens, Cope, Jack and Gaze.|$|E

One could get lost coming home then, an' have some fun. Now, it's like driving down Piccadilly." ...|$|R
500|$|Friction emerged at McLaren {{over the}} race weekend. Fernando Alonso {{publicly}} criticised the power unit provided by local company Honda. When being overtaken by Max Verstappen on lap 27, Alonso yelled [...] "GP2 engine, GP2!" [...] {{on the team}} radio, comparing his power unit with those of Formula One's feeder series. Alonso elaborated after the race, saying: [...] "I feel embarrassed when I'm racing sometimes because it's frustrating {{when you see the}} other cars making mistakes, going off the racing line, getting sideways. You look in the mirror on the straight <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> and they are already side by side with you. The deficit we have on power is like another category." [...] Team CEO Ron Dennis in turn criticised Alonso for his outspoken words, saying: [...] "It doesn't show the professionalism I would like all our drivers to show." [...] Jenson Button had expounded the problems of the power unit on team radio as well, lamenting the fact that other cars had been able to pass him into 130R corner. The row in the team, which The Daily Telegraph described as being a [...] "complete meltdown", came amidst speculation about the future of both drivers. Ron Dennis admitted publicly to not having dealt with the question of Jenson Button's role in [...] earlier, following much debate over the driver's future. However, speculation ended when Button was confirmed as a McLaren driver for 2016 just five days later. After the race, Alonso had also left his future with the team open, but made it clear a day later that he intended to end his career with the team, writing: [...] "No one should have any doubt that I have three years with McLaren and my career in F1 will end with this team, hopefully winning everything." [...] About his comments on the team radio he said: [...] "We keep working hard. We all want to win and sometimes transmit the team radios, but it should be private chats." ...|$|E
2500|$|Strictly speaking, a [...] "Catch-22" [...] is [...] "a {{problematic}} {{situation for}} which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule." [...] For example, losing something is typically a conventional problem; to solve it, one looks for the lost item until one finds it. But if the thing lost is one's glasses, one can't see <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> - a Catch-22. The term [...] "Catch-22" [...] is also used more broadly to mean a tricky problem or a no-win or absurd situation.|$|E
2500|$|Some defections occurred, {{most notably}} in 1973, when eight mostly young members, {{commonly}} referred to as the [...] "Gang of Eight", defected together. Because members of the Gang of Eight were aware of sinister threats to potentially defecting members, they suspected that Jones would send a search party <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> Their fears proved to be correct when Jones employed multiple search parties, including one scanning highways from a rented airplane. The Gang of Eight drove three trucks loaded with firearms toward Canada, avoiding watched U.S. Highway 101. Because they feared bringing firearms over the Canada–US border, the Gang of Eight traveled instead to the hills of Montana, where they wrote a long letter documenting their complaints.|$|E

2500|$|Chikatilo was {{initially}} questioned in detail about each charge upon the indictment. Responding to specific {{questions regarding the}} murders, Chikatilo often gave dismissive replies to questions, particularly when questioned as to the specific nature of the wounds he had inflicted upon his victims and the ruses he had used to entice his victims to the locations where he had killed them. He would become indignant only when accused of stealing personal possessions from the victims, or to his retaining organs excised from the victims missing from the crime scenes. On one occasion, when asked as to his seeming indifference as to the lifestyle and gender of those whom he had killed, Chikatilo replied: [...] "I did not need <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> Every step I took, they were there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mongol {{horses are}} frugal, hardy, {{somewhat}} wily, and tread safely in rough terrain. [...] In Mongolia, most animals are kept roaming free, {{and only a}} small number of riding animals are caught and tethered. [...] A nomad's herd of horses hangs out around the family's dwelling, typically grazing several miles away. [...] The herd is allowed to choose its own pasturage with little interference from the owners. [...] They may disappear for days at a time, and eventually the owners go out <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> [...] Once a horse has become familiar with carrying a rider, it will be calm, friendly, and very reliable. [...] Because nature provides so well for [...] Mongol horses, they cost little to nothing to raise. [...] They are a practical necessity of everyday life, in which a substantial portion of the population still lives as nomads. [...] Herdsmen regard their horses as both a form of wealth and a source of the daily necessities: transportation, food, and drink.|$|E
