5|$|Krips {{left the}} LSO in 1954, and the {{following}} year tensions between the orchestral principals and the rank-and-file players erupted into an irreconcilable dispute. <b>The</b> <b>principals</b> argued {{that the future of}} the LSO lay in profitable session work for film companies, rather than in the overcrowded field of London concerts. They also wished to be free to accept such engagements individually, absenting themselves from concerts if there were a clash of dates. The LSO's board, which reflected the majority opinion of the players, refused to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>principals,</b> most of whom resigned en masse, to form the Sinfonia of London, a session ensemble that flourished from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s, and then faded away. For fifteen years after the split the LSO did little film work, recording only six soundtracks between 1956 and 1971, compared with more than 70 films between 1940 and 1955.|$|E

5|$|Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works was a 19th-century {{manufacturer}} of railroad steam locomotives based in Paterson, in Passaic County, New Jersey, in the United States. It built {{more than six}} thousand steam locomotives for railroads around the world. Most railroads in 19th-century United States rostered at least one Rogers-built locomotive. The company's most famous product was a locomotive named The General, built in December 1855, {{which was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>principals</b> of the Great Locomotive Chase of the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|This ceiling conceals the mediaeval trusses of {{the fifteenth}} century ceiling. The wagon roof over the chancel was boarded or plastered, as slots in <b>the</b> <b>principals</b> show, in 1491 by William Stratford, DTh, Abbot of Vale Royal Abbey (in post 1476–1516, with gaps); the exact dating was derived from the timbers, which retain {{complete}} sapwood. The original ceiling can still be reached from the ringing chamber in the central tower, and includes an arch-braced collar-beam truss, with traces of five cross-ribs equally spaced on the soffit of the four-centred moulded arch. The truss had slots for the panels of a boarded ceiling (a wagon roof).|$|E
5|$|Webster's first {{priority}} was {{to appoint a}} musical director to build the company from scratch. He negotiated with Bruno Walter and Eugene Goossens, but neither of those conductors was willing to consider an opera company with no leading international stars. Webster appointed a little-known Austrian, Karl Rankl, to the post. Before the war, Rankl had acquired considerable experience in charge of opera companies in Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia. He accepted Webster's invitation to assemble and train <b>the</b> <b>principals</b> and chorus of a new opera company, alongside a permanent orchestra that would play in both operas and ballets.|$|E

5|$|Although Australia {{does not}} have any nuclear power reactors, Pangea Resources {{considered}} siting an international repository in the outback of South Australia or Western Australia in 1998, but this stimulated legislative opposition in both states and the Australian national Senate during the following year. Thereafter, Pangea ceased operations in Australia but reemerged as Pangea International Association, and in 2002 evolved into the Association for Regional and International Underground Storage with support from Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, Japan and Switzerland. A general concept for an international repository has been advanced by one of <b>the</b> <b>principals</b> in all three ventures. Russia has expressed interest in serving as a repository for other countries, but does not envision sponsorship or control by an international body or group of other countries. South Africa, Argentina and western China have also been mentioned as possible locations.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Hooters was {{sponsoring}} a car driven by Mark Stahl, another owner-driver in the Cup series. Unlike Kulwicki, Stahl was a part-time participant who had trouble making races. The Hooters car {{failed to make}} the field for the Motorcraft Quality Parts 500 and the Atlanta-based chain, desiring a spot in the race, approached the sponsorless Kulwicki to gauge his interest. <b>The</b> <b>principals</b> agreed to at least a one-race deal, which became a much longer term deal when Kulwicki recorded an eighth-place finish in the race. Later in the season, Kulwicki won the Bristol night race for his third career win. In 29races, he had eleven top10 finishes, fourpoles, and finished 13th in the points.|$|E
5|$|In an August 10 Small Group meeting, <b>the</b> <b>principals</b> {{agreed to}} use Tomahawk cruise {{missiles}}, rather than troops or aircraft, in the retaliatory strikes. Cruise missiles {{had been previously}} used against Libya and Iraq as reprisals for the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing and the 1993 attempted assassination of then-President George H. W. Bush. Using cruise missiles also helped to preserve secrecy; airstrikes would have required more preparation that might have leaked {{to the media and}} alerted bin Laden. The option of using commandos was discarded, as it required too much time to prepare forces, logistics, and combat search and rescue. Using helicopters or bombers would have been difficult {{due to the lack of}} a suitable base or Pakistani permission to cross its airspace, and the administration also feared a recurrence of the disastrous 1980 Operation Eagle Claw in Iran. While military officials suggested bombing Kandahar, which bin Laden and his associates often visited, the administration was concerned about killing civilians and hurting the U.S.' image.|$|E
40|$|I {{show that}} <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> and <b>the</b> agent may each prefer that <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> or <b>the</b> agent has {{imperfect}} information about <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> 2 ̆ 7 s technology in a principal-agent environment with moral hazard. Principals expend considerable resources on data cumulation and analysis. However, such investments in information acquisition are benecial {{only if the}} agent will know that <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> is not ignorant or it allows <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> to implement a dierent action. When <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> is perfectly informed about her technology, the agent prefers to be ignorant. In addition, the value of perfect information for the agency is negative if <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> would implement <b>the</b> same action with either possible technology. I also investigate the dierences between ex ante and ex post contracting, and the ramications of <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> being ignorant or potentially ignorant about the technology. Finally, I determine if <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> 2 ̆ 7 s utility varies continuously with the degree of informativeness of the agent about <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> 2 ̆ 7 s technology. In this vein, I determine whether the agent 2 ̆ 7 s uncertainty may make <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> better o if she has the less informative technology. <br /...|$|R

5|$|The {{committee}} {{signed off}} on all of Zahorchak's proposals except for his call to remove four principals in exchange for up to $15million in federal grants that mandate leadership or staff changes {{as a condition for}} receiving the money. Zahorchak proposed transferring <b>the</b> <b>principals</b> from the Allen and Dieruff high schools, Central Elementary and Harrison-Morton Middle School to the district's nonprofit foundation, then use the federal grant money to open a special school for advanced placement and honors students. The committee did not vote or comment on the matter on October 14. Zahorchak said he still planned to pursue the plan but apologized for speaking to the media about it on October 12 before discussing it with the district and staff, a move that caused angst among the staff and some members of the public.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{accompanied}} Richard on the Third Crusade, {{and was one}} of <b>the</b> <b>principals</b> {{involved in}} raising Richard's ransom after the king was captured in Germany on his return from the Holy Land. As a reward for his faithful service, Walter was selected to become Archbishop of Canterbury in 1193. He also served as Richard's justiciar until 1198, in which role he was responsible for raising the money Richard needed to prosecute his wars in France. Walter set up a system that was the precursor for the modern justices of the peace, based on selecting four knights in each hundred to administer justice. He also revived his predecessor's dispute over setting up a church to rival Christ Church Priory in Canterbury, which was only settled when the pope ordered him to abandon the plan. Following Richard's death in 1199, Walter helped assure the elevation of Richard's brother John to the throne. Walter also served John as a diplomat, undertaking several missions to France.|$|E
5|$|William left England {{towards the}} end of 1086. Following his arrival back on the {{continent}} he married his daughter Constance to Alan Fergant, the Duke of Brittany, in furtherance of his policy of seeking allies against the French kings. William's son Robert, still allied with the French king Philip I, appears to have been active in stirring up trouble, enough so that William led an expedition against the French Vexin in July 1087. While seizing Mantes, William either fell ill or was injured by the pommel of his saddle. He was taken to the priory of Saint Gervase at Rouen, where he died on 9 September 1087. Knowledge of the events preceding his death is confused because there are two different accounts. Orderic Vitalis preserves a lengthy account, complete with speeches made by many of <b>the</b> <b>principals,</b> but this is likely more of an account of how a king should die than of what actually happened. The other, the De Obitu Willelmi, or On the Death of William, {{has been shown to be}} a copy of two 9th-century accounts with names changed.|$|E
50|$|Moral hazard also {{arises in}} a principal-agent problem, where one party, called an agent, acts {{on behalf of}} another party, called <b>the</b> <b>principal.</b> <b>The</b> agent usually has more {{information}} {{about his or her}} actions or intentions than <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> does, because <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> usually cannot completely monitor the agent. The agent may have an incentive to act inappropriately (from the viewpoint of <b>the</b> <b>principal)</b> if <b>the</b> interests of the agent and <b>the</b> <b>principal</b> are not aligned.|$|R
50|$|In modern {{commercial}} law, {{the agent}} is simply and solely {{the representative of}} <b>the</b> <b>principal,</b> on whose behalf the agent transacts with third parties.
