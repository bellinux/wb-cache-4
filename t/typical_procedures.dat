In general, EMTs provide what is considered basic life support and are limited to essentially non-invasive procedures. Besides employing basic medical assessment skills, <b>typical</b> <b>procedures</b> provided by EMTs include CPR, Automated external defibrillation, mechanical ventilation using a bag-valve mask, placement of air way adjuncts such as oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airways, pulse oximetry, glucose testing using a glucometer, splinting (including spinal immobilization and traction splints), and suctioning. In addition, EMT-Bs are trained to assist patients with administration of certain prescribed medications, including nitroglycerin, Metered-dose inhaler such as albuterol, and epinephrine auto injectors such as the EpiPen. EMT-Bs can typically also administer certain non-preprescribed drugs including oxygen, oral glucose, and activated charcoal (usually upon medical direction). In response to the opioid overdose epidemic, states are rapidly changing protocols to permit EMT-Bs to administer naloxone as well.|$|E

Hiebert has written extensively about the failure of <b>typical</b> <b>procedures</b> for establishing text difficulty to recognize how the decodability of a word can inflate a text's difficulty. Similarly, she has noted that conventional readability formulas penalize texts that have sufficient repetition for readers to develop automaticity in word recognition and pronunciation.|$|E

50|$|Pattern {{matching}} and substitution: After performing {{image segmentation}} and match searching, {{and if a}} match exists, we code an index of the corresponding representative bitmap in the dictionary and {{the position of the}} character on the page.

If a match is not found, the segmented pixel block is coded directly and added into the dictionary. <b>Typical</b> <b>procedures</b> of pattern matching and substitution algorithm are displayed in the left block diagram of the figure above. Although the method of PM&S can achieve outstanding compression, substitution errors could be made during the process if the image resolution is low.|$|E

40|$|The aim of our ongoing {{research}} is to give a method to construct intelligent tutoring systems for agents who are ex-ecuting <b>typical</b> <b>procedures</b> in dynamic environments based on a logical framework. <b>Typical</b> <b>procedures</b> are similar to plans {{in the sense that}} they describe the actions an agent should execute to achieve a certain goal. In this paper we address what we consider is the first step toward the con-struction of this kind of systems: procedure recognition. We formalize what does it mean that an agent is perform-ing a procedure in the Situation Calculus [12], a logical first-order language extended with induction. Based upon this formalization, we give two different implementations. The first, which is directly based in our formalization, is proved to be quite inefficient. The second, significantly more efficient, arises from a logical reformulation of the original formalization. Procedures are represented through CON-GOLOG [6] programs, a logical interpreted language based on the Situation Calculus. ...|$|E
