Originating within 8AU of the star, this exozodiacal dust may be evidence of dynamical perturbations within the system.

5|$|Newly {{discovered}} planets, particularly {{ones that}} are potentially habitable, have enabled SETI and METI programs to refocus projects for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. In 2009 A Message From Earth (AMFE) was sent toward the Gliese 581 planetary system, which contains two potentially habitable planets, the confirmed Gliese 581d and the more habitable but unconfirmed Gliese 581g. In the SETILive project, which began in 2012, human volunteers analyze data from the Allen <b>Telescope</b> <b>Array</b> to search for possible alien signals that computers might miss because of terrestrial radio interference. The data for the study is obtained by observing Kepler target stars with the radio telescope.|$|E
5|$|To detect {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{with radio}} telescopes, one must identify an artificial, coherent signal {{against a background}} of various natural phenomena that also produce radio waves. Telescopes capable of this include the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the newer Allen <b>Telescope</b> <b>Array</b> in Hat Creek, California. Various programs to detect extraterrestrial intelligence have had government funding in the past. Project Cyclops was commissioned by NASA in the 1970s to investigate {{the most effective way to}} search for signals from intelligent extraterrestrial sources, but the report's recommendations were set aside in favor of the much more modest approach of Messaging to Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (METI), the sending of messages that intelligent extraterrestrial beings might intercept. NASA then drastically reduced funding for SETI programs, which have since turned to private donations to continue their search.|$|E

The telescope was one of the prototypes for the Allen <b>Telescope</b> <b>Array</b> that were tested at Leuschner, and has since been used in the undergraduate radio astronomy lab. The telescope operates between 1320–1740 MHz and uses an 8192 element spectrometer with spectral resolution of about 1.5kHz and a 12MHz bandwidth. The operating range allows for it to be used to observe the 21-cm hydrogen line as well as hydroxyl lines from astrophysical masers.|$|E

In 2002, astronomers Margaret Turnbull and Jill Tarter developed the Catalog of Nearby Habitable Systems (HabCat) {{under the auspices}} of Project Phoenix, another SETI endeavour. The list contained more than [...] theoretically habitable systems, approximately 10% of the original sample. The next year, Turnbull would further refine the list to the 30 most promising systems out of [...] within one hundred light-years of the Sun, including Tau Ceti; this will form part of the basis of radio searches with the Allen <b>Telescope</b> <b>Array.</b> She also chose Tau Ceti for a final shortlist of just five stars suitable for searches by the (indefinitely postponed) Terrestrial Planet Finder telescope system, commenting that [...] "these are places I'd want to live if God were to put our planet around another star".|$|E

2500|$|The SETI Institute {{collaborated with}} the Radio Astronomy Laboratory at University of California, Berkeley to develop a {{specialized}} radio <b>telescope</b> <b>array</b> for SETI studies, something like a mini-cyclops array.

2500|$|Planets in the CHZ remain of {{paramount}} interest to researchers looking for intelligent life {{elsewhere in the}} universe. The Drake equation, sometimes used to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in our galaxy, contains the factor or parameter , which is {{the average number of}} planetary-mass objects orbiting within the CHZ of each star. A low value lends support to the Rare Earth hypothesis, which posits that intelligent life is a rarity in the Universe, whereas a high value provides evidence for the Copernican mediocrity principle, the view that habitability—and therefore life—is common throughout the Universe. A 1971 NASA report by Drake and Bernard Oliver proposed the [...] "water hole", based on the spectral absorption lines of the hydrogen and hydroxyl components of water, as a good, obvious band for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence that has since been widely adopted by astronomers involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. According to Jill Tarter, Margaret Turnbull and many others, CHZ candidates are the priority targets to narrow waterhole searches and the Allen <b>Telescope</b> <b>Array</b> now extends Project Phoenix to such candidates.|$|E
