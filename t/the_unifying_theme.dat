25|$|Музыка (Music, 1926) {{contained}} 33 poems, most {{of which}} had been previously published, which had been written between 1916 and 1925. The collection was dedicated to Tsuberbiller, though Erarskaya (known in the lyrics as Mashenka) is the most prevalent of her lover-muses in the collection. <b>The</b> <b>unifying</b> <b>theme</b> of music, with lyrics including instruments, musical phrases, performers, and sounds, charts the relationship of Parnok and Erarskaya from their first meeting to Mashenka's madness.|$|E
25|$|Circles and squares form <b>the</b> <b>unifying</b> <b>theme</b> of the {{interior}} design. The checkerboard floor pattern contrasts with the concentric circles of square coffers in the dome. Each zone of {{the interior}}, from floor to ceiling, is subdivided according to a different scheme. As a result, the interior decorative zones do not line up. The overall effect is immediate viewer orientation according to the major axis of the building, even though the cylindrical space topped by a hemispherical dome is inherently ambiguous. This discordance {{has not always been}} appreciated, and the attic level was redone according to Neoclassical taste in the 18th century.|$|E
500|$|Back in England, Crawford {{finished}} writing Man and his Past, {{which was}} published by Oxford University Press in 1921. According to the historian of archaeology Adam Stout, the book was [...] "a manifesto, a rallying-cry {{for a new generation}} of archaeologists who shared in the idealism and the faith in the potential of Progress". Bowden suggested that it could be seen as a [...] "manifesto for geoarchaeology, environmental archaeology and economic archaeology. <b>The</b> <b>unifying</b> <b>theme</b> is that all these topics should be approached through the compilation of maps". In discussing geographical methods for delineating [...] "cultures", the work fit within the theoretical trend of culture-historical archaeology, but did not attempt to apply the concept of culture in a systematic fashion.|$|E

2500|$|When Frederick III, Elector Palatine {{came into}} power in 1559 {{he put his}} {{authority}} behind the Calvinistic view on the Lord's Supper, which denied the local presence {{of the body of}} Jesus Christ in the elements of the sacrament. He turned Sapienz College into a school of divinity, and in 1562 he placed over it a pupil and friend of Luther's colleague, Philipp Melanchthon, named Zacharias Ursinus. In an attempt to resolve the religious disputes in his domain, Frederick called upon Ursinus and his colleague Caspar Olevianus (preacher to Frederick's court) to produce a catechism. The two collaborators referred to existing catechetical literature, and especially relied on the catechisms of Calvin and of John Lasco. To prepare the catechism, they adopted the method of sketching drafts independently, and then bringing together the work to combine their efforts. [...] "The final preparation was the work of both theologians, with the constant co-operation of Frederick III. Ursinus has always been regarded as the principal author, as he was afterwards the chief defender and interpreter of the Catechism; still, {{it would appear that the}} nervous German style, the division into three parts (as distinguished from the five parts in the Catechism of Calvin and the previous draft of Ursinus), and the genial warmth and unction of the whole work, are chiefly due to Olevianus." [...] (Schaff, in. Am. Presb. Rev. July 1863, p.379). The structure of the Heidelberg Catechism is spelled out in the second question; and the three-part structure seen there is based on the belief that the single work of salvation brings forward the three persons of the Trinity in turn, to make God fully and intimately known by his work of salvation, referring to the Apostles' Creed as an epitome of Christian faith. Assurance of salvation is <b>the</b> <b>unifying</b> <b>theme</b> throughout this catechism: assurance obtained by the work of Christ, applied through the sacraments, and resulting in grateful obedience to the commandments and persistence in prayer.|$|E

[...] On the album's content, Verellen said: [...] "Two of the tracks are things we did live that {{we just wanted to}} record" [...] and one of the songs was [...] "just a riff we never got a song written for, but it was just such a good riff."

50|$|Unlike Pāṇini's {{objectives}} in the Ashtyadhyayi, {{which is to}} distinguish correct forms and meanings from incorrect ones (shabdaunushasana), Patanjali's objectives are more metaphysical.

Some have argued that his conclusions are best understood as a product of his times, experiences and education.
