5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, several factors, including changes in international free trade policies, inflation and the Savings and Loans Crisis contributed to <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> that impacted cities like Cleveland. While unemployment during the period peaked in 1983, Cleveland's rate of 13.8% was higher than the national average due to the closure of several production centers.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper is}} a study of a {{business}} <b>recessions.</b> On <b>the</b> ground of the actual financial crisis, which has broad international influence, many questions about possibilities of efficient solutions of <b>the</b> economic <b>recessions</b> have been opened. In the economics history is possible to find many examples of business recessions and more or less successful solution methods. Each recession has several analogical characters with other <b>recessions.</b> <b>The</b> similarity of <b>the</b> <b>recessions</b> is utilized in this study as the base for fuzzy model of <b>the</b> business <b>recessions.</b> <b>The</b> fuzzy logic is very useful tool for modeling, because absolute as well as relative quantitative indicators {{can be used in}} the model. The fuzzy model of <b>the</b> business <b>recession</b> is based on the data of <b>the</b> American's <b>recessions</b> and also covers the data about the Japanese crisis and one example of <b>the</b> Czech business <b>recession.</b> <b>The</b> model was utilized for research of the recessions' similarities and for the prediction of the aspect of <b>the</b> future business <b>recessions...</b>|$|R

Comparing {{patterns}} before and after <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession,</b> <b>the</b> unemployment rates were much higher in the second period, 6.72 % for immigrants and 6.39 % for natives, nearly double those {{in the first period}} (3.96 and 3.50 %).

30|$|While the {{absolute}} poverty and deprivation rates increased massively during <b>the</b> 1990 s <b>recession,</b> <b>the</b> 2008 – 2009 recession {{had very little}} impact on poverty. Relative poverty was also apparently unaffected by <b>the</b> latest <b>recession,</b> following <b>the</b> ongoing upward trend. The downturn in GDP during <b>the</b> most recent <b>recession</b> was very deep but swift, which to some extent {{may be explained by}} the restructuring of the Swedish economy after <b>the</b> earlier <b>recession</b> (cf.

Even <b>the</b> strongest <b>recession</b> (in Latvia) was found smaller in its magnitude than the Great Depression 1929 - 1933 in the USA. Hence, comparisons of <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession</b> to <b>the</b> Great Depression {{in the literature}} are somewhat exaggerated. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> Great <b>Recession</b> is {{characterized}} by a GDP-decline that was unprecedented in the past decades. This paper discusses the implications of <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession</b> analyzing labor market data from 20 OECD countries. Comparing <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession</b> with <b>the</b> 1980 s <b>recession</b> it is concluded that there is a high cross-country correlation of the unemployment rates over <b>the</b> two <b>recessions</b> indicating that some labor markets are more vulnerable to fluctuations in economic growth than others. Young workers are the most affected by <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession</b> both in terms of unemployment rates as well as employment rates. For prime age workers employment rates were also affected but for older workers <b>the</b> Great <b>Recession</b> did not have a large impact. To analyze how economic growth and labor market institutions have affected unemployment two types of models are estimated. The main conclusion is rather straightforward and has a "one size fits all" character: to reduce unemployment and create jobs economic growth is needed...|$|R

5|$|In August 2008, the Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) {{announced}} {{a campaign to}} redesign the buildings on the island, and six designs were submitted. One of the designs removed the existing buildings and piers to replace them with walking paths, and added a large curvilinear concrete building to the island. The design called for many windows in the building to create a large panorama of the surrounding seascape. In September 2010 Urban Splash placed the pier up for sale, citing a downfall in business caused by <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> as their reason.|$|E

50|$|There {{is a view}} {{termed the}} halfway rule {{according}} to which investors start discounting an economic recovery about halfway through a <b>recession.</b> In <b>the</b> 16 U.S. <b>recessions</b> since 1919, <b>the</b> average length has been 13 months, although <b>the</b> recent <b>recessions</b> have been shorter. Thus if <b>the</b> 2008 <b>recession</b> followed <b>the</b> average, the downturn {{in the stock market}} would have bottomed around November 2008. The actual US stock market bottom of <b>the</b> 2008 <b>recession</b> was in March 2009.|$|R

5|$|The {{effects of}} <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> {{which began in}} 1893, and which {{continued}} through 1896, ruined many Americans. Contemporary estimates were an unemployment rate as high as 25%. The task of relieving the jobless fell to churches and other charities, {{as well as to}} labor unions. Farmers went bankrupt; their farms were sold to pay their debts. Some of the impoverished died of disease or starvation; others killed themselves.|$|E

The Jaguar XJ220 had attracted a significant number of speculators who hoped the scarcity of the XJ220 and enthusiasm for the Jaguar marque would push up prices overnight, allowing large profits to be made over a short period of time.|$|E

5|$|By early 1896, {{many in the}} Democratic Party were bitterly {{opposed to}} President Cleveland and his policies. The United States was by then {{in the third year}} of a deep recession, the Panic of 1893. Cleveland was a firm {{supporter}} of the gold standard, and soon after <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> began forced through repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which he believed had helped cause it. Sherman's act, although not restoring bimetallism, had required the government to purchase and coin large quantities of silver bullion, and its repeal outraged supporters of free silver. Other Cleveland policies, such as his forcible suppression of the Pullman strike, led to the Democrats losing control of both houses of Congress in the 1894 midterm elections, and to a revolt against him by silver supporters within his party.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, the {{regional}} policy of bringing businesses into disadvantaged areas of Wales through financial incentives had proven very successful in diversifying the industrial economy. This policy, begun in 1934, was enhanced by the construction of industrial estates and improvements in transport communications, most notably the M4 motorway linking south Wales directly to London. It was believed that the foundations for stable economic growth had been firmly established in Wales during this period; but this view was shown to be wildly optimistic after <b>the</b> <b>recession</b> of the early 1980s saw the collapse of much of the manufacturing base that had been built over the preceding forty years.|$|E
