5|$|There are two {{fragments}} of <b>the</b> <b>lists</b> of Hebrew names; {{one on the}} recto of the first surviving folio and one on folio 26, which is currently inserted {{at the end of}} the prefatory matter for John. The first list fragment contains the end of the list for the Gospel of Matthew. The missing names from Matthew would require an additional two folios. The second list fragment, on folio 26, contains about a fourth of the list for Luke. The list for Luke would require an additional three folios. The structure of the quire in which folio 26 occurs is such that it is unlikely that there are three folios missing between folios 26 and 27, so that it is almost certain that folio 26 is not now in its original location. There is no trace of <b>the</b> <b>lists</b> for Mark and John.|$|E
50|$|When {{a message}} {{is sent to}} a mailing <b>list,</b> <b>the</b> mailing <b>list</b> {{software}} re-sends it {{to all of the}} addresses on <b>the</b> <b>list.</b> <b>The</b> presence of invalid addresses in <b>the</b> <b>list</b> results in bounce messages being sent to the owner of <b>the</b> <b>list.</b> If <b>the</b> mailing <b>list</b> is small, <b>the</b> owner can read the bounce messages and manually remove the invalid addresses from <b>the</b> <b>list.</b> With a larger mailing list, this is a tedious, unpleasant job, so it is desirable to automate the process.|$|R

30|$|The {{connectivity}} function checks if a given set {{of blocks}} forms a path. An arbitrary block is selected from <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of ordered blocks treated so far. For {{each of the}} remaining blocks, it is investigated after adding a block to <b>the</b> <b>list</b> at appropriate place, whether <b>the</b> <b>list</b> forms a path. The block can be added in the head or tail of <b>the</b> <b>list.</b> When no block is added to <b>the</b> <b>list,</b> it is investigated whether all the blocks {{have been added to}} <b>the</b> <b>list.</b> If this is the case, the set forms a path otherwise it does not generate any path.|$|R

5|$|The current naming scheme {{began with}} the 1978 season, one year before the Atlantic basin (and which anomalously used the list {{that will be used}} next in 2018, rather than the one for 2020).
