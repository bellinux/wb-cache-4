5|$|Dislocations are {{the most}} common {{structural}} defect in natural diamond. The two major types of dislocations are the glide set, in which bonds break between layers of atoms with different indices (those not lying directly above each other) and <b>the</b> <b>shuffle</b> set, in which the breaks occur between atoms of the same index. The dislocations produce dangling bonds which introduce energy levels into the band gap, enabling the absorption of light. Broadband blue photoluminescence has been reliably identified with dislocations by direct observation in an electron microscope, however, it was noted that not all dislocations are luminescent, and there is no correlation between the dislocation type and the parameters of the emission.|$|E
5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>shuffle</b> format was introduced, the Hot Seats and {{corresponding}} monitors were {{replaced with a}} single podium, and as a result, the contestant and host stand throughout the game and are also able {{to walk around the}} stage. Also, two video screens were installed–one that displays the current question in play, and another that displays the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernized look and feel, in order {{to take into account the}} show's transition to high-definition broadcasting, which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens had; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and light-emitting diode (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colors and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.|$|E
5|$|A second noted {{house in}} the Dupont Circle {{neighborhood}} which is claimed to be haunted is the Woodrow Wilson House (2340 S Street NW). Woodrow Wilson was elected President of the United States in 1912, was re-elected in 1916 promising to keep the nation out of war, led the nation through World War I, and left office in 1921. At 2 AM on September 26, 1919, while traveling to Wichita, Kansas, on a nationwide speaking tour to win public support to pressure the Senate into ratifying the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson collapsed and, after cancelling {{the rest of his}} speaking tour, was rushed back to the capital by train. His condition worsened on the journey, and upon arriving at the White House on October 2 the President suffered a life-threatening stroke that left him permanently paralyzed on his left side and blind in the left eye. Although the President lived, he was confined to bed for two months, seen only by his wife, a few close associates, and his physicians. From December 1919 to April 1920 Wilson required a wheelchair. Wilson attended his first Cabinet meeting in April 1920, {{but for the rest of}} the year his mind continued to wander, his memory was marred, and he tired easily. By March 1921 (when he left office) Wilson was able to walk short distances with the use of a cane (and with a valet close at hand). The extent of Wilson's disability was kept from the public until after his death on February 3, 1924. President and Mrs. Wilson purchased a large home at 2340 S Street NW, to which a number of modifications were made (including the addition of an elevator). Woodrow Wilson received few guests in his last years, and died in his third floor bedroom on February 3, 1924. His wife, Edith Bolling Galt Wilson, lived in the home until her death on December 28, 1961, and willed the home to the National Trust for Historic Preservation to be made into a museum honoring her husband. In the decades since her death, staff and visitors at the Woodrow Wilson House claim to have seen the President's ghost sitting in his rocking chair, heard <b>the</b> <b>shuffle</b> of a man walking with a cane, and heard a man sob.|$|E

25|$|Arnold Snyder's {{articles}} in Blackjack Forum magazine brought shuffle tracking {{to the general}} public.

30|$|When {{examining}} {{the presence of}} LRTCs it is standard practice to compare the exponent of the actual data to the exponent of <b>the</b> data randomly <b>shuffled</b> [4]. By <b>shuffling</b> <b>the</b> data this should destroy any correlations present and so the exponent of <b>the</b> <b>shuffled</b> data {{is expected to be}} approximately 0.5. We compared the original sequence (whose DFA plot is shown in Fig.  11) with 500 <b>shuffled</b> sequences. <b>The</b> DFA plots for <b>the</b> <b>shuffled</b> sequences (data not shown) did not exhibit crossover points, with the same linear trend being observed across all box sizes. The mean exponent of <b>the</b> <b>shuffled</b> sequences was 0.50 with a range of 0.48 – 0.52. Therefore, as the exponents of the original sequence (at smaller box sizes) do not fall within the distribution of exponents for <b>the</b> <b>shuffled</b> sequences this further demonstrates that the original sequence exhibits complex temporal ordering with correlations that extend across a range of box sizes (up to the upper crossover).|$|R

25|$|Another {{important}} {{influence to}} jazz was the blues, {{an expression of}} the hardships experienced daily by slaves, in direct contrast to the work song, a celebration of work. Its musical inspiration came from where its players did, Africa. The rhythmic form of blues was a basis for many developments that would appear in jazz. Though its instrumentation was mostly limited to melodic instruments and a singer, feeling and rhythm were tremendously important. The two primary feels were a pulse on alternating beats that we see in countless other forms of American music, and <b>the</b> <b>shuffle,</b> which is essentially the pattin' juba rhythm, a feel based on a division of three rather than two.|$|E

25|$|Techniques {{other than}} card {{counting}} can swing {{the advantage of}} casino blackjack toward the player. All such techniques {{are based on the}} value of the cards to the player and the casino as originally conceived by Edward O. Thorp.

Shuffle tracking requires excellent eyesight and powers of visual estimation but is more difficult to detect since the player's actions are largely unrelated to the composition of the cards in the shoe.|$|E

These two products together can be seen as a conscious effort on the part of Apple management to target a lower-end market and increase visibility in the mass-market. Previously, the success of Apple's iPod and especially the iPod Mini had been chipping away at the inexpensive flash player market, causing flash players at the beginning of 2005 to account for less than half the market share they did in 2004. However, the original and Mini iPods were expensive and <b>the</b> <b>Shuffle</b> was intended to make the iPod compete with mainstream players.|$|E

500|$|At its core, {{the game}} is a quiz {{competition}} in which {{the goal is to}} correctly answer a series of fourteen (originally fifteen) consecutive multiple-choice questions. The questions are of increasing difficulty, except in the 2010–15 format overhaul, where the contestants were faced with a round of ten questions of random difficulty, followed by a round of four questions of increasing difficulty. Each question is worth a specified amount of money; the amounts are cumulative in the first round, but not in the second. If the contestant gives a wrong answer to any question, their game is over and their winnings are reduced (or increased, in the first two questions) to $1,000 for tier-one questions, $5,000 for tier-two questions, and $50,000 for tier-three questions. However, the contestant has the option of [...] "walking away" [...] without giving an answer after being presented with a question, in which case the game ends and the contestant is guaranteed to walk away with all the money they have previously received. With the exception of <b>the</b> <b>shuffle</b> format, upon correctly answering questions five and ten, contestants are guaranteed at least the amount of prize money associated with that level. If the contestant gives an incorrect answer, their winnings drop down to the last milestone achieved. Since 2015, if the contestant answers a question incorrectly before reaching question five, he or she leaves with $1,000, even on the first question that is worth only $500. For celebrities, the minimum guarantee for their nominated charities is $10,000. Prior to <b>the</b> <b>shuffle</b> format, a contestant left with nothing if (s)he answered a question incorrectly before reaching the first milestone. In <b>the</b> <b>shuffle</b> format era, contestants who incorrectly answered a question had their winnings reduced to $1,000 in round one and $25,000 in round two.|$|E

Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>shuffle</b> format was introduced to Millionaire, Vieira stated in an interview with her Millionaire predecessor on his morning talk show that the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer.|$|E

500|$|During <b>the</b> <b>shuffle</b> format era, {{the show}} {{introduced}} a new lifeline, [...] "Jump the Question", which {{was able to be}} used twice in a single game for seasons nine through twelve. At any point prior to selecting a final answer, a contestant could use Jump the Question to skip the current question and {{move on to the next}} one, thus reducing the number of questions they had to correctly answer. However, if the contestant used Jump the Question, they did not gain any money from the question they chose to skip (for example, a contestant would not gain the typical $100,000 if they jumped to the $250,000 question). This lifeline could not be used on the $1 million question, since it is the final question in the game. The [...] "Plus One" [...] lifeline, introduced in season thirteen, allows a contestant to bring a companion with him or her to the podium for help in answering a question. The introduction of this lifeline reduced the number of Jump the Question lifelines available from two to one.
