5|$|Whether an epikleros who {{was married}} {{at the time of}} her father's death was {{required}} to divorce her current spouse and marry the anchisteia is unclear. Most modern historians have come to the conclusion that this was only required if the epikleros had not yet had a son that could inherit the grandfather's estate. The clearest evidence is from the Roman playwright Terence, in his play Adelphoe, which includes a plot element involving a claim that a girl is actually an epikleros. Although the play was written in the 2nd century BCE, Terence adapted most of his plays from earlier Athenian comedies, which makes it slightly more reliable as a source. And common sense argues that if a son had already been born to an epikleros, there was no need <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> the epikleros to a relative in order to provide a male heir to the grandfather's estate. Although the anchisteia had the right to marry the epikleros, he was not required to do so, and could refuse the match or find another spouse for the heiress. It was also possible for the husband of an epikleros, who was not her anchisteia, to buy off the anchisteia in order to remain married to his wife. Such cases were alleged by the speaker of Isaeus' speech Isaeus 10 as well as a character in Menander's play Aspis.|$|E
25|$|It was at {{this time}} in the Convention that Reverend Manasseh Cutler arrived to lobby for western land sales. He brought acres of land grants <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>out.</b> Their sales would fund most of the U.S. {{government}} expenditures for its first few decades. There were allocations for the Ohio Company stockholders at the Convention, and for others delegates too. Good to his word, in December 1787, Cutler led a small band of pioneers into the Ohio Valley.|$|E
25|$|Rudolf V (Archduke, Emperor Rudolf II 1576–1612), Maximilian's eldest son, {{moved his}} capital from Vienna to the safer venue of Prague, {{in view of}} the Ottoman threat. He was noted as a great patron of the arts and {{sciences}} but a poor governor. Among his legacies is the Imperial Crown of the Habsburgs. He preferred <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> his responsibilities among his many brothers (of whom six lived to adulthood), leading to a great heterogeneity of policies across the lands. Among these delegations was making his younger brother Mathias, Governor of Austria in 1593.|$|E
5000|$|After {{leaders of}} both Jamaican {{political}} parties, Hugh Shearer and Michael Manley, each paid visits to the community in September 1969, Selassie himself again visited and, according to EWF #37 leader Mortimer Planno, cautioned them against bringing Jamaican politics to Ethiopia. The following year, the Imperial Court ordered ten hectares apiece <b>to</b> be <b>parceled</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> twelve [...] "pioneer" [...] Rastafari settlers, as reported in The Gleaner on September 5, 1970.|$|R
50|$|The {{community}} of Liberal grew up three {{miles south of}} Mulino {{on the south side}} of the Molalla River. The Liberal crossroads is located at the mutual corners of the donation land claims established in the 1840s by Harrison Wright, William Russell, W. D. Woodcock, James Barnard and Francis Jackson. As the original land claims began <b>to</b> be <b>parceled</b> <b>out,</b> the area was settled in the mid-19th century, primarily by Swiss and German families.|$|R
2500|$|The Peace of Westphalia in 1648 {{had been}} a {{political}} defeat for the Habsburgs. It ended the idea that Europe was a single Christian empire; governed spiritually by the Pope and temporally by the Holy Roman Emperor. Moreover, the treaty was devoted <b>to</b> <b>parceling</b> <b>out</b> land and influence to the [...] "winners", the anti-Habsburg alliance led by France and Sweden. However, the Habsburgs did gain some benefits out of the wars; the Protestant aristocracy in Habsburg territories had been decimated, and the ties between Vienna and the Habsburg domains in Bohemia and elsewhere were greatly strengthened. These changes would allow Leopold to initiate necessary political and institutional reforms during his reign to develop somewhat of an absolutist state along French lines. The most important consequences {{of the war was}} in retrospect to weaken the Habsburgs as emperors but strengthen them in their own lands. Leopold was the first to realize this altered state of affairs and act in accordance with it.|$|R
25|$|The Royalists faced many {{difficulties}} in Military Region 2. Fire Support Base Puncher, the Ban Na outpost of Long Tieng, {{was surrounded by}} PAVN infantry and sappers. On 14 February 1971, an accidental bombing killed 30 civilians. By 15 February, Vang Pao's L'Armee Clandestine was in desperate shape. The PAVN were {{within striking distance of}} the main guerrilla base at Long Tieng. The next two Unity Battalions, BCs 603 and 604, were pulled from the final stages of training and sent to reinforce the Hmong irregulars. To maintain unit integrity, the Thais had to fend off Vang Pao's attempt <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> platoons of Thai replacements into Hmong guerrilla units. The Thais were trained to fight cohesively as mobile offensive troops, and they intended to retain that capability.|$|E
500|$|Manasseh Cutler came {{directly}} from the capital in New York and found himself a frequent dinner guest among the delegates. [...] He carried grants of five million acres <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> among The Ohio Company and [...] "speculators", including some who were attending the Convention. A Philadelphia guest of Robert Morris, Noah Webster would write a pamphlet immediately after the signing. [...] "Leading Principles of the Federal Convention" [...] advocated adoption of the Constitution. [...] It was published much earlier and more widely circulated than today's better known Federalist Papers.|$|E
60|$|By this, {{he again}} made known {{the vastness of}} his hospitality, which led him for the nonce <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> his kingdom with his guests.|$|E
50|$|In the 1930s, {{increasing}} demand for water led {{the city to}} officially incorporate on February 1, 1934. David Gilbert Randall was elected the first mayor. He served in this position for ten years. That same decade saw {{the creation of the}} Cherry Days celebration on July 4. As North Ogden grew after World War II, it became a primary suburb for Ogden and other larger cities. Its industries flagged, and most agricultural areas began <b>to</b> be <b>parcelled</b> <b>out</b> for homes.|$|R
50|$|In 1934, direct {{bilateral}} {{negotiations between the}} U.S. and Mexican governments worked to settle the general and special claims through ordinary diplomatic channels. Compensation was established by an agreed-to formula (2.64% of face value) and claims were lumped together rather than examined on an individual basis. The compensation was paid in installments from one government to the other, <b>to</b> be <b>parceled</b> <b>out</b> by that government to the claimants. The quiet diplomacy rather than the bilateral commission accomplished the result of clearing the claims.|$|R
50|$|On 12 February, a minor {{breach in}} the Finnish {{lines in the}} Lähde sector led to disaster. By that time, so many {{breaches}} had occurred in the Mannerheim Line that the reports concerning them were virtually disregarded. The following morning, a Finnish counter-attack {{was supposed to be}} launched by the entire 5th Division, the only reserve in easy reach of the front-line, but only one of the three regiments was available as the other two regiments had <b>to</b> be <b>parceled</b> <b>out</b> elsewhere.|$|R

60|$|But {{nothing is}} to be {{attained}} without striving. In a determined effort to settle the thoughts, <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> the day, to find occupation regularly or to make it, to be up and doing something, are chiefly to be found the mere mechanical means which must {{come to the aid}} of the best mental efforts.|$|E
60|$|When {{the house}} door {{closed with a}} bang and a shake, it seemed to Miss Kimmeens {{to be a very}} heavy house door, {{shutting}} her up in a wilderness of a house. But, Miss Kimmeens being, as before stated, of a self-reliant and methodical character, presently began <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> the long summer-day before her.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1539 and 1545, the Nevin family {{obtained}} {{the lands of}} East and West Monkredding from Alexander, Abbot of Kilwinning. Thomas Nevin was the first secular proprietor of the lands, [...] "part of the ancient halydom of Kilwinning, which about this time was beginning <b>to</b> be <b>parcelled</b> <b>out</b> by the Abbots, to whoever would best remunerate them for the ostensible gift, foreseeing that their own possession was becoming doubtful and unsteady." [...] The old name of the place is stated as Moncarden or Monks Garden.|$|R
60|$|Hardly {{was this}} vague article inserted, than, {{without waiting for}} any act {{on the part of}} Hyder, Mr. Hastings enters into a {{negotiation}} with the Mahratta chief, Scindia, for a partition of the territories of the prince {{who was one of the}} objects to be secured by the treaty. He was <b>to</b> be <b>parcelled</b> <b>out</b> in three parts: one to Scindia; one to the Peishwa of the Mahrattas; and the third to the East India Company, or to (the old dealer and chapman) Mahomet Ali.|$|R
50|$|In 1830, {{however, the}} State of Georgia seized land in its south {{that had belonged}} to the Cherokee {{since the end of the}} Creek War, land {{separated}} from the rest of the Cherokee Nation by a large section of Georgia territory, and began <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> it <b>out</b> <b>to</b> settlers. Major Ridge dusted off his weapons and led a party of thirty south, where they drove the settlers out of their homes on what the Cherokee considered their land, and burned all buildings to the ground, but harmed no one.|$|R
6000|$|As he saw us {{he threw}} off his pack {{to rest and}} stood erect, a sturdy man of sixty, with short bristling hair framing a kindly {{resolute}} face. He was very light-hearted. He shook hands with me, saying, [...] "Kla-how-ya," [...] in answer to my, [...] "Kla-how-ya six," [...] which is to say, [...] "How are you, friend?" [...] He smiled, pointed to his pack, and said, [...] "Hy-u skin." [...] His season had been successful {{and he was going}} now to sell his catch. A couple of dogs just behind carried each twenty pounds on their backs. We were eating lunch, and I invited him to sit and eat. He took a seat and began <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> the food in two piles.|$|E
60|$|Traddles's {{house is}} one of the very houses--or it easily may have been--which he and Sophy used <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>out,</b> in their evening walks. It is a large house; but Traddles keeps his papers in his dressing-room and his boots with his papers; and he and Sophy squeeze {{themselves}} into upper rooms, reserving the best bedrooms for the Beauty and the girls. There is no room to spare in the house; for more of 'the girls' are here, and always are here, by some accident or other, than I know how to count. Here, when we go in, is a crowd of them, running down to the door, and handing Traddles about to be kissed, until he is out of breath. Here, established in perpetuity, is the poor Beauty, a widow with a little girl; here, at dinner on Sophy's birthday, are the three married girls with their three husbands, and one of the husband's brothers, and another husband's cousin, and another husband's sister, who appears to me to be engaged to the cousin. Traddles, exactly the same simple, unaffected fellow as he ever was, sits {{at the foot of the}} large table like a Patriarch; and Sophy beams upon him, from the head, across a cheerful space that is certainly not glittering with Britannia metal.|$|E
60|$|A {{republication}} of Pope's works, with notes, {{offered him}} an easier occupation than the digesting of those scattered {{materials for the}} History of Poetry which he had thus assisted in disarranging. He was probably glad to escape from inaction, and set himself <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> his Essay into comments for this edition; which, in 1797, was published in nine volumes. His indiscretion, in adding to it some of Pope's productions which had been before excluded, has been most bitterly censured. That {{it would have been}} better to let them remain where they were can scarcely be questioned. But I should be more willing to regard the insertion of them as proof of his own simplicity, in suspecting no harm from what he had himself found to be harmless, than of any design to communicate injury to others. A long life, passed without blame, and in the faithful discharge of arduous duties, ought to have secured him from this misconstruction at its close. After all, the pieces objected to are such as are more offensive to good manners than dangerous to morality. There are some other of Pope's writings, more likely to inflame the passions, which yet no one scruples to read; and Dr. Wooll has suggested that it was inconsistent to set up the writer as a teacher of virtue, and in the same breath to condemn his editor as a pander to vice.|$|E
50|$|First: The Mexican federal {{government}} resolved century-old property disputes {{of land that}} had communal status, land the {{federal government}} had appropriated from the Union en Cuale mining company <b>to</b> be <b>parceled</b> <b>out</b> as communal farms. The land's communal (ejido) status had stifled development in the town for much of the 20th century. A significant transition of communal lands into private ownership within present Puerto Vallarta city limits took place in 1973 with the establishment of the Vallarta Land Trust (Fideicomiso) to oversee selling government land into private hands, and using the sales revenue to develop the City's infrastructure.|$|R
50|$|The six-year {{exploration}} licence Gilbert had secured by letters patent from the crown in 1578 {{was on the}} point of expiring, when he succeeded in 1583 in raising significant sums from English Catholic investors. The investors were constrained by penal laws in their own country, and loath to go into exile in hostile parts of Europe; the prospect of American settlement appealed to them, especially as Gilbert was proposing to seize some nine million acres (36,000 km²) around the river Norumbega, <b>to</b> be <b>parcelled</b> <b>out</b> under his authority (although to be held ultimately by the Crown).|$|R
6000|$|... "Against that I {{have nothing}} to say, Reuben. I can find no authority, in Scripture, for the Spaniards {{claiming}} {{a portion of the}} seas as their right. The world is all, as it seems to me, open to trade, and neither the pope nor anyone else has a right <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> it <b>out,</b> for the exclusive use of one or two nations. As we all know, the seas within a mile or two of shore are held to belong, naturally, to those who own the land; but that is a different thing, altogether, to holding that more than half the seas, inasmuch as we know of them, are to be held as private property by Spaniards and Portugals.|$|R
60|$|There is {{a certain}} class of {{difficulties}} which surrounds the sober idealist in all speculations about the not too distant future. These are the cases where the solution believed by most idealists to be universally applicable is for some reason impossible, and is, at the same time, objected to for base or interested motives by all upholders of existing inequalities. The case of Tropical Africa will illustrate what I mean. It would be difficult seriously to advocate the immediate introduction of parliamentary government for the natives {{of this part of}} the world, even if it were accompanied by women's suffrage and proportional representation. So far as I know, no one supposes the populations of these regions capable of self- determination, except Mr. Lloyd George. There can be no doubt that, whatever regime may be introduced in Europe, African negroes will {{for a long time to}} come be governed and exploited by Europeans. If the European States became Socialistic, and refused, under a Quixotic impulse, to enrich themselves at the expense of the defenseless inhabitants of Africa, those inhabitants would not thereby gain; on the contrary, they would lose, for they would be handed over to the tender mercies of individual traders, operating with armies of reprobate bravos, and committing every atrocity to which the civilized barbarian is prone. The European governments cannot divest themselves of responsibility in regard to Africa. They must govern there, and the best that can be hoped is that they should govern with a minimum of cruelty and rapacity. From the point of view of preserving the peace of the world, the problem is <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> the advantages which white men derive from their position in Africa in such a way that no nation shall feel a sense of injustice. This problem is comparatively simple, and might no doubt be solved on the lines of the war aims of the Inter-Allied Socialists. But it is not this problem which I wish to discuss. What I wish to consider is, how could a Socialist or an Anarchist community govern and administer an African region, full of natural wealth, but inhabited by a quite uncivilized population? Unless great precautions were taken the white community, under the circumstances, would acquire the position and the instincts of a slave-owner. It would tend to keep the negroes down to the bare level of subsistence, while using the produce of their country to increase the comfort and splendor of the Communist community. It would do this with that careful unconsciousness which now characterizes all the worst acts of nations. Administrators would be appointed and would be expected to keep silence as to their methods. Busybodies who reported horrors would be disbelieved, and would be said to be actuated by hatred toward the existing regime and by a perverse love for every country but their own. No doubt, in the first generous enthusiasm accompanying the establishment of the new regime at home, there would be every intention of making the natives happy, but gradually they would be forgotten, and only the tribute coming from their country would be remembered. I do not say that all these evils are unavoidable; I say only that they will not be avoided unless they are foreseen and a deliberate conscious effort is made to prevent their realization. If the white communities should ever reach the point of wishing to carry out as far as possible the principles underlying the revolt against capitalism, they will have to find a way of establishing an absolute disinterestedness in their dealings with subject races. It will be necessary to avoid the faintest suggestion of capitalistic profit in the government of Africa, and to spend in the countries themselves whatever they would be able to spend if they were self-governing. Moreover, it must always be remembered that backwardness in civilization is not necessarily incurable, and that with time even the populations of Central Africa may become capable of democratic self-government, provided Europeans bend their energies to this purpose.|$|E
50|$|The {{two groups}} decided {{that there was}} plenty of land for everybody, and when Fawkner arrived on 16 October with another party of settlers, they agreed <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> land and not dispute who was there first. Both Batman and Fawkner settled in the new town.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{opposition}} of the Roman Senate and of his own father, the Roman political leader Gaius Flaminius Nepos wins {{the passage of a}} measure to distribute land among the plebeians.

60|$|Two {{days are}} passed. It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me {{down at a}} place called Whitcross; he could take me no farther for the sum I had given, and I was not possessed of another {{shilling}} in the world. The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone. At this moment I discover that I forgot <b>to</b> take my <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> of the pocket of the coach, where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain; and now, I am absolutely destitute.|$|R
30|$|Europe is {{aging and}} its labor force shrinking. This is not news. But {{the speed and}} size of these {{developments}} is shocking, and should motivate policy responses. Labor market regulations, interventions, and institutions are restraining growth, {{and they must be}} updated. Education and training systems will need reform to enable workers to take up more productive jobs, with greater ease and to greater profit. Europeans are still less likely to move than people {{in other parts of the}} world, and the success of the single market in services depends on their becoming more mobile. To do all this, Europe’s policymakers will have to convince themselves and their constituents that the rewards of hard work can be shared sensibly without treating labor as a fixed lump <b>to</b> be <b>parceled</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Santa Fe Trail {{crossed the}} plains just {{southwest}} of Philmont in the mid-1800s. The Tooth of Time owes {{its name to}} this trail; travelers knew that once they passed it, they had only one week to go until they reached Santa Fe, New Mexico. Philmont's strategic location along the trail spurred some interest in it. In 1841, Carlos Beaubien and Guadalupe Miranda obtained a large land grant from the Mexican government, including the present ranch. Soon the grant fell {{into the hands of}} Beaubien's son-in-law Lucien Maxwell, who {{played an important role in}} developing and settling it. Maxwell sold the ranch to the Maxwell Land Grant and Railroad Company, which gave up and handed it on to a Dutch development company, which decided <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> it <b>out</b> <b>to</b> ranchers.|$|R
50|$|In May 1991, {{violence}} {{initiated by}} members of the Honduran military resulted in the deaths of eight farmers. To keep similar situations around the country from escalating into violence, the government promised <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> land belonging to the National Corporation for Investment (Corporación Nacional de Inversiones—Conadin). The government also pledged to return to peasants land that had been confiscated by the Honduran military in 1983.|$|E
50|$|The sole {{official}} {{function of}} the comunidades, currently, is <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> their land at government-approved rates. However, supporters of the comunidade movement, have been waging a determined, if small, campaign to safeguard {{what they see as}} their rights, and continue to fight against the erosion of the comunidade system in Goa, by, for example, bringing land ownership lawsuits. In 2004, the Goa Su-Ray Party issued a polemic supporting the comunidades.|$|E
50|$|At {{this time}} Moon Township {{occupied}} an enormous {{tract of land}} - possibly 145 sq mi. The sheer difficulty of residents performing their civic duties (e.g., report to assigned polling places or attend jury trials) made it necessary for local governing authorities <b>to</b> <b>parcel</b> <b>out</b> the land into smaller municipalities. So in 1790, the current Fayette Township was portioned off from Moon Township, {{to be followed by}} Findlay and Crescent townships, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Diarmait {{himself had}} {{returned}} to Ireland shortly before this, possibly as early as August 1167, with a small force – that included Richard FitzGodebert, and {{a small number of}} Knights and Archers. Another force under Raymond le Gros landed at Baginbun (then called Dún Domhnaill) in 1170. Mac Murrough died in 1171 and was buried at Ferns. His Kingdom, since regained, passed to Strongbow (Richard de Clare), contrary to Irish custom. Strongbow had married Aoife (or Eva), Diarmait's daughter, in 1170. Strongbow, after first submitting <b>to</b> the King, <b>parcelled</b> <b>out</b> these lands <b>to</b> his followers according to feudal law.|$|R
