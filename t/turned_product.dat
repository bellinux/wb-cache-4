40|$|Many {{manufacturing}} industries involve machining operations. In {{metal cutting}} the turning process {{is one of}} the most fundamental cutting processes used. Surface finish and dimensional tolerance, are used to determine and evaluate the quality of a product, and are major quality attributes of a <b>turned</b> <b>product.</b> In this paper experimental work has been carried out for the optimization of input parameters for the improvement of quality of the product of turning operation on CNC machine. Feed Rate, Spindle speed & depth of cut are taken as the input parameters and the dimensional tolerances as output parameter. In the present work L 9 Array has been used in design of experiment for optimization of input parameters. This paper attempts to introduce and thus verifies experimentally as to how the Taguchi parameter design could be used in identifying the significant processing parameters and optimizing the surface roughness in the turning operation. The present work shows that spindle speed is the key factor for minimizing the dimensional variation for minimizing the surface roughness...|$|E
40|$|Optimization {{in turning}} means {{determination}} of the optimal set of the machining parame-ters to satisfy the objectives within the operational constraints. These objectives may be the minimum tool wear, the maximum metal removal rate (MRR), or any weighted combi-nation of both. The main machining parameters which are considered as variables of the optimization are the cutting speed, feed rate, depth of cut, and nose radius. The optimum set of these four input parameters is determined for a particular job-tool combination of 7075 Al alloy- 15 wt. % SiC (20 – 40 lm) composite and tungsten carbide tool during a single-pass turning which minimizes the tool wear and maximizes the metal removal rate. The regression models, developed for the minimum tool wear and the maximum MRR were used for finding the multiresponse optimization solutions. To obtain a trade-off between the tool wear and MRR the, a method for simultaneous optimization of the multiple responses based on an overall desirability function was used. The research deals with the optimization of multiple surface roughness parameters along with MRR {{in search of an}} optimal parametric combination (favorable process environment) capable of producing desired surface quality of the <b>turned</b> <b>product</b> in a relatively lesser time (enhancement in productivity). The multi-objective optimization resulted in a cutting speed of 210 m/min, a feed of 0. 16 mm/rev, a depth of cut of 0. 42 mm, and a nose radius of 0. 40 mm. These machining conditions are expected to respond with the minimum tool wear and maximum the MRR, which correspond to a satisfactory overall desirability. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4023454...|$|E
