5|$|After the Boss rescues Kinzie {{from her}} nightmare, she devises {{a plan to}} crash the simulation, which will force the Zin to draw power from their ship to keep it running, thus {{weakening}} the ship itself and creating an opening for the Saints to enter. Working together, the remaining Saints manage to overload the simulation, shutting it down just as the Boss escapes. Assaulting Zinyak's ship, the Boss finds power armor emulating the powers {{they had in the}} simulation, and confronts Zinyak in his throne room. While the entire Zin Empire watches, Zinyak and the Boss battle each other. With help from the Saints, the Boss kills Zinyak by tearing his head off and emerges victorious. Impressed, the Zin forces surrender <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boss,</b> who becomes the new head of the Zin Empire.|$|E
5|$|Next, Kinzie leads a {{successful}} effort {{to drive the}} Deckers out of Steelport, causing Miller to abandon the Syndicate and return to his home country after losing a virtual fight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boss.</b> Finally, alongside Muerte, the Boss enters Murderbrawl XXXI and humiliates Killbane by defeating him in physical combat. With his image shattered, Killbane goes on a rampage through Steelport. While working to contain the damage, the Boss is informed that STAG, {{in an attempt to}} discredit the Saints, has rigged the Steelport Monument with explosives, leaving several kidnapped Saints, including Shaundi, Viola, and Mayor Burt Reynolds at the site to frame them. At the same time, Killbane is fleeing the country by private flight.|$|E
5|$|Similar to {{previous}} {{games in the}} WarioWare series, WarioWare: Smooth Moves is a puzzle game focusing on microgames, which are short games that last for about five seconds. Each microgame requires that the player position the Wii Remote in a specific way, such as holding it vertically, or placing the bottom end of the device against the nose. The player is required to use the Nunchuk attachment for the Wii Remote in certain microgames. Before each microgame begins, the required position for the Wii Remote is shown to the player, to allow them time to position the device. The game is broken up into stages, each represented by a WarioWare character and loosely connected by a story, with the microgames divided among the stages. After the player completes a stage's microgames, they advance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> stage, which is a microgame that is longer and {{more complex than the}} others. After the player completes all of the single-player stages, the game unlocks a multiplayer mode, in which only one Wii Remote is used and shared by up to 12 players. While a player plays a microgame in this mode, other players watch, and after the microgame is completed, the player passes the Wii Remote to the next person.|$|E

50|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> various <b>bosses</b> in <b>the</b> game {{being able}} to cast a spell that kills the main {{character}} in 30 seconds, each hero is forced {{to make a contract}} with the Time Goddess that lets the player rewind time in exchange for increasing amounts of gold.

25|$|The actual {{structure}} {{of any given}} clan can vary. Despite the name decina, they do not necessarily have ten soldiers, but can have anything from five to thirty. Some clans are so small that they don't even have decinas and capodecinas, and even in large clans certain soldiers may report directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss.</b>|$|E
25|$|The consigliere ("counselor") of {{the clan}} is also elected on a yearly basis. One of his jobs is to {{supervise}} {{the actions of the}} boss and his immediate underlings, particularly in financial matters (e.g. preventing embezzlement). He also serves as an impartial adviser <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> and mediator in internal disputes. To fulfill this role, the consigliere must be impartial, devoid of conflict of interest and ambition.|$|E
25|$|The game's {{story is}} often mapped onto exploration, where each {{chapter of the}} story is mapped onto a {{different}} location. RPGs usually allow players to return to previously visited locations. Usually, there is nothing left to do there, although some locations change throughout the story and offer the player new things to do in response. Players must acquire enough power to overcome a major challenge in order to progress to the next area, and this structure can be compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> characters at the end of levels in action games.|$|E
50|$|After {{completing}} the game, a password is given, which allows player <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> character (D.D.Fox) in the game. When playing as D.D.Fox, <b>the</b> final <b>boss</b> is Mike.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, an {{increasingly}} power-hungry Vogel plans to destroy The Saints {{so he can}} expand Ultor's control over all of Stilwater. When an initial effort to kill The Saints' leadership is foiled by The Boss, the Saints respond by destroying a high-security Ultor lab. The company's executives try to rein in Vogel, so he sends their locations <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Boss,</b> which he uses to kill them. Appointing himself chairman, Vogel hosts {{a press conference to}} denounce the Saints. Gat and The Boss open fire on the conference, forcing Vogel to retreat into his office. Destroying the building's defenses, the Boss enters and kills Vogel.|$|E
25|$|When a Mafia boss retires from {{leadership}} (or is killed), his clan's {{reputation as}} effective protectors and enforcers often goes with him. If his replacement has a weaker reputation, clients may lose {{confidence in the}} clan and defect to its neighbours, causing {{a shift in the}} balance of power and possible conflict. Ideally, the successor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> will have built a strong reputation of his own as he worked his way up the ranks, giving the clan a reputable new leader. In this way, established Mafia clans have a powerful edge over newcomers who start from scratch; joining a clan as a soldier offers an aspiring mafioso a chance to build up his own reputation under the guidance and protection of senior mafiosi.|$|E
25|$|In Should Old Acquaintance Be Forgot?, Naomi {{is still}} rocking her party-planning {{internship}} under Rachel’s guidance. Her relationship with Austin has ended after Austin allegedly cheated on her with Holly. Austin says Holly snuck in and attacked him {{right after he}} came out of the shower but Naomi refuses to listen to him. Naomi has been so hard at work that her boss, Holly’s mother, gives Naomi the responsibility of hosting her very own event, which is the debutant ball. During the ball, Naomi has rebound sex with a stranger in order to get over Austin. After Naomi has been caught in front of the entire party, Rachel fires her. However, Naomi tells her that Rachel's daughter cheated with her boyfriend. Rachel has sympathy and lets it slide but advises Naomi that she has to be a strong woman and deal with her problems. In Mama Can You Hear Me?, Naomi decides to become a ‘New Naomi’ and try to patch things between Holly and her mother. Rachel briefs Naomi about the impending award season. She entrusts Naomi with a very important assignment. Naomi suggests to her boss that maybe Holly can help too. Although Rachel is reluctant, she agrees to go with Naomi’s suggestion, and appoints Holly as Naomi’s new assistant; shocking both Naomi and Holly. Naomi tries to make amends with Holly, by entrusting her with the very important assignment of getting Mitchell Nash from the hotel to the event. At the event, Rachel is really happy with the way Naomi has organized things, while she is waiting intently for Holly to arrive with Mitchell Nash. Holly arrives at the scene and tells them that Mitchell Nash wasn’t staying at the hotel she had gone <b>to.</b> <b>The</b> <b>boss</b> blasts Naomi for entrusting such an important responsibility to Holly, who according to her has always been irresponsible. Holly and Naomi, haul in a completely drunk Nash to the event. He pukes on the red carpet, with the reporters having a field day. Later Holly and her mother are at it, with Holly trying to defend her position in all that transpired. Naomi again tries defending Holly in front of her mother. The whole thing proves counterproductive, with Naomi getting fired. Later, Holly thanks Naomi for all that she did for her and they both decide to become friends.|$|E

500|$|There are six bosses in the game, {{based on}} House of the Dead 2 bosses. Losing a boss battle results in being {{sent back to}} the main board, where the player must regain access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss.</b> The game also {{features}} a [...] "Challenge" [...] mode, increasing the game's difficulty. Full-motion video sequences and audio samples from previous entries in the series appear in the game.|$|E
500|$|One day, Luke {{picks up}} a deadly {{rattlesnake}} from the grassy ditch and holds it up for Boss Godfrey to shoot with his rifle. Luke tosses the snake <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> as a joke, before he hands him his walking cane. Dragline advises Luke {{to be more careful}} about his actions pertaining to the [...] "man with no eyes." [...] A rainstorm causes everyone to prematurely end their work. Before he joins the other prisoners in the truck, Luke shouts to God, testing him. On that same evening, Luke receives a letter stating that his mother has died.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} certain stages, {{the player}} can call on Mega Man's faithful dog Rush to reach higher platforms or cross large gaps using his [...] "Coil" [...] and [...] "Jet" [...] transformations. These abilities require refills {{with the same}} weapon energy that Master Weapons use. Some of the level designs in Mega Man 5 are different from earlier games in the series. For example, in Gravity Man's stage, the gravitation is reversed from the floor to the ceiling, while in Wave Man's stage, the player drives a water craft from the halfway point <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> room. Hidden {{within each of the}} eight Robot Master stages is a collectible circuit board. Gathering all eight of these boards (spelling [...] "M-E-G-A-M-A-N-V") gives the player access to a robot-bird friend by the name of Beat. The player can then call on Beat to attack any onscreen enemies.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{each area}} there is a <b>boss</b> that <b>the</b> player must defeat. However the Scratch Cats can't harm <b>the</b> <b>bosses</b> directly. <b>The</b> player must figure out how <b>to</b> harm <b>the</b> <b>boss,</b> in most cases by using their attack against them.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>boss</b> of each island {{awaits the}} player on a {{specific}} stage at the beginning. However, if the player is defeated while fighting a <b>boss,</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> will move <b>to</b> another area, forcing the player not only to clear his current stage, but also another one in order <b>to</b> fight <b>the</b> <b>boss.</b>|$|R

500|$|The bosses on {{the skull}} of Achelousaurus may have been covered in a keratinous sheath in life, but their shape in a living animal is uncertain. In 2009, the {{paleontologist}} Tobin L. Hieronymus and colleagues examined correlations between skull morphology, horn, and skin features of modern horned animals, and examined {{the skull of}} centrosaurine dinosaurs for the same correlates. They proposed that the rugose bosses of Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus were covered by thick pads of cornified (or keratinized) skin, similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> of modern muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus). The nasal horncore of adult Achelousaurus had an upward slant and its upper surface had correlates for a thick epidermal (outer layer of skin) pad that graded into correlates for a cornified sheath on the sides. A thick pad of epidermis may have grown from the V-shaped pitted notch {{at the tip of}} the nasal horncore. The growth direction of the nasal pad would have been towards the front. The supraorbital bosses may have had a thick pad of epidermis, which grew at a sideways angle similar to the curved horncores of Coronosaurus, as indicated by the orientation of the [...] "fins" [...] or ridges on the bosses. That the supraorbital bosses lacked a sulcus (or furrow) at their bases indicates that their horn pads stopped at the wrinkled edges of the bosses. The pitting might indicate a softer growing layer connecting the hard inner bone with the hard horn sheath. In addition, correlates for a rostral scale in front of the nasal boss and scale rows along the parietal midline and supraorbital-squamosal region were identified.|$|E
500|$|Tom's exit {{allowed the}} writers {{to pull the}} focus on the other characters, namely Danny and Zoe, to give the show more of an {{ensemble}} feel. Overall, the producers made the third series more character driven. Raymond Khoury felt that because the length of a Spooks episode is one and half times longer than the average American television episode, the writers could use the extra time to flesh out the characters. Khoury also noted another difference between Spooks and American television is that most American seasons usually consists of 22 episodes, much of those episodes are more plot driven, while Spooks series three only had 10 and hence all of them contain some character development. The main character developments include Zoe's relationship with Will, which Danny did not like because {{he was in love with}} her. The writers initially wanted to expand on the potential Danny and Sam Buxton relationship which began in the second series, but the idea was dropped in favour of his affection towards Zoe, as the producers believed that was delivering more. Harry was given more depth by introducing his estranged daughter in [...] "Who Guards the Guards?". Through the daughter's introduction, Harry would appear more human as opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> who [...] "barks orders" [...] to his officers. When Hawes announced she wanted to leave, Richards decided to write a [...] "big episode" [...] to give Zoe a decent send off. Richards did not want to kill off the character, as he deemed it predictable. Oyelowo eventually decided to leave the series as well between filming episodes four and five; by then the finale was not yet written. The actor wanted Danny to be killed off, reasoning that since Tom and Zoe left as disgraced officers, having Danny leave a disgraced officer also would be [...] "one time too many" [...] for a series that is meant to second guess the audience. In addition, Oyelowo did not want the [...] "lingering thought" [...] of a possible return. The producers wanted to use Danny's death as a powerful end to the series.|$|E

2500|$|Of {{the other}} opinion, GameZone's James Wynne {{felt that the}} game's story {{explanation}} was a valid enough reason for her scantily-clad appearance and succeeds in Kojima's aim to make Quiet [...] "a true antithesis to sexy-just-because female characters." [...] He wrote that [...] "Fan service doesn't erase the fact that Quiet is a strong, well-written character that doesn't need a man to save her. That puts her on a level comparable <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Boss,</b> who was the most impressive female character to ever grace a video game." ...|$|E
2500|$|The dermis {{generating}} the horn is anchored <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss</b> by interpenetration between rugosities – various irregularities of bone, which it creates by deposition. This tissue is a specialisation of dermal armour, which, whenever it attaches to bone, deposits the rugosities {{to strengthen the}} attachment. The author states that rugosity is [...] "a bony signature of dermal armor". Cranial rugosity is an indication, but not a sure sign, of a horn. If, on the other hand, an annular (ring-shaped) pattern is visible in the rugosity, it is due to [...] "stress concentration {{at the edges of}} horns" [...] and is [...] "the signature for epidermal horns".|$|E

Genovese family informant Vincent Cafaro revealed to the FBI during the trial that Salerno was just a figurehead; Gigante had been the real boss of the family since 1981. [...] Before then, the FBI had missed a number of clues that Gigante was the real boss. [...] For instance, FBI bugs caught several instances of mafiosi discussing how Gigante had ordered murders—under Mafia rules, a power solely reserved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>boss.</b> [...] Most tellingly, an FBI bug captured a conversation in which Salerno and capo Matthew [...] "Matty the Horse" [...] Ianniello were reviewing a list of prospective candidates to be made in another family. Frustrated that the nicknames of the wannabes hadn't been included, Salerno shrugged and said, [...] "I'll leave this up to the boss." ...|$|E

50|$|Another new {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> series is EX Skills, which {{are similar to}} Mega Man's ability to copy powers from <b>the</b> <b>bosses</b> in previous series. Unlike the previous series, however, Zero has to have an A or S rank going into <b>the</b> stage <b>to</b> unlock <b>the</b> <b>bosses</b> EX Skill. Unlike Mega Man's copy ability, which required weapon energy <b>to</b> feed <b>the</b> attacks, EX Skills modify Zero's weapons, adding new abilities or replacing their normal abilities with an ability similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> defeated <b>boss.</b> For example, <b>the</b> Buster Shot can be modified to fire a long-piercing beam instead of its normal charged blast, while the Z-Saber gains additional moves such as a powerful rising slash.|$|R
