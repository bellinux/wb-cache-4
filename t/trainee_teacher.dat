The population of the study was 439 third year <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers</b> who had Just completed a yearlong school attachment programme.

It was found out that <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers</b> viewed lecturers as better placed to help in their academic development than the mentors, and that <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers</b> viewed mentors as better placed to help in their professional development than lecturers.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{described}} a study designed to examine pre-service teachers’ teaching experiences and challenges {{with the school}} administrators, mentor, supervisor, as well as teaching and learning process. A total of 38 students (which onwards cited as <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers)</b> of TESL (Executive) programme at the Faculty of Education, National University of Malaysia who had completed their two months teaching practicum in various schools in Malaysia responded {{to a set of}} open-ended questions. The results showed that as a whole, the <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers</b> indicated positive comments on their relationship with school administrator regarding the administrators’ attitude towards the <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers</b> and the cooperation given by the administrators in managing the <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers.</b> They also felt that their mentor had guided and helped them a lot in terms of teaching and learning process as well as in managing the class. Apart from that, the findings also indicated that the <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers</b> found that their supervisors were very helpful and supportive and they did not have problems with the school environment. However, challenges can be seen in terms of the students’ attitude towards the <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers</b> and the learning of the language, students’ motivation, students’ discipline, and support system.

40|$|<b>Trainee</b> <b>teachers</b> in {{voluntary}} teaching post have diverse {{experiences that}} shape their teaching journey. Structural contexts related to teaching employment landscapes, education policy, institutional cultures and circumstances {{in addition to}} the <b>trainee</b> <b>teacher’s</b> own characteristics, motivations and personal situations all interact to affect how teachers train. Research funded by the Education and Training Consortium aimed to explore how trainees, course tutors and other stakeholders viewed the learning experience of <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers</b> in voluntary teaching posts. Fieldwork was undertaken from December 2014 – May 2015. Data was collected from a questionnaire completed by centre managers and 25 semi-structured interviews with centre staff, current Year 2 volunteer trainees and mentors, plus two focus groups of <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers.</b> Volunteer teaching posts can often be successful and offer valuable resources to both the trainee and affiliated institution. However, the balance between a <b>trainee</b> <b>teacher’s</b> learning experiences, their role, responsibilities and rights in their voluntary teaching post, and their developmental needs must be carefully managed as these can have important implications for a trainee’s professional identity and prospects of completing the course...|$|R
40|$|Volunteer <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers</b> (<b>trainee</b> <b>teachers</b> {{who teach}} on an unpaid basis {{and not on}} a pre-service course) are present {{in a number of}} {{institutions}} across the lifelong learning sector (LLS) in England, giving the opportunity to gain entry into the teaching profession to those who might otherwise face difficulties in accessing paid teaching. Whilst statistics on volunteer <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers</b> are not collected, {{it is difficult to determine}} whether the numbers of such trainees are a constant across the sector or if they are a minority or a substantial proportion of total trainee numbers. However, the backdrop of a severe economic recession and consequent public expenditure cuts to education, resulting in real or perceived threats to employment for teachers in the LLS (IFS 2011), may have increased the numbers of volunteer <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers.</b> The paper explores the introduction of voluntary teaching practice in a large university/college partnership and raises questions about the consequences for the organisation and teacher educators in terms of the profile, motivation and experience of the volunteer <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers</b> and any differing perceptions of their teacher educators. These include tensions around the professionalisation agenda, the equality of access (including those with disabilities) agenda, and whether voluntary teaching opportunities facilitate this. Questionnaires and interviews with volunteer <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers,</b> teacher educators and mentors were undertaken. This study contributes to the discussion about the evolution of professionalism within the context of increased pressures on staff arising from cuts and strains on the present teaching qualification system...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} driven by two {{separate}} but interrelated issues. First, it {{is driven by}} the desire to explore the effectiveness of assistive technologies in the structure of professional development of <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers.</b> Second, it seeks to explore the extent to which such technologies, as reflected in the use of digital recordings in the process of self-reflection by <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers,</b> can contribute to the promotion of a dialogic (Alexander, 2008) and cooperative (Edge 1992, 2002 and 2006) approaches in the use of feedback for the development of <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers</b> with a focus on problem solving. The anchor for this exploration is the desire {{to move away from the}} teacher (educator) –centred role (Copland 2010) that is prevalent in the use of feedback in contemporary teacher training programmes. The study surveyed the views of <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers</b> in two colleges through the use of a questionnaire and through a focus group discussion in consonance with the integrative approach to action research which acknowledges the importance of the voice of the third person (Coghlan and Brannick, 2010). The findings were subjected to both qualitative and quantitative analysis, the former through the use of the SPSS statistical analysis tool and the latter through an ethno-linguistic approach (Copland 2010). The study found that in the views of <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers</b> (third person), the use of assistive technologies can significantly facilitate the promotion of the dialogic/cooperative approaches to giving and using feedback in the professional development of <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers</b> if certain conditions were met. The study concluded that while these approaches are highly desired by <b>trainee</b> <b>teachers</b> who see them as more helpful than the prevalent teacher-centred approach, there is the need to develop a conceptual framework for its implementation...|$|R
