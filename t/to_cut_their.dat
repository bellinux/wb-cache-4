5|$|Afghanistan did {{not send}} any {{delegation}} to the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand, due to economic difficulties. Laws implemented by the Taliban government also {{made it impossible for}} Afghan athletes to compete. For example, the International Boxing Association (AIBA) does not allow players to have beards and mustaches, but Afghan males were forbidden <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> facial hair. Afghanistan returned to the Asian Games {{after the fall of the}} Taliban government in the midst of ongoing war. In June 2003, the IOC lifted the suspension imposed on Afghanistan during the 115th IOC Session in Prague.|$|E

5|$|City {{missed out}} on {{promotion}} {{and as a result}} had <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> wage budget. However, Colbeck, whose contract had expired, was offered a new three-year deal on improved terms. He turned down the offer and stayed at the club on a week-to-week basis on his previous terms. He was watched in a pre-season friendly playing for City against Bradford Park Avenue by his former Darlington boss Dave Penney, who had since been appointed Oldham Athletic manager. Colbeck started the season with Bradford and played another five games, bringing his total to the club to 109, of which 41 were as substitute.|$|E

Batman's train was painted red so that Robin could use it, because Robin's train was damaged during a previous incident. The Robin side re-opened on April 7 and ran until June 28 when it was closed {{for the rest of the}} year. The Batman side did not operate at all, but three of the five cars from the original Robin train were placed on Batman's maintenance track.

5|$|Pliny the Elder in his Natural History and Varro related {{that the}} Romans {{did not begin}} <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> hair short until barbers were {{introduced}} to Italy from Sicily by P. Ticinius Mena in 299 BC. Women in Roman times valued long hair, usually with a center part. Apart from in the earliest times, men's hair was usually shorter than women's, although other cultures of the time, such as Greeks in the east, considered long hair to be typical of philosophers, who {{were thought to be}} too engrossed in learning to bother with hair. Strictly in the province of Rome, however, the shorter hairstyle was especially popular. When Julius Caesar conquered the Gauls, who favored long hair, he ordered it to be cut short.|$|E
5|$|The {{teaching}} of Eskayan in the volunteer schools {{is one of}} the few remaining cultural practices of the Eskaya community. Formerly, Eskaya men would wear shirts made of piña raffia with a Chinese-style collar, black breeches, and cotton berets. Women wore piña dresses with bulging sleeves similar to the Spanish-influenced Boholano style (mostly in Biabas) and covered their hair with cotton habits (mostly in Taytay). Traditionally, women were not permitted <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> hair short nor wear trousers, and drinking and dancing were universally prohibited. For the most part these customs have been discontinued, however traditional dress is sometimes worn on Sundays and special occasions.|$|E

5|$|Baleen whales {{continue}} to be harvested. However, only three nations take whales: Iceland, Norway, and Japan. All these nations {{are part of the}} IWC, with Norway and Iceland rejecting the moratorium and continuing commercial whaling. Japan, being part of the IWC, whales under the Scientific Permit stated in Article VIII in the Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, which allows the taking of whales for scientific research. Japan has had two main research programs: the Joint Aquatic Resources Permit Application (JARPA) and the Japanese Research Program in the North (JARPN). JARPN is focused in the North Pacific and JARPA around the Antarctic. JARPA mainly caught Antarctic minke whales, catching nearly 7,000; to a far lesser extent, they also caught fin whales. Animal-rights activist groups, such as the Greenpeace, object to Japan's scientific whaling, with some calling it a substitute for commercial whaling. In 2014, the International Court of Justice (the UN judicial branch) banned the taking of whales for any purpose in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary; however, Japan refuses to stop whaling and has only promised <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> annual catches by a third (around 300 whales per year).|$|E
5|$|By 1989, {{the airline}} had 156 {{employees}} and 150,000 annual passengers. On 9 February 1989, Norsk Air's board {{decided to start}} the termination process if a sale was not made. The employees agreed <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> wages 10 percent and not take sick days during the sales process. One of the main difficulties in the sales process was that Widerøe {{could not afford to}} purchase Norsk Air's hangar at the airport. Widerøe intended to continue operations at both Torp and Geiteryggen for a year to see where to establish its base. In fear that the airline would move to Skien, the municipalities of Sandefjord and Stokke, who owned the majority of the airport, agreed to purchase the hangar, which had been built for NOK20 million in 1987, for NOK11.5 million. Half the hangar would be rented to Widerøe for NOK500,000 per year. This was insufficient to cover the NOK1.2 million in annual interest costs.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{followed}} in Vanguard, bringing {{the next two}} ships into action with the starboard side of the French van, catching the French ships in a crossfire that rapidly battered and dismasted the ships, despite determined defence. As the French van was destroyed, HMS Bellerophon and HMS Majestic attacked the French centre. Outnumbered and faced with the massed broadsides of Orient and the 80-gun Franklin and Tonnant, both British ships suffered massive damage. Culloden, {{bringing up the rear}} of the British line, passed too close to the northern shoal and grounded, Troubridge suffering severe damage to his hull despite efforts by Mutine and Leander to drag the ship off. By 19:00 darkness had fallen, and within an hour the French van had been defeated, Guerrier, Conquérant, Spartiate, Aquilon and Peuple Souverain all either in British hands or too badly damaged to continue fighting. The British too had suffered damage, with Vanguard and Goliath badly hit while to the south both Bellerophon and Majestic had been forced <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> anchor cables and pull away from their respective opponents. Bellerophon had been dismasted, Majestics captain George Blagden Westcott had been killed, and on Vanguard Nelson had suffered a severe head wound.|$|E

5|$|Saumarez {{ordered his}} squadron's boats to assist Hannibal and Pompée, {{both of which}} were trapped under heavy fire and unable to {{effectively}} respond. As he did so, Linois ordered his ships <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> anchor cables and drift into the shallows, away from the becalmed British squadron. Formidable successfully completed the manoeuvre, but both Desaix and Indomptable grounded inshore, where they were exposed to heavy fire from Saumarez's ships, which had also cut their cables in an effort to close with their opponents. At 13:35 however, Saumarez recognised that his squadron was in danger of grounding directly under the fire of the Spanish batteries. With the squadron's boats either sunk or employed towing Pompée back to Gibraltar, there was no possibility of launching an amphibious operation against the Spanish forts and Saumarez reluctantly called the attack off, the remainder of the squadron retiring to Gibratar but leaving the stranded Hannibal in the Bay of Gibraltar.|$|E
5|$|Temple Owls {{started their}} {{season with a}} 62–56 home win against Seton Hall Pirates on November 12. Seton Hall last led with 8:15 in the first half, off a Herb Pope jump shot to make the score 20–17. The Owls went on a 17–0 run to close the half. They led by up to 16 with 4 minutes and 16seconds left in the game, but Seton Hall scored the next 12 points <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> deficit to four. Despite {{retaining}} most of their players from the 2009-2010 season, when they were the eighth-highest scoring team in Division I at 80.1 points per game, Seton Hall was held to 30 percent shooting by Temple Owls' defense. Juan Fernandez led Temple Owls with 12 points, and Rahlir Jefferson recorded his first double-double at 10 points and 10 rebounds. Owls player Lavoy Allen sat out much of the game with foul trouble. The Owls won their next game against Toledo 82–49. All five starters scored above nine, and Micheal Eric was the highest scorer, with 14 points.|$|E
5|$|The Falcons won {{the coin}} toss {{before the game}} and elected to receive the opening kickoff. They drove down the field and scored first on a five-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Jamal Anderson. On the next drive, the Vikings answered the score with a 31-yard touchdown pass from Cunningham to Moss, tying the game at 7. Neither team scored {{in the remainder of}} the first quarter. In the second quarter, Gary Anderson kicked a field goal after the Vikings recovered a Falcons fumble to make the score 10–7. After forcing the Falcons to punt on the next drive, the Vikings scored another touchdown on a one-yard run by Cunningham, increasing the lead to 17–7 with five minutes remaining in the first half. The Falcons then lost another fumble, which gave possession back to the Vikings. On the ensuing drive, Moss dropped what would have been a touchdown pass in the end zone, leaving Gary Anderson to kick another field goal to make the score 20–7. After forcing another Falcons punt, the Vikings attempted to increase their lead before halftime, but Falcons lineman Chuck Smith forced a fumble on Cunningham, and the Falcons recovered the ball deep in Vikings territory. The Falcons subsequently scored on a 14-yard touchdown pass from Chris Chandler to Terance Mathis <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> deficit to 20–14 {{by the end of the}} half.|$|E

5|$|The Trojans next {{traveled}} to face rivals, the California Golden Bears, led by fourth–year head coach Jeff Tedford and quarterback Joe Ayoob. Although the Bears handed the Trojans their last loss in 2003, they were struggling in the season, having lost {{three out of}} the last four games and dropping out of the rankings {{for the first time since}} 2003. The Trojans scored first after Ayoob's first of four interceptions in the game, on a LenDale White rush. Ayoob recovered after the interception, and led the Bears to a field goal <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> deficit to four at the end of the first quarter. In the second quarter, Leinart rushed for a pair of touchdowns to give the Trojans a 21–3 lead at half-time. After a pair of White rushing touchdowns, the Bears scored again on a Chris Manerino rush that ended scoring in the game, with the Trojans winning 35–10. With the win, the Trojans clinched at least a share of the Pac-10 title and increased their winning streak to 32games, tied for the sixthlongest in history.|$|E
5|$|The {{diversion}} {{of the boats}} to Pompée prevented Saumarez from launching a planned amphibious assault against Isla Verda with the squadron's Marines, and in the fitful breeze, both Caesar and Audacious were beginning to drift dangerously close to the shoals around the island: if they grounded, then they would share Hannibals fate {{directly in front of}} the island's batteries. Observing the failure of his planned attack on the French squadron, Saumarez raised the signal at 13:35 for his ships to withdraw to Gibraltar. Pompée was already well on the way thanks to the towing boats, and Caesar and Audacious were able <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> remaining anchors and limp out of the bay with the assistance of a sudden land breeze that carried them rapidly out of reach of the French and Spanish guns. They were joined by Venerable and Spencer as they left, the battered squadron retiring to Gibraltar leaving the almost dismasted hulk of Hannibal grounded in Algeciras harbour.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} possession, Harp changed Jayhawks' defense to a mantoman. The change in defense caused the Tar Heels {{to become more}} active on offense with several screens and movement on offense. The possession resulted in an off the ball foul that sent Rosenbluth to the free throw line where he made both shots. Kansas pushed the ball up the court quickly with King, who took an eight-foot shot and Carolina collected the rebound and continued to slow the tempo in the half court as Kansas shifted back into a 23 zone. The Tar Heels passed the ball back and forth until the Jayhawks broke from their zone and went into a mantoman again. Kearns made a close quarters shot in the paint. Kansas stepped up their defense {{at the behest of}} coach Harp and held Carolina scoreless for two minutes. During the period, Kansas made four free throws <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> deficit to two points, with the score being 1917. The Tar Heels continued to slow the pace and work the ball around to get the open shot, while the Jayhawks would rush up the court and attempt to give the ball to Chamberlain before taking a poor shot. This resulted in moderate success for both teams as North Carolina scored eight points to Kansas' three before the final two minutes began. In the closing two minutes, the two teams would both score two free throws to bring the score to 2922 in favor of North Carolina.|$|E

5|$|That night, the Japanese made a minor {{attack against}} 'C' Company, {{but this was}} turned back with {{artillery}} and small arms. The following day the Australians resumed their attack. In doing so, McKinna ordered 'D' Company to renew the assault, aiming for Pear Hill, on the right hand side of the Australian line. Although it required a more physically draining approach march over Artillery Hill and through dense scrub, the tactic {{proved to be more}} successful than the previous day's efforts. Pear Hill was joined by a narrow razorback ridge that limited the Australian frontage to just three men side-by-side, who had <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> way through the thick bamboo with machetes. Weighed down with full marching order and heavy weapons, including Vickers machine guns, the Australians found it heavy going. It took the majority of the afternoon to reach {{the crest of the hill}} where they were to form up for the final assault. A thirty-minute pause followed, after which an artillery barrage was called down upon the Japanese defenders. On their right, 'A' Company, began to draw the Japanese fire and at 15:30 hours 'D' Company attacked the ridge, across a thin saddle. By late afternoon, the Japanese defenders had pulled back from the ridge, leaving the Australians in possession of it after heavy fighting with 'D' Company securing the main position, while 'B' Company skirted north of Barton's Knoll and secured a secondary position below the ridge, which the Australians dubbed Baker's Brow. Meanwhile, on the Australian left—the western side of the battlefield—a Juki heavy machine and snipers held up 'C' Company's advance.|$|E
5|$|The Trojans next {{visited the}} Washington Huskies, led by first–year head coach Tyrone Willingham and quarterback Isaiah Stanback. The Huskies took an early lead {{on a field}} goal, but the Trojans {{answered}} with a Leinart touchdown pass to Steve Smith. Stanback threw his only touchdown of the game late in the quarter to give the Huskies a 10–7 lead, but the Trojans took the lead for good {{less than a minute}} later with Leinart's second touchdown pass of the day. A minute into the second quarter Reggie Bush ran for a touchdown, and, after a failed extra point attempt and the Huskies offense unable to move the ball, two minutes later returned a punt 84yards for a touchdown. After another failed drive for the Huskies and another twominutes, Leinart threw his third touchdown of the game to give the Trojans a 34–10 lead. Stanback rushed for a touchdown with twominutes remaining before half-time <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>their</b> deficit in half, but Mario Danelo kicked a field goal as time expired to give the Trojans a 37–17 lead at half-time. In the third quarter, Leinart threw his fourth touchdown of the game before he was replaced by backup Booty. A Booty interception, that was returned 76yards by Dashon Goldson, gave the Huskies their last score of the game, and Booty's touchdown pass to Patrick Turner proved to be the final score in the game, giving the Trojans a 51–24 win. With the win the Trojans extended their winning streak to 29games.|$|E
