500|$|In her Street Fighter V incarnation, Ibuki's playstyle is {{different}} than in Street Fighter IV, becoming a [...] "resource-heavy" [...] character. She has gained new special moves such as to dodge-teleport, glide, and throw bombs with different fuses, making her even more distracting and unpredicatble. According to Capcom, [...] "Ibuki {{has always been a}} very mobile character with various target combos, but she now has even more ways to mix-up the opponent with the ability to glide through the air and <b>toss</b> <b>out</b> ninja bombs, making it very difficult to predict where she will land and where her next attack will come from. Kunais have also been a cornerstone of her playstyle, but now players will have to be much more strategic in their use as she can only stock five at a time before she has to quickly obtain another set." ...|$|E
500|$|Insane Clown Posse {{is known}} for their {{elaborate}} concert performances. In Marley Brant's Tales from the Rock 'n' Roll Highway, Bruce described a typical performance: [...] "We <b>toss</b> <b>out,</b> kick out, and shoot out into the crowd about three to four hundred two-liters of Faygo at every show...We bring with us monsters, dancing clowns, girls, trampolines, and pure and absolute madness to the stage...Shaggy and I know that without all that crazy shit going on around us, we'd just be two more idiots walking back and forth, rapping on stage...ICP's motto has always been 'Fuck keepin' it real: we just keep it entertaining.'" [...] Performances feature backdrops including, among other settings, a game show set and a cemetery. Bruce stated, [...] "We always have a different set, not only for Hallowicked but every tour we go out on. We've been around so long that we get to dig up the many cool sets that we used {{back in the day}} and then get to use them again on a national level. Something we might've done once in '94 at St. Andrew's Hall, we can go back again and now do it nationwide-style".|$|E

6000|$|Probably {{the troops}} who fish our Border-burns still manage to <b>toss</b> <b>out</b> some dozens of tiny fishes, some {{six or eight}} to the pound. Are not these triumphs chronicled in the [...] "Scotsman?" [...] But they cannot imagine what angling was in the dead years, nor what great trout dwelt below the linns of the Crosscleugh burn, beneath the red {{clusters}} of the rowan trees, or {{in the waters of}} the [...] "Little Yarrow" [...] above the Loch of the Lowes. As to the lochs themselves, now that anyone may put a boat on them, now that there is perpetual trolling, as well as fly-fishing, so that every fish knows the lures, the fun is mainly over. In April, no doubt, something may still be done, and in the silver twilights of June, when as you drift on the still surface you hear the constant sweet plash of the rising trout, a few, and these good, may be taken. But the water wants re-stocking, and the burns in winter need watching, in the interests of spawning fish. It is nobody's interest, that I know of, to take trouble and incur expense; and free fishing, by the constitution of the universe, must end in bad fishing or in none at all. The best we can say for it is that vast numbers of persons may, by the still waters of these meres, enjoy the pleasures of hope. Even solitude is no longer {{to be found in the}} scene which Scott, in [...] "Marmion," [...] chooses as of all places the most solitary.|$|E

Knowing that each of their captives is enormously wealthy, they demand a ransom from each captive personally.

5000|$|In the 1920s Charlotte, an American painter, arrives from Boston on {{the island}} of Alaya to visit her father, U. S. Navy Captain Bruckner, whom she hasn't seen in quite some time. Bruckner is the U.S. Congress-sanctioned {{governor}} of the island. He rules with a stern, patrician, and thoroughly patronizing attitude towards the natives. Charlotte is somewhat taken aback by her father's rigid adherence to the law. She tries to intervene on behalf of Bruckner's charge/houseboy Matangi, who plans to get Bruckner to <b>toss</b> <b>out</b> a harsh penalty issued to a native man who stole a boat [...] "for love."

From November 1997 to May 1999 the money passed through an account at the Safra National Bank of New York and was secretly controlled by Maluf. This indictment was maintained by a New York judge on April 25, 2012, who dismissed a petition from the Malufs, Paulo and Flávio, who sought a court order to <b>toss</b> <b>out</b> the indictment.|$|E

Berlin could help raise the $35,000 needed for its construction. Berlin's song, [...] "Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning," [...] an everyman song for soldiers, would be the basis of a revue full of army recruits—a veritable source of manpower available for him to use. He called for his friend and co-worker Harry Ruby to join him in writing down the flurry of songs that Berlin would create, including [...] "God Bless America," [...] which Berlin would eventually <b>toss</b> <b>out</b> of the play for being too sticky.|$|E
50|$|Infanticide {{has been}} {{extensively}} studied in vertebrates such as hanuman langurs, big cats, house sparrows and mice. However, this behavior also occurs in the invertebrates. For example, in the spider Stegodyphus lineatus, males invade female nests and <b>toss</b> <b>out</b> their egg sacs. Females only have one clutch in their lifetime, and experience reduced reproductive success if the clutch is lost. This results in vicious battles where injury and even death can occur. Jacana jacana, a tropical wading bird, {{provides an example of}} infanticide by the female sex. Females guard a territory while males care for their young. As males are a limited resource, other females will commonly displace or kill their young. Males can then mate again and care for the young of the new female.|$|E
50|$|Each episode follows 'Allan' {{shown as}} a clever business-minded person, {{coming up with}} some nasty and immoral tricks to earn fast money. He used to use 'Nanha' as his stooge. He himself was not {{inclined}} to work and would rather be the sleeping partner in every saga or telling the tricks to poor Nanha (his front man). The character of Nanha became an instant hit. He was shown to be an innocent, funny and somewhat dumb-looking person from a rural area who loved his country and would dream of earning an honest living. He didn't know the norms of the new society and was therefore used by Allan as the 'front man' for his tricks. In the end, he would unintentionally <b>toss</b> <b>out</b> the whole plot of Allan by speaking the truth to the public. This PTV series was aired in 1981-82.|$|E

[...] Adam Burling of musicOMH exclaimed, [...] "Christmas does funny things to people. Even pop groups as reliably excellent at singles as Girls Aloud <b>toss</b> <b>out</b> pointless, lazy covers in a ruthless attempt to snare that coveted seasonal chart-topper from the X-Factor's clutches." [...] A BBC Music review of The Sound of Girls Aloud chose to [...] "ignore the Xmas party cover". Yahoo! Music stated [...] "the karaoke renditions of ... Tiffany's 'I Think We're Alone Now' really drag this collection down".

Kyle's speech went over extremely well, and it seemed Kyle was a shoo-in for victory, but when Kyle discovered a strange metallic device in his backpack, and read more of Baylin's journal, he realized how dangerous being in the spotlight had become.
