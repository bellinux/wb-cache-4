40|$|VDI type- 1 rig and JIS <b>rig</b> are the <b>two</b> major testing <b>rigs</b> for cleanable fabric filters. We {{measured}} the filter cleaning performance using these rigs {{and the results}} were compared in order to characterize the two testing methods. The filter performance tests showed that the filter cleaning efficiency measured with VDI type- 1 rig is higher than that with JIS rig. During pulse jet cleaning, JIS rig gave a higher peak pressure and a shorter time period of pulse jet compared to VDI type- 1 rig. A new filtration model was applied to the filtration cycles with the <b>two</b> <b>rigs</b> and it was shown that the difference in filter cleaning performance measured by VDI type- 1 and JIS rigs can be expressed in terms of the surface cleaning fraction, which is the ratio of cleaned surface area to the total surface area of a filter, and the residual dust load on the un-cleaned surface after cleaning. © 2007...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an experimental and theoretical study of natural convection heat transfer from a downwardfacing constant-heat-flux inclined flat plate in water. The theoretical investigation, which comprised {{an analysis of}} the integrated boundary layer equations for steady two-dimensional laminar and turbulent flows, produced analytical solutions for a heated plate inclined at any angle of inclination. Experiments, using <b>two</b> <b>rigs,</b> investigated heat transfer in the laminar, transition and turbulent regimes. The major outcome is a correlation for the local Nusselt Number over a range of modified Rayleigh Number from 10 6 to 10 15. In addition, boundary layer temperature and velocity profiles were measured using traversing probes and the flow outside the boundary layer was investigated using flow visualization techniques...|$|R
