6000|$|Ans. No marvel, for it {{was their}} work, not to search the deep things of God, but those which be the things of a man, and to {{discourse}} of that righteousness, and principle of holiness, which was naturally founded, and found within themselves, as men; or, as you say, 'as creatures possessed with a mind and reason.' But as I have already shewed, all this may be, where the Holy Ghost and faith is absent, even by the dictates, as you call them, of human nature; a principle, and actions, when trusted to that, as much please the devil, as any wickedness that is committed by the sons of men. I should not have thus boldly inserted it, but that yourself did tell me of it (p. 101). But I believe it was only extorted from you; your judgment, and your Apollo, suit not here, though indeed <b>the</b> <b>devil</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right; for this righteousness and holiness which is our own, and of ourselves, is the greatest enemy to Jesus Christ: the post against his post, and the wall against his wall.

60|$|The first Candle {{that was}} relighted (as is usual in such Cases) burn'd dim and dull {{for a good}} while, and the other being out, the Room was much darker than before, and a Wench that stood by the Ladies Table, bawls out to her Mistress, Law Madam! the Candles burn blue; an old Lady that sat by says, ay Betty! so they do; upon {{this one of the}} Ladies starts up, Mercy upon us, says she, what is the Matter! In this unlucky Moment another Servant, without Orders, went to the great Peer Sconce, and because, as he thought, he would be sure to snuff the Candle well, he offers to take it down, but very unhappily, I say, the Hook came out and down falls the Sconce Candle and all, and the Looking-Glass broke all to pieces, with a horrible Noise; however, the Candle falling out of the Sconce did not go out, but lay on the Floor burning dully, and as it is usual on such Cases, all on one Side, Betty cries out again, Law Madam, that Candle burns blue too; the very Moment she said this, the Footman that had thrown down the Sconce, says to his fellow Servant, that came to his Assistance, I think <b>the</b> <b>Devil</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Candles to Night, and away he run out of the Room, for fear of his Master.|$|E

The music, including <b>The</b> <b>Devil</b> <b>Is</b> <b>In</b> <b>The</b> Beats and <b>The</b> <b>Devil</b> <b>Is</b> <b>In</b> <b>The</b> Details, underscores the movie's style, recalling Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange with musical motifs consistent with Wright's [...] "fairy tale theme" [...] of childhood innocence confronting the modern [...] "synthetic" [...] world. Several reviewers have commented that the movie has a hyper-stylized Kubrickian tone, reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange. The [...] "Kubrick-esque" [...] style includes Isaacs' [...] "gleeful sadism... at times darkly comedic," [...] a whistling villain reminiscent of Alex DeLarge. Joe Wright's [...] "love of fairy tales and David Lynch movies" [...] was seen as blending A Clockwork Orange [...] and the work of the Brothers Grimm.|$|E

50|$|Per the {{introduction}} by Levine for The Historical Jesus in Context;There {{is a consensus}} of sorts on a basic outline of Jesus’ life.
