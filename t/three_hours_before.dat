5|$|According to an unquoted {{source in}} The Outlaw Bible of American Literature, on June 3, 1968, at 9:00am, Solanas {{arrived at the}} Chelsea Hotel, where Girodias lived. She asked {{for him at the}} desk but was told he was gone for the weekend. She {{remained}} for <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> heading to the Grove Press, where she asked for Barney Rosset, who was also not available.|$|E
5|$|As part of Commodore Richard Dale's Mediterranean Squadron, Enterprise {{had been}} {{deployed}} with the American force blockading the Vilayet of Tripoli. Enterprise, {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Andrew Sterett, had been sent by Commodore Dale to gather supplies at Malta. While cruising towards Malta, Enterprise engaged Tripoli, commanded by Admiral Rais Mahomet Rous. Tripoli put up a stubborn fight, and the engagement lasted for <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> the polacca was finally captured by the Americans.|$|E

5|$|Murray {{reached the}} quarterfinals at the BNP Paribas Masters losing to Gaël Monfils in three sets. Combined with his exit and Söderling's taking the title, Murray found himself pushed down {{a spot in}} the rankings, to No. 5 from No. 4. At the Tour finals in London, Murray went 2–1 in round robin play before facing Nadal in the semifinal. They battled for over <b>three</b> <b>hours,</b> <b>before</b> Murray fell to the Spaniard in a final-set tie-breaker, {{bringing}} an end to his season.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm formed, {{officials}} in Galveston County, Texas issued a voluntary evacuation for {{the western end of}} Galveston Island, as the area was not protected by the Galveston Seawall. The ferry from the island to the Bolivar Peninsula was closed, while voluntary evacuations were issued in Surfside in Brazoria County. Voluntary evacuations were also suggested near Sabine Pass in Jefferson County, Texas, though few left. Also, when the National Hurricane Center issued the first advisory on Allison, officials issued Tropical Storm Warnings from Sargent, Texas to Morgan City, Louisiana, just <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> tropical storm winds were observed.|$|E
5|$|Post-production work on {{the episode}} was {{finished}} by May 1993, with {{the final version of}} the episode being assembled only <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> its preview screening for the network's executives. Stock footage of the exterior of the J. Edgar Hoover Building was added to the episode, although later episodes would film new exterior shots using Simon Fraser University as a stand-in location. The climactic abduction scene featuring Billy Miles in a forest clearing featured a swirling vortex of leaves created using computer imagery by the series' visual designer Mat Beck; which Carter has described as being more complicated to achieve than the Normandy landings.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of {{caffeine}} on some cardiovascular factors and endurance exercises in male student athletes. Thus, 45 subjects with an average age of 20 - 28, height of 163. 4 - 182. 5 centimetres, and weight of 59. 9 - 73. 9 kg were matched into three groups as follows: experimental (1) Taking caffeine one <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> exercise (OHBE), experimental (2) taking caffeine <b>three</b> <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> exercise (THBE), and control group taking placebo. Descriptive statistic and One-Way Analysis of variance, dependent t, and follow-up Tukey test at (p= 0. 05) were used to analyze data. The results showed that there were a significant difference between heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), blood glucose (BG) and time of endurance performance (TEP) in experimental groups and control group...|$|R

5|$|Marseille {{tried to}} radio his {{position}} but {{was forced to}} bail out over the sea. He paddled around in the water for <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> being rescued by a Heinkel He 59 float plane based at Schellingwoude. Severely worn out and suffering from exposure, {{he was sent to}} a field hospital. I.(Jagd)/LG 2 claimed three aerial victories for the loss of four Bf 109s that day. Marseille was in serious trouble when arriving back at the airfield. He had abandoned his leader Staffelkapitän Adolf Buhl, who was shot down and killed. He received a stern rebuke and final warning from Herbert Ihlefeld, during which he tore up his flight evaluations with a visibly upset Marseille looking on. Other pilots were voicing their dissent concerning Marseille. Because of his alienation of other pilots, his arrogant and unapologetic nature, Ihlefeld would eventually dismiss Marseille from LG 2.|$|E
5|$|Rain hit {{the circuit}} on Saturday afternoon, ending <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> the session started, {{resulting}} in several damp patches {{on the circuit}} though the air temperature remained hot. Different sections of the circuit dried out at different rates {{making it difficult for}} drivers to tell precisely how wet or dry certain corners were. The teams ran intermediate tyres before switching to the super-soft tyre as the session progressed. Some drivers ran deep into turn five. Vettel was the fastest driver of the session with a time of 1:48.028 set in the last twenty minutes of the one-hour period. The time was four-tenths faster than championship rival Alonso. Hamilton was third fastest, two-thousandths of a second in front of Massa. Rosberg was fifth, ahead of Webber and Nico Hülkenberg. Kubica, Sutil and Buemi completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Hispania Racing driver Bruno Senna's right-rear tyre got onto a white line at the Singapore Sling chicane and spun. Senna later brushed a wall entering the Esplanade Bridge in the final minute and stopped his car, causing the yellow-flags to be shown; drivers were unable to improve on their lap times because of the limited time available.|$|E
5|$|The pre-Rick {{tropical}} depression {{was a threat}} to Mexico. Hours before upgrading, Mexican officials issued a tropical storm watch for the area between Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán and Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. <b>Three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> Rick was upgraded to a hurricane, the watch was upgraded to a warning and a hurricane watch was issued and shortly afterward raised to a warning. On November 9, the hurricane warning was extended to Zihuatanejo and Huatulco; warnings for areas west of Zihuatanejo and Lázaro Cárdenas were dropped at the same time. However, warnings for areas west of and including Acapulco remained until lifted three hours later. On November 10, warnings were extended from Punta Maldonado to Tapachula; all warnings west of Punta Maldonado were dropped at that time. Then, Mexico's Interior Ministry {{declared a state of emergency}} along the Oaxaca coast. Six hours later, the warnings were downgraded to tropical storm warnings. These warnings remained until they were dropped when Rick was downgraded to a depression.|$|E

Grayling described the historical novel as a [...] "remarkable love story {{as well as a}} story about human suffering and comradeship".|$|R
5|$|One {{accident}} at the Mousetrap, a complex interchange, had national ramifications. On August 1, 1984, a truck carrying six torpedoes for the U.S. Navy overturned. The situation was made worse {{as no one}} answered at the phone number provided with the cargo, and an unknown liquid was leaking {{from one of the}} torpedoes. It took more than <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> any military personnel arrived on the scene, U.S. Army personnel from a nearby base. The incident left thousands of cars stranded and Denver's transportation network paralyzed for about eight hours. Approximately 50 residents in the area were evacuated. Investigations later revealed that the truck driver did not follow a recommended route provided by state troopers, who specifically warned the driver to avoid the Mousetrap. The Navy promised reforms after being criticized for providing an unstaffed phone number with a hazardous cargo shipment, a violation of federal law, and failing to notify Denver officials about the shipment. The Mousetrap was grandfathered into the Interstate Highway system, with some structures built in 1951. The incident provided momentum to rebuild the interchange with a more modern and safer design. Construction began in several phases in 1987 and the last bridge was dedicated in 2003.|$|E
5|$|On September16, strong waves {{produced}} by the hurricane disabled the Swedish freighter Laponia, {{which at the time}} was located 300mi (480km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The ship was initially en route for Rio de Janeiro carrying cargo for the Bethlehem Steel Company. As a result of the stranded ship, the SS President Roosevelt was forced to divert its course in order to render aid. The United States Coast Guard cutters USCGC Sebago (WHEC-42) and USCGC Carrabasset (WAT-55) were sent from the Virginia Capes in order to provide assistance. In addition, a coast guard plane was dispatched from Elizabeth City, North Carolina. The ships remained on standby to monitor the Laponia for <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> conditions were considered safe to tow the stricken ship back to shore. Two fishing vessels capsized off Barnegat and Edgemere, New York, with both incidents resulting in a fatality. A cabin cruiser was sent to rescue occupants of the capsized boat off Edgemere, though it was also disrupted by rough seas. The ship was later able to rescue the other surviving crew members. Numerous other small craft off Long Island signaled distress calls to the US Coast Guard due to strong waves offshore. Eventually passing east of New England, the storm's large size resulted in heavy rainfall near Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. A weather station on the island reported maximum sustained winds of 45mph (70km/h). In Eastport, Maine, a weather station recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 993mbar (hPa; 29.33inHg) and wind speeds of 33mph (53km/h). In Maine, power lines were downed, damaging communications. In Bar Harbor, strong winds caused five fires, which were later extinguished. The schooner George Dresser ran aground on the port's coast. The hurricane also produced slight snowfalls in northern areas of the state.|$|E
25|$|At least 23 {{people were}} hospitalized in {{facilities}} in Samara and nearby Tolyatti, six {{of whom were}} in serious condition.

25|$|Cole later {{expanded}} his production {{to create an}} entire CD's worth of instrumentals, and traveled to Roc the Mic Studio, hoping to play it for Jay Z {{while he was in}} recording sessions for American Gangster.

25|$|Approximately <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> the {{scheduled}} race start {{it was announced}} Nick Heidfeld would be starting the race from the pitlane, after his team discovered insufficient ballast had been fitted to his car. This promoted all the cars behind him one position on the grid, significantly moving both the Brawn cars onto the 'clean' side of the starting grid, on the racing line.|$|E
25|$|Rodger {{began his}} attacks at his {{apartment}} on Seville Road, where three men were found dead inside. Each victim had received multiple stab wounds, and all had been killed approximately <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> the shooting spree. Their bodies were found the day following the shootings. They were identified as Rodger's roommates, Weihan Wang and Cheng Hong, and a friend named George Chen.|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh yes!” said Harper, {{pointing}} to the mainsail which lay loose beneath the big boom that swung, banging a little, above them. “It’s there ready. Still, it will be ’most <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> yet <b>before</b> there’s water in, and if the gunboat came along I’d sooner be here, where I’ve room to run, than jammed right up between her and a lee shore. If I was sure that was the high ground behind Point Sparto I’d feel considerably happier.” ...|$|R

60|$|It was {{now nearly}} nine o'clock, and, of course, <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> {{remained}} <b>before</b> {{the time of}} embarkation would arrive. Rollo was not sorry for this, as he thought {{that there would be}} enough to amuse and occupy him all this time on and around the pier. His first duty, however, was to go and report himself to Mr. George as having returned from his walk. This he did. He found his uncle very busy in his room, writing his journal.|$|R
25|$|After final safety checks, {{the ground}} crew would {{fill up the}} second stage with liquid {{hydrogen}} (LH2) and liquid oxygen (LOX) fuel, and the crew, wearing all-purpose spacesuits, would enter the spacecraft <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> liftoff. Once they were locked in, and after all systems were cleared by controllers at both the Cape and Mission Control in Houston, the Ares I would then launch.|$|E

Afterwards, she regularly escorted convoys from New York to Key West and back again.|$|E
25|$|By now, it {{was clear}} that Foster's skill level was not high enough to win him {{membership}} in the union at the level the UFM wanted. On the evening of September 15, the 40-member UFM steering committee met in a public session for <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>before</b> 300 UFM members. The steering committee debated the test administration, grading of the test results, Foster's skills, and other issues. Despite jeers from the crowd, the steering committee voted overwhelmingly against further picketing.|$|E
60|$|The two Indians {{had already}} lain {{down by the}} fire. Tom was some time {{before he could get}} to sleep. The thought of the wild and unknown country he was about to enter, with its great game, its hidden gold treasures, its Indians and its dangers, so excited his {{imagination}} that, tired as he was with the long ride, two or <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> passed <b>before</b> he fell off to sleep. He was awoke by being shaken somewhat roughly by Jerry.|$|R

60|$|Black Dick had {{probably}} brought over some more jewels to dispose of, and that business would be transacted, before {{there would be}} any talk of other matters. It might be {{a quarter of an}} <b>hour</b> <b>before</b> they heard that he was an inmate of the house; then, when they went downstairs with the dealer, they would hear that he had gone out for a walk and would await his return, so that he had two or <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> at least <b>before</b> there would be any search.|$|R
