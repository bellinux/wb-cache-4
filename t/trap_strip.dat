Soredia of H. physodes were frequently deposited on the strips but thallus fragments were rare. More soredia were deposited on {{the upper and lower}} branches than on the trunk, few soredia were deposited {{on the underside of the}} branches. The total daily deposition of soredia on the tree was positively correlated with average daily wind speed. Dispersal downwind from the tree was studied with squares of adhesive contact paper pinned to boards and located at intervals up to 25 m from the tree.

The dispersal of soredia by wind from four individual thalli was studied over 10 successive days. Soredia were deposited from each thallus on each day mostly within 2 cm of the source. Higher wind speeds were necessary to dispersae soredia on days when the relative humidity was high. Soredia and thallus fragments were also dispersed by splash dispersal. More soredia were splashed furthest at a splash height of 90 cm. These results suggest that initial colonization of the tree by H. physodes may have occurred by wind-dispersed soredia.

The soredia were <b>trapped</b> on adhesive <b>strips</b> placed at various locations on a Prunus blireiana L. tree for 24 hr periods. A correlation matrix of the data from all three studies revealed a negative correlation between soredial deposition and relative humidity; and a positive correlation with rainfall and temperature. A multiple regression and forward stepwise regression analysis selected relative humidity as the most significant climatic variable, i. e. more soredia tended to be deposited when relative humidity was low. Analysis of individual studies by multiple regression revealed: (1) no significant relationships between soredial deposition and climate in Study A; (2) positive relationships with temperature and wind speed in Study B and (3) positive relationships with wind speed and rainfall in the summer/autumn months of Study C; in the winter months no relationships with climate were found because few soredia were deposited. The data suggest that in the field seasonal photoperiod differences combined with moderately high temperatures and high relative humidity may promote soredial formation and accumulation on thalli prior to soredia dispersal.

40|$|The {{evanescent}} field of an optical waveguide {{can be used}} to trap and propel microscopic particles. A 1 µm particle is <b>trapped</b> on a <b>strip</b> waveguide and propelled forward until it reaches a 10 µm gap at the centre of a loop, created by splitting the waveguide into two branches. According to simulations, the particle will be elevated 3 µm in the gap and be stably trapped {{in the middle of the}} gap. The goal of this thesis is to implement an algorithm that can track a spherical particle in three dimensions and verify the simulated results. Information about all three coordinates is found by using off-focus images, in which diffraction rings will appear around the particle. The x and y coordinates are determined by calculating the centre of the particle in each image. A linear relationship between the radius of the diffraction ring and the displacement along the z-axis (vertical) is exploited to determine the z coordinate. Prior to tracking, it is necessary to make a calibration series where the radius is found for known displacements along the z-axis. First, the algorithm was applied on a video of a trapped particle made with darkfield microscopy. That did not work, because of too much noise from the waveguides near the gap. Instead, fluorescence microscopy was used. Unfortunately, trapping within the gap was not achieved with the latter technique, but a video of a particle moving along the waveguide was analysed.

40|$|In On the Origin of Species, Darwin {{presented}} a revised creation narrative which contradicted and superseded the Judeo-Christian narrative in Genesis. His second significant text, The Descent of Man, reflects in its title the ideological and philosophical impact his ideas {{have had in}} reversing the anthropocentric assumptions of humanism. This research examines how Darwinian theories have been mediated by science writers and incorporated by literary critics and authors, with emphasis on the representation of Edenic archetypes and the renegotiation of hierarchical relationships between animal, human, and posthuman forms. The thesis {{is divided into two}} parts. Part One explores critical responses to Darwinism. In popular science writing, a renewed emphasis has emerged on the dominance of human nature over nurture, and human activities (including art and culture) have been explained in terms of their adaptive functions. In literary criticism, the new school of Literary Darwinism has begun reading texts as expressions of biological drives. Part Two uses a modified form of Literary Darwinism to analyse pairs of literary texts which negotiate the anxieties raised by the implications of Darwinian theory. The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896) and Brave New World (1932) express the fear that mad scientists might exploit their knowledge of evolutionary science to create new, genetically altered species whose freedoms are curtailed by their creators. As Darwinian evolution gained credence, later novels turned away from fear of the scientist and towards fear of the science. Works such as Lord of the Flies (1954) and Galapagos (1985) explore the notion of human as beast, depicting biological and/or societal ‘devolution’ scenarios in which humanistic higher reasoning loses ground to animalism. More recent novels have combined the fears of mad scientists and devolved humanity to imagine future societies in which the genetic alteration of humans is controlled and politicised. In Oryx and Crake (2003), one dangerous and errant mind genetically extinguishes the human race and creates, in its place, a race of naive and unsophisticated posthumans. And in Genesis (2006), the human race is merely something to be studied by a post-apocalyptic chimp-android hybrid species which is physically devolved, but sufficiently advanced intellectually to have conquered humanity. In all of these novels, the depictions of alternative and future societies run alongside re-envisionings of the ‘fall of man’. In their Darwinian updates of the Fall, authors imagine evolutionary biology to be the Tree of Knowledge from which their Adams and Eves eat. Their new societies thus become alternate (inverted) versions of Eden; however rather than the lost paradise of Genesis, these Darwinian Edens are prisons which leave residents <b>trapped</b> and <b>stripped</b> of their humanity...|$|R
40|$|Managing {{the impacts}} of erosion after forest {{harvesting}} requires knowledge of erosion sources; rates of sediment transport and storage; as well as losses from the system. We construct a tracer-based (137 Cs) sediment budget to quantify these parameters. The budget shows significant redistribution, storage and transport of sediment between landscape elements and identifies the snig tracks and log landings as the major impact sites in the catchment. Annual sediment losses from them were estimated to be 25 ± 11 and 101 ± 15 t ha− 1 year− 1, respectively, however, {{it is probable that}} most of this is due to mechanical displacement of soil at the time of harvesting. The budget showed greatest net transport of material occurring from snig tracks; representing some 11 ± 4 % of the 137 Cs budget. Of the latter amount, 18 %, 28 % and 43 % was accounted for within the cross banks, filter strip and General Harvest Area (GHA), respectively. The 137 Cs budget also showed the GHA to be a significant sediment <b>trap.</b> The filter <b>strip</b> played a fundamental role in the trapping of material generated from the snig tracks, the mass delivery to them from this source was calculated to be 1. 7 ± 0. 6 kg m 2 year− 1. Careful management of these remains critical. Overall we could account for 97 ± 10 % of 137 Cs. This retention suggests that (within errors) the overall runoff management system of dispersing flow (and sediment) from the highly compacted snig tracks, by cross banks, into the less compacted (and larger area) GHA and filter strips has effectively retained surface soil and sediment mobilised as a result of harvesting at this site.

40|$|The {{industrial}} use of biocatalysts is increasingly {{important in the}} production of e. g. pharmaceuticals, chemicals, fuels and foodstuffs. A successful biocatalytic process is dependent on many factors, such as the biocatalyst properties, the nature of the reaction, reactor type and downstream processing. This work is focused on two important issues: Immobilization of the biocatalyst and in situ product removal. Different methods were evaluated for immobilization of the biocatalyst, E. coli cells containing a recombinantly expressed ω-TA from A. citreus. It was found that flocculation with chitosan, enhanced by a pH adjustment, was a very simple and effective method, allowing high biocatalyst loading while maintaining good diffusion properties. The flocculated cells proved useful in both stirred tank and packed bed reactors. The process considered is the production of chiral amines, which are highly important building blocks in e. g. pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The use of ω-transaminases (ω-TAs) for the production of chiral amines has been a rapidly growing field of research during recent years. Asymmetric synthesis is the principally advantageous route because of the high theoretical yield without need for additional reaction steps. However, the equilibrium position is often unfavourable for the amine synthesis. Shifting the equilibrium is therefore a frequently addressed issue. A commonly studied model reaction, conversion of acetophenone to optically pure methylbenzylamine, was employed in this work, using isopropylamine (IPA) as the amine donor. In this work, in situ product removal was realized by using a supported liquid membrane (SLM). The SLM consisted of n-undecane present in the pores of a hollow fibre allowing three-phase extraction (aqueous : organic : aqueous). The bioreactor effluent was circulated on the one side of the membrane and an acidic stripping phase, capturing the amine product, on the other side. Selective extraction of the amine product, (S) -α-methylbenzylamine, was achieved due to its considerably higher hydrophobicity and its lower pKa value compared to IPA. Thus, similar concentrations of the two amines were extracted despite using a large excess of IPA to drive the reaction. A highly concentrated product, 98 g/l (810 mM), was obtained in 36 hours when using the SLM extraction system coupled to a stirred tank reactor. Ketones are not <b>trapped</b> in the <b>stripping</b> phase. Finally, parameters influencing the product extraction were investigated and discussed. The use of an SLM system was considered a valuable addition to other existing methods for improving ω-TA catalyzed asymmetric synthesis...|$|R
50|$|Mammoth Mogul - {{an ancient}} woolly mammoth {{who appears to}} have been {{inspired}} by such comic book villains as Vandal Savage and the Kingpin. Mogul was a primitive hunter who had a Chaos Emerald (which {{at one point in the}} series existed in numbers far greater than seven) embedded in his chest that granted him immortality and mystical abilities. He briefly conquered part of Mobius but was overthrown, and formed the evil Order of Ixis after learning to harness his magical energies. This group attempted to conquer the planet as well only to be defeated in a war with an ancient group of Echidnas, leaving only a handful of survivors besides Mogul; eventually this would produce Ixis Naugus. Mogul fell into obscurity over the centuries, all the while planning for future conquests. Towards the present day he began making plans, including imbuing his Fearsome Foursome and Mighty the Armadillo with enhanced physical abilities. He attempted to take over the planet by stealing the powers of the mighty Enerjak using the magical Sword of Acorns, but was defeated by the combined efforts of Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, the Ancient Walkers, and the Brotherhood of Guardians. This led to him being imprisoned in the newly created Master Emerald, from which he reached out and granted super-speed to a young girl named Mina Mongoose after determining that she would become someone whom Sonic would care about. He eventually escaped due to Dr. Eggman's machinations, and captured Tails to drain his power and launch an attack that fatally wounded the Ancient Walkers. A confrontation between him and Knuckles led to Knuckles' death and Mogul's theft of his Chaos powers, which he began using to destroy the multiverse before being thwarted by Tails, who reversed the damage he had done. He later escaped and reclaimed the Sword of Acorns and its magical twin, the Crown of Acorns, as well as being joined by Ixis Naugus. Again defeated and <b>trapped,</b> he was <b>stripped</b> of his Chaos Emerald and captured by the Freedom Fighters before managing to claim one of the newly created seven Chaos Emeralds by using mind control on Mighty, Mina, and Tails and forcing Sonic to give him the Emerald as ransom.

In Silver the Hedgehog's time, however, an aged Mammoth Mogul appeared to lament his former evil path, and mentored the young time traveler in his efforts to undo their horrific future.|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} part of this thesis, we present a {{nonlinear}} theory for the excitation of trapped wave around a circular cylinder mounted at the center of a channel. It is well-known that near an infinite linear array of periodically spaced cylinders trapped waves of certain eigen-frequencies can exist. If there are only a finite number of cylinders in an infinite sea, trapping is imperfect. Simple harmonic incident waves can excite a nearly trapped wave at one of the eigen-frequencies through a linear mechanism. However the maximum amplification ratio increases monotonically with the number of the cylinders, hence the solution is singular in the limit of infinitely many cylinders. A nonlinear theory is developed for the trapped waves excited subharmonically by an incident wave of twice the eigen-frequency. The effects of geometrical parameters on the initial growth of resonance and the final amplification are studied in detail. The nonlinear theory is further extend to random incident waves with a narrow spectrum centered near twice the natural frequency of the trapped wave. The effects of detuning and bandwidth of the spectrum are examined. In the second part of the thesis, we study the Bragg resonance of surface water waves by (i) a line of periodic circular cylinders in a long channel, and (ii) a two-dimensional periodic array of cylinders. (cont.) For case (i), strong reflection takes place in a channel when the cylinder spacing is one-half that of the incident waves. Solutions for a large but finite number of cylinders in a channel are examined and compared with finite element results. For case (ii) we study an array of cylinders extending in both horizontal directions toward infinity, the Bragg resonance condition is found to be the same as that in the physics of solid state and photonic crystals, and can be determined by Ewald construction. Envelope equations of Klein-Gordon type for resonated waves are derived for multiple resonated waves. For a wide strip of cylinders, analytical solutions of both two-wave and three-wave resonance are discussed in detail. We also extend the theory to include second-order nonlinear effects of the free surface. For a train of periodically modulated incident waves scattered by an one-dimensional line of cylinders, free long waves are found to exist and propagate faster than the set-down long wave bound to the short wave envelopes. At Bragg resonance, the short waves are reflected by the array but the induced free long wave can pass through it. For a train of periodically modulated waves scattered by a finite strip of cylinders, the free long waves can propagate away from the <b>strip</b> or be <b>trapped</b> near the <b>strip</b> depending on the angle of incidence. by Yile Li.

40|$|In 1958, Preucil {{suggested}} an equation to calculate ink trap based on measurements of a printed sheet with a densitometer. Preucil 2 ̆ 7 s equation {{was based on}} the additivity rule and the proportional rule. However, these rules do not hold in all cases. Several alternative equations have been suggested. This study intends to examine the effectiveness of three ink trap equations using densitometry by means of comparing the calculated values to those measured by the gravimetric method. An attempt is also made to estimate the value of maximum printable density, Dm, in Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s equation. The theoretical basis of each equation is briefly introduced. The causes attributing to the failure of additivity and proportionality are discussed as well. Also reviewed are several methods for measuring ink trap, such as colorimetric, spectrophotometric, and magnetic methods, and factors involved in the efficiency of ink trapping. In the experiment, two newsprint and one coated paper were printed with cyan, magenta, and yellow ink in a simulated wet-on-wet condition on the IGT printability tester. Each ink had a specific tack. The second-down inks were transferred on the first ink layers with low, medium, and high thickness. The percent ink <b>trapping</b> on printed <b>strips</b> were then calculated by both the densitometric methods and the gravimetric method. The factors causing poor trapping and back-trap in the experiment are discussed. Preucil 2 ̆ 7 s equation was found to correspond better with gravimetric trap values than Brunner 2 ̆ 7 s equation. However, both under estimated ink trap in the majority of the tested conditions. As the ink trap measured gravimetrically increased, the discrepancy of ink trap calculated by Preucil 2 ̆ 7 s equation increased. This applied to Brunner 2 ̆ 7 s equation as well, but not obviously to Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s equation. Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s equation proved to reduce the differences between gravimetric ink trap and densitometric ink trap significantly. A Dm value of 1. 59 for newsprint A, 1. 99 for newsprint B, and 2. 5 for coated paper resulted in the greatest accuracy over the conditions tested. When the Dm value approaches infinity, Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s equation becomes the equivalent of Preucil 2 ̆ 7 s equation. The experiment suggests that a range of Dm values between 1. 5 and 2. 5 was suitable for the tested conditions. For future research, a larger selection of various types of papers and inks are needed to specify a Dm value for general conditions. It might also be useful to specify a theoretical maximum printable density for general conditions, with which the maximum printable density of a given paper can be compared. Thus, the reproduction quality of the paper can be predicted before the printing is conducted. Since the effects of back-trap and ink contamination influence the accuracy of Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 s equation in this experiment, studies for compensating this inaccuracy are suggested...|$|R
