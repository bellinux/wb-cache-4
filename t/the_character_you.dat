500|$|The [...] "James Bond Theme" [...] {{was written}} by Monty Norman and was first orchestrated by the John Barry Orchestra for 1962's Dr. No, {{although}} the actual authorship of the music has {{been a matter of}} controversy for many years. In 2001, Norman won £30,000 in libel damages from The Sunday Times newspaper, which suggested that Barry was entirely responsible for the composition. The theme, as written by Norman and arranged by Barry, was described by another Bond film composer, David Arnold, as [...] "bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, definitely an instrument of rock 'n' roll... it represented everything about <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>you</b> would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable. And he did it in two minutes." [...] Barry composed the scores for eleven Bond films and had an uncredited contribution to Dr. No with his arrangement of the Bond Theme.|$|E
500|$|Filming {{took place}} on {{location}} in Jamaica between 16 January and 21 February 1962; five days later filming began at Pinewood Studios in England with sets designed by Ken Adam, who had previously worked with Broccoli on the 1960 film The Trials of Oscar Wilde. Maurice Binder created the title sequence and introduced the gun barrel motif that appears in all the Eon Bond films. Monty Norman wrote the accompanying soundtrack, which included the [...] "James Bond Theme", heard in the gun barrel sequence and in a calypso medley over the title credits; the theme was described by another Bond film composer, David Arnold, as [...] "bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, definitely an instrument of rock 'n' roll... it represented everything about <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>you</b> would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable. And {{he did it in}} two minutes". The theme was arranged by John Barry, who was uncredited for the arrangement but credited for his performance.|$|E
500|$|Monty Norman {{was invited}} to write the soundtrack because Broccoli liked {{his work on the}} 1961 theatre {{production}} Belle, a musical about murderer Hawley Harvey Crippen. Norman was busy with musicals, and only accepted to do the music for Dr. No after Saltzman allowed him to travel along with the crew to Jamaica. The most famous composition in the soundtrack is the [...] "James Bond Theme", which is heard in the gunbarrel sequence and in a calypso medley over the title credits, and was written by Norman based on a previous composition of his. John Barry, who would later go on to compose the music for eleven Bond films, arranged the Bond theme, but was uncredited—except for the credit of his orchestra playing the final piece. It has occasionally been suggested that Barry, not Norman, composed the [...] "James Bond Theme". This argument {{has been the subject of}} two court cases, the most recent in 2001, which found in favour of Norman. The theme, as written by Norman and arranged by Barry, was described by another Bond film composer, David Arnold, as [...] "bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, definitely an instrument of rock 'n' roll... it represented everything about <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>you</b> would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable.

2500|$|The {{collaboration}} with Romani on Il pirata began in May 1827 and, by August, {{the music was}} being written. By then, the composer was {{aware that he was}} to write music for his favourite tenor Giovanni Battista Rubini and the soprano was to be Henriette Méric-Lalande. Both singers had starred in Bianca in the original 1826 production. The strong cast also included Antonio Tamburini, a major bass-baritone of the time. But rehearsals did not progress without some difficulties, as both Weinstock and Galatopoulos recount: it appears that Bellini found Rubini, while singing beautifully, to be lacking [...] expressiveness: he was urged to [...] "throw yourself with all your sole into <b>the</b> <b>character</b> <b>you</b> are representing" [...] and to use [...] body, [...] "to accompany your singing with gestures", as well as to act with [...] voice. It appears that Bellini's exhortations bore fruit, based on his own account of the audience's reactions to the first performance, as well as the reaction of the Gazzetta privilegiata di Milano of 2 December which noted that this opera [...] "introduced us to Rubini's dual personality as a singer and actor". The reviewer continued to declare that this duality had never been expressed in other operas in which he had performed.|$|E
