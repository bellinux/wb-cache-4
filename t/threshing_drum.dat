5000|$|The Weald and Downland Museum in Singleton, West Sussex, England has a Marshall <b>Threshing</b> <b>Drum</b> [...] {{which dates}} from 1862.|$|E
50|$|The <b>threshing</b> <b>drum</b> with a {{width of}} 1250 mm and a {{diameter}} of 450 mm has six rasp bars, its rotational speed is infinitely adjustable between 650 min&minus;1 and 1400 min&minus;1. The distance between the <b>threshing</b> <b>drum</b> and concave is finely adjustable. Four straw walkers with an overall width of 1250 mm and a total length of 2400 mm separate the remaining grain from the straw. The grain is cleaned twice with sieves measuring 920 mm × 1070 mm. An elevator transports the cleaned grain to a sorting cylinder on the roof. It sorts three quality grades of grain. For some fruit types, special sorting sieves were offered.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{steam engines}} were too large and {{expensive}} {{for use on}} the average farm; however, the first positive evidence of steam power being used to drive a threshing machine was in 1799 in north Yorkshire. The next recorded application was in 1812, when Richard Trevithick designed the first 'semi-portable' stationary steam engine for agricultural use, known as a [...] "barn engine". This was a high-pressure, rotative engine with a Cornish boiler, for Sir Christopher Hawkins of Probus, Cornwall. It was used to drive a corn threshing machine and was much cheaper to run than the horses it replaced. Indeed, it was so successful that it remained in use for nearly 70 years, and has been preserved by the Science Museum in London. Although termed 'semi-portable', {{as they could be}} transported and installed without being dismantled, these engines were essentially stationary. They were used to drive such barn machinery as pumps and hammer mills, bone-crushers, chaff and turnip cutters, and fixed and mobile <b>threshing</b> <b>drums.</b>|$|R
40|$|Mechanical wheat {{threshing}} {{has gained}} a spectacular popularity in Pakistan over a short span of time {{and so is the}} population of beater wheat threshers that are being manufactured and marketed by the roadside vendors with little scientific and engineering experience. In fact, the major problems on conventional threshers have been identified as bulky weight, poor machine performance, human accidents and a high fuel consumption rate. Therefore, there was a dire need of research in Pakistan for modification and improvements in the prevalent design of the conventional wheat thresher to bring about durability, reduction in weight of machine and grain losses in addition to an accident free and cost effective thresher. A review of the indigenous thresher suggests presence of three heavy flywheels with little scientific argument and similarly poorly designed beaters/spikes and five rings on the beater-drum appear injudicious and unscientific. A horizontal throw of straw from the exhaust-blower takes away a noticeable amount of grains with it. Indigenous threshers have witnessed terrifying accidents for the persons feeding the material. The local manufacturers least care about the fabrication drawings of the conventional machines and therefore their knowledge of manufacturing is restricted to the whims and wishes of â&# 8364;&# 339;ustad-shagirdâ&# 8364;� (seniors, juniors). In view of above mentioned problems, the present study hypothesizes engineering oriented solutions for the ill-designs of the conventional threshers. Modified designs and fabrication drawings of various components such as flywheel, beater, beater drum, blower and feeding conveyer were prepared. Both machines were operated during the wheat threshing seasons for two consecutive years at farmerâ&# 8364;&# 8482;s field. During threshing seasons 2011 - 2012 farmers were interviewed about this new design. Their comments were commamorable. Major hindrance in purchasing conventional thresher is high cost. Total weight of redesigned wheat thresher was reduced from 1600 kg to 1300 kg by improving beaters in <b>thresher</b> <b>drum</b> and the grain damage in redesigned thresher reduced four times, thereby saving buying cost about Rs. 50, 000 The mean threshing efficiency is increased from 98...|$|R
5000|$|The cut crop {{is carried}} up the feeder throat (commonly called the [...] "feederhouse") by a chain and flight elevator, then {{fed into the}} {{threshing}} mechanism of the combine, consisting of a rotating <b>threshing</b> <b>drum</b> (commonly called the [...] "cylinder"), to which grooved steel bars (rasp bars) are bolted. The rasp bars thresh or separate the grains and chaff from the straw through {{the action of the}} cylinder against the concave, a shaped [...] "half drum", also fitted with steel bars and a meshed grill, through which grain, chaff and smaller debris may fall, whereas the straw, being too long, is carried through onto the straw walkers. This action is also allowed because grain is heavier than straw, which causes it to fall rather than [...] "float" [...] across from the cylinder/concave to the walkers. The drum speed is variably adjustable on most machines, whilst the distance between the drum and concave is finely adjustable fore, aft and together, to achieve optimum separation and output. Manually engaged disawning plates are usually fitted to the concave. These provide extra friction to remove the awns from barley crops. After the primary separation at the cylinder, the clean grain falls through the concave and to the shoe, which contains the chaffer and sieves. The shoe is common to both conventional combines and rotary combines.|$|E

Oil palm cultivation cut across all the nine states of Niger Delta (Akwa Ibom, Abia, Rivers, Edo, Imo, Ondo, Bayelsa, Cross River and Delta) (PIND 2011). Palm oil mills produce a large amount of solid wastes. The remainder of the oil palm consists of huge amount of lignocellulosic materials such as oil palm fronds, trunks, palm kernel and empty fruit bunches. The residues contain 7.0 million tonnes of oil palm trunks, 26.2 million tonnes of oil palm fronds and 23 % of empty fruit bunch (EFB) per tonne of fresh fruit bunch (FFB) processed in oil palm mill. These residues may cause environmental pollution problems and spread diseases (Udoetok 2012).|$|R

Forward speed is a main variable to control the feeding rate of combine harvester for high efficiency. In this study a control strategy based on optimum threshing power consumption model was developed and integrated into a speed control system for combine harvester automation. A conventional self-propelled combine harvester (Xinjiang-II) was equipped with multiple sensors to collect online information, including forward speed, <b>threshing</b> <b>drum</b> torque and speed. Forward speed was then adjusted by an electric-hydraulic unit based on designed PID controller to achieve an optimum range of threshing power consumption.

40|$|Abstract [...] -This work {{presents}} a {{comprehensive mathematical model}} {{of the performance of}} a cereal thresher. The essence of this work is to improve on the performance of grain thresher through a model that will optimize the performance characteristics (velocity, crop feed rate, concave clearance, <b>threshing</b> <b>drum</b> impact force, crop flow rate) of a thresher and minimize its grain damage or losses. To achieve this, equations were derived which describe the threshing rate, threshing loss, grain damage, efficiency and threshing capacity. The equations were used to simulate and optimize the threshing performance of the model. The model was validated with published threshing performance data and it was found generally to fit well, taking R 2 values equal to or greater than 0. 9 which is highly significant (α= 0. 000). The developed model enables optimal parameters to be selected for a design in which the objective function (grain damage or losses) is minimized. At 16 % moisture level, minimal loss is 3. 6792 % and efficiency of 92. 32 % while the performance characteristics are v = 9 m/s, Q = 0. 12 kg/s, c = 0. 015 m...|$|E
40|$|This seminar {{begins by}} {{outlining}} {{the history of}} wheat cutting and threshing, briefly tracing these operations from early primitive methods to to-day 2 ̆ 7 s modern combine-harvester. An equally brief description is then given of the principal components of a combine-harvester. Following this, several trials conducted to evaluate the perfarmance of combine-harvesters are discussed in relative detail.

An analysis of the characteristics of some experimental machines is then made, followed by a discussion of the design features that would be preferable when considering the building of an experimental combine-harvester. A summary of the more unusual threshing methods is then presented together with several experimental methods at present in the stage of research. A conclusion was drawn from these, that possibly the best value of further investigations would be gained in perfecting the method most commonly used at present, that is, of the rasp-bar cylinder and concave method of threshing, since, taken all round, there {{does not appear to be}} any superior method at present in use, or is there likely to be in the immediate future...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} stating fuzzy expert information for intelligent systems of decision support. The application of such systems is worthwhile when complex agricultural machines operate under the changing field conditions, characterized by fuzziness of information concerning external environment and parameters of a machine. One of the important stages of making expert systems for agricultural machines is modelling of fuzzy information regarding input and output parameters {{of the system and}} also their interrelations. The paper presents the problem solution of linguistic representation of the adjustable parameters of a combine harvester: speed of the combine movement, rotational speed of the <b>threshing</b> <b>drum,</b> and rotational speed of the separator fan. These parameters are most important for providing qualitative indices of technological process in combine harvesting, and they are characterized by efficiency of control and accessibility of updating. As a result of the analysis, linguistic variable, basic and extended term-sets have been determined. On the basis of the information, obtained from four experts, membership functions have been constructed with the use of standard functions of triangle and trapezoidal types. The indices of consistency of the expert models have been calculated, and the optimal models have been {{selected on the basis of}} their analysis...|$|E
40|$|A {{thresher}} {{was developed}} for threshing, separating, and cleaning millet seeds. The major components of the machine include threshing, separation and cleaning units. The threshing operation is achieved by rotational motion of a cylinder fitted with beater pegs above a stationary grid which results in {{the removal of the}} seeds from the panicles and their separation from the bulk of the straw. After being beating out, the grains fall through a concave grid into the cleaning unit which consists of two sieves that undergo reciprocating motion. Whilst the grains are moving over these sieves, a constant blast of air is being sent through them which blow out materials that are lighter than the grain. The machine was designed to be powered by a 5 hp electric motor. It was tested to thresh, separate and clean the millet seeds. The results showed that the machine had the highest threshing and cleaning efficiencies of 63. 2 and 62. 7 %, respectively, when pearl millet panicles were processed at 13 % moisture content and at an 800 rpm threshing cylinder speed. The lowest threshing and cleaning efficiencies of 40. 68 and 50 %, respectively, were obtained when the pearl millet panicle was processed at 17 % moisture content and a 600 rpm threshing cylinder speed, and at 17 % moisture content and 700 rpm. Thus, the optimum operating parameters of the machine were 13 % moisture content (wet basis) of pearl millet panicles and 800 rpm <b>threshing</b> <b>drum</b> speed. The successful development of this machine is expected to reduce drudgery associated with the traditional method of threshing millet and therefore increase productivity of farmers...|$|E
40|$|Performance of a Yanmar DB 1000 {{mechanised}} paddy thresher was comparatively assessed against manual threshing by {{impact method}} using a locally-made wooden box for Amankwatia and AGRA rice varieties under farmer’s field conditions at Nobewam in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. The mechanised thresher was evaluated at various <b>threshing</b> <b>drum</b> speeds (550 rpm, 600 rpm and 650 rpm) and feeding rates (200 kgh– 1, 400 kgh– 1 and 600 kgh– 1). Results showed that threshing was satisfactory at grain moisture content between 16. 9 % w. b. and 18. 0 % w. b. for both rice varieties. Threshing efficiency increased from 94. 6 % to 95. 8 % with {{no significant difference}} observed whereas cleaning efficiency decreased significantly from 84. 2 % to 81. 6 % with increasing feed rate irrespective of rice variety. Again, threshing efficiency increased with increasing drum rotational speed, irrespective of feed rate and rice variety. Percentage broken grain and grain loss both increased with increasing peripheral drum speed and paddy feed rate irrespective of rice variety. Average fuel consumption, physical energy requirement and threshing capacity increased significantly with increasing drum speed and feed rate. Crop moisture content and shattering ability influenced the threshing efficiency, threshing capacity, grain loss, broken grain, fuel and physical energy requirement at threshing. AGRA rice variety generally performed better than Amankwatia under both mechanical and manually threshing methods. Mechanised threshing was significantly better at reducing grain loss and physical energy demand whilst yielding over 200 % higher threshing capacity than manual threshing by impact using the wooden box. Mechanised threshing was financially rewarding, yielding over 500 % higher profit margin than the manual threshing option.
