500|$|In late 1949, President Truman asked Dean Acheson to {{concentrate}} {{on the question of whether}} the United States should develop the hydrogen bomb. Acheson formed a working group under the United States National Security Council (NSC) executive secretary Sidney Souers, consisting of R. Gordon Arneson, Paul Nitze and Fisher, who served as the State Department's legal adviser on the project. It was Arneson's view that each member of the working group were of one mind. He said, [...] "The four principals in the State Department were Acheson, Nitze, Fisher and myself. I don't think it was necessary for any one of us to persuade anybody else; we all were of a mind <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> wasn't any choice." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Tobacco" [...] segment {{received}} widespread media coverage, {{with several}} outlets praising Oliver's ability to launch successful marketing campaigns and [...] "alter perceptions about smoking" [...] {{through the creation}} of the mascot Jeff. Her Campuss Kelly Tierney noted the enthusiasm displayed by Oliver's fans during the segment and wrote: While John Oliver simply considers himself a comedian, it is apparent that he is doing much more than comedy. [...] He informs us of real issues we otherwise wouldn't hear or think deeply about, which in and of itself is brilliant, but what really sets him apart is his way of calling his audience to action about these issues. He shows us <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> is something we can do and helps us to see how we can enact change.|$|E
500|$|Studios Hergé serialised Tintin in Tibet weekly from September 1958 to November 1959, {{two pages}} per week, in Tintin magazine. Because {{of his desire}} for accuracy, Hergé added the logo of Air India to the {{airliner}} crash debris. A representative of Air India complained to Hergé about the adverse publicity the airline might suffer, arguing, [...] "It's scandalous, none of our aircraft has ever crashed; you have done us a considerable wrong." [...] Air India had cooperated with Hergé, aiding his research by providing him reading material, contemporary photographs, and film footage of India and Nepal, particularly Delhi and Kathmandu. While the crashed aircraft's tail number remained [...] "VT", the country code for Indian aircraft, Hergé agreed to change the airline logo in the published edition to the fictional Sari-Airways, dryly noting that {{there were so many}} Indian airlines it was possible <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> was a Sari-Airways.|$|E

500|$|Astronaut Buzz Aldrin {{called the}} visual effects [...] "remarkable", and said, [...] "I was so extravagantly {{impressed}} by the portrayal {{of the reality of}} zero gravity. Going through the space station was done just the way that I've seen people do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen—maybe not quite that vigorous—but certainly we've been fortunate that people haven't been in those situations yet. I think it reminds us <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> are hazards in the space business, especially in activities outside the spacecraft." [...] Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman said, [...] "The pace and story was definitely engaging and I think it was the best use of the 3-D IMAX medium to date. Rather than using the medium as a gimmick, Gravity uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people. But the question that most people want me to answer is, how realistic was it? The very fact that the question is being asked so earnestly {{is a testament to the}} verisimilitude of the movie. When a bad science fiction movie comes out, no one bothers to ask me if it reminded me of the real thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|She later reconsidered her {{characterization}} {{that it was}} a consensual relationship. In {{an interview}} on HLN's The Joy Behar Show, she said: [...] "As I was writing the book, I thought, this word, it kept sitting wrong with me. But I used it {{for lack of a better}} word. Since then, I've been schooled by thousands of incest survivors all across the world <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> is no such thing as consensual incest due to the inherent power a parent has over a child. So, I wouldn't necessarily call it a consensual relationship at this time." ...|$|E

5000|$|The game {{garnered}} few but positive reviews. GameSpot's Chris Gregson concluded [...] "Some {{might think}} $9.95 per month {{is a little}} pricey for a single game - that's what Kesmai charges {{for all of its}} sundry online-only games on GameStorm, for example - but they need to remember <b>that</b> <b>there's</b> <b>really</b> no other game online like this one. And if it gets its hooks in you, you'll probably consider the price a bargain.", awarding Tanarus a score of 8/10.|$|R

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{remarkable}} side of Sheehan was his vision of a reorganised Irish society which he hoped would take shape in an Independent Ireland. His nationalism was neither exclusively Gaelic nor Catholic and best portrayed by him in his novel The Intellectuals (1911), whose archetypical characters of man and women of Catholic and Protestant background from Ireland, England and Scotland, meet to discuss current issues of the day, Sheehan in the preface saying [...] "that his object was to show <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> was no invincible antagonism amongst {{the people who make}} up the commonwealth of Ireland that may not be removed by a freer and kindlier intercourse with each other".|$|E
2500|$|Attorney {{and author}} Mark Lane {{said that he}} interviewed several jurors after the trial. Although these {{interviews}} have never been published, Lane said {{that some of the}} jurors believed that Garrison had in fact proven to them <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> was a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy, but that Garrison had not adequately linked the conspiracy to Shaw or provided a motive. Author and playwright James Kirkwood, who was a personal friend of Clay Shaw, said that he spoke to several jury members who denied ever speaking to Lane. Kirkwood also cast doubt on Lane's claim that the jury believed there was a conspiracy. In his book American Grotesque, Kirkwood said that jury foreman Sidney Hebert told him: [...] "I didn't think too much of the Warren Report either until the trial. Now I think a lot more of it than I did before...." ...|$|E
2500|$|When he {{rejected}} the film, Porat reportedly said, [...] "People will think <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> are murders taking place here. In fact, the film opens with the line, [...] "All of the events described in this film are fictional—except for one", leading the audience to wonder which one it is. That is not, however, the only reference to real events in Israeli television. The Hebrew name of the film, רצח, מצלמים (Retzach, metzalmim, literally, [...] "Murder, we're filming"), is a play on {{the name of a}} popular TV show, שקט, מצלמים (Sheket, metzalmim, or [...] "Quiet, we're filming"), and among the subplots are a news story about striking workers (a continuation of the story Loevy began in Bread) (other news stories being covered throughout the film include tensions between religious and secular, men and women, the unemployed and the wealthy, Arabs and Jews, and new immigrants—the detective investigating the murders is a Russian immigrant, who once served in the KGB and the FBI).|$|E

2500|$|In August 2009, Arudou—acting as {{the chair}} of FRANCA (the Foreign Residents and Naturalized Citizens Association)—began a letter-writing {{campaign}} to protest an advertisement by McDonald’s Japan featuring a bespectacled, mildly geeky, 43-year-old American Japanophile known as Mr. James—a burger mascot who proclaims his love for the fast-food outlet in broken katakana Japanese. Writing in The Japan Times, Arudou argued that the [...] "Mr. James" [...] campaign perpetuates negative stereotypes about non-Japanese Caucasian minorities living in Japan, and demanded that McDonald’s Japan withdraw the advertisement: [...] "Imagine McDonald's, a multinational that has long promoted cultural diversity, launching a McAsia Menu in America featuring a deep-bowing, grimacing Asian in a bathrobe and platform sandals saying 'Me likee McFlied Lice!' or 'So solly, prease skosh honorable teriyaki sandrich?'" [...] Time magazine's Coco Masters concluded: [...] "To protest Mr. James as a stereotype of a minority population in Japan because the Ohio native fails to speak or write Japanese fluently, dresses like a nerd and blogs about burgers only ends up underscoring the fact <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> aren't a lot of foreigners who fit the bill running around Japan." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{ubiquitous}} rubric [...] "criticism of Israel", however, {{has also}} come to designate another kind of discourse—one that has almost become a politico-rhetorical genre unto itself, with its own identifiable vocabulary, narrative conventions, and predictable outcomes. At its ideational core is what the British scholar Bernard Harrison calls a [...] "dialectical scam". It goes something like this: (1) Spot an Israeli action that can serve as the ground of [...] "criticism of Israel" [...] (e.g., Israel's military incursion into the area near Jenin in April 2002 in response to Palestinian terrorist massacres); (2) Then [...] "dissent" [...] in the strongest possible terms, for instance by likening the [...] "razing of Jenin" [...] {{to the destruction of}} the Warsaw Ghetto, while anticipating that [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "repressive" [...] Jewish institutions will try to [...] "silence" [...] the critics by calling them anti-Semites; (3) When taken to task by more sober-minded critics who find that, contrary to your charge, {{there was no such thing}} as [...] "the razing of Jenin" [...] and that the IDF has nothing in common with the SS, cry [...] "foul" [...] and claim their censure perfectly illustrates the point <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>really</b> is a Jewish organizational conspiracy to silence [...] "criticism of Israel" [...] by branding the authors of such criticism [...] "antisemites".|$|E
