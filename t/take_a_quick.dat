5|$|A counterattack to {{take back}} the {{airfield}} and Point 107 was organised for the following day at Hargest's headquarters. He was exhausted and had to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> nap before a conference to work out detailed plans for the counter-attack, much to the disgust of some of the other participants. Afterwards, he became pessimistic of the chances of success and unsuccessfully sought to have the attack called off. The attack did fail but Hargest, still well behind the frontlines, mistakenly believed it to be going well until he found that his brigade had returned to their starting positions. His pessimism began to affect Puttick, who asked Freyberg to allow the 5th Infantry Brigade to withdraw, which it duly did. This began an eventual retreat and evacuation from Crete on 31 May, with Hargest flying out for Egypt by seaplane, his brigade following by sea.|$|E
5|$|Between July 1 and July 12, 1916, {{five people}} were {{attacked}} {{along the coast}} of New Jersey by sharks; only one of the victims survived. The first major attack occurred on Saturday, July 1 at Beach Haven, a resort town established on Long Beach Island off the southern coast of New Jersey. Charles Epting Vansant, 25, of Philadelphia was on vacation at the Engleside Hotel with his family. Before dinner, Vansant decided to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> swim in the Atlantic with a Chesapeake Bay Retriever that was playing on the beach. Shortly after entering the water, Vansant began shouting. Bathers believed he was calling to the dog, but a shark was actually biting Vansant's legs. He was rescued by lifeguard Alexander Ott and bystander Sheridan Taylor, who claimed the shark followed him to shore as they pulled the bleeding Vansant from the water. Vansant's left thigh was stripped of its flesh; he bled to death on the manager's desk of the Engleside Hotel at 6:45p.m.|$|E
25|$|The Jets {{lined up}} in an I formation, with Sanchez under center. In the backfield were fullback Lex Hilliard and running back Shonn Greene, 4.5 and 7 yards behind the line of {{scrimmage}} respectively. Sanchez had called the play in the huddle: a designed handoff to the fullback. Typically in this formation, the running back receives the ball, and the fullback blocks for him. The play call would attempt to misdirect the defense, as Greene would peel away to the left and Hilliard would <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> handoff to the right.|$|E

25|$|On {{the fourth}} {{afternoon}} of the Fourth Test, the Indian batting collapsed, and Australia {{had an opportunity to}} bowl them out and chase a target of around 250–300 after the tea break. However, the Australians were a long way behind on their over rate, so in order to avoid a one match suspension, Ponting chose to bowl their part-time spinners and medium pacers such as Michael Clarke, Cameron White and Mike Hussey (who were all unsuccessful in capturing a wicket), as they took less time. In the meantime, captain MS Dhoni and Harbhajan both added half centuries. This drew strong criticism from many commentators, who suggested that their faster bowlers, who had been responsible for the collapse, could have bowled from a shorter run-up. When the fast bowlers were reintroduced, the last four wickets fell quickly. This left Australia with 382 runs for victory and Ponting fell cheaply after attempting to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> single down the ground and being run out by a direct hit from Mishra at the non-striker's end. Australia lost by 172 runs to cede the series 2–0. In the first innings, Ponting became Harbhajan's 300th Test wicket. He ended the series with 264 runs at 37.71. While below his career standards, it was substantially better than his previous Test efforts in India.|$|E
500|$|During the season, Scott {{played in}} 12 of 13games, {{including}} 11starts, and recorded 1,133rushing yards and eight touchdowns. In {{the first game}} of the 2008 season against Delaware, Scott ran for 197yards in his first career start, which was enough to place sixteenth on the list for school all-time single-game rushing. The following week, underdog Middle Tennessee stunned Maryland, 24–14, but Scott set the game-high for rushing with 123yards. He tallied his career-first rushing touchdown with a 63-yard run on the second play of the game. Scott [...] "dominated early" [...] against 23rd-ranked California with 19carries for 87yards and two touchdowns, but in the third quarter, he suffered a game-ending shoulder injury. His first-half effort helped Maryland <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> lead and eventually upset California, 35–27. Scott sat out the next game against Eastern Michigan, but returned for the road game at 20th-ranked Clemson. Scott made 23carries but gained only 39yards, a mark that was surpassed by receiver Heyward-Bey on one reverse that gained 76yards to spark a second-half comeback. Head coach Friedgen said:"I told Da'Rel he needed to run a little more north–south. Clemson has such good team speed. If you go east–west on them, you're not going to go very far. I thought he had a couple runs when he tried to bounce it outside. Normally, Da'Rel can do that. Not against this team... I told him this is a game where three yards is a good running play... I don't know if Da'Rel has been in a game like this, playing the whole game that way in a tough environment. He came out in the second half and said 'I'm going to go, coach.' He patted me on the butt. 'Just get me the ball.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The fall of {{the third}} wicket {{provided}} a talking point: Yuvraj Singh swept Ian Blackwell's [...] delivery behind the stumps only for wicket keeper Geraint Jones to make a diving stop and throw the ball at the wicket, dislodging the leg stump and bail. With Singh still in his crease he was given not out, but Indian captain Rahul Dravid decided to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> run in the confusion as the ball ricocheted away; Paul Collingwood acted quickly though, and grabbed the ball and ran it into the remaining two stumps and bail just as Dravid {{made it to the}} crease. The TV umpire was called for the decision and after much deliberation Dravid was given out.|$|E

2500|$|Game 1 of the NLDS ended an 11–6 Philadelphia victory. After Roy Halladay {{struggled}} in the first, allowing {{a three-run homer}} to Lance Berkman, he settled down, at one point retiring twenty-one Cardinal hitters in a row. After Game 1, Chris Carpenter, starting on three-day's rest {{for the first time}} in his career, allowed the Phillies to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> 4–0 lead in Game 2. And with Cliff Lee on the mound for the Phils, the game seemed out of reach. [...] "You can count on one finger the number of times you'll come back from four runs down against Cliff Lee", Lance Berkman said. That's exactly what the Cardinals did, and took a 5–4 lead after an RBI single by Albert Pujols. The series was tied at one game apiece. [...] "That win was huge for us", Tony La Russa said. [...] "Realistically, us winning three in a row was not really possible." [...] The famous Rally Squirrel (aka, 'Busch Squirrel'), made his first appearance in Game 3 on October 4, and then again appeared in Game 4 on October 5, running across Home Plate at Busch Stadium in front of Skip Schumaker who was batting. The pitch was called a ball, and Roy Oswalt protested that it should not have counted. Nothing he did changed the umpire's mind though. Schumaker later flew out to left. The team was ahead at the time, 3–2, and held on for the 5–3 victory. The Rally Squirrel was instantly adopted by the fans as the postseason mascot, and thousands of rally squirrel T-shirts were sold. His Twitter account started, and by October 6 it had over 11,000 followers; by October 20, it had over 27,500 [...]|$|E

60|$|Drawing {{the noose}} taut, he tested the {{solidity}} of its hold. Satisfied, the ape-man ran nimbly up the vertical wall, {{aided by the}} rope which he clutched in both hands.

60|$|Inside the block-house {{was great}} activity, but no confusion. That little band of fighters {{might have been}} drilled for a king's bodyguard.

He did not discharge his weapon aimlessly as the Indians did, but waited until he saw the outline of an Indian form, or a red coat, or a puff of white smoke; then he would thrust the rifle-barrel forward, <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> aim and fire. By the side of every man stood a heroic woman whose face was blanched, but who spoke never a word as she put the muzzle of the hot rifle into a bucket of water, cooled the barrel, wiped it dry and passed it back to the man beside her.|$|E

60|$|For {{half a mile}} he closely {{followed}} the Delaware's plainly marked trail. Then he stopped to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> survey of the forest before him. He abruptly left the trail, and, breaking into a run, went through the woods as fleetly and noiselessly as a deer, running {{for a quarter of}} a mile, when he stopped to listen. All seemed well, for he lowered his head, and walked slowly along, examining the moss and leaves. Presently he came upon a little open space where the soil was a sandy loam. He bent over, then rose quickly. He had come upon the Indian's trail. Cautiously he moved forward, stopping every moment to listen. In all the close pursuits of his maturer years he had never been a victim of that most cunning of Indian tricks, an ambush. He relied solely on his ear to learn if foes were close by. The wild creatures of the forest were his informants. As soon as he heard any change in their twittering, humming or playing--whichever way they manifested their joy or fear of life--he became as hard to see, as difficult to hear as a creeping snake.|$|E
