5|$|The PIP and Para {{versions}} of the M249 {{have been used in}} the Iraq war since the invasion. By 2004, many M249s had been in service for almost 20 years and were becoming increasingly unreliable. Soldiers were requesting replacements and new features, and there are reports of soldiers holding their weapons together with duct tape. The lethality of the 5.56mm ammunition has been called into question by reports of enemy soldiers still firing after being hit multiple times. As in previous conflicts, the sandy environment causes the M249s and other weapons <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> <b>up</b> and jam if they are not cleaned frequently.|$|E
500|$|The game {{opens with}} Diddy {{standing}} {{on the deck of}} a pirate ship. In the ship's cabin, he finds a note stating that Donkey Kong has been kidnapped by King K. Rool, who had demanded the entire Banana Hoard that he stole in the previous game for a ransom from the Kongs. Diddy and Dixie subsequently attempt to rescue Donkey Kong from K. Rool. Together, they travel through Crocodile Isle and are helped on their way by an assortment of animals to defeat K. Rool and rescue Donkey Kong. Diddy and Dixie eventually battle and defeat K. Rool, though he escapes after releasing Donkey Kong. Shortly after, Diddy and Dixie discover a secret area known as the [...] "Lost World". After going through the Lost World, they once again defeat K. Rool in [...] "Krocodile Kore", in a hidden geyser at the heart of Crocodile Island. Upon being defeated, K. Rool is hurled into the geyser, causing it <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> <b>up</b> and explode. The explosion causes all of Crocodile Island to sink, as the Kongs watch K. Rool escape on a small sailboat.|$|E
500|$|The Moroccan {{infantry}} {{took the}} lead, and the French commanders sealed {{themselves in their}} tank turrets and advanced behind. Viet Minh forces, which were waiting in ambush, fired almost the same instant as the lead Moroccan units who noticed their presence. The Moroccan forces spread out into the surrounding rice paddies, and the bazookas of the Viet Minh missed the French tanks. The French commander called in Piroth's artillery and Dong-Qué [...] "disintegrated under {{the impact of their}} high-angle fire", particularly when a French shell found the Viet Minh ammunition depot. As the French tanks approached, the Viet Minh drove the civilians out <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> <b>up</b> the entrance to the village, however as the Viet Minh retreated they were spotted through the civilians by the Moroccan infantry and killed by 13:00. During this battle, however, most of the Regiment 95 personnel who had been elsewhere managed to escape towards {{the southern end of the}} French encirclement. Leblanc had realized the intentions of Regiment 95's commander, and had requested one of the two reserve paratroop units to be deployed at the border between the network of temples and the dune-filled area in front of where Group D had originally landed. This paratroop unit, 2nd Battalion of the 1st Colonial Parachute Regiment, began to advance towards the canal at 10:45, 15 minutes before Group B entered Dong-Qué.|$|E
50|$|Previously, traffic used China National Highway 110, {{which used}} <b>to</b> be <b>clogged</b> <b>up</b> (at times) with traffic. With the traffic {{situation}} as it is, {{and with the}} onslaught of more traffic, work on the expressway started in 1998, culminating in {{the completion of the}} entire expressway on November 16, 2002. The entire length of the expressway is 148.2 kilometres.|$|R
50|$|A spoon straw {{features}} a cut-away shape {{at one end}} that functions as a miniature spoon. It is intended for slush drinks and milkshakes. Their original purpose was <b>to</b> avoid ice <b>clogging</b> <b>up</b> the submerged end of the straw.|$|R
50|$|Only {{certain types}} of ink {{can be used in}} a {{fountain}} pen, <b>to</b> avoid <b>clogging</b> <b>up</b> the nib unit mechanism. Although the larger reservoir of fountain pens requires less frequent ink replenishment, the ink may inconveniently spill out in certain contexts to stain the paper, fingers, or clothing of an unwary writer. Differences in air pressure may cause spectacular effects when travelling by airplane.|$|R
60|$|Since to you now, my gentlemen, the {{character}} of my mission known is, beseech I you so friendly to be and to me your valuable help grant. Mr. Potzl has the public believed make would that I to Vienna come am in order the bridges <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> <b>up</b> and the traffic to hinder, while I observations gather and note. Allow you yourselves but not from him deceived. My frequent presence on the bridges has an entirely innocent ground. Yonder gives it the necessary space, yonder can one a noble long German sentence elaborate, the bridge-railing along, and his whole contents with one glance overlook. On the {{one end of the}} railing pasted I the first member of a separable verb and the final member cleave I to the other end--then spread the body of the sentence between it out! Usually are for my purposes the bridges of the city long enough; when I but Potzl's writings study will I ride out and use the glorious endless imperial bridge. But this is a calumny; Potzl writes the prettiest German. Perhaps not so pliable as the mine, but in many details much better. Excuse you these flatteries. These are well deserved.|$|E
50|$|The {{air intake}} filter tends <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> <b>up</b> with sawdust. This must be cleaned from time to time, but {{is not a problem}} during normal operation.|$|E
50|$|This {{has been}} made worse with the {{introduction}} of the Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system on more modern cars. The oil vapors can mix with the re-circulated exhaust gasses and soot which then builds up on the intake manifold and valves etc. This layer over time hardens and thickens repeatedly. It will then begin <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> <b>up</b> the throttle body, swirl flaps, or even the intake valves on direct injected engines.|$|E
50|$|Standard axial case {{fans are}} 80, 92, 120, 140, 200 and 230 mm in width and length. As case fans {{are often the}} most readily visible form of cooling on a PC, {{decorative}} fans are widely available and may be lit with LEDs, made of UV-reactive plastic, and/or covered with decorative grilles. Decorative fans and accessories are popular with case modders. Air filters are often used over intake fans, to prevent dust from entering the case and <b>clogging</b> <b>up</b> the internal components. Heatsinks are especially vulnerable <b>to</b> being <b>clogged</b> <b>up,</b> as the insulating effect of the dust will rapidly degrade the heatsink's ability to dissipate heat.|$|R
50|$|As {{the fuel}} filter {{is the first}} point <b>to</b> become <b>clogged</b> <b>up,</b> most diesel motor cars are {{equipped}} with a filter heater. This allows summer diesel with a CFPP of -7 °C to be operated safely in -20 °C weather conditions. The fluid characteristics of winter diesel are also extended allowing a diesel type of CFPP -15 °C to be operated safely in -24 °C weather conditions. Note that a filter heater cannot melt wax particles in the feed system so that fuel supply can be problematic at cold start.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of its}} {{franchise}} agreement, Metro Trains Melbourne {{is required}} to modify the seating layout of all Comeng trains to have 2-2 seating which allows better passenger flow through the train and more standing room. So far most Comengs have had modifications to seating around the passenger doors <b>to</b> avoid people <b>clogging</b> <b>up</b> the doorways when a train is overcrowded.|$|R
5000|$|The anti-poll tax organisations {{encouraged}} non-payers not to register, <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> <b>up</b> {{the courts}} by contesting Local Council attempts to gain liability orders, {{and ultimately to}} fail to attend court hearings for non-compliance. In November 1990, South Yorkshire police said they were planning to refuse to arrest poll tax defaulters even when instructed to by the courts {{because it would be}} [...] "physically impossible for the police because of the large number of defaulters." ...|$|E
50|$|By mid-December 2004, {{a second}} exit lane was fitted for the Wangjing Science and Technology Park exit (clockwise direction). Previously, traffic used <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> <b>up</b> the entire ring road (at around 6 p.m. - 7 p.m. local time every workday) near that exit, {{as it is}} very close to Wangjing. Also, a second exit liaising {{directly}} with Wangjing is under construction; it {{is very close to}} the Wangjing filling station on the ring road (clockwise direction again).|$|E
50|$|Since many {{applications}} install their entries without asking the user, the macOS services menu tends <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> <b>up</b> {{with dozens of}} entries quickly. Most users only will ever use a small subset of the possible options, therefore cutting down and customizing the menu makes it both faster and more pleasant to use. Prior to Mac OS X Snow Leopard, third party software is required to do this; in Snow Leopard, the Services menu can be customized from the Keyboard pane of System Preferences.|$|E
25|$|The Sundarbans area {{is one of}} {{the most}} densely {{populated}} in the world, and the population is increasing. As a result, half of this ecoregion's mangrove forests have been cut down to supply fuelwood and other natural resources. Despite the intense and large-scale exploitation, this still {{is one of the}} largest contiguous areas of mangroves in the world. Another threat comes from deforestation and water diversion from the rivers inland, which causes far more silt to be brought <b>to</b> the estuary, <b>clogging</b> <b>up</b> the waterways.|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of a growth in both {{participatory}} democracy and responsible participation, rural decision-making in England has become increasingly complex over the past 30 years, fuelled by national polices relating to regionalism, citizenship and relocalisation. A survey of ‘agents of rural governance’ (ARGs) in the county of Gloucestershire, England, charts their recent growth, reasons for formation and perceived jurisdiction as well as examining complexities of decision-making relating to partnerships, networks and finance. The survey suggests that policies designed to ‘empower’ rural people can be seen <b>to</b> have <b>clogged</b> <b>up</b> rural decision-making processes sufficiently to have, effectively, disempowered many of them. The paper identifies and exemplifies six different types of ‘clogging up’ that impact upon rural decision-making: crowding, knotting, clouding, meandering, subverting and impoverishing. Whilst governmental proposals have been introduced in an attempt to rationalise this decision-making complexity, particularly through the Haskins Review and the English National Rural Strategy, other policy strands have conspired to make such decision-making essentially laissez faire...|$|R
50|$|As of September 2004, traffic {{has been}} <b>clogging</b> <b>up</b> {{more and more}} in the area. Due to the massive {{transportation}} of coal, what was a very smooth route in the summer is now <b>clogged</b> <b>up</b> with immense traffic jams.|$|R

5000|$|Bennett {{wanted to}} {{understand}} {{everything about the}} game of basketball to the point that, even as an NBA player, teammates felt he would rather learn and study the game than participate in it. Bennett's teams, especially at Virginia, {{are known for their}} motion offense and stifling defense which features his version of the [...] "pack line" [...] defensive strategy famously devised by his father. The pack line is designed <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> <b>up</b> potential driving lanes to the paint by forcing ball handlers {{to the middle of the}} floor where more [...] "help" [...] is concentrated. It forces opposing teams to pass and shoot well, while limiting dribble penetration and post play.|$|E

5|$|No {{ski poles}} are used, and no {{assistance}} from others (such as being pushed from the gate) is allowed. In heavy snow conditions the tracks can become <b>clogged</b> <b>up,</b> which reduces inrun speed and may cause an unpredictable descent for athletes.

5000|$|In December 2009, Eady commented in The Guardian {{on some of}} this criticism, {{saying that}} [...] "The media have nowhere to vent their frustrations other than through {{personal}} abuse of the particular judge who happens to have made the decision". He added {{that he does not}} see libel tourism as a problem: [...] "I believe the suggestion {{is that there is a}} large queue of people, loosely classified as 'foreigners', waiting <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> <b>up</b> our courts with libel actions that are without merit and which have nothing to do with our jurisdiction ... This is not a phenomenon we actually come across in our daily lives." ...|$|E
5000|$|It was {{virtually}} impossible to run these lumber rafts down Grandfather Falls. As a consequence, Jenny (Merrill) became the northern-most sawmill town. The Falls acted as a hazard to log drives as well. Prior to railroads penetrating the pineries in the 1880s, logs for the mills were cut and [...] "banked" [...] along the river and its tributaries, and {{in the spring of}} the year the logs were [...] "driven" [...] downstream to the mills. This work was always dangerous and difficult, but nothing was more dangerous than a log jam. [...] Once a set of logs started <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> <b>up</b> a river, the rest would back up behind. The largest log jam in Wisconsin history was at Grandfather Falls [...] - [...] 80,000,000 board feet backed up for miles.|$|E
5000|$|The A.V. Club writers Todd VanDerWerff and Zack Handlen {{gave the}} episode an A- rating, and said [...] "The sheer amount of balance that Fargo {{projects}} {{makes it all}} the more exciting when things rush forward helter-skelter (as when Molly shows Gus the photo of Malvo) or when unpredictable elements enter <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> <b>up</b> the story. In the latter category, we have those two hitmen from Fargo, while in the former, we have whatever Malvo is doing to hem in Stavros (which involves switching out his medication for Adderall and putting pig’s blood in his water supply for reasons I have yet to fathom). Yet Noah Hawley is careful to always balance out advances on both sides, so the whole thing feels like a complicated chess game either side could win—even if Molly and Malvo don’t precisely know they’re playing each other yet." ...|$|E
50|$|Warning: Horrendous {{traffic jams}} can <b>clog</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{the extent that}} the stretch from Madian to Jianxiang can become a three-lane car park during rush hour.

5000|$|If a {{team does}} not have the hammer in an end, it will opt to try <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> <b>up</b> the four-foot zone in the house to deny the {{opposing}} team access to the button. This can be done by throwing [...] "centre line" [...] guards {{in front of the house}} on the centre line, which can be tapped into the house later or drawn around. If a team has the hammer, they will try to keep this four-foot zone free so that they have access to the button area at all times. A team with the hammer may throw a corner guard as their first stone of an end placed in front of the house but outside the four-foot zone to utilize the free guard zone. Corner guards are key for a team to score two points in an end, because they can either draw around it later or hit and roll behind it, making the opposing team's shot to remove it more difficult.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine was}} {{extremely}} simple, made largely of sheet metal. Construction started {{late in the}} summer of 1936 and was completed in March 1937. Two weeks later the engine was running on hydrogen, but the high temperature exhaust led to considerable [...] "burning" [...] of the metal. The tests were otherwise successful, and in September the combustors were replaced and the engine was run on gasoline for the first time. Ohain had at last, albeit five months after Frank Whittle, working in parallel in England, run a self-contained turbojet. Running on gasoline proved <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> <b>up</b> the combustors, so Hahn designed a new version based on his soldering torch, which proved to work much better. Although the engine was never intended to be a flight-quality design, it proved beyond a doubt that the basic concept was workable, and Ohain had at last caught up with Whittle. With vastly more funding and industry support, Ohain would soon overtake Whittle and forge ahead.|$|E
5000|$|Ogbunigwe`s {{were used}} to {{spectacular}} and devastating effect in the Abagana ambush which wiped out almost the entire Nigerian 2nd Division in 1968. They were also used effectively in knocking out Nigerian Army Saladin and Ferret armoured cars. The Surface-to-air models were used against mercenary flown Nigerian Air Force Mig 17 jet fighters {{in the defense of}} Uli airport. The lack of a guidance system made the missiles notoriously inaccurate against fast flying jet aircraft. The design was based on an air burst principle intended to destabilize the plane by shock wave effect, as well as throw shrapnel and debris in its path <b>to</b> <b>clog</b> <b>up</b> the engines. Though some close calls are reported by Russian pilots flying for the Nigerian Air Force, there are no indications that a Biafran missile actually shot down an enemy plane. [...] The Biafran Air Force B-25 and B-26 bombers were also fitted with self made Ogbunigwe rockets and bombs.|$|E
