Clinicians often allow patients to choose which <b>thermal</b> <b>agent</b> they prefer. The purpose of this study was to help clinicians select the correct <b>thermal</b> <b>agent</b> as part of the overall treatment of patients with RA by determining if there was a significant difference between heat and cold application on the hand function of persons with RA. Fourteen subjects were randomly assigned to receive either heat or cold treatment and to administer that particular modality to either the right or left hand. The opposite hand served as a control and therefore was measured but not treated. Subjects were instructed to treat the proper hand once a day, five times in the next week. Measurements of the subjects 2 ̆ 7 grip strength, timing of coin count and pegboard functional tests, and ratings of pain and joint stiffness were measured before and after the treatment period. There was a significant difference (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) between the pre and posttest joint stiffness scores indicating that subjects perceived a decrease in joint stiffness when using heat and an increase in joint stiffness when using cold. however, there was not a significant difference (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) between the pre and posttest scores on grip strength, coin count, pegboard, and joint pain for the heat and cold groups.

40|$|Detailed {{chemical}} kinetic {{modeling of}} methane planar opposed-jet laminar diffusion flames burning in air {{mixed with a}} variety of thermal agents is used to characterize their effects on maximum flame temperature and extinction behavior. The identification of a well-defined limit temperature allows extinguishing concentrations for buoyancy-dominated methane flames to be predicted. Predicted extinguishing volume fractions are shown to be in good agreement with experimental results for opposed flow methane flames. It is further demonstrated that the calculations provide reliable estimates of relative <b>thermal</b> <b>agent</b> extinguishing effectiveness for both methane coflow flames and liquid-fueled heptane flames burning in a surrounding coflow, even though the required volume fractions of a given agent can differ substantially from those predicted for the opposed flow methane flames.

DH {{was applied to the}} thigh in 50 % of the participants before exercise. MRE, T 2 -weighted MRI, maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), creatine kinase (CK) concentration, and muscle soreness were measured before and after the protocol to assess EIMD effects. Five participants were excluded: four having not experienced EIMD and one due to incidental findings.   Results: Total workload performed during the EIMD protocol was greater in the DH group than the control group (P < 0. 03), despite no significant differences in baseline MVC (P= 0. 23). Shear stiffness |G*| increased in the rectus femoris (RF) muscle in both groups (P < 0. 03); however, DH was not a significant between-group factor (P= 0. 15). MVC values returned to baseline faster in the DH group (5 days) than the control group (7 days). Participants who displayed hyperintensity on T 2 -weighted images had a greater stiffness increase following damage than those without: RF; 0. 61 kPa vs. 0. 15 kPa, P < 0. 006, vastus intermedius; 0. 34 kPa vs. 0. 03 kPa, P = 0. 06.   Conclusion: EIMD produces increased muscle stiffness as measured by MRE, with the change in |G*| significantly increased when T 2 hyperintensity was present.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus in long term leads to vascular insufficiency.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effect(s) of contrast bath on circulation of contralateral lower limb in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus compared to healthy subjects. Methods: Fifteen diabetic females aged between 30 - 60 years, who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and 30 matched control females participated in this research. The oral temperature, skin temperature of the first web space of the foot, and the pulse of dorsalis pedis artery were measured and recorded. These results were evaluated prior to, immediately and 10 minutes after the contrast bath. The contrast bath protocol included the immersion of the right foot in the warm bath (38 - 44 °C) for four minutes and then in the cold bath (10 - 18 °C) for one minute. These processes were repeated five times as the total duration of the intervention was 24 minutes. The treatment was started and terminated with warm water. Repeated measures and independent t-test were used for data analysis. Results: The dorsalis pedis pulse was significantly higher at all times of the measurements except between immediately post the contrast bath and after 10 minutes of applying it in the diabetic group (P= 0. 58). The results of the skin temperature measurement demonstrated incremental changes in the healthy and the diabetic groups.

40|$|Thermal {{transport}} in aqueous suspensions of Au-core polymer-shell nanoparticles is {{investigated by}} time-resolved measurements of optical absorption. The addition of an organic cosolvent to the suspension causes the polystyrene {{component of the}} polymer shell to swell, and this change in the microstructure of the shell increases the effective thermal conductivity of the shell {{by a factor of}} approximately 2. The corresponding time scale for the cooling of the nanoparticle decreases from 200 ps to approximately 100 ps. The threshold concentration of cosolvent that creates the changes in thermal conductivity, 5 vol % tetrahydrofuran in water or 40 vol % N,N-dimethylformamide in water, is identical to the threshold concentrations for producing small shifts in the frequency of the plasmon resonance. Because the maximum fraction of solvent in the polymer shell is less than 20 vol %, the increase in the effective thermal conductivity of the shell cannot be easily explained by contributions to heat transport by the solvent or enhanced alignment of the polystyrene backbone along the radial direction.

The main aim of the present study was to compare the short-term effect of the ultrasound (US) and infrared (IR) on patients with plantar flexor muscle spasticity. Materials and Methods: 21 patients were randomly allocated placed to either US(n= 11) or IR(n= 10) groups. The main outcome measures were, H max / M max  ratio, Original Ashworth Scale(OAS), active and passive range of motion (ROM). These tests  performed before, immediately after and 15 minutes after the intervention. Results: There were no significant changes in H max / M max ratio and OAS after the intervention in both groups. The significant changes of the H max / M max were observed 15 minutes after intervention in the US group. The change in OAS was also statistical significant in IR group in this period. The changes in active and passive ankle dorsiflexion ROM after the intervention were statistically significant in US group. These changes show the significant changes for ankle passive ROM after 15 minutes of  the intervention in IR group.

40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} {{investigations into the}} thermal excitation of liquid paramagnetic contrast agents using the spin resonance relaxation mechanism are presented. The electronic spin-lattice relaxation time τ 1 e of gadolinium-based contrast agents, which is estimated at 0. 1 ns, is ten orders of magnitude faster than the relaxation time of protons in water. The shorter relaxation time is found to significantly increase the rate of thermal energy deposition. To the authors' knowledge {{this is the first}} study of gadolinium based contrast agents in a liquid state used as <b>thermal</b> <b>agents.</b> Analysis shows that when τ 1 e and other experimental parameters are optimally selected, a maximum theoretical heating rate of 29. 4 °C. s- 1 could be achieved which would suffice for clinical thermal ablation of neoplasms.

The results are compared to the simulated estimates via analysis of a detailed model of the system. While these experimentally determined temperature rises are small and thus of no clinical utility, their presence supports the theoretical analysis and strongly suggests that the chemical structure of the selected compounds {{plays an important role in}} this mechanism of heat deposition.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} effect of <b>thermal</b> <b>agents</b> on the range of {{movement}} (ROM) and mechanical properties in soft tissue and to discuss their clinical relevance. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE) were searched from their earliest available record up to May 2011 using Medical Subjects Headings and key words. We also undertook related articles searches and read reference lists of all incoming articles. STUDY SELECTION: Studies involving human participants describing the effects of thermal interventions on ROM and/or mechanical properties in soft tissue. Two reviewers independently screened studies against eligibility criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted independently by 2 review authors using a customized form. Methodologic quality was also assessed by 2 authors independently, using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty-six studies, comprising a total of 1301 healthy participants, satisfied the inclusion criteria. There was a high risk of bias across all studies. Meta-analyses were not undertaken because of clinical heterogeneity; however, effect sizes were calculated. There were conflicting data on {{the effect of}} cold on joint ROM, accessory joint movement, and passive stiffness. There was limited evidence to determine whether acute cold applications enhance the effects of stretching, and further evidence is required. There was evidence that heat increases ROM, and a combination of heat and stretching is more effective than stretching alone. CONCLUSIONS: Heat is an effective adjunct to developmental and therapeutic stretching techniques and should be the treatment of choice for enhancing ROM in a clinical or sporting setting.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the field emission and the thermal breakdown of 9 -cell TESLA SRF cavities, 150 specially developed surface scanning thermometers have been built. The description of the thermometers and their calibration in superfluid helium are presented. A special test chamber equipped with a heated niobium plate is used to study the thermometer thermal response versus the heater power at different bath temperature. The comparison of thermometer response with numerical simulations results and experimental data obtained with reference thermometers mounted on the Nb plate using a <b>thermal</b> bonding <b>agent,</b> allows to get an estimation of the measurement efficiency of scanning thermometers. Experimental data obtained with cavities are analysed {{with the help of}} the calibration results and numerical simulations. INTRODUCTION The development of He II surface thermometers for diagnosing and studying the thermal effects in supercoducting RF cavities has been a major activity of the Orsay [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{deals with}} the {{preparation}} and characterizacion of an improved fire-resistant ethylene-acrylate foamed material containing calcium carbonate and a silicon elastomer. This grade, usually employed on the cable industry sector, was modified two differents synergistic FR systems : silica/zinc borate (S/ZB) and montmorillonite/graphite nanoplatelets(N). The different formulations were prepared by melt-blending and the foams by a compression-molding foaming process using Azodicarbonamide as chemical blowing <b>agent.</b> <b>Thermal</b> stability and fire behaviour, of both solid and foamed materials were characterized by means of thermogravimetric and cone calorimetric techniques, respectively.

40|$|Titanium-water thermosyphons {{are being}} {{considered}} {{for use in the}} heat rejection system for lunar outpost fission surface power. Key to their use is heat transfer between a closed loop heat source and the heat pipe evaporators. This work describes laboratory testing of several interfaces that were evaluated for their thermal performance characteristics, in the temperature range of 350 to 400 K, utilizing a water closed loop heat source and multiple thermosyphon evaporator geometries. A gas gap calorimeter was used to measure heat flow at steady state. Thermocouples in the closed loop heat source and on the evaporator were used to measure thermal conductance. The interfaces were in two generic categories, those immersed in the water closed loop heat source and those clamped to the water closed loop heat source with differing <b>thermal</b> conductive <b>agents.</b> In general, immersed evaporators showed better overall performance than their clamped counterparts. Selected clamped evaporator geometries offered promise...|$|R
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{investigation}} on sweating process in human muscular exercise, the author compared sweating due to <b>thermal</b> <b>agents</b> with that due to muscular exercise using continuous recording method of sweat rate (the Kuno's method); we used a bicycle-ergometer being the experimental load. The experimental results are generally accepted and as follows: (1) The part of the chest skin covering M. pectoralis major {{was used for the}} index of the thermal sweating, while that of the palm as the mental or sensory perspiration was used. Both sweatings were found to appear simultaneously. (2) The latent periods were very short (within 5 min.) and then the sweat rates increased rapidly. (3) The sweating in the chest or the palm continued for long time (15 ～ 50 min.) after the cessation of 20 minutes' exercise (800 kg. m/min.). (4) The conditions of those sweatings were influenced by such factors as seasons, the ambient temperature, etc. The above results (2) and (3) were certainly related with adrenaline activities and accordingly small doses of adrenaline (0. 1 ～ 0. 4 mg.) were administrated subcutaneously just before and during the exercise under specified constant conditions. The results obtained for the effects of adrenaline upon the muscular exercise are as follows: 1) The effect of the adrenaline injection was recognized rather on the chest sweating than on the palm sweating. 2) In spite of the considerable individual differences seen in sweating activity, the sweat rate during the exercise period was increased by injection of the smallest dose of adrenaline (0. 1 ～ 0. 2 mg.), while that sweat rate was decreased by injection of some dose over 0. 2 ～ 0. 3 mg. and resulted always in a depression of the activity. 3) A tendency to lengthen the period of sweating after the cessation of exercise was observed in each case of adrenaline administration irrespective of the increase or decrease in sweating action during the exercise period. 4) The injection caused hardly any recognized effect on the latent period. In short, adrenaline plays some part in the sweating either during exercise or in recovery phase, but {{it has nothing to do}} with the latent period of sweating, so probably we should seek some other factors for these experimental facts...|$|R
