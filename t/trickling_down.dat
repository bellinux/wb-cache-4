25|$|As I {{walked down}} {{at this place}} I was walled on both sides by those {{inaccessible}} high rocky barren hills which hang over one’s head in some places and appear very terrible; and from them springs many little currents {{of water from the}} sides and clefts which trickle down to some lower part where it runs swiftly over the stones and shelves in the way, which makes a pleasant rush and murmuring noise and like a snowball is increased by each spring <b>trickling</b> <b>down</b> on either side of those hills, and so descends into the bottoms which are a Moorish ground in which in many places the waters stand, and so form some of those Lakes as it did here.|$|E

As she continues to caress her upper-body, an array of light imagery is projected behind her, serving as a backdrop. During the second verse, the video begins to use symmetrical visual arts. Beyoncé appears {{standing in front of}} a purple background, draped by large and billowing garments. As the song progresses, her emotions are heightened; zoomed shots of tears <b>trickling</b> <b>down</b> her cheeks are shown. A man appears behind Beyoncé and begins closely embracing her in endearment. The man is nondescript, and his muscular arms grip Beyoncé's body before taking her through a series of dips and bends, while he remains mostly in the background. With tears still rolling down her cheeks, Beyoncé chants to her love interest to make love to her on the song's vocal finale. As the guitar melodies close the song, Beyoncé is seen engulfed by the colorful light and special effects. The video ends with the camera returning to a glistening Beyoncé with blackened scenery in the background.|$|E

40|$|Neoliberal theory rationalizes {{inequality}} as both 1) {{necessary for}} growth and 2) offset by a <b>trickle</b> <b>down</b> to lower income groups. However, benefits from income growth failed to reach most of the population {{for the last several}} decades in the United States. Instead, a negative <b>trickle</b> <b>down</b> has lowered many people's wellbeing. The first aspect of negative <b>trickle</b> <b>down</b> is a new form of Veblen's conspicuous consumption with positional goods. The second is the effect on the provision of public goods. The third is the competition for limited resources, such as housing.

However, with only about 100 tons a day required, PAVN could keep its war-fighters in business indefinitely. [...] Amounts ten times or more this size however, were entering the top of the logistical pipeline before <b>trickling</b> <b>down</b> into South Vietnam, Laos and adjoining border regions.

2500|$|Although not {{originally}} a big seller, the album has been enormously influential {{since it was}} released. In 1971, publication Beat Instrumental & International Recording wrote: [...] "Pet Sounds took everyone by surprise. In terms of musical conception, lyric content, production and performance, it stood as a landmark in a music genre whose development {{was about to begin}} snowballing." [...] That same year, Cue magazine reflected that [...] "in the year and a half that followed Pet Sounds, the Beach Boys were among the vanguard... anticipating changes that rock didn't accomplish until 1969–1970." [...] In 1995, a panel of numerous musicians, songwriters and producers assembled by MOJO voted Pet Sounds as the greatest album among them. Writer Rachael Maddux discussed the album's impact in 2011: [...] "These days, the legacy of Pet Sounds looms so large that you can't always be sure if what you're hearing takes a direct line from the album itself or if it pulls from a second tier one of {{the hundreds of thousands of}} its beneficiaries now <b>trickling</b> <b>down</b> their own influence." ...|$|E
