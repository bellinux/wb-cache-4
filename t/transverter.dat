50|$|In Bell System {{telephone}} exchanges, {{particularly the}} 5XB switches, {{information from the}} marker told the sender that the call required ANI, and stored the calling equipment number in reed relay packs in the sender. The sender used the <b>transverter</b> connector (TVC) to seize a <b>transverter</b> (TV), which was a bay {{of a few hundred}} flat spring relays that controlled all AMA functions. The TV looked in the AMA translator (AMAT) that took care of these particular few thousand lines. AMAT was a rack of ferrite ring cores with cross-connect wires passing through holes of 3 × 4 inches or about a decimeter square, one wire per line. The wire was terminated on a wire wrap peg representing that particular line, and passed through a ring that represented the NNX digits of the billing number, then the M, C, D and finally Units of that number. When queried, AMAT sent a high-current pulse through the wire for that particular line, inducing pulses in the appropriate rings which were amplified by a cold cathode tube amplifier and then by a relay, and sent back to the <b>transverter</b> which supplied it to the sender for transmission by ANI to the tandem office.|$|E

40|$|Hundreds of Ku-Band Qualcomm 1 watt power {{amplifiers}} have been modified and {{found their way}} into Amateur microwave applications over the last 10 + years. The continued availability and relatively low cost of these units has made them popular for use in 10 GHz beacons, repeaters, homebrew <b>transverters</b> and as a power boost for the commercially available 10 GHz <b>transverters.</b> For a first experience in microstrip retuning, this is a good project as the conversion process is well documented, many Hams experienced at the process exist, and the policy of the SDMG is to replace any material that does not survive the modification process for the cost of postage.

50|$|Amateurs who are {{involved}} in contesting use home-made or commercially available <b>transverters</b> to operate CW and SSB on {{the lower end of the}} band, either just above 903 MHz or just above 902 MHz. SSB/CW operations usually use horizontal polarization for most contacts. VHF/UHF contests are conducted by the ARRL several times each year to encourage operations across all ham bands. Contacts must be made in the simplex mode - that is, without using a repeater. Any mode (FM, SSB, CW) can be used. Contact scoring is higher for 33 cm than the lower bands (6m through 70 cm).|$|R

50|$|A {{particular}} station {{automation device}} used in VHF and microwave contest stations {{is known as}} a sequencer. A sequencer uses a series of relays to switch a number of components from their reception state to their transmission state.

5000|$|Transverters {{are used}} in amateur radio to convert radio {{transceivers}} designed for use on the HF or VHF bands to operate on even higher frequency (microwave) bands. A transceiver used in this fashion {{is referred to as}} an IF radio, indicating its role as the [...] "intermediate frequency" [...] stage in the chain of radio electronics. Common transceiver/transverter combinations include transverters for 50 MHz, 70 MHz, 144 MHz, 222 MHz, and 432 MHz designed for use with 28 MHz IF radios, and transverters for 50 MHz, 902 MHz, 1296 MHz, 2304 MHz, 3456 MHz, 5706 MHz, and 10368 MHz designed for use with 144 MHz IF radios. Some <b>transverter</b> units include transmit/receive switching built into the design, whereas other units require external switching. The use of external switching is popular in applications where preamps and amplifiers are included. Many transverters are built into waterproof enclosures for installation on a radio tower or other antenna support structure to get the device {{as close as possible to}} the antenna so as to reduce signal loss in the transmission line.|$|E

WA 5 VJB 1 borrowed the idea from a <b>transverter</b> by DJ 6 EP and DC 0 DA 2 and published some measured data which was enough to get others started. I used ” pipe-cap filters in a 10 GHz mixer 3 and ” pipe-cap filters in a 5760 MHz mixer 4, 5, but my implementations were cut-and-try. I later expanded these mixers into single-board transverters: one 6 for 5760 with five pipe-caps, and then one 7 for 10. 368 GHz with seven ” pipe-cap filters plus two ” caps in the LO chain. The number of filters was needed to get adequate selectivity on both transmit and receive without excessive filter loss, plus some margin to allow for reproducibility, since neither the selectivity nor the loss was well quantified. Both single-board transverters have been improved by Down-East Microwave 8 and made available in kit or finished form. The DB 6 NT 9 10 GHz <b>transverter</b> uses a similar style of filter...|$|E
