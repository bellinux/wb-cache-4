25|$|When {{a surface}} {{is exposed to}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation above a certain <b>threshold</b> <b>frequency</b> (typically visible light for alkali metals, near ultraviolet for other metals, and extreme ultraviolet for non-metals), the radiation is absorbed and electrons are emitted.|$|E
25|$|Above the <b>threshold</b> <b>frequency,</b> {{the maximum}} kinetic {{energy of the}} emitted {{photoelectron}} depends on {{the frequency of the}} incident light, but is independent of the intensity of the incident light so long as the latter is not too high.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, Albert Einstein solved this {{apparent}} paradox by describing light as composed of discrete quanta, now called photons, rather than continuous waves. Based upon Max Planck's theory of black-body radiation, Einstein theorized {{that the energy}} in each quantum of light was equal to the frequency multiplied by a constant, later called Planck's constant. A photon above a <b>threshold</b> <b>frequency</b> has the required energy to eject a single electron, creating the observed effect. This discovery led to the quantum revolution in physics and earned Einstein the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. By wave-particle duality the effect can be analyzed purely in terms of waves though not as conveniently.|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} of the Critical Flicker <b>Frequency</b> <b>threshold</b> is used to study the visual temporal resolution in healthy subjects and in pathological conditions. To better understand {{the role played by}} different cortical areas in the Critical Flicker <b>Frequency</b> <b>threshold</b> perception we used continuous Theta Burst Stimulation (cTBS), an inhibitory plasticity-inducing protocol based on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The Critical Flicker <b>Frequency</b> <b>threshold</b> was measured in twelve healthy subjects before and after cTBS applied over different cortical areas in separate sessions. cTBS over the left inferior parietal lobule altered the Critical Flicker <b>Frequency</b> <b>threshold,</b> whereas cTBS over the left mediotemporal cortex, primary visual cortex and right inferior parietal lobule left the Critical Flicker <b>Frequency</b> <b>threshold</b> unchanged. No statistical difference was found when the red or blue lights were used. Our findings show that left inferior parietal lobule is causally involved in the conscious perception of Critical Flicker Frequency and that Critical Flicker <b>Frequency</b> <b>threshold</b> can be modulated by plasticity-inducing protocols. © 2014 Nardella et al...|$|R

25|$|For a given metal, {{there exists}} a certain minimum {{frequency}} of incident radiation below which no photoelectrons are emitted. This frequency is called the <b>threshold</b> <b>frequency.</b> Increasing {{the frequency of the}} incident beam, keeping the number of incident photons fixed (this would result in a proportionate increase in energy) increases the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons emitted. Thus the stopping voltage increases. The number of electrons also changes because the probability that each photon results in an emitted electron is a function of photon energy. If the intensity of the incident radiation of a given frequency is increased, there is no effect on the kinetic energy of each photoelectron.|$|E
25|$|The {{electroscope}} is {{an important}} tool in illustrating the photoelectric effect. For example, if the electroscope is negatively charged throughout, there is an excess of electrons and the leaf is separated from the stem. If high-frequency light shines on the cap, the electroscope discharges and the leaf will fall limp. This is because {{the frequency of the}} light shining on the cap is above the cap's <b>threshold</b> <b>frequency.</b> The photons in the light have enough energy to liberate electrons from the cap, reducing its negative charge. This will discharge a negatively charged electroscope and further charge a positive electroscope. However, if the electromagnetic radiation hitting the metal cap does not have a high enough frequency (its frequency is below the threshold value for the cap), then the leaf will never discharge, no matter how long one shines the low-frequency light at the cap.|$|E
25|$|In 1887, Heinrich Hertz {{observed}} that when light with sufficient frequency hits a metallic surface, it emits electrons. In 1902, Philipp Lenard {{discovered that the}} maximum possible energy of an ejected electron {{is related to the}} frequency of the light, not to its intensity: if the frequency is too low, no electrons are ejected regardless of the intensity. Strong beams of light toward the red end of the spectrum might produce no electrical potential at all, while weak beams of light toward the violet end of the spectrum would produce higher and higher voltages. The lowest frequency of light that can cause electrons to be emitted, called the <b>threshold</b> <b>frequency,</b> is different for different metals. This observation is at odds with classical electromagnetism, which predicts that the electron's energy should be proportional to the intensity of the radiation. So when physicists first discovered devices exhibiting the photoelectric effect, they initially expected that a higher intensity of light would produce a higher voltage from the photoelectric device.|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} in two parts, {{the first portion}} of which {{describes}} experiments which were carried out to detect a positive photo-electric emission from potassium. The result of these was that if such an emission occurs it is {{of the order of}} 10 times the negative emission at most, i. e. a thousand times as small as the value found by Dember, who claimed to have definite evidence Of a photo-electric effect. The major portion concerns the two or wore <b>threshold</b> <b>frequencies</b> of potassium. A brief historical account is given ending with the work of Richardson and Young in which they predict for the sensitised potassium surface a threshold at 10, 000 AU and another at 30, 000 AU. Precautions were taken to obtain a clean surface in a high vacuum, the apparatus being of a form which made the saturation of the photo-electric currents easy and the potassium was subjected to approximately black body radiation.

2500|$|Instead, {{electrons}} are dislodged {{only by the}} impingement of photons {{when those}} photons reach or exceed a <b>threshold</b> <b>frequency</b> (energy). Below that threshold, no electrons are emitted from the material regardless of the light intensity or {{the length of time}} of exposure to the light (rarely, an electron will escape by absorbing two or more quanta. However, this is extremely rare because by the time it absorbs enough quanta to escape, the electron will probably have emitted the rest of the quanta.). To make sense of the fact that light can eject electrons even if its intensity is low, Albert Einstein proposed that a beam of light is not a wave propagating through space, but rather a collection of discrete wave packets (photons), each with energy hν. This shed light on Max Planck's previous discovery of the Planck relation (...) linking energy (E) and frequency (ν) as arising from quantization of energy. The factor h is known as the Planck constant.|$|E

The mechanisms for their precise timing {{are not well}} understood. Here, we show that population bursts in the disinhibited CA 3 region are initiated at a threshold level of population firing after recovery from a previous event. Each population dis-charge follows an active buildup periodwhen synaptic traffic and cell firing increase to threshold levels. Sin-gle-cell firing can advance burst onset by increasing population firing to suprathreshold values. Population synchrony is suppressed when <b>threshold</b> <b>frequencies</b> cannot be reached due to reduced cellular excitability or synaptic efficacy. Reducing synaptic strength re-veals partially synchronous population bursts that are curtailed by GABAB-mediated conductances.
