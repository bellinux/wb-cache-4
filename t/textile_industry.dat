5|$|Historically, {{the economy}} of the Trafford {{dominated}} by agriculture. This continued to some extent even during the Industrial Revolution, as the <b>textile</b> <b>industry</b> in Trafford did not develop as quickly or to the same extent {{as it did in the}} rest of Greater Manchester. There are only two known 18th-century mill sites in Trafford, compared with 69 known in Tameside and 51 in Manchester. After reaching a high of 43% in 1812, employment in the <b>textile</b> <b>industry</b> in Trafford declined to 12% according to the 1851 census. The <b>textile</b> <b>industry</b> in Trafford could not compete with that in places such as Manchester, Oldham, and Ashton-under-Lyne, partly because of a reluctance to invest in industry on the part of the two main land owners in the area: the Stamfords and the de Traffords.|$|E

With increasing attention on segmentation, more and more bases for segmenting markets have been suggested {{in the past few}} decades.

This study explored the segmentation strategies and bases used in the <b>textiles</b> <b>industry</b> by collecting data using an empirical survey of the UK <b>textiles</b> <b>industry.</b> This empirical study also investigated confusing issues affecting successful implementation of a segmentation strategy in the <b>textiles</b> <b>industry</b> so that it can provide guidelines and a framework for marketing practitioners and for future research.

40|$|Quality is the watchword of {{any type}} of business. A product without quality leads to lack of {{customer}} satisfaction and ultimately to loss. This is true in case of <b>textile</b> <b>industries</b> also. In <b>textile</b> <b>industries,</b> quality maintenance {{is one of the}} major problems for fabric manufacturers. Currently in indigenous small scale <b>textile</b> <b>industries</b> manual or semi- automatic processes are being carried out. The fabric obtained from such processes lacks consistency in quality, moreover these industries have semi- skilled or unskilled labors, therefore stringent supervision is required. Normal automation solutions for such industries will be unaffordable. Therefore it is required to provide economical, reliable and robust automation solution to such industries. This paper addresses the need of factory automation within the scope of machine control for small scale <b>textile</b> <b>industries.</b> The project presents the design of LabVIEW based SCADA system for centralized control. It makes use of PLC as a field controller to operate the prototype design of Stenter Machine, widely used in <b>textile</b> <b>industries.</b> LabVIEW, which is a commonly accepted graphical user interface environment, also provides HMI front end. The PLC controller and the LabVIEW based SCADA are communicating through the RS- 232 link. The control system is flexible and modular. Due to the intuitive programming of LabVIEW, this system is cost efficient and reliable solution for automation of small scale <b>textile</b> <b>industries...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{introduction}} of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution initiated {{a process of}} rapid and unplanned urbanisation. A building boom began in Crompton during the mid-19th century, when suitable land for factories in Oldham was becoming scarce. By the late 19th century Crompton had emerged as a densely populated mill town. Forty-eight cotton mills—some {{of the largest in}} the United Kingdom—have been recorded as existing in the area. At its spinning zenith, {{as a result of an}} interwar economic boom associated with the <b>textile</b> <b>industry,</b> Shaw and Crompton was reported to have had more millionaires per capita than any other town in the world. Imports of foreign cotton goods began the decline in the region's <b>textile</b> <b>industry</b> during the mid-20th century; Shaw and Crompton's last mill closed in 1989.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} the Industrial Revolution was marked by a massive boom in the <b>textile</b> <b>industry,</b> with {{remarkable}} technological innovations made, led by the cotton industry of Great Britain.
