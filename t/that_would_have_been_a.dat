25|$|Meanwhile, {{the queen}} showed {{increasing}} signs of mental instability. On , seventeen doctors signed a document declaring her unable {{to manage the}} kingdom, with no prospect for her condition to improve. John was reluctant to take the reins of power, rejecting {{the idea of a}} formal regency. This opened the way for elements of the nobility to form a de facto government via a Council. Rumors circulated that John exhibited symptoms of the same insanity, and that he might be prevented from ruling. According to longstanding laws that guided the institution of regency, were the regent to die or become incapable for any reason, and having children of less than fourteen years (which was John's situation at the time), government would be exercised by the guardians of those children or, if guardians had not been formally named, by the wife of the regent.

25|$|News {{that the}} AAFC would be disbanded after the 1949 season {{dampened}} {{attendance at the}} championship game, which Cleveland won 21–7. The Browns scored their first touchdown early {{in the first quarter}} on a short rush by Edgar Jones. Cleveland's offense sputtered in the second quarter, however, never advancing beyond their own 38-yard line, and the score remained 7–0 at halftime. A 68-yard rush by Motley for a touchdown gave the Browns a 14–0 lead in the third quarter despite slippery conditions that limited passing and made running difficult. The 49ers came back in the fourth quarter with a 73-yard touchdown drive that ended with throw by Albert to Paul Salata for the score. Cleveland then scored again after the next kickoff, however, an 11-play drive capped by a Dub Jones touchdown with six minutes left {{that turned out to be}} the last in the AAFC's four-season history. Cleveland's defense had a strong game, limiting the 49ers to just 122 rushing yards and 108 passing yards. Warren Lahr batted down a pass from Albert to Salata in the third quarter <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> touchdown if he had caught it. Graham threw for 128 yards in the game and rushed for 62 yards. The win gave the Browns the AAFC championship for the fourth time in the league's four years of existence.|$|E
