In his own work, Giddens focuses on production and reproduction of social practices in some context.

He examined spatial organization, intended and unintended consequences, skilled and knowledgeable agents, discursive and <b>tacit</b> <b>knowledge,</b> dialectic of control, actions with motivational content, and constraints. Structuration theorists conduct analytical research of social relations, rather than organically discovering them, since they use structuration theory to reveal specific research questions, though that technique has been criticized as cherry-picking.|$|E
2500|$|Explicit {{knowledge}} is the [...] "what" [...] of know-how: knowledge {{such as the}} professional or vocational skills that are recorded in manuals, textbooks, and training courses. <b>Tacit</b> <b>knowledge,</b> on the other hand, is the non-technical [...] "how" [...] of getting things done—what Edward de Bono, the inventor of lateral thinking, calls operacy, or the skill of action, and what Peter Drucker identifies {{in the use of}} the word techne, the Greek for [...] "skill". Much of it is implicit and ambiguous, acquired largely by functional, context-specific experience. Typically existing only in the minds of individuals, <b>tacit</b> <b>knowledge</b> is normally very difficult to capture, with most organizations depending almost entirely on the explicit knowledge. This makes experiential learning, productivity gains, and competitiveness slow and expensive to acquire. In business terms, <b>tacit</b> <b>knowledge</b> is a passive misnomer for active sharing of knowledge to make an organization more effective. Training programs, for instance, cannot be limited to a source-recipient model, and should leverage mutual exchanges across generations.|$|E
2500|$|Given {{the high}} levels of {{corporate}} amnesia in commerce and industry, some organizations are turning to new techniques to preserving their organizational memory and, in particular, their <b>tacit</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The latest capture tools to get attention are the traditional corporate history, usually produced once or twice every 100 years as a public relations medium; and oral debriefing, an augmentation of the old-fashioned prescriptive and formulaic exit interview. Instead of hagiography, organizational memory is being produced as an induction and educational tool that transmits long-term information. Oral debriefing, which concentrates on short- and medium-term memory, targets exiting and key occupant employees, recurring corporate events, and important projects in detailed testimony of participants. Both are designed to extract <b>tacit</b> <b>knowledge</b> in an easily accessible format that also generates the [...] "lessons of history". Its permanent character also means that it {{does not have to be}} continually reproduced, just updated, and that its necessary re-interpretation alongside changing circumstances is predicated on a more reliable evidential base.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The role of {{involvement}} of knowledge {{as well as}} reusable knowledge in the software engineering environment has been analyzed.

40|$|Introduction It is {{generally}} accepted in software companies (throughout the organization structure) that existing knowledge is not utilized enough.

In our earlier research (Tervonen and Kerola, 1998) we outlined the quality-based approach, {{which was based on}} shared <b>tacit</b> quality <b>knowledge</b> and shareable explicit quality knowledge, and especially on dynamic interaction in the development and use of <b>tacit</b> and explicit <b>knowledge.</b> In this paper we adopt a more concrete approach and illustrate how quality knowledge (lessons learned in software inspection) can be captured and reused during the inspection process.

40|$|Healthcare is a knowledge-intensive field. A {{significant}} quantum {{of extremely}} vital and viable healthcare knowledge {{exists in a}} tacit form, yet due to various operational and technical reasons such healthcare knowledge is not entirely utilized and put into professional practice. The strong increase in expert work and knowledge-intensive fields make examining the topic timely and hypothetically interesting. The most significant contribution {{of this study is}} the increase in understanding, as well as, <b>tacit</b> healthcare <b>knowledge</b> sharing amongst physicians and clinicians with the type of collaborative tools and technologies they have at their disposal. Collaborative tools and technologies help employees of an organization work closely with their colleagues, partner organization and other volunteers as <b>tacit</b> healthcare <b>knowledge</b> sharing among clinicians such as sharing of best practices, tips and tricks, inter professional collaborative networking, clinical experiences and skills are known to {{have a significant impact on}} the quality of medical diagnosis and decisions. This paper posits that collaboration tools and technologies can provide new opportunities for <b>tacit</b> healthcare <b>knowledge</b> sharing amongst health-experts, and demonstrates this by presenting findings from a review of relevant literature and a survey conducted with Medical Doctors who have moderate to high interaction with collaborative tools and technologies in the healthcare industry. Semi-structure interviews were conducted with health-experts (Medical Doctors and clinicians) of Akademiska Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. Final thematic analysis unveiled six themes as potential contributors of collaborative tools and technologies in facilitating <b>tacit</b> healthcare <b>knowledge</b> sharing among clinicians.

Actually, the image embodiment in this work can always exceed the rhetoric of reconnaissance supported by the syllogistic rhetoric and disturb the identity framework of the nord-american community. The beholders’ reflecting shape on the Memorial can become, finally, an unreadable and pathetic index, or be perceived as a figural imprint, ephemeral and troubling; these disembodied pictures can achieve a medial incarnation – e. g. a Verkörperung – of the underworld...|$|R
