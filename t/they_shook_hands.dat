5|$|Soriano's final {{assignment}} was command of I Corps and Fort Lewis, beginning in August 2002. Under his leadership, Fort Lewis became a force provider for Operation Iraqi Freedom, {{including the first}} deployment of the Stryker with the 2nd Infantry Division. In June 2004, as the commander of Fort Lewis, Soriano ordered the court-martial of Ryan G. Anderson, {{who was convicted of}} providing aid to al-Qaeda and was sentenced in September 2004 to life in prison with the possibility of parole after Soriano removed the death penalty as a possible sentencing option. In September 2004, Soriano met with Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo at Malacanang, who he had met before during Arroyo's state visit in May 2003,As <b>they</b> <b>shook</b> <b>hands,</b> the President said Soriano thanked her for going to his hometown of Alcala, Pangasinan to save his fellow townmates from discrimination after the countrys first two reported deaths from Sever Acute Respiratory Syndrome were from Alcala. }} after being invited by General Narciso Abaya, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

500|$|At the {{interrogation}} centre he was poorly fed and physically weakened. It {{was part of}} the German technique for weakening resistance to interrogation. The Germans had prepared a file on all famous RAF personnel based on information from British newspapers. They knew most of what had happened in his career and private life. While there, he was interrogated by the aide of Reichsmarshall Hermann Göring. The German questioned him about British defences and Supermarine Spitfires, {{as he was about to}} resume operations on Ju 88s. Jokingly, Braham advised him to steer clear of Spitfires. While at Oberursel the pilot who had shot him down—Leutnant Robert Spreckels of Jagdgeschwader 1 (JG 1 Fighter Wing 1)— arrived to meet him. Braham was one of his 12 air victories; a figure of 45 is often misquoted. An interpreter was provided. Braham promised to buy him a whisky when the Allies won the war. The statement came as a shock to Spreckels who believed firmly in a German victory. Braham came to respect Spreckels, their differences aside. He learned that Spreckels had lost his parents in a British air attack and was surprised when the German dismissed the fact with the words [...] "it is the war." [...] Both fighter pilots dissociated themselves with the bomber war. <b>They</b> <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> and parted.|$|E

500|$|Michaels {{returned}} to WWE programming {{in a series}} of segments that aired on the August 10, 2009 episode of Raw, where he had, in storyline, left the WWE. Triple H met with Michaels at an office cafeteria in Texas where he was working as a chef; throughout the segments, Triple H would try to convince Michaels to return to WWE and reform DX. After several incidents during the segments, Michaels agreed to team with Triple H to face The Legacy (Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase) at SummerSlam. At the pay-per-view event, DX defeated Legacy. The two teams would exchange victories, with their feud concluding in October. Two months later, at , DX defeated Chris Jericho and Big Show to win the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match (TLC). On the January 4, 2010 episode of Raw, Michaels buried the hatchet with long-time rival Bret Hart, as <b>they</b> <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> and hugged in the ring. In contrast to the storylines featured on the show, this was in fact a real-life reconciliation which laid to rest animosities surrounding the Montreal Screwjob. While some cast doubts on its sincerity, both men have confirmed that it was indeed genuine. DX lost the Unified Tag Team Championship in a Triple Threat match to the team of The Miz and Big Show on the February 8 episode of Raw, the match also included The Straight Edge Society (CM Punk and Luke Gallows). At the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, Michaels cost The Undertaker the World Heavyweight Championship in the main event. At WrestleMania XXVI, Michaels lost to The Undertaker and, as a result, he was forced to retire due to the match stipulation, the same way HBK ended Ric Flair's career. The following night, on the March 29 episode of Raw, Michaels gave an emotional farewell speech, departing with the familiar sentence, [...] "Shawn Michaels has left the building." ...|$|E

Inside the building were owner Michel Catalano and a male employee, 26-year-old graphics designer Lilian Lepère. Catalano told Lepère to go hide in the building and remained in his office himself. Not long after, a salesman named Didier went to the printworks on business. Catalano came out with Chérif Kouachi who introduced himself as a police officer. <b>They</b> <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> and Kouachi told Didier, [...] "Leave. We don't kill civilians anyhow."

2500|$|ZANU-PF {{and both}} groups of the MDC signed a Memorandum of Understanding {{outlining}} a framework for talks on 21 July in Harare. Both Mugabe and Tsvangirai were present to sign the agreement; <b>they</b> <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> on this occasion, and it was reportedly {{the first time they}} had met in about 10 years. According to Mbeki, who was also present, the agreement [...] "commits the negotiating parties to an intense program of work to try and finalize negotiations as quickly as possible". Mugabe said that the aim of the talks was to [...] "chart a new way, a new way of political interaction", while Tsvangirai described the agreement as [...] "the first tentative step towards searching for a solution for a country that is in crisis". Under the terms of the agreement, the parties agreed to end political violence and work towards a national unity government and a new constitution; the agreement also required that the parties not use the media as a means of negotiation and set the period for negotiations at two weeks. Mbeki's spokesman Mukoni Ratshitanga subsequently said {{that this was not a}} strict limit and talks could continue after two weeks if necessary.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1916 Lloyd George (then War Secretary) sought French's {{advice about}} recent press {{criticism}} of British artillery and discipline, then {{sent him to}} France to sound out {{the opinion of the}} French generals about why the French had gained ground with fewer losses on the Somme. Foch (C-in-C French Army Group North) refused to be drawn, although he confessed to Wilson that Haig's methods invited criticism, and Haig refused to meet him, sending an aide Lt-Col Alan Fletcher, telling him [...] "I would not receive Viscount French in my house. I despise him too much personally for that, but he would receive every attention due to a British Field Marshal". [...] Haig and Robertson were both concerned that Lloyd George might appoint French CIGS in Robertson's place. [...] On 25 November 1916 the King summoned French to Buckingham Palace and warned him to stop criticising Haig. In January 1917 French refused an invitation from Derby to dine with Haig, but on 22 June, after pressure from the King, a meeting was arranged for French and Haig to bury the hatchet, at which, by Haig's account, French confessed that in his bitterness at being removed from command he had [...] "said things then which he was ashamed of now".

Fitzwilliam replied the next day that domestic matters took charge of his attention but on 28 June that he let Beresford know he was now in town and [...] "As I could not misunderstand the object of your letter, I have only to signify that I am ready to attend your call". Rumours of the impending duel leaked and Fitzwilliam was [...] "obliged to quit the house...hastily in the morning, for fear of arrest by the police". His second, Lord George Cavendish, met Beresford's second (Sir George Montgomery) on 28 June and debated an apology by Fitzwilliam. His proposed apology was not acceptable to Beresford. Their first arena, Marylebone fields, was crowded with prospective spectators so they moved to a field near Paddington. As Beresford and Fitzwilliam were taking their marks a magistrate ran onto the field and arrested Fitzwilliam. Fitzwilliam said to Beresford [...] "that we have been prevented from finishing this business in the manner I wished, I have no scruple to make an apology". Beresford accepted and <b>they</b> <b>shook</b> <b>hands,</b> with Fitzwilliam saying [...] "Now, thank God, there is a complete end to my Irish administration" [...] and hoped that [...] "whenever they met it {{might be on the}} footing of friends". Burke wrote to Lord John Cavendish on 1 July that [...] "it is happy, that a Virtuous man has escaped with Life and honour—and that his reputation for spirit and humanity, and true dignity must stand higher than ever, if higher it could stand".|$|E
