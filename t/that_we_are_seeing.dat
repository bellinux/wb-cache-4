2500|$|During an {{interview}} John Stalker, Deputy Chief Constable of Greater Manchester {{in the early}} 1980s and himself a Detective Inspector in 1973, has stated that the depiction of the police [...] "has {{got nothing to do}} with real policing in the 1970s. It could not be more inaccurate in terms of procedure, the way they talk or the way they dress. In all the time I was in the CID in the 1970s I never saw a copper in a leather bomber jacket and I never heard an officer call anyone 'guv'.... Actually, there were a few police officers in London who started to behave like Regan and Carter in The Sweeney, but that was a case of life following art, not the other way round". The journalist who interviewed Stalker, Ray King, remarks that the depiction of the police can be defended if we assume that Sam is indeed in a coma and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> his imaginary idea of 1973, filtered through 1970s cop shows.|$|E

When we become like little children, our very playfulness tells <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> deep, when we see that God is love in His works {{as well as in}} Himself, and we look at Nature as a baby does, as a {{beautiful}} mystery which we scarcely wish to solve. And therefore deep things, which the intellect in vain struggles after, will reveal themselves to us.|$|E

Some intermittent sparking had occurred and we asked the technician to observe with a mirror around the protective concrete wall. He immediately signaled {{to turn off the}} synchrotron as [...] "he saw an arc in the tube." [...] The vacuum was still excellent, so Langmuir and I came {{to the end of the}} wall and observed. At first we thought it might be due to Cherenkov radiation, but it soon became clearer <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>seeing</b> Ivanenko and Pomeranchuk radiation.|$|R

The suggestion we are to examine is that such: beliefs have some recognizable quality which secures their truth, and the truth of whatever is deduced from them according to self-evident principles of inference. This theory is set forth, for example, by Meinong in his book, [...] "Ueber die Erfahrungsgrundlagen unseres Wissens." ...|$|E
6000|$|Of all quaint places {{this is one}} of {{the most}} charming. I have been rather troubled that antiquity has fled before me where I have gone. It is a {{fatality}} of travelling that the sense of novelty dies away, so that we do not realize <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> any thing extraordinary. I wanted to see something as quaint as Nuremberg in Longfellow's poem, and have but just found it. These high-gabled old Flemish houses, nine steps to each gable! The cathedral, too, affects me more in externals than any yet. And the spire looks as I expected that of Strasbourg would. As to the grammarye of bells and chimes, I deliver that over to Charlie. But--I have seen Rubens's painting! Before I came to Europe, Longfellow said to me, [...] "You must go to Antwerp, to see Rubens." ...|$|E

Against this background, the paper examines the provision of security as a commodity, which can give rise to different ethical dilemmas related to accountability, transparency and other issues of ‘good governance’...|$|R

5000|$|In October 2012, Hurricane Sandy {{caused a}} lot of damage to New York City, and many subway tunnels were {{inundated}} with floodwater. The subway opened with limited service two days after the storm and was running at 80 percent capacity within five days; however, some infrastructure needed years to repair. A year after the storm, MTA spokesperson Kevin Ortiz said, [...] "This was unprecedented in terms of the amount of damage <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>seeing</b> throughout the system." [...] The storm flooded nine of the system's 14 underwater tunnels, many subway lines, and several subway yards, as well as completely destroying a portion of the IND Rockaway Line and much of the South Ferry terminal station. Reconstruction required many weekend closures on several lines, as well as several long-term closures on the Greenpoint Tunnel, Montague Street Tunnel, Rockaway Line, and the South Ferry station, with a long-term closure planned for the 14th Street Tunnel; some reconstruction is expected to last until at least 2020. As a preventative measure, 68 subway entrances in Lower Manhattan are also receiving fabric plugs that are intended to keep flood water out.|$|R

50|$|Van Creveld {{notes that}} many of the wars fought after 1945 were low-intensity {{conflicts}} (LICs) which powerful states ended up losing. The book argues <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> a decline of the nation-state, without a comparable decline in organized violence. Moreover, in his view, armies consistently train and equip to fight a conventional war, rather than the LICs they are likely to face. Consequently, it is imperative that nation states change the training of their armed forces and rethink their weapon procurement programs.|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} three key, {{recently}} emergent sites of anti-austerity activism in Britain – Left Unity, the People’s Assembly and Occupy – {{in order to}} explore to what extent and in which ways the traditional British left {{is in the process}} of reconfiguring itself. More specifically, we explore the ‘points of contact’ being developed, or not, amongst feminist, anarchist and Marxist/socialist activists. <b>We</b> argue <b>that</b> if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>seeing</b> a mutation of the left at present, it concerns a noticeable (if partial and contested) ‘feminist turn’ in terms of the composition, ideas and practices of these sites...|$|R

This article outlines seven practices or principles which, according to studies of NPD practices and performance, will increase NPD productivity after they are embraced. These principles include familiar concepts such as building {{in the voice of}} the customer, front-end load-ing projects, and taking a more holistic approach to product innovation. However, while they are familiar, it is surprising how many firms have yet to embrace them. Other, less familiar, principles include: relying on spiral rather than linear development; building in metrics, team accountability and continuous improve-ment; and portfolio management techniques to yield higher value projects. Finally, a number of best performers are redesigning their idea-to-launch processes, moving to the next-generation Stage-Gate ® system; they employ methods borrowed from lean manufacturing to remove waste from their development processes, and they also make their processes scalable, flexible, adaptable, and more open to the external environment...|$|R

50|$|The known uranium {{resources}} {{represent a}} higher level of assured resources than is normal for most minerals. Further exploration and higher prices will certainly, on the basis of present geological knowledge, yield further resources as present ones are used up. There was very little uranium exploration between 1985 and 2005, so the significant increase in exploration effort <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> now <b>seeing</b> could readily double the known economic resources. On the basis of analogies with other metal minerals, a doubling of price from price levels in 2007 could be expected to create about a tenfold increase in measured resources, over time.|$|R
