5|$|All three {{ships of}} the Königsberg class served as {{training}} cruisers for naval cadets throughout the 1930s.

5|$|All work {{to put the}} I-185 into {{production}} was cancelled afterwards, even with the M-82 engine, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>all</b> required for the La-5 fighter. Another reason cited was that the La-5 used the fuselage of the Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov LaGG-3 which was already in production in three plants and would involve less disruption of the production lines. Another factor may have been that the La-5 required less duralumin to build, something in short supply at the time.|$|E
5|$|Around {{half of the}} Grenztruppen were conscripts, a lower {{proportion}} than {{in other}} branches of the East German armed forces.
