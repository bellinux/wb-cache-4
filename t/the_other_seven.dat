5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>seven</b> variables. If the location of the bike and the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E
5|$|As {{the coup}} collapsed, Kỳ and Đức {{appeared}} with other senior officers {{at a news}} conference where they proclaimed that the South Vietnamese military was united. They announced a resolution by the armed forces, signed by them and seven others, claiming a united front against corruption.

60|$|The gang who {{had seized}} me were rough-bearded fellows in fur caps and fustian jackets, with buff belts round their waists, from which hung short {{straight}} whinyards. Their dark sun-dried faces and their great boots marked them as fishermen or seamen, {{as might be}} guessed from their rude sailor speech. A pair knelt on either side with their hands upon my arms, a third stood behind with a cocked pistol pointed at my head, while <b>the</b> <b>others,</b> <b>seven</b> or eight in number, were helping to his feet the man whom I had struck, who was bleeding freely from a cut over the eye.|$|R

5|$|In February 1994, the Great Southern Hotel {{ended its}} {{operations}} {{from the building}} as the hotel faced increasing competition in the hospitality industry.

5|$|Located in {{the bottom}} of a narrow valley, the Nine Stones circle has a {{diameter}} of 9.1 metres by 7.8 metres (29 feet 10 inches by 25 feet 11 inches). It consists of nine irregularly spaced sarsen megaliths, with a small opening on its northern side. Two of the stones on the north-western side of the monument are considerably larger than <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>seven.</b> This architectural feature has parallels with various stone circles in south-western Scotland, and was potentially a deliberate choice of the circle's builders, to whom it may have had symbolic meaning.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon had {{calculated}} that Kutuzov, expecting reinforcements from Russia {{to defend its}} political allies, would withdraw toward Vienna; he envisioned that his and Kutuzov's armies would engage in a great battle at Vienna, and that this battle would decide the war. Consequently, Napoleon drew divisions from four of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>seven</b> corps of the Grande Armée {{to create a new}} VIII Corps. This corps was to secure the north shore of the Danube, block any of the Austrian or Russian groups from reinforcing one another and, more importantly, prevent Kutuzov from crossing the river and escaping to Russia.|$|E

5|$|The Italian {{composer}} Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643), {{in addition}} to a large output of church music and madrigals, wrote prolifically for the stage. His theatrical works were written between 1604 and 1643 and included ten operas, of which three—L'Orfeo (1607), Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (1640) and L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643)—have survived with their music and librettos intact. In the case of <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>seven</b> operas, the music has disappeared almost entirely, although some of the librettos exist. The loss of these works, written during a critical period of early opera history, has been much regretted by commentators and musicologists.|$|E
5|$|The {{survivors}} told Coast Guard {{officials that}} during the storm, one of the engines of the plane failed, along {{with most of the}} electrical power; as a result, the crew was unable to drop the reserve tank or close the bomb bay doors automatically.

5|$|After {{surveys of}} {{historic}} {{properties in the}} county, in 2008 the Hampshire County Historic Landmarks Commission and the Hampshire County Commission began an initiative to place structures and districts on the National Register of Historic Places. The county received funding from the State Historic Preservation Office of the West Virginia Division of Culture and History to survey and document its architecture and history. As {{a result of this}} initiative, Valley View {{was one of the first}} eight historic properties to be considered for placement on the register. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>seven</b> were Capon Chapel, Fort Kuykendall, Hickory Grove, Hook Tavern, North River Mills Historic District, Old Pine Church and Springfield Brick House. The house at Valley View was listed on the NRHP on December12, 2012.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, back at Parkside <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>seven</b> trains {{had come}} to a halt {{following}} the accident. The electrical telegraph had not yet been invented and no signalling system was in place advanced enough to communicate with Northumbrian, with Liverpool and Manchester, or with the party who had accompanied Huskisson to Eccles. The remaining passengers and railway staff congregated near the accident site to discuss how best to proceed. The L staff argued that since the railway was not at fault for the accident they should be allowed to continue to Manchester to prove the viability of the design. They also made the point that a large crowd would by now have gathered in Manchester, waiting to see the arrival of the trains and {{to get a glimpse of}} the Duke of Wellington. Joseph Sandars also suggested that, did the group not continue, the Manchester crowd would hear rumours of the accident and believe it to be more serious than it was. The Prime Minister and Sir Robert Peel, the Home Secretary, felt that it would be disrespectful to Huskisson to continue, and advocated that the group return to Liverpool to await news of Huskisson's condition.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the North Koreans {{intensified}} {{their attack}} on the 2nd Battalion on the road southwest of Yongdong. Concentrated artillery support, with the shells falling {{so close to the}} 2nd Battalion positions that they wounded four US troops, together with an attack by the 2nd Battalion, briefly opened the North Korean roadblock at 04:30 July 25, and the bulk of the battalion escaped to Yongdong. However, F Company of the 8th Cavalry, the 16th Reconnaissance Company, and the 1st Platoon of A Company, 71st Tank Battalion, {{at the rear of the}} column were cut off. Only four of 11 light tanks broke through the North Korean positions. Crews abandoned <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>seven</b> tanks and walked over the hills in a two days' journey as part of a group of 219 men, most of them from F Company. All equipment except individual arms was abandoned by this group. Others groups of US troops escaped in the same manner. The North Koreans had flanked the 1st Cavalry Division in a double envelopment and forced them to withdraw. In the process, the division lost much of its equipment in its quick withdrawal actions.|$|E

5|$|On 13 September 1782 the Bourbon allies {{launched}} their great attack; 5190 fighting men, both French and Spanish, aboard {{ten of the}} newly engineered 'floating batteries' with 138 heavy guns, as well as 18 ships of the line, 40 Spanish gunboats and 20 bomb-vessels {{with a total of}} 30,000 sailors and marines. They were supported by 86 land guns and 35,000 Spanish and French troops (7,000–8,000 French) on land intending to assault the fortifications once they had been demolished. The 138 guns opened fire from floating batteries in the Bay and the 86 guns on the land side, directed on the fortifications after weeks of preparatory artillery fire. But the garrison replied with red-hot shot to set fire to and sink the attacker's floating batteries and warships in the Bay. The British destroyed three of the floating batteries, which blew up as the 'red-hot shot' did its job. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>seven</b> batteries were scuttled by the Spanish. In addition 719 men on board the ships (many of whom drowned) were casualties.|$|E

Aki has {{a vision of the}} Phantom home planet, where she is able to receive the eighth spirit from the alien particles in herself. When Aki awakens, she and Gray combine it with <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>seven.</b> Hein continues to fire the Zeus cannon despite overheating warnings and unintentionally destroys the cannon and himself. Gray sacrifices himself as a medium needed to physically transmit the completed spirit into the alien Gaia. The Earth's Gaia is returned to normal as the Phantoms ascend into space, finally at peace. Aki is pulled from the crater holding Gray's body, and is seen looking into the newly liberated world.|$|E
