5|$|The episode {{begins in}} an {{abandoned}} warehouse, where Dean (Ackles) is attacked by the djinn that he is hunting. He suddenly finds himself {{in a world in}} which his mother (Smith) was not killed by the demon Azazel. He and his brother Sam (Jared Padalecki) were not raised to be hunters of supernatural creatures, but are no longer close, as Dean is irresponsible, disloyal, and drinks too much in this alternate reality; when a confused Dean calls him for help, Sam thinks that he is drunk. In the new reality, Dean is dating the beautiful Carmen (Michelle Borth), and Sam is at law school and engaged to Jessica (Palicki)another victim of Azazel. Although Dean enjoys his new life, a ghostly young woman seems to be haunting him and he is confronted by an image of corpses in his closet. He realizes that all <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> and Sam had saved as hunters are now dead, that he and Sam have a distant and somewhat adversarial relationship. After visiting the grave of his father John, who died the previous year of a stroke, Dean decides that he must give up his new-found happiness to save them.|$|E
5|$|The open cabildo {{was held}} on May 22, 1810; it was debated whether the viceroy should {{continue}} in office, and if not, who should replace him. The first opinion was from Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, who held that Cisneros should continue and that, if all of Spain was conquered by France, peninsulars were meant to rule in the Americas. Castelli made a counter-argument, based on {{the doctrine of the}} retroversion of the sovereignty of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had already employed in the defense of Paroissien. He insisted that {{in the absence of a}} legitimate authority, sovereignty should be returned to the people; they should govern themselves. The idea of dismissing the viceroy ultimately prevailed, but as Buenos Aires had no authority to decide unilaterally the new form of government, they would elect a provisional government. A congress of deputies called from all other cities would take the final decision. However, there were disputes over who should exercise the provisional government: some argued that the Cabildo should do so, and others that it should be a Junta. Castelli bowed to Saavedra's proposal to form a Junta, but with the proviso that the procurator of the Cabildo, Julián de Leiva, had a decisive vote in the appointment. By adding this proviso, Castelli sought to add the former supporters of Martín de Álzaga, such as Mariano Moreno, Domingo Matheu, and Leiva himself.|$|E
25|$|Muhammad, for his part, {{strove to}} {{convince}} <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was still acting in al-Musta'in's best interests, {{while at the}} same time continuing to negotiate with Abu Ahmad regarding the terms of surrender. On January 7, Muhammad and Abu Ahmad met in person under a canopy outside the Shammasiyah gate, and the two men agreed that the state revenues would be split among the parties, with two thirds going to the Turks and one third going to Muhammad and the Baghdadi army, and al-Musta'in should be held liable for part of the soldiers' pay. On the following day, Muhammad went to al-Musta'in and attempted to convince him to abdicate. At first al-Musta'in adamantly refused, but when the Turkish officers Wasif and Bugha stated that they had sided with Muhammad, he agreed to step down.|$|E

5000|$|Jason Lee said he {{was drawn}} to the show because the concept was {{original}} and the protagonist was fun to play. Lee said, [...] "The whole package was unique and once I came to found the character and the material and the scenarios and his relationships and he’s such a great guy and is so multi-layered and cares such a great deal for his city and his family and <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>he’s</b> protecting." [...] Lee listened to hundreds of Presley songs in preparation for the role, and said his respect for the artist grew as a result. [...] The vocals for Lee's character are sung by Mark Arnell.|$|R

25|$|In September 1921 Dhalla, {{accompanied}} by {{his wife and son}} (Nariman, who would eventually also study at Columbia), again proceeded to New York, this time to have his book Zoroastrian Civilization published. On the way, the family also spent four months in Iran and Iraq, where Dhalla again gave a series of lectures. Although Dhalla was appalled at the living conditions (not just of Zoroastrians), he found that the still-medieval infrastructure afforded him with opportunities for closer contacts with <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would have had with more modern forms of transportation. In New York, Dhalla delivered lectures whenever the opportunity arose. Following the publication of his book, Dhalla and family returned to Karachi via London, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, Milan, Rome, and Naples, and felt the effects of the war that had ended only three years previously. Following a five-week layover in Bombay, they returned to Karachi in July 1922.|$|E
25|$|After a century, Doro finally tracks Anyanwu {{down to a}} Louisiana plantation. To his surprise, Anyanwu {{has created}} her own colony, which in many ways is more {{successful}} than Doro's. She protects her people until Doro's arrival, at which point he forces his breeding program on her community. One man he brings to mate with one of Anyanwu’s daughters ruins the harmony of the colony, resulting in several deaths. Anyanwu becomes tired of Doro's control, since his immortality makes him the only permanent thing in her life. She decides to commit suicide. Her decision causes Doro to have a change of heart. In desperation, he agrees to compromise {{as long as she}} goes on living. From that point on, Doro no longer kills as carelessly to remain immortal, and does not choose his kills from <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> should be protecting. He also stops using Anyanwu to breed; from now on she helps him in his quest to try to find more promising seeds, but is more of an ally and partner than his slave.|$|E
500|$|Gagnon's {{fascination with}} Peru and the Asháninka [...] began after World War II, {{when he heard}} a bishop give a talk about them. He then worked for three years in a shoe factory and {{restaurant}} in New Hampshire to save money to allow him to visit Lima. In 1948, he came to Peru, entered the Franciscan order, and took the name Mariano. Gagnon was ordained a priest in 1957, and spent three years working with those who spoke Cocama, an indigenous language of Peru. He said of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> served, [...] "They are the most virtuous people I have ever met. They never lie and have great respect for personal property. Their language is very sharp. There is no word for 'maybe' in Campa." [...] He also observed that they did not chew coca leaves and were not prone to sharing food and drink, which had been a major cause of rampant tuberculosis. There was also a high infant mortality rate. By 1969, he had established two missions and began work on a third.|$|E

500|$|Hawk {{wins the}} gladiator tournament in Valhalla, gaining {{citizenship}} in the Center, and is asked by Hiroko {{to help her}} find a boy who has gone missing. Upon their failure to find him, they are escorted by Zayin to the Center, where they meet the Messian bishop. He reprimands Hiroko for acting independently and tells Hawk that his true identity is Aleph, the Messiah, who will save mankind and bring about the paradisiacal [...] "Thousand-Year Kingdom", and that Beth was sent by God as the Messiah's partner. The Center sends Aleph and Beth on missions across Tokyo Millennium to eradicate demons and prepare {{the world for the}} Thousand-Year Kingdom. They meet with Gimmel, and are shown Arcadia, a prototype of the Thousand-Year Kingdom. Returning to the Center, they learn that demons have invaded and that someone the bishop calls the Anti-Messiah is proclaiming to <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is the true Messiah. Aleph and Beth are sent to stop him, and learn that he is a man named Daleth. During the ensuing fight, Daleth nearly kills Aleph, but Beth sacrifices herself, allowing Aleph to regain the upper hand. Honoring Beth's dying wish, he spares Daleth, and is considered the true Messiah.|$|E
500|$|Ivan had {{previously}} been married to a woman and he enjoys flirting with females. One such moment is a flirtation with Jasmine Thomas (Jenna-Louise Coleman); they bond over her liking of the Brontë novels Wuthering Heights and Shirley. When Nicola Blackstock (Nicola Wheeler) confesses her attraction to Ivan, he tells her that it is her brother, Paul that he is interested in and kisses him on the cheek. Brocklebank told Laws that he had known Bose for six years prior to joining the serial and was also living with him. He {{said that it would}} be [...] "embarrassing" [...] if romance developed between their characters because of their friendship. However, the actor did think it was [...] "great" [...] to be given [...] "such a meaty storyline". Brocklebank told a reporter from <b>The</b> <b>People</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> dreaded to think what his grandmother would make of the storyline. He said he was interested to receive the reaction from viewers because [...] "it's a subject that hasn't been covered before". The actor later said that he found Ivan's bisexuality [...] "really interesting" [...] because he felt that it had not [...] "really been tackled in soaps before". Brocklebank later spoke of his belief that there was [...] "still a stigma attached to being bisexual" [...] and his hopes that Ivan's storyline would [...] "break some barriers" [...] around the issue.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{a legend}} about the [...] "Sum of All Men", {{a man with}} so many endowments and so beloved by <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> became immortal and {{retained}} all of his endowments even after the deaths of his Dedicates. The strengths of the people supposedly flowed to him unrestrained, somehow without draining the dedicates themselves of the attributes. The books refer to Daylan of the Black Hammer as the Sum of All Men, although in the sixth novel it is revealed that Daylan {{is in fact a}} Bright One from the Netherworld, rather than a mortal man with many endowments. It is also revealed that Daylan has a mere four endowments of Brawn, {{in stark contrast to the}} legends which claim he has a huge number. Daylan himself claims to have started these legends, though his purpose for doing so has not been revealed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{wind was}} rising {{at the start}} of the contest, and Le Martin, who was one of the most {{experienced}} aviators in France, rocked about a good deal as his machine left the ground and swept across the field. His aeroplane had reached the woods, a quarter of a mile beyond the barriers, when it was observed to pitch swiftly downward and into the trees. Le Martin was using a biplane, [...] which was broken badly as it fell at the foot of an oak tree. A corner of the motor struck Le Martin's head, crushing his skull, and his right leg was also broken in two places. The aviator was barely alive when he was taken away by Red Cross surgeons, whose stations surrounded the field. The crowds removed their hats as the wounded aviator was carried past, or as word passed among <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was dead. Le Martin was alive when he reached the hospital, but expired a few minutes afterwards.|$|E

60|$|No man since Washington {{has become}} to Americans so {{familiar}} or so beloved a figure as Abraham Lincoln.
