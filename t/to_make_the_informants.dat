40|$|Background: During {{the past}} few years nurses precepting {{undergraduate}} nursing students have been put under greater pressure because of increased number of students admitted to the universities combinedwith a shortage of clinical placements. One solution is the preceptor model peer learning where two students are tutored by the same preceptor simultaneously. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the variation of registered nurses' conceptions of preceptorship in a peer learning model for undergraduate nursing students. Design: The study used a qualitative descriptive design and a phenomenographic approach. Settings: The interviews took place at somatic and psychiatric units at two different hospitals in southern Sweden. Participants: Twelve informants participated who had worked as registered nurses between 1 – 17 years and acted as peer learning preceptors between 2 month and 6 years. Methods: Each nurse was interviewed individually using a semi structured interview guide. Follow up questions were used <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> develop and deepen their answers. Results: Four different descriptive categories emerged in the study: 1) Preceptorship in peer learning generates development and new perspectives 2) Preceptorship in peer learning enables student reflection and independence 3) Preceptorship in peer learning engenders insufficiency and stress 4) Preceptorship in peer learning requires education and support. Conclusions: The result of this study showed that preceptors conceived that peer learning enabled them to take a step backwhich gave thema new role and perspectives. The consequencewas that the students could be more independent which saved time for some of the preceptors. However, some preceptors perceived insufficiency and stress while working with two students. It is also important to educate both students and preceptors to optimise the use of peer learning...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{basis of}} this essay are taken from Goffmans (1959) theory about {{impression}} management. The theory is used to investigate the connection and the collision between separate roles. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine when collision between the bosses professional role and their private role occur and to examine how they handle these collisions. The extent of this study is focused mainly on bosses who are living and working in small districts. The choice of definition is <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> have actually experienced some degree of collision between their separate roles. The objective is to find out if bosses who are living and working in small districts can secure their anonymity and stay anonymous in public. A qualitative method is used for this study. And so called go-along interviews and focus Group interviews has been applied. The result of this study shows that bosses who are living and working in small districts are having trouble maintaining their anonymity. And therefore the most common choice made is to take up residence outside the work district. This is of great importance to be able to separate the professional role from the private and to maintain these two. The result clearly presents that collisions between the professional role and the private role are taking place and are quite common.  Henceforth strategies are used by bosses in this study to facilitate and avoid collisions. Bosses is using dramaturgical caution, to avoid execution of actions that can´t be adjusted quickly. Bosses in the conducted study are experiencing that collisions themselves aren't problematic which leads to the conclusion that they have a high level of dramaturgical discipline. In conclusion the main objective of this study has been obtained and the questions has been answered from Goffmans perspective regarding impression management. ...|$|R
40|$|Syftet med studien var att belysa hur patienter som strålats mot huvud- och halscancer upplevde sin orala hälsa efter avslutad strålbehandling. Studien är kvalitativ och består av intervjuer med åtta informanter. Intervjuerna har utförts med hjälp av en intervjuguide. Intervjuerna spelades in på bandspelare och varade i ca 10 - 20 minuter. Intervjumaterialet har analyserats med en kvalitativ innehållsanalys. Resultatet av studien visade att majoriteten av informanterna upplevde sin orala hälsa negativt efter avslutad strålbehandling, dessa benämns i fysisk effekt och psykisk begräsning. Informanterna upplevde smärta samt muntorrhet efter avslutad strålbehandling. Resultatet visade även att nutritionsbegränsingar uppstod och att de var tvungna till att göra kostförändringar, även sväljning och tuggning försvårades. Informanterna upplevde generellt att det var jobbigt att äta i stora sammanhang då rädslan för att sätta maten i halsen förekom.
