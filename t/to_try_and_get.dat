At 2 am on 20 August, the paths of the two ships crossed near Long Point. On board Ogdensburg, the first mate, Degrass McNeil, was on duty. He spotted lights from Atlantic but was sure that Ogdensburg would pass {{at least a half}} mile ahead of the other ship. But then Atlantic changed course, turning north as though trying to pass in front of Ogdensburg. McNeil ordered Ogdensburg engines reversed and the ship turned to port, and since Ogdensburg steam whistle was broken, McNeil ran out onto the ship's deck and yelled <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> the other ship to turn to starboard.|$|E

I would have made more of an effort <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> behind his [...] "mask" [...] and have a better relationship with him." [...] He said that he went home that night, watched the news on television with his children and cried most of the evening. In 1997, he said that Lennon's death made the remaining ex-Beatles nervous that they might also be murdered. He told Mojo magazine in 2002 that Lennon was his greatest hero. In 1981, McCartney sang backup on Harrison's tribute to their ex-bandmate, [...] "All Those Years Ago", which featured Starr on drums. McCartney released [...] "Here Today" [...] in 1982, a song Everett described as [...] "a haunting tribute" [...] to McCartney's friendship with Lennon.|$|E
500|$|In March 2008, Dale {{replaced}} Peter Davison in {{the lead}} role of King Arthur in the London West End production of Monty Python's Spamalot at the Palace Theatre. He accepted the role {{because he was a}} fan of Monty Python and considered that [...] "life's too short" [...] for him to have turned down a West End part. Although he has seen all of the shows and the other films, Dale had never seen Monty Python and the Holy Grail (from which Spamalot is [...] "lovingly ripped off") and had to buy a copy to prepare for the role. It was not his first experience in musical theatre because he appeared in a 1984 Australian production of Applause, but Dale found the comic timing of the part to be the hardest task. [...] "On stage, the battle is to find all of the humorous moments and not skip over them. [...] There's an art to Python humour and I'm aiming <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> every single joke just right." [...] He was succeeded in the role by Sanjeev Bhaskar on 23 June 2008.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{was sold}} to Middlesbrough {{in the summer of}} 1955 for £3,500 by new Coventry manager Jesse Carver, {{following}} an assessment of the playing staff by Carver and new coach George Raynor. It was at Middlesbrough that Taylor first met his future managerial partner Brian Clough, who was then fourth-choice striker at Ayresome Park. Taylor spotted Clough's potential and helped him to achieve a place in the first team. Taylor initially contacted Storer, now manager of Derby County, <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> him to sign Clough, but Storer had told him he had spent the club's budget on signing Martin McDonnell and Paddy Ryan. Manager Bob Dennison led [...] "Boro" [...] to 14th in the Second Division in 1955–56, seeing both Clough and Taylor only as [...] "useful reserves". The pair spent their spare time coaching schoolboys to boost their wages and to gain experience. Clough {{went on to become the}} club's star striker with 197 goals in 213 league games, and though Taylor would also break into the first team after replacing Rolando Ugolini, he later admitted he was only ever an [...] "average goalkeeper".|$|E

500|$|Clarkson favored [...] "Run Run Rudolph" [...] as her {{favorite}} classic, saying: [...] "Just because {{it got to}} be a little more rock and roll." [...] She also remarked that [...] "Please Come Home for Christmas (Bells Will Be Ringing)" [...] was the first song selected for inclusion after her mother's recommendation and the song's melancholic lyrics. Written by Clarkson and Eubanks, [...] "Every Christmas", was the first song to be written for the album. She revealed that the song narrates of her holiday life prior to meeting Brandon Blackstock, Reba McEntire's stepson, saying: [...] "Every Christmas, I was just like, 'This is going to be different, right? I'm going to actually find someone and not be pathetically alone for the rest of my life?'". The seventh track is a cover of Elvis Presley's [...] "Blue Christmas". Its follow-up, a rendition of [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside", features Ronnie Dunn. Clarkson had approached Dunn thinking that his personality suited the song's content well, saying: [...] "Like, it's straight-up his personality to say all of that <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> you to stay, and have a drink." [...] "Winter Dreams (Brandon's Song)" [...] was written by Clarkson, Arrison, and Eubanks as a companion piece to [...] "Every Christmas".

2500|$|In February 1895, Churchill was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant in the Fourth Hussars regiment of the British Army, based at Aldershot. This position earned him a wage of £150 a year, which was far outstripped by his expenditure. In July, he rushed to Crouch Hill, North London to sit with Everest as she lay dying, subsequently organising her funeral. Churchill was eager to witness military action and used his mother's influence <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> him posted to a warzone. In the autumn of 1895 he and Reginald Barnes travelled to Cuba to observe its war of independence; they joined Spanish troops attempting to suppress independence fighters and were caught up in several skirmishes. In North America, he also spent time in New York City, staying with the wealthy politician Bourke Cockran at the latter's Fifth Avenue residence; Cockran profoundly influenced the young Churchill. Churchill admired the United States, writing to his brother that it was [...] "a very great country" [...] and telling his mother [...] "what an extraordinary people the Americans are!" ...|$|E

After struggling to cope with Tyson's pace, Sobers managed to score a half-century, raising hope {{that he would be}} selected for the upcoming tour to England, something he considered unlikely after his lack of form. In the first trial match to help select the squad for the upcoming tour, Sobers scored a century in Trinidad. The matches also saw Sobers get his first look at West Indian cricket politics. Wes Hall and Frank Mason were competing for a single place in the touring party, and Sobers and Everton Weekes decided they [...] "would take on Mason and knock him out of the firing line <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> our fellow Bajan (countryman) Wes in the team."

2500|$|On March 12, 2012, the Diocesan Department of Communications {{announced}} that, [...] "The Diocese has {{not formally}} {{received from the}} Vatican any decrees from the Congregation of Clergy concerning parish appeals; subsequently, no response is available at this time." [...] That same day, the National Catholic Reporter wrote that Borre surmised, [...] "I received these decrees legitimately on Monday , so I find it passing strange that the bishop of a major diocese is still claiming that the check is in the mail, so to speak, but strange things happen." [...] 'In fact, {{it does not appear}} that he appreciated the fact that two separate procedures with different criteria are required. In other cases, the Congregation has been extremely demanding on reducing churches to profane use and insisting on demonstrably [...] "grave causes."' Borre said he believed that the congregation, so irritated with Lennon, purposefully highlighted his 'procedural flubs and the back-and-forth that they went through <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a nonexistent decree.' 'The language of the decree language states very clearly that we the parishioners are upheld , as a matter of procedure, and , as a matter of substantive canon law,' he said.}} ...|$|E
2500|$|Mad Men {{featured}} {{a significant number}} of products and brands that existed both in the 1960s and at the time of airing, many of them shown as advertising clients, including Lucky Strike, Bethlehem Steel, Heineken, Volkswagen, Cadillac, Playtex, Chanel, Spam, Utz potato chips, Maidenform, Gillette, American Airlines and Clearasil. This led to widespread speculation that many or all of the products and brands on the show are the result of paid product placement. In fact, nearly all real products featured were included solely for purposes of realism, with no product placement deals behind them. Showrunner Matthew Weiner said in an interview: [...] "There is very little , and it is an illusion that is propagated by the network <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> more business. It never works out... Literally I've named four [...] in four seasons and there have probably been a hundred products on the show. Half of them are made up, no one's paying to be on the show." [...] According to Weiner, the companies that did pay for product placement are Jack Daniel's, Heineken, Unilever and Hilton, though the last was only a payment of gratitude after a storyline involving Hilton had already aired.|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{would have}} liked to open {{the left side of the}} thorax to take the ribs as relics and then remove the heart which I am certain must have survived. However, as the trunk was {{slightly}} supported on the left arm, it would have been rather difficult <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> at the heart without doing too much noticeable damage. As the Mother Superior had expressed a desire for the Saint's heart to be kept together with the whole body, and as Monsignor the Bishop did not insist, I gave up the idea of opening the left-hand side of the thorax and contented myself with removing the two right ribs which were more accessible. ... What struck me during this examination, of course, was the state of perfect preservation of the skeleton, the fibrous tissues of the muscles (still supple and firm), of the ligaments, and of the skin, and above all the totally unexpected state of the liver after 46 years. One would have thought that this organ, which is basically soft and inclined to crumble, would have decomposed very rapidly or would have hardened to a chalky consistency. Yet, when it was cut it was soft and almost normal in consistency. I pointed this out to those present, remarking that this did not seem to be a natural phenomenon.".|$|E

In one article, a senior fellow at Georgetown University's Woodstock Theological Center, Fr. Thomas J.

Beal, JCD, wrote in the same article [...] "It does appear that the defects identified by the Congregation are primarily procedural," [...] and observed that, [...] "If the findings of fact in the decrees are correct, Bishop Lennon badly botched the procedure for closing/suppressing the parishes and completely ignored the separate process for reducing the two parish churches to profane use." [...] Beal also reasoned that [...] "In fact, it does not appear that he [...] appreciated the fact that two separate procedures with different criteria are required. In other cases, the Congregation has been extremely demanding on reducing churches to profane use and insisting on demonstrably 'grave causes'."
