Power distance also had effect on evaluators and users. When evaluator’s title were higher than users, evaluator would pay more attention to users’ doing, not like to give user detailed instruction, usually loose communication with user, and spent less for task management.

40|$|It {{is clear}} that the past 10 years has brough t with it a {{dramatic}} increase in the study of attitudes toward those of the Muslim faith. Although this research has examined a number of issues related to societal attitudes toward those of the Muslims, comparatively little {{attention has been paid to}} how these attitudes might impact decisions in a legal context. As such, this research employed a mock juror decision - making paradigm in order to examine how an individual's religious orientation might impact the perception of evidence. Specifically, participan <b>ts</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to read a summary of a trial transcript in which a woman was charged with murdering her husband but was claiming that the killing was a result of her suffering from Battered Spouse Syndrome. The impact of religious orientation was examined by altering the religion of the husband and wife across conditions (i. e., Catholic or Muslim). Results indicate that participant decisions regarding the acceptance of the claim of Battered Spouse Syndrome, and subsequent guilt ratings, were significantly imp acted by the religious orientation of the husband and wife. In addition, results also indicated that jurors were differentially adhering to jury instructions depending on the religious orientation of the defendant and were less likely to perceive the defen dant in a positive light if she were portrayed as Muslim, especially in the condition in which her husband was described as Catholic. The results of this study are discussed both in terms of their social psychological and legal implications...|$|R

The purposes of this study were (1) to determine to what extent current practices of Illinois high-school football coaches adhere to standard guidelines set forth by the legal court system and (2) to determine the Illinois high-school football coaches' knowledge of standard guidelines. The population for this study consisted of 553 Illinois high-school football coaches who were listed in the directory of Illinois High school Associations for the year 1997. The subjects were categorized into two groups (Divisions 1, 2, and 3 coaches, and Divisions 4, 5, and 6 coaches). The identification of the possible legal duties listed on the questionnaire proceeded in two steps: (1) six broad duties of a coach as well as 22 duties that directly pertain to the six broad duties were derived from the review of literature, and (2) a modified delphi panel was employed to expand, modify, and validate the questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of specific statements, developed by the researcher, that directly ABSTRACT corresponded to the 22 duties for coaches. The subjects <b>t</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to indicate their knowledge and current practice of each of the 60 items on the questionnaire. From a mailing of 553 questionnaires, 30. 9 % were returned and 28. 6 % were deemed usable.
