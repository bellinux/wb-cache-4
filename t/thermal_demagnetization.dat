40|$|The cooling {{rates at}} which rocks acquire thermoremanent magnetizations (TRMs), affect their {{unblocking}} temperatures in <b>thermal</b> <b>demagnetization</b> experiments; similarly the heating rates {{at which the}} <b>thermal</b> <b>demagnetization</b> experiments are done also affect the unblocking temperature. We have tested the effects of variable cooling and heating rates on the unblocking temperatures of two natural non-interacting, magnetically uniform (single-domain, SD) (titano) magnetite samples and a synthetic SD magnetoferritin sample. While previous studies have only considered unblocking temperatures for stepwise <b>thermal</b> <b>demagnetization</b> data (i. e. the room-temperature magnetization after incremental heating), in this work we derive an expression for continuous <b>thermal</b> <b>demagnetization</b> of both TRMs and viscous remanent magnetizations (VRMs) and relate the heating rate to an effective equivalent hold time of a stepwise <b>thermal</b> <b>demagnetization</b> experiment. Through our analysis we reach four main conclusions: First, the theoretical expressions for the heating/cooling rate effect do not accurately predict experimentally observed blocking temperatures. Empirically, the relation can be modified incorporating a factor that amplifies both the temperature and the heating rate dependence of the heating/cooling rate effect. Using these correction factors, Pullaiah nomograms can accurately predict blocking temperatures of both TRMs and VRMs for continuous heating/cooling. Second, demagnetization temperatures are approximately predicted by published ‘Pullaiah nomograms’, but blocking occurs gradually over temperature intervals of 5 – 40 K.

This comparison provided a mean paleomagnetic pole (85.9 °N, 236.6 °E, A 95 = 6.2 °, K = 115.9, N = 6) that we consider represents the Middle Miocene pole for northeastern Japan. It is statistically indistinguishable from coeval poles for southwestern Japan, South Korea, and northern China, and we therefore conclude that northeastern Japan {{as a whole has}} not been subjected to tectonic rotation since the Middle Miocene.

The impact of pyrrhotite alteration and metastable preservation of high-temperature superstructures upon rapid cooling is discussed.

The samples used in these experiments were approximately 1 -inch in diameter and 1 -inch in length and were oriented in the field using a sun compass. The lava flow (referred to as E 1) is 5 meters thick and the samples were drilled every half-meter through its thickness. The direction of the magnetic field immediately prior to the eruption of E 1, pointing steeply upward and NW is recorded by the underlying flow W 7. The field direction following the eruption of E 1, shallow and SE, is defined by a series of overlying lava flows all with the same paleomagnetic direction. All the lava flows formed during a polarity reversal of the geomagnetic field. The sample from nearest the flow base contains a single characteristic magnetization identical to that of the underlying flow. Seven samples from the interior of the flow contain composite magnetizations. The high temperature component (acquired first during cooling) is similar to the direction recorded by the flow base. The lower temperature components (acquired later as cooling progressed) drift closer to the direction of the overlying flow. The sample from the flow top was apparently completely remagnetized by the heat from the overlying flow. These paleomagnetic data are very similar to those gathered from Steens Mountain, Oregon.

The dating of each archaeological structure was established with archaeological or chronometric methods. Thirty-seven of these structures are dated {{from the first}} millennium BC, one {{from the end of}} the second millennium BC and the last one from the fourth millennium BC. Thermomagnetic curves, unblocking temperatures and coercivities suggest that the main carrier of the remanent magnetization is a Ti-poor titanomagnetite. Archaeodirections were obtained by alternating field and <b>thermal</b> <b>demagnetizations</b> on almost 900 specimens. The anisotropy tensor of thermoremanent magnetization was determined for 35 structures and 22 mean archaeodirections were corrected for anisotropy. The new archaeodirections are very consistent with previously published data. A new directional SVC was built using bivariate statistics with selected Western Europe data located within 1000 km of Paris. Selection criteria include the number of samples, the dating reliability and the accuracy of the mean archaeodirection. Resulting secular variation between 1500 BC and 0 AD mainly shows large changes in declination, while inclinations are bracketed between ∼ 65 ° and ∼ 75 °. The declinations show a strong maximum with values ∼ 30 - 35 ° around 800 - 750 BC, followed by a sharp decrease to values around 0 ° at 500 BC and close to − 7 ° around 250 BC. The main features of the secular variation from 1500 BC to 0 AD appear to be a dominant westward drift and two major changes around 800 and 250 BC. Compared to the global and regional geomagnetic models, the new reference data are better fitted by ARCH 3 k_cst. 1 and SCHA. DIF. 3 k than by ARCH 3 k. 1 and CALS 3 k. 4 models. The strong variation of the archaeodirection between 1000 and 500 BC makes archaeomagnetism very useful for dating purposes...|$|R
