40|$|Little {{research}} has been conducted focusing on parent training strategies aimed at teaching parents with an intellectual disability to implement strategies to decrease their child&# 039;s problem behaviour and increase appropriate behaviours. This study aimed to do two things. First, to examine the effectiveness of an enhanced assessment-based BPT intervention that was implemented by parents with an intellectual disability with children with problem behaviour. Second, the current study also aimed to test the effectiveness of the parent training package used to teach parents to implement the intervention strategies. Importantly, in an attempt to identify the training condition, or combination of conditions, most needed to achieve behaviour change, individual conditions of a multi-condition parent training package were additively introduced during parent training based on the degree of intrusiveness in the <b>target</b> <b>routine</b> combined with the amount of structure required by the teaching strategy. Five parents were taught to implement a functional assessment driven intervention plan aimed at increasing their child&# 039;s appropriate behaviour and decreasing their problem behaviour during a valued family routine. In order to establish the combination of parent training strategies that were sufficient to teach parents to effectively implement the intervention plan, a series of parent training strategies were introduced in a planned way. The strategies included role-play, verbal instruction, verbal instruction plus feedback, coaching and video-feedback. Results showed that for all parents skill acquisition did not occur until the final phase, video-feedback. Successful implementation of the intervention resulted in a corresponding increase in child appropriate behaviour and decrease in child problem behaviour. In addition to that, parents rated the social validity and contextual fit of the inte rvention highly...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the incidence of}} RhD immunisation after implementation of first trimester non-invasive fetal RHD screening to select only RhD negative women carrying RHD positive fetuses for routine antenatal anti-D prophylaxis (RAADP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We present a population-based prospective observational cohort study with historic controls including all maternity care centres and delivery hospitals in the Stockholm region, Sweden. All RhD negative pregnant women were screened for fetal RHD genotype in the first trimester of pregnancy. Anti-D immunoglobulin (250 - 300 µg) was administered intramuscularly in gestational week 28 - 30 to participants with RHD positive fetuses. Main outcome measure was the incidence of RhD immunisation developing during or after pregnancy. RESULTS: During the study period 9380 RhD negative women gave birth in Stockholm. Non-invasive fetal RHD genotyping using cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma was performed in 8374 pregnancies of which 5104 (61 %) were RHD positive and 3270 (39 %) RHD negative. In 4590 pregnancies with an RHD positive test the women received antenatal anti-D prophylaxis. The incidence of RhD immunisation in the study cohort was 0. 26 percent (24 / 9380) (95 % CI 0. 15 - 0. 36 %) compared to 0. 46 percent (86 / 18546) (95 % CI 0. 37 to 0. 56 %) in the reference cohort. The risk ratio (RR) for sensitisation was 0. 55 (95 % CI 0. 35 to 0. 87) and the risk reduction was statistically significant (p =  0. 009). The absolute risk difference was 0. 20 percent, corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 500. CONCLUSIONS: Using first trimester non-invasive antenatal screening for fetal RHD to <b>target</b> <b>routine</b> antenatal anti-D prophylaxis selectively to RhD negative women with RHD positive fetuses significantly reduces the incidence of new RhD immunisation. The risk reduction is comparable to that reported in studies evaluating the outcome of non selective RAADP to all RhD negative women.

40|$|Background: There {{is a high}} non-attendance {{rate for}} {{traditional}} clinic-based routine asthma care in general practice. Alternative methods of providing routine asthma care need to be examined. Aim: To examine the cost and effectiveness of <b>targeted</b> <b>routine</b> asthma care in general practice using telephone triage, compared to usual clinic care. Design of study: An open randomised controlled trial. Setting: A single semi-rural practice in the southwest of England. Method:: Adult patients with asthma were randomised to receive either their routine asthma care in the surgery or care by telephone triage. Asthma control parameters, health status and NHS resource utilisation were measured over the 12 -month study period. Results: One hundred and ninety-four patients were randomised and 35 % per cent more patients (n = 84 versus n = 62) received more than one consultation in the telephone group. Asthma control {{as measured by the}} asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) was similar in the clinic and telephone groups: mean change in ACQ = - 0. 11 (95 % CI = - 0. 32 to 0. 11) versus - 0. 18 (95 % CI = - 0. 38 to 0. 02). Mean NHS costs were 210 per patient per year in the telephone group compared to 2334 in the clinic group (P-value of bootstrapped difference 0. 071). Conclusion: <b>Targeted</b> <b>routine</b> asthma care by telephone triage of adult asthmatics can lead to more asthma patients being reviewed, at less cost per patient and without loss of asthma control compared to usual routine care in the surgery...|$|R

In {{order to support}} future missions, the guidance and targeting architecture for the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle {{must be able to}} operate in complete autonomy, without any support from the ground. Orion's guidance and targeting system must be sufficiently flexible to easily adapt to a wide array of undecided future missions, yet also not cause an undue computational burden on the flight computer.

40|$|Significance: Oxidized {{phospholipids}} are now well-recognized as {{markers of}} biological oxidative stress and bioactive molecules with both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects. While analytical methods {{continue to be}} developed for studies of generic lipid oxidation, mass spectrometry (MS) has underpinned the advances in knowledge of specific oxidized phospholipids by allowing their identification and characterization, and {{is responsible for the}} expansion of oxidative lipidomics. Recent Advances: Studies of oxidized phospholipids in biological samples, both from animal models and clinical samples, have been facilitated by the recent improvements in MS, especially <b>targeted</b> <b>routines</b> that depend on the fragmentation pattern of the parent molecular ion and improved resolution and mass accuracy. MS can be used to identify selectively individual compounds or groups of compounds with common features, which greatly improves the sensitivity and specificity of detection. Application of these methods have enabled important advances in understanding the mechanisms of inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis, steatohepatitis, leprosy and cystic fibrosis, and offer potential for developing biomarkers of molecular aspects of the diseases. Critical Issues and Future Directions: The future in this field will depend on development of improved MS technologies, such as ion mobility, novel enrichment methods and databases and software for data analysis, owing to the very large amount of data generated in these experiments.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of facilitating {{generalized}} use of teaching strategies by parents of children with autism within daily routines. Method: Five preschool children with autism participated in intervention with a parent within daily routines in the family’s home. Parents learned to include 2 teaching strategies in <b>target</b> <b>routines</b> to address their child’s communication objectives. Parent– child interactions in routines were videotaped for data coding and analysis. Proactive programming of generalization occurred by systematic selection of intervention routines and by embedding intervention in multiple routines. Generalization data were collected by measuring strategy use in untrained routines. A multiple baseline design across teaching strategies was used to assess experimental effects. Results: All parents demonstrated proficient use of teaching strategies and generalized their use across routines. The intervention had positive effects on child communication outcomes. All parents perceived the intervention to be beneficial. Conclusion: Results from this study add to the limited body of evidence supporting parent-implemented interventions in natural environments with young children with autism spectrum disorder. Additional research that replicates this approach with children of varying ages and disabilities and families with diverse characteristics is needed to support the generality of these findings.
