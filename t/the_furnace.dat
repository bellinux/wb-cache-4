5|$|In a {{blast furnace}} fuel (coke), ores, and flux (limestone) are {{continuously}} supplied {{through the top}} of <b>the</b> <b>furnace,</b> while a hot blast of air (sometimes with oxygen enrichment) is blown into the lower section of <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> {{through a series of}} pipes called tuyeres, so that the chemical reactions take place throughout <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> as the material falls downward. The end products are usually molten metal and slag phases tapped from the bottom, and flue gases exiting from the top of <b>the</b> <b>furnace.</b> The downward flow of the ore and flux in contact with an upflow of hot, carbon monoxide-rich combustion gases is a countercurrent exchange and chemical reaction process.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>furnace</b> {{continued}} in anemic health until the Panic of 1907. As {{a result of}} that crisis, it was idle for most of 1908 and half of 1909. It was operated in 1910 largely to use up its inventory of local ore, and went out of blast on January 23, 1911. Bellefonte Furnace had closed in December. The shutdown of the furnaces was to be temporary, but both facilities were no longer remunerative to operate, and no buyer willing to operate them could be found. Leftover pig iron and furnace slag from Nittany Furnace were shipped out over the Nittany Valley RR in 1912–1913. <b>The</b> <b>furnace</b> and railroad were put up for sale in 1914 and <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> demolished. <b>The</b> <b>furnace</b> site was later used by the Titan Metal and Manufacturing Company.|$|E
5|$|The slag melts in {{the heat}} of <b>the</b> <b>furnace.</b> In the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>furnace,</b> the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and {{apertures}} in the side of <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately. The iron, once cooled, is called pig iron, while the slag {{can be used as a}} material in road construction or to improve mineral-poor soils for agriculture.|$|E
50|$|Scrap steel loaded by {{overhead}} cranes using electromagnetic grabs fed the Siemens Martin Open hearth furnaces via charging machines tipping “coffin”-like 6 ft 18 in loading containers directly into <b>the</b> <b>furnaces.</b> <b>The</b> <b>furnaces</b> were heated by water gas and producer gas made on site fed to <b>the</b> <b>furnaces</b> by 36 in gas mains.|$|R
50|$|Flash {{smelting}} with oxygen-enriched air (the 'reaction gas') {{makes use}} of the energy contained in the concentrate to supply most of the energy required by <b>the</b> <b>furnaces.</b> <b>The</b> concentrate must be dried before it is injected into <b>the</b> <b>furnaces</b> and, in <b>the</b> case of the Outokumpu process, some of <b>the</b> <b>furnaces</b> use an optional heater to warm the reaction gas typically to 100-450 °C.|$|R
50|$|Mason {{estimated}} that <b>the</b> <b>furnaces</b> date to around 1600, {{the same period}} as <b>the</b> Melville Koppies <b>furnace.</b> Bits of slag were found near <b>the</b> <b>furnaces,</b> on large flat rocks with indentations in them that were used for grinding.|$|R
5|$|Michael Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen), {{also known}} as Bishop II, is a {{scientist}} employed by Weyland-Yutani.

Ripley does not believe him, and backs away towards <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> as he begs her {{to give him the}} creature. Aaron sneaks up behind him and strikes him with a crowbar, nearly ripping off his ear. He watches in despair as Ripley sacrifices herself by falling into the lead smelter.|$|E
5|$|Once again, Gephart {{appeared}} on the scene to save <b>the</b> <b>furnace.</b> With the backing of Philadelphia and New York investors, he formed the Nittany Iron Company, which bought and rehabilitated <b>the</b> <b>furnace,</b> returning it to blast on June 5, 1902, under Frank H. Clemson (former chief of mining at Gephart's Bellefonte Furnace Company). Other organizers included Lorenzo Terbal Munson, Gephart's brother-in-law (who was associated with Bellefonte Glass and the Bellefonte Iron and Nail Works), Archer Brown, and William Sampson. However, prosperity did not return to the ironmaking business. <b>The</b> <b>furnace</b> was idle for two months in 1904. As steel production in open hearth furnaces became increasingly commonplace (a method better suited for iron made from Lake Superior ore, while Bessemer converters functioned best with Centre County ore), Nittany Furnace found it increasingly difficult to operate at a profit. The death of Gephart on February 14, 1905 also dealt a blow to the company, which thereafter shared management with the Bellefonte Furnace Company.|$|E
5|$|The {{preliminaries}} to the furnace's construction {{began in}} 1885, when Valentine and Thomas, an old ironmaking firm of Bellefonte, {{decided to sell}} off its properties. These then consisted of Bellefonte Forge, on Logan Branch just south of Bellefonte, and Bellefonte Furnace, a cold blast charcoal iron furnace lying about a mile south of the town, also on Logan Branch, as well as holdings in local iron ore mines. Both plants were served by the Bellefonte, Nittany and Lemont Railroad, {{a subsidiary of the}} PRR. The ironworks and ore lands were bought on August 2, 1886, for $400,000, by the Valentine Ore Land Association, whose principals organized the Centre Iron Company to erect a new iron furnace on the site of Bellefonte Furnace, which was to be torn down. A $600,000 mortgage was immediately raised on the properties, to supply the purchase money and funds for rebuilding <b>the</b> <b>furnace.</b> The leaders of the company included Edmund Blanchard, W. M. Stewart, and B. K. Jamison, a Philadelphia banker. The plant was built in 1887, and the Nittany Valley Railroad was built to supply it with ore. It became necessary to raise additional funds, and in 1887, the Pennsylvania Railroad purchased $75,000 worth of bonds in exchange for exclusive rights to rail traffic to and from <b>the</b> <b>furnace.</b> The first load of ore was delivered by the Nittany Valley on February 28, 1888, and <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> went into blast on March 4, 1888. The company was originally headed by Jamison, but by 1890, James B. Coryell was president and Jamison vice-president. At this time, <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> had one 70-foot (21-meter) stack and three hot-blast stoves, with a capacity of 30,000tons (27,200tonnes) of iron per year. Ore was supplied from local hematite deposits, and <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> was fuelled by Connellsville coke. In the same year, however, the failure of Jamison's bank precipitated the closure of <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> by the sheriff on November 15, 1890. It was subsequently sold under foreclosure.|$|E
50|$|One chimney remains upslope of <b>the</b> <b>furnaces,</b> to 10 metres height. Downslope of <b>the</b> <b>furnaces</b> is a brick paved area, {{with water}} tanks and {{machinery}} footings stepping {{down the slope}} from it. Close to the creek are footings and base-logs {{that may have been}} the footings for a water pump.|$|R
5000|$|The {{incoming}} {{product was}} sorted, dried {{and stored in}} hoppers above <b>the</b> reverberatory <b>furnaces.</b> <b>The</b> site had two melting furnaces and two refining furnaces about seven feet below. Water-tube boilers were heated by <b>the</b> <b>furnace's</b> waste gas which were drawn up through a 150-foot smokestack. [...] Slag was skimmed off into steel molds on cars of an electric locomotive and the copper was then drained into <b>the</b> refining <b>furnaces.</b> <b>The</b> slag accounted for approximately 35 percent of the material they received.|$|R
50|$|By the 1850s, {{improvements}} in coal technology had produced anthracite coal, which burned hotter than bituminous coal. New furnaces burned hotter and {{were much more}} efficient, and the industry was moving west to places like Pittsburgh. As a result, many of <b>the</b> <b>furnaces</b> and forges closed. Speedwell closed in 1854; Cornwall held out until 1883. Some of <b>the</b> <b>furnaces</b> (including Cornwall and Hopewell) survived, simply because <b>the</b> <b>furnaces</b> were too massive to do anything with. Forges, on the other hand, could be completely dismantled and abandoned. As a result, there are no extant forges remaining in America.|$|R

Scully tries to escape but is overpowered by Ed, who wraps her in a bedsheet and carries her {{down to the basement}} to throw her in <b>the</b> <b>furnace.</b> At the last moment, Ed is able to overpower the impulses of the tattoo and instead thrusts his own arm into <b>the</b> <b>furnace.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Virginia, the Marcellus ore {{occasionally}} contained zinc, {{which produced}} a characteristic green flame in <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> {{as it was}} consumed, but deposited a hard mass of impure zinc oxide known as cadmia, which built up over time {{near the top of}} the flue, and had to be removed periodically to keep it unobstructed.|$|E

5|$|The second-oldest mill {{in what is}} now Columbia County {{was built}} in a gorge on Roaring Creek, near its mouth, in the 1780s. This mill was known as the Cleaver Mill. A second mill, which was similar to the first, was later {{constructed}} at the site. John Hauch constructed a furnace on the creek in 1816. It was the first furnace in the area. The first iron furnace in Montour County was built near the creek's mouth in 1839 or 1840. <b>The</b> <b>furnace</b> was known as the Roaring Creek Anthracite Water Power Furnace. It was altered in 1854. In 1856, <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> produced 2350 tons of iron from ore on Montour Ridge, despite low water. The only post office in Mayberry Township up to 1915 was built {{at the mouth of the}} creek in 1895. It was known as Howelsville, after W.B. Howell, its first postmaster.|$|E
5|$|The tuyeres {{are used}} to {{implement}} a hot blast, {{which is used to}} increase the efficiency of the blast furnace. The hot blast is directed into <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> through water-cooled copper nozzles called tuyeres near the base. The hot blast temperature can be from 900°C to 1300°C (1600°F to 2300°F) depending on the stove design and condition. The temperatures they deal with may be 2000°C to 2300°C (3600°F to 4200°F). Oil, tar, natural gas, powdered coal and oxygen can also be injected into <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> at tuyere level to combine with the coke to release additional energy and increase the percentage of reducing gases present which is necessary to increase productivity.|$|E
5|$|According to the Holy Land Handicraft Cooperative Society, the blowing {{technique}} employed is {{the same}} as was used by the ancient Phoenicians, though archaeologists and historians of glass agree that glassblowing was not common until the last few centuries BCE. Molten glass is withdrawn from a furnace on the end of an iron pipe, which is blown into as a metal tool called a kammasha is used to shape the glass. It is returned to <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> and reshaped by the same process before being detached from the pipe and placed into a cooling chamber.|$|E

5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{are currently}} rarely used in copper smelting, but modern lead smelting blast furnaces are much shorter than iron blast furnaces and are rectangular in shape. The overall shaft height is around 5 to 6 m. Modern lead blast furnaces {{are constructed using}} water-cooled steel or copper jackets for the walls, and have no refractory linings in the side walls. The base of <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> is a hearth of refractory material (bricks or castable refractory). Lead blast furnaces are often open-topped rather than having the charging bell used in iron blast furnaces.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{also note}} the {{entertaining}} {{methods used to}} drive the plot. When Atticus is out of town, Jem locks a Sunday school classmate in the church basement with <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> during a game of Shadrach. This prompts their black housekeeper Calpurnia to escort Scout and Jem to her church, which allows the children a glimpse into her personal life, as well as Tom Robinson's. Scout falls asleep during the Halloween pageant and makes a tardy entrance onstage, causing the audience to laugh uproariously. She is so distracted and embarrassed that she prefers to go home in her ham costume, which saves her life.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, 1912, the new library {{opened on}} the {{property}} near Willamette University and the Oregon State Capitol, though construction on the structure was not completed, {{and much of the}} furniture had not been installed in the building. The completed structure included hardwood floors, crown molding, windows that were two-stories tall, and a fireplace. The library cost $30,000 to build, and within a year of operating had expanded to serve nearly 7,700 patrons with a collection of nearly 10,500 books. On January 4, 1920, a small fire damaged <b>the</b> <b>furnace</b> room and about 50 books at the library.|$|E
50|$|The glassmaking {{operation}} required three furnaces {{with different}} sizes. <b>The</b> first <b>furnace</b> was for melting the glass, the smaller one for annealing or cooling the finished glass. And an even smaller fritting <b>furnace</b> for preheating <b>the</b> ingredients needed {{for making the}} glass. A fourth furnace was erected to fire up the clay pots used in the glassmaking process. The construction of <b>the</b> <b>furnaces</b> {{was made up of}} huge boulders rolled out of the river and glued together with mud. A rectangular wood-frame building was constructed to protect <b>the</b> <b>furnaces</b> and <b>the</b> workers from the weather. Overall the glass house was about thirty seven feet wide by fifty feet long, and probably had a high thatched roof and partially open sides with the office situated next to <b>the</b> <b>furnaces.</b>|$|R
