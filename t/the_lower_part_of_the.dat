Nine specimens of A. longicervia have been found, including holotype CBO0220 and paratype CBO0754.|$|E
5|$|Areas along Fishing Creek contain pools {{followed}} by riffles, which are further {{followed by}} more pools. This configuration of pools and riffles creates an ideal situation for fly-fishing. <b>The</b> <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek forms {{one side of}} a triangle of low-lying land in western Bloomsburg, which floods severely during heavy rains.|$|E

5|$|Like other bird-hipped dinosaurs of the Dinosaur Park Formation, Gryposaurus {{appears to}} have only existed {{for part of the}} {{duration}} of time that the rocks were being formed. As the formation was being laid down, it recorded a change to more marine-influenced conditions. Gryposaurus is absent from {{the upper part of the}} formation, with Prosaurolophus present instead. Other dinosaurs known from only <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> formation include the horned Centrosaurus and the hollow-crested duckbill Corythosaurus. Gryposaurus may have preferred river-related settings.|$|E
