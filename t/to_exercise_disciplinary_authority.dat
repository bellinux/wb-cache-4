40|$|Over {{the years}} Congress has made plenty {{of efforts to}} “improve” the {{military}} justice system {{for a variety of}} reasons, but few matters have generated more offerings than did the Pentagon’s report this past spring of an estimated 26, 000 victims of “unwanted sexual contacts” in the armed forces. Some initiatives to address this very critical problem, like the bipartisan effort of Senators Barbara Boxer and Lindsey Graham, look promising; others, not so much. However, none are as misguided as Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s proposal. Indeed, it is hard to think of a proposal that could be more wrong for the military, and especially for the victims of sexual assaults. Sen. Gillibrand wants to remove commanders from the military justice process and replace them with a new, 600 -person bureaucracy which would have lawyers as the “deciders” in disciplinary matters involving sexual assault and other serious cases. Her proposal is based on a popular narrative that is filled with false impressions such as the notion {{that the majority of the}} estimated 26, 000 victims are women (actually, 53 % are men); that military personnel do not “trust” their commanders (polls show they do); that the handful of foreign militaries who have removed their commanders have shown progress in combatting sexual assault (they have not); and that prosecutor-centric systems like the one Sen. Gillibrand wants to impose on the military are more successful than the military’s in suppressing sexual assault (the evidence shows they are less so). Most troubling is the fundamental lack of a real understanding in Sen. Gillibrand’s proposal as to what solves problems in the armed forces. It is axiomatic in the military that everything important is commander-led. This is particularly true with respect to the matters of morale and discipline that are so central to the warfighting capabilities for which commanders – not lawyers – are ultimately responsible and accountable. Lawyers, even those thoroughly expert in the law and indisputably well-intentioned as those serving in the armed forces, simply do not, and could not, have the broader insights and experience that commanders acquire through years of leadership, and by bearing the grave burden of sending young Americans in harms’ way to do the Nation’s business. Commanders are uniquely and irreplaceably equipped <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> <b>disciplinary</b> <b>authority</b> in what the Supreme Court recognizes as the military’s “separate society. ” This essay argues that combatting sexual assault through the military justice system is just too important to be anything other than commander-led, and offers ten reasons why Sen. Gillibrand’s proposal will hurt not only the military’s readiness and warfighting capability, but also sexual assault victims. In addition, it describes legislative initiatives that should be examined, but are not being considered by anyone in Congress...|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} Republic, {{it was the}} {{commanding}} general who <b>exercised</b> ultimate <b>disciplinary</b> and judicial <b>authority</b> within the army. Because there were no specific laws that bounded his decision-making, the general was, in essence, free to maintain discipline and administer punishment in any way he saw fit. However, in reality penalties were customary and specific acts were generally met with specific punishments. In ordinary, daily circumstances, the punishment of soldiers was left to a tribunal of military tribunes. The military tribunes tried the suspect(s) and were responsible for deciding on the appropriate punishment. For the allied auxiliary troops, punishment was administered by their prefects. The fate of higher-ranked officers was decided by the commanding general. While centuries and junior officers <b>exercised</b> <b>disciplinary</b> <b>authority</b> and thus {{were responsible for the}} maintenance of discipline of the smaller unit-scale, they were not authorized to decide on the punishment of their subordinates.|$|R

Thirty years on, this collected volume of essays by Franklin’s students and colleagues returns to that challenge and the vibrant intellectual field that has since developed. Moving freely between insights into opera, Volksoper, film, festival, and choral movement, and from the very earliest years {{of the twentieth century}} up to the 1980 s, its authors listen with a ‘critical ear’: they site these musical phenomena within a wider web of modern cultural practices - a perspective, in turn, that enables them <b>to</b> <b>exercise</b> a <b>disciplinary</b> self-awareness after Franklin’s manner...|$|R

40|$|Museums are powerful. Museums can {{discipline}} {{the mindset}} of people.

This paper is to look into the ways how museums discipline the mindset of people. The research methodology used for this study is purely qualitative. The validity of this paper lays in those primary data collected through personal communication with administrators of museums, and is supported by secondary data from books. The findings are that museums can discipline the mindset of people to make them believe in a hierarchy of social and world order, to scope their understanding of their relationship with the world and to instruct and to edify them. Based on a situation that people in general consider museums are reliable sources, this paper raises the concern of the neutrality of museums as disseminators of knowledge and facilitators of making people understand themselves and their relationship with their surrounding at large...|$|R

40|$|In {{a recent}} {{critique}} of early US cost accounting practice, Hoskin and Macve (1996) conclude that Lawrence Manufacturing Company's 1848 cost accounting reports were purely mercantile and provided no managerial utility. Despite finding mathematically exact allocations and unit costs for different cloth grades and production locations, Hoskin and Macve argue that mill accounting was neither modern nor managerial, descriptors they limit <b>to</b> the <b>exercise</b> of <b>disciplinary</b> control over labour through standard costs and variances. They conclude that scholars have overstated the managerial utility of cost accounting {{during the first}} half of the nineteenth century. In rebuttal, this paper garners archival evidence to show that cost accounting was used by early nineteenth-century US textile owner/managers in a variety of decision-making, management control and problem-solving scenarios. Specific attention was directed to evidence in forms other than accounting ledgers and summary statements, i. e. letters, memoranda, cost reports, etc., which might reveal if and how accounting was used to address issues such as make-or-buy, product pricing, wage setting, site selection and asset expansion and acquisition. While the absence of standard costs and variances affirms Hoskin and Macve's narrow interpretation of managerialism, evidence presented refutes their wider, more substantive claim that cost accounting served only mercantile purposes at the US mills.

40|$|As Southeast Asia 2 ̆ 7 s {{most populous}} and most dense {{metropolitan}} conurbation, {{and the second}} largest urban footprint in the world, Jakarta, Indonesia, is already a city of postnatural hypercomplexity. However, recent trends in weather intensification, sea level rise, extreme river pollution, river flooding, and coastal inundation have made the city {{one of the key}} sites of research for urban theorists seeking to understand the pressures and politics of megacity transformation in the 21 st century. Among the theorists engaged in such forms of inquiry, Professor AbdouMaliq Simone of the Hawke Research Institute, University of South Australia, has developed one of the most robust and influential theories of 2 ̆ 2 cityness 2 ̆ 2 through his recent publications, especially in his monograph City Life from Jakarta to Dakar: Movements at a Crossroads (New York and London: Routledge, 2011). In his lecture, Just the City: Rethinking the Image of Urban Poverty, Professor Simone will present research from his ongoing projects in Jakarta, Southeast Asia, and Africa, where his work is committed to rethinking the image of urban poverty, the politics of informality, and the struggles for social emancipation within megacities of the global south. This event coincides with the release of Jakarta: Architecture + Adaptation, edited by Etienne Turpin, Adam Bobbette, and Meredith Miller (Depok: Universitas Indonesia Press, 2013). Given Professor AbdouMaliq Simone 2 ̆ 7 s central role in the theoretical approach guiding the book, not to mention his formative interview which appears in the book, it is especially fitting that he would give this lecture and participate in a discussion on the politics and paradoxes of urban poverty for to coincide with the release of the publication in Australia.
