He said he was unhappy with the academy's unwillingness to invest more in its football program. [...] "This is a desperate situation", he said {{near the end of the}} 1979 season. [...] "To fight alone as a football staff is impossible." [...] He resigned in July 1980 after leading Army to a 2–8–1 record the previous season.|$|E

2500|$|Lane {{was born}} in Austin, Texas, in April 1928. [...] When he was three months old, he was {{abandoned}} by his birth parents, a prostitute and pimp. He was found, covered in newspapers, in a dumpster. Lane later recalled, [...] "My father was called Texas Slim. I never saw him - I don't know if he's the one that told my mother to throw me away. A pimp told my mother I had to go. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> in a trash can and took off. Some people heard me crying. They {{thought it was a}} cat." ...|$|E
2500|$|I was at {{the post}} office with my Mum and Auntie [...] They put us in the police ute and said they were taking us to Broome. They put the mums in there as well. But when we'd gone [...] they stopped, and threw the mothers out of the car. We jumped on our mothers' backs, crying, trying not to be left behind. But the policemen pulled us off and threw us back in the car. They pushed the mothers away and drove off, while our mothers were chasing the car, running and crying after us. We were {{screaming}} in the back of that car. When we got to Broome <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> and my cousin in the Broome lock-up. We were only ten years old. We were in the lock-up for two days waiting for the boat to Perth.|$|E

2500|$|According to Lev Anninsky, Pisemsky's {{personal}} mythology [...] "revolved {{around one}} word: fear." [...] Biographers reproduced numerous anecdotes {{about him being}} scared of sailing and other things, {{and how he was}} often 'stuck on the front porch of his house, uncertain whether he should enter: thinking that robbers were there, or somebody had died, or a fire had started'. Quite striking were his extraordinary collection of phobias and fears, along with general hypochondria." [...] In an 1880 letter to photographer Konstantin Shapiro who had recently published his gallery of Russian writers he confessed: [...] "My portrait repeats the one flaw which all of my photographic portraits have, my not knowing how to pose. In all of my photographs my eyes come out goggled and frightened and even somewhat mad, maybe because as <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> facing the camera obscura, I do experience – if not fear, then strong anxiety." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dany Roth of blastr.com was {{impressed}} by the show's costume designs, stating that they are [...] "possibly the best on TV right now. Each costume {{tells the story of the}} world, of the people, of the specific character." [...] He said that, like Mad Max, The 100 [...] "understands that the Grounders are repurposing tools and clothing from a time long dead. But the costumes are far from uniform. The people who lived on the ark, the people who live in the forest, the people who live in a frozen tundra, they all dress differently.", and although [...] "there's fashion here that makes the clothes exciting", it is the clothes that tell the story. [...] "I've said this many times before and I'll say it again here," [...] he added, [...] "a good costume makes a good actor a great one. Costumes make a show's world real." [...] Maureen Ryan of Variety, formerly of The Huffington Post, stated that the [...] "most enduring image of Lexa is one of her sitting on a throne made of intertwined branches, her enigmatic eyes looking out from a face half-covered in elaborate war paint." [...] Debnam-Carey said, [...] "I'm lucky <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> in such a badass costume and makeup. It's funny, we did a whole day of tests with that makeup. We were like, 'Should we do this? Should we do tears? Should we do the bindi?'" [...] She collaborated with Rothenberg on the makeup and wardrobe for her character, and both collaborated with viewers on fan versions of the designs.|$|E
2500|$|Adams {{initially}} {{may have}} met James Dean in December 1950 while jitterbugging for a soft drink commercial filmed at Griffith Park. Adams {{spent three years}} in the Coast Guard between the time this commercial was shot in late 1950 and the start of filming for Rebel Without a Cause in March 1955. Actor Jack Grinnage, who played Moose, recalled, [...] "Off the set, Nick, Dennis (Hopper), and the others would go out together--almost like the gang we portrayed--but Jimmy and Corey Allen... were not a part of that." [...] They became friends during filming. During breaks, Dean and Adams entertained cast and crew with impersonations of Marlon Brando and Elia Kazan (who had directed Dean in East of Eden). A 1955 Warner Brothers press release quoted Dean as saying, [...] "I shall be busy for the rest of 1955, and Nick will be doing film work for the next six months. Come 1956, however, I wouldn't be surprised to find myself with Adams doing a two-a-night nightclub routine--or acting in a comedy by William Shakespeare." [...] When production was wrapped, Dean said in another press release, [...] "I now regard Natalie (Wood), Nick, and Sal (Mineo) as co-workers; I regard them as friends... about the only friends I have in this town. And I hope we all work together again soon." [...] Following Dean's 1955 death in an automobile accident, Adams overdubbed some of Dean's lines for the film Giant (these are in Jett Rink's speech at the hotel) and dated co-star Natalie Wood. Adams tried to capitalize on Dean's fame through various publicity stunts, including a claim he was being stalked by a crazed female Dean fan, allowing himself to be photographed at Dean's grave in a contemplative pose, holding flowers, and surrounded by mourning, teenaged female fans along with writing articles and doing interviews about Dean for fan magazines. He also claimed to have developed Dean's affection for fast cars, later telling a reporter, [...] "I became a highway delinquent. I was arrested nine times in one year. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> on probation, but I kept on racing... nowhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Lewisham {{a little}} reluctantly. [...] "Yes. A hundred {{a year or}} so. That's the sort of idea. And there's lots of places beyond South Kensington, of course, even if <b>they</b> don't <b>put</b> <b>me</b> up there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These private {{committees}} in a merry meeting," [...] said Wildrake, [...] "are a solecism in breeding. <b>They</b> always <b>put</b> <b>me</b> {{in mind of}} the cursed committees at Westminster.--But shall we roost before we rouse the night-owl with a catch?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} much {{matter what they}} would say," [...] he answered, still keeping his teeth {{together}} as if doubtful of their courage. [...] "As for what they would do, that is certain; <b>they</b> would <b>put</b> <b>me</b> out of my church." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} is true, and it proves what a free country this is--does it not?

6000|$|... "Psha;--promised! If <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> in a witness-box {{of course}} I must tell. When {{you come to}} this kind of work, {{promises}} don't go for much. I don't know that they ever do. What is a broken promise?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Few {{would believe}} our story; {{and those that}} did would wonder at me,--not love me as you do. <b>They</b> would <b>put</b> <b>me</b> in a cage, and make a show of me; and I should be so miserable I should die. So don't tell who I am, will you?" [...] said Lorelei earnestly.|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked about}} her situation, Mağden replied, [...] "It's {{shocking}} that <b>they</b> are <b>putting</b> <b>me</b> on trial. I've no idea what will happen.
