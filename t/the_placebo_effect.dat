40|$|Research {{shows that}} placebo {{analgesia}} and nocebo hyperalgesia can be induced through observational learning. Our {{aim was to}} replicate and extend these results by studying {{the influence of the}} type and colour of stimuli used as <b>placebos</b> on <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> induced by observational learning. Three experimental and two control groups were tested. All participants received pain stimuli of the same intensity preceded by colour lights (green and red) or geometric shapes (circles and squares). Before receiving pain stimuli, participants in the experimental groups, but not in the control groups, observed a model who rated pain stimuli that were preceded by either green lights (green placebo group), red lights (red placebo group), or circles (circle placebo group) as being less painful than those preceded by either red lights (green placebo group), green lights (red placebo group), or squares (circle placebo group). As a result participants in the experimental groups rated pain stimuli preceded by either green lights (green placebo group), red lights (red placebo group), or circles (circle placebo group) as being less painful than the participants in the control groups did, indicating that <b>placebo</b> <b>effect</b> was induced. No statistically significant differences were found in the magnitudes of <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> between <b>the</b> three experimental groups (green placebo, red placebo, and circle placebo groups), indicating that neither the type nor <b>the</b> colour of <b>placebo</b> stimuli affected <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> induced by observational learning. <b>The</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> induced by observational learning were found to be unrelated to the individual differences in pain anxiety, fear of pain, and empathy...|$|R

25|$|Motivation may {{contribute}} to <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effect.</b> The active goals of an individual changes their somatic experience by altering the detection and interpretation of expectation-congruent symptoms, and by changing the behavioral strategies a person pursues. Motivation may link to the meaning through which people experience illness and treatment. Such meaning {{is derived from the}} culture in which they live and which informs them about the nature of illness and how it responds to treatment. Research into the placebo treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers shows that this varies widely with society. <b>The</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effect</b> in treating gastric ulcers is low in Brazil, higher in northern Europe (Denmark, Netherlands), and extremely high in Germany. However, <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effect</b> in treating hypertension is lower in Germany than elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>placebo</b> is {{much more}} than a control {{medicine}} in a clinical trial. <b>The</b> <b>placebo</b> response is <b>the</b> largest component of any allergy treatment and consists of two components: nonspecific effects (eg, natural recovery) and a “true placebo effect” that is the psychological therapeutic effect of the treatment. Belief in the beneficial nature of the treatment is a key component of <b>the</b> true <b>placebo</b> <b>effect,</b> and can be enhanced by factors such as interaction with the physician and the sensory impact of the treatment. Negative beliefs can generate a nocebo effect that may explain some psychogenic illnesses; this is the basis of much research in psychoneuroimmunology. An understanding of <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> and nocebo <b>effects</b> is important for general allergy practice, and harnessing the power of <b>the</b> true <b>placebo</b> <b>effect</b> is a major challenge to modern medicine...|$|R

50|$|Some {{people and}} {{cultures}} in Asia believe that tiger penis soup {{acts as a}} medicinal aphrodisiac, can improve one's sexual performance or virility, or cure impotence. However, consumption of cooked animal genitalia does not increase testosterone levels in humans. Furthermore, there is no empirical evidence of tiger penis being correlated with sexual enhancement in humans. It has been stated that men may be fooled into thinking their sexual prowess is increased by consuming tiger penis soup due to <b>placebo</b> <b>effects,</b> in which <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> act to counteract mild impotency, rather than the soup.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effect</b> occurs more {{strongly}} in some conditions than others. Dylan Evans {{has suggested that}} placebos work most strongly upon conditions such as pain, swelling, stomach ulcers, depression, and anxiety that have been linked with activation of the acute-phase response.|$|E
25|$|Many people remain sceptical about Lourdes and its {{supposed}} healing power, {{arguing that}} any improvement {{offered by the}} shrine {{is no more than}} <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effect,</b> and that the ceremonies and processions are no better than faith-healing on a grand scale.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{trials are}} often double-blinded {{so that the}} {{researchers}} also do not know which test subjects are receiving the active or placebo treatment. <b>The</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effect</b> in such clinical trials is weaker than in normal therapy since the subjects are not sure whether the treatment they are receiving is active.|$|E
30|$|Even though <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> of <b>the</b> {{baseline}} specification in Table 3 {{fall short}} of statistical significance, they may point at a divergence of trends between the treatment and the control group. As parallel trends are a crucial assumption for difference-in-differences estimation, we devote this subsection to the inspection of group-specific trends, and we apply estimation strategies that have been proposed in the literature {{to deal with the}} divergence of trends in difference-in-differences estimation.|$|R
30|$|However, {{it would}} be {{sensible}} to suspect that these results may have been driven by chance. Indeed, {{it is possible that}} the divergences may have occurred because of the inability of the synthetic control method to reproduce the counterfactual fertility paths for Miami in the post-treatment period. If this is true, then the treatment effect estimates would be misleading. In order to test if the estimates are statistically significant, a series of placebo tests are performed. This involves applying the synthetic control method to each of the 26 metropolitan areas in the donor pool (i.e. metropolitan areas which were unaffected by the Mariel Boatlift in 1980) to see if <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> generated for 1983 and 1986 for each metropolitan area are as large as the one obtained for Miami. In effect, what we want to know is whether we would see a negative fertility effect in 1983 and 1986 that is as large as the one seen for Miami if we happen to pick at random another metropolitan area for the study rather than Miami. If <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> studies yield <b>placebo</b> treatment <b>effects</b> that are as large as the ones estimated for Miami, then this indicates that the analysis fails to provide sufficient evidence for the Mariel Boatlift having a temporary negative effect on fertility in Miami during these 2  years. On the other hand, if <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> studies show that the treatment effects for Miami are unusually large relative to <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> treatment <b>effects</b> estimated for the other metropolitan areas, then we can be more confident that the estimated treatment effects for Miami are not simply artefacts of chance, but that they instead represent genuine fertility impacts occurring in Miami during these periods, possibly driven by the Boatlift. Essentially, <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> studies allow one to compare the magnitude of the treatment effects for Miami vis-a-vis <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> for <b>the</b> unaffected metropolitan areas and thereby determine if the treatment effects for Miami are large and rare enough so that one can be confident about rejecting a hypothesis of null treatment effects.|$|R
40|$|For many subjectively {{experienced}} outcomes, such as {{pain and}} depression, rather large <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> have been reported. However, {{there is increasing}} evidence that placebo interventions also affect end-organ functions regulated by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). After discussing three psychological models for autonomic <b>placebo</b> <b>effects,</b> this article provides an anatomical framework of the autonomic system and then critically reviews <b>the</b> relevant <b>placebo</b> studies in <b>the</b> field, thereby focusing on gastrointestinal, cardiovascular and pulmonary functions. The findings indicate that several autonomic organ functions can indeed be altered by verbal suggestions delivered during placebo and nocebo interventions. In addition, three experimental studies provide evidence for organ-specific effects, {{in agreement with the}} current knowledge on the central control of the ANS. It is suggested that <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> on autonomic organ functions are best explained by the model of ‘implicit affordance’, which assumes that <b>placebo</b> <b>effects</b> are dependent on ‘lived experience’ rather than on the conscious representation of expected outcomes. Nevertheless, more studies will be needed to further elucidate psychological and neurobiological pathways involved in autonomic <b>placebo</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{primary use}} of {{dextromethorphan}} is as a cough suppressant, for the temporary relief of cough caused by minor throat and bronchial irritation (such as commonly accompanies the flu and common cold), {{as well as}} those resulting from inhaled particle irritants. However, controlled studies have found the symptomatic effectiveness of dextromethorphan similar to placebo.

25|$|Nearly all studies {{conducted}} find benefit {{in the placebo}} group. For example, Khan published a meta-analysis of studies of investigational antidepressants and found a 30% reduction in suicide and attempted suicide in the placebo groups and a 40% reduction in the treated groups. However, studies generally do not include an untreated group, so determining the actual size of <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effect,</b> compared to totally untreated patients, is difficult.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the placebo group is to account for <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effect,</b> that is, effects from {{treatment}} that do {{not depend on the}} treatment itself. Such factors include knowing one is receiving a treatment, attention from health care professionals, and the expectations of a treatment's effectiveness by those running the research study. Without a placebo group to compare against, {{it is not possible to}} know whether the treatment itself had any effect.|$|E

25|$|Another {{meta-analysis}} {{found that}} 79% of depressed patients receiving placebo remained well (for 12 weeks {{after an initial}} 6–8 weeks of successful therapy) compared to 93% of those receiving antidepressants.

40|$|Our {{previous}} {{study showed that}} placebo expectations can develop in a transferable manner; for example, a placebo expectation developed within an analgesic experience may lead to reduced anxiety.

25|$|Though <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effect</b> is {{typically}} associated with deception in order to invoke positive expectations, studies carried out by Harvard Medical School have suggested that placebos can work even without deception.

25|$|A study {{published}} in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) demonstrated that the magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effect</b> in clinical trials of depression have been growing over time, while the effect size of tested drugs has remained relatively constant. The authors suggest that one possible explanation for the growing placebo effect in clinical trials is the inclusion of larger number of participants with shorter term, mild, or spontaneously remitting depression as a result of decreasing stigma associated with antidepressant use. Placebo response rates in clinical trials of complementary and alternative (CAM) therapies are significantly lower than those in clinical trials of traditional antidepressants.|$|E
25|$|Homeopathy is {{a system}} of {{alternative}} medicine created in 1796 by Samuel Hahnemann, based on his doctrine of like cures like (similia similibus curentur), a claim that a substance that causes the symptoms of a disease in healthy people would cure similar symptoms in sick people. Homeopathy is a pseudoscience – a belief that is incorrectly presented as scientific. Homeopathic preparations are not effective for treating any condition; large-scale studies have found homeopathy {{to be no more}} effective than a placebo, indicating that any positive effects that follow treatment are only due to <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> <b>effect,</b> normal recovery from illness, or regression toward the mean.|$|E
40|$|Placebo {{is defined}} as a {{substance}} or method that has no specific effect on the condition being treated. <b>Placebo</b> leads to <b>the</b> state of contentment and shows its effects just like a drug by the pathways in the body.
