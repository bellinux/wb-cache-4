5|$|In 1962, {{the trust}} {{successfully}} lobbied {{for the house}} to become a national historic landmark. In 1972, the Trust donated the property to the National Park Service and it became the Longfellow National Historic Site {{and open to the}} public as a house museum. On display are many of the original nineteenth century furnishings, artwork, over 10,000 books owned by Longfellow, and <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>table</b> around which many important visitors gathered. Everything on display was owned by the Longfellow family. The site was renamed to Longfellow House–Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site on December 22, 2010, to ensure that the connection to Washington was not lost in the memory of the general public.|$|E

5|$|The second chorus has {{the girls}} {{dancing on the}} table, {{knocking}} several pieces of food and tuppleware onto the ground. A-Chan is seen lying down on a pillow, whilst Kashiyuka balances a book and an apple on her head. Both of these scenes have them throwing several pieces of food onto the table. Nocchi is seen at <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>table,</b> holding a fork and listen to music through her headphones. She witnesses a small door underneath a stool, opens it, and sees a small green room. In the room, a blurred image of a cup starts to become clear, and holds small candy. As the girls eat the pieces of candy, their cream-coloured dresses turn into the outfits from the cover sleeve from the single. The girls start dancing in the fish bowl, surrounded by glittery lights. The final scene has the girls looking through the small door again, only to witness {{the dining room table}} empty; the small cup with candy appears in beige colouring rather than full-on vibrancy.|$|E

25|$|As {{the formal}} {{home of the}} Russian Tsars, the palace was the setting for profuse, {{frequent}} and lavish entertaining. <b>The</b> <b>dining</b> <b>table</b> could seat 1000 guests, while the state rooms could contain up to 10,000 people—all standing, as no chairs were provided. These rooms, halls and galleries were heated to such a temperature that while it was sub-zero outside, exotic plants bloomed within, while the brilliant lighting gave the ambiance of a summer's day.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{ascension}} to the throne, Louis XVI presented the Petit Trianon to Marie Antoinette. Immediately thereafter, the queen ordered modificationlargely {{under the direction}} of Richard Miqueto the Petit Trianon and its gardens. The house was remodeled, which necessitated the removal of the dumbwaiter system that Louis XV installed that allowed <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>table</b> to be lowered to the kitchen level of the house, thus eliminating the need for servants in the dining room. At this time, the jardins botaniques were removed to Paris and the Hameau de la reine constructed in their stead.|$|E
25|$|During the Cuban {{missile crisis}} in 1962, the {{families}} of military personnel were evacuated from the base.

Dependents traveled to the airfield for flights to the United States, or to ports for passage aboard evacuation ships.

25|$|A deep fluted {{bowl with}} two small swing handles (which were {{detached}} {{at the time}} of discovery, because solder tends to loosen during burial) is of a type found in several late Roman silver hoards, such as those in the Esquiline Treasure from Rome, and from Traprain Law in Scotland. The type is thought to have developed from earlier shell-shaped bowls, and to have been used to contain water at <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>table,</b> intended for rinsing diners' hands. The chased geometric design in the centre of the Mildenhall fluted bowl depicts a six-pointed star, a device that had no specific symbolic meaning in the Roman period, but was simply one of many popular geometric figures.|$|E
25|$|More {{pictures}} were {{released to the}} press later in the day. These depicted {{the exterior of the}} Diary Room, this year a chaotic web of sliced and angled mirrors giving housemates a distorted reflection {{of the rest of the}} house. These pictures also showed that the house was composed of one main, column-free, airy room with cream-coloured carpeting on which <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>table</b> rested and an elevated kitchen containing a row of yellow cabinets. For the first time, an American-style refrigerator was utilised, giving the housemates more space for food and located next to the store-room. However, the glass wall that allowed housemates to view the bedroom from the living area was disguised as a mirror to ensure that viewers would not be able to count how many housemates would be in the House. Finally, only a few days before launch night, pictures of a loft in the garden leaked to the press. On Day 1, it was shown that it was painted green rather than the pink shown in the pictures.|$|E

500|$|State banquets {{also take}} place in the Ballroom; these formal dinners are held on the first evening of a state visit by a foreign head of state. On these occasions, for up to 170 guests in formal [...] "white tie and decorations", {{including}} tiaras, <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>table</b> is laid with the Grand Service, a collection of silver-gilt plate made in 1811 for the Prince of Wales, later GeorgeIV. The largest and most formal reception at Buckingham Palace takes place every November when the Queen entertains members of the diplomatic corps. On this grand occasion, all the state rooms are in use, as the royal family proceed through them, beginning at the great north doors of the Picture Gallery. As Nash had envisaged, all the large, double-mirrored doors stand open, reflecting the numerous crystal chandeliers and sconces, creating a deliberate optical illusion of space and light.|$|E
500|$|Once {{principal}} photography was finished, Forman {{found himself}} with miles of raw material, {{so he and}} his editor, Miroslav Hájek, spent many long hours organizing the footage {{into a series of}} situations, like the [...] "big dance" [...] situation and the [...] "meeting the parents" [...] situation. In turn, each of these situations are constructed out of sequences of gags in which the characters improvise, in the words of commentator Constantin Parvulescu, [...] "like various instruments of a band": [...] "Many of these situations can be broken down into gags. There are several such gags reminiscent of early comedy in Loves of a Blonde: the soldiers-getting-off-the-train gag; the wine-bottle gag; the wedding-ring gag; the palm-reading gag; the roll-up-blinds gag; and the three-guys-in-two-beds gag." [...] Interspersed with these gags are extended character improvisations, such as Milda's discussion of Picasso, his mother's rants at <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>table,</b> and the factory supervisor's appeal for the army's support.|$|E
500|$|A {{parody of}} da Vinci's The Last Supper, {{the picture was}} taken by Hollywood glamour {{photographer}} Ken Marcus.

Allison finds evidence of Harrison's antipathy towards organised religion in this inner-gatefold photo, following on from the lyrics to his 1970 song [...] "Awaiting on You All". In order to add to Harrison's [...] "mystique", author Bruce Spizer writes, Wilkes placed a colour image of him over the main, black-and-white print. The same detail echoed the contrast in [...] "Living in the Material World" [...] between the illusory nature of human existence and what Allison describes as the [...] "vital, eternal reality" [...] offered by spiritual enlightenment.|$|E

500|$|By the mid-1980s, ATV Music Publishing and Pye Records {{were both}} up for sale. The {{companies}} were bought relatively cheaply by Australian businessman Robert Holmes à Court, who acquired Associated Communications Corporation (the parent company) in 1982, asset-stripped the subsidiaries, and sacked many long serving employees before selling the companies on again. During this time, American singer Michael Jackson was recording [...] "Say Say Say" [...] for Paul McCartney's Pipes of Peace album.

One evening whilst at <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>table,</b> McCartney brought out a thick, bound notebook displaying all the songs to which he owned the publishing rights.

500|$|The Great Dining Room is {{situated}} in the east wing extension {{of the house and}} was added in 1877 under J. MacVicar Anderson {{during the time of the}} Red Earl. The room was inspired by the ballroom of Buckingham Palace, with walls hung with faded, red damask silk. The Spencers ate their regular meals in the Tapestry Dining Room, an inner room of the east side to the east of the Wooton Hall. Aside from the two fine vividly constructed tapestries, one of gypsies and one of farming, the room is fairly bleak in design compared to other rooms in the house; <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>table</b> is relatively small, with a drab grey floor and open brick fireplace dated in large letters to 1683. The [...] "sombre" [...] oak panelling originally came from the family's other property of Wormleighton Manor in Warwickshire.

5000|$|The Burghley Nef is a silver-gilt salt cellar made in Paris in 1527-28 (or {{possibly}} earlier). In medieval France {{the word}} nef {{was applied to}} various types of boat-shaped containers, including the most magnificent objects intended for <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> <b>tables</b> and buffets of the rich. Apart from having an obvious ornamental quality, their function was to hold personal pieces of cutlery or, as in this case, salt or spices—there is a detachable compartment on the rear deck, which was presumably passed around the table.
