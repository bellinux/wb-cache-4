25|$|We want {{every man}} and woman in these two {{counties}} to recall the dates of these murders and also to recall whether or not any person close to them was missing or out of pocket during those nights. Persons who have such information and have been withholding it when they know they should report it are leaving themselves open to possible charges of complicity in event the slayer is captured. Make no mistake {{about the fact that}} the slayer will be captured because we will not give up this hunt until he has been captured or killed. All information received will be treated confidentially. We urge you to come in and tell what you know. Don't be hesitant or fear that you are causing an innocent man embarrassment and trouble in as much all investigation will be confidential. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> take any chance on information which might lead us to the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We believe that we are justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder. Bear in mind--this killer may strike at any one. He may strike at persons close to him. For that reason, we believe any person with information that may lead us to the murderer should act in the interest of self-preservation.|$|E

'Yes, {{in things}} human, but in things Divine {{it is the}} subtle English form of rationalism. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> explain, Phoebe; but human sense and intellect are made the test, and what surpasses them is only admired as long as its {{stringent}} rules do not fetter the practice.' ...|$|E
