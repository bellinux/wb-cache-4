40|$|Existing {{methods for}} single {{document}} keyphrase extraction usually {{make use of}} only <b>the</b> <b>information</b> contained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> specified document. This paper proposes to use {{a small number of}} nearest neighbor documents to provide more knowledge to improve single document keyphrase extraction. A specified document is expanded to a small document set by adding a few neighbor documents close to the document, and the graph-based ranking algorithm is then applied on the expanded document set to make use of both <b>the</b> local <b>information</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> specified document and <b>the</b> global <b>information</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> neighbor documents. Experimental results demonstrate the good effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach...|$|R

5|$|Finally, within 36 {{hours of}} a game's {{conclusion}} (including {{the conclusion of a}} suspended game), the official scorer is required to create a summary of the game using a form established by the league. This task is performed for each game that is scored, including called games which must be completely replayed at a later date, and games that end in forfeit. <b>The</b> <b>information</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> score report includes the date, location of the game, the names of the teams, the names of the umpires who officiated the game, the final score, and the data that is required in rule 10.02.|$|E
5|$|Granule cells receive all {{of their}} input from mossy fibers, but outnumber them by 200 to 1 (in humans). Thus, <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> granule cell {{population}} activity state {{is the same as}} <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mossy fibers, but recoded in a much more expansive way. Because granule cells are so small and so densely packed, it is difficult to record their spike activity in behaving animals, so there is little data to use as a basis for theorizing. The most popular concept of their function was proposed in 1969 by David Marr, who suggested that they could encode combinations of mossy fiber inputs. The idea is that with each granule cell receiving input from only 4–5 mossy fibers, a granule cell would not respond if only a single one of its inputs were active, but would respond if more than one were active. This combinatorial coding scheme would potentially allow the cerebellum to make much finer distinctions between input patterns than the mossy fibers alone would permit.|$|E

When giving lectures on the cave dwellers, he would compare them to Eskimos, drawing parallels in their art and hunting styles, and would show pictures of the tools used by the cave dwellers that he discovered in Wookey Hole Caves, as well as items such as brooches and child's play toys. He also told of a goat-herd he discovered in a cave who had died, leaving his goats tethered, subsequently perishing.|$|E

5|$|In a DNA double helix, {{each type}} of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called {{complementary}} base pairing. Here, purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two hydrogen bonds form between guanine and cytosine. As hydrogen bonds are not covalent, they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high temperature. As {{a result of this}} base pair complementarity, all <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.|$|E

30|$|Compared {{with the}} {{previous}} works, our proposed method has various differences and advantages. Firstly, frequency-division-multiplexing (FDM) is utilized to generate the proposed single-shot pattern. So the fringe pattern and the period-code pattern {{do not have to}} be projected sequentially. <b>The</b> period-code <b>information</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proposed single-shot pattern can benefit the phase unwrapping. Because of the property of FDM, <b>the</b> phase <b>information</b> and <b>the</b> period <b>information</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> acquired image can be extracted independently.|$|R
