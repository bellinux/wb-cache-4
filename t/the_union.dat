5|$|After {{resting on}} their arms through the night, the 21st awoke to light {{fighting}} in their front. Over {{the course of}} the morning, Union forces gradually shifted to the left, including the 21st, and it became apparent that <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> right flank had collapsed. Meanwhile, Lee's forces had joined Jackson's and were pressing <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> left flank with a massive and rapid assault. Pope's entire army was soon in retreat. Ferrero's brigade was moved by Brig. Gen. Reno to a position on Henry House Hill to cover <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> retreat along the Centreville Turnpike. The brigade, with the 21st in the center, successfully held off Confederate advances from 7 to , buying critical time for <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> army. Finally, under the cover of darkness, the brigade quietly retired across Bull Run. During this defeat for <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> army, the 21st suffered light casualties of seven wounded, or two percent.|$|E

50|$|In the mid-1980s, most of {{the labor}} force was {{organized}} and was represented, at least in theory, by <b>unions.</b> <b>The</b> party controlled <b>the</b> <b>unions,</b> and a major task of <b>the</b> <b>unions</b> was to motivate workers to work harder and fulfill the plan goals. <b>The</b> <b>unions</b> served as vehicles for disseminating desired views among the workers.

50|$|In 1954 {{an eighth}} Pacific League team was founded, <b>the</b> Takahashi <b>Unions,</b> to {{increase}} <b>the</b> number of teams to eight.

5|$|On {{the second}} day of battle, most of both armies had assembled. <b>The</b> <b>Union</b> line was laid out in a {{defensive}} formation resembling a fishhook. In the late afternoon of July 2, Lee launched a heavy assault on <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> left flank, and fierce fighting raged at Little Round Top, the Wheatfield, Devil's Den, and the Peach Orchard. On <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> right, Confederate demonstrations escalated into full-scale assaults on Culp's Hill and Cemetery Hill.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Union</b> force {{suffered}} significant losses. <b>The</b> <b>Union</b> commander, Colonel Toland, was killed. The severely wounded cavalry commander, Colonel William H. Powell, {{was left}} to die and became a prisoner of the Confederates. (Powell was also second {{in command of the}} entire brigade.) Additional officers and enlisted men were killed, wounded, or missing. <b>The</b> <b>Union</b> after action report listed a total of 86 men killed, wounded, missing, or taken prisoner during the entire expedition—although Confederate leadership believed <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> casualties were much higher. (The entire expedition includes the trips to and from Wytheville.) Approximately 300 horses were lost (killed, wounded, or injured) by the brigade during the raid and retreat—including an estimated 80 killed on the streets of Wytheville. Despite significant losses, <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> brigade was eventually able to secure the town. However, the victory was costly, and the northerners retreated less than 24 hours after entering the small community. A group of soldiers and civilians, less than one third the size of <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> force they opposed, prevented a brigade from destroying vital assets of the Confederacy—a railroad line, telegraph line along the railroad, a lead mine, and possibly a salt mine. After the conflict, Union infantry leaders were critical of <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> cavalry's performance, and men from the cavalry were critical of the infantry leadership's tactics.|$|E

In 1925, discussion rose about creating a new flag for South Africa as many descendants of Boers found <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> Jack unacceptable after the Boer War. In 1926 the Balfour Declaration granted South Africa legislative autonomy, opening the possibility of a new flag. British settlers wanted <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> Jack in the new flag as part of the British Empire while the Afrikaners did not. A compromise was reached whereby the new flag would consist of the Prince's Flag as this was the first flag raised on South Africa and a badge of <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> Jack in the centre with the flags of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic. <b>The</b> <b>Union</b> Jack was mirrored in the new flag with the hoist on the right so that it did not take precedence over the others.|$|E
