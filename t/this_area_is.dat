5|$|Southern Manitoba (including {{the city}} of Winnipeg), falls into the humid {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen Dfb). <b>This</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> cold and windy {{in the winter and}} has frequent blizzards because of the open landscape. Summers are warm with a moderate length. This region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces, with moderate precipitation. Southwestern Manitoba, though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba, is closer to the semi-arid interior of Palliser's Triangle. The area is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern Manitoba. <b>This</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards due to the openness of the prairie landscape.

5|$|After {{aftershocks}} {{from the}} quake had concluded, examination took place, producing a focal {{solution to the}} small events. Movement of these shocks {{was similar to that}} of previous earthquakes around the Azores. For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate nodal plane was responsible, seeing shearing on the right-lateral (dextral) side. All faulting in <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> strike-slip-oriented, and on a rather large scale. Because of this research, information now points towards Azores volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.|$|E

5|$|After welding, {{a number}} of {{distinct}} regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the filler metal was laid during the welding process. The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the filler metal used, and its compatibility with the base materials. It is surrounded by the heat-affected zone, the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on the base material's behavior when subjected to heat. The metal in <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> often weaker than both the base material and the fusion zone, and is also where residual stresses are found.|$|E
5|$|Although many {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} put forward {{to explain how the}} ketogenic diet works, it remains a mystery. Disproven hypotheses include systemic acidosis (high levels of acid in the blood), electrolyte changes and hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose). Although many biochemical changes are known to occur in the brain of a patient on the ketogenic diet, it is not known which of these has an anticonvulsant effect. The lack of understanding in <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> similar to the situation with many anticonvulsant drugs.|$|E

5|$|Blakeney Point, {{like most}} of the {{northern}} part of the marshes in <b>this</b> <b>area,</b> <b>is</b> part of the parish of Cley next the Sea. The main spit runs roughly west to east, and joins the mainland at Cley Beach before continuing onwards as a coastal ridge to Weybourne. It is approximately 6.4km (4mi) long, and is composed of a shingle bank which in places is 20m (65ft) in width and up to 10m (33feet) high. It has been estimated that there are 2.3millionm3 (82millionft3) of shingle in the spit, 97per cent of which is derived from flint.|$|E
5|$|East Antarctica {{is a cold}} {{region with}} a ground base above sea level and {{occupies}} most of the continent. <b>This</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows.

5|$|Following the {{departure}} of the Romans, the Sheffield area may have been {{the southern part of the}} Celtic kingdom of Elmet, with the rivers Sheaf and Don forming part of the boundary between this kingdom and the kingdom of Mercia.

An enduring Celtic presence within <b>this</b> <b>area</b> <b>is</b> evidenced by the settlements called Wales and Waleswood close to Sheffield—the word Wales derives from the Germanic word Walha, and was originally used by the Anglo-Saxons to refer to the native Britons.|$|E
