500|$|The songs [...] "Ponderosa", [...] "Strugglin'", and [...] "Hell Is Round the Corner" [...] were {{inspired}} by Tricky's experiences with marijuana, alcohol, cocaine, and ecstasy, particularly a two-year binge and consequent state of despondency while on Massive Attack's payroll {{after the completion of}} Blue Lines. His stream-of-consciousness lyrics on Maxinquaye explore the delirious, despondent, and emotionally unstable state associated with drug use while offering a pessimistic view of the drug culture, as Tricky viewed the high of cocaine undeserved and the depth of thought achieved through ecstasy unsubstantial. In Reynolds' opinion, Tricky's experiences with drug-induced paranoia, anxiety, and visions of specters and demons were represented in the production of songs such as [...] "Aftermath" [...] and [...] "Hell Is Round the Corner". For the latter track, he altered and slowed down a vocal sample to give it a wounded basso profondo sound, while channelling it through a loop of an orchestral Isaac Hayes recording titled [...] "Ike's Rap II".

Each piece of rail is [...] (forty thousandths) high and is manually affixed to the roadbed by solder to copper-clad ties placed every 5th tie. About [...] (scale miles, actually [...] ) of mainline track are on this massive layout, as well as over 500 hand-made turnouts. Many models of local San Diego structures can be identified on the layout, including an intricate scale model of San Diego's Santa Fe Depot, the Western Metal Supply Building, the Carrizo Gorge's Goat Canyon Trestle, Palomar Observatory, the American Agar building, and the Carlsbad, California flower fields and power plant. The model of the Santa Fe depot was constructed using the actual building's blueprints and has been featured on the cover of Model Railroader magazine. The Spanish revival architecture is reproduced using epoxy castings of scale model adobe roof tiles. The Western Metal Supply Building (now part of the left field foul line in the San Diego Padres' Petco Park) was constructed using historic photographs and contains brick castings, brass-etched fire escapes, and computer-generated window panes. The detail on the Goat Canyon Trestle includes the prototype's railings, catwalks, and fire suppression system. The power plant contains fibre-optic strobe lights in its chimney. Many buildings have detailed interiors, right down to the napkin dispenser and placemats on the tables at the corner cafe. Some surfers appear in the water off the coast.

40|$|Click {{models are}} an {{important}} tool for leveraging user feedback, and are used by commercial search engines for surfacing relevant search results. However, existing click models are lacking in two aspects. First, they do not share information across search results when computing attractiveness. Second, they assume that users interact with the search results sequentially. Based on our analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>click</b> logs <b>of</b> <b>a</b> commercial search engine, we observe that the sequential scan assumption does not always hold, especially for sponsored search results. To overcome the above two limitations, we propose a new click model. Our key insight is that sharing information across search results helps in identifying important words or key-phrases which can then be used to accurately compute attractiveness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> search result. Furthermore, we argue that <b>the</b> <b>click</b> probability <b>of</b> <b>a</b> position {{as well as its}} attractiveness changes during a user session and depends on <b>the</b> user's past <b>click</b> experience. Our model seamlessly incorporates the effect of externalities (quality of other search results displayed in response to a user query), user fatigue, as well as pre and post-click relevance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sponsored search result. We propose an efficient one-pass inference scheme and empirically evaluate the performance of our model via extensive experiments using <b>the</b> <b>click</b> logs <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large commercial search engine...|$|R

40|$|The {{functionalization}} of {{surfaces and}} the ability to tailor their properties with desired physico-chemical functions is <b>an</b> important field <b>of</b> research with <b>a</b> broad spectrum <b>of</b> applications. These applications range from the modification of wetting properties, over the alteration of optical properties, to the fabrication of molecular electronic devices. In each of these fields, it is of specific importance to be able to control the quality of the layers with high precision.

40|$|Titration is an {{analytical}} chemistry technique {{commonly used to}} determine the concentration <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acidic or basic solution. In general and analytical chemistry courses, students are taught about the concept of chemical equilibrium and use this concept to determine the pH of mixed acidic and basic solutions. The pH calculation can be a great challenge for many students because it involves carefully choosing and solving the proper equations under various conditions. As a result, a web-based acid/base titration calculator (dubbed e-Titrator) with a user-friendly interface is created to help students learn these pH calculations. Students may also use the e-Titrator to double check the results of their own work. In the e-Titrator interface, users first enter the concentrations and other relevant information of the titrant and analyte. Then a virtual titration is easily done at <b>the</b> <b>clicks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> “Titrate” button. <b>The</b> e-Titrator not only calculates the pH value of the mixed solutions but also provides a complete titration graph of pH vs. the volume of the titrant.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 33 - 35). Detecting and classifying odontocete species {{through their}} echolocation clicks {{has been proven}} successful by other studies, but {{the differences between the}} recordings can impact the accuracy of the classification. This thesis studies the means of properly removing background noise from the recordings and the effects of the detection and classification algorithm on <b>the</b> resulting echolocation <b>clicks,</b> using <b>the</b> species <b>of</b> Pacific White-Sided Dolphins and Risso's Dolphins. Differentiating between echolocation clicks and ambient noise is done using <b>a</b> function <b>of</b> the relative energy in the recording. An inverse transfer function is retrieved from a separate server based on the location and time at which the recording was taken, and applied to each recording in order to undo the changes made by the recording equipment's preamplifier. Echolocation clicks are further validated based on their length, energy, and frequency values to eliminate false detections. Echo sounders are also detected and removed through auto-correlating the times <b>of</b> <b>the</b> detected echolocation <b>clicks</b> and removing those found at regular intervals. <b>The</b> remaining detected <b>clicks</b> were grouped based on various criteria, including sighting, preamplifier setting, and recording site, and subjected to a 3 -fold experiment that trains GMM's with <b>the</b> <b>clicks</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few groups and tests the remaining groups using the probabilities of the models.
