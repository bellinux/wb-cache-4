5|$|The All Blacks played Glamorgan in Swansea on 21 December. The All Blacks had the {{advantage}} of the wind in the first 30 minutes. Late in the first half Roberts worked a move from a scrum to pass <b>to</b> <b>Smith,</b> who passed to Harold Abbott. Abbott then passed back <b>to</b> <b>Smith</b> who scored in the corner. In the second half Glamorgan attacked but could not score, and late in the game the All Blacks scored tries to McDonald and Wallace to win 9–0.|$|E

5|$|Apeomyoides savagei was {{described}} as a new genus and species by Kent Smith, Richard Cifelli, and Nicholas Czaplewski in 2006. The generic name, Apeomyoides, adds the Greek suffix -ides, indicating similarity, to the name of the related genus Apeomys, while the specific name, savagei, honors Donald E. Savage for his work on fossil mammals and for assistance <b>to</b> <b>Smith.</b> In the same paper, these scientists argued in favor of apeomyine affinities for Arikareeomys.|$|E
5|$|Lorne was a {{recurring}} character in seasons seven and ten in Stargate SG-1 and season two–season five in Stargate Atlantis. Smith was originally {{supposed to play}} another character in Stargate Atlantis, but the producers eventually decided to keep Lorne, since he was popular with the fans according <b>to</b> <b>Smith</b> himself. He appears {{in a total of}} 29 episodes.|$|E
50|$|At one point, Napanee {{was served}} by two railways; the Grand Trunk (Montréal-Toronto) and the Bay of Quinte Railway (Deseronto-Sydenham). The BQR was {{integrated}} into Canadian Northern Railway's mainline <b>to</b> <b>Smiths</b> Falls in 1910 and {{became part of}} CN when CNoR went bankrupt in 1918. The last fragment of this line was disconnected in 2010 at Napanee's historic Grand Trunk station; it crossed Hwy 401 to a Goodyear Tire and Rubber factory as a dead end after the rails <b>to</b> <b>Smiths</b> Falls were removed in the 1980s. The section from Strathcona <b>to</b> <b>Smiths</b> Falls is now the Cataraqui Trail.|$|R

5|$|Shortly after Smith's death, a fan {{memorial}} {{was initiated}} outside Solutions Audio (4334 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California), the site {{at which the}} cover of the Figure 8 album was shot. Farewell messages <b>to</b> <b>Smith</b> were written on the wall, and flowers, photos, candles, and empty bottles of alcohol mentioned in Smith's songs were left. Since then, the wall has been a regular target for graffiti but is regularly restored by fans.|$|E
5|$|Though {{there are}} {{doubts about the}} {{authenticity}} of the White Horse Prophecy as a whole, several sources attribute <b>to</b> <b>Smith</b> the idea that the United States Constitution would one day hang by a thread, and LDS Church leaders have issued similar warnings with regard to the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|Two {{years after}} his {{retirement}} in 1998, Smith {{went to work as}} a roving minor league pitching instructor for the San Francisco Giants. A former teammate, Dick Tidrow, and the manager of the Double-A Shreveport Captains, Jack Hiatt, offered the job <b>to</b> <b>Smith,</b> who gladly agreed, since it was right in his hometown. Smith still held this job with the Giants as of 2009.|$|E
5|$|Although Smith had {{previously}} refused {{to show the}} plates to anyone, he told Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, and David Whitmer {{that they would be}} allowed to see them. These men, known collectively as the Three Witnesses, signed a statement stating that they had been shown the golden plates by an angel, and that the voice of God had confirmed the truth of their translation. Later, a group of Eight Witnesses — composed of male members of the Whitmer and Smith families — issued a statement that they had been shown the golden plates by Smith. According <b>to</b> <b>Smith,</b> the angel Moroni took back the plates once Smith finished using them.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the bands}} that {{regularly}} played the university, including Cream, Jimi Hendrix, and Pink Floyd, they were particularly impressed by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, and recruited an organist, Nick Pearne, {{to match the}} format of Arthur Brown's band. Along with two female dancers, the initial line-up was Hammill on guitar and vocals, Smith on drums, wind instruments and vocals, and Pearne on organ (though he did not initially have an instrument). According <b>to</b> <b>Smith,</b> the band initially played as a two-piece, with Smith occasionally using a typewriter as a percussion instrument; their first gig as a three-piece was in the student union, which lasted five minutes before the group's amplifiers blew up.|$|E

5|$|Detectives also {{investigated}} {{the death of}} a woman who had been a colleague of Smith at the Rainbow. Patricia Lynott, a divorced mother of two from Ireland who had moved to Birmingham, had been found dead in her flat in October 2000. Police had not treated the death as suspicious, but after they discovered her connection <b>to</b> <b>Smith,</b> her body was exhumed for a second post mortem. This proved to be inconclusive, and in January 2003 a coroner's jury in Birmingham recorded an open verdict after hearing that the cause of her death could not be determined.|$|E
5|$|For the 2013 campaign, Ryan {{overhauled}} {{his coaching}} staff, promoting Dennis Thurman to defensive coordinator while adding several new coaches including offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg. Newly hired general manager John Idzik emphasized {{there would be}} competition at all positions including quarterback. The Jets drafted Geno Smith {{in the second round}} of the 2013 NFL Draft to compete with Sanchez. Ryan was widely criticized for his decision to insert Sanchez late in a preseason game against the New York Giants after Sanchez suffered a season-ending shoulder injury which led <b>to</b> <b>Smith</b> being named the starter.|$|E
5|$|NASCAR {{spokesperson}} Jim Hunter however insisted Smith was {{not forced}} below the yellow line, and stated drivers were warned beforehand in the pre-race drivers' meeting about gaining a position illegally. Earnhardt felt Smith deserved {{to win the}} race, saying {{there was a lack}} of clarity over what going below the yellow line meant. Smith stated he did not ask for clarification of the rule because of his low-profile status. NASCAR president Mike Helton stated that race officials had correctly awarded the penalty <b>to</b> <b>Smith,</b> and clarified that no driver would be allowed to advance their position by going below the yellow line at any time during a race. Similarities were also made between Smith's overtake, and Earnhardt's pass of Kenseth below the yellow line at Talladega at the 2003 Aaron's 499.|$|E

5|$|On October 26, 2014, Smith caught four {{passes for}} 51-yards and two {{touchdown}}s, as he helped Joe Flacco set the NFL {{record for the}} fastest time to record five touchdown passes (16 minutes and 3 seconds). The Ravens defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 48-17. The following week, against the Atlanta Falcons, Smith would score the game-sealing touchdown. With {{less than two minutes}} left in the game and facing a fourth down, Flacco threw a pass <b>to</b> <b>Smith,</b> and he caught it in for a 39-yard score. Smith would finish the game with three receptions, 81 yards and the 39 yard touchdown, as the Ravens won of 29-7.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{grew up in}} {{a wrestling}} family and enjoyed going to wrestling shows, where she claims she and her {{siblings}} were treated like celebrities. Smith later decided to become a professional wrestler and trained, along with her sister-in-law Nickla Roberts (known by her ring name Baby Doll), under Nelson Royal. During 1987, Smith competed as Rockin' Robin in Wild West Wrestling, where she feuded with Debbie Combs and Sue Green. When the WWF decided to restart their women's division in the late 1980s, both women tried out for the company, but the role ultimately went <b>to</b> <b>Smith.</b> Smith, as Rockin' Robin, debuted in the WWF in late 1987. She competed at the first Survivor Series as a member of The Fabulous Moolah's team. Throughout 1988, she feuded with Sensational Sherri for the WWF Women's Championship.|$|E
