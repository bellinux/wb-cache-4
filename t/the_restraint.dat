5|$|To access these songs, after {{lowering}} <b>the</b> <b>restraint,</b> on the screen, riders must {{push and}} hold the logo of the ride for approximately ten seconds. When they release their finger, a number pad will then show up. Entering a three digit code will allow the rider {{to listen to the}} song that the code corresponds to.|$|E
5|$|After riders {{board the}} train and lower their restraint, {{attached}} to <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> is a small screen containing the logo of the ride and five categories of songs the rider can pick from. The song that the rider picked begins as the train climbs the vertical lift hill. Depending on the song, it may not begin {{at the beginning and}} end early as the total cycle time of the roller coaster is 1 minute and 39 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Ip {{figures out}} that Lin was beaten {{and killed by}} the Japanese after an earlier fight. Barely able to contain his rage, Ip demands a match with ten karateka at once. Despite having not practiced Wing Chun since the Japanese {{occupied}} their town (to conserve energy and thus food for his family), he mercilessly defeats all of them with a brutal and effective barrage of blows, showing none of <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> he exhibited in earlier matches. His skill arouses the interest of General Miura, who wants {{to learn more about}} Ip and watch him fight again.|$|E
50|$|Most {{patients}} {{who find themselves}} restrained naturally think they can free themselves by pulling hard at <b>the</b> <b>restraints.</b> But <b>the</b> <b>restraints</b> are made out of plastic mesh, which cannot be broken by being pulled with human strength. Other patients attempt to unfasten <b>the</b> <b>restraints</b> around <b>the</b> wrist, but find they cannot reach the fastener unless they have abnormally flexible joints. Some do manage to slip their hands through the cuff, though competent workers prevent this from happening.|$|R
50|$|When Rugrats Runaway Reptar {{became so}} immensely popular at Paramount's Kings Island, the then-owners, Paramount {{decided to build}} {{a copy of the}} ride at Carowinds. Rugrats Runaway Reptar opened in 2003 at Paramount's Carowinds. The ride is exactly the same; paint color and all. The only {{difference}} is the color of <b>the</b> shoulder <b>restraints.</b> At Carowinds, <b>the</b> <b>restraints</b> are red and perhaps more bulky. At Kings Island, <b>the</b> <b>restraints</b> are yellow and had more padding.|$|R
5|$|X-Flight {{operates}} {{with two}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train has 8 cars with 4 seats per car (2 {{on each side}} of the track) for a total of 32 riders per train. The colors of the train are red and black with over-the-shoulder <b>restraints.</b> <b>The</b> <b>restraints</b> are similar to <b>the</b> <b>restraints</b> found on Superman: Ultimate Flight.|$|R
5|$|The Giant Dipper {{currently}} operates {{with two}} trains with six cars per train. Riders are arranged two across in two rows {{for a total}} of 24 riders per train. The trains were built by Dana Morgan from D.H. Morgan Manufacturing. When the Giant Dipper opened, it ran with three trains, each with ten cars. Over time, the trains have been redesigned several times with changes to <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> system. However, they are almost unchanged since they opened. The trains have changed colors several times since the ride opened.|$|E
5|$|The {{roller coaster}} {{operates}} with seven stadium-style seating X-Car trains. Each train has two cars that can hold six riders each {{for a total}} of twelve riders per train. On the head rest of each seat there are two speakers that play music during the ride. The speakers have been designed so that only the rider's selected music track will be audible. On <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> is a small touch screen where riders can choose which song they want to listen to during the ride. Additionally, the trains are equipped with multi-coloured lights that can be seen during the night.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, British {{claims to}} a West African sphere of {{influence}} received recognition from other European nations at the Berlin Conference. The following year, it chartered the Royal Niger Company {{under the leadership of}} Sir George Taubman Goldie. In 1900 the company's territory came {{under the control of the}} British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British protectorate, and part of the British Empire, the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered Benin in 1897, and, in the Anglo-Aro War (1901–1902), defeated other opponents. <b>The</b> <b>restraint</b> or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.|$|E

5|$|Superman the Ride has {{undergone}} numerous safety upgrades. After the 2001 incident, the PVC airlines were replaced with steel reinforced air hoses {{to prevent a}} similar accident from occurring. After the 2004 incident, metal bars were installed {{on both sides of}} the “T-bar” restraint, encasing the rider's legs. Shin restraints were added to the lower portion of <b>the</b> <b>restraint,</b> preventing riders’ feet from leaving the car. In addition, all of the seat belts on both 36-passenger trains were replaced with ones at a consistent length, as well as a “go or no go” belt for each seat and “T-bar” restraint. The “go or no go” belt ensured the “T-bar” restraint was in an effective position before leaving the station. During the 2009 rebranding, new trains were deployed with new restraints added. The new lapbars eliminated the center pole, leaving only the exterior poles. New seat belts provided more strength and were less likely to come undone unintentionally.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} for applying for {{an order for}} review of detention differs from that for obtaining a mandatory order, prohibiting order or quashing order because the latter orders are only available by leave of court, whereas an order for review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court. The {{procedure for}} doing so is set out in Order 54 of the Rules of Court. An application {{must be made to}} the High Court by way of an ex parte originating summons, supported, if possible, by an affidavit from the person being restrained which shows that the application is being made at his or her instance and explaining the nature of <b>the</b> <b>restraint.</b> If the person under restraint is unable to personally make an affidavit, someone may do so on his or her behalf, explaining the reason for the inability.|$|E
5|$|Starscream, {{having been}} humiliated {{at the hands}} of Megatron, infiltrates Shockwave's towers and sabotages his lab equipment. In the lab he finds Grimlock being held prisoner. He offers Grimlock freedom in {{exchange}} for his fealty, but Grimlock escapes by grabbing and throwing Starscream into <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> controls, killing him. He reunites with his teammates Swoop, Slug, and Snarl; then proceeds to kill the defending Insecticons and the swarm leaders named Hardshell, Kickback and Sharpshot. Grimlock learns from Shockwave that their processors were tampered with, leaving Grimlock with a speech impairment. By way of his Space Bridge, Shockwave also found a new planet inhabited by large creatures; these were used to inspire all of their new alternate forms. Grimlock was further modified, and now cannot transform on command, but must be in a state of rage to do so. He recalls a name that Sharpshot gave them, the Dinobots, and claims it as their new team name. Then he notices another Space Bridge tower that Shockwave has constructed nearby. Grimlock fights his way to Shockwave, biting his left arm off and rigging the tower to explode. The crumbling tower falls, killing Grimlock and Shockwave in the process and the portal in Cybertron's orbit begins to decay as the remaining three Dinobots watch in horror.|$|E

The algorithms convert <b>the</b> <b>restraints</b> and <b>the</b> general protein properties into energy terms, and then try to minimize this energy. The process results in an ensemble of structures that, if the data were sufficient to dictate a certain fold, will converge.|$|R

5|$|The War of the Bavarian Succession was {{the last}} war for both Frederick and Maria Theresa, whose reigns began and ended with wars against one another. Although they {{deployed}} armies {{three to four times}} the size of the armies of the Seven Years' War, neither monarch used the entirety of the military force each had at his or her disposal, making this war-without-battles remarkable. Despite <b>the</b> <b>restraint</b> of the monarchs, some early nineteenth-century casualty estimates suggest that tens of thousands died of starvation and hunger-related disease. Carlyle's more moderate estimate lies at about ten thousand Prussian and probably another ten thousand Austrian dead. Michael Hochedlinger assesses combined casualties at approximately thirty thousand; Robert Kann gives no estimate of casualties but suggests the primary causes of death were cholera and dysentery. Gaston Bodart, whose 1915 work is still considered the authority on Austrian military losses, is specific: five Austrian generals (he does not name them), over twelve thousand soldiers, and 74officers died of disease. In minor actions and skirmishes, nine officers and 265men were killed and four officers and 123men were wounded, but not fatally. Sixty-two officers and 2,802men were taken prisoner, and 137men were missing. Over three thousand Imperial soldiers deserted. Finally, twenty-six officers and 372men were discharged with disabilities. Bodart also gives Prussian losses: one general killed (he does not say which), 87officers and 3,364 men killed, wounded or captured. Overall, he assumes losses of ten percent of the fighting force. Little has been discovered of civilian casualties, although certainly the civilians also suffered from starvation and disease. There were other damages: for example, Habelschwerdt and one of its hamlets were destroyed by fire.|$|E
