5|$|The most {{significant}} {{aspect of the}} book was Wright's method for dividing the meridian; an explanation of how he had constructed a table for the division; and the uses of this information for navigation. Essentially, the problem that occupied Wright was how to depict accurately a globe on a two-dimensional map according to the projection used by Gerardus Mercator in his map of 1569. Mercator's projection was advantageous for nautical purposes as it represented lines of constant true bearing or <b>true</b> <b>course,</b> known as loxodromes or rhumb lines, as straight lines. However, Mercator had not explained his method.|$|E
25|$|The recolada {{begins its}} spread across Lusitania, {{converting}} the formerly lethal virus into a harmless aid to native life. The cure {{to the people}} of Path's genetic-controlling defect is distributed, yet Han Fei-tzu is tragically unable to convince his daughter Qing-jao this was the <b>true</b> <b>course</b> of action. Confronted with the possibility of being lied to all her life and dooming many sentient species to destruction, or an alternative of believing all she ever loved and trusted has betrayed her – Demosthenes, her father, her friend, her world. Qing-jao instead continues her godspoken rite of woodgrain tracing until her death and is honored by those on Path who still believe in the gods as the last true godspoken. She is elevated to god status after her death. Si Wang-mu sets off with Peter to take control over Starways Congress to stop the Fleet closing in on Lusitania. The new Valentine-persona journeys to find a planet to which the population of Lusitania can evacuate. The stage is set for the final book of the four-part series, Children of the Mind.|$|E

LeMay took double drifts until the B-17s had to separate to transit a cold front. At 11:15 they reassembled in clear weather on the other side, where LeMay checked their course again. He calculated an intercept time of 12:25 for his pilot, who in turn passed it to Meloy to schedule the live radio broadcast. At noon the B-17s encountered an area of [...] "scattered rain squalls," [...] spreading into a line abreast formation with the aircraft [...] apart to increase their chances of spotting the Rex.|$|E

500|$|Whatever the <b>true</b> <b>course</b> of events, Theodore's {{unexpected}} victory echoed {{throughout the}} Greek world, and greatly enhanced his standing; even the usually hostile Akropolites {{was forced to}} admit in his history that this feat was [...] "of great help to the Romans". Conversely it dismayed Pope Honorius, who sent letters to the Latin princes of Greece {{as well as the}} Doge of Venice and Peter of Courtenay's son-in-law King Andrew II of Hungary (r. 1205–35), urging them to engage themselves to secure the release of Peter and Colonna. He even wrote to Andrew and the French bishops to call for a crusade against Theodore, with which he also threatened Theodore in a letter. With the first contingents for the crusade assembling at Ancona in late 1217, and the Venetians eager to profit from the crusade to recover Dyrrhachium, the pressure bore fruit: in March 1218, Colonna was released, with Theodore offering his apologies and assurances of loyalty to the Pope. Honorius then changed his policy to the point of forbidding the Doge of Venice to harm Theodore in the slightest, hoping thereby to secure the release of more prisoners. Although some of the lesser barons were freed, Peter and many of the most senior lords remained in captivity until their death. It is unknown when Peter of Courtenay died, but this was probably before September 1219.|$|E

2500|$|After Last Poems (1918) Gippius {{published}} {{two more}} books of verse, Poems. 1911–1920 Diaries (1922) and The Shining Ones (1939). Her poetry, prose and essays published in emigration were utterly pessimistic; the 'rule of beastliness', {{the ruins of}} human culture, and the demise of civilization were her major themes. Most valuable for Gippius were her diaries: she saw these flash points of personal history as essential for helping future generations to restore the <b>true</b> <b>course</b> of events. Yet, as a modern Russian critic has put it, [...] "Gippius's legacy, for all its inner drama and antinomy, its passionate, forceful longing for the unfathomable, has always borne the ray of hope, the fiery, unquenchable belief in a higher truth and the ultimate harmony crowning a person's destiny. As she herself wrote {{in one of her}} last poems, [...] "Alas, now they are torn apart: the timelessness and all things human / But time will come and both will intertwine into one shimmering eternity'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ruskin {{toured the}} {{continent}} again {{with his parents}} in 1844, visiting Chamonix and Paris, studying the geology of the Alps and the paintings of Titian, Veronese and Perugino among others at the Louvre. In 1845, {{at the age of}} 26, he undertook to travel without his parents for the first time. It provided him with an opportunity to study medieval art and architecture in France, Switzerland and especially Italy. In Lucca he saw the Tomb of Ilaria del Carretto by Jacopo della Quercia which Ruskin considered the exemplar of Christian sculpture (he later associated it with the object of his love, Rose La Touche). He drew inspiration from what he saw at the Campo Santo in Pisa, and in Florence. He was particularly impressed by the works of Fra Angelico and Giotto in San Marco, and Tintoretto in the Scuola di San Rocco but was alarmed by the combined effects of decay and modernisation on Venice: [...] "Venice is lost to me," [...] he wrote. It crystallised his lifelong conviction that to restore was to destroy, and that the only <b>true</b> <b>course</b> was preservation and conservation.|$|E
