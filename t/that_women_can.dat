5|$|At times Shelley {{had trouble}} finding {{sufficient}} research materials {{and had to}} make do with fewer resources than she would have liked, particularly for the Spanish and Portuguese Lives. She wrote in a style that combined secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, and her own opinions. Her political views are most obvious in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>can</b> be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E

25|$|Some Modern Orthodox {{leaders have}} held <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>can</b> serve as public Megillah readers.

Among the benefits are <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>can</b> spend more time with their children, earn additional income, and sell surplus water to neighbours. This money contributes to her repayment of the WaterCredit loan. The initiative is supported by the US-based non-profit Water Partners International.|$|E
25|$|She {{returned}} to the Upper East Side and studied there at the Brearley School from 1942-1944, but was dismissed for painting in red the fig leaves on the school's classical statuary. Despite this, she would later say it was there “ I became a feminist. They inculcated in us <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>can</b> and must accomplish great things.” She was then enrolled in a convent school in Suffern, New York, but was expelled. She finally graduated from the Oldfields School in Glencoe, Maryland in 1947.|$|E

25|$|In {{her book}} Los hechos desconocidos (The unknown facts) she denounced the corruption, abuses and {{unhealthy}} {{practices in the}} municipal hospital of San Juan. Gonzale's publication convinced James R. Beverly, the Interim Governor of Puerto Rico, to sign Ley 77 (Law 77) in May 1930. The law established a Nurses Examining Board responsible for setting and enforcing standards of nursing education and practices. It also stipulated that the Board of Medical Examiners include two nurses. The passage of Ley 77 proved <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>can</b> operate both in the formal public sphere while working in a female oriented field. In 1978, González became the first recipient of the Public Health Department of Puerto Rico G"arrido Morales Award".|$|E
25|$|The FARC as an {{organization}} also reserves a place for women fighters. According to the FARC, they invite all the Colombian women to join in what they consider as their struggle against the injustices of society. In May 1964, {{there were only two}} female fighters in the FARC's precursor rebel group, but now it is believed by some analysts that women may make up a third of the FARC's fighters. Internal FARC regulations state that the status of women in FARC is considered to be equal to that of men, and <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>can</b> be present in all units, from small squads to entire fronts. Women usually are not grouped together in specific units, {{as was the case in}} other countries, and they can also participate in all military operations.|$|E
25|$|In 1983 {{a number}} of Conservative rabbis issued responsa on the same subject, arguing <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>can</b> and should be counted in the prayer minyan. These papers were written {{as part of the}} process of JTS {{deciding}} on whether or not to admit women to its rabbinic and cantorial programs. However, the Chancellor of JTS at the time took this process out of the hands of the CJLS, and made the process an affair of the JTS faculty, a move that caused strong controversy, and several resignations of Talmud faculty from JTS. The decision to allow women to become rabbinical and cantorial candidates was then based on a vote of JTS faculty, in principle based on their readings of these responsa and their own understanding of the relevant texts.|$|E

25|$|Of all {{the churches}} in the Liberal Catholic movement, only the {{original}} church, the Liberal Catholic Church under Bishop Graham Wale, does not ordain women. The position held by the Liberal Catholic Church is that the Church, even if it wanted to ordain women, {{does not have the}} authority to do so and {{that it would not be}} possible for a woman to become a priest even if she went through the ordination ceremony. The reasoning behind this belief is that the female body does not effectively channel the masculine energies of Christ, the true minister of all the sacraments. The priest has to be able to channel Christ's energies to validly confect the sacrament; therefore priests must be male. When discussing the sacrament of Holy Orders in his book Science of the Sacraments, Second Presiding Bishop Leadbeater confirmed that women could not be ordained; he noted that Christ left no indication <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>can</b> become priests and that only Christ can change this arrangement.|$|E
25|$|How a child {{develops}} {{gender identity}} is also debated. Some believe that masculinity {{is linked to}} the male body; in this view, masculinity is associated with male genitalia. Others have suggested that although masculinity may be influenced by biology, it is also a cultural construct. Recent research has been done on one's self concept of masculinity and its relation to testosterone; the results have shown that masculinity not only differs in different cultures, but the levels of testosterone do not predict how masculine or feminine one feels. Proponents of this view argue <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>can</b> become men hormonally and physically, and many aspects of masculinity assumed to be natural are linguistically and culturally driven. On the nurture side of the debate, it is argued that masculinity does not have a single source. Although the military has a vested interest in constructing and promoting a specific form of masculinity, it does not create it. Facial hair is linked to masculinity through language, in stories about boys becoming men when they begin to shave.|$|E
25|$|Adolescent {{girls and}} boys who are {{attracted}} to others {{of the same sex}} are strongly affected by their surroundings in that adolescents often decide to express their sexualities or keep them secret depending on certain factors in their societies. These factors affect {{girls and boys}} differently. If girls’ schools and religions are against same sex attractions, they pose the greatest obstacles to girls who experience same sex attractions. These factors were not listed as affecting boys as much. The researchers suggest that maybe this is because not only are some religions against same-sex attraction, but they also encourage traditional roles for women and do not believe <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>can</b> carry out these roles as lesbians. Schools may affect girls more than boys because strong emphasis is placed on girls to date boys, and many school activities place high importance on heterosexuality (such as cheerleading). Additionally, the idea of not conforming to typical male gender roles inhibited many boys from openly expressing their same-sex attraction. The worry of conforming to gender roles didn’t inhibit girls from expressing their same-gender preferences as much, because society is generally more flexible about their gender expression.|$|E

25|$|The {{membership}} of the PCA is predominantly Caucasian, but the denomination includes more than 260 Korean-American Churches in 9 Korean Presbyteries. The first Korean Presbytery was formed in 1982; since then the number of presbyteries has grown to 9, namely the Korean Capital Presbytery, the Korean Central Presbytery, the Korean Eastern Presbytery, the Korean Northeastern Presbytery, the Korean Northwest Presbytery, the Korean Southeastern Presbytery, the Korean Southern Presbytery and the Korean Southwest Presbytery, and the recently formed Korean Southwest Orange County Presbytery. Koreans comprise approximately 15% of the denomination, {{and the majority of}} them are located in the West coast and Northeast regions. In recent years several independent Korean congregations have joined the PCA {{to be a part of}} a conservative Presbyterian denomination. The largest PCA church is a Korean church located in Anaheim, CA called Sarang Community Church. All the Korean churches in the PCA appoint non-ordained deaconesses and women encouragers (Kwonsa) who are elected and installed so <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>can</b> care for other women in the church. Such has been the practice of all Korean Presbyterian churches since its inception which is practiced across denominational boundaries.|$|E
25|$|Although the Talmud {{states that}} women are obligated to say birkat hamazon and that accordingly, three women can {{constitute}} a zimmun and lead it (Berachot 45b), later authorities, such as Maimonides and the Mishnah Berurah, held that women were exempt from leading a zimmun on grounds that women were not generally sufficiently educated to know how. A number of Modern Orthodox authorities have held that because of improvements in women's religious education women can now do so, and some {{say that they are}} now obligated to. Accordingly, women forming a zimmun and leading birkat hamazon has become increasingly common in Modern Orthodox circles. Such authorities disagree, however, on the appropriateness of women leading a zimmun in the presence of men (or of three men). A minority of Modern Orthodox authorities, citing earlier authorities including Meiri, Sefer HaMeorot and the Shiltei HaGibborim, also hold that 10 women can (or should) constitute a minyan for purposes of saying Zimmun B'Shem for birkat hamazon. Unlike in Conservative or Reform Judaism, even Orthodox authorities who hold <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>can</b> form a zimmun maintain that one cannot be formed from a combination of men and women.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft {{was not as}} {{receptive}} to Rousseau’s ideas as she was to Locke’s; she appropriated the aesthetic of the sublime to challenge Rousseau's ideas regarding the education of women (discussed in more detail below). During the 18th century, [...] "the sublime" [...] was associated with awe, fear, strength and masculinity. As Myers writes, [...] "to convey her message for female readers that achievement comes from within, Wollstonecraft substitutes the strength, force, and mental expansion associated with heroic sublime for the littleness, delicacy, and beauty that Rousseau and aestheticians such as Edmund Burke equate with womanhood". [...] Unlike writers such as Rousseau and Burke, who portray women as innately weak and silly, Wollstonecraft argues <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>can</b> indeed achieve the intellectual heights associated with the sublime.|$|E
500|$|Violet McKenzie {{was nine}} years older than her husband Cecil, but she outlived him by 23 years. After his death in 1958, she shared her house for a time with Cecil's sister Jean, a primary school teacher. In May 1977, after a stroke paralysed her right side and {{confined}} her to a wheelchair, McKenzie moved to the nearby Glenwood Nursing Home. She died peacefully in her sleep on 23 May 1982. At her funeral service, held at the Church of St Giles in Greenwich, 24 serving WRANS formed a Guard of Honour. McKenzie was cremated at the Northern Suburbs Crematorium. The June 1982 edition of the newsletter of the Ex-WRANS Association was devoted to their former teacher and patron. Amongst the memories recorded therein is a statement McKenzie made two days before she died: [...] "...it is finished, and I have proved to them all <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>can</b> be as good as, or better than men." ...|$|E
500|$|Wollstonecraft {{assumes that}} the [...] "daughters" [...] in her book will one day become mothers and teachers. She does not propose that women abandon these {{traditional}} roles, because she believes <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>can</b> most effectively improve society as pedagogues. Wollstonecraft and other writers {{as diverse as the}} evangelical moralist Hannah More, the historian Catharine Macaulay, and the feminist novelist Mary Hays, argue that since women are the primary caregivers of the family and educators of children, they should be given a sound education. Thoughts is insistent, following Locke and associationist psychology, that a poor education and an early marriage will ruin a woman. Wollstonecraft argues that if no attention is paid to girls as they are growing, they will turn out poorly and marry while still intellectual and emotional children. Such wives, she contends, perform no useful role in society and, indeed, contribute to its immorality. She expanded upon this argument five years later in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman.|$|E
