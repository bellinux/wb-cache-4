Tidal interactions have stripped away much of the mass from Palomar 5, and further interactions as it passes through the galactic core are expected to transform it into a long stream of stars orbiting the Milky Way halo.|$|E
5|$|By mid-morning, Ney {{had moved}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> with Gazan's brigade {{and he could}} see the enemy {{advancing}} toward him; still expecting Soult's reinforcements on his flanks, he anticipated an easy victory, like the one three days earlier in which Masséna's force had pounded Hotze's column at Frauenfeld. He did not realise, at least not yet, that Hotze had 8,000men with which to secure the crossroads north of Winterthur. Ney brought more of his men to the front, and moved against the Austrian left. In an Austrian volley, he and his horse went down; the horse was killed and Ney received a knee injury. He had his wound bandaged, called for another horse, and reentered the fight.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys albiventer is a {{large and}} long-tailed Oryzomys. The upperparts are brightly ochraceous, {{becoming}} grayer <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b> The hairs on the underparts are pale gray near the bases and white in the outer half, so that the underparts appear pale grayish according to Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales (not white as claimed by Merriman). The tail is dark above and light below. The skull and molars are relatively robust. O.albiventer has broad zygomatic arches (cheekbones), long incisive foramina (perforations of the palate between the incisors and the molars), and long nasal bones that extend behind the premaxillary bones. Compared to its lowland relative O.couesi mexicanus, O.albiventer is larger and more brightly colored and has larger molars but narrower incisive foramina.|$|E

The chromosome count for this species is 2n=44.|$|E
5|$|The skull is {{flattened}} {{in general}} shape. The front part {{is short and}} broad. The broad interorbital region (located between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped, with squared edges and weakly developed beading. A postorbital ridge is present, obscuring the suture (joint) between the frontal and squamosal bones, a feature shared only with Holochilus among oryzomyines. The braincase is squarish. The interparietal bone is wide, but does not reach the squamosals on the sides. The zygomatic arches, which are well-developed, are furthest apart at the back and converge <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b> The jugal bone is small.|$|E

She soon feels the steering wheel move by itself and the car advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree and steps in front of the car. Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the tree that claimed Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house.|$|E
5|$|On M1, the anterocone (the cusp at {{the front}} of the tooth) is not divided into smaller cuspules. The {{connection}} between the protocone and the paracone, the major cusps immediately after the anterocone, is located relatively far <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b> Behind the paracone, the mesoloph accessory crest is present. On M2, there is no protoflexus (an indentation in front of the protocone, which on this tooth is the frontmost cusp) and the valley between the paracone and the mesoloph, the mesoflexus, is not divided into two pieces by a paracone–mesoloph connection. These traits are both characteristic of the Nectomys subclade. The mesoloph is present on M3, but the posteroloph, a crest at the back of the tooth, is absent or vestigial, as is the hypoflexus (the valley between the protocone and the cusp behind it, the hypocone). The absence or near-absence of the posteroloph is a distinctive trait that differentiates Pennatomys from related oryzomyines.|$|E
5|$|The front root {{is larger}} than the back one. In side view, the upper and back margins are straight, but the front margin is convex. There are eight cusps {{arranged}} in a row on the upper margin, the first of which is located about one third of the tooth's length from the front margin. Only the last is slightly worn, indicating that the tooth is from a young animal. Long ridges extend from the cusps diagonally <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> on both the lingual and labial (outer) sides of the tooth. The first seven ridges on both sides are connected to the respective cusps, but the eighth ridges do not quite reach their cusp. On both sides of the tooth, there is also a small ridge behind the eighth ridge that extends to the back margin; these ridges are called the posterolabial and posterolingual ridge. An even smaller ridge is located below the ridge on the lingual side.|$|E

5|$|The skull {{has a long}} rostrum (front part), broad interorbital region (between the eyes), and low braincase. It {{differs from}} that of T.bolivaris in various proportions, which are more {{apparent}} in adults than in juveniles. The skull of H.megacephalus is distinctly larger. The zygomatic plate is broad and includes a well-developed zygomatic notch at its front. Its back margin is level with the front of the first upper molar. The zygomatic arch (cheekbone) is heavy. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend about as far backward. The interorbital region is narrowest <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and shows weak beading at its margins; T.bolivaris is similar, but has stronger beading and H.megacephalus entirely lacks the beading. The parietal bone is usually limited to the roof of the braincase and does not extend to its side, as it does in most T.bolivaris. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, is large.|$|E
5|$|Operation Tractable {{began at}} 12:00 on 14 August, when 800 Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax heavy bombers of RAF Bomber Command struck German {{positions}} along the front. As with Totalize, {{many of the}} bombers mistakenly dropped their bombs short of their targets, causing 400 Polish and Canadian casualties. Covered by a smoke screen laid down by their artillery, two Canadian divisions moved forwards. Although their line of sight was reduced, German units still managed to inflict severe casualties on the Canadian 4th Armoured Division, which included its Armoured Brigade commander Brigadier Leslie Booth, as the division moved south toward Falaise. Throughout the day, continual attacks by the Canadian 4th and Polish 1st Armoured Divisions managed to force a crossing of the Laison River. Limited access to the crossing points over the Dives River allowed counterattacks by the German 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. The town of Potigny fell to Polish forces in the late afternoon. By {{the end of the}} first day, elements of the Canadian 3rd and 4th Divisions had reached Point 159, directly north of Falaise, although they had been unable to break into the town. To bolster his offensive, Simonds ordered the Canadian 2nd Infantry Division to move <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> with the hope that this reinforcement would be sufficient to enable his divisions to capture the town.|$|E
5|$|The cusp at {{the front}} of M1, the anterocone, is {{separated}} into two smaller cusps by an indentation. In A.donovani, a ridge generally connects the two cusps {{at the front}} margin of the tooth, so that the indentation separating them is closed at the front (an anteromedian fossette), but in A.praeuniversitatis, it is open <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> (an anteromedian flexus). An additional crest, the anteroloph, is present behind the anterocone. Further to the back, there is a pair of cusps—the protocone at the lingual, or inner, side and the paracone at the labial, or outer, side. A crest issues from the paracone and is attached to the front or middle part of the protocone. Behind the paracone, the mesoloph crest is present; an additional crest usually connects the two. At the back of the tooth, there are two additional large cusps—the hypocone (lingual) and metacone (labial)—and a prominent crest, the posteroloph, issues from the hypocone and is located behind the metacone. In A.donovani, the metacone is generally connected to the posteroloph, but in A.praeuniversitatis, it is directly connected to the hypocone. The valleys that separate the cusps extend from the lingual and labial margins to about the midline of the molar. In addition to a large root at the front and two large roots at the back (one labial, one lingual) there is a small additional labial root.|$|E

40|$|International audienceParallel {{master-slave}} evolutionary algorithms easily lead to linear speed-ups in {{the case}} of a small number of nodes [...] . and homogeneous computational costs of the evaluations. However, modern computer now routinely have several hundreds of nodes [...] and in many real-world applications in which fitness computation involves heavy numerical simulations, the computational costs of these simulations can greatly vary from one individual to the next. A simple answer to the latter problem is to use asynchronous steady-state reproduction schemes. But the resulting algorithms then differ from the original sequential version, with two consequences: First, the linear speed-up does not hold any more; Second, the convergence might be hindered by the heterogeneity of the evaluation costs. The multi-objective optimization of a diesel engine is first presented, a real-world case study where evaluations require several hours of CPU, and are very heterogeneous in terms of CPU cost. Both the speed-up of asynchronous parallel master/slave algorithms in case of large number of nodes, and their convergence <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Pareto <b>Front</b> in case of heterogeneous computation times, are then experimentally analyzed on artificial test functions. An alternative selection scheme involving the computational cost of the fitness evaluation is then proposed, that counteracts the effects of heterogeneity on convergence <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Pareto <b>Front...</b>|$|R
40|$|It {{is crucial}} to obtain {{automatically}} and efficiently a well-distributed set of Pareto optimal solutions in multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs).

However, most theoretically, convergent MOEAs necessitate certain prior knowledge about <b>the</b> Pareto <b>front</b> in order to efficiently maintain widespread solutions. In this paper, we propose, based on the new E-dominance concept, an Adaptive Rectangle Archiving (ARA) strategy that overcomes this important problem.

5|$|The upper incisors are opisthodont (with {{the cutting}} surface {{oriented}} backwards) and have orange to yellow enamel. The upper molar rows are either almost parallel or slightly convergent {{with each other}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>front.</b> Holochilus and Lundomys are the only other oryzomyines with non-parallel molar rows. The valleys between the cusps of the upper molars extending from {{the inner and outer}} sides overlap slightly across the midlines of the teeth. The molars are high-cusped, almost hypsodont. On M1, the anterocone (the front cusp) is divided into two cuspules on the lingual (inner, towards the tongue) and labial (outer, towards the lips) sides of the teeth. The mesoloph, a crest near the middle of the labial side of the tooth, is long and well developed on each of the three upper molars. On the lower molars (m1 to m3), the cusps on the labial side are located slightly in front of their lingual counterparts. The anteroconid, the front cusp on the m1, is divided in two. The m1, m2, and usually m3 have a mesolophid, a crest corresponding to the mesoloph but located on the lingual side. Each of the lower molars has two roots.|$|E
