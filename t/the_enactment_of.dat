5|$|By the 1910s, {{the use of}} breaker boys was {{dropping}} because of improvements in technology, stricter child labor laws, and <b>the</b> <b>enactment</b> <b>of</b> compulsory education laws.

5|$|Since most {{senators}} were former magistrates, {{the senate}} became bound {{together by a}} strong sense of collegiality. At any given point in time, many of the senate's most senior members were ex-Consuls, which facilitated the creation of a bond between the presiding Consul and those senior members. In addition, the Consul was always chosen from senate, and as such he usually held similar ideals as did his fellow senators. When his annual term ended, he returned to their ranks, and so he was unlikely to stand against his fellow senators. Before <b>the</b> <b>enactment</b> <b>of</b> the Ovinian Law, Consuls appointed new senators, but after <b>the</b> <b>enactment</b> <b>of</b> this law, Censors appointed new senators, which caused the senate to become even more independent of the presiding Consul. In addition, the Ovinian Law all but required that ex-magistrates be appointed to the senate, and as such, the process by which Censors appointed new members to the senate became quite objective. This further enhanced the competence, and thus the prestige, of the senate.|$|E
