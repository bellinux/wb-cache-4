500|$|Despite the {{favorable}} reviews and good chart {{position of the}} lead single, 1000 Fires did not achieve mainstream success. Lords later commented: [...] "The problem with that album {{was that it was}} ahead of its time. Electronica was just starting to happen. Moby was just starting to be huge. I opened for Thrill Kill Kult and Moby as a DJ back then. The masses didn't know who Moby was. I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had been slightly delayed it would have done better. Madonna had it right to wait for Ray of Light. She has been a lot better with her timing than me. I am proud of that album because I hear it now and it still feels current. It doesn't feel dated." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 2008, Weitz told The Daily Yomiuri, a Japanese newspaper, that {{he still}} hoped for the sequels' production: [...] "at first it looked like we were down for the count because in the U.S. [...] under{{performed}}, but then internationally it performed [...] than expectations. So, {{a lot depends on}} Japan, frankly... I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> does well enough here we'll be in good shape for that." [...] Although producer Deborah Forte had, in March 2008, expressed optimism that the sequels would be made, by October 2008, the two planned sequels were officially placed on hold, according to New Line Cinema, because of financial concerns during the global recession. Sam Elliott, however, stated, [...] "The Catholic Church ... lambasted them, and I think it scared New Line off." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Faith No More {{was brought}} up in a 1999 {{interview}} with The A.V. Club, Patton (then fronting Mr. Bungle) stated [...] "I'm definitely glad it's over: It was a great thing while it lasted, but it really had to end. I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> had continued it would have gotten really ugly. No fistfights or bloody noses or anything like that, but the music would have been substandard. So the line must be drawn there." [...] In another interview from 2001, he similarly stated that the band had broken up [...] "because we were starting to make bad music." [...] However, Gould did not share the same sentiment as Patton {{on the quality of the}} band's late material, stating in 1998 [...] "However many records we sold or didn't, we maintained over a long [...] period of time a high standard of music that we're proud of, and we never sucked. Whatever shit that happened to us on the way, thank God it didn't get in the way of the music." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{is for you}} to find out, Betty," [...] I said. [...] "By {{the time}} you come back you will have {{discovered}} <b>it,</b> I <b>think.</b> <b>If</b> not, <b>it</b> will not have proved itself a good reason and shall be forgotten." ...|$|R

5000|$|During the campaign, Kennedy was {{frequently}} met by large crowds. Keating accused Kennedy {{of being a}} carpetbagger. Kennedy responded to these charges in a televised town meeting by saying, [...] "If the senator {{of the state of}} New York is going be selected on who's lived here the longest, then I think people are going vote for my opponent. <b>If</b> <b>it's</b> going be selected on who's got the best New York accent, then I think I'm probably out too. But I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>it's</b> going be {{selected on the basis of}} who can make the best United States senator, I think I'm still in the contest." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Assingham hesitated; then, {{blinking}} a little, {{she took}} her risk. [...] "You didn't <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> {{was a question of}} anyone's returning to him, in his trouble, it would be better you yourself should have gone?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, George," [...] {{said the}} Squire, [...] "I <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> {{can be managed}} I shall borrow the money and take the farm on hand. I {{am not going to}} let Janter have it at five shillings an acre." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I shall <b>think.</b> <b>If</b> <b>it</b> is my duty, I suppose God {{will help}} me. Hitherto, I have thought my rage against the brutes {{made it worse}} for her, and that I do best for her by keeping out of the way." ...|$|E
60|$|But if the Crystal Palace vanishes {{from the}} face of the earth, who shall trust any more in castles? Will they really pull it down, do you <b>think?</b> <b>If</b> <b>it's</b> a bubble, it's a glass bubble, and not meant, therefore, for {{bursting}} in the air, it seems to me. And you do want a place in England for sculpture, and also to show people how olives grow. What a beautiful winter garden it would be! But they will pull it down, perhaps; and then, the last we shall have seen of it will be in this description of your letter, and that's seeing it worthily, too.|$|R

6000|$|... "No," [...] she said, [...] "you {{will sit}} still while I see {{what can be}} found. It will be my part to cook and bake and wait on you. I almost <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were necessary, I could drive a team, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O Anne," [...] she sighed, [...] "if I did {{not love}} you, why should I be so uneasy? I am turned into a coward, dear! <b>Think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were the other way round--if you were quite safe and I was in, O, such danger!" ...|$|E

60|$|She {{seemed to}} <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> were put {{back into its}} home it would go on living and singing. I don't know why this should have moved me as it did, but it blurred my eyes for a moment. My little {{daughter}} was {{face to face with}} the great mystery.|$|R

6000|$|... "Of course," [...] he {{said after}} a moment, [...] "it strikes you. Of course it strikes me. Of course what's in store for me may be no more than that.

6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} there is any call for a scene," [...] said Mrs. March firmly. [...] "The poor woman has just got here, and she thinks she has got home. She might as well <b>think</b> so <b>if</b> <b>it</b> is of any comfort to her. You'd better leave her here." ...|$|R
