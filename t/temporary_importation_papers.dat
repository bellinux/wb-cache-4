40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that skilled immigrants create less assimilation problems and are more desirable in modern knowledge-based economies than unskilled immigrants. Whereas unskilled workers migrating on a permanent basis into major countries of immigration (unlike the <b>temporary</b> <b>importation</b> of workers legally under the gastarbeiter programs of postwar Europe or the Bracero program of the United States for agricultural workers) are typically entering illegally, or have entered legally and stayed on illegally, the entry of skilled workers therefore has been through legal mechanisms. Equally, international migration of the skilled from the developing to the developed countries is increasingly {{a feature of the}} legal-immigration systems of many developed countries. The resulting focus on skilled migration raises a host of questions, for both “receiving” and “sending” countries, many of which are addressed in this volume.

40|$|I ask {{generally}} {{whether a}} country {{can benefit from}} the <b>temporary</b> <b>importation</b> of human capital, and specifically whether a program that attracts large groups of academic visitors to a distant country benefits it by generating additional scholarly research on local issues.

The matching of the control {{may be viewed as}} being along both observable and (to the researcher) unobservable characteristics of the treated and control individuals. The results show a highly significant ceteris paribus impact of such visits on the visitor's subsequent research.

40|$|Jessica L Berger, Ashlee Smith, Kristin K Zorn, Paniti Sukumvanich, Alexander B Olawaiye, Joseph Kelley, Thomas C Krivak Magee-Womens Hospital, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Pittsburgh, PA, USA Background: In {{response}} to the critical shortage of Doxil®, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed <b>temporary</b> <b>importation</b> of non-FDA-approved second-generation liposomal doxorubicin, Lipo-Dox®. Lipo-Dox utilizes a different liposomal particle than Doxil and demonstrates different pharmacokinetic properties. Its use has never been evaluated in a North American population. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Lipo-Dox at Magee-Womens Hospital, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, for patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer who were treated during the Doxil shortage. Methods: Patients treated with Lipo-Dox from January 2012 to December 2012 were identified retrospectively. Disease response was defined radiographically by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) or biochemically by CA- 125 level if measurable disease was not present. Survival was defined from the start date of Lipo-Dox until the date of progression or death. Toxicity was assessed by the Gynecologic Oncology Group common toxicity criteria. Results: Eighteen patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer who received Lipo-Dox were identified. These patients had a median of three prior treatment regimens. The median number of Lipo-Dox cycles given was 3. 5 (range 1 – 8). No patients had a complete or partial response. Two patients had stable disease over a mean follow-up of 144. 5 days. Fourteen patients had progressive disease, with a median time to progression of 82 days. Progression was based on CA- 125 in four patients and RECIST in the remainder. Nine patients died from the disease. Conclusion: Although this represents a small, pretreated population, there were no clinical responses to Lipo-Dox, raising the question as to whether it is an equivalent substitute for Doxil. Further evaluation is needed, but if confirmed, these findings raise concerns regarding the use of current stocks of Lipo-Dox, as well as the prudence of managing future drug shortages with pharmacologically similar, but clinically untested drugs.

40|$|The book {{structural}} Heterogeneity, technological asymmetries {{and growth}} in Latin America permitted {{the publication of}} five guided studies to describe and examining principal mechanisms that explain the patterns of structural change at the region, origins of structural heterogeneity and the relation that exists among the same ones and the economic growth. The first study analyzes {{the changes in the}} structure of job and also evidences that the problems of heterogeneity tend to get worse in the region and moreover, they derive of weakness of the weight of the technologically-more-dynamic sectors in the productive structure and in the vector exporter. In second study is presented as referential framework a North-South ricardian model of international commerce, enriched for the contributions of ECLAC and schumpeterian literature. Here, it is analyzed in detail the sources of increase of labor productivity in the industry of the region during the last 30 years and it is demonstrated than even though there are important differences among countries, productivity gains are explained principally by the ones that occur at the same level in each sector, and no for the relocation of the labor force from sectors of low productivity toward the ones with higher productivity. For that reason, heterogeneity does not tend to disappear in the long term. The third study measures the productive heterogeneity in Brazil starting from the dispersion of levels of productivity, among sectors and within each sector. A descriptive analysis at sectorial level is performed, and it is proposed a typology whereon sectors are classified as: leaders, stagnant, rasing or falling-behind; according to their respective performances in terms of the level and of rate of variation of productivity of work. With the help of a conventional technique called "shift and share", it is examined the contributions of the direct, composition and adaptation effects, to the variation of productivity. The fourth study retakes and develops the concept of heterogeneity for the Mexican case. Productive activities are defined according to two distinct sectorial patterns. The first is the global productive activities, which are associated to the specific tariff regimes of the maquila sector (IME) and to the program of <b>temporary</b> <b>importations</b> to produce goods destined to the exporting (PITEX). The fifth study analyzes how the interaction among the dynamic macro, the patterns of commerce and the structural transformation explain the process of development in Costa Rica. It is focused on the effects of foreign direct investments (IED), evaluating the capability to activate the national learning systems and innovation. ...|$|R

A huge proportion of the electronic waste is exported from the industrial countries to developing countries, in order to save costs, and also because of too few recycling plants in industrial countries.

Thereby the burden for the people as well as the environment increases because e-waste includes a lot of toxic substances.

40|$|Providing {{adequate}} {{water supplies}} of good quality {{is becoming a}} serious problem {{in many areas of}} the United States. Some of the alternatives proposed for meeting the growing shortage of clean-water or cheap-water are reallocation, reuse, and <b>importation.</b> This <b>paper</b> outlines a methodology to assess all of these water supply alternatives by examining the amount and time-staging for development of water sources. In conceptualizing the problem, sources of supply are classified in three categories: primary or base supplies, secondary or effluent supplies, and supplementary or imported supplies. A model of the water system is formulated as a “transportation problem” in linear programming depicting the possible sources of supply which can be used to satisfy the requirements of various water users. The optimizing objective in the model is to minimize the cost of water under various assumptions for operating the system. A case study of the Salt Lake Qty, Utah, area is used to illustrate the application of the model in obtaining optimal water supply allocations for projected future demands. Assessment of alternatives in the study include redistribution of supplies, time-staging of supplies and related treatment facilities, and sensitivity of allocations to changes in costs...|$|R
