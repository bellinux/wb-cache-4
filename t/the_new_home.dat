5|$|In July 2011, CoMS {{was renamed}} the Etihad Stadium, {{sponsored}} by Etihad Airways who fought off competition from Ferrostaal and Aabar {{to gain the}} stadium naming rights. The lucrative ten-year sponsorship deal included not just the naming rights to the stadium itself but to the whole £200 million complex of football-related facilities into which it was soon to be incorporated. In mid-September 2011, development plans were duly announced for a new state-of-the-art youth academy and training facility, {{now known as the}} City Football Academy (CFA) to be built on derelict land adjacent to the stadium and which would include a 7,000 capacity mini-stadium plus fifteen additional outdoor football pitches, six swimming pools and three gyms. The planned CFA facility was not only to become <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>home</b> base of the Manchester City first team squad, reserve (under-21 youth) team squad, and all of the Academy younger age group squads, but also <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>home</b> of the prior loosely affiliated Manchester City Ladies team (which was re-branded in 2012 as Manchester City Women's F.C. and more formally merged into the Manchester City family of affiliated football teams). Also fully integrated into the new CFA facility would be the parent club's world headquarters.|$|E

50|$|The face of Nechells changed {{dramatically}} during the 1960s, with the decaying Victorian terraces being cleared {{and the area}} redeveloped with new houses and tower blocks. Some families remained in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>homes</b> that had been built around Nechells, but there were insufficient <b>new</b> <b>homes</b> to rehouse all of the area's original residents, {{and as a result}} some families moved to new housing estates like Castle Vale and Chelmsley Wood. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>homes</b> were certainly a big improvement on their predecessors, but the area still suffered from rising unemployment and crime.|$|R

5|$|Things slowly took a {{turn for}} the worse when former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich's {{decision}} to move a division of I-DOT to Southern Illinois was overturned by his successor Pat Quinn.

She underwent a refit at Portsmouth from March to September 1907, during which she received fire control and magazine cooling and had her machinery and boilers overhauled. Her refit completed, Glory commissioned at Portsmouth on 18 September 1907 for service in the Mediterranean Fleet. On 20 April 1909, she paid off at Portsmouth and recommissioned for reserve duty with a nucleus crew in the 4th Division, Home Fleet, at the Nore.

From June 1912 to January 1913 she served as a seagoing gunnery training ship at the Nore. In January 1913 she {{was transferred to the}} 3rd Fleet, and was based at Pembroke Dock and Devonport.|$|E
5|$|The {{service was}} a success, and NSB {{received}} a 112% increase in ridership the first year. This {{resulted in the}} company introducing a similar service between Trondheim and Innherred, the Trøndelag Commuter Rail, in 1993. In 1993, NSB won Statens Byggeskikkpris, among other things for the new sheds on the Jæren Line. By 1995, ridership was up 150% from before the service started. In 1997, NSB announced that they would order 36 new electric multiple units, which would among other things replace the aging trains on the Jæren Commuter Rail. The new Class 72 trains were put into service on 8 August 2002, several years behind schedule. In April 2004, the rail administration opened Jåttå Station, which was located close to Viking Stadion, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>home</b> ground of Tippeligaen side Viking FK.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1970s plans {{continued}} to emerge for the redevelopment of the Albert Dock {{site and the}} whole of the south docks system in general. Many of these plans were quite extreme including Liverpool City Council's suggestion to use the dock basin as a landfill site. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt it could get more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not derelict land. One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously was the idea that it become <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>home</b> of Liverpool Polytechnic (now John Moores University). The government was even willing to provide £3m in funding but like so many other plans this too fell by the wayside.|$|E

5|$|At {{the urging}} of both Yeesha and Esher, the player travels across four Ages, {{collecting}} four slates that unlock the tablet's power. Esher occasionally appears in the Ages to offer his counsel, or reveal the histories of his people and the worlds the player explores. Once all four slates are collected, Esher requests that the player bring the tablet {{to him in the}} now-unlocked Age of Myst. The player is then returned to K'veer, where they have four possible choices. Travelling to Myst without the tablet will cause Esher to angrily abandon the player with no way out. If Esher is given the tablet, he will explain he wishes to use the tablet for domination, and will also leave the player trapped. If the player gives the tablet to Yeesha, the tablet simply slips through her hands and disappears into the ground; she walks away, disappointed, leaving the player trapped in D'ni. The only good ending involves giving the Bahro the tablet, ending their enslavement. Arriving at Releeshahn, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>home</b> Age of the D'ni, Yeesha and Atrus thank the player and speak of a new chapter for the D'ni people; Esher is handed over to the Bahro to be punished for his crimes. The game ends on a visit to Releeshahn.|$|E
5|$|The road opener was {{the first}} game ever played in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>home</b> stadium of the UCF Knights. McCoy's 47 passing {{attempts}} tied a Texas single-game record. His 32 completions set a new school record, besting the 30 completed by Vince Young during the 2006 Rose Bowl and by Major Applewhite during two 1999 games. The final non-conference game was against Rice, and McCoy completed 20 of his 29 passing attempts, accumulating 333 yards through the air. For {{the first time in}} the season, he did not throw an interception. McCoy and most of the Longhorn starting players were replaced by backups after the first drive of the second half. True freshman quarterback John Chiles made his first college appearance in the first quarter. He came onto the field beside McCoy and then McCoy trotted out to a slot receiver position. Chiles never looked to pass; he ran up the middle for no gain. He came out of the game after that play and came back in the third quarter as McCoy's replacement. On that drive, Chiles line up in the zone-read offense and led the Longhorns 80 yards to a touchdown, carrying the ball four times for 49 yards. Chiles' strong performance immediately led to media speculation as to how much playing time he will take from McCoy.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2008, several {{redevelopment}} {{projects in the}} downtown area, some {{of which had been}} discussed for decades, were put into motion and resulted in nearly $110 million in total investment from public and private sources. The first of these was the Phoenix Project, a development privately financed by Kent resident Ron Burbick that renovated and expanded a section of commercial space along East Main Street. Included in the project was construction of a pedestrian alleyway lined with small shops, eventually known as Acorn Alley, which opened in 2009. A second phase of Acorn Alley opened the next year. Other aspects of the redevelopment, which include a 360-space parking deck and bus transfer station, a hotel and conference center, and three separate mixed-use buildings, began to take shape in 2010 following the demolition of several buildings in a four block area. New offices for Ametek and the Davey Tree Expert Company opened in late 2012 along with several new small businesses on the first floors of each building. The hotel, operated by Kent State University, opened in June 2013 and the new parking garage, operated by the Portage Area Regional Transportation Authority (PARTA) opened April 30, 2013, as the Kent Central Gateway. In addition to parking, the facility functions as PARTA's main bus transfer station and has storefronts on the ground level facing East Erie Street. Included in the redevelopment was the purchase and renovation of the old Kent hotel, which first opened in 1920. After being mostly vacant since 1979 and completely vacant since 2000, it re-opened on April 1, 2013, as <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>home</b> to the Kent location of Buffalo Wild Wings and also houses offices, a wine and jazz bar, and apartments. A five-story mixed-use building called The Landmark was completed in 2014 and construction started in November 2015 on an additional five-story mixed-use building featuring microapartments, scheduled to be completed in 2016. The developments attracted the attention of The Plain Dealer and The New York Times and earned the city and university the 2013 Larry Abernathy Award from the International Town–Gown Association in recognition of the positive town–gown cooperation and collaboration.|$|E
