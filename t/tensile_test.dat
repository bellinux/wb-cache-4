[...] Uniaxial tests do not provide lateral restraint during testing and thus tests the sample under uniaxial stress conditions.

50|$|Most widely <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> {{method is}} used to {{characterize}} the mechanical properties of materials. From any complete <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> record, one can obtain important informations about the material’s elastic properties, the character and extent of plastic deformation, yield and tensile strengths and toughness. These informations which {{can be obtained from}} one test justifies the extensive use of <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> in engineering materials research. Therefore, investigations of EMR emissions are mainly based on the <b>tensile</b> <b>test</b> of the specimens.From experiments, it can be shown that tensile crack formation excites more intensive EMR than shear cracking, increasing the elasticity, strength and loading rate during uniaxial loading increases amplitude. Poissons ratio is a key parameter for EMR characterization during triaxial compression. If the poissions ratio is lower, it is harder for the material to strain transversally and hence higher is the probability of new fractures. Mechanism of plastic deformation is very important for safe operation of any component under dynamic conditions.|$|E
