5|$|In July 1997 the Provisional IRA {{called a}} ceasefire. On 10 October 1997 a Provisional IRA General Army Convention {{was held in}} Falcarragh, County Donegal. At the convention, Provisional IRA Quartermaster General Michael McKevitt—also {{a member of the}} 12-person Provisional IRA Executive—denounced <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>and</b> {{called for an end to}} the group's ceasefire and to its {{participation}} in the Northern Ireland peace process. He was backed by his partner and fellow Executive member Bernadette Sands McKevitt. The two dissidents were outmanoeuvred by <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>and</b> were left isolated. The convention backed the pro-ceasefire line, and on 26 October McKevitt and Sands McKevitt resigned from the Executive along with other members.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to explore the {{perceptions}} of the Solomon Island school leaders on the value of <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> training <b>and</b> development programme which they completed. A qualitative research design was employed for the study. Interviews were conducted with the participants who attended <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> training <b>and</b> development program to gather data needed for the study. Analysis of the data showed that prior to <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> training <b>and</b> development program the school leaders faced a lot of challenges in leading their schools because they possessed limited knowledge <b>and</b> skills on <b>leadership.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, the analysis of the data showed that <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> training <b>and</b> development program has contributed positively in meeting the myriad demands of work expected of them. The findings of the study have implications to the performances, in turn, productivity of those school leaders who have not gone through <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> training <b>and</b> development program. Added to that the findings have implications for the much needed support for school leaders especially the need to mount <b>leadership</b> training <b>and</b> development programs for them to improve their knowledge, skills, attitude, beliefs and values in order to enhance school’s overall performance...|$|R
5|$|Following further {{speculation}} {{over her}} leadership, on 26 June a rumour emerged that supporters of Kevin Rudd were collecting signatures for a letter demanding an immediate leadership vote. That afternoon, before any letter had been published, Gillard called a leadership spill live on television. She challenged any would-be opponent {{to join her}} in a pledge that, while the winner would become leader, the loser would immediately retire from politics. Despite his earlier comments {{that he would not}} return to the leadership under any circumstances, Kevin Rudd announced that he would challenge Gillard for <b>the</b> <b>leadership,</b> <b>and</b> committed to retiring from politics if he lost. In the party-room ballot later that evening, Rudd defeated Gillard by a margin of 57 votes to 45.|$|E
5|$|For {{several weeks}} Lamason {{negotiated}} with the camp authorities to have the airmen transferred to a POW camp, but his requests were denied. At great risk, Lamason secretly got word to the Luftwaffe of the Allied airmen's captivity and, seven days before their scheduled execution, 156 of the 168 prisoners were transferred to Stalag Luft III. Most of the airmen credit their survival at Buchenwald to <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>and</b> determination of Lamason. After the war, he moved to Dannevirke and became a farmer until his retirement. During the 1980s and 1990s, he was a regular speaker at KLB Club and POW reunions.|$|E

5|$|In 1847 a small {{political}} crisis occurred which removed Bentinck from <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>and</b> highlighted Disraeli's differences {{with his own}} party. In that year's general election, Lionel de Rothschild had been returned for the City of London. As a practising Jew he could not take the oath of allegiance in the prescribed Christian form, and therefore could not take his seat. Lord John Russell, the Whig leader who had succeeded Peel as Prime Minister and like Rothschild was a member for the City of London, proposed in the Commons that the oath should be amended to permit Jews to enter Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In April 1943, the German {{leadership}} began {{preparing for}} Operation Citadel, {{with the objective}} of enveloping and destroying the Soviet forces in the Kursk salient, by attacking and breaking through the base of the salient from north and south simultaneously. The German offensive was delayed several times due to the vacillation of <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>and</b> the addition of more forces and new equipment. The Soviet high command, Stavka, had learned of the German intentions, and therefore used the delay to prepare a series of defensive belts along the routes of the planned German offensive. The Soviet leadership also massed several armies deep behind their defences as the Stavka Reserve. This army group, the Steppe Front, was to launch counteroffensives once the German strength had dissipated. The 5th Guards Tank Army was the primary armoured formation of the Steppe Front.|$|E
5|$|In the Politburo Podgorny {{could count}} on the support of Gennady Voronov and Petro Shelest. Podgorny was {{constantly}} in conflict with Kosygin over policy issues in the Politburo. When Podgorny and Kosygin actually agreed on something Brezhnev would find himself in the minority, and forced to follow their decisions. However, Podgorny was pleased about his position within <b>the</b> <b>leadership,</b> <b>and</b> even more pleased by the extension of powers given to the Supreme Soviet. As head of state, Podgorny saw little threat to his position, even if a Central Committee resolution from 1971 had called {{for the expansion of}} Party activities in the Soviets.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the debate Bentinck resigned <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>and</b> was succeeded by Lord Granby; Disraeli's own speech, thought by many of his own party to be blasphemous, ruled him out for the time being. While these intrigues played out, Disraeli was working with the Bentinck family to secure the necessary financing to purchase Hughenden Manor, in Buckinghamshire. The possession of a country house, and incumbency of a county constituency were regarded as essential for a Tory with ambitions to lead the party. Disraeli and his wife alternated between Hughenden and several homes in London {{for the rest of their}} marriage. The negotiations were complicated by Bentinck's sudden death on 21 September 1848, but Disraeli obtained a loan of £25,000 from Bentinck's brothers Lord Henry Bentinck and Lord Titchfield.|$|E
5|$|On December 22, 2010, {{cabinet ministers}} Jerome Kennedy and Darin King, who were both seen as likely {{leadership}} candidates, announced {{they would not}} seek {{the leadership of the}} party. Both men said they were encouraging Dunderdale to run and that they would endorse her campaign if she entered the race. On December 23, 2010, Dunderdale garnered support from two other cabinet ministers when Finance Minister Tom Marshall and Municipal Affairs Minister Kevin O'Brien opted out of running for <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>and</b> threw their support behind her entering the race.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{minutes before}} the ballot was due to occur, Rudd {{publicly}} {{announced that he would}} not contest the leadership, in line with the commitment he had made following the 2012 contest. As such, Gillard and Wayne Swan were the only candidates for <b>the</b> <b>Leadership</b> <b>and</b> Deputy Leadership of the Labor Party, and were elected unopposed. This marked {{the first time in history}} that an incumbent Labor Leader was elected unopposed at a leadership ballot. Several ministers subsequently resigned from the government, including Chief Government Whip Joel Fitzgibbon, Human Services Minister Kim Carr, and Energy Minister Martin Ferguson.|$|E

5|$|The last-ditched {{effort by}} the Germans {{to win the war}} came to a {{grinding}} halt in mid-July and after that there followed a brief period of lull, during which time the Australians undertook a series of small unit actions aimed at capturing parts of the German line with limited support. These actions became known as Peaceful Penetrations and were essentially a cross between trench raids and patrolling. Their success relied heavily upon <b>the</b> <b>leadership</b> <b>and</b> initiative of junior commanders and the ability of soldiers to employ principles of fire and manouevre. This lull did not last long, however, as the Allies were soon ready to launch their own offensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, which would ultimately bring about an end to the war.|$|E
5|$|Whitlam {{appointed}} Senator Murphy to the High Court, {{even though}} Murphy's Senate seat {{would not be}} up for election if a half-Senate election were held. Labor then held {{three of the five}} short-term New South Wales Senate seats. Under proportional representation, Labor could hold its three short-term seats in the next half-Senate election but, if Murphy's seat were also contested, Labor was unlikely to win four out of six. Thus, a Murphy appointment meant the almost certain loss of a seat in the closely divided Senate at the next election. Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway. By convention, senators appointed by the state legislature to fill casual vacancies were from the same political party as the former senator. The New South Wales premier, Tom Lewis felt that this convention only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health, and arranged for the legislature to elect Cleaver Bunton, former mayor of Albury and an independent. By March 1975, many Liberal parliamentarians felt that Snedden was doing an inadequate job as leader of the Opposition, and that Whitlam was dominating him in the House of Representatives. Malcolm Fraser challenged Snedden for <b>the</b> <b>leadership,</b> <b>and</b> defeated him on 21 March.|$|E
