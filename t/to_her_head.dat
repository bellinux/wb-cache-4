5|$|In 1999 Patel was reprimanded by the General Medical Council (GMC) {{for having}} {{released}} medical details about Roger Sylvester, {{a man who}} had died in police custody. In 2002 the police dropped a criminal inquiry because Patel said the victim, Sally White, had {{died of a heart attack}} with no signs of violence, although she was reportedly found naked with bruising to her body, an injury <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and a bite mark on her thigh. Anthony Hardy, a mentally ill alcoholic who lived in the flat in which her body was found locked in a bedroom, later murdered two women and placed their body parts in bin bags. The police investigated Patel in relation to that autopsy, but the investigation was dropped.|$|E

5|$|Many {{of those}} killed were tortured, beaten using chains and burned. Most {{of the victims were}} killed by gunshots, but the cause of death proved hard to {{establish}} for eight victims whose bodies were severely burned. A couple was bound with chains and burned alive, two women were killed using axes or similar sharp objects, one of them by several axe blows <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Another couple was beheaded and their heads were placed in bags. One victim was cut by a chain saw while still alive, and another died trapped in her house which was torched by the paramilitaries. The Serb civilian who attempted to protect the others was also beaten, tortured using lighted cigarettes and heated chains, and then flayed.|$|E

5000|$|Like most Worlds of Wonder toys, such as Teddy and Mickey, Mother Goose used specially-coded {{cassettes}} and 4 [...] "C" [...] batteries to operate. Mother Goose {{moved her}} eyes, beak, and, {{unlike most of}} the toys, Mother Goose was able <b>to</b> move <b>her</b> <b>head</b> from side-to-side. Both versions moved her eyes and beak, but only the early first version was able <b>to</b> move <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 2010, police {{raided the}} {{apartment}} of Rickia Russell looking for illegal drugs. While Russell was eating dinner with her boyfriend, police threw a flashbang grenade after breaching the door. The exploding flashbang gave Russell third degree burns on both calves, and burns <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> The contraband the squad was looking for was {{not found in the}} apartment, and the Minneapolis City Council agreed to pay $1 million in damages.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as the}} men are gone, the fairies {{change their}} attitudes, as if awaking from a dream. With the mortals now gone from their midst, the chastened fairies admit that they have all sinned. The fairy Ethais arrives {{with the news that}} fairies, like mortals, can love. But Selene warns that love is a deadly snare. The chorus praise Selene's purity, and Darine returns the crown <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> The fairies kneel in adoration at her feet.|$|E
25|$|On 20 February 2014, Grieveson {{was also}} arrested on {{suspicion}} of the 1992 murder of a seven-year-old girl named Nikki Allan, who had been found stabbed {{to death in a}} disused warehouse in October, 1992. Although Allan was female, the injuries inflicted <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> had been similar to those Grieveson had earlier inflicted on Simon Martin in 1990. Grieveson was questioned as to his potential involvement, although detectives later stated he (Grieveson) faced no further current action.|$|E

25|$|At the pier, Meg {{prepares to}} drown Gustave, who cannot swim, when the others arrive to confront her. She reveals to the Phantom that the {{resources}} Madame Giry has afforded him came from Meg's {{working as a}} prostitute to influential men. She expresses her hurt and resentment that the Phantom never took any notice of her or appreciated her singing and dancing. After sharing her feelings, Meg decides to let Gustave live and releases him. She produces a gun and holds it <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> intent on ending her misery. The Phantom tries to apologise and console her, but when he unthinkingly mentions Christine's name, Meg becomes agitated once again. When the Phantom tries to take the gun from her, Meg accidentally shoots Christine ("Please Miss Giry, I Want To Go Back").|$|E
25|$|On 5 October 2009, a {{motorway}} worker found {{a plastic}} bin bag containing bones {{while he was}} clearing a vegetation patch on a slip road at Junction 14 of the M5 motorway. The bones in the bag included a skull, pelvis and thigh bone and further remains were found buried and spread around the field {{by the side of}} the motorway. Police confirmed that the remains were human, and they showed a piece of jewellery found at the site to Mr and Mrs Hall, who confirmed that it had belonged to their daughter. Despite this, police refused to confirm that the body was that of Miss Hall until a post-mortem had been carried out. The remains were formally identified as being Hall's through dental records on 7 October. She had incurred severe blunt trauma <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> during her ordeal, resulting in a fractured skull, cheekbone and jaw. Hall had also been tied up with a thin blue rope.|$|E
25|$|On August 11, 1990, a woman {{threw her}} four-month-old {{daughter}} onto {{the tracks of}} the park's monorail. The baby supposedly fell at least eight feet. The event occurred {{at one of the}} monorail's loading stations located at the Anheuser-Busch Hospitality Center. A monorail operator spotted the baby and immediately shut off the power. Although the baby did have extensive injuries <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> she ultimately recovered. The mother was in an altercation with the baby's father when the baby was reportedly tossed over a fence and into the path of the monorail. Although the mother stated that the baby slipped out of her arms, that claim was dismissed due to the height of the fence. A source stated that the mother confessed to throwing her baby girl onto the tracks in order to prove to the baby's father that it was her baby and she could have done whatever she wanted to her. Both the father and mother were charged with child endangerment.|$|E

25|$|Himani Singh {{is played}} by Gurdeep Punj. She is Avatar's wife {{and the mother of}} Rohan, Dolly, Sunny, Nikki, and Bobby. She works as a {{hospital}} nurse and is often portrayed as dutiful, protective, and comedic. She loves her family and does everything to care for and protect them. She appears out of her element when she isn't nurturing them, especially Nikki, but as the series progresses, she begins to feel assured that her youngest children are in good hands and trusts that her husband and three elder children can look after Nikki and Bobby. She is notoriously conceited and enjoys bragging about her accomplishments, be they admirable, real, or otherwise. Himani used to work on the local news team and was also a poet in her high-school days. A running gag on the show is that she was involved in virtually every extracurricular activity at Arya College of Arts and Science, but still earned a nursing degree. She lets special opportunities go <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> such as being on TV or singing in front of a group. She has a habit of taking any chance at publicity that may shine on her family to focus on her, but this never works out well; usually she ends up being cut from the project or tossed out of certain groups. Himani seldom accepts her children's misbehavior. It is revealed in the third special that she is pregnant again with her fifth child. In the middle of the third season, Himani quit her nursing job to be a stay-at-home mother to Nikki and Bobby. Himani is the equivalent of Amy Duncan in Good Luck Charlie, who {{is played by}} Leigh-Allyn Baker.|$|E
500|$|An autopsy {{ruled that}} Flores {{did not have}} sexual {{intercourse}} before her death {{and that she was}} not under the influence of enough alcohol to prevent her from resisting an attack. She suffered blunt force trauma <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> which caused a brain hemorrhage, cranial fracture, and broken neck. She also suffered significant injuries to her face and showed signs of asphyxiation, according to court documents. Flores tested positive for the presence of amphetamines. The lab report does not indicate whether the victim took the drugs willingly or unknowingly.|$|E
500|$|The {{prosecution}} {{case was}} that Tabak had strangled Yeates at her flat {{within minutes of}} her arrival home on 17 December 2010, using [...] "sufficient force" [...] to kill her. The prosecutors stated that Tabak – around a foot (30cm) taller than Yeates – had used his height and build to overpower her, pinning her to the floor by the wrists, {{and that she had}} suffered 43 separate injuries <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> neck, torso and arms during the struggle. The injuries included cuts, bruises, and a fractured nose. Lickley told the court that the struggle was lengthy, and her death would have been slow and painful. However, he did not offer an explanation for the reasoning behind Tabak's initial attack on Yeates.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the release, Gaga {{unveiled}} three cover artworks, {{which were}} photographed by Steven Klein. The first one shows Gaga naked with a scorpion balanced {{on her head}} inspired by performance artist Marina Abramović. In the second image, the singer stands naked with a kebab in her mouth, while the third shows a dead bat laying flat on its back. A writer for Rap-Up called the artworks [...] "striking", while Metro commented that the covers were only more [...] "photo of Lady Gaga doing something weird." [...] John Walker from MTV News {{found it difficult to}} understand the meaning behind the artworks, but nevertheless found them compelling. When the song debuted on YouTube, yet another picture was used to accompany the audio showing Gaga in metallic paint with a scorpion attached <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
500|$|Maria's face is {{idealised}} and {{conforms to}} contemporary ideals of beauty, {{especially in the}} raised eyebrows and elongated nose. The art historian Lorne Campbell has noted her facial similarity to the Virgin in Memling's panel at the National Museum of Ancient Art, Lisbon. In this work, Maria's frame is slightly undersized compared <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> a common characteristic of contemporary northern portraiture, also found in similar works by Rogier van der Weyden and Petrus Christus. Her elbows rest on an unseen parapet that coincides with the lower edge of the painted stone [...] frame, acting as a trompe-l'œil which situates her both in the same reality and in closer proximity to the viewer. Maria wears a relatively modest wedding band lined with rubies and sapphire. Her necklace is colored with mostly red and blue jewels, similar to Hugo van der Goes's portrait {{of her in the}} Portinari Altarpiece.|$|E
500|$|According to Sánchez, on Friday, November 6, 2009, she {{and three}} others were taken in her own {{neighborhood}} by men working for the Cuban government. She {{said that she was}} heading to an anti-violence demonstration and was forcefully put into a car along with another Cuban blogger, Orlando Luis Pardo Lazo (she stated that the other two were placed into another car). She characterizes the event on her blog, Generation Y, as a [...] "kidnapping" [...] and describes the event in detail. [...] Sánchez said that when she was accosted on the street, [...] "The curious crowded around and I shouted, 'Help, these men want to kidnap us,' but they stopped those who wanted to intervene with a shout that revealed the whole ideological background of the operation, 'Don’t mess with it, these are counterrevolutionaries.'" [...] Sánchez said that she was put into the backseat of the car and received blows <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> legs and buttocks as she was pinned down. [...] The incident was condemned by the U.S. administration and by Human Rights Watch.|$|E
