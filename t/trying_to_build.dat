5|$|Pilot Gerhard Goebel {{was able}} to calm Demeke down during the {{non-stop}} flight to New York.

Goebel later told newspapers that he spent the hours <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a rapport with Demeke, who admitted to having spent several months planning the hijacking. Both men agreed that, upon arriving in New York, Goebel would give Demeke his sunglasses in exchange for Demeke's pistol.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, even single neurons {{appear to}} be complex and capable of {{performing}} computations. So, brain models that don't reflect this are too abstract to be representative of brain operation; models that do try to capture this are very computationally expensive and arguably intractable with present computational resources. However, the Human Brain Project is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a realistic, detailed computational model of the entire human brain. The wisdom of this approach has been publicly contested, with high-profile scientists {{on both sides of}} the argument.|$|E

25|$|While thought-capable {{artificial}} beings {{appeared as}} storytelling devices in antiquity, {{the idea of}} actually <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a machine to perform useful reasoning may have begun with Ramon Llull (c. 1300 CE).

Since the 19th century, artificial beings are common in fiction, as in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein or Karel Čapek's R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots).|$|E
