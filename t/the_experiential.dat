Sunyata, {{the true nature of}} reality, or the emptiness of inherent existence of all things, is propounded according to a typical Tibetan classification of four classical Indian schools of philosophical tenets. While the classical tenets-system, as propagated by the Gelugpa, is limited to four tenets (Vaibhāṣika, Sautrāntika, Yogācāra, and Madhyamaka), more complicated systems include also the shentong-view of the Jonang and the Kagyu, and also differentiates between the radical emptiness of the Gelugpa-school, and <b>the</b> <b>experiential</b> emptiness of the Nyingma and the Shakya.|$|E

25|$|Kagyu(pa), Oral Lineage. This {{contains}} {{one major}} subsect and one minor subsect. The first, the Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to Gampopa. In turn, the Dagpo Kagyu {{consists of four}} major sub-sects: the Karma Kagyu, headed by a Karmapa, the Tsalpa Kagyu, the Barom Kagyu, and Pagtru Kagyu. The once-obscure Shangpa Kagyu, which was famously represented by the 20th-century teacher Kalu Rinpoche, traces its history back to the Indian master Niguma, sister of Kagyu lineage holder Naropa. This is an oral tradition which is very much concerned with <b>the</b> <b>experiential</b> dimension of meditation. Its most famous exponent was Milarepa, an 11th-century mystic.|$|E
25|$|Some questionnaires, {{such as the}} Religious Orientation Scale, {{relate to}} {{different}} religious orientations, such as intrinsic and extrinsic religiousness, referring to different motivations for religious allegiance. A rather different approach, taken, for example, by Glock and Stark (1965), has been to list different dimensions of religion rather than different religious orientations, which relates to how an individual may manifest different forms of being religious. Glock and Stark's famous typology described five dimensions of religion – the doctrinal, the intellectual, the ethical-consequential, the ritual, and <b>the</b> <b>experiential.</b> In later work these authors subdivided the ritual dimension into devotional and public ritual, and also clarified that their distinction of religion along multiple dimensions was not identical to distinguishing religious orientations. Although some psychologists of religion have found it helpful to take a multidimensional approach to religion {{for the purpose of}} psychometric scale design, there has been, as Wulff (1997) explains, considerable controversy about whether religion should really be seen as multidimensional.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{holistic}} planned grazing {{began in}} the 1960s when Allan Savory, a wildlife biologist in his native Southern Rhodesia, set out to understand desertification. This {{can be seen in}} the context of the larger environmental movement. Heavily influenced by the work of André Voisin and the ineffectiveness of mainstream rangeland science of the time, Savory concluded that the spread of deserts, the loss of wildlife, and the human impoverishment that always resulted were related to the reduction of the natural herds of large grazers and even more, the change in behavior of those few remaining herds. Livestock could be substituted to provide important ecosystem services like nutrient cycling when mimicking those uniquely coevolved grasses and grazers. But managers had found that while rotational grazing systems can work for diverse management purposes, scientific experiments had demonstrated that they do not necessarily work for specific ecological purposes. An adaptive management plan was needed for the integration of <b>the</b> <b>experiential</b> with the experimental, as well as the social with the biophysical, to provide a more comprehensive framework for the management of rangeland systems. None of these sources of knowledge could be understood except in the context of the whole. Holistic management was developed to meet that need.|$|E
40|$|Boredom is {{a common}} {{experience}} that affects people on multiple levels, including their thoughts, feelings, motivations, and actions. Not much research, however, has examined what makes the experience of boredom distinct from other affective experiences. Based on earlier research on boredom and our meaning-regulation framework, we {{conducted a series of}} four studies that demonstrate <b>the</b> distinct <b>experiential</b> content of boredom. More than other negative affective experiences (sadness, anger, and frustration), boredom makes people feel unchallenged while they think that the situation and their actions are meaningless (Study 1). <b>The</b> distinct <b>experiential</b> content of boredom is associated with boredom proneness (Study 2) and with state boredom experiences (Study 3).

Perennialists regard those various experience traditions as pointing to one universal transcendental reality, for which those experiences offer the proof.

2500|$|At first glance, Schiller appears {{very similar}} to James. However, Schiller’s more {{stringent}} requirement that meaningful statements have consequences [...] "to some one for some purpose" [...] makes Schiller’s position more extreme than James’. For Schiller, {{it is not a}} sufficient condition for meaningfulness that a statement entail experiential consequences (as it is for both Peirce and James). Schiller requires that the consequences of a statement make the statement relevant to some particular person’s goals at a specific moment in time {{if it is to be}} meaningful. Therefore, it is not simply enough that the statement [...] "diamonds are hard" [...] and the statement [...] "diamonds are soft" [...] entail different experiential consequences, it is also required that <b>the</b> <b>experiential</b> difference makes a difference to someone’s purposes. Only then, and only to that person, do the two statements state something different. If <b>the</b> <b>experiential</b> difference between hard and soft diamonds did not connect up with my purpose for entering into thought, the two statements would possess the same meaning. For example, if I were to randomly blurt out [...] "diamonds are hard" [...] and then [...] "diamonds are soft" [...] to everyone in a coffee shop one day, my words would mean nothing. Words can only mean something if they are stated with a specific purpose.|$|E
