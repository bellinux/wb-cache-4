40|$|Background: As life {{expectancy}} gets higher, the demand {{of health services}} for elderly starts to grow. Flexibility worsens as one grows older, while Senam Sehat Indonesia (SSI) is an easy exercise for elderly to promote joint flexibility. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare flexibility of low back and hips, knees and also ankles between SSI-exercising and non SSI-exercising elderly women. Methods: This cross-sectional study took place at three elderly nursing homes in Semarang and Ungaran. Subjects were 60 -year-old women and over. Primary data was taken from the measurement of toe <b>touching</b> <b>test</b> and range of motion (ROM) of knee and ankle using universal goniometer. Data was analyzed with ANCOVA test which compares flexibilities between SSI-exercising and non SSI-exercising subjects by including age and Body Mass Index in the analysis using SPSS 15. 0 for windows. Results: Mean results of SSI-exercising subjects, which are - 3. 4 ± 7. 61 cm for toe <b>touching</b> <b>test,</b> 130. 3 ± 8. 34 o for ROM of knee and 62. 3 ± 17. 20 o for ROM of ankle, are all higher than those of non SSI-exercising subjects, which are consecutively, - 7. 0 ± 11. 39 cm, 122. 8 ± 12. 42 o and 57. 8 ± 15. 21 o. ANCOVA test results are not significantly different for toe <b>touching</b> <b>test</b> (p= 0. 610), but they are for ROM of knee and ankle (consecutively p= 0. 000 and p= 0. 003). Conclusion: Knee and ankle flexibilities of SSI-exercising elderly women are significantly higher than those of non SSI-exercising. Toe <b>touching</b> <b>test</b> results are better in the SSI-exercising elderly women, though not significantly different. Keywords: flexibility, Senam Sehat Indonesia, elderly, women...|$|E
40|$|In the Welfare Quality ® {{assessment}} {{protocol for}} broilers, the <b>touch</b> <b>test</b> is included {{to assess the}} human–animal relationship in the flock. The test is designed to measure the animals’ fear of humans, assuming that broilers will withdraw from the observer if they are fearful. However, many broilers close to slaughter age have impaired walking ability, and {{the results from the}} <b>touch</b> <b>test</b> may thus be biased by lameness and poor leg health. As the <b>touch</b> <b>test</b> is currently being used in several countries to assess human–animal relationship in broilers, there is an urgent need to examine this potential relationship for a further validation of the test. In the present study, fear of humans was assessed in 50 randomly selected Norwegian broiler flocks, using the <b>touch</b> <b>test</b> as described in the Welfare Quality ® protocol for ty broilers. Leg health was assessed by examining the gait of 150 random birds in each of the flocks, using a six-point gait score scale from 0 to 5. The coefficient for the relationship between <b>touch</b> <b>test</b> score and gait score was 0. 034 (P< 0. 001), indicating that the animals express less fear as assessed by the <b>touch</b> <b>test</b> when the gait scores increase. This implies that the <b>touch</b> <b>test</b> may be confounded by impaired walking ability and therefore might be a suboptimal method of assessing fear of humans and human–animal relationship in broilers. In conclusion, the results from this study suggests that the <b>touch</b> <b>test</b> must be further validated in broilers and perhaps be replaced with a fear test that doesn’t rely on walking ability. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to 1) identify determinants of poor welfare in commercial broiler chicken flocks by studying the associations between selected resource-based measures (RBM, potential risk factors), such as litter quality and dark period, and animal-based welfare indicators (ABM), such as foot pad dermatitis and lameness, and 2) establish the breadth of effect of a risk factor by determining the range of animal welfare indicators associated with each of the risk factors (i. e., the number of ABM related to a specific RBM). Eighty-nine broiler flocks were inspected in 4 European countries (France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands) in a cross-sectional study. The ABM were contact dermatitis (measured using scores of foot-pad dermatitis and hock burn, respectively), lameness (measured as gait score), fear of humans (measured by the avoidance distance <b>test</b> and the <b>touch</b> <b>test),</b> and negative emotional state (measured using qualitative behavior assessment, QBA). In a first step, risk factors were identified by building a multiple linear regression model for each ABM. Litter quality was identified as a risk factor for contact dermatitis. Length of dark period at 3 wk old (DARK 3) was a risk factor for the <b>touch</b> <b>test</b> result. DARK 3 and flock age were risk factors for lameness, and the number of different stockmen and DARK 3 were risk factors for QBA results. Next, the ABM were grouped according to risk factor and counted. Then, in a second step, associations between the ABM were investigated using common factor analysis. The breadth of a risk factor’s effect was judged by combining the number (count) of ABM related to this factor and the strength of association between these ABM. Flock age and DARK 3 appeared to affect several weakly correlated ABM, thus indicating a broad range of effects. Our findings suggest that manipulation of the predominant risk factors identified in this study (DARK 3, litter quality, and slaughter age) could generate improvements in the related ABM and thereby enhance the birds’ overall welfare statu...|$|R

Behavioral characteristics exhibited n this immediate reaction may be distinguished from those of longer-term trials involving growth, development and reproduction. Larvae of unstressed Heterodera schachtii populations and others stressed with carbofuran, oxamyl, phenamiphos or aldicarb were immersed in nematicide solutions. The oxamyl-stressed population {{was the only one}} indicating a significant loss of responsiveness. Protection was generally observed in stressed populations with few exceptions. Correlation of in vitro tests with greenhouse trial results was poor. A high proportion of H. schachtii retained the ability to respond to touch whether wild or stressed, after exposure to nonfumigant nematicide concentrations approaching 0. 1 O/O for 24 hours. The existence of cross-tolerance or cross-resistance is strong presumptive evidence for a common biological site of action for these nematicides; however, the high proportion of H. schachtii larvae exhibiting moderate activity in the <b>touch</b> <b>test</b> suggests that the four nonfumigant nematicides employed in these experiments are inefficient nematode acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

This study aimed at assessing broiler chicken welfare on industrial {{farms in the}} State of Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil, using the Welfare Quality(r) assessment protocol for poultry, to provide directly applicable scientific information. Results are presented as criteria scores ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better welfare; and percentages of prevalence. The scores classified as excellent (above 80) were absence of prolonged thirst, absence of prolonged hunger, litter quality, breast blister and <b>touch</b> <b>test.</b> Enhanced scores (between 55 and 80) were comfort around resting, plumage cleanliness and dust sheet test. Acceptable scores (between 20 and 55) were thermal comfort, stocking density, absence of injuries, footpad dermatitis and hock burn; and unacceptable scores (below 20) were lameness and qualitative behavioral assessment. The median percentage of mortality and culled birds were 5. 2 % and 0. 6 %, respectively.
