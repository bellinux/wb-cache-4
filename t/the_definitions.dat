5|$|At its 23rd meeting, held in 2007, the CGPM {{recommended}} that the CIPM should continue to investigate methods to provide exact fixed values for physical constants of nature that could then be used in <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> of units of measure {{in place of the}} IPK, thus enabling the transition from explicit unit definitions to explicit constant definitions.|$|E

30|$|Note {{here that}} <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> of {{singular}} values for tensors was first proposed by Lim in [3].

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> of {{cultural}} science depends on <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> of creative industries. The problem, however, is that unlike <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> of evolutionary economics, complexity science and new cultural studies, {{which are also}} elements of cultural science, the creative industries suffer multiple non-commensurable definitions. These are reviewed and analytic implications for <b>the</b> <b>definition</b> of cultural science are examine...|$|R
5|$|Findings on the {{frequency}} of each level of severity vary based on <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> and methods used in studies. A World Health Organization study estimated that between 70 and 90% of head injuries that receive treatment are mild, and a US study found that moderate and severe injuries each account for 10% of TBIs, with the rest mild.|$|E
5|$|In October 2011, at the 24th CGPM {{proposals}} {{were made to}} change <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> of four of the base units. These changes should not affect the average person.|$|E

5|$|The federal {{government}} and the states have long been permitted to limit obscenity or pornography.

5|$|With {{the fall}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Eastern Bloc ceased to exist; with it, so did all {{applicability}} of the term Second World. <b>The</b> <b>definitions</b> of the First World and Third World changed slightly, yet generally described the same concepts.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Scottish {{toxicologist}} John Duffus reviewed <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> used {{over the}} previous 60 years and concluded they were so diverse as to effectively render the term meaningless. Along with this finding, the heavy metal status of some metals is occasionally challenged {{on the grounds that}} they are too light, or are involved in biological processes, or rarely constitute environmental hazards. Examples include scandium (too light); vanadium to zinc (biological processes); and rhodium, indium, and osmium (too rare).|$|E
5|$|Largely {{concerned}} with gender issues, Midas comments on <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> of femininity and masculinity {{in the early}} nineteenth century and the developing ideology of separate spheres which encouraged women to restrict themselves to domestic affairs and men to political affairs. Part of the Romantic interest in rewriting classical myths, Midas focuses on challenging patriarchy and satirising the unbounded accumulation of wealth.|$|E

5|$|One {{prevailing}} {{idea is that}} carnivory {{in plants}} is not {{a black and white}} duality, but rather a spectrum from strict non-carnivorous photoautotrophs (a rose, for example) to fully carnivorous plants with active trapping mechanisms like those of Dionaea or Aldrovanda. However, passive traps are still considered fully carnivorous. Plants that fall between <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> in the strict carnivorous/non-carnivorous demarcation can be defined as being protocarnivorous.|$|E
5|$|The {{motivation}} {{for the development of}} the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the CGS systems and the lack of coordination between the various disciplines that used them. The CGPM, which was established by the Metre Convention of 1875, brought together many international organisations to not only agree on <b>the</b> <b>definitions</b> and standards of the new system but also agree on the rules for writing and presenting measurements in a standardised manner around the world.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals are {{generally}} defined as metals with relatively high densities, atomic weights, or atomic numbers. The criteria used, and whether metalloids are included, {{vary depending on}} the author and context. In metallurgy, for example, a heavy metal may be defined on the basis of density, whereas in physics the distinguishing criterion might be atomic number, while a chemist would likely be more concerned with chemical behaviour. More specific definitions have been published, but none of these have been widely accepted. <b>The</b> <b>definitions</b> surveyed in this article encompass up to 96 out of the 118 known chemical elements; only mercury, lead and bismuth meet all of them. Despite this lack of agreement, the term (plural or singular) is widely used in science. A density of more than 5g/cm3 is sometimes quoted as a commonly used criterion and is used in the body of this article.|$|E
