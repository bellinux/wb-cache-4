5|$|Some isopod {{groups have}} evolved a {{parasitic}} lifestyle, particularly as external parasites of fish. They can damage or kill their hosts {{and can cause}} significant economic loss to commercial fisheries. In reef aquariums, parasitic isopods can become a pest, endangering the fish and possibly injuring the aquarium keeper. Some {{members of the family}} Cirolanidae suck the blood of fish, and others, in the family Aegidae, consume the blood, fins, tail and flesh and can kill <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> the process.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific blue-eye {{is found}} in loose schools of tens to {{thousands}} of fish. They are generally found in the mid- to upper water column within 1 metre (3 ft) of the riverbank and often close to underwater cover. The Pacific blue-eye is euryhaline—it can survive {{in a wide range}} of water salinities from fresh-water to marine environments. It responds to changes in salinity (and resulting change in buoyancy) by changing the volume of its swim bladder, which takes up to 6 hours and 40 minutes when salinity is reduced and around 5 hours when it is increased. In the meantime, the fish can swim with a head-up or head-down posture, which either increases or decreases buoyancy respectively. This adaptation helps <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> the range of salinities it encounters in its estuarine environment.|$|E
25|$|Any fish {{processing}} usually occurs in deck houses or below deck. A wet fish stern trawler stores <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> ice or sea water {{which has been}} refrigerated. A freezer stern trawler stores <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> frozen boxes or blocks, and a factory stern trawler processes the catch. A pelagic stern trawler may use fish pumps to empty the codend.|$|E

25|$|When {{grizzly bears}} fish for salmon along {{the coasts of}} Alaska and British Columbia, they often only eat the skin, brain and roe of <b>the</b> <b>fish.</b> <b>In</b> doing so, they provide a food source for gulls, ravens, and foxes, all of which eat salmon as well; this {{benefits}} both the bear and the smaller predators.|$|E

25|$|Trout Pond - Park {{visitors}} could rent fishing {{equipment and}} go {{fishing in the}} pond, which was deliberately overstocked {{so it would be}} easy to catch fish.

25|$|Species such as {{shellfish}} that occupy intermediate trophic levels often play a dual role, both filtering organic bottom-level organisms {{from the}} water and generating some ammonia. Waste feed may also provide additional nutrients; either by direct consumption or via decomposition into individual nutrients. In some projects, the waste nutrients are also gathered and reused in the food given to <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> cultivation. This can happen by processing the seaweed grown into food.|$|E

25|$|Due to the King George whitings’ {{popularity}} {{as a food}} fish, extensive {{investigations into}} {{the viability of the}} species as an aquaculture species have occurred, with most initial investigations indicating the long larval cycle is a major barrier to the successful farming of the fish. Other problems have arisen in a parasite previously unknown in the species only affecting <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> captivity. Thyroid growth hormones may be used in the future to hasten growth of larvae and make such ventures more feasible.|$|E
25|$|The orange-spotted {{trevally}} has {{a silvery}} grey- to brassy-coloured body, becoming paler to a silvery white ventrally. Many conspicuous orange to yellow spots {{occur on the}} sides of the fish, giving the species its name, and make for an easy way to identify <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> the field. An entirely yellow variant has been reported, although the fish is thought to be able to rapidly change between its normal colour configuration and this colour. The colour of the fins ranges from hyaline to lemon yellow, and no dark opercular spot is present.|$|E
25|$|No {{complete}} and precise {{list of all}} <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> the Irrawaddy river basin currently exists, but in 1996 {{it was estimated that}} there are about 200 species. In 2008, it was estimated that the Irrawaddy ecoregion is home to 119–195 species of fish found nowhere else in the world (endemic). Several new species of fish have been described from the Irrawaddy river basin in recent years (for example, the cyprinid Danio htamanthinus in 2016 and the stone loach Malihkaia aligera in 2017), and it is likely that undescribed species remain.|$|E

25|$|Maniaq (lit. «roasted thing») is roasted (barbecued) over an {{open fire}} fish. All parts of the fish except the guts are used. Over an open fire, a green branch or drift wood is used by {{inserting}} the stick {{in the mouth of}} the fish, then pushing the stick though the fish along the backbone until the stick emerges {{at the base of the}} tail. the stick is then propped up near the open fire to begin roasting. a modern alternative is to wrap <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> foil and piece it in the camp fire.|$|E
25|$|In the Roman Empire, {{the first}} fish {{to be brought}} indoors was the sea barbel, which was kept under guest beds in small tanks made of marble. Introduction of glass panes around the year 50 AD allowed Romans to replace one wall of marble tanks, {{improving}} their view of <b>the</b> <b>fish.</b> <b>In</b> 1369, the Hongwu Emperor of China established a porcelain company that produced large porcelain tubs for maintaining goldfish; over time, people produced tubs that approached the shape of modern fish bowls. Leonhard Baldner, who wrote Vogel-, Fisch- und Tierbuch (Bird, Fish, and Animal Book) in 1666, maintained weather loaches and newts.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{otoliths}} accrete {{layers of}} calcium carbonate and gelatinous matrix throughout their lives. The accretion rate varies with {{growth of the}} fish – often less growth in winter and more in summer – which results in the appearance of rings that resemble tree rings. By counting the rings, {{it is possible to}} determine the age of <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> years. Typically the sagitta is used, as it is largest, but sometimes lapilli are used if they have a more convenient shape. The asteriscus, which is smallest of the three, is rarely used in age and growth studies.|$|E
5000|$|The Yami people cannot eat fishes {{from other}} tribes, {{they can only}} {{exchange}} within their own tribe. Moreover, the Yami people have to eat raw fish eyes {{as soon as they}} caught <b>the</b> <b>fishes</b> <b>in</b> order to avoid <b>the</b> <b>fishes</b> to escape.|$|R

25|$|A fishing rod's main {{function}} is to bend and deliver a certain resistance or power: While casting, the rod acts as a catapult: by moving the rod forward, the inertia {{of the mass of}} the bait or lure and rod itself, will load (bend) the rod and launch the lure or bait. When a bite is registered and the fisherman strikes, the bending of the rod will dampen the strike to avoid line failure. When fighting a fish, the bending of the rod not only enables the fisherman to keep the line under tension, but the bending of the rod will also keep the fish under a constant pressure which will exhaust the fish and enable the fisherman to actually catch the fish. Also the bending lessens the effect of the leverage by shortening the distance of the lever (the rod). A stiff rod will demand lots of power of the fisherman, while actually less power is put on <b>the</b> <b>fish.</b> <b>In</b> comparison, a deep bending rod will demand less power from the fisherman, but deliver more fighting power to <b>the</b> <b>fish.</b> <b>In</b> practice, this leverage effect often misleads fisherman. Often it is believed that a hard, stiff rod puts more control and power on the fish to fight, while it is actually the fish who is putting the power on the fisherman. In commercial fishing practice, big and strong fish are often just pulled in on the line itself without much effort, which is possible because the absence of the leverage effect.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the hook}} has been removed, return the trout into the water. Support the trout until it stabilizes. This {{includes}} holding <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> water {{deep enough to}} submerge its gills. After long fights, {{it may be necessary}} to manually move water past its gills. This can be done either by holding the trout in moving water with its head facing upstream, or, in calm water, moving the trout backwards and forwards repeatedly. Once stabilized, the trout will swim off on its own. If released prematurely, the trout, not having enough energy to move, will sink to the bottom of the river and suffocate. Take however long is necessary to revive a trout.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the dam and the forming of the reservoir had serious impacts on the salmon of the Baker River — the dam left only 1mile (1.6km) of river accessible to returning salmon. Before the dam was built, in many years, over twenty thousand salmon {{would return to the}} river to spawn. Afterwards, the returning population rarely would top 3,000fish, and decreased even more in the 1980s, culminating in a record low of 99fish in 1985. A structure was constructed across the lower Baker River below Lake Shannon, and this was originally used to capture returning anadromous fish and in conjunction with a few other facilities, carried fish up into Lake Shannon until 1959, when the system was extended to place <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> Baker Lake instead.|$|E
