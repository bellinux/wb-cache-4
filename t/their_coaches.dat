During his first and second retirements, Plante also coached goaltenders and consulted for several NHL teams, including the Oakland Seals, Philadelphia Flyers, Montreal Canadiens and St. Louis Blues.|$|E
5|$|The {{legislature}} heeded some of Clark's message. They added {{a second}} auditor {{in the office}} of the state auditor, and gave greater discretion to the state's sinking fund commission. They created a state board of education and the office of state superintendent. They also created county school commissioners in every county. In response to his remarks on slave property, the legislature enacted laws that raised the reward for apprehending a fugitive slave and made it illegal for stagecoach owners to allow fugitive slaves to use <b>their</b> <b>coaches</b> to escape.|$|E

5|$|Fourteen {{coaches have}} won the award in the same season that they have also won a National Coach of the Year award; of those, only Krzyzewski and Smith have {{achieved}} the feat three times. Four coaches have won during the same season that they have coached a team that won the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship: Frank McGuire, Norm Sloan, Dean Smith, and Gary Williams. North Carolina has the most ACC Coach of the Year awards with 12, while its in-state rival, Duke, is second with 10. Frank McGuire is the only head coach to win the award at two different schools (North Carolina and South Carolina). Each of the original 1953ACC members {{have had at least}} one of <b>their</b> <b>coaches</b> win the award. Among schools that joined the ACC before 2013, Boston College {{is the only one that}} has never had a winning coach. Thirty-one different coaches from twelve schools have received the award.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC, {{formerly}} the Australian Olympic Federation) is the peak body responsible for Australia's participation at the Olympics. Aside from funding the participation at the Olympics, the AOC provides {{money for the}} training and preparation of athletes. This occurs through their funding of the OWIA, grants for athletes to travel overseas to compete {{and the provision of}} monetary awards to athletes and <b>their</b> <b>coaches</b> if they win medals at World Cup events or World Championships in the lead up to the Olympics. The funding of the OWIA by the AOC varies by year, but hovers between AUD500,000 and 1,000,000, with a higher budget in the years immediately before an Olympics. Through the Australian Sports Commission, the federal government also sponsors OWIA, contributing {{more than half a million}} dollars a year. In 2009, the OWIA lobbied the government for an increase in its annual budget from AUD2.1m to AUD29.4m, a fraction of the AUD132m spent by Canada—the host of the 2010 Olympics. In contrast, the current funding for the Summer Olympics team is AUD128m per annum and the AOC asked for an increase of AUD108m annually in 2009. Australia aimed to win two medals in 2010, something that was achieved, and which Chesterman touted as justification for further funding to maintain and increase rankings in the face of growing expenditure by other countries.|$|E
5|$|The Mail coach service began {{towards the}} end of the 18th century, adding to the {{existing}} use of fast coaches. The horses required for fast coaches were mainly produced by outcrossing heavy farm mares to the lighter racing type of horse, as a combination of speed, agility, endurance and strength was required. While the aristocracy and gentry paid high prices for matched teams of quality horses, farmers sold the best of their animals at a good profit, keeping lower-quality animals for themselves, or for sale as saddle horses. The coaching trade grew from the trade in carriage of goods; some public transport was provided by farmers, who could keep large numbers of horses on their own farms more cheaply than those who had to buy in food and forage. However, proprietors of coaching inns accounted for most of the trade. In many cases a proprietor would work his horse teams only in his local district, but some owned many coaching establishments, and could provide transport over much greater distances. An advantage to proprietors of a string of coaching inns was that passengers on <b>their</b> <b>coaches</b> also used and paid for the services offered by their inns, often including overnight accommodation. Some inn proprietors owned hundreds of horses.|$|E

25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{a network}} of trains with {{sleeping}} cars operates daily between London and Scotland (Caledonian Sleeper), and between London and the West Country as far as Cornwall (Night Riviera). Using rolling stock designed and formerly operated by British Rail, these services offer a choice of single- or double-occupancy bedrooms. These services operate all week, except Saturdays and usually depart London (Euston and Paddington) in the evening, arriving at their destinations at approx 08:00. Both services use British Rail Mk3 sleeper coaches although the Caledonian Sleeper is having <b>their</b> <b>coaches</b> replaced with Mk 5 Coaches.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{males in}} {{competitive}} sports are often advised by <b>their</b> <b>coaches</b> {{not to be}} in intimate relationships based on the premises that they become more docile and less aggressive during an athletic event. The circumstances in which males and females experience aggression are also different. A study showed that social anxiety and stress was positively correlated with aggression in males, meaning as stress and social anxiety increases so does aggression. Furthermore, a male with higher social skills has a lower rate of aggressive behavior than a male with lower social skills. In females, higher rates of aggression were only correlated with higher rates of stress. Other than biological factors that contribute to aggression there are physical factors are well.|$|E
25|$|Missouri and Iowa State {{first met}} in 1896 and the {{regional}} rivalry was born. Before the 1959 match-up between the two schools, {{which took place in}} Ames, Iowa, field testing showed that the telephones the two schools used to communicate with <b>their</b> <b>coaches</b> in the coaches box were wired so that either school could hear what was happening on the other sideline. The problem was fixed before the game, but neither of the two coaches knew that. Northwestern Bell Telephone Company of Ames then decided to have a trophy made to commemorate the incident, and thus the Telephone Trophy was born. Missouri leads the rivalry 61–34–9 all-time. When Missouri left the Big 12 for the SEC the rivalry was essentially ended.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the years}} of war, Europe fell behind North America in terms of figure skating dominance. Many of the new top {{competitors}} came from the United States and Canada, bringing with them a style that emphasized speed, endurance, and dynamic movements. They included Americans Richard Button (who was the first skater to complete both the double axel jump and a loop jump with three rotations), Hayes Alan Jenkins, David Jenkins, Tenley Albright, and Carol Heiss; and Canadians Barbara Ann Scott and Donald Jackson. In 1961, the crash of Sabena Flight 548 {{claimed the lives of}} the entire United States figure skating team and <b>their</b> <b>coaches.</b> The event sharply reduced American strength in the sport for a period but by the late 1960s the country began a resurgence led by Peggy Fleming.|$|E
500|$|Members {{from the}} Rainmen profusely criticized the {{brutality}} of the Express throughout the series as well. Kevin Young was told {{by some of the}} Windsor players that their coach had told them to [...] "take out" [...] him, Liam McMorrow and Fisher. Cliff Clinkscales said, [...] "There's a difference between playing physical and dirty and hurting people." [...] Halifax entered Game 7 with two players out with concussions they suffered in the series itself. Clinkscales also played with injured ribs. Despite this, Levingston attempted to convince the players to play without <b>their</b> <b>coaches,</b> who favored forfeiting it. He also offered the Rainmen new coaches, a raised salary, and $1,000, but to no avail. Haywood said, [...] "How could we play without coach, bringing another coach in? And do what? Coach us? He doesn't even know us." [...] Levingston, on the other hand, slammed Clarós, saying that [...] "instead of leading our team to the championship, he led a group of talented players to broken contracts and a lifetime of controversy." [...] The owner claimed that he felt cheated and that the players were misled by <b>their</b> <b>coaches.</b> He took full responsibility for leading the Rainmen into the WFCU Centre ahead of schedule but believed that the two teams could have negotiated to avoid conflict.|$|E

5000|$|Task Review: Tenacity {{arranged}} for <b>their</b> <b>coach</b> tour to visit Blenheim Palace and Oxford and charged high prices for their tickets, {{with the team}} focusing on low costs, which were helped further by Mark's negotiations securing them good discounts at their sites. Their customers gave good feedback on <b>their</b> <b>coach</b> tour, thanks to Lauren's exceptional tour of Blenheim, offsetting both Felipe's rather mediocre tour in Oxford and the substandard refreshments they offered. Meanwhile, Summit {{arranged for}} <b>their</b> <b>coach</b> tour to visit Hever Castle and Canterbury and focused on offering low ticket prices, though had trouble securing discounts as James pushed for one that one site would not agree with. <b>Their</b> <b>coach</b> tour proved to be disastrously bad; despite offering good refreshments, traffic delayed their start, James forced a sing-along upon their customers, Jemma was ill-prepared for the tour of the castle, and the group got lost in Canterbury, cutting their visit to their second site. These mistakes effectively wrecked any chance of the team securing a win.|$|R
