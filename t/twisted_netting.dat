40|$|Background—Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is an inherited disease characterized by early onset of skeletal muscle degeneration and progressive weakness. Although dilated cardiomyopathy may occur during adolescence, {{it is often}} undetected early in its course because of physical inactivity and generalized debilitation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to apply the technique of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) tagging to detect occult cardiac dysfunction in young subjects with DMD by measuring myocardial strain and torsion. Methods and Results—Thirteen DMD pediatric subjects without clinically apparent heart disease and 9 age-matched healthy males were recruited. Each was scanned on a 1. 5 -T clinical scanner to acquire contiguous short-axis planes from the apex to the mitral valve plane and then 3 tagged images at base, midventricle, and apex. Global and segmental myocardial <b>net</b> <b>twist</b> and circumferential strain were computed with the use of 2 D homogeneous strain analysis.

40|$|As IC {{technology}} advances, {{the package}} size keeps shrinking while the pin count of a package keeps increasing. A modern IC package {{can have a}} pin count of thousands. As a result, a complex printed circuit board (PCB) can host more than ten thousand signal nets. Such a huge pin count and net count make manual design of packages and PCBs an extremely time-consuming and error-prone task. On the other hand, increasing clock frequency imposes various physical constraints on PCB routing. These constraints make traditional IC and PCB routers not applicable to modern PCB routing. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, there is no mature commercial or academic automated router that handles these constraints well. Therefore, automated PCB routers that are tuned to handle such constraints become a necessity in modern design. In this dissertation, we propose novel algorithms for three major aspects of PCB routing: escape routing, area routing and layer assignment. Escape routing for packages and PCBs has been studied extensively in the past. Network flow is pervasively used to model this problem. However, previous studies are incomplete in two senses. First, none of the previous works correctly model the diagonal capacity, which is essential for 45 degree routing in most packages and PCBs. As a result, existing algorithms may either produce routing solutions that violate the diagonal capacity or fail to output a legal routing even though one exists. Second, few works discuss the escape routing problem of differential pairs. In high-performance PCBs, many critical nets use differential pairs to transmit signals. How to escape differential pairs from a pin array is an important issue that has received too little attention in the literature. In this dissertation, we propose a new network flow model that guarantees the correctness when diagonal capacity is taken into consideration. This model leads to the first optimal algorithm for escape routing. We also extend our model to handle missing pins. We then propose two algorithms for the differential pair escape routing problem. The first one computes the optimal routing for a single differential pair while the second one is able to simultaneously route multiple differential pairs considering both routability and wire length. We then propose a two-stage routing scheme based on the two algorithms. In our routing scheme, the second algorithm is used to generate initial routing and the first algorithm is used to perform rip-up and reroute. Length-constrained routing is another very important problem for PCB routing. Previous length-constrained routers all have assumptions on the routing topology. We propose a routing scheme that is free of any restriction on the routing topology. The novelty of our proposed routing scheme is that we view the length-constrained routing problem as an area assignment problem and use a placement structure to help transform the area assignment problem into a mathematical programming problem. Experimental results show that our routing scheme can handle practical designs that previous routers cannot handle. For designs that they could handle, our router runs much faster. Length-constrained routing requires the escaped nets to have matching ordering along the boundaries of the pin arrays. However, in some practical designs, the net ordering might be mismatched. To address this issue, we propose a preprocessing step to untangle such <b>twisted</b> <b>nets.</b> We also introduce a practical routing style, which we call single-detour routing, to simplify the untangling problem. We discover a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of single-detour routing solutions and present a dynamic programming based algorithm that optimally solves the problem. By integrating our algorithm into the bus router in a length-constrained router, we show that many routing problems that cannot be solved previously can now be solved with insignificant increase in runtime. The nets on a PCB are usually grouped into buses. Because of the high pin density of the packages, the buses need to be assigned into multiple routing layers. We propose a layer assignment algorithm to assign a set of buses into multiple layers without causing any conflict. Our algorithm guarantees to produce a layer assignment with minimum number of layers. The key idea is to transform the layer assignment problem into a bipartite matching problem. This research result is an improvement over a previous work, which is optimal for only one layer...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{considerable}} interest in developing robotic aircraft, inspired by birds, {{for a variety of}} missions covering reconnaissance and surveillance. Flapping wing aircraft concepts have been put forth in light of the efficiency of flapping flight at small scales. These aircraft are naturally equipped with the ability to rotate their wings about the root, a form of wing articulation. This thesis covers some problems concerning the performance, stability and control of robotic aircraft with articulated wings in gliding flight. Speci cally, we are interested in aircraft without a vertical tail, which would then use wing articulation for longitudinal as well as lateral-directional control. Although the dynamics and control of articulated wing aircraft share several common features with conventional fi xed wing aircraft, the presence of wing articulation presents several unique benefi ts as well as limitations from the perspective of performance and control. One of the objectives of this thesis is to understand these features using a combination of theoretical and numerical tools. The aircraft concept envisioned in this thesis uses the wing dihedral angles for longitudinal and lateral-directional control. Aircraft with flexible articulated wings are also investigated. We derive a complete nonlinear model of the flight dynamics incorporating dynamic CG location and the changing moment of inertia. We show that symmetric dihedral con guration, along with a conventional horizontal tail, can be used to control flight speed and flight path angle independently of each other. This characteristic is very useful for initiating an efficient perching maneuver. It is shown that wing dihedral angles alone can e ffectively regulate sideslip during rapid turns and generate a wide range of equilibrium turn rates while maintaining a constant flight speed and regulating sideslip. We compute the turning performance limitations that arise due to the use of wing dihedral for yaw control, and compare the steady state performance of rigid and flexible winged aircraft. We present an intuitive but very useful notion, called the e ffective dihedral, which allows us to extend some of the stability and performance results derived for rigid aircraft to flexible aircraft. In the process, we identify the extent of flexibility needed to induce substantial performance bene fits, and conversely the extent to which results derived for rigid aircraft apply to a flexible aircraft. We demonstrate, interestingly enough, that wing flexibility actually causes a deterioration in the maximum achievable turn rate when the sideslip is regulated. We also present experimental results which help demonstrate the capability of wing dihedral for control and for executing maneuvers such as slow, rapid descent and perching. Open loop as well as closed loop experiments are performed to demonstrate (a) the e ffectiveness of symmetric dihedral for flight path angle control, (b) yaw control using asymmetric dihedral, and (c) the elements of perching. Using a simple order of magnitude analysis, we derive conditions under which the wing is structurally statically stable, as well as conditions under which there exists time scale separation between the bending and twisting dynamics. We show that the time scale separation depends on the geometry of the wing cross section, the Poisson's ratio of the wing material, the flight speed and the aspect ratio of the wing. We design independent control laws for bending and twisting. A key contribution of this thesis is the formulation of a partial diff erential equation (PDE) boundary control problem for wing deformation. PDE-backstepping is used to derive tracking and exponentially stabilizing boundary control laws for wing twist which ensure that a weighted integral of the wing <b>twist</b> (<b>net</b> lift or the rolling moment) tracks the desired time-varying reference input. We show that a control law which only ensures tracking of a weighted integral improves the stability margin of the twisting dynamics sixteen fold. A tracking control law is derived for the wing tip displacement which uses motion planning and a novel two-stage perturbation observer. This work on PDE-based control of wing deformation allows for the use of highly flexible wings on MAVs. Put together, the thesis provides a comprehensive understanding of the flight dynamics of a robotic aircraft equipped with articulated wings, and provides a set of control laws for performing agile maneuvers and for honing the bene fits of using highly flexible wings...|$|R
40|$|The {{active region}} {{magnetic}} field surrounding the filament {{plays an important}} role in filament formation, their evolution and disruption. We investigated a filament eruption that occurred in southern hemisphere of the Sun on July 08, 2011 using AIA and HMI data. The filament was located in a region close to the active region NOAA 11247 with its West-most footpoint anchored in the negative polarity plage region and the East-most in the positive polarity plage region. During observations, the magnetic flux was emerging in the active region and also in the plage regions. The flux emergence was stopped in West-most footpoint of the plage region about an hour before the filament eruption. A converging motion was also observed for many hours in the Western footpoint of the filament. The filament had left-handed <b>twist</b> and the <b>net</b> injected magnetic helicity was positive in both footpoints. Both sign of magnetic helicity were observed in the Western footpoint of the filament where the eruption has initiated. Further, an anti-clockwise rotational motion was observed in both the footpoints just after the onset of filament eruption which lasted for 6 min during the eruption process. The emerging flux, converging motion and injection of opposite magnetic helicity could be responsible for destabilizing of the Western footpoint of the filament leading to eruption. The torque imbalance between the expanded portion of the flux tube and the photosphere may have caused the rotation in the footpoint region which changed the trend in the injected magnetic helicity after the filament eruption.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Preterm birth {{leads to}} an early switch from fetal to {{postnatal}} circulation before completion of left ventricular in utero development. In animal studies, this results in an adversely remodeled left ventricle. We determined whether preterm birth {{is associated with a}} distinct left ventricular structure and function in humans. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 234 individuals 20 to 39 years of age underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance. One hundred two had been followed prospectively since preterm birth (gestational age= 30. 3 ± 2. 5 week; birth weight= 1. 3 ± 0. 3 kg), and 132 were born at term to uncomplicated pregnancies. Longitudinal and short-axis cine images were used to quantify left ventricular mass, 3 -dimensional geometric variation by creation of a unique computational cardiac atlas, and myocardial function. We then determined whether perinatal factors modify these left ventricular parameters. Individuals born preterm had increased left ventricular mass (66. 5 ± 10. 9 versus 55. 4 ± 11. 4 g/m(2); P 0. 99), but both longitudinal systolic (peak strain, strain rate, and velocity, P< 0. 001) and diastolic (peak strain rate and velocity, P< 0. 001) function and rotational (apical and basal peak systolic rotation rate, P = 0. 05 and P = 0. 006; <b>net</b> <b>twist</b> angle, P= 0. 02) movement were significantly reduced. A diagnosis of preeclampsia during the pregnancy was associated with further reductions in longitudinal peak systolic strain in the offspring (P= 0. 02, n= 29). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals born preterm have increased left ventricular mass in adult life. Furthermore, they exhibit a unique 3 -dimensional left ventricular geometry and significant reductions in systolic and diastolic functional parameters.

40|$|AbstractMesoscopic {{models of}} unmelted and locally melted supercoiled DNAs in 20 mM ionic {{strength}} are simulated over {{a range of}} linking difference from Δℓ= 0 to − 26 turns, or superhelix density from σ= 0 to − 0. 062. A domain containing m= 0, 28, or 56 melted basepairs (out of 4349 total) is modeled simply by a region of suitable length with substantially reduced torsion and bending elastic constants. Average structural properties are calculated from the saved configurations, and a reversible work protocol {{is used to calculate}} the supercoiling free energy, ΔGsc. The cross-writhe between duplex and melted regions (defined herein) is found to be negligibly small. The total writhe, radius of gyration, and ordered elements of the diagonalized inertial tensor are found to be nearly universal functions of the residual linking difference (〈Δℓr〉) associated with the duplex region, independent of m. However, deformability of the tertiary structure, as manifested by the variance of those same properties, is not a universal function of 〈Δℓr〉, but depends upon m. ΔGsc varies with 〈Δℓr〉 more strongly than 〈Δℓr〉 2 due to the low ionic strength. The twist energy parameter, ET, obtained from the simulated ΔGsc, 〈Δℓr〉, and <b>net</b> <b>twisting</b> strain of the melted region,〈TD〉, is found to be independent of m, hence also of the torsion and bending elastic constants of the melted region. However, ET increases linearly with −〈Δℓr〉, which leads to 1), a small overestimation of ET for any given 〈Δℓr〉, when ET is determined from the observed Δℓ and 〈Δℓr〉 by the protocol of Bauer and Benham; and 2), a significant enhancement of the apparent slope, ⁡−⁡dET/dT, obtained via the protocol of Bauer and Benham, relative to the actual slope at fixed 〈Δℓr〉. After taking these two effects into account, the theoretical and experimental ET values and −⁡dET/dT values agree rather well. For the larger Δℓ, the melted regions are found preferentially in the linker domains between interwound arms, rather than in the apical regions at the ends of interwound arms...|$|R
40|$|Background: Aortic {{stenosis}} (AS) is {{the most}} common heart valve disease in Europe and North America. Age-related calcification of the valve is the commonest cause of acquired AS, especially in patients older than 70 years. Conventional surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and the novel, minimally invasive transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), effectively preserve left ventricular (LV) function, relieve symptoms and improve survival in patients with severe symptomatic AS. However, patients with impaired LV function may carry significant operative risk, and long recovery time. In addition, such patients might have other comorbidities, and hence adding another challenge. Thus evaluation of ventricular function before and after AVR, as well as critical evaluation of TAVI patients should contribute to better clinical outcome. Methods: We studied LV function by conventional echocardiography before and after SAVR in the following groups; (I) 86 patients (aged 71 ± 10 years) with severe AS and LV dysfunction; (II) 112 consecutive elderly AS patients (aged 77 ± 2 years) and compared them with 72 younger patients (aged 60 ± 1 years); (III) 66 patients (age 70 ± 2 years, 53 male) who underwent AVR for severe AS with concurrent LV dysfunction; (IV) 89 consecutive patients with symptomatic severeAS who underwent successful TAVI, 45 of whom received trans-apical TAVI (TA) (age 80. 8 ± 4. 9 year, 26 male) and 44 trans-femoral TAVI (TF) (age 82. 9 ± 5. 8 year, 22 male). The conventional echocardiographic measurements were made according to the guidelines. Severe AS was identified by aortic valve mean pressure gradient > 40 mmHg or valve area < 1. 0 cm 2. LV systolic dysfunction was identified as ejection fraction (EF) < 50 %. LV long-axis function was presented by mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE) at lateral wall and septal wall, which were measured from apical four-chamber view. Also from the same view, LV septal and lateral wall deformation using STE as well as global longitudinal systolic strain. The LV systolic <b>twist</b> as the <b>net</b> difference between apical rotation and basal rotation was measured from the parasternal apical and basal short-axis views in the TAVI patients. Results: Study I: In the low flow and high gradient group, operative (30 -day) mortality was 10 %, and peri-operative mortality was associated with lower mean LVEF, higher mitral E:A ratio, peak systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PSPAP), and higher serum creatinine (all p< 0. 001), NYHA class III–IV, concomitant coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), urgent surgery, and longer bypass-time (all p< 0. 05). Mortality at 4 years was 17 %. Univariate predictors of 4 -year mortality were: lower EF (p< 0. 001), presence of restrictive LV filling (p< 0. 001), raised PSPAP (p< 0. 001) and CABG (p= 0. 037). However, only EF< 40 % (p= 0. 03), the presence of restrictive LV filling (p= 0. 033) and raised PSPAP (p< 0. 01) independently predicted mortality in this group. Study II: Elderly patients had higher NYHA class, more frequent atrial fibrillation (AF), coronary artery disease (CAD), emergency operation and use of bioprosthetic valves. They also had shorter E-wave deceleration time (DT) and larger left atria (LA) (p< 0. 05 for all). 30 -day mortality was 12 % vs 4 % (Log Rank x 2 = 3. 02, p= 0. 08) and long term mortality was 18 % vs 7 % (Log Rank x 2 = 4. 38,p= 0. 04) in the two groups, respectively. Age was not related to mortality after adjustment for other variables. Among all variables, anemia (OR 4. 20, CI: 1. 02 – 6. 86, p= 0. 04), cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (OR 1. 02, CI 1. 01 – 1. 04,p< 0. 01), significant patient prosthesis mismatch (PPM) (OR 5. 43, CI 1. 04 – 18. 40,p< 0. 05) were associated with 30 -day mortality in elderly patients. Their long-term mortality was related to CBP time (OR 1. 02, CI 1. 00 – 1. 05, p= 0. 04),PPM (OR 4. 64, CI 1. 33 – 16. 11, p= 0. 02) and raised LA pressure: DT (OR 0. 94, CI 0. 84 – 0. 99, p= 0. 03) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) (OR 1. 12, CI 1. 03 – 1. 19, p< 0. 001). STUDY III: Following SAVR peak aortic pressure gradient (AOPG) decreased and indexed valve area increased (64 ± 3 to 19 ± 1 mmHg and 0. 30 ± 0. 01 to 0. 89 ± 0. 03 cm 2 /m 2, p< 0. 001 for both). LVEF increased (from 45 ± 1 to 54 ± 2 %;p< 0. 001), LV end diastolic and end-systolic dimensions fell (LVEDD index: from 33 ± 1 to 30 ± 1 mm/m 2; and LVESD index: from 27 ± 1 to 20 ± 1 mm/m 2; (p< 0. 01 forboth). LV diastolic dysfunction improved as evidenced by the fall in E/A ratio (from 2. 6 ± 0. 2 to 1. 9 ± 0. 4) and prolongation of total filling time; (from 29. 2 ± 0. 6 to 31. 4 ± 0. 5 s/min, p= 0. 01 for both). Among all echocardiographic variables, LV dimensions (LVEDD index, OR 0. 70, CI 0. 52 – 0. 97, p< 0. 05; LVESD index, OR 0. 57, CI 0. 40 – 0. 85, p= 0. 005) were the two independent predictors of post-operative LV functional recovery on multivariate analysis. A cut-off value ofpre-operative LVESD index<= 27. 5 mm/m 2 was 85 % sensitive and 72 % specific inpredicting intermediate-term recovery of LV function after AVR (AUC, 0. 72, p= 0. 002). STUDY IV: Before TAVI, {{there was no difference between}} the two patient groups in gender, age, body surface area (BSA) and baseline LV function. However, left ventricular mass index (LVMi), left atrial volume index (LAVi) and tricuspid regurgitation pressure drop (TRPdrop) were increased in the TA group (p< 0. 05). One week after TAVI, aortic pressure gradient (AOPG) markedly dropped in thetwo groups (both p< 0. 001), LVEDD index and LVESD index fell but EF andmyocardial strain remained unchanged. Overall cavity twist reduced (p< 0. 048). Significant LVESD index reduction was only seen in TF group (p= 0. 02) with a slight increase in LVEF (p= 0. 04). Lateral MAPSE increased only in the TF group(p= 0. 02). LV longitudinal systolic strain remained unchanged in TA patients while apical lateral strain increased in TF group. LV apical rotation fell in the two groups but basal rotation increased only in the TA patients (p= 0. 02). LAVi reduced in bothgroups and to a greater extent in TF TAVI (p= 0. 006), as did TRPdrop (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: SAVR and TAVI are two effective treatments for severe AS patients. The severity of pre-operative systolic and diastolic LV dysfunction is the major predictor of mortality following SAVR for low-flow and high gradient AS. Peri-operative AVR survival is encouraging in the elderly. Long term mortality in the elderly is related to PPM, LV diastolic dysfunction and secondary pulmonary hypertension. LV functional recovery was evident in most patients with LV dysfunction after SAVR. A lower prevalence of LV functional recovery in patients with large pre-operative LVESD index might signify the loss of contractile reserveand thus predict post-operative functional recovery. TAVI results in significant early improvement of segmental and overall ventricular function, particularly in patients receiving the trans-femoral approach. The delayed recovery of the trans-apical TAVI group, we studied, might reflect worse pre-procedural diastolic cavity function...|$|R
