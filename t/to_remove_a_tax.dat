Williams, the U.S. Supreme Court held that in case where an individual paid <b>a</b> federal <b>tax</b> under protest <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>a</b> federal <b>tax</b> lien on her property where the tax she paid had been assessed against a third party, the waiver of sovereign immunity found in 28 USC section 1346(a)(1) authorized her tax refund suit.|$|R
50|$|A new $3 {{billion tax}} {{increase}} on alcopop drinks {{was designed to}} slow down a projected increase (from the Federal Health Minister, Nicola Roxon, tabling Treasury advice) in alcopop sales by 43 million bottles, curtailing binge drinking. However, the opposition described the increase as merely a revenue raiser, with Shadow Health Minister Joe Hockey arguing that consumers of alcopop will switch to other drinks, such as champagne, and binge drinking will not decrease. In response, the Prime Minister told Federal Parliament that the tax increase had wide support in medical and alcohol support services. Opposition Leader Brendan Nelson counter-offered with a $1.8 billion petrol tax cut, reversing years of policy opposing lowering petrol taxes. The Opposition pledged to block the alcopop tax in the Senate, which it will control until July 2008, and has also pledged to block <b>a</b> move <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>a</b> surcharge <b>tax</b> trap for people who fail to take out health cover, which, it claims, will drive up insurance premiums and steer people away from private healthcare.|$|R
