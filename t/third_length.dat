5000|$|Estonian {{has three}} phonemic lengths; however, the <b>third</b> <b>length</b> is a {{suprasegmental}} feature, {{which is as}} much tonal patterning as a length distinction. It is traceable to allophony caused by now-deleted suffixes, for example half-long linna < *linnan [...] "of the city" [...] vs. overlong linna < *linnahan [...] "to the city".|$|E
50|$|Both {{the regular}} short-long {{distinction}} and the suprasegmental length are distinctive, so that Estonian effectively has three distinctive vowel and consonant lengths, {{the distinction between}} the second and <b>third</b> <b>length</b> levels being at a level larger than the phoneme, such as the syllable or the foot. In addition to realizing greater phonetic duration, overlength in modern Estonian involves a pitch distinction where falling pitch is realized in syllables that are overlong and level pitch is realized in syllables that are short or long.|$|E

50|$|Unlike {{the small}} {{diameter}} fans used in turbofan jet engines, the main rotor on a helicopter {{has a large}} diameter that lets it accelerate a large volume of air. This permits a lower downwash velocity for a given amount of thrust. As it is more efficient at low speeds to accelerate {{a large amount of}} air by a small degree than a small amount of air by a large degree, a low disc loading (thrust per disc area) greatly increases the aircraft's energy efficiency, and this reduces the fuel use and permits reasonable range. The hover efficiency ("figure of merit") of a typical helicopter is around 60%. The inner <b>third</b> <b>length</b> of a rotor blade contributes very little to lift due to its low airspeed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The present paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} and computational study of axial collapse of the aluminum metallic shells having combined tube-frusta geometry between two parallel plates. Shells were having bottom two <b>third</b> <b>lengths</b> as frusta and remaining top one <b>third</b> <b>lengths</b> as tube. Shells were compressed to recognize their modes of collapse and associated energy absorption capability. An axisymmetric Finite Element computational model of collapse process is presented and analysed, using a non-linear FE code FORGE 2. Six noded isoparametric triangular elements were used to discretize the deforming shell. The material of the shells was idealized as rigid visco-plastic. To validate the computational model experimental and computed results of the deformed shapes and their corresponding load-compression and energy-compression curves were compared.

50|$|The Leyland National {{was built}} with integral, modular {{construction}} and a rear engine. All components {{were designed for}} ease of construction and replacement. Until 1978, it was always built with a distinctive roof mounted pod at the rear, housing the heating equipment, which consequently blew warm air out at roof level. At first the pod was almost {{the length of a}} bay and appeared designed to give a Trans-Atlantic feel. In 1976 a new shorter version of the roof pod was introduced along with the battery being relocated to the front under the cab. The Leyland National was available in three lengths, the majority being 10.3m and 11.3m. It was easy to spot the longer ones as its main side windows were all the same length, on the shorter models the windows were shorter except for one in the middle (where the exit doors were on dual door variants) which was the same length as on the longer models.The <b>third</b> <b>length</b> was 10.9m, specially produced for Australian operators due to stringent axle weight limits. This used the front section of the 11.3 metre bus and the rear action of the 10.3 metre bus. One 10.9 metre bus (the prototype) was sold to a Scottish operator (Rennies of Dunfirmline) and was fitted out to dual purpose specification for use on express services.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the static properties of periodic structures in weak random disorder. We apply a functional renormalization group approach (FRG) and a Gaussian variational method (GVM) to study their displacement correlations. We focus in particular {{on the effects}} of temperature and we compute explicitly the crossover length scales separating different regimes in the displacement correlation function. To do so using the FRG we introduce a functional form that approximate very accurately the flow of the disorder correlator at all scales. We compare the FRG and GVM results and find excellent agreement. We show that the FRG predicts in addition the existence of a <b>third</b> <b>length</b> scale associated with the screening of the disorder by thermal fluctuations and discuss a protocol to observe it.

40|$|We {{consider}} a generalization of spectral (frequency dependent) finite {{elements in the}} setting of random media. The determination is done {{in the setting of}} rods with spatial variabilities of mass density {{as well as those of}} elastic properties and cross-sectional geometric properties. All the material variabilities are described by random Fourier series with a typical (average) characteristic size of inhomogeneity d. The lat-ter varies from d much smaller than through d much larger than the wavelength. The <b>third</b> <b>length</b> scale enter-ing the problem, but kept constant, is the rod length. We investigate the relative effects of random noises in all the material parameters on the spectral stiffness matrices associated with the rod for a very wide range of frequencies. Basically, this is a study of the imperfection sensitivity of these matrices, which thereby also indicates what can and needs to be done in two and three dimensional problems...|$|E
40|$|This report {{investigates the}} use of three dierent schemes to {{optimize}} the number of states of linear left-to-right Hidden Markov Models (HMM). As the rst method we describe the xed length modeling scheme where each character model is assigned {{the same number of}} states. The second method considered is the Bakis length modeling where the number of model states is set to a given fraction of the average number of observations of the corresponding character. In the <b>third</b> <b>length</b> modeling scheme the number of model states is set to a speci ed quantile of the corresponding character length histogram. This method is called quantile length modeling. A comparison of the dierent length modeling schemes has been carried out with a handwriting recognition system using o-line images of cursively handwritten English words from the IAM database. For the xed length modeling a recognition rate of 61 % has been achieved. Using Bakis or quantile length modeling the word recognition rates could be improved to over 69 %...|$|E

40|$|Localized photopolymerization of smectic liquid {{crystalline}} monomers lock in {{structures on}} three different length scales (1, 2). The first length scale is {{set by the}} resolution of lithographic mask {{that is being used}} and can go down into the sub-micrometer region with the minimum size being restricted only by the diffraction limits. The second length scale is set by the periodicity of the smectic layers and can be equivalent to the length of the monomers, or smaller in case of interdigitation, but is typically of the order of a few nanometers. And the <b>third</b> <b>length</b> scale is the intermolecular distance between the molecules packed in the smectic layers, which is usually around 0. 4 nm. By modifying the smectic molecules partly with non-covalent hydrogen bridges (H-bridges) the smectic periodicity can break-up into separated layers with a well-defined space, often also in the nanometer range. This principle is shown schematically in Figure 1. The nanopores form by breaking the hydrogen bridges in the polymer at elevated temperatures or by contact with an alkaline solution. The integrity of the film is maintained by the presence of fully covalent smectic monomers. The process of pore formation and the properties of the films formed are elaborated further in this paper...|$|E

40|$|If one {{has three}} sticks (lengths), when {{can you make}} a {{triangle}} with the sticks? As long as any two of the lengths sum to a value strictly larger than the <b>third</b> <b>length</b> one can make a triangle. Perhaps surprisingly, if one is given 6 sticks (lengths) there is no simple way of telling if one can build a tetrahedron with the sticks. In fact, even though one can make a triangle with any triple of three lengths selected from the six, one still {{may not be able}} to build a tetrahedron. At the other extreme, if one can make a tetrahedron with the six lengths, there may be as many 30 different (incongruent) tetrahedra with the six lengths. Although tetrahedra have been studied in many cultures (Greece, India, China, etc.) Over thousands of years, there are surprisingly many simple questions about them that still have not been answered. This thesis answers some new questions about tetrahedra, as well raising many more new questions for researchers, teachers, and students. It also shows in an appendix how tetrahedra can be used to illustrate ideas about arithmetic, algebra, number theory, geometry, and combinatorics that appear in the Common Cores State Standards for Mathematics (CCSS -M). In particular it addresses representing three-dimensional polyhedra in the plane. Specific topics addressed are a new classification system for tetrahedra based on partitions of an integer n, existence of tetrahedra with different edge lengths, unfolding tetrahedra by cutting edges of tetrahedra, and other combinatorial aspects of tetrahedra...|$|E
40|$|Adolescent is a {{vulnerable}} group in reproductive health area. This period {{is marked by}} strong desire to try and explore new things. Pornography is a medium which can influence adolescent toward high risk sexual behaviour. The exposure to pornographic materials {{is a serious problem}} among adolescent since it could have negative impacts such as unwanted pregnancy, unsafe abortion, sexually transmitted diseases and HIV-AIDS. This cross-sectional study was conducted tounderstand various types of pornographic exposures, effects of pornographic exposure, and factors influence the effect. Study was conducted at five state junior high schools in Pontianak District in 2008 with 395 respondents from December 2007 to January 2008. The result shows that 83. 3 % adolescence has exposed to pornography and 79. 5 % of them had experienced the effects of pornographic exposure. 19. 8 % respondent who experienced the effects of pornography was in the addiction stage. 69. 2 % respondent of those in addiction stage was in escalation stage. 61. 1 % respondent of escalation stage was in desensitization stage, and 31. 8 % respondent of desensitization was in act-out stage. Multivariate analysis shows that there were four variables that have significant relationship to the effect ofpornographic exposure, that is gender (male), grade at school (<b>third),</b> <b>length</b> of exposure (recent) and frequency of exposure (often).
