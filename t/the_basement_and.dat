5|$|A {{fundraising}} {{campaign for}} the £19 million planned refurbishment was assisted by appearances from, among others, Richard Briers, Stephanie Cole, Judi Dench, Prunella Scales, Patrick Stewart and Timothy West. £5.3 million {{was provided by the}} Arts Council. During the closure the company staged productions in the Studio theatre, <b>the</b> <b>Basement</b> <b>and</b> in other locations around Bristol, including Sally Cookson’s Treasure Island on King Street in summer 2011 and Melly Still’s revival of Coram Boy at the Colston Hall at Christmas 2011.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, the Princess {{had stopped}} booking live acts and was {{focusing}} {{exclusively on the}} more profitable cinema side of the business. Revenues from the rental spaces in <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> upper floors had also begun to flow in. Notably, Hugh Morrow, a beat cop, had leased apartment 205. His granddaughter Susan Morrow would manage the Princess from 1981 to 1994.|$|E
5|$|Dillmann {{then decided}} to try {{wheelchair}} basketball again. She retrieved her old basketball chair, now somewhat mouldy and smelly, from <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> <b>and</b> sought a game with her old team, RSV Lahn-Dill. Her debut game with the seconds saw the basketball officials reaching for their rulebooks {{to see if the}} old chair, of a type they had never seen, was still legal.|$|E

50|$|The {{floors of}} <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> <b>and</b> upper floors were poured in 20.5 sq ft slabs. These slabs were 11 in thick in <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> <b>and</b> on <b>the</b> first floor, and 9.5 in thick on all other floors. The roof was a 7.5 in slab. Spandrel beams {{were not used}} in the {{flooring}} system. The exception was on the fourth floor: With offices to be located on the third floor, the architects wanted {{to do away with}} column caps in order to provide space for lighting fixtures and to avoid light-scattering. Spandrels in the fourth floor were needed to compensate for the weaker support. Flooring throughout the structure was Kreolite, a creosote-impregnated wood block.|$|R
5|$|Fight Club {{was filmed}} mostly {{at night and}} Fincher {{purposely}} filmed the daytime shots in shadowed locations. The crew equipped the bar's basement with inexpensive work lamps to create a background glow. Fincher avoided stylish camerawork when filming early fight scenes in <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> instead placed the camera in a fixed position. In later fight scenes, Fincher moved the camera {{from the viewpoint of}} a distant observer to that of the fighter.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>basement,</b> <b>and</b> {{for part}} of the home's history, the main living area, is {{accessed}} via a staircase {{at the back of the}} first-floor hall. The steep stairs still show years of wear. One of the rooms off the main basement is the kitchen where Glidden is said to have experimented with the coffee grinder and his wife's hair pins, eventually leading to his brand of barbed wire.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} six levels {{and a final}} battle. The player {{controls}} Bart as he helps his sister Maggie recover her ball, explores <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> attic of the Simpsons' home, sneaks out to the movie theater and the Springfield Mall, and has a dream {{in which he is}} inserted into the Itchy & Scratchy universe. During these levels, Bart fights dust bunnies, spiders (in the attic), ghosts (in the basement), space mutants (at the movie theater), and Itchy and Scratchy (in the dream world).|$|E

Two showrooms at the house {{are open to the}} public. Aside from the tearoom, the exhibition in <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> ground floor contains numerous displays related to the Rhys family, the history of the estate and World War II, and is designed as if the year is 1912.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} building's {{main floor}} has vaulted ceilings, large windows, brick walls, a flat roof, and wooden cross beams. The mezzanine {{consists of three}} rooms. The second floor has large windows and vaulted ceilings, restrooms, and a lunchroom. Stairs and elevators connect the levels, including <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> its boiler room. A lobby and office in {{the southwest corner of}} the main floor can be entered from inside or via the original main door off Southeast 10thAvenue.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{accounts}} {{of some of the}} guards, there may have been an opportunity for {{one or more of the}} guards to rescue a survivor. Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the assassinations. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> <b>and</b> in the corridor of the house. Some guards who had not participated in the murders and had been sympathetic to the grand duchesses were left in the basement with the bodies.|$|E

5|$|Firefighters began {{experiencing}} {{problems before}} they even reached the fire. By the time firefighters reached the 11th floor the building had lost power after {{the heat from the}} blaze damaged electrical cables. The emergency generator never began producing electricity, and despite efforts to restore power the building was without electricity for the entirety of the event. This forced firefighters to work in darkness and without the aid of elevators. In addition, the transformers that provided power to the neighboring Girard Trust Building were in the basement of One Meridian Plaza. The transformers were eventually shut down due to water accumulation in <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> firefighters directing water streams from that building had to do so without the aid of elevators.|$|E
5|$|Ianto {{returns to}} <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> is devastated to find Lisa dead. He then sees the {{delivery}} girl, {{who has a}} large cut across her forehead; Lisa implanted her brain into the delivery girl. At first reluctant, Ianto aims his gun at her, but cannot bring himself to shoot her. The girl tries to explain she did this for Ianto, but then promises {{that they can be}} upgraded together. The rest of the Torchwood team, arriving to hear that, open fire and kill her, leaving Ianto to mourn.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, the Nazis {{decided to}} {{increase}} greatly the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II, {{which had been}} designed as a mortuary with morgues in <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> ground-level incinerators, was converted into a killing factory by installing gas-tight doors, vents for the Zyklon B (a highly lethal cyanide-based pesticide) to be dropped into the chamber, and ventilation equipment to remove the gas thereafter. It went into operation in March. Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the start as gassing centers, were also constructed that spring. By June 1943, all four crematoria were operational. Most {{of the victims were}} killed using these four structures.|$|E

Travelators were also {{installed}} in the building {{for the convenience of}} shoppers serving between Basement 2, <b>Basement</b> 1 <b>and</b> Level 1.|$|R
5|$|On July 2, 1862, William and Jim Anderson {{returned}} to Council Grove and sent an accomplice to Baker's house {{claiming to be}} a traveler seeking supplies. Baker and his brother-in-law brought the man to a store, where they were ambushed by the Anderson brothers. After a brief gunfight, Baker and his brother-in-law fled into the store's basement. The Andersons barricaded the door to <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> lit the store on fire, killing Baker and his brother-in-law. They also burnt Baker's home and stole two of his horses before returning to Missouri on the Santa Fe Trail.|$|E
5|$|Some biographers' {{accounts}} {{speculated that}} the opportunity for {{one or more of}} the guards to rescue a survivor existed. Yakov Yurovsky demanded that the guards come to his office and turn over items they had stolen following the murder. There was reportedly a span of time when the bodies of the victims were left largely unattended in the truck, in <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> in the corridor of the house.

5|$|The Portuguese, {{after their}} arrival in Sri Lanka in 1505, began a {{campaign}} of forced conversion and destruction of many Buddhist and Hindu temples around the island. They destroyed the Munneswaram temple completely in 1578 CE {{with the exception of}} <b>the</b> <b>basement,</b> <b>and</b> used the core of the building as a Roman Catholic chapel. Jesuits recorded that they used iron bars to destroy the presiding deity. According to a 1640 Portuguese records, they were able to convert 500 people from the village of Munneswaram as Roman Catholics. However, the locals and temple administrators were able to hide many of the idols of the temple complex before the destruction.|$|E

5000|$|The {{building}} was originally designed in 1892 by {{the architect of}} the Capitol, Edward Clark, as a cluster of three row houses for himself and family members including his brother Champ Clark, another brother known as [...] "the artist" [...] and a sister. The residences were connected through <b>the</b> <b>basements</b> <b>and</b> main floors and contained separate sleeping quarters upstairs.|$|R
5|$|The house, {{along with}} Dinefwr Castle, {{have since been}} {{restored}} by the National Trust and Cadw respectively. It is a three-storey castellated structure, built from grey stone, with four tall towers in each corner, with sloping slate roofs. The front features a grand central porch. Two rooms {{are open to the}} public, including a tearoom and exhibition in <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> ground floor which contain numerous displays related to the history of the estate and occupants. The deer park which surrounds the property was landscaped by Capability Brown in 1775. The surrounding woodland consists mainly of oak and wych elm. Newton House is cited {{as one of the most}} haunted houses in Wales, noted in particular for its ghost of Walter the Butler, a former employee whose tobacco smoke purportedly wafts through the air.|$|E
5|$|The palace is {{structured}} {{around a large}} and paved courtyard. It has a trapezoidal plan, and the land falls away toward the river Ill. To compensate for the slope, the riverside (southern) façade of the main wing has four floors (including the Mansard roof), while the courtyard (northern) façade has three floors. The half-buried floor corresponds to <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> now houses the archaeological museum (see below, Museums). The riverside façade is thus both the highest and the widest of the palace. The terrace before it, facing the quai des Bateliers, is closed at both ends by elaborate wrought-iron gates adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan.|$|E
5|$|Built of {{red brick}} with Chilmark and Portland stone dressings, {{the house has}} a compact, {{rectangular}} plan and has two main floors, plus a basement and an attic floor lit by dormer windows. On the south façade, there are eight casement windows in <b>the</b> <b>basement</b> <b>and</b> nine sash windows {{on each of the}} ground floor and first floor. The bay with the three central windows projects forwards slightly, and the central ground floor window is pedimented. The lead-covered hipped roof has a central flat section, surrounded by a balustrade with a cupola rising from its centre. The dormer windows are in a central, balustraded terrace of three, with an outlying window on either side. The house is entered from the north through a later mid-19th-century porte-cochère, while to the south there is a stone-flagged terrace with balustrade extending the full width of the building, and broad shallow steps leading down to the lawns. The east façade has a triple-arched loggia with access to the garden, while to the west there is access to the later 18th-century laundry and kitchen garden.|$|E
