5|$|Non-SI units whose {{values in}} SI units must be {{obtained}} experimentally (Table 7). This list includes various units of measure used in atomic and nuclear physics and in astronomy {{such as the}} dalton, <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> mass, <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> volt, the astronomical unit, the solar mass, {{and a number of}} other units of measure that are well-established, but dependent on experimentally-determined physical quantities.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>electron</b> {{microscope}} directs {{a focused}} {{beam of electrons}} at a specimen. Some electrons change their properties, such as movement direction, angle, and relative phase and energy as the beam interacts with the material. Microscopists can record these changes in <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> beam to produce atomically resolved images of the material. In blue light, conventional optical microscopes have a diffraction-limited resolution of about 200nm. By comparison, electron microscopes are limited by the de Broglie wavelength of <b>the</b> <b>electron.</b> This wavelength, for example, is equal to 0.0037nm for electrons accelerated across a 100,000-volt potential. The Transmission Electron Aberration-Corrected Microscope is capable of sub-0.05nm resolution, {{which is more than}} enough to resolve individual atoms. This capability makes <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> microscope a useful laboratory instrument for high resolution imaging. However, electron microscopes are expensive instruments that are costly to maintain.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} the radius of <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> is a {{challenging}} problem of the modern theoretical physics. The admission of the hypothesis of a finite radius of <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> is incompatible to the premises {{of the theory of}} relativity. On the other hand, a point-like electron (zero radius) generates serious mathematical difficulties due to the self-energy of <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> tending to infinity.|$|E
50|$|When {{electrons}} are accelerated, as {{occurs when}} an AC electrical field is impressed on an antenna, they will radiate electromagnetic waves. These waves carry energy that {{is taken from}} <b>the</b> <b>electrons.</b> <b>The</b> loss of energy of <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> appears as an effective resistance to the movement of <b>the</b> <b>electrons,</b> analogous to <b>the</b> ohmic resistance caused by scattering of <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> in <b>the</b> crystal lattice of the metallic conductor.|$|R
50|$|The {{wavelength}} {{distribution of}} the scattered photons tells us the energy distribution of <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> in <b>the</b> plasma, giving us a direct unobtrusive way of getting the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>electrons.</b> <b>The</b> amount of photons we actually collect can also {{tell us something about}} the density of <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> in <b>the</b> plasma.|$|R
5000|$|Electrons are {{produced}} by a hot cathode that is heated to about 1100 C. <b>The</b> <b>electrons</b> are accelerated to relativistic speeds (99.999+% {{of the speed of}} light) with an energy of 450 MeV in a linear accelerator. [...] From the linear accelerator, <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> are injected into the booster synchrotron. Here, <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> are sent around an oval racetrack of electromagnets, providing further acceleration. Within one-half second, <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> reach 7 GeV of energy. [...] Upon reaching that energy, <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> are injected into the storage ring, a 1104 m circumference ring of more than 1,000 electromagnets.|$|R
5|$|When an {{electron}} is moving through a magnetic field, it {{is subject to}} the Lorentz force that acts perpendicularly to the plane defined by the magnetic field and <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> velocity. This centripetal force causes <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> to follow a helical trajectory through the field at a radius called the gyroradius. The acceleration from this curving motion induces <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> to radiate energy in the form of synchrotron radiation. The energy emission in turn causes a recoil of <b>the</b> <b>electron,</b> known as the Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac Force, which creates a friction that slows <b>the</b> <b>electron.</b> This force is caused by a back-reaction of the electron's own field upon itself.|$|E
5|$|A {{neptunium}} atom has 93 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 5f46d17s2. This {{differs from the}} configuration expected by the Aufbau principle in that one electron is in the 6d subshell instead of being as expected in the 5f subshell. This {{is because of the}} similarity of <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> energies of the 5f, 6d, and 7s subshells. In forming compounds and ions, all the valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> configuration of the noble gas radon; more commonly, only some of the valence electrons will be lost. <b>The</b> <b>electron</b> configuration for the tripositive ion Np3+ is 5f4, with the outermost 7s and 6d electrons lost first: this is exactly analogous to neptunium's lanthanide homolog promethium, and conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of neptunium was measured to be at most (6.19±0.12)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before 5f and 6d; more recent measurements have refined this to 6.2657eV.|$|E
5|$|As of the 2006 CODATA {{recommended}} values, {{the relative}} uncertainty in determinations of the Avogadro constant by the X-ray crystal density method is , {{about two and}} a half times higher than that of <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> mass method.|$|E
25|$|This {{model is}} even more {{approximate}} than the model of hydrogen, because it treats <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> in each shell as non-interacting. But <b>the</b> repulsions of <b>electrons</b> {{are taken into account}} somewhat by the phenomenon of screening. <b>The</b> <b>electrons</b> in outer orbits do not only orbit the nucleus, but they also move around <b>the</b> inner <b>electrons,</b> so <b>the</b> effective charge Z that they feel is reduced by the number of <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> in <b>the</b> inner orbit.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of di{{electric}}s such as glass, the electric field of the light acts on <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> in <b>the</b> material, and <b>the</b> moving <b>electrons</b> generate fields and become new radiators. The refracted light in the glass is {{the combination of the}} forward radiation of <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> and <b>the</b> incident light. The reflected light is the combination of the backward radiation of all of <b>the</b> <b>electrons.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... {{first and}} <b>the</b> second <b>electron</b> is of <b>the</b> {{order of the}} quarter-cycle of the driving field. In these two cases, <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> appear in {{different}} quadrants of the correlated spectrum. If following <b>the</b> recollision, <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> are ejected ...|$|R
5|$|Atoms {{were thought}} to be the {{smallest}} possible division of matter until 1897 when J.J. Thomson discovered <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> through his work on cathode rays.|$|E
5|$|B snurposomes {{are found}} in the {{amphibian}} oocyte nuclei and in Drosophila melanogaster embryos. B snurposomes appear alone or attached to the Cajal bodies in <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> micrographs of the amphibian nuclei.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria exhibit an {{extremely}} {{wide variety of}} metabolic types. The distribution of metabolic traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their taxonomy, but these traits often do not correspond with modern genetic classifications. Bacterial metabolism is classified into nutritional groups {{on the basis of}} three major criteria: the kind of energy used for growth, the source of carbon, and <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> donors used for growth. An additional criterion of respiratory microorganisms are <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> acceptors used for aerobic or anaerobic respiration.|$|E
50|$|At high temperatures, heavy fermion {{compounds}} {{behave like}} normal metals and <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> {{can be described}} as a Fermi gas, in which <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> are assumed to be non-interacting fermions. In this case, the interaction between <b>the</b> f <b>electrons,</b> which present a local magnetic moment and <b>the</b> conduction <b>electrons,</b> can be neglected.|$|R
50|$|Once in the {{conduction}} band, <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> {{are free}} to move and diffuse throughout the crystal. Since <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> are being excited preferentially in the bright fringes, <b>the</b> net <b>electron</b> diffusion current is towards the dark-fringe regions of the material.|$|R
40|$|The Allis-Chalmers {{betatron}} is a high-energy induc­tion {{electron accelerator}} commercially made for taking industrial X-ray photographs. In this application, <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> emitted from a hot filament are accelerated dur­ing the first quarter-cycle of an alternating magnetic field, which is excited by a 180 cps sine wave source. During <b>the</b> acceleration, <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> are constrained to a stable orbit of constant radius {{by having the}} field of special shape. When <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> have reached <b>the</b> desired energy, the orbit is expanded and <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> strike a thin, heavy-element target. The rapid decelera­tion causes <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> to lose their energy principally {{in the form of}} gamma rays (X-rays). The energy spectrum of these rays is continuous and ranges up to the kinetic energy of <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> when they strike the target. In nuclear physics work, the maximum energy of the X-ray spectrum must be accurately known and continuously variable. This means that the orbit must be expanded at the time in the cycle when <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> have <b>the</b> required energy. This present work is concerned with the electronic circuitry which has been developed to cause the orbit to expand when <b>the</b> instantaneous <b>electron</b> energy reaches some adjustable preset value...|$|R
5|$|Each atomic orbital {{corresponds}} to a particular energy level of <b>the</b> <b>electron.</b> <b>The</b> <b>electron</b> can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an electron in a higher energy state can drop to a lower energy state while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by {{the differences in the}} energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines.|$|E
5|$|Electrons can {{transfer}} between different orbitals by the emission or absorption of photons with an energy {{that matches the}} difference in potential. Other methods of orbital transfer include collisions with particles, such as electrons, and the Auger effect. To escape the atom, the energy of <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> must be increased above its binding energy to the atom. This occurs, for example, with the photoelectric effect, where an incident photon exceeding the atom's ionization energy is absorbed by <b>the</b> <b>electron.</b>|$|E
5|$|For example, the {{stability}} and low energy of <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> cloud state in helium accounts for the element's chemical inertness, and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other, producing the lowest melting and boiling points of all the elements.|$|E
50|$|Geissler tubes {{had enough}} air {{in them that}} <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> could only travel a tiny {{distance}} before colliding with an atom. <b>The</b> <b>electrons</b> in these tubes moved in a slow diffusion process, never gaining much speed, so these tubes didn't produce cathode rays. Instead they produced a colorful glow discharge (as in a modern neon light), caused when <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> or ions struck gas atoms, exciting their orbital electrons to higher energy levels. <b>The</b> <b>electrons</b> released this energy as light. This process is called fluorescence.|$|R
3000|$|..., the {{magnetic}} field bends the trajectory of <b>the</b> <b>electrons,</b> resulting in a rotation of the spin of <b>the</b> transmitted <b>electrons.</b> <b>The</b> reflected <b>electrons</b> suffer similar spin rotations accompanied by the reversal of the momentum p [...]...|$|R
25|$|Once the electron's spin was discovered, it {{was clear}} that the {{magnetism}} should be due to a large number of <b>electrons</b> spinning in <b>the</b> same direction. It was natural to ask how <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> all know which direction to spin, because <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> on one side of a magnet don't directly interact with <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> on <b>the</b> other side. They can only influence their neighbors. The Ising model was designed to investigate whether a large fraction of <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> could be made to spin in the same direction using only local forces.|$|R
5|$|Hexagonal {{boron nitride}} forms atomically thin layers, {{which have been}} used to enhance <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> {{mobility}} in graphene devices. It also forms nanotubular structures (BNNTs), which have with high strength, high chemical stability, and high thermal conductivity, among its list of desirable properties.|$|E
5|$|If this dimer existed as a dicarbene, <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> {{lone pairs}} on the carbenic carbon {{would be forced}} into close proximity. Presumably the {{resulting}} repulsive electrostatic interactions {{would have a significant}} destabilising effect. To avoid this electronic interaction, the carbene units dimerise.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum {{chemistry}} tends not {{to involve}} π bonding due to <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> {{configuration of the}} element: thus its organometallic chemistry is quite limited. The best characterized organolanthanum compounds are the cyclopentadienyl complex La(C5H5)3, which is produced by reacting anhydrous LaCl3 with NaC5H5 in tetrahydrofuran, and its methyl-substituted derivatives.|$|E
5000|$|In atomic physics, {{the central}} field {{approximation}} for many-electron atoms takes the combined electric {{fields of the}} nucleus and all <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> acting on any of <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> to be radial and {{to be the same}} for all <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> in <b>the</b> atom. That is, every electron sees an identical potential [...] that is only a function of its distance from the nucleus.|$|R
40|$|Dynamics {{of a hot}} {{electron}} cloud with an initially Maxwellian electron distribution is considered both numerically and analytically. It is shown {{that only a small}} group of <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> propagates into <b>the</b> plasma but the main group of <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> is concentrated near the initial location of the cloud. The distribution of <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> left presents a plateau with the maximum velocity growing linearly with distance...|$|R
50|$|Like other solids, {{semiconductor}} {{materials have}} an electronic band structure {{determined by the}} crystal properties of the material. The actual energy distribution among <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> is described by the Fermi level and the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>electrons.</b> At absolute zero temperature, all of <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> have energy below the Fermi level; but at non-zero temperatures the energy levels are filled following a Boltzmann distribution.|$|R
5|$|Many catabolic {{biochemical}} processes, such as glycolysis, the {{citric acid}} cycle, and beta oxidation, produce the reduced coenzyme NADH. This coenzyme contains electrons {{that have a}} high transfer potential; in other words, they will release {{a large amount of}} energy upon oxidation. However, the cell does not release this energy all at once, as this would be an uncontrollable reaction. Instead, the electrons are removed from NADH and passed to oxygen through a series of enzymes that each release a small amount of the energy. This set of enzymes, consisting of complexes I through IV, is called <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> transport chain and is found in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Succinate is also oxidized by <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> transport chain, but feeds into the pathway at a different point.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} {{works by}} using energy-releasing chemical reactions to drive energy-requiring reactions: The {{two sets of}} reactions {{are said to be}} coupled. This means one cannot occur without the other. The flow of electrons through <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> transport chain, from electron donors such as NADH to electron acceptors such as oxygen, is an exergonic process– it releases energy, whereas the synthesis of ATP is an endergonic process, which requires an input of energy. Both <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> transport chain and the ATP synthase are embedded in a membrane, and energy is transferred from electron transport chain to the ATP synthase by movements of protons across this membrane, in a process called chemiosmosis. In practice, this is like a simple electric circuit, with a current of protons being driven from the negative N-side of the membrane to the positive P-side by the proton-pumping enzymes of <b>the</b> <b>electron</b> transport chain. These enzymes are like a battery, as they perform work to drive current through the circuit. The movement of protons creates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane, which is often called the proton-motive force. It has two components: a difference in proton concentration (a H+ gradient, ΔpH) and a difference in electric potential, with the N-side having a negative charge.|$|E
5|$|Plasma {{frequency}}: <b>The</b> <b>electron</b> {{plasma frequency}} (measuring plasma oscillations of the electrons) is large {{compared to the}} electron-neutral collision frequency (measuring frequency of collisions between electrons and neutral particles). When this condition is valid, electrostatic interactions dominate over the processes of ordinary gas kinetics.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>electrons</b> {{responsible}} for <b>the</b> brightest forms of aurora are well {{accounted for by}} their acceleration in the dynamic electric fields of plasma turbulence encountered during precipitation from the magnetosphere into the auroral atmosphere. In contrast, static electric fields are unable to transfer energy to <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> due to their conservative nature. <b>The</b> <b>electrons</b> and ions that cause the diffuse aurora appear not to be accelerated during precipitation.|$|R
50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> in <b>the</b> atom are excited, {{for example}} by being heated, the {{additional}} energy pushes <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> to higher energy orbitals. When <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> fall {{back down and}} leave the excited state, energy is re-emitted {{in the form of}} a photon. The wavelength (or equivalently, frequency) of the photon is determined by the difference in energy between the two states. These emitted photons form the element's spectrum.|$|R
50|$|While in the {{conduction}} band, <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> may {{with some}} probability recombine with the holes {{and return to}} the impurity levels. The rate at which this recombination takes place determines how far <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> diffuse, and thus the overall strength of the photorefractive effect in that material. Once back in the impurity level, <b>the</b> <b>electrons</b> are trapped and can no longer move unless re-excited back into the conduction band (by light).|$|R
