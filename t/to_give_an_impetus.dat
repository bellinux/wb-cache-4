On ascending the main street, I was not a little surprised at discovering the sort of amusement that was going on, and in which it seemed to me all the youths of the place were engaged. By youths, I do not mean lads of twelve and fourteen, but young men of eighteen and twenty, the amusement being that of sliding down hill, or [...] "coasting," [...] as I am told it is called in Boston. The acclivity was quite sharp, and of sufficient length <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>impetus</b> to the sled, that was set in motion at a short distance above the English church; an impetus that would carry it past the Dutch church--a distance that was somewhat {{more than a quarter of}} a mile.

As children, or boys as late in life as fourteen even, every male in the colony, and not a few of the females, had acquired this art; but this was the first place in which I had ever known adults to engage in the sport. The accidental circumstance of a hill's belonging to the principal street, joined to the severity of the winters, had rendered an amusement suited to grown people, that, elsewhere, was monopolized by the children.|$|E
6000|$|Men have {{a respect}} for {{scholarship}} and learning greatly {{out of proportion to}} the use they commonly serve. We are amused to read how Ben Jonson engaged, that the dull masks with which the royal family and nobility were to be entertained should be [...] "grounded upon antiquity and solid learning." [...] Can there be any greater reproach than an idle learning? Learn to split wood, at least. The necessity of labor and conversation with many men and things, to the scholar is rarely well remembered; steady labor with the hands, which engrosses the attention also, is unquestionably the best method of removing palaver and sentimentality out of one's style, both of speaking and writing. If he has worked hard from morning till night, though he may have grieved that he could not be watching the train of his thoughts during that time, yet the few hasty lines which at evening record his day's experience will be more musical and true than his freest but idle fancy could have furnished. Surely the writer is to address a world of laborers, and such therefore must be his own discipline. He will not idly dance at his work who has wood to cut and cord before nightfall in the short days of winter; but every stroke will be husbanded, and ring soberly through the wood; and so will the strokes of that scholar's pen, which at evening record the story of the day, ring soberly, yet cheerily, on the ear of the reader, long after the echoes of his axe have died away. The scholar may be sure that he writes the tougher truth for the calluses on his palms. They give firmness to the sentence. Indeed, the mind never makes a great and successful effort, without a corresponding energy of the body. We are often struck by the force and precision of style to which hard-working men, unpractised in writing, easily attain when required to make the effort. As if plainness, and vigor, and sincerity, the ornaments of style, were better learned on the farm and in the workshop, than in the schools. The sentences written by such rude hands are nervous and tough, like hardened thongs, the sinews of the deer, or the roots of the pine. As for the graces of expression, a great thought is never found in a mean dress; but though it proceed from the lips of the Woloffs, the nine Muses and the three Graces will have conspired to clothe it in fit phrase. Its education has always been liberal, and its implied wit can endow a college. The world, which the Greeks called Beauty, has been made such by being gradually divested of every ornament which was not fitted to endure. The Sibyl, [...] "speaking with inspired mouth, smileless, inornate, and unperfumed, pierces through centuries by the power of the god." [...] The scholar might frequently emulate the propriety and emphasis of the farmer's call to his team, and confess that if that were written it would surpass his labored sentences. Whose are the truly labored sentences? From the weak and flimsy periods of the politician and literary man, we are glad to turn even to the description of work, the simple record of the month's labor in the farmer's almanac, to restore our tone and spirits. A sentence should read as if its author, had he held a plough instead of a pen, could have drawn a furrow deep and straight to the end. The scholar requires hard and serious labor <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>impetus</b> to his thought. He will learn to grasp the pen firmly so, and wield it gracefully and effectively, as an axe or a sword. When we consider the weak and nerveless periods of some literary men, who perchance in feet and inches come up to the standard of their race, and are not deficient in girth also, we are amazed at the immense sacrifice of thews and sinews. What! these proportions,--these bones,--and this their work! Hands which could have felled an ox have hewed this fragile matter which would not have tasked a lady's fingers! Can this be a stalwart man's work, who has a marrow in his back and a tendon Achilles in his heel? They who set up the blocks of Stonehenge did somewhat, if they only laid out their strength for once, and stretched themselves.|$|E

A total of 144 and 119 coral species were recorded at big Yongle atoll and small Lingyang Reef, respectively. The real coral richness might be higher because species accumulation curve did not saturate. The coral diversity pattern was similar between big Yongle atoll and small Lingyang Reef. Coral communities fell into three clusters, consistent with their habitats on reef slope, reef flat and lagoon slope. The highest coral diversity was observed on reef slopes and the lowest coral diversity was found on lagoon slope. Genera richness was a better proxy for representing coral species diversity on both the big and small atoll but percent live coral cover was not a robust proxy on the small atoll, which only explained 24 % of species diversity.

40|$|Almost {{seventy-five years}} ago, in the ‘Traversariana’ section {{of his famous}} Ultimi contributi alla storia degli umanisti, Cardinal Giovanni Mercati {{mentioned}} a curious opusculum De sacerdotio D. N. Christi, ascribed in a few manuscripts and a 1496 Bolognese incunable to Ambrogio Traversari. Mercati {{pointed out that the}} text is actually a translation of a short Greek treatise that has been transmitted both independently and as a lemma in the large Byzantine Suda lexicon (compiled in the twelfth century). He lists five different Latin translations of this apocryphal excerpt: a first one by bishop Robert Grosseteste of Lincoln in the thirteenth century, and then four from the fifteenth century: the one ascribed to Traversari, another one by the Venetian humanist Lauro Quirini (along with an alleged second version of the same translation, edited by an anonymous reviser), the one dedicated in 1476 by Francesco Filelfo to Pope Sixtus IV, and finally another anonymous translation, which was printed a first time in 1541 and reprinted at least four times {{in the course of the}} sixteenth century. Although the tale about Jesus’ priesthood may have become well-known in the West thanks to its insertion as the Ἰησοῦς lemma in the Suda lexicon, the apocryphal story was originally an independent composition, and early on it was translated into various other languages as well. This story about Jesus’ alleged Jewish priesthood (which is as much to be read as a corroboration of the Virgin Birth narrative) is known in a shorter and a longer redaction of the original Greek version, but also in Church Slavonic, Arabic and Georgian translations. However, the translations into Latin are the most numerous – and the less studied. When Mercati published his overview of these Latin versions, he referred to some manuscript witnesses – mainly from the Vatican library – and added a few letters illustrating the circulation of in particular Quirini’s version. Yet, since Mercati’s seminal study was published, scholarship has hardly added any new findings about the transmission and reception of these translations, and none of the Latin renderings has hitherto been published in a modern scholarly edition. The present contribution aims to fill that gap by providing reliable editions of these texts and hopes thereby <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>an</b> <b>impetus</b> to more thorough research concerning the proliferation and reception of a fascinating apocryphal story that in the fifteenth century seems to have stirred wide interest. status: publishe...|$|E

First we calculate the cross correlations between cyclical components of real GDP {{of the different}} economies of the Union. The study then evaluate the concordance index proposed by Harding and Pagan [2002]. The results of the two approaches converge. They show that real cycles of the countries of WAEMU are weakly synchronous. Business cycles of the Ivory Coast, Mali and Niger are in phase {{with that of the}} WAEMU as a whole. The study also shows the asynchronous nature of the business cycle of Benin and that of the WAEMU. The results first demonstrate the high level of the risk that the common monetary policy will be countercyclical in some countries and procyclical in others, and secondly that the use of the common monetary policy in response to asymmetric shocks will cost for some countries. These results highlight the need <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> new <b>impetus</b> <b>to</b> the integration process to accelerate the cyclical convergence of WAEMU countries and facilitate the implementation of a common monetary policy that will be advantageous to all the countries the Union. ...|$|R
