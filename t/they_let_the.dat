5|$|The FBI {{intends to}} plant a fake {{advertisement}} to replace Lecktor's, but they realize that without the proper book code the Tooth Fairy will know it is fake; therefore, <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> advertisement run as it is, and Graham organizes an interview with Lounds, during which he gives a false and derogatory profile of the Tooth Fairy to incite him. After a sting operation fails to catch the killer, Lounds is kidnapped by the Tooth Fairy (Tom Noonan). Waking in the killer's home, he is shown a slideshow of William Blake's The Great Red Dragon paintings, along with the Tooth Fairy's past victims and slides of a family the killer identifies as his next targets. Lounds is forced to tape-record a statement before being set on fire in a wheelchair and killed, his flaming body rolled into the parking garage of the National Tattler as a warning.|$|E
5|$|The Tsentralka, {{the group}} {{plotting}} a mutiny of the Black Sea Fleet, decided on June 25, 1905, that the mutiny should start on Potemkin rather than Rostislav. On June 27, 1905, {{the day of}} the battleship Potemkin mutiny, Rostislav was sailing under the ensign of Vice Admiral Alexander Krieger. Nicholas II ordered Krieger and his superior, fleet commander Grigory Chukhnin, to destroy the rebels by force, but the admirals refrained from shooting. <b>They</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> rebels flee to Odessa and later to Romania. Krieger's own crew {{was on the verge of}} open mutiny. On July 2, 1905, a military council held on board Rostislav decided to moor the ships in Odessa, disconnect the engines from the propellers and let the enlisted men walk ashore at will. By the time of the Ochakov mutiny in November 1905, fleet morale had improved and Krieger did not hesitate to fire two 10-inch and fourteen 6-inch shells against the rebels.|$|E

Before Tom's death I saw on the Continent the overcautious way riders were tested for dope, as if the {{authorities}} feared to lift the veil, scared of {{how to handle the}} results; knowing all the while what they would be.

25|$|The Pamunkey {{tradition}} of pottery making {{dates back to}} before the English settled Jamestown. They have been using clay from {{the banks of the}} Pamunkey River since prehistoric times. Many continue to use the traditional method. To do so, <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> clay dry, then break it into smaller pieces. These pieces are soaked in water until reaching the consistency of cream. The clay is strained to remove rocks or debris. The water is drained and pressed out until the clay is like dough. It is then ready to be made into pots. Traditional pottery by Pamunkey ancestors of the Woodland Period was strengthened with crushed or burned shells, crushed steatite, river pebbles, or quartz sand.|$|E
25|$|The best-known mole {{is named}} after the city of Puebla, mole poblano. The origin of this sauce is disputed {{and there are two}} {{versions}} of the legend that are most often cited. The first states that 16th century nuns from the Convent of Santa Rosa were worried because they had just found out that the archbishop was going to visit them and they had nothing to prepare for him except for an old turkey in the yard. Supposedly due to divine inspiration, they began to mix together many of the spices and flavorings they had on hand in the kitchen, including different types of chili peppers, other spices, day-old bread, chocolate and approximately twenty other ingredients. <b>They</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> sauce simmer for hours and poured it over the turkey meat. Fortunately, the archbishop was very pleased with the meal and the nuns were able to save face.|$|E

However, <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> Celtics win their first road playoff game 94–80 in Game 3. Game 4 saw the Pistons win 94–75, however they lost Game 5 106–102 despite a scoring run late in the game. In Game 6, the Pistons strolled into the fourth quarter leading 70–60, but a lack of focus, a poor game from Rasheed Wallace, and a rally-destroying turnover by Tayshaun Prince ultimately led to their demise, as the Pistons would end their season losing 89–81. With that, the Celtics {{moved on to the}} NBA Finals, and they would face the Los Angeles Lakers for the 11th time.|$|E

500|$|Among other {{information}} retrieved from the archives was {{the revelation that}} the remaining Italian stone mosaics {{were found in the}} burned debris of the castle. Scott-Clark and Levy concluded in their report that the reason the Soviets conducted extensive searches for the Amber Room, even though their own experts had concluded that it was destroyed, was because they wanted to know if any of their own soldiers had been responsible for the destruction. Scott-Clark and Levy also assessed that others in the Soviet government found the theft of the Amber Room a useful Cold War propaganda tool. Russian government officials have since denied these conclusions. Adelaida Yolkina, senior researcher at the Pavlovsk Palace, reportedly stated: [...] "It is impossible to see the Red Army being so careless that <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> Amber Room be destroyed".|$|E

500|$|The book {{begins as}} an autobiography. Couillard {{was born in}} the late-1960s in the Montreal {{district}} of Ville-Émard; then she moved to the suburb of Lorraine when she was 4. Her parents often fought as her mother believed that her husband was unfaithful; the family incurred financial problems when Couillard's father changed careers. At age 12, Couillard was diagnosed with epilepsy. At age 17, she bought several properties with a boyfriend. They lived together briefly before breaking up and selling the properties. Couillard then became a friend, then lover, of Gilles Giguère, a money lender who was associated with the controversial motorcycle club Hells Angels. In 1996, after the police raided Giguère's apartment and (according to Couillard) threatened him, Giguère became sullen and withdrawn: the police had charged him with conspiracy to commit murder. But twomonths later, <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> charge drop. [...] Giguère was soon murdered.|$|E
500|$|The {{performances}} of Peña and Gyllenhaal were also praised by critics.

[...] The Los Angeles Times Betsy Sharkey applauded the chemistry between the two lead actors, {{as well as their}} individual performances, writing, [...] "As good as Gyllenhaal is in this, Peña nearly steals the show." [...] In a review for USA Today, Claudia Puig commended Gyllenhaal for [...] "giv his best performance since Brokeback Mountain" [...] and Peña for [...] "shin with charisma".

[...] He wrote the book based on an outline approved by Bungie and the [...] "Halo Story Bible", a book containing all information on the characters and universe in which Halo takes place, so that his story would not conflict with other Halo publications. Nylund found it easier to write with the [...] "Bible" [...] available as the details of the universe he was writing in were already established, only minor alterations were made to fit the novel into the universe. A seven-week deadline was established for Nylund to write the book. According to Trautmann, the book was nearly cancelled because Bungie was opposed to the idea of the Master Chief having a definite backstory. They eventually relented after Trautmann made them the offer that <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> book be completed and published in exchange for he, Matt Soell, and Brannon Boren completing Combat Evolveds script, which was still [...] "80 percent" [...] unfinished.|$|E

500|$|Rivens story {{continues}} where Myst and its companion novel, The Book of Atrus, left off. The player {{assumes the}} role of the Stranger, the protagonist of the first game and friend of Atrus (Rand Miller). Atrus knows the ancient art of creating [...] "linking books", specially written books that serve as portals to other worlds known as [...] "Ages". Atrus needs the Stranger's help to free his wife, Catherine (Sheila Goold; voice by Rengin Altay), who is held hostage in her home Age of Riven, which is slowly collapsing. Her captor is Gehn (John Keston), Atrus' manipulative father and self-declared ruler of Riven. Thirty years earlier, Atrus and Catherine trapped Gehn on Riven by removing all of the linking books that led out of the Age; the very last book to be removed, linking to the Age of Myst, was the one they held to escape Riven. In the belief that it would be destroyed, <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>the</b> book fall into the Star Fissure, a rift leading out of the damaged Age of Riven into a mysterious, space-like void. Catherine was later tricked into returning to Riven by her sons, Sirrus and Achenar, whereupon she was taken hostage by Gehn. Eventually, the player discovered the unharmed Myst book, leading to the events in Myst.|$|E
