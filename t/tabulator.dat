2500|$|He {{invented the}} first {{automatic}} card-feed mechanism {{and the first}} keypunch. [...] The 1890 <b>Tabulator</b> was hardwired to operate on 1890 Census cards. A control panel in his 1906 Type I <b>Tabulator</b> simplified rewiring for different jobs. [...] The 1920s removable control panel supported prewiring and near instant job changing. These inventions were among {{the foundations of the}} data processing industry and Hollerith's punched cards (later used for computer input/output) continued in use for almost a century.|$|E
2500|$|The 1921 census {{introduced}} {{automatic machine}} tabulation equipment, hired from England for the census. [...] Three punched cards {{were used to}} store individual, dwelling and family information. The cards were processed using an electric sorting machine prior to final totalling with an electric <b>tabulator</b> machine, devised by Herman Hollerith.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, the American Herman Hollerith invented data storage on punched cards that {{could then be}} read by a machine. To process these punched cards he invented the <b>tabulator,</b> and the {{keypunch}} machine. His machines used electromechanical relays and counters. [...] Hollerith's method {{was used in the}} 1890 United States Census. [...] That census was processed two years faster than the prior census had been. Hollerith's company eventually became the core of IBM.|$|E

2500|$|Herman Hollerith (February 29, 1860 â€“ November 17, 1929) was an American {{inventor}} {{who developed}} an electromechanical punched card <b>tabulator</b> {{to assist in}} summarizing information and, later, accounting. He was {{the founder of the}} Tabulating Machine Company that was [...] amalgamated (via stock acquisition) in 1911 with three other companies to form a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company later renamed IBM. Hollerith is {{regarded as one of the}} seminal figures in the development of data processing. His invention of the punched card tabulating machine marks the beginning of the era of semiautomatic data processing systems, and his concept dominated that landscape for nearly a century.|$|E
2500|$|To {{facilitate}} typewriter use {{in business}} settings, a tab (<b>tabulator)</b> key was {{added in the}} late nineteenth century. Before using the key, the operator had to set mechanical [...] "tab stops", pre-designated locations to which the carriage would advance when the tab key was pressed. This facilitated the typing of columns of numbers, freeing the operator from the need to manually position the carriage. The first models had one tab stop and one tab key; later ones allowed as many stops as desired, and sometimes had multiple tab keys, each of which moved the carriage a different number of spaces ahead of the decimal point (the tab stop), to facilitate the typing of columns with numbers of different length ($1.00, $10.00, $100.00, etc.) ...|$|E

50|$|In this style, {{the hard}} <b>tabulator</b> (ts in vi) is kept at eight columns, while a soft <b>tabulator</b> is often {{defined as a}} helper also (sw in vi), and set at four. The hard tabulators are used to indent code blocks, while a soft <b>tabulator</b> (four spaces) of {{additional}} indent is used for all continuing lines that must be split over multiple lines.|$|E
5000|$|The word tab {{derives from}} the word tabulate, which means [...] "to arrange data in a tabular, or table, form." [...] When a person wanted to type a table (of numbers or text) on a typewriter, {{there was a lot}} of {{time-consuming}} and repetitive use of the space bar and backspace key. To simplify this, a horizontal bar was placed in the mechanism called the <b>tabulator</b> rack. Pressing the tab key would advance the carriage to the next <b>tabulator</b> stop. The original <b>tabulator</b> stops were adjustable clips that could be moved from place to place on the <b>tabulator</b> rack. Fredric Hillard filed a patent application for such a mechanism in 1900.|$|E

5000|$|The machine {{actually}} took {{several years of}} work {{to get ready for}} market due to the complex design of the <b>tabulator</b> which employed a circular housing around the mainspring containing numbered notches that matched [...] "space for space" [...] with actual carriage travel. This ensured that stops for the decimal <b>tabulator</b> placed in the notches thus corresponded to carriage position.|$|E
