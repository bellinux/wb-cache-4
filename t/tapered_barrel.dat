25|$|Some {{time between}} 2007 and 2008, Ruger added a heavier <b>tapered</b> <b>barrel</b> to the Mini series. The heavier barrel had an overall larger {{diameter}} with the barrel visibly becoming thicker {{in the final}} inches as the barrel approaches the gas block from the muzzle. These changes combined with tighter tolerances result in greater potential accuracy.|$|E
2500|$|The Ranch Rifles are {{currently}} {{the most basic}} models, generally offered in a wood or synthetic rifle stock paired with a blued or stainless steel receiver and a standard 18.5" [...] <b>tapered</b> <b>barrel</b> (1:9" [...] RH twist rate). These rifles feature an adjustable ghost ring rear sight and winged front sight, and they are sold with a detachable scope rail mount and a choice of two 20-round or 5-round detachable box magazines to comply with some U.S. {{states and other countries}} which have laws restricting magazine capacity. All models are chambered in both [...]223 Remington and 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition except the Target Rifle variant (which is [...]223 only).|$|E
50|$|The CZ 455 Jaguar uses {{an unusually}} long 28.6-inch (726 mm) <b>tapered</b> <b>barrel</b> with rear tangent sight and a Bavarian-style stock.|$|E
50|$|The MK I added a Target model, {{which had}} a 5.5 in bull barrel, or a 6.875 in heavy <b>taper</b> <b>barrel</b> and {{adjustable}} sights. The MK II added a slide stop that held the slide open on the last round, and also was available in stainless steel. The MK II has been available {{in a number of}} barrel lengths; 4.75 in and 6 in lightweight barrels; 4 in, 5.5 in, 6.875 in and 10 in bull barrels, and 5.25 in and 6.875 in heavy <b>tapered</b> <b>barrels.</b> All guns with bull or heavy <b>tapered</b> <b>barrels</b> are Target models, and are equipped with target sights consisting of an adjustable rear sight and a taller, wider front sight, with an aggressive undercut to reduce glare. The MK II target model(KMK-678) had polygon rifling where other models had traditional land and groove riling.|$|R
50|$|All forty 0-4-4T {{locomotives}} were rebuilt as 4-4-0 tender locomotives between 1899 and 1902. Twenty six locos retained their parallel domed boilers while fourteen received new Standard No 3 parallel domeless boilers (later {{replaced by}} the <b>taper</b> <b>barrel</b> version of that type).|$|R
5000|$|CMMG Mk47 AKS13 - Released in 2016, has a 13" [...] medium <b>taper</b> profile <b>barrel</b> and Krink muzzle device.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, the Standard Mark III has a <b>tapered</b> <b>barrel,</b> {{black plastic}} {{handgrips}} and a blued finish. It comes {{with either a}} 6-inch or 4.75-inch barrel. It has fixed sights.|$|E
50|$|Some {{time between}} 2007 and 2008, Ruger added a heavier <b>tapered</b> <b>barrel</b> to the Mini series. The heavier barrel had an overall larger {{diameter}} with the barrel visibly becoming thicker {{in the final}} inches as the barrel approaches the gas block from the muzzle. These changes combined with tighter tolerances result in greater potential accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Armour-piercing, {{composite}} non-rigid projectile {{design was}} a high density core within a shell of soft iron or other alloy, but fired by a gun with a <b>tapered</b> <b>barrel.</b> The projectile was initially full-bore, but the outer shell was deformed as it passes through the taper, leaving the projectile with a smaller overall cross-section and giving it better flight characteristics.|$|E
5000|$|Marlin Model 700, a [...]22 LR {{semi-automatic}} rifle, {{similar to}} the Model 795, but has a heavy <b>tapered</b> target <b>barrel</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|CMMG Mk47 Mutant AKM CA - Has a 16" [...] medium <b>taper</b> profile <b>barrel</b> with an SV brake with a CMMG {{single stage}} trigger.|$|R
5000|$|CMMG Mk47 K Pistol - Has a 10" [...] medium <b>taper</b> profile <b>barrel</b> with a Magpul MOE {{pistol grip}} and a CMMG single stage trigger.|$|R
5000|$|In 1963, Marlin {{added the}} [...]44 Magnum {{cartridge}} as an optional chambering in the Model 336T carbine, which featured a straight grip, a 20-inch round <b>tapered</b> <b>barrel,</b> and a full-length magazine. However, the rifle experienced continuing problems in loading and chambering the short [...]44 Magnum cartridge, and in 1964 Marlin abruptly dropped the [...]44 Magnum option.|$|E
5000|$|The S&W Model 625 Mountain Gun is a {{lightweight}} {{version of the}} 625, with a shortened underlug and <b>tapered</b> <b>barrel,</b> and [...] "Mountain Gun" [...] etched {{on one side of}} the barrel. The standard Model 625 Mountain Gun fires [...]45 Colt through a 4-inch (102 mm) barrel. In 2001, a limited edition was also built by the Smith & Wesson Performance Center that uses [...]45 ACP ammunition. Both of these revolvers have adjustable rear sights and Hogue rubber grips.|$|E
50|$|The M40A5 {{designation}} superseded the M40A3 in 2009, {{though the}} evolution {{between the two}} systems occurred gradually over a longer period. The primary difference between the M40A5 and the M40A3 is the barrel: The A3's target crown has been replaced with a threaded muzzle and straight <b>tapered</b> <b>barrel</b> to allow the installation of a Surefire muzzle brake and sound suppressor. All M40A5s are fitted with a Badger Ordnance detachable magazine system and a forward rail mount for the AN/PVS-22 night vision optic.|$|E
5000|$|CMMG Mk47 Mutant T CA - Has a 16" [...] medium <b>taper</b> profile <b>barrel,</b> CMMG {{single stage}} trigger, A4 6-Position Collapsible Stock and an A2 Pistol Grip.|$|R
5000|$|CMMG Mk47 AKS8 - Released in 2016, {{can be used}} in {{a pistol}} and in a SBR {{configuration}} with a 8" [...] medium <b>taper</b> profile <b>barrel</b> and a Krink muzzle device.|$|R

5000|$|OD Green: Officially {{designated}} as the Model 8334 (.22 LR) or 8335 (.22 WMR), {{it has the same}} dimensions as the 18" [...] barrel Standard model (and is under the [...] "Standard" [...] category on the Ruger website), but with a threaded varminter-style straight <b>tapered</b> <b>barrel</b> with no iron sights, and comes with factory Weaver rail installed. Because of the many similarities in appearance to the Predator model from the centerfire line, it has been nicknamed the [...] "Rimfire Predator" [...] by some users ...|$|E
50|$|A problem {{affecting}} gun laying, was the tapered external barrel shape. This affected elevation {{when the}} gun was aimed by sighting {{along the top of}} the barrel. In the early 17th century, 'dispart sights' compensated for this. This was a piece of metal placed on the muzzle to make the line of sight parallel to the axis of the bore. Another technique involved measuring the depth of the barrel through the touchhole and at the muzzle, the difference being the wedge size needed to compensate for the <b>tapered</b> <b>barrel.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{many ways}} the Standard model is a {{groundbreaking}} design, lacking the slide found on conventional pistols, instead it sports a cylindrical bolt which cycles inside a tubular receiver in a manner more characteristic of a rimfire rifle. The bolt of the pistol features protruding “ears” at its rear which are grasped and pulled rearward to feed the initial round and cock the action. Using the basic blowback form of operation, the Standard model originally came with a blued carbon steel finish and was equipped with a 4.75 in <b>tapered</b> <b>barrel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... at 2500 rpm, {{dry weight}} 522 lb plus two turbochargers of 28.2 lb each. Similar to the TSIO-550-E with new oil sump and capacity, {{decreased}} maximum continuous power, increased turbo boost pressure, decreased engine speed rating and <b>tapered</b> cylinder <b>barrel</b> fins.|$|R
5000|$|... at 2600 rpm, {{dry weight}} 558 lb plus two turbochargers of 35.2 lb each. Similar to the TSIO-550-E except for FADEC fuel {{injection}} and ignition control, turbochargers, <b>tapered</b> cylinder <b>barrel</b> fins, oil sump and capacity, {{maximum continuous speed}} and manifold pressure rating.|$|R
2500|$|Brookes can be [...] {{identified}} {{by the presence of}} at least one band of wrought iron at the breech and a rough-finished, <b>tapering</b> <b>barrel.</b> The barrels were made of cast iron for ease of manufacture, but one or more wrought iron bands was welded around the chamber to reinforce it against the high chamber pressure exerted when the gun fired. Because no southern foundries had the capacity to wrap the rifles in a single band like the Parrott design, a series of smaller bands were used, each usually [...] thick and [...] wide. All of Brooke's rifles used the same seven-groove rifling with a right-hand twist. Most of Brooke's guns had a Gomer-style powder chamber, shaped like a truncated cone with a hemispherical tip, but the 6.4-inch rifles had a simple hemispherical powder chamber.|$|R
5000|$|The M&P/Model 10 {{has been}} {{available}} in both blued steel finish and nickel finish {{for most of its}} production run. The model has also been offered throughout the years with both the round butt and square butt, i.e., grip patterns. Beginning with the Model 10-5 series in the late 1960s, the <b>tapered</b> <b>barrel</b> and its trademark 'half moon' front sight (as shown in the illustrations on this page) were replaced by a straight bull barrel and a sloped milled ramp front sight. Late model Model 10s are capable of handling any [...]38 Special cartridge produced today up to and including +P+ rounds.|$|E
5000|$|During {{this period}} (1956-1970) a Jotter was {{introduced}} with a substantially larger diameter barrel. Most found {{to date have}} an unusual moss green barrel. Black and white versions of the large diameter Jotter have also been found. This model {{was known as the}} [...] "Industrial Jotter" [...] as opposed to the standard diameter version known as the [...] "Commercial Jotter". Parker's sales staff never liked the original Jotter because the grooves made advertising imprints on the barrel difficult, if not impossible, to print and required clip devices when sold for advertising purposes. They were pleased when the smooth barrel was introduced which appeared to allow advertising imprints. However it was then found that imprinting on the smooth <b>tapered</b> <b>barrel</b> was equally difficult due to the taper of the barrel. Subsequently the marketing department successfully lobbied for a model with a larger diameter barrel which would make it possible to easily print corporate messages. This larger diameter adversely affected the overall appearance of the pen, causing the pen to lose its svelte design. The version was not popular with the staff or customers and was discontinued (after a short period of time) when Parker solved the problem of imprinting on the original <b>tapered</b> <b>barrel.</b> These industrial versions are seldom seen and can be recognized by the sharp taper {{at the end of the}} pen barrel. When found these pens command a substantial premium over the standard Jotters of the period.|$|E
5000|$|The Ranch Rifles are {{currently}} {{the most basic}} models, generally offered in a wood or synthetic rifle stock paired with a blued or stainless steel receiver and a standard 18.5" [...] <b>tapered</b> <b>barrel</b> (1:9" [...] RH twist rate).

5000|$|The {{design was}} based on a <b>tapering</b> <b>barrel,</b> with the caliber {{reducing}} from 28 mm at the chamber end to only 20 mm at the muzzle. The projectile carried two external flanges; as it proceeded toward the muzzle, the flanges were squeezed down, decreasing the diameter with the result that pressure did not drop off as quickly and the projectile was propelled to a higher velocity. The barrel construction resulted in a very high muzzle velocity - up to 1,400 m/s. The bore was fitted with a muzzle brake. The horizontal sliding breech block was [...] "quarter-automatic": it closed automatically once a shell was loaded. The gun was equipped with an open sight for distances up to 500m; a telescopic sight, (ZF 1х11 from the 3.7 cm Pak 36 anti-tank gun), could also be fitted.|$|R
5000|$|Marlin {{offers the}} Model 1894CB lever-action rifle in [...]32 H&R Magnum. Unlike other Marlin 1894s, the 1894CB loads {{from the front}} of the tubular 10-shot magazine, like their Model 39A rimfire rifle, and has a faster, 10% shorter throw lever action. It has a 20" [...] <b>tapered</b> {{octagonal}} <b>barrel</b> and an overall length of 37.5" [...] and weighs 6.5 lbs.|$|R
25|$|A boxy, boat-shaped vehicle, the EE-9 Cascavel has a steep frontal glacis which slopes upwards {{and back}} towards the {{horizontal}} hull roof, with recesses for the headlamps and a thick glacis plate over the driver's seat. The hull sides are nearly vertical, but also sloped inwards towards the roof. There is a low, well-rounded turret on the forward section of the hull with a long, <b>tapered</b> gun <b>barrel</b> and a triple baffle muzzle brake.|$|R
50|$|Armor-piercing, {{composite}} non-rigid (APCNR) is the British {{term and}} {{known by the}} Germans as Gerlich principle weapons, but today the more commonly used terms are squeeze-bore and tapered bore; these shells {{are based on the}} same projectile design as the APCR - a high density core within a shell of soft iron or other alloy - but it is fired by a gun with a <b>tapered</b> <b>barrel,</b> either a taper in a fixed barrel or a final added section. The projectile is initially full-bore, but the outer shell is deformed as it passes through the taper. Flanges or studs are swaged down in the tapered section, so that as it leaves the muzzle the projectile has a smaller overall cross-section.|$|E
50|$|Another {{version of}} the M1919A4, the M1919A6, {{was an attempt to}} make the weapon into a light machine gun by {{attaching}} a buttstock and lighter barrel—4 lb (1.8 kg) instead of 7 lb (3.2 kg). The A6 version was in fact heavier than the A4 without its tripod, at 32 lb (15 kg), though its bipod made for faster deployment and enabled the machine gun team to dispense with one man (the tripod bearer). The A6 version saw increasing service in the latter days of World War II and was used extensively in Korea. The A6 variant had a folding bipod mounted {{on the front of the}} gun, a sheet-metal buttstock, carrying handle, and a <b>tapered</b> <b>barrel.</b> While the modifications were intended to make the weapon more useful as a squad light machine gun, it was a stopgap solution, as the M1919A6 was heavier than the old Lewis gun of World War I, let alone the contemporary light machine guns of other nations.|$|E
50|$|The rifle barrel is {{thermally}} shielded along {{a considerable}} {{part of the}} barrel by a polymer shroud. It uses a different bipod-stock configuration from its predecessor, which is built {{just ahead of the}} receiver. GIAT studies lead to a new three groove conical <b>barrel.</b> <b>Tapering</b> the <b>barrel</b> from the throat area up to the first 100 mm of the barrel and at the muzzle end reduced barrel wear caused by propellant gasses passing the projectile in the bore.It uses 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition, and is equipped with a telescopic sight, French army standard issue is either an APX L806 or SCROME J8 (Army) or Nightforce NXS (Air force) or Schmidt & Bender 6×42 mil-dot (Navy). The rifle is also issued as part of the FÉLIN infantry combat system outfitted with a Sagem Sword Sniper 3-in-1 optic, which serves as a telescopic sight, thermal weapon sight, and laser rangefinder. The FR F2 utilizes the same basic bolt design as the older MAS-36 infantry rifle. The MAS-36 bolt action was however extensively modified and strengthened to reduce accuracy inhibiting flex in the FR F1 and FR F2.|$|R
50|$|The term {{originated}} with the techniques used to aim muzzle-loading cannon. Their <b>barrels</b> <b>tapered</b> from breech to muzzle, {{so that when}} the top of the cannon was held horizontal its bore actually sat at an elevated angle. During firing, recoil caused the gun's muzzle to elevate slightly, resulting in an upward movement of the shot. This caused the projectile to rise above the natural line of sight shortly after leaving the muzzle, then drop below it after the apex of its slightly parabolic trajectory was reached.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} 19th century, Prussia began to {{standardize}} its military rifle. In 1810, {{as part of}} its strenuous effort to rebuild its army after the defeat at Jena-Auerstadt, the state officially adopted its first standard rifle, which was a combination of preferred features from previous weapons. It had a 28½" [...]58 caliber <b>tapered</b> and flared <b>barrel,</b> offering good balance. This was the only flintlock military rifle of a major military power to use set triggers, and was the first German rifle that could be fitted with a bayonet.|$|R
50|$|While {{standard}} rifle <b>barrels</b> <b>taper</b> from breech to muzzle, {{high precision}} rifles will often use a barrel with far less taper, called a heavy barrel, sometimes leaving the barrel cylindrical {{all the way}} to the muzzle, called a bull barrel. Either technique greatly increases the stiffness of the barrel by enlarging the average diameter, but this process adds significant weight as well. This can greatly increase the mass of the barrel, however; going from a lightweight sporter contour to a heavy barrel contour can double the mass, and a going to a bull barrel contour can more than triple it. Fluting, consisting of grooves machined in the outer surface of the barrel to remove material, can reduce the weight and improve heat dispersion while maintaining most of the stiffness.|$|R
