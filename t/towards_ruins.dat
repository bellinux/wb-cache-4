60|$|The man or {{the woman}} to whom {{habitual}} excitement of any kind has become essential has taken the first step <b>towards</b> <b>ruin.</b> In {{the case of a}} woman, it leads to discontent, fretfulness, and dissatisfaction with the quiet duties of domestic life; {{in the case of a}} man, it leads almost invariably to animal stimulus, ruinous alike to the powers of body and mind.|$|R

5000|$|.....all {{progress}} in capitalistic agriculture is a {{progress in}} the art, not only of robbing the labourer, but of robbing the soil; all progress in increasing the {{fertility of the soil}} for a given time, is a progress <b>towards</b> <b>ruining</b> the lasting sources of that fertility. The more a country starts its development on the foundation of modern industry, like the United States, for example, the more rapid is this process of destruction. Capitalist production, therefore, develops technology, and the combining together of various processes into a social whole, only by sapping the original sources of all wealth — the soil and the labourer.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Traveller having {{finished}} his breakfast and paid his moderate score, {{walked out to}} the threshold of the Peal of Bells, and, thence directed by the pointing finger of his host, betook himself <b>towards</b> the <b>ruined</b> hermitage of Mr. Mopes the hermit.|$|R
60|$|It is a fact, as Shakespeare has so tersely hinted, that fame {{sometimes}} {{comes in}} the line of duty. To be sure, if Austen Vane had been Timothy Smith, the Mender case might not have made quite so many ripples in the pond with which this story is concerned. Austen did what he thought was right. In the opinion of many of his father's friends whom he met from time to time he had made a good-sized stride <b>towards</b> <b>ruin,</b> and they did not hesitate to tell him so--Mr. Chipman, president of the Ripton National Bank; Mr. Greene, secretary and treasurer of the Hawkeye Paper Company, who suggested with all kindness that, however noble it may be, it doesn't pay to tilt at windmills.|$|R

60|$|Throughout {{this war}} between the king and nobles {{on one side and}} the people of England on the other there was a famous leader, who did more <b>towards</b> the <b>ruin</b> of royal {{authority}} than all the rest. The contest seemed like a wrestling-match between King Charles and this strong man. And the king was overthrown.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} counter the eminent threat Alivardi Khan rallied a Mughal Army of nearly 10,000 troops also {{consisting}} of conscripts such as Abyssinian Sailors and Georgian Qizilbash. Alivardi Khan then informed the Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah of the invasion and rode ceaselessly for almost three days <b>towards</b> the <b>ruins</b> of Bardhaman where the Marathas established occupation.|$|R
60|$|By {{no means}} in {{quiescence}} did the squire hear these charges brought against him. The Lady Arabella, in each attack, got {{quite as much}} as she gave, and, at last, was driven to retreat in a state of headache, which she declared to be chronic; and which, so she assured her daughter Augusta, must prevent her from having any more lengthened conversations with her lord--at any rate for the next three months. But though the squire may be said to have come off on the whole as victor in these combats, they did not perhaps have, on that account, the less effect upon him. He knew it was true that he had done much <b>towards</b> <b>ruining</b> his son; and he also could think of no other remedy than matrimony. It was Frank's doom, pronounced even by the voice of his father, that he must marry money.|$|R

60|$|In {{coming to}} terms with Cardinal della Rovere, Cesare made the first great mistake of his career, took the first step <b>towards</b> <b>ruin.</b> He should have known better than to have trusted such a man. He should have remembered the ancient bitter rancour; should have recognized, in the amity of later times, the amity of the self-seeker, and mistrusted it. But della Rovere had {{acquired}} a reputation for honesty and for being a man of his word. How far he deserved it you may judge from what is presently to follow. He had acquired it, however, and Cesare, to his undoing, attached faith to that reputation. He may, to some extent, have counted upon the fact that, of Cardinal della Rovere's bastard children, only a daughter--Felice della Rovere--survived. Raffaele, the last of his bastard boys, had died a year ago. Thus, Cesare may have concluded that the cardinal having no sons whose fortunes he must advance, would lack temptation to break faith with him.|$|R

Entry to the park is free of charge, however the council have recently started charging for parking. They often have special events for the children.

60|$|It was Ulpius. The Pagan {{was changed}} in bearing and countenance {{as well as}} in apparel. He stood more firm and upright; a dull, tawny hue overspread his face; his eyes, so sunken and lustreless in other days, were now {{distended}} and bright with the glare of insanity. It seemed as if his bodily powers had renewed their vigour, while his mental faculties had declined <b>towards</b> their <b>ruin.</b>|$|R
500|$|Geen was {{commissioned}} second {{lieutenant in the}} 9th Battalion, King's Royal Rifle Corps on 21 August 1914. He trained in Petworth and {{was sent to the}} Western Front in May 1915. The 9th was assigned to the 14th (Light) Division and served with it during the Second Battle of Ypres. After six weeks' combat, the battalion was withdrawn for rest but two days later was sent back to the front to reinforce the 41st Brigade. Geen was killed in action on 31 July 1915 at Hooge, Belgium. He was last seen leading his men in hand-to-hand fighting as they advanced <b>towards</b> <b>ruined</b> village buildings. Major John Hope wrote: [...] "Geen fought gloriously, and was last seen alive leading his platoon in a charge after being for hours subjected to liquid fire and every device the Germans could bring to bear to break through. Seventeen officers and 333 other ranks of this battalion were killed in this engagement, in which officers and men showed themselves worthy of the best traditions of their Regiment." ...|$|R

Soon after, Lotte (Asia Argento), the sacristan's daughter and the sole survivor of the incident, is seen walking <b>towards</b> the <b>ruins</b> of the church. She finds the seal of the crypt, opens it and peers inside. Blue light emits from within, just like when the librarian first opened it, and she smiles.|$|R
5000|$|The book {{begins with}} a prologue about how Apoletta met Zebulah, her {{previous}} husband.Zebulah, a red-robed human mage, was exploring the sunken ruins of Istar, while Apoletta was the Steward of Istar at that time, guarding it from humans. While she secretly watches him, it is mentioned that she was taken by his respectfulness, curiosity, and honesty <b>towards</b> the <b>ruins.</b> After conversing with him to discover his intent, she also becomes impressed by his truthfulness as a [...] "would-be invader".|$|R
60|$|Anton Trendellsohn {{understood}} {{well the}} meaning of the old man's threat. He was quite alive to the fact that his father had expressed his intention to give his wealth and his standing in trade and the business of his house to some younger Jew, who would be more true than his own son to the traditional customs of their tribes. There was Ruth Jacobi, his granddaughter--the only child of the house--who had already reached an age at which she might be betrothed; and there was Samuel Loth, the son of Baltazar Loth, old Trendellsohn's oldest friend. Anton Trendellsohn did not doubt who might be the adopted child to be taken to fill his place. It has been already explained that there was no partnership actually existing between the two Trendellsohns. By degrees the son had slipt into the father's place, and the business by which the house had grown rich had for the last five or six years been managed chiefly by him. But the actual results of the son's industry and the son's thrift were still in the possession of the father. The old man might no doubt go far <b>towards</b> <b>ruining</b> his son if he were so minded.|$|R
60|$|When de Garcia {{was gone}} into the pit, I turned my steps homewards, or rather <b>towards</b> the <b>ruined</b> city which I could see beneath me, for I had no home left. Now I must descend the ice cap, and this I found less easy than {{climbing}} it had been, for, my vengeance being accomplished, I became as other men are, and a sad and weary one at that, so sad indeed that I should not have sorrowed greatly if I had made a false step upon the ice.|$|R
6000|$|As Dick and {{the negro}} had both been {{making the best}} of their way <b>towards</b> the <b>ruin,</b> from the moment they {{discovered}} the situation of their friend, by this time they were within speaking distance of the spot itself. Wilder, in those brief, pithy tones that distinguish the manner in which a sea officer issues his orders, directed them to raise the ladder. When he was liberated, he demanded, with a sufficiently significant air, if they had observed the direction in which the stranger in green had made his retreat? ...|$|R
50|$|The old Nausori {{town was}} {{situated}} about 5 km north heading <b>towards</b> Kasavu. The <b>ruins</b> {{of the old}} town, situated in Naduruloulou, is still there, albeit a tourist centre and a haven for tropial flora and fauna gardens. Colonial building, town halls, local courts, grand residences can be found here dating back pre 1900's.|$|R
60|$|After about {{a quarter}} of an hour, the boat began to {{approach}} the shores of the little island. And now the great square tower, and the rampart wall connected with it, came plainly in sight. There were a few very large and old trees overhanging the ruins, {{and all the rest of}} the island was covered with a dense grove of young trees. The boat came up to the land, and Mr. George and the boys stepped out of it upon a sort of jetty, formed of stones loosely thrown together. There was a path leading through the grass, and among the trees, <b>towards</b> the <b>ruins</b> of the castle.|$|R
60|$|One {{afternoon}} {{he had taken}} her to play tennis with some friends, and afterwards they strolled on to her favourite view. Down the Toulon road gardens and hills were bathed in the colour of ripe apricot; an evening crispness had stolen on the air; the blood, released from the sun's numbing, ran gladly in the veins. On the right hand of the road was a Frenchman playing bowls. Enormous, busy, pleased, and upright as a soldier, pathetically trotting his vast carcass from end to end, he delighted Shelton. But Antonia threw a single look at the huge creature, and her face expressed disgust. She began running up <b>towards</b> the <b>ruined</b> tower.|$|R
60|$|Be this as it may; {{happening}} {{to pass a}} few days at Terracina, {{in the course of}} his researches, he one day mounted the rocky cliffs which overhang the town, to visit the castle of Theodoric. He was groping about these <b>ruins,</b> <b>towards</b> the hour of sunset, buried in his reflections,--his wits no doubt wool-gathering among the Goths and Romans, when he heard footsteps behind him.|$|R

"I should ill brook {{coming to}} harm for doing {{violence}} to {{a subject of}} the King," [...] said Reuben Ring, a steady, open-faced yeoman, who thought far less of the subtleties of his companion, than of discharging his social duties in a manner fitting {{the character of a}} quiet and well-conditioned citizen. [...] "We have had so much of stirring tidings, latterly, concerning the manner the savages conduct their warfare, that it behoveth men in place of trust to be vigilant; for," [...] glancing his eyes <b>towards</b> the <b>ruin</b> of the distant block-house, [...] "thou knowest, brother Dudley, that we have occasion to be watchful, in a settlement as deep in the forest as this." ...|$|R
50|$|The river {{runs through}} the village of North Creake, crosses under the Burnham Road and heads north across the open {{countryside}} <b>towards</b> the <b>ruins</b> of Creake Abbey. This abbey is on {{the southern edge of}} the Burnham’s, a mile or so from Burnham Thorpe. It was built {{towards the end of the}} 14th century for an Augustinian priory which had inhabited this spot since the 1220s, becoming an abbey shortly afterwards. Creake Abbey is unusual, because although it survived into the 16th century, it never suffered the effects of the Reformation or the dissolution of the monasteries. In 1508, an outbreak of plague killed virtually all the inhabitants, and it was abandoned.|$|R
5000|$|In an 1890 {{quarterly}} {{statement for}} the PEF, the ancient ruins of Hawsha {{are described as}} follows: [...] "This ruin ... {{must have been an}} important place, to judge from the mass of building stones and the fragments of columns lying about. Now that the grass is dried up a regular city wall can be traced. On the main road running from the well <b>towards</b> the <b>ruin</b> some fine capitals are lying about, which have a close resemblance to those which on other sites have been stated to be remains of synagogues. The shafts of columns lying about generally have the basis or capital worked out of the same piece, have a diameter of 18 inches, and are composed of Nari limestone." ...|$|R
60|$|She went to {{the fence}} and sat there, {{watching}} the gold clouds fall to pieces, and go in immense, rose-coloured <b>ruin</b> <b>towards</b> the darkness.
