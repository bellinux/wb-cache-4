5|$|Along {{with the}} rising {{importance}} of a central administration arose {{a new class of}} educated scribes and officials who were granted estates by the pharaoh in payment for their services. Pharaohs also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the pharaoh after his death. Scholars believe <b>that</b> <b>five</b> centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic power of the pharaoh, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration. As the power of the pharaoh diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the pharaoh. This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150BC, is assumed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, two new {{aircraft}} carriers were planned. The {{requirements for the}} intended force of four carriers meant <b>that</b> <b>five</b> squadrons of Phantoms would be needed. However, in its 1966 Defence White Paper, the Government decided to cancel the two new carriers, which led to reductions in the total order for the Royal Navy's Phantoms. Initially 143 were ordered, which was cut to 110, and finally just 50, with options for another seven. The intention was to form a pair of front-line squadrons, each of twelve aircraft, that would operate from the two remaining, heavily modernised fleet carriers. The rest of the aircraft would be a reserve and for training.|$|E
5|$|Branham {{claimed to}} have had a prophetic revelation in June, 1933 that {{comprised}} seven major events that would occur before the Second Coming of Christ. He believed <b>that</b> <b>five</b> of the seven predictions, relating to world politics, science, and the moral condition of the world, had been fulfilled. The final two visions, one related to the Roman Catholic Church gaining power in the United States and the second detailing the destruction of the United States, would be fulfilled by 1977, subsequent to which Christ would return. A comparison of Branham's descriptions of the prophecies reveals his tendency to exaggerate and embellish his actual predictions.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the first}} {{conclusive}} {{evidence that the}} Balts were uniting {{is considered to be}} the treaty with Galicia–Volhynia signed in 1219. The treaty's signatories include 21 Lithuanian dukes; it specifies <b>that</b> <b>five</b> of those were elder and thus took precedence over the remaining sixteen. Presumably, the eldest Duke was Živinbudas, since his name was mentioned first. Mindaugas, despite his youth, and his brother Dausprungas, are listed among the elder dukes. That would imply that they inherited their titles. The remaining two elder dukes were Daujotas (mentioned second) and his brother Vilikaila (mentioned last of the five).|$|E
