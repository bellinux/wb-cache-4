The model requires neither special modifications at low or high speeds nor the introduction of heterogeneities in the material properties, as previously proposed. We also demonstrate through numerical experiments of 3 ‐D ruptures that the temperature evolution can discriminate between crack‐like and slip pulses mode of propagation.

The proposed inversion for the parameters of tensile sources is based on the evaluation of the isotropic (ISO), compensated linear vector dipole (CLVD), and double-couple (DC) components in seismic moment tensors. The most significant parameters inverted are the λ/μ ratio at the fault (denoted as the κ parameter) and the inclination α of the slip vector from the fault. The κ parameter is significant for discriminating noisy moment tensors of shear earthquakes from those of tensile earthquakes. The inclination α can be accurately determined from the DC component in the moment tensor because the DC component rapidly decreases with increasing α. For example, the inclination of 20 ° causes DC being ∼ 50 – 60 % only. The inversion is applied to earthquakes which occurred in January 1997 in West Bohemia, Czech Republic. It is shown that some of these earthquakes display tensile faulting. The κ parameter is ∼ 0. 1. The inclination of the slip from the fault attains values of up to 20 °.

40|$|This report explores {{detecting}} inter-turn {{short circuit}} (ITSC) faults in surface permanent magnet synchronous machines (SPMSM). ITSC faults are caused by electrical insulation failures in the stator windings {{and can lead to}} shorts to ground and even fires. This report proposes methods for detecting these faults using a moving horizon observer (MHO) to reduce the chance of electrical shocks and fires. Specifically, this report constructs a MHO for ITSC fault detection in SPMSM. ITSC fault tolerant control is investigated for a 2004 Toyota Prius hybrid vehicle having a traction SPMSM. Once the supervisory-level powertrain power flow control becomes aware of the presence of a fault and its degree from the MHO, the control (i) reduces the maximum possible vehicle speed to ensure SPMSM thermal constraints are not violated and (ii) switches to a traction motor input-output power efficiency appropriate for the degree of fault. These steps are taken during a fault rather than shutting down the traction motor to provide a “limp home” capability. The traction motor cannot simply be turned off because its rotation is not independent of drive wheel rotation. The control is demonstrated by simulating the Prius over a 40 s drive velocity profile with faults levels of 0. 5 %, 1 %, 2 %, and 5 % detected at the midpoint of the profile. For comparison, the Prius is also simulated without a <b>traction</b> motor <b>fault.</b> Results show that the control reduced vehicle velocity upon detection of a fault to appropriate safe values. Further, the challenges of ITSC fault tolerant control for heavy hybrid vehicles are examined. This work is partially supported by the Department of Energy, Award No. DE-EE 0005568.

Numericalmodels of the processes occurring during seismogenic faulting represent a powerful tool to explore realistic scenarios that are often far from being fully reproduced in laboratory experiments because of intrinsic, technical limitations. In this paper we discuss the prominent role of the fault governing model, which describes {{the behavior of the}} <b>fault</b> <b>traction</b> during a dynamic slip failure and accounts for the different, and potentially competing, chemical and physical dissipative mechanisms. We show in a comprehensive sketch the large number of constitutive models adopted in dynamic modeling of seismic events, and we emphasize their prominent features, limitations, and specific advantages. In a quantitative comparison, we show through numerical simulations that spontaneous dynamic ruptures obeying the idealized, linear slip‐weakening (SW) equation and a more elaborated rate‐ and state‐dependent friction law produce very similar results (in terms of rupture times, peaks slip velocity, developed slip, and stress drops), provided that the frictional parameters are adequately comparable and, more importantly, that the fracture energy density is the same. Our numerical experiments also illustrate that the different models predict fault slip velocity time histories characterized by a similar frequency content; a feeble predominance of high frequencies in the SW case emerges in the frequency ranges [0. 3, 1] and [11, 50] Hz. These simulations clearly indicate that, even forgiving the frequency band limitation, {{it would be very difficult}} (virtually impossible) to discriminate between two different, but energetically identical, constitutive models, on the basis of the seismograms recorded after a natural earthquake...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{propose a}} fourth-order staggered-grid finite-difference method to study dynamic {{faulting}} in three dimensions. The method uses an {{implementation of the}} boundary conditions on the fault that allows the use of general friction models including slip weakening and rate dependence. Because the staggered-grid method defines stresses and particle velocities at different grid points, we preserve symmetry by implementing a two-grid-row &quot;thick &quot; fault zone. Slip is computed between points located at {{the borders of the}} fault zone, while the two components of shear <b>traction</b> on the <b>fault</b> are forced to be symmetric inside the fault zone. We study the properties of the numerical method comparing our simulations with well-known properties of seismic ruptures in 3 D. Among the properties that are well modeled by our method are full elastic-wave interactions, frictional instability, rupture initiation from a finite initial patch, spontaneous rupture growth at subsonic and supersonic speeds, as well as healing by either stopping phases or rate-dependent friction. We use this method for simulating spontaneous rupture propagation along an arbitrarily loaded planar fault starting from a localized asperity on circular and rectangular faults. The shape of the rupture front is close to elliptical and is systematically elongated in the in-plane direction of traction drop. This elongation is due to the presence of a strong shear stress peak that moves ahead of the rupture in the in-plane direction. At high initial stresses the rupture front becomes unstable and jumps to super-shear speeds in the direction of in-plane shear. Another interesting effect is the development of relatively narrow rupture fronts due to the presence of rate-weakening friction. The solutions for the &quot;thick fault &quot; boundary conditions scale with the slip-weakening distance (Do) and are stable and reproducible for Do greater than about 4 in terms of 2 T,//. t × Ax. Finally, a comparison of scalar and vector boundary conditions for the friction shows that slip is dominant along the direction of the prestress, with the largest deviations in slip-rate direction occurring near the rupture front and the edges of the fault...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{radiated}} waves emitted by events on a model fault. The model deterministically produces a complex sequence of events, {{with a wide}} range of sizes, from a uniform frictional instability. The spontaneous rupture events emit a rich spectrum of radiated waves as they nucleate, propagate, and decelerate within the complex stress field left by previous events. Two model innovations, a new driving boundary condition on the fault and a new radiating boundary condition which allows a spatially varying prestress away from the fault, allow us to directly measure the radiation without problems from boundary reflections in our two-dimensional model. We quantify the radiation by first measuring the energy spectral density and then averaging over events of a similar size to examine the magnitude dependence. Assuming only a physics of the <b>tractions</b> on the <b>fault,</b> we obtain a full spectra of radiated waves for a complex population of events {{with a wide range}} of sizes. To quantify the resulting spectra, we consider two different spectral measures. One, the peak amplitude of the spectral energy density, occurs at a period which scales with the rupture length and corresponds with the classical corner frequency measurement. The other, the peak amplitude of the spectral average acceleration or the low-frequency corner in the case of a flat acceleration spectrum, occurs at a period that scales with the duration of slip of points on the fault. The period of the peak spectral acceleration saturates for large events. Looking at the rupture motions on the fault, we find that this spectral behavior corresponds with the behavior of slip pulses in the model. Intense narrow pulses of slip develop for very long rupture events. We quantify this by measuring the mean slip duration as a function of rupture length and show that it is has the same behavior as the peak period of spectral acceleration. Thus the duration of the slip pulses in these ruptures is directly expressed in their radiated spectra. Moreover, we find that these corner periods exhibit a nontrivial dependence on event magnitude for the different frictional instabilities that we have examined, suggesting that any observed dependence of these corner periods on earthquake magnitude might provide insight into the frictional instability of earthquakes...|$|R

Therefore, it {{is critically important}} that we seek to more fully understand the physics of the combined earthquake-tsunami system. One way to address this goal is through numerical modeling. The work discussed herein focuses on combining dynamic earthquake and tsunami models {{through the use of}} the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Finite Difference Method (FDM). Dynamic earthquake models ac- count for the force that the entire fault system exerts on each individual element of the model for each time step, so that earthquake rupture takes a path based on the physics of the model; dynamic tsunami models can incorporate water height variations to produce water wave formation, propagation, and inundation. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to some important concepts and equations of elastodynamics and fluid dynamics as well as a brief example of the FEM. In Chapter 2, we investigate the 3 -D effects of realistic fault dynamics on slip, free surface deformation, and resulting tsunami formation from an Mw 9 megathrust earthquake offshore Southern Alaska. Corresponding tsunami models, which use a FDM to solve linear long-wave equations, match sea floor deformation, in time, to the free surface deformation from the rupture simulations. Tsunamis generated in this region could have large adverse effects on Pacific coasts. In Chapter 3, we construct a 3 -D dynamic rupture model of an earthquake on a reverse fault structure offshore Southern California to model the resulting tsunami, with a goal of elucidating the seismic and tsunami hazard in this area. The corresponding tsunami model uses final seafloor displacements from the rupture model as initial conditions to compute local propagation and inundation, resulting in large peak tsunami amplitudes northward and eastward due to site and path effects. In Chapter 4, we begin to evaluate 2 -D earthquake source parameters from characteristics of the Rayleigh-wave field by running a suite of 2 -D dynamic rupture models on thrust/reverse faults that vary in dip angle and fault curvature, and with equivalent prestress conditions such as constant <b>traction</b> across the <b>fault</b> or variable prestress distributions.

40|$|International audienceSummary: A {{material}} {{interface condition}} {{based on the}} RCCM law {{is used as a}} boundary condition for seismic rupture to mimic damage in the fault zone. This constitutive law may provide quasi-stable solutions and variable nucleation lengths {{as a function of the}} loading and the thickness of the damaged layer. IntroductionEarthquake rupture is classically modeled as a friction-dominated process, where friction arises from the roughness of the contact between the two sides of a fault. During the metastable nucleation and the dynamic rupture phases, the <b>traction</b> on the <b>fault</b> decreases reflecting a weakening of the interface. Seismological observations show that this traction evolution can be represented as a simple slip weakening process, where the traction drops to its final value over a critical slip weakening distance, usually referred to as Dc. The simplest phenomenological model is a linear slip weakening friction law (LSW) [1], with a fixed slip weakening rate and fracture energy release between the static and the dynamic friction states. The nucleation length associated to this law is universal [2] and can hardly account for the occurrence of both small and large earthquakes. The friction dissipation does not depend on the dynamics but is rather a mechanical property, which appears to be strongly scale-dependent as suggested when comparing seismological and laboratory observations. Laboratory experiments on rocks sliding in steady-state conditions have shown a more complex evolution where the traction on the interface depends on the slip and slip velocity, as well as other interface state parameters that govern both the weakening and the healing phases. A classical example of these rate-and-state friction laws is the Dietrich-Ruina law [3] Where is the friction coefficient, v is the slip rate, a and b are constant parameters, and the * points to a reference state. The state variable  obeys an ageing law, associated with of the time evolution of the population of contacts along the sliding interface, including a healing process. Depending on the sign of a-b, the friction law can exhibit either a weakening (a-b 0) behavior [4]. Rate-and-state friction laws allow modeling the evolution of the fault interface during seismic cycles, i. e., loading-and-rupture cycles. A fault interface is not however a zero-order surface discontinuity. Even though slip during an earthquake is localized along a thin layer, and the rupture propagates along very large distance, fault interfaces appear as a highly heterogeneous damaged shear zone produced by the repeated occurrence of earthquakes along that interface. Surface (friction) and volume (damage) dissipation are therefore contributing to the energy release during a seismic rupture. Since the wavelength associated with seismic observations is significantly larger than the width of the fault zone, it is generally believed that an interface constitutive law remains a valid phenomenological description as a result of an implicit homogenization of the dissipation processes within the interface. In this framework, we explore here seismological implications of the RCCM (Raous-Cangemi-Cocu-Monerie) interface law [5] and the differences with classical linear slip weakening, for both the rupture nucleation and dynamics phases. A material interfaceWe assume a fault zone with thickness h in a 2 D in-plane geometry and homogeneous properties in the direction parallel to the fault. The fault zone is described as a material interface. The interface dissipation results both from the interface damage weakening and the friction mobilization. We define a state variable  that describes the damage evolution. ranges between 0 and 1 :  indicating a cohesive interface and  a completely damage interface respectively. We assume a partition of the traction into a reversible and an irreversible contribution as a linear function of . The former corresponds to the traction elastically stored by the interface which can be given back during a quasi-static discharge. The latter contribution is associated to the irreversible friction. Separating also the energy into a reversible elastic part and an irreversible contribution related to the dissipation and written in a Dupré form, we come out with a particular slip weakening relationship, hereinafter indicated as RCCM: In this relation,  is the tangential traction, n is the normal traction, d the dynamic friction coefficient, u is the slip, 1 / 2 w is the energy stored by the layer and u is the yield level which can be written as, where Ct is the interface stiffness. The traction evolution exhibits a non linear behavior with slip, with a power law decay at the beginning, a minimum which depends on both the energy stored by the interface and the stiffness Ct, and a final asymptotic value related to the dynamic friction (Figure 1). Equating the elastic energy stored by the interface to the energy associated to a deformation of the layer we retrieve that the stiffness of the interface is Where is the harmonic mean of the shear modulus. The smaller the layer thickness is, the larger the stiffness of the interface is, and the larger the stored elastic energy is before dynamic rupture instability. When comparing the RCCM traction-slip evolution with the Traction-slip evolutions inferred from earthquake kinematic rupture inversion models [6], we retrieve a yield traction of the order of 10 - 15 MPa and a thickness of the fault zone of about one hundred meters, which is comparable with the size of the damaged zone observed on exhumed faults. Figure 1 : Traction evolution with slip for the RCCM law NucleationDuring the nucleation phase, the fault interface evolves quasi-statically under slow time-increasing remote loading condition. The quasi-static equilibrium equation relates the stress and the space derivative of the slip by the Hilbert transform:  0 is the initial stress, G* the reduced shear modulus, i. e., G/(1 -), with  the Poisson coefficient. Finally a(t) is half the length of the evolving slip zone. We assume a peaked-shape of the traction, with the maximum value at the yield level. As the remote load continuously increases with time, the slip zone is extending with time. To solve the quasi-static equation together with the interface law, we seek for a finite development of the slip function onto a Chebyshev polynomial basis. A unique solution is possible if we additionally impose the finiteness condition for the traction at the boundaries of the crack [2]. For linear slip-weakening friction law, the development leads to a linear system, which can be iteratively solved for different values of the crack length. For non-linear interface law, a perturbation approach can be used leading to solve both for the slip function and the crack size at each time t, when the solution is known at time t-t. When the time step is small, we can linearize the interface law around the solution found at the previous step, and iterate using a Newton-Raphson method, to obtain the solution at the following time step. In Figure 2, the slip and the traction space-time evolutions during the nucleation phase, in the case of the RCCM interface law, are illustrated up to the onset of the dynamic instability. The slip and traction evolutions for both the RCCM and the LSW laws exhibit similar behavior beside some important differences. For the RCCM law, the nucleation depends on the shape of the remote loading, in particular the width of the loading function. The larger the loading is, the smaller the nucleation length becomes. The nucleation length depends on the slope of the interface law at zero slip. The LSW universal nucleation length is found to be a lower asymptotic limit for the RCCM nucleation length, when comparing both LSW and RCCM laws with same weakening rates at yield, as a result of possible smaller RCCM stress drop when the slip increases. Since the weakening rate scales with the interface stiffness in the case of the RCCM law, the larger the stiffness is the smaller the nucleation length becomes. The RCCM law allows therefore the occurrence of a wide range of earthquake sizes, depending on the thickness of the damaged layer. Small earthquakes could be associated with less matured fault interfaces of smaller damaged width, while large earthquakes would be related with more matured fault interfaces of larger width. Finally, for well-peaked remote loading function, stable quasi-static solutions can be extended even for large external loading, indicating that in some cases slipping zones can accommodate remote loading without evolving into a dynamic rupture. Figure 2 : Slip (left) and traction (right) as functions of space and time up to the triggering of the dynamic rupture. Dynamic rupture propagationWe finally investigate the propagation of a seismic rupture with the RCCM law and compare it to the results obtained with a LSW law. Comparison is done assuming either the same slip critical distance Dc, or the same breakdown energy. We numerically solve the elastodynamic radiation within an elastic unbounded medium using a non-smooth spectral element method [7]. The dynamic rupture is solved using the non-smooth contact condition method. Specifically, we solve iteratively a Signorini criterion for the normal traction and a modified Coulomb criterion for the tangential traction. The initial condition is prescribed consistently as a perturbation of the traction profile obtained at the onset of the dynamic instability using the nucleation analysis described previously. We assume a peaked function for the tectonic loading and we investigate the supershear generation as a function of the strength parameter on the fault and the width of the loading function. The strength parameter is the ratio between the stress required to reach the yield level u, from the initial condition  0, and the stress drop, that is the difference between the initial and final stress d level on the fault. This parameter controls the asymptotic rupture speed. As in the LSW case, two modes of supershear rupture are found: a crack mode and a pulse mode, with no major differences for the same selection of parameters. Since the cohesive zone shrinks when the rupture progresses, both the LSW and RCCM ruptures tend to have the same singular behavior. However, due to the higher energy dissipation of the RCCM law, related to the damage processes of the interface, the distance from the nucleation at which supershear occurs is significantly increased compared to the LSW case. Damage processes tend to delay the onset of supershear, and make it less unlikely than in the case of a LSW rupture. Finally, when looking at the radiation field, high frequencies are strongly attenuated in the case of the RCCM law compared to the LSW law, with differences in amplitude which can be as high as one order of magnitude in the directive quadrant. This result still remains to be confronted with seismological observations. References[1]Y. Ida. Cohesive force across the tip of a longitudinal shear crack and Griffith’s specific surface energy. J.
