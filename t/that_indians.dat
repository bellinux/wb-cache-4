5|$|In 1906, {{when the}} British {{declared}} {{war against the}} Zulu Kingdom in Natal, Gandhi at age 36, sympathised with the Zulus, and encouraged the Indian volunteers to help as an ambulance unit. He argued <b>that</b> <b>Indians</b> should participate in the war efforts to change attitudes and perceptions of the British people against the coloured people. Gandhi, a group of 20 Indians and black people of South Africa volunteered as a stretcher-bearer corps to treat wounded British soldiers and {{the opposite side of}} the war: Zulu victims.|$|E
5|$|Major Francis L. Dade, {{military}} commandant at Key West, received {{intelligence that}} Cuba and Spain were arming the Indians; investigations did not confirm the rumor. Reports coming from Fort Brooke, near present-day Tampa, noted <b>that</b> <b>Indians</b> {{in the area}} were resisting orders {{from the federal government}} to emigrate to Mississippi, contradicting the assertions made by the federal authorities that the Indians had agreed to emigrate peacefully. Dade, two companies of soldiers, and all of the available arms were sent to Fort Brooke at Tampa Bay, the port designated for the commencement of the Indians' emigration. The Indians answered by concentrating all of their forces in the New River region. On December 28, 1835, Dade and 107soldiers were ambushed en route from Tampa Bay to Fort King, near present-day Ocala. Only three soldiers survived; the attackers lost only three men.|$|E

5|$|The {{massacre}} and Gandhi's non-violent {{response to}} it moved many, but also made some Sikhs and Hindus upset that Dyer was getting away with murder. Investigation committees were formed by the British, which Gandhi asked Indians to boycott. The unfolding events, the massacre and the British response, led Gandhi to the belief <b>that</b> <b>Indians</b> will never get a fair equal treatment under British rulers, and he shifted his attention to Swaraj or self rule and political independence for India. In 1921, Gandhi {{was the leader of}} the Indian National Congress. He reorganised the Congress. With Congress now behind him, and Muslim support triggered by his backing the Khilafat movement to restore the Caliph in Turkey, Gandhi had the political support and the attention of the British Raj.|$|E
5|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asians and break Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States in general. In the process, she became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series. She revealed that when she was in school , she never saw anyone on television who looked like her, and she found it really weird because she thought there were so many people of South Asian descent in America and {{in other parts of the}} world. She also revealed that she did not want to be a stereotype of what Indians were usually seen as in global pop culture, saying <b>that</b> <b>Indians</b> never talk like Apu from The Simpsons. After signing the deal and being given all the 26 pilot scripts that ABC was developing for the 2015–2016 television season, Chopra chose Quantico. Having appeared in over fifty films at that time, the series was also Chopra's first ever audition, which she found very new and nerve-wracking at the same time.|$|E

40|$|By {{comparing}} the HRM practices in Indian and European MNE subsidiaries located {{in four of}} the Southern African Development Community countries, this paper tests the relevance of the country of origin effect and analyses the strength of institutional and firm level influences. Examining data from 865 MNE subsidiaries obtained from the World Bank enterprise survey data, the paper finds <b>that</b> <b>Indian</b> MNEs have higher labour costs in relation to total sales than their European counterparts, <b>that</b> <b>Indian</b> MNEs make more use of temporary labour than their European counterparts, <b>that</b> <b>Indian</b> MNEs invest in less training than their European counterparts. No support is found for the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>Indian</b> MNEs have a lower ratio of skilled workers in comparison to European-owned subsidiaries. The study shows that country of origin effects are weakened if they are not consistent with host country ideology and that as economies evolve so too do their expectations of HR policy and practices...|$|R

25|$|The {{battle was}} the result of General Carleton's belief <b>that</b> <b>Indians</b> were {{responsible}} for the continuing attacks on settlers along the Santa Fe Trail. He wanted to punish them and brought in Carson to do the job. With most of the Army engaged elsewhere during the American Civil War, the protection the settlers sought was almost nonexistent. Carson led 260 cavalry, 75 infantry, and 72 Ute and Jicarilla Apache Army scouts. In addition, he had two mountain howitzer cannons.|$|E
25|$|The {{soldiers}} {{supervised the}} construction of the Presidios (forts) and were responsible for keeping order and preventing and/or capturing runaway Indians that tried to leave the missions. Nearly all of the Indians adjoining the missions were induced to join the various missions built in California. Once the Indians had joined the mission, if they tried to leave, soldiers were sent out to retrieve them. In the 1830s, Richard Henry Dana, Jr. observed <b>that</b> <b>Indians</b> were regarded and treated as slaves by the Spanish-speaking Californios.|$|E

25|$|Melgarejo {{started a}} {{formidable}} assault on Indian communal land, ostensibly {{in order to}} improve agricultural production. He decreed <b>that</b> <b>Indians</b> cold become owners of their parcels if they paid a large fee within sixty days. If they failed to do so, their land would be auctioned off. The resulting land sales increased the size of the haciendas, and massive Indian uprisings against his rule became more violent. Opposition against Melgarejo mounted in all sectors of society as the term melgarejismo came to signify amoral militarism; in 1871 he was overthrown and later murdered in Lima.|$|E
25|$|Although it is {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>Indians</b> grew several native plants such as gourds and chenopods at very early dates, the first evidence of maize cultivation in the Southwest dates from about 2100 BCE. Small, primitive maize cobs have been found at five different sites in New Mexico and Arizona. The climatic range of the sites is wide as they range from the Tucson basin in the Arizona desert, at an elevation of 700m (2300ft), to a rocky cave on the Colorado plateau at 2200m (7200ft). That suggests that the primitive maize they grew was already adapted to being grown in both hot and dry and short-season climates.|$|E

25|$|The Carlisle Summer Outing Program {{arranged}} {{for students to}} work in homes as domestic servants or in farms or businesses during the summer.

Many students worked in the homes and farms of Quaker families in eastern Pennsylvania and surrounding states. Some were sent to farms in the Pennsylvania Dutch Country of Dauphin, Lancaster, and Lebanon counties and acquired what would be a lifelong Pennsylvania Dutch accent.|$|E
25|$|Chinese {{women were}} scarce in every place where Chinese indentured laborers were brought, the {{migration}} {{was dominated by}} Chinese men. Up to the 1940s men made up {{the vast majority of}} the Costa Rican Chinese community. Males made up the majority of the original Chinese community in Mexico and they married Mexican women. One stark difference between Indian and Chinese Coolies was the treatment of women, despite both groups having a severe shortage. Though there were crimes against women and women being murdered, these incidents were nowhere near as frequent as with Indian Coolies. Though this was because there were so few Chinese, it became common for people to believe <b>that</b> <b>Indians</b> murder their women while Chinese women stay alive because, unlike their Indian counterparts, they are chaste.|$|E
30|$|This study {{compared}} U.S. and Indian engineering students’ use of {{metacognitive strategies}} and their epistemic beliefs about text in academic settings. It {{is the first}} study of its kind {{to address the question}} of whether non-native speaking engineering students are inherently disadvantaged in information literacy and, by implication, in the global workplace. The hypothesis, motivated by findings in the published literature, was <b>that</b> <b>Indian</b> students, for whom English is not a native language, would be challenged by processing information in English. The results confirmed the hypothesis <b>that</b> <b>Indian</b> engineering students would apply pragmatic processing strategies more frequently than U.S. students. This result is consistent with the data in Vianty (2007), Razi (2010), and Hayati and Shariatifar (2009) concerning information processing in a non-native language. Pragmatic strategies are used to extract, organize, and retain basic information. It is plausible <b>that</b> <b>Indian</b> students rely more heavily on pragmatic strategies than U.S. students, in part, to compensate for reading outside their native language. The remaining hypotheses were not confirmed. The results showed <b>that</b> <b>Indian</b> students exceeded U.S. students in the use of analytic processing strategies. They also exceeded U.S. students in the affirmation of transaction beliefs. These latter effects implied <b>that</b> <b>Indian</b> students were more likely than U.S. students to actively process information through the application of metacognitive strategies, and to interpret, evaluate, critique, and respond to information, rather than simply accept information on the authority of the author.|$|R
