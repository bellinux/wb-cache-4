5|$|Robinson again {{assumed the}} {{position}} as Speaker of the Senate on August 16, 1862 {{as part of}} a political deal to effect the resignation of Governor Beriah Magoffin. Magoffin's lieutenant governor, Linn Boyd, had died in office in 1859, and Magoffin was unwilling to allow John Fisk, then Senate Speaker and next in line for <b>the</b> <b>governorship,</b> to succeed him. Magoffin agreed to resign if the Senate would elect Robinson as Speaker, putting him next in line for <b>the</b> <b>governorship.</b> This was done, and at 10:00am on August 18, 1862, Robinson succeeded Magoffin upon the latter's resignation. Because he never resigned from the Senate, Robinson technically held both his legislative seat and <b>the</b> <b>governorship</b> concurrently.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} {{function is}} {{to serve as a}} successor to <b>the</b> <b>governorship</b> should it become vacant, or act as governor if necessary. If a lieutenant governor should succeed to <b>the</b> <b>governorship,</b> the office of lieutenant governor and President of the Senate become vacant; the duties are taken over by the Senate President pro tempore.|$|E
5|$|During the election, Romney {{contributed more}} than $6million– a state record at the time– to the nearly $10million raised for his {{campaign}} overall. On November 5, 2002, he won <b>the</b> <b>governorship,</b> earning 50percent {{of the vote}} to O'Brien's 45percent.|$|E
50|$|Eleven of {{the fifty}} United States {{governors}} were up for re-election, as were <b>the</b> <b>governorships</b> of two U.S. territories. The final results were a net change of zero between the political parties. The Democrats picked up <b>the</b> <b>governorships</b> in Montana and New Hampshire, but the Republicans {{picked up the}} ones in Indiana and Missouri.|$|R

5|$|Metcalfe {{resigned}} {{his seat}} in the House on June 1, 1828 in order to run for <b>the</b> <b>governorship</b> of Kentucky. He {{was chosen as the}} candidate of the National Republican Party at their nominating convention and was the first gubernatorial candidate in the state to be chosen using this method. He defeated William T. Barry by a margin of 709 votes, but his running mate, Joseph R. Underwood, was badly defeated by the Democratic-Republican nominee, John Breathitt. Metcalfe's election in 1828 marked the first time <b>the</b> <b>governorship</b> had been won by a candidate who was not a Democratic-Republican. However, only one Democratic-Republican would hold the office between Metcalfe's term and the election of Lazarus W. Powell in 1851.|$|E
5|$|An early {{governor}} of Gaza Sanjak was Kara Shahin Mustafa, a former jannissary (member {{of a military}} corps) who rose to become an elite military officer and state minister and eventually a vizier and trusted aide of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. He received <b>the</b> <b>governorship</b> of Gaza apparently as an interim appointment before he was appointed Governor of Egypt, although he was deposed three years later by Sultan Selim II. Mustafa died {{a short while later}} and his son Ridwan Pasha, who was the treasurer of Yemen, became governor shortly before Mustafa's death. The Ridwan dynasty, which would rule Gaza for over a century, derives its name from Ridwan Pasha. He was later appointed Governor of Yemen, but was deposed two years later and returned to <b>the</b> <b>governorship</b> of Gaza. After becoming {{governor of}} Ethiopia, Basra, and Diyarbakir in that order, he successfully led an Ottoman contingent against Safavid Persia in 1579. The sultan then awarded him the province of Anatolia where he died in 1585.|$|E

50|$|In retrospect, Coon {{appears to}} have been {{something}} of a Republican transitional figure between <b>the</b> <b>governorships</b> of Winthrop Rockefeller (1967-1971) and the later Mike Huckabee (1994-2007).|$|R
5|$|Bush {{declared}} his candidacy for the 1994 Texas gubernatorial election {{at the same}} time that his brother Jeb sought <b>the</b> <b>governorship</b> of Florida.

5|$|Despite {{the major}} success of {{capturing}} Syracuse, the Muslim province in Sicily now degenerated into internal strife. Soon after the city's fall, Ja'far ibn Muhammad {{was murdered by}} his own slaves, at the instigation of his uncle and his brother, who then usurped <b>the</b> <b>governorship.</b> They were in turn overthrown in September 878, and sent to Ifriqiya where they were executed.|$|E
5|$|In 1816, Slaughter {{was again}} {{elected to the}} post of {{lieutenant}} governor over Richard Hickman and James Garrard. George Madison was elected governor without opposition. Madison died October 14, 1816, and Slaughter ascended to <b>the</b> <b>governorship.</b> This {{was the first time}} a sitting governor had died in office in Kentucky, and some questioned the legality of Slaughter's status in the position.|$|E
50|$|Elections will be {{held for}} <b>the</b> <b>governorships</b> of 11 U.S. states and two U.S. territories. Special {{elections}} may be held for vacancies in the other states and territories, if required by respective state/territorial constitutions.|$|R

In the second round <b>the</b> <b>governorships</b> of 12 states and the Federal District were defined. This election was marked by the use of voting machines for the first time ever. They would have been used in all municipalities two years later, in the 2000 local elections.|$|R

He later wrote and published British Military History in South America.|$|E
5|$|James Turner Morehead (May 24, 1797 – December 28, 1854) was a United States Senator and the 12th Governor of Kentucky.

5|$|A poorly educated but {{politically}} astute lawyer, Taylor began {{climbing the}} political ladder by holding local offices {{in his native}} Butler County. Though he was a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, divisions in the majority party resulted in his election as Attorney General of Kentucky on a ticket with the Commonwealth's first Republican governor, William O. Bradley. Four years later, Taylor was elected in 1899 to <b>the</b> <b>governorship.</b>|$|E
5|$|Abu Firas further {{reports that}} Husayn was offered <b>the</b> <b>governorship</b> of Fars, but refused, and {{returned}} to Baghdad. Ibn al-Furat, who probably still mistrusted his intentions, promptly dispatched him to <b>the</b> <b>governorship</b> of the Diyar Rabi'a, the province encompassing the eastern Jazira, including Mosul. From this post, Husayn led a raiding campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 913/4. Soon after, however, an open rift developed between Husayn and the vizier Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah. The reason is unclear, but revolved around the finances of Husayn's province. In 914/5 he rose in open rebellion, assembling a force of 30,000 Arabs and Kurds in the Jazira, a testament to his influence there. He managed to defeat a caliphal army sent against him, but when confronted by the redoubtable Mu'nis al-Khadim, recalled from Egypt, he was defeated and captured in February 916 while trying to flee north into Armenia. He was brought to Baghdad, where he was publicly paraded across the city in ritual humiliation, riding a camel and wearing a cap of shame. He was put into prison, and executed in October/November 918 on the caliph's orders.|$|E
50|$|In April 1924 he {{was rewarded}} with <b>the</b> {{military}} <b>governorship</b> of Jilin province, which he retained until December 1928. He also held <b>the</b> civil <b>governorship</b> of <b>the</b> province in the same time, except for the time between December 1924 and June 1927.|$|R
50|$|The {{most senior}} {{overseas}} positions {{were those of}} the colonial Governors, of whom there were about forty in the 1930s. These posts were usually filled for five year periods, with appointments being made from officers who were no older than 55 (the usual retirement age being 60). <b>The</b> <b>governorships</b> were divided into four grades, according to the size and economic or political importance of the colony concerned. <b>The</b> colonial <b>governorships</b> of Gibraltar, Malta, and Bermuda, were reserved for senior naval or military officers.|$|R
50|$|On January 11, 1780, Empress Catherine the Great {{issued a}} decree of the {{establishment}} of <b>the</b> Saratov <b>governorship</b> of <b>the</b> northern districts of the Astrakhan Governorate to begin on November 7 of that year, followed by a decree on who will lead <b>the</b> new <b>governorship.</b>|$|R
5|$|After {{his victory}} over the Turgesh, Asad sent an {{expedition}} against Badr Tarkhan, possibly a prince of Bamiyan in Ghur, who had {{taken advantage of the}} turmoil of the previous year and captured Khuttal. The expedition was successful, and Khuttal returned to Arab rule. A short while later, in February 738, Asad died at Balkh after a brief illness. Ja'far ibn Hanzala al-Bahrani succeeded him temporarily until, in July, Nasr ibn Sayyar was named to <b>the</b> <b>governorship.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beshear faced no {{opposition}} in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, held on May 17, 2011. In the Republican primary, Senate President David Williams defeated Louisville businessman Phil Moffett, {{a favorite of the}} Tea Party Movement, and Bobbie Holsclaw, county clerk of Jefferson County. Perennial candidate Gatewood Galbraith sought <b>the</b> <b>governorship</b> as an Independent after collecting the requisite 5,000 signatures from registered voters requesting that his name be added to the ballot.|$|E
5|$|Bradley's {{election}} in 1895 had {{marked the first}} time in Kentucky's history that the Commonwealth had elected a Republican governor. Angry Democrats, who had controlled <b>the</b> <b>governorship</b> since the fall of the Whig Party, sought to regain what they had lost. Bitter divisions in the party led to a contentious convention that nominated William Goebel as the party candidate. A faction of the Democratic Party held a second nominating convention and chose former governor John Y. Brown as their nominee.|$|E
50|$|Thereafter Khaz'al assumed his {{position}} as Sheikh of Mohammerah, proclaiming himself not only {{the leader of the}} Bani Kaab, but also the ruler of the entire province.

The party also obtained 23 Municipal mayors.|$|R
50|$|Samuel Allen, a {{businessman}} who had acquired the Mason claims, was appointed the first governor under the 1691 charter. He was equally unsuccessful in pursuing the Mason land claims, {{and was replaced}} in 1699 by the Earl of Bellomont. Bellomont {{was the first in}} a series of governors who ruled both New Hampshire and the Province of Massachusetts Bay. Until 1741 <b>the</b> <b>governorships</b> were shared, with the governor spending most of his time in Massachusetts. As a result, the lieutenant governors held significant power. <b>The</b> dual <b>governorship</b> became problematic in part because of territorial claims between Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Since the southern border of the original Mason grant was the Merrimack River, and the Massachusetts charter specified a boundary three miles north of the same river, the claims conflicted, and were eventually brought to the king's attention. In 1741, King George II decreed what is now the border between Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and separated <b>the</b> <b>governorships,</b> issuing a commission to Benning Wentworth as New Hampshire governor.|$|R
