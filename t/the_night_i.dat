500|$|In [...] "Masterpiece", Madonna sings {{about the}} pain of being {{in love with someone}} who is a great work of art, with the lyrics {{including}} [...] "If you were the Mona Lisa, You'd be hanging in the Louvre, Everyone would come to see you, You'd be impossible to move." [...] Madonna said the song describes Wallis Simpson and is [...] "about a woman who has fallen in love with this untouchable thing, this man that was raised to be king. One of the lines of the song 'it must be so hard to always be the chosen one.' At {{the end of the day}} nothing is indestructible, no matter how high you might rise in the world you are still a human being." [...] Marc Schneider from Billboard described [...] "Masterpiece" [...] as a slowed-down, moody ballad that showcases strong execution of vocals from Madonna. He described the production as [...] "simple, direct and reminiscent of her sound in the 1990s". The lyrics were described as emotional, and was comparable to the film's love story, with the chorus as follows: [...] "And I'm right by your side, Like a thief in <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> <b>I</b> stand in front of a masterpiece. And I can't tell you why it hurts so much to be in love with a masterpiece. 'Cause after all, nothing's indestructible".|$|E

I was sitting there like, [...] "No the fuck this nigga did not....." [...] I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted...|$|E

2500|$|Cooper's dream {{at the end}} of {{the third}} episode, which became a driving plot point in the series's first season and {{ultimately}} held the key to the identity of Laura's murderer, was never scripted. The idea came to Lynch one afternoon after touching the side of a hot car left out in the sun: [...] "I was leaning against a car—the front of me was leaning against this very warm car. My hands were on the roof and the metal was very hot. The Red Room scene leapt into my mind. 'Little Mike' was there, and he was speaking backwards... For the rest of <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>I</b> thought only about The Red Room." [...] The footage was originally shot along with the pilot, to be used as the conclusion were it to be released as a feature film. When the series was picked up, Lynch decided to incorporate some of the footage; in the third episode, Cooper, narrating the dream, outlines the shot footage which Lynch did not incorporate, such as Mike shooting Bob and the fact that he is 25 years older when he meets Laura Palmer's spirit.|$|E
