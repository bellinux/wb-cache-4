5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} values is a focus on hands-on learning. The program emphasizes use of experiential learning activities in the context of outdoor education. These help participants retain what they learn about leadership generally and the eleven leadership competencies specifically. For example, participant <b>teams</b> <b>can</b> be challenged to build foot bridges, complete a hike, build a Tyrolean Traverse, cook a meal, or other practical challenges.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the NBA {{agreed with}} the National Basketball Players' Association to limit drafts to two rounds, an {{arrangement}} that has remained the same up the present time. Before each draft, an NBA Draft Lottery determines the first round selection order for the teams that missed the playoffs during the prior season. <b>Teams</b> <b>can</b> also trade their picks, which means that in some drafts teams may have {{more or less than}} two draft picks, although they must have at least one first-round pick every other year.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to terraforming, optimizing individual base performance and building secret projects, players may also benefit their factions through social engineering, probe teams, and diplomacy. Social engineering modifies the ideologically based bonuses and penalties {{forced by the}} player's choice of faction. Probe <b>teams</b> <b>can</b> sabotage and steal information, units, technology, and energy from enemy bases, while diplomacy lets the player create coalitions with other factions. It also allows the trade or transfer of units, bases, technology and energy. The Planetary Council, similar to the United Nations Security Council, takes Planet-wide actions and determines population victories.|$|E

5|$|Local {{multiplayer}} {{allows the}} player to select which teams {{participate in the}} battle {{as well as the}} number of worms and handicaps, which options and weapons are used, and the level to be played on. The matches can use any combination of human and computer teams, provided at least one team is human. Additionally, multiple worm <b>teams</b> <b>can</b> form an alliance for the match by selecting the same team color – they will still operate separately in movement rotation but share weapons and score. If multiple human players are using the same computer, the game functions in a hotseat mode.|$|E
5|$|The Orlando Magic first {{participated in}} the National Basketball Association (NBA) Draft on June 27, 1989, about five months before their inaugural NBA season. The NBA agreed with the National Basketball Players' Association to limit drafts to two rounds from 1989 onward. Before each draft, an NBA draft lottery determines the first round {{selection}} order for the teams that missed the playoffs during the prior season. <b>Teams</b> <b>can</b> also trade their picks, so some years a team could have more than or less than two picks.|$|E
5|$|The Toronto Raptors {{have made}} 34 National Basketball Association (NBA) draft {{selections}} during their draft history. The Raptors {{began as an}} expansion team in 1995 and first participated in the NBA draft on June 28, 1995 at the SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In 1989, the NBA agreed with the National Basketball Players' Association to limit drafts to two rounds, an arrangement that has remained the same up the present time.

5000|$|The Toss-up Round {{does not}} involve active teamwork; rather, an {{individual}} on either <b>team</b> <b>can</b> buzz in and collect 10 points {{for his or her}} team for a correct response. If one member of the team answers incorrectly, no other members of that <b>team</b> <b>can</b> buzz in, although a member of the opposing <b>team</b> <b>can</b> still offer an answer. This round lasts 10 minutes, after which the host takes a short break to [...] "get to know" [...] the contestants Jeopardy! style by asking personal questions that were created by the players before recording.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike the 2003 TMNT game, Battle Nexus {{supports}} {{up to four}} players.

5|$|The game {{is based}} on the fictional extreme sport Blitz, a futuristic full-contact hybrid of hockey and {{basketball}} played with a flying disc. Two teams of four players attempt to move the disc through their opponent's goal, and <b>teams</b> <b>can</b> either win on points or by knocking out their opposing team. There are 150 individual characters across 18 thematic teams. The single-player campaign's plot is set in the 23rd century, when Blitz is a popular, televised sport and the teams battle to scale the ranks and win the championship. Players earn credits from their goals scored, opponent knockouts, and crowd-pleasing to be spent on player upgrades, bets, and new teammates. The game also supports split-screen and System Link multiplayer for up to eight players across up to eight Xbox consoles.|$|E
5|$|The team placed {{fifth in}} the Premier League {{automatically}} qualifies for the UEFA Europa League, and the sixth and seventh-placed <b>teams</b> <b>can</b> also qualify, depending on {{the winners of the}} two domestic cup competitions i.e. the FA Cup and the EFL Cup. Two Europa League places are reserved for the winners of each tournament; if the winner of either the FA Cup or EFL Cup qualifies for the Champions League, then that place will go to the next-best placed finisher in the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|Before each draft, an NBA draft lottery {{determines the}} first round {{selection}} order for the teams that {{did not make the}} playoffs during the prior season. <b>Teams</b> <b>can</b> also trade their picks, which means that a team could have more than or less than two picks in one draft. As a result of the various trades, the Minnesota Timberwolves had four draft picks in 1992 and 2006. The Timberwolves drafted Pooh Richardson with their first ever draft pick, tenth overall, in the 1989 NBA draft. In 1995, the Timberwolves picked Kevin Garnett fifth overall, who went on to be a 13-time All-Star. In 1996, the Timberwolves drafted Ray Allen fifth overall but was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks with a future first-round pick for the draft rights of Stephon Marbury. In the 2008 NBA draft, the Timberwolves drafted O. J. Mayo third overall but was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies along with three other players from the Timberwolves for the draft rights to Kevin Love along with three other players from the Grizzlies.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} four drafts the Rockets participated in, each team had a total of 90 draft choices (14 in 1967, and 19 each from 1968 to 1971). For two drafts in 1972 and 1973, there were eight rounds, and from 1974 to 1985, the draft was 10 rounds long. However, in 1985, the draft was {{shortened}} to seven rounds, and in 1989, the NBA agreed with the National Basketball Players' Association to limit drafts to two rounds, an arrangement that has remained the same up the present time.

5|$|In {{the middle}} of the 2012–13 posting season, MLB {{approached}} NPB seeking to change the way MLB teams bid for the right to negotiate with NPB players. Instead of using a silent auction in which teams bid blindly, MLB would prefer its teams to participate in a traditional, open auction where the bids are known and <b>teams</b> <b>can</b> knowingly outbid each other. Such a change would likely lower the price of the transfer fees paid to NPB teams. MLB and the players' unions agree that they'd prefer to see the players receive more money for the transfer rather than the teams. The Japan Times columnist Jason Coskrey also believed that these talks provided the JPBPA an opportunity to voice their concerns about the posting system and attempt to gain more leverage for themselves during the posting process. The new agreement, as noted, was announced on December 16, 2013, with most of the changes desired by MLB and players from both leagues.|$|E
5|$|Subway Series {{is a term}} {{applied to}} any series of {{baseball}} games between New York City teams, as opposing <b>teams</b> <b>can</b> travel to compete merely by using the subway system. Subway Series is a term long used in New York, going back to series between the Brooklyn Dodgers or New York Giants and the New York Yankees in the 1940s and 1950s. Today, the term is {{used to describe the}} rivalry between the Yankees and the New York Mets. During the 2000 World Series, cars on the 4 train (which stopped at Yankee Stadium) were painted with Yankee colors, while cars on the 7 train (which stopped at Shea Stadium) had Mets colors. The term could also be applied to the rivalry between the New York Knicks and the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association, or the New York Rangers and the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League ever since the Nets and the Islanders moved to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.|$|E

5|$|The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Men's Division I Basketball Championship, or NCAA Tournament, is a single-elimination {{tournament for}} men's college {{basketball}} {{teams in the}} United States. It determines the champion of Division I, the top level of play in the NCAA, and the media often describes the winner as the national champion of college basketball. The NCAA Tournament has been held annually since 1939, and its field grew from eight teams in the beginning to sixty-five teams by 2001; as of 2011, sixty-eight teams {{take part in the}} tournament. <b>Teams</b> <b>can</b> gain invitations by winning a conference championship or receiving an at-large bid from a 10-person committee. The semifinals of the tournament are known as the Final Four and are held in a different city each year, along with the championship game; Indianapolis, the city where the NCAA is based, will host the Final Four every five years until 2040. Each winning university receives a rectangular, gold-plated trophy made of wood.|$|E
5|$|The team secured several high {{placings}} in {{the later}} season, but did not obtain any victories. In late July, the team took two of the top six placings at the Polynormande, with El Fares in second and Gallopin in sixth. El Fares {{had been part of}} a breakaway, and Gallopin first from the peloton four and a half minutes back. The result put Gallopin into the lead in the French Road Cycling Cup, the year-long competition among French single-day races where French riders, and those on French <b>teams,</b> <b>can</b> earn points. Cusin came eighth at the Tour du Doubs in September. Petit just missed out on the podium at the Grand Prix de Fourmies, finishing fourth in a large field sprint. He made the podium in a similar finish at Binche–Tournai–Binche in October, finishing third. Also in October, Dumoulin took ninth place at Paris–Bourges, from a selective sprint of ten riders. Duque was seventh in a leading group of thirteen at the Grand Prix de la Somme. Though he won only the one race, Gallopin's consistent high finishes in the French single-day races made him the overall victor of the season-long French Road Cycling Cup, which he clinched after the Tour de Vendée.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of a pit road, the race was split into three {{segments}} of 60, 50 and 40 laps so <b>teams</b> <b>can</b> make pit stops and adjustments between each segment, {{and there would be no}} positions gained nor lost during stops. In segment 1, Timothy Peters took the lead from pole-sitter Ken Schrader on lap 15, and led for 23 laps until Kyle Larson took the lead on lap 39, who led for the remainder of the segment. In the final five laps of the segment, the first caution of the race flew for debris, and the beneficiary was Max Gresham, who was the first driver at least a lap down, which allowed him to regain a lap. In the second segment, Larson continued to lead for a total of 50 laps until Austin Dillon passed him on lap 89 after the former collided with Germán Quiroga. One lap later, another caution was flown for debris, and Gresham was again the beneficiary. On lap 116, Jared Landers' truck became loose in turn 2, collected Ty Dillon and made contact with Johnny Sauter. Quiroga was the beneficiary on the resulting caution. Larson and Austin Dillon dueled for the remainder of the race, with Dillon allowing Larson to pass on lap 122, but Dillon managed to get past Larson on the following lap. Two more cautions for debris (first on the front stretch, the second in turn 4) were eventually flown, and a green–white–checker finish was initiated due to debris in turn 4 on lap 149. Dillon retained the lead on the GWC to win, beating Larson by 1.197 seconds. Behind Dillon and Larson, Ryan Newman finished third, followed by Joey Coulter, Brendan Gaughan, Timothy Peters, Darrell Wallace Jr., Matt Crafton, Dave Blaney and Max Gresham. Sauter (accident) and Jeff Babcock (engine) failed to finish the race.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{animation}} industry traditionally drew every film cel by hand. This is labor-intensive and inefficient; the cels {{are generally}} non-reusable, and errors {{are difficult to}} correct. This method is called the 2D approach due to the conception of the source images in only two dimensions. The use of computers and graphics software introduced computer graphics (CG) into the industry. This reduced waste; animators can reuse digital cels to correct errors and make changes. Increasing computer power spread the use of three-dimensional graphics software to create 3D models and environments, and render them as 2D images. This 3D approach requires more resources to create the 3D models, but production <b>teams</b> <b>can</b> correct errors or remake film sequences much faster than the traditional 2D approach. The 2D-3D hybrid approach in Karas was due to budget and aesthetic concerns. The 2D approach allowed greater artistic details and creativity, and the 3D approach could save resources. Sato, however, disapproved the common notion of using the 3D approach for economic concern. He pushed the team to enhance image quality with detailed CG. He was also dissatisfied with computer lighting effects, and ordered the animators to draw them by hand. Due to the bright colors of the original cels, they darkened the images and concentrated on areas where shadows should be, leaving untouched the areas where light falls on.|$|E
