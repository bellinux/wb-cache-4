5|$|On January 14, 2006, Judge Christopher Droney {{stated that}} unless WWE {{gave him a}} good {{argument}} between then and the 25th, he would rule in favor of Lesnar, giving him a summary judgment. This would have enabled Lesnar to work anywhere immediately. WWE was later granted a deadline postponement. On April 24, WWE announced on WWE.com <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> had reached a settlement. On June 12, a federal judge dismissed the case {{at the request of}} both legal parties.|$|E
5|$|The tribe then {{appealed the}} case to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appellate court found that various federal laws {{required}} the DOI and BIA to maintain historic buildings and to maintain Indian trust properties, but that they did not authorize monetary damages. The court then looked to the 1960 act and determined that this act did create a trust relationship that could be enforced with monetary damages. This was based on common law, with the court referencing the Restatement (Second) of Trusts to outline that a trust requires a trustee (the United States), a beneficiary (the tribe), and a trust body (the land and buildings). The court noted <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> agreed that there was a trust, but not that damages were authorized. The court held that where the United States had control over the use and maintenance of the buildings to the exclusion of the tribe, a fiduciary duty was created that authorized the tribe to seek monetary damages. The court then reversed and remanded the decision of the trial court. The United States appealed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.|$|E
25|$|The joint communique said <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> {{have promised}} {{to fix the problem}} within a month with a three-man panel made up of then-BAP head Lina and Pilipinas Basketball President Bernie Atienza and a neutral person to oversee the formation.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, Xerox and the {{hospital}} that examined Uyesugi settled a civil lawsuit brought by {{the families of the}} shooting victims.

25|$|Preference for unequal {{distribution}} {{has been}} developed to the human race possibly because it allows for better co-operation and allows a person {{to work with a}} more productive person so <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> benefit from the co-operation. Inequality also solves the problems of free-riders, cheaters and ill-behaving people.|$|E
25|$|King aide Andrew Young later {{claimed in}} a 2013 {{interview}} with the Academy of Achievement that {{the main source of}} tension between the SCLC and FBI was the government agency's lack of black agents, and <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> were willing to cooperate with each other by the time the Selma to Montgomery marches had taken place.|$|E
50|$|The {{contract}} {{should not}} contain arbitrary limitations on timing of payments. Provisions <b>that</b> assure <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> {{of time to}} properly present and consider claims are acceptable provided they are commercially reasonable and customary.|$|R
50|$|The {{doctrine}} of concurrent delay is a contract law theory used to eliminate delay damages, under the premise <b>that</b> where <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> to the contract caused delays {{to the overall}} project, neither party can recover damages for {{that period of time}} when <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> were at fault.|$|R

25|$|In the {{following}} months, the BZÖ tried to establish itself within the Austrian political landscape, but met little success. Haider {{and his new}} party remained in the coalition with the People's party, leading to fierce fights between the FPÖ and BZÖ following the split-up. Subsequent polls showed <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> were losing voter approval and in danger of failing to reach the critical 4% of the national vote barrier required for representation in parliament.|$|E
25|$|The anti-psychiatry {{movement}} {{coming to}} the fore in the 1960s has opposed many of the practices, conditions, or existence of mental hospitals. The psychiatric consumer/survivor movement has often objected to or campaigned against conditions in mental hospitals or their use, voluntarily or involuntarily. The mental patient liberation movement emphatically opposes involuntary treatment but generally {{does not have any}} issue with any psychiatric treatments that are consensual, provided <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> are free to withdraw consent at any time.|$|E
25|$|Instead of {{responding}} to his complaint, Hayden Stone sought a stay pending the outcome of arbitration, per a clause in Wilko's customer agreement mandating <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> use that method of dispute resolution. They cited another statute, the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which required that courts grant stays for arbitration {{as long as the}} dispute was covered by the parties' contractual agreement and the contract was valid. In response, Wilko cited language in the 1933 Act barring any such contractual waiver of an investor's right to take such claims to court.|$|E
50|$|Interest rate swaps {{are also}} popular for the {{arbitrage}} opportunities they provide. Varying levels of creditworthiness {{means that there is}} often a positive quality spread differential <b>that</b> allows <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> to benefit from an interest rate swap.|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on post-communist party politics frequently suggests that membership organizations are not important for {{political parties in}} the region, as elections can be won with expensive media-based campaigns. The article tests this argument using the parliamentary elections in Lithuania in the 2000 s held under a mixed electoral system. The results suggest <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>party</b> membership organization and campaign spending have roughly equal effects on the electoral persistence of political parties. New parties also benefit from both strong membership organizations and high campaign spendi...|$|R
50|$|Many states {{recognize}} {{through their}} judicial systems cohabitation agreements and common law partner agreements concluded between two {{partners in a}} relationship.These are de facto domestic partnerships <b>that</b> protect <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> and allow for shared property and court recognition of their relationships.|$|R
25|$|Remedies {{are partly}} {{regulated}} by the Misrepresentation Act 1967. English law generally allows a contract to be unwound, so <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> are put back into the position before the agreement was made. It {{may be that the}} misrepresentation was incorporated into the contract as a term, so as an alternative one can claim the contract should subsist and claim for a loss in expectations. In this case the misrepresentee can equally sue for damages as if the misrepresentation had been true. A misrepresentee may also sue for any losses due to relying on the misrepresentation.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 serious {{efforts to}} explore the ABM problem started. By this point the US and USSR had agreed in the ABM Treaty to deploy up to 100 ABMs at only two sites. MIRVs had so seriously upset the balance between ABM and ICBM <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> agreed to limit ABM {{deployment}} largely {{as a way of}} avoiding a massive buildup of new ICBMs. The only good news for the UK in this development was that it clearly defined the problem they were facing; their attacks {{had to be able to}} credibly defeat a 100-interceptor ABM defense around Moscow. Thus started project KH.793, a one-year project to identify potential solutions.|$|E
25|$|Arc Symphony was {{developed}} by Sophia Park and Penelope Evans using the game engine Twine. Both of them had prior experience with fan communities: Evans mentioned having {{been a member of}} message boards for the game The Sims 2 as a child and having nostalgic feelings for it, while Park said that although she did not miss old websites, bulletin board systems and mailing lists, they still were a part of her. Evans described the game's interactions as feeling like a real forum experience, saying that while people look at pixels at their screen, a real person is on the other side, and <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> get to accept or reject the other, with the possibility of hurting them.|$|E

50|$|The double-swing model (also {{known as}} the Möbius {{integration}} philosophy) is model of intercultural communication, originated by Muneo Yoshikawa, conceptualizing how individuals, cultures, and intercultural notions can meet in constructive ways.

25|$|On May 19, Roberto Madrazo, presidential {{candidate}} for the PRI, considered by all polls {{to be in a}} distant third place, hinted at the possibility of an alliance with López Obrador to prevent Calderón from winning the election, after both the parties had criticized the government for what, in their opinion, is supposed illegal support by the federal government for the National Action Party (PAN) candidate's campaigning. The PRD has said <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> have entered into an information sharing agreement regarding the issue. This, combined with calls from high ranking PRI member Manuel Bartlett (former interior secretary when the alleged 1988 presidential election fraud was committed) to vote for López, aroused media speculation that the PRI and the PRD would indeed ally.|$|E
25|$|On {{the eve of}} the election, Merkel {{was still}} favored to win a decisive victory based on opinion polls. On 18 September 2005, Merkel's CDU/CSU and Schröder's SPD went {{head-to-head}} in the national elections, with the CDU/CSU winning 35.2% (CDU 27.8%/CSU 7.5%) of the second votes to the SPD's 34.2%. The result was so close, both Schröder and Merkel claimed victory. Neither the SPD-Green coalition nor the CDU/CSU and its preferred coalition partners, the Free Democratic Party, held enough seats to form a majority in the Bundestag. A grand coalition between the CDU/CSU and SPD faced the challenge <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> demanded the chancellorship. However, after three weeks of negotiations, the two parties reached a deal whereby Merkel would become Chancellor and the SPD would hold 8 of the 16 seats in the cabinet.|$|E
25|$|Later the Pretoria Minute {{represented}} {{another step}} towards resolution where agreements at Groote Schuur were reconsolidated and steps towards {{setting up an}} interim government and drafting a new constitution were established as well as suspension of the military wing of the ANC – the Umkhonto we Sizwe. This step helped end much of the violence within South Africa. Another agreement {{that came out of}} the Pretoria Minute was <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> would try and raise awareness that a new way of governance was being created for South Africa, and that further violence would only hinder this process. However, violence still continued in Kwazulu-Natal, which violated the trust between Mandela and de Klerk. Moreover, internal disputes in the ANC prolonged the war as consensus on peace was not reached.|$|E
40|$|Alongside parties such as UKIP in the UK and the Front National in France, Italy’s Lega Nord {{have also}} taken a notably Eurosceptic stance {{prior to this}} month’s European Parliament elections. Duncan McDonnell writes that while the party has joined the Eurosceptic {{alliance}} led by the Front National and Geert Wilder’s Party for Freedom, Lega Nord’s policies on Europe do not form a particularly strong {{part of its appeal}} to the electorate. He notes that the party was not only strongly pro-Europe in the past, but <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>party</b> representatives and members have tended to view Europe as a minor concern in comparison to issues such as Italian federalism and immigration...|$|R

25|$|After reports had {{surfaced}} <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> {{had agreed}} to all terms, Golden Boy Promotions released a press release on December 22, 2009, revealing that Pacquiao was unwilling {{to comply with the}} Olympic-style drug testing requested by Team Mayweather. The following day, Bob Arum, Top Rank founder and CEO, declared the fight was off and Pacquiao would be facing a different opponent: We appeased Mayweather by agreeing to a urine analysis at any time, and blood testing before the press conference and after the fight. Mayweather pressed for blood testing even up to the weigh-in. He knew that Manny gets freaked out when his blood gets taken and feels that it weakens him. This is just harassment and, to me, just signaled that he didn't want the fight. Arum told David Mayo of the Grand Rapids Press.|$|E
25|$|In a 2015 study, BDSM {{relationships}} were suggested {{to have a}} higher level of connection, intimacy, trust and communication compared to individuals who do not practice BDSM. The study suggests that dominants and submissives exchange control for each other's pleasure and to satisfy a need. They mention <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> enjoys pleasing their partner in any way they can. Submissive and Dominants who participated in their research, felt {{that this is one of}} the best things about BDSM. It gives a submissive pleasure to do things in general for their dominant. Where Dominant enjoys making their encounters all about the submissive. They enjoy doing things that makes their submissive happy. Their findings suggest that submissives and dominants found BDSM play more pleasurable and fun. BDSM was also suggested to improve personal growth, romantic relationships, their sense of community, their sense of self, the dominants confidence, and help an individual cope with everyday things by giving them a psychological release.|$|E
25|$|Incumbent {{president}} Miloš Zeman {{is running}} for reelection. He {{is expected to be}} supported by Freedom and Direct Democracy and Dawn - National Coalition. Independent candidate Michal Horáček was considered his main rival in early 2017. The Social Democratic Party said it will hold a presidential primary in November 2017 to choose their candidate but finally they did not organize them. ANO 2011 also planed to hold a presidential primary but decided to not. It was speculated <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> may select Zeman as their candidate, but ČSSD leader Bohuslav Sobotka announced that his party probably would not support Zeman due to his actions during the Czech government crisis in May 2017. It was reported that ČSSD planned to nominate Lubomír Zaorálek who decided to not run. Drahoš is running with the support of TOP 09, and the Christian and Democratic Union (KDU-ČSL) and Mayors and Independents are also expected to support his candidacy.|$|E
