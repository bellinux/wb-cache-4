The Chaplain is available to provide spiritually supportive counseling, life review and may connect a patient with clergy they are comfortable with.

The game also uses MotionScan to capture actor's facial expressions. BBC News reporter Kev Geoghegan estimated that the development budget for the game exceeded US$50 million, making L.A.

5|$|The {{development}} of L.A. Noire began in 2004 following {{the founding of}} its developer Team Bondi. Rockstar Games published L.A. Noire on 17 May 2011 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and on 8 November 2011 for Microsoft Windows; a re-release for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is scheduled for 14 November 2017. Though Team Bondi oversaw development, the work was shared between <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>team</b> and multiple Rockstar studios around the world. L.A. Noire was delayed numerous times through its seven-year development, which included a change of publisher and platforms.

Noire was formally announced in 2005; it was heavily promoted through video trailers and press demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|Development of post-release content faced {{numerous}} setbacks. In May 2012, publisher Autumn Games was sued over {{allegations of}} fraud regarding an unrelated property, Def Jam Rapstar, cutting off Skullgirls financial support and forcing developer Reverge Labs {{to lay off}} the entire development team. <b>The</b> <b>core</b> <b>team</b> would eventually reform as Lab Zero Games in November 2012, launching a successful crowdfunding campaign to raise funds to continue their work. After Autumn Games severed ties with distributor Konami Digital Entertainment in December 2013, the latter formally requested to have the game removed from the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade. The game was later re-released on both platforms in 2014 as Skullgirls Encore. When the game was ported to the PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and Xbox One in 2015, it was renamed once again to Skullgirls 2nd Encore.|$|E
5|$|The hospice {{interdisciplinary}} team is {{the core}} service which every hospice provides to patients and families. Hospice differs from other forms of care in that the core members of the hospice team function as an interdisciplinary, rather than a multidisciplinary, team. Multidisciplinary teams involve several professionals who independently treat various issues a patient may have. The problems that are being treated {{may or may not}} relate to other issues being addressed by individual team members. Interdisciplinary team approach involves all members of the team working together towards the same goal, which in this case is to afford patients a comfortable dying experience and families the support they need in coping with this. In an interdisciplinary team approach, there can often be role blending by members of <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>team,</b> who may take on tasks usually filled by other team members.|$|E

5|$|No new {{gameplay}} {{content was}} added to Type-0 HD. The team instead focused on upgrading the graphics, adjusting existing gameplay for home consoles, and including a lower difficulty level. The latter was due to complaints from players that the original game was too difficult. While carrying over the original's multiplayer functions was considered, it would have lengthened the estimated development time by another year. Since Tabata's priority was to bring the game to fans worldwide, the multiplayer and associated elements were either removed or incorporated into the single-player campaign. Tabata also decided against creation of a demo or an international version for this reason. As {{a substitute for the}} multiplayer, the team strengthened and improved the original single-player Academy Assistance function. As with the original, the team used the names of developers from both <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>team</b> and other Square Enix departments for the NPCs. While the main story remained unchanged, a secret cutscene teasing future Type games was commissioned. Created by Square Enix's CGI movie subsidiary Visual Works, it was based on some of Tabata's early ideas for Type-0. A small piece of the cutscene was shown privately to attendees of Square Enix's 25th anniversary commemoration event for the Final Fantasy series. Hiroki Chiba, writer for Type-0, returned to write the scene. In the cutscene, a fatally-wounded samurai warrior resembling main protagonist Ace is saved from death by a fire spirit.|$|E
5|$|The Angel of Darkness started {{development}} {{three years}} prior to its release under the working title Tomb Raider next generation. As part of the preparation for the game, the company conducted market research, and decided {{to create a new}} setting and story for the main character. One of the main drives behind the game was fully utilising the new platform's potential and reinventing the character of Lara Croft, including rebuilding her character model and allowing her to perform melee combat. It was the first game in the series to be made for the PlayStation 2 platform: the previous entry in the series, , had pushed the PlayStation to its technical limits, contributing to lower review scores and sales than previous titles in the series. Core Design separated into two teams, with a new team working on Angel of Darkness and series regulars on Tomb Raider: Chronicles. After the completion of Tomb Raider: Chronicles, lead programmer Richard Morton came over and found that the new team had gone off the rails, scrapping the entire project once already and completing only the game's basic story. The developers later admitted to being overambitious. Some of them also commented that none of <b>the</b> <b>Core</b> <b>team</b> were prepared for the added complexity of developing for the advanced PlayStation 2. Jonell Elliott returned as the voice of Lara Croft. This would be the last time she provided the voice, with Keeley Hawes taking over for Tomb Raider: Legend.|$|E

500|$|The lead {{designer}} for the game's AI was Yoichiro Miyake, {{who was one}} of <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>team</b> members for the game's engine. Miyake, whose reputation designing quality AI had landed him the position, had an initial concept of creating an AI that would learn and memorize new actions, creating a smooth flow through the various steps it needed to take to make a smoother and more advanced experience. At the start of its development, the developers used the two standard [...] "classic" [...] designs for AIs for reference: behavior-based, which revolved around adaptation and decision making, and state-based, which made decisions based on the environment. For XV, it was decided to create an advanced hybrid of these basic behavioral AI functions. Due to the way Luminous Studio's staff was structured, the team first needed to develop an easy-to-understand tool for managing and developing the AI. This tool was dubbed the [...] "Luminous AI Graph", which represented the multi-layered construction of an AI. The amount of effort put into the AI was directly inspired by experiences of developing games for the previous console generation: the emphasis had been put on graphics, causing the AI and other gameplay-related elements to suffer. Between the release of its commercial demo and the full release, the AI underwent further refinement.|$|E
500|$|Preliminary work on Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis {{began in}} 2005, {{prior to the}} {{announcement}} of the Xbox 360, which the game was developed for. Rockstar San Diego, <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>team</b> behind the game, found that the hardware allowed them to develop games at a faster pace than with the previous hardware. Rockstar president Sam Houser felt that Rockstar San Diego was a suitable developer for the game due to their demonstration of skill in developing advanced engines, particularly early in a console generation, citing [...] and Smuggler's Run (both 2000), which were launch games for the PlayStation 2. Houser also said that, though the game's physics were achievable on the old hardware, the team waited for the possibility to develop for the Xbox 360 due to the [...] "different level of production and technology" [...] that it allowed. In developing the game's concept, the team was fascinated with concentrating the entire power of a particular hardware into one activity. The game runs off the proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE), and is the first game to do so; the engine was later used for other projects such as Grand Theft Auto IV (2008), Red Dead Redemption (2010), Max Payne 3 (2012) and Grand Theft Auto V (2013).|$|E
