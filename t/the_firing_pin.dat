5|$|When {{the trigger}} was pulled, the spring pushed <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> {{forwards}} into the bomb, which ignited the propellant in the bomb and launched {{it out of}} the trough and into the air. The recoil caused by the detonation of the propellant then blew <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> backwards onto the spring; this automatically cocked the weapon for subsequent shots, eliminating the need to manually re-cock.|$|E
5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of firing pin microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> and is transferred to the cartridge during the firing process. Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found at a crime scene to a known firearm. The practice is not in use , although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E
5|$|By {{examining}} unique striations, or markings, {{left behind}} on the bullet as it passes through the barrel and on the cartridge as it is hit by <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin,</b> individual spent rounds can be linked back to a specific weapon. Known exemplars taken from a seized weapon can be directly compared to samples recovered from the scene using a comparison microscope. Striation images can also be uploaded to any existing national databases. Furthermore, these markings {{can be compared to}} other images in an attempt to link one weapon to multiple crime scenes. Like all forensic specialties, forensic firearm examiners are subject to being called to testify in court as expert witnesses.|$|E

5|$|Spent {{cartridges}} {{found at}} a scene can be examined for physical evidence such as fingerprints or compared to samples that match them to a weapon. The examination of the cartridge relies on the unique tool marks left by the {{various parts of the}} weapon including <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> and the ejector in semi and fully automatic firearms. These markings can be compared and matched to known exemplars fired from the same weapon using the same parts. The examination of the marks left on the cartridge is done using a comparison microscope. Examiners view the questioned cartridge and the known exemplar simultaneously, looking for similar microscopic marks left during the firing process.|$|E
5|$|Sayid {{escapes from}} Rousseau's bunker {{while she is}} gone, {{grabbing}} a rifle, maps and notes she has made about the island. Rousseau finds him {{and they have a}} standoff; he tries to fire the rifle, but no bullet discharges. Rousseau says she removed <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin,</b> and Robert, her former lover, made the same mistake before she killed him. She reveals that it was she who killed her team, aiming to stop the disease from reaching the outside world. Sayid talks Rousseau into letting him go, but, before leaving, asks about Alex. Rousseau says that Alex was her child. While trying to find his way back to camp, Sayid hears the whispering of which Rousseau had spoken.|$|E
5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the trigger mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> to the butt; the user would then have to bend over and pull {{the body of the}} weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of the}} weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E
5000|$|The Arsenal Firearms AF2011-A1 is {{a double}} barreled, {{semi-automatic}} pistol of Italian origin. The weapon is a derivative of the M1911 pistol {{and the majority of}} internal parts including <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pins,</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> plates, sear groups, springs, recoil rods and mainspring housings are interchangeable with standard M1911 replacement parts. The purpose of the AF2011A1 pistol is to increase the ballistic capability of the [...]45 ACP round at a lower cost. The AF2011A1 {{has its roots in the}} Grieco pistol that also came with double barrels for the same purpose.|$|R
50|$|The fuse {{is set for}} a {{predetermined}} time by rotation of a time ring in {{the lower part of}} <b>the</b> fuze. On <b>firing,</b> set-back causes <b>the</b> time-train <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> to function. This initiates the powder in the time-train ring and ignites the safety powder pellet, freeing <b>the</b> impact <b>firing</b> <b>pin.</b> Thus <b>the</b> fuze will function on impact if impact occurs before expiration of the set time. The time-setting can be eliminated altogether by turning the setting ring off the scale. It {{should be noted that the}} fuze is not interchangeable with fuzes used in other 8 cm mortar ammunition.|$|R
50|$|The Fokker-Leimberger used {{percussion}} ignition with <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> {{mounted on}} a swashplate. No extractor was employed; the spent cases were simply left on the outgoing belt. The gun {{would have had to}} be pre-rotated in flight {{in order to ensure that}} when the trigger was pulled it would have fired at its maximum speed at once. Similarly to the Gatling designs, the use of multiple barrels enabled air cooling of each barrel in the time between successive shots were <b>fired</b> from <b>the</b> same barrel.|$|R
25|$|The pistol {{is fired}} {{by a single}} action hammer, and has a manual safety switch on the slide. The ambidextrous safety switch rotates a drum {{mechanism}} which sits over <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin,</b> causing <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> to lock in, which prevents it from moving forward and reduces {{the possibility of the}} gun discharging accidentally. With the safety off, pulling the trigger releases the hammer to fall downward, hitting <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> and causing the chambered round to discharge.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{models have}} an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker {{located on the}} slide; when the safety lever is lowered to the safe position, <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> is cammed into the slide away from the hammer, the trigger is disconnected from the sear, and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered, it only cams <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> into the slide and drops the hammer. When the lever is released, <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> springs back to the normal position. The DAO models have no manual safety or decocker. All models feature an automatic firing pin safety that blocks <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.|$|E
25|$|Early torpedoes used contact {{exploder}}s. A typical exploder had {{a firing}} pin that stuck {{out from the}} warhead and was restrained by a transverse shear pin. The torpedo would hit the target with enough energy to break the shear pin and allow <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> to strike a percussion cap that ultimately detonated the warhead. An arming impeller was an additional safety device: <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> could not move until the torpedo had travelled a preset distance.|$|E
50|$|Seventeen {{parts of}} the M1911 were reduced in size {{for the design of}} the EMP. The slide and frame were both shortened, necessitating changes to <b>the</b> extractor, <b>firing</b> <b>pin,</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> spring, and trigger bow, as well as the plunger tube. The grip frame {{circumference}} has also been reduced due to the magazine itself being made shorter, front-to-back.|$|R
50|$|Every firearm leaves unique, {{reproducible}} {{markings on}} expended bullet and cartridge cases that it <b>fired.</b> <b>The</b> barrel, <b>firing</b> <b>pin,</b> <b>firing</b> chamber, extractor, ejector {{and other parts}} of the gun leave these marks, called toolmarks, on the bullet and cartridge case faces. Individually and collectively, these markings function as the “ballistic signature” of the firearm.|$|R
50|$|A hammerless {{weapon is}} a {{modification}} of <b>the</b> original <b>firing</b> mechanism of firearms. Hammerless firearms do not feature an exposed firing hammer or firing “spur”. This feature is easily identifiable {{in the rear of}} the weapon's stock and requires the operator to manually “cock” it to arm the weapon. Rifles with an exposed firing hammer were frequently subjected to accidental discharges due to <b>the</b> exposed <b>firing</b> <b>pin.</b> With a hammerless weapon an internal <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> reduced <b>the</b> risk of accidental discharge to the operator, because of the safety features of <b>the</b> internal <b>firing</b> <b>pin.</b> <b>The</b> rifle subsequently became capable of having a more rapid Firing Rate as well, because the operator no longer had to manually “cock” the weapon prior to each time the weapon was discharged. <b>The</b> exposed <b>firing</b> hammer was also frequently caught on clothing and interfered with the operator’s ability to aim accurately. The introduction of hammerless technology in rifles and later on in modern times, pistols greatly improved <b>the</b> safety, <b>firing</b> rate, and accuracy of firearms.|$|R
25|$|Early P85 pistols were {{recalled}} for {{a safety}} issue {{that resulted in}} one accidental discharge. If <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> broke in front of <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> block, applying the safety, which dropped the hammer, could transfer enough energy to the broken firing pin to cause a discharge. The P85 was recalled, and a new safety was installed that prevented contact between firing pin and hammer during a decocking operation. This modification was done free of charge. The P85 MKII was released with the safety fix, larger safety levers, improved accuracy, and the option of a stainless-steel slide.|$|E
25|$|The contact pistol {{frequently}} {{failed to}} fire the warhead. It often jammed with a textbook right angle hit to a ship's side as <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> could not take {{the shock of the}} impact.|$|E
25|$|Load each chamber in {{sequence}} (original), setting the hammer {{in the safety}} notch when finished; or (safe and prudent method) load one chamber, skip the next, load the remaining four chambers, close the loading gate, draw the hammer to full cock and lower fully, making sure that <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> is over the empty chamber.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> {{of three}} {{different}} handguns were modified to stamp a six-digit alpha-numeric code and a circumferential digital code known as a gear code into the primer of a cartridge when fired. In this paper the transfer of gear codes from <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> to primers was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Only those cartridges that received poor clarity marks optically as regarding the alpha-numeric code were chosen for evaluation in the SEM. Photo editing software was employed to clearly outline and decipher the gear code around the circumference of the microstamped primer. Results show that the better imaging of the SEM allows more of the alpha-numeric identifiers to be distinguished {{as well as more}} of the gear code structure, however complete recognition is still not possible in all cases...|$|R
40|$|The {{transfer}} of microstamped identifiers to <b>the</b> primers of <b>fired</b> cartridges was examined using a stereomicroscope and {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM). The identifiers were placed on <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> of three different 9 mm handguns, namely, a Sig Sauer, a Taurus, and a Hi-Point. Ten different brands of ammunition were fired from each handgun, 100 rounds being fired using each brand {{for a total of}} 1000 rounds <b>fired</b> per handgun. <b>The</b> quality of the markings was evaluated using a simple observation rubric. These results were compared to Vickers hardness values obtained from the ammunition primers and are discussed in light of the types of actions of firearms used...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} factory <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> for <b>the</b> CZ 52 {{were made}} of weak cast metal and due to their design are known to break during dry firing [...] which should be avoided.

25|$|The {{action of}} the Krag–Petersson is, {{as seen in the}} {{photograph}} to the left, simple compared to modern rifles. It consists of eight components: the receiver (A), the hammer (B), the tilting breechblock (C), <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> (D), two pins to secure the hammer and breechblock (E and F), a lockplate with a screw to secure the pins (G) and the tubular magazine (not shown in the photograph).|$|E
25|$|The Mark 6's contact {{exploder}} mechanism {{descended from}} the Mark 3 contact exploder. Both exploders had the unusual feature that the firing pin's travel was perpendicular to the torpedo's travel, so <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> {{would be subject to}} side loading when the torpedo struck its target. The Mark 3 exploder was designed when torpedo speeds were much slower (the Mark 10 torpedo's speed was 30 knots), but even then the Mark 3 prototypes had problems with <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> binding during the high deceleration when the torpedo collided with the target. The solution was to use a stronger firing spring to overcome the binding. The Mark 14 torpedo had a much higher speed (46 knots), so it would see significantly higher deceleration, but BuOrd apparently just assumed the contact exploder would work at the higher speed. There were no live-fire tests of the Mark 14 torpedo, so there were no-live fire tests of its contact exploder. If BuOrd had tried some live-fire tests of the contact exploder during peacetime, it probably would have experienced some duds and rediscovered the binding problem.|$|E
25|$|Polymer {{holsters}} {{in various}} configurations and matching magazine pouches are available. In addition, Glock produces optional triggers, recoil springs, slide stops, magazine release levers, and maritime spring cups. Maritime spring cups {{are designed to}} allow the pistol to be fired immediately after being submerged in water. They feature additional openings that allow liquids to flow and escape around them, offering enhanced reliability when water has penetrated into <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> assembly channel.|$|E
50|$|The pencil {{detonator}} {{consisted of}} a thin copper tube containing copper chloride that would take about ten minutes to silently eat through wire holding back <b>the</b> spring-loaded <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> from <b>the</b> percussion cap. This mechanism provided a time delay for detonation, without any telltale ticking of a clockwork mechanism or smell from a burning fuse.|$|R
50|$|As a rule, most purpose-made {{military}} booby-trap firing devices {{contain some}} form of spring-loaded <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> designed to strike a percussion cap connected to a detonator at one end. The detonator is inserted into an explosive charge e.g. C4 or a block of TNT. Triggering the booby-trap (e.g. by pulling on a trip-wire) releases <b>the</b> cocked <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> which flips forward to strike <b>the</b> percussion cap, <b>firing</b> both it and the attached detonator. The resulting shock-wave from the detonator sets off the main explosive charge.|$|R
50|$|After Doc is buried, Pat {{offers to}} give Billy their friend's revolvers. He also persuades Billy {{to give him}} his guns, saying that he can then claim that it is Billy in the grave. The Kid can leave his past behind him and have a fresh start in life. However, it is all a trick. Pat had removed <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> from Doc's revolvers. Fortunately for Billy, while {{comparing}} the guns, he had inadvertently switched one of Doc's for his. As a result, neither his gun nor Pat's fires. Billy pulls out a second, working gun. He handcuffs Pat, judging that the lawman will still state that Billy is dead rather than admit the Kid left him helpless. As he is riding away, Billy stops and looks back; an overjoyed Rio gets on his horse.|$|R
25|$|The Type 100 had a {{chrome-plated}} bore to {{help fight}} corrosion in Asian jungle conditions. Its complex ammunition feed included a feature whereby <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> would not operate until the round was fully chambered; frequent stoppages in firing were experienced in the field. The round was the underpowered and relatively ineffective 8x22mm Nambu pistol round. The curved box magazine extending {{from the left side}} made for poor weapon balance when full. The sights were canted to the left.|$|E
25|$|Between 1982–1983 the P7 {{received}} several modifications, mainly to address American market demand and shooter preferences. These modifications {{resulted in the}} P7M8 model. A new magazine release lever (available {{on both sides of}} the frame) was installed just beneath the trigger guard, which forced designers to modify both the pistol's frame and magazine. The trigger guard was equipped with a synthetic heat shield that protects the shooter from excessive heating and a lanyard attachment loop was added in place of the previous magazine heel release. <b>The</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> and its bushing were also changed.|$|E
25|$|The P345, {{released}} in 2004, incorporates an integrated keyed lock that locks the {{safety in the}} safe position, a loaded chamber indicator, and a magazine disconnect that blocks <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> when the magazine is removed. It also has many ergonomic improvements, such as a new polymer frame design (narrower than the double column derived P90 and P97) and low-profile safety levers. It does not feature an ambidextrous slide release or magazine release. Both controls are designed for a right-handed shooter. The model P345PR adds a Picatinny rail to the frame, for mounting lights and other accessories. It {{was designed to be}} legal for sale in states that require elaborate safety measures.|$|E
50|$|Maraging steel's {{strength}} and malleability in the pre-aged stage {{allows it to}} be formed into thinner rocket and missile skins than other steels, reducing weight for a given strength. Maraging steels have very stable properties, and, even after overaging due to excessive temperature, only soften slightly. These alloys retain their properties at mildly elevated operating temperatures and have maximum service temperatures of over 400 °C F. They are suitable for engine components, such as crankshafts and gears, and <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> of automatic weapons that cycle from hot to cool repeatedly while under substantial load. Their uniform expansion and easy machinability before aging make maraging steel useful in high-wear components of assembly lines and dies. Other ultra-high-strength steels, such as AerMet alloys, are not as machinable because of their carbide content.|$|R
50|$|In {{the army}} industry, Belleville springs are used, for instance, {{in a number}} of landmines e.g. the American M19, M15, M14, M1 and the Swedish Tret-Mi.59. The target (a person or vehicle) exerts {{pressure}} on the belleville spring, causing it to exceed a trigger threshold and flip <b>the</b> adjacent <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> downwards into a stab detonator, firing both it and the surrounding booster charge and main explosive filling.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} a fifteen-month investigation, the NTSB {{determined}} that <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> that downed Flight 592 began in a cargo compartment below the passenger cabin. The cargo compartment was a Class D design, in which fire suppression is accomplished by sealing off the hold from outside air. Any fire in such an airtight compartment would quickly exhaust all available oxygen and then burn itself out. As <b>the</b> <b>fire</b> suppression is accomplished without any intervention by the crew, such holds are not equipped with smoke detectors. However, the NTSB {{determined that}} just before takeoff, over 100 expired chemical oxygen generators were placed in the cargo compartment in five boxes marked COMAT (company material) by ValuJet's maintenance contractor, SabreTech, in contravention of FAA regulations forbidding the transport of hazardous materials in aircraft cargo holds. Failure to cover <b>the</b> generators' <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> with <b>the</b> prescribed plastic caps made an accidental activation much more likely. The investigation revealed that rather than covering <b>the</b> <b>firing</b> <b>pins,</b> <b>the</b> SabreTech workers simply duct-taped the cords around the cans, or cut them, and used tape to stick the ends down. The cylindrical, tennis-ball-can-sized generators also may have been loaded on board in the mistaken belief that they were just empty canisters, thus being certified as safe to transport in an aircraft cargo compartment. SabreTech employees indicated on the cargo manifest that the [...] "oxy canisters" [...] were [...] "empty" [...] instead of being expired oxygen generators. ValuJet employees interpreted this to mean they were empty oxygen canisters, when in fact they were neither simple oxygen canisters, nor empty. A worker then loosely packed the oxygen canisters in several cardboard boxes with a layer of bubble wrap.|$|R
