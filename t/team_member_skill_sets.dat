40|$|Sourcing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} processes of purchasing nowadays and is often strategic, as it affects the entire organization. It requires input from different disciplines within the organization. More and more companies use cross-functional sourcing teams although many initiatives do not provide the expected results. Consequently, it is important to know which factors impact cross-functional sourcing team effectiveness. Cross-functional sourcing teams differ in many important ways from other type of teams. Prior research shows many team characteristics have an influence on team effectiveness. However, these characteristics are hardly investigated for functional sourcing teams in a public context Therefore, the aim of this study was to empirically investigate the relationships between team characteristics directly, mutually or as mediators/moderators and their impact on cross-functional sourcing team effectiveness in a public procurement environment. The study involved an embedded case study among three cross-functional sourcing teams combining document analysis and semi-structured interviews. Analysis entailed within case analyses, followed by a cross-case analysis. The results of the study indicate that factors in the organizational and environmental context are important characteristics with an impact on sourcing team effectiveness. Task and knowledge dependence were found to stimulate communication and contribute to the general sourcing team effectiveness. Interpersonal cohesion appeared to be related to communication in all teams. Teams with greater interpersonal cohesiveness indicated more personal and open communication and greater informal frequency of within-team communication. Apparently, task work communication has a positive impact on task cohesion and interpersonal cohesion has a positive impact on interpersonal communication. Teams should be aware of the negative effects of the temporary absence or permanent leave of a <b>team</b> <b>member</b> with good <b>skills</b> and knowledge. A replacement can lower task cohesion. An important conclusion is that a stable team with no changes in roles and membership during the entire sourcing project is likely to show a strong task cohesion. This study identified the risk of researcher bias and different understandings of the meaning of some concepts. Avenues for future research are making use of an independent researcher for conducting the interviews, an alternative approach to construct measurement, better distinction and further refinement of the concepts, conducting a theory testing research, applying an additional differentiation in objective measures of the concept sourcing team effectiveness, selecting teams with a more recent team assignment, research with more public organizations and sources of data to be able to generalize, making a comparison of public and private organizations, more research on contextual factors, a longitudinal research and, studying also differences in characteristics of a team assignment instead of only team characteristics. Some practical recommendations are to start a sourcing project with an analysis of the environment to create valuable insights; to recognize procedural, organizational, environmental or judicial limitations; to create extra time for team activities and an office space where <b>team</b> <b>members</b> can meet on a regular basis and, identifying key interdependencies. Team managers should be aware that <b>member</b> <b>skills</b> and personal chemistry are important criteria during the selection of new <b>team</b> <b>members,</b> select <b>team</b> <b>members</b> whose <b>skill</b> <b>set</b> is aligned with the goals and the level of representation each needs during each project phase, communicate all sourcing goals from the beginning and repeat regularly to create a common bond and a clear big picture and, take actions to promote greater team communication...|$|R

40|$|Team {{building}} {{is one of}} the key factors of success in business. This study highlights the key elements of building winning teams, where trust is one essential building block and top-level sports teams serve as instructive examples. This study highlights earlier findings that revealed a strong connection between trust and high-performing teams. High-performing teams need talented people but also constant trust-based cooperation. Trust supports cooperative behaviour. Studies of top-level sports teams also emphasize the role of trust when building high-performing teams. This study is implemented using conceptual research in order to organize information related to the complex phenomenon of highperforming teams. The conceptual approach was chosen instead of empirical research due the lack of prior holistic research into high-performing teams including perspectives on trust and sports teams. A theoretical framework is proposed by analysing key characteristics and defining highperforming teams and related concepts. The framework highlights dimensions such as clear vision, trust and communication. <b>Team</b> <b>member</b> <b>skill,</b> motivation and responsibilities were highlighted, and respect and support were also addressed.

40|$|This paper reviews {{contemporary}} {{developments in}} team work design theory and identifies two distinctive team work design concepts currently in use - {{those of the}} autonomous work team and the empowered work team. The paper establishes the critical team work design criteria {{to be applied to}} each concept, with autonomous designs focussing upon the development of team self-organization, the development of <b>team</b> <b>member</b> <b>skills</b> {{and the development of a}} collective voice in setting goals and targets, and empowered designs focussing upon the expansion of the <b>team</b> <b>member</b> work role and the enhancement of team responsibility for business results. The paper goes on to show how these criteria are applied in practice, by presenting comparative case studies of team work in two automotive body stamping plants in the Australian vehicle industry. The research underlines the value of looking at teams from a work design perspective. By developing this perspective, team work design concepts can clearly distinguished and the outcomes of teamworking for employees can be clearly identified. Employees in autonomous teams exercise some control over the allocation of job assignments, have some collective say in the setting of production goals and targets and they have greater opportunities for skill development. Employees in empowered teams, in comparison, exercise less autonomy but have expanded work roles and are far more accountable for business results. Empowered team work designs would seem to offer employees limited gains compared to those available from autonomous designs...|$|R

One of the principal manifestations of this is a move away from team working in a shared work space to team working in a virtual space, using increasingly sophisticated electronic media. Due to the significant operating differences when working in shared and virtual spaces adjustments to generic <b>skills</b> utilised by <b>members</b> is a necessity when moving between the two conditions. This paper reports an aspect of a CRC-CI research project based on research of ‘generic skills’ used by individuals and teams when engaging with high bandwidth information and communication technologies (ICT). It aligns with the project’s other two aspects of collaboration in virtual environments: ‘processes’ and ‘models’. The entire project focuses on the early stages of a project (i. e. design) in which models for the project are being developed and revised. The paper summarises the first stage of the research project which reviews literature to identify factors of virtual teaming which may affect <b>team</b> <b>member</b> <b>skills.</b> It concludes that design team participants require ‘appropriate skills’ to function efficiently and effectively, and that the introduction of high band-width technologies reinforces the need for skills mapping and measurement...|$|R
40|$|With the {{movement}} in education towards collaborative learning, it is becoming more important that learners {{be able to work}} together in groups and teams. Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) have been used successfully to teach individuals, but so far only a few ITSs have been used for the purpose of training teams. This is due to the difficulty of creating such systems. An ITS for teams must be able to assess complex interactions between <b>team</b> <b>members</b> (<b>team</b> <b>skills)</b> as well as the way they interact with the system itself (task skills). Assessing team skills can be difficult because they contain social components such as communication and coordination that are not readily quantifiable. This article addresses these difficulties by developing a framework to guide the authoring process for team tutors. The framework is demonstrated using a case study about a particular team tutor that was developed using a military surveillance scenario for teams of two. The Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT) software provided the team tutoring infrastructure for this task. A new software architecture required to support the team tutor is described. This theoretical framework and the lessons learned from its implementation offer conceptual scaffolding for future authors of ITSs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} the {{work being done}} {{for the design of}} an external video capture card that is capable of inputting a video signal from a DVD player via component video cables and outputting an IEEE 1394 formatted video stream via an IEEE 1394 cable to a personal computer that is connected to a video projector via a VGA cable. An FPGA development board and a video decoder board were purchased to model the video capture system, by using Verilog programming language, the video capture system. The IEEE 1394 connection was not fully implemented at this time due to time, inexperience, and budget constraints. Extensive testing of the analog to digital conversion was done by connecting a DVD player to the video decoder board and outputting the video signal to a computer monitor. The results of testing show that a video signal can be captured, from the DVD player, by the video decoder board and converted using an FPGA to a RGB signal for output to a VGA monitor. We are proposing to upgrade an external video capture card design to include component video inputs and an IEEE 1394 output. These upgrades will allow the user to maintain the quality of the video being captured. It might not be as dramatic as black and white to color television for some but the consumers who have taken note are purchasing HDcapable televisions at a high rate. PC-users- especially Linux-based machine users- are buying or building and installing HDTV tuner cards at a high rate also.

[...] It is based on the attributes among individuals that comprise the team, in addition to their main objective. Team composition is usually either homogeneous, in which all members are the same, or heterogeneous, in which <b>team</b> <b>members</b> all contain significant differences. It has also been identified as a key factor that influences team performance. It factors in the individual attributes of <b>team</b> <b>members</b> (e.g. <b>skill,</b> experience, and ability) and how these contributions can potentially combine to dictate overall performance outcomes for the team. In the past decade, research on team effectiveness has burgeoned as teams have become increasingly common in organizations of all kinds.

The fashion in which a team is configured has a strong influence on team processes and the outcomes that the team achieves. The main outcomes associated with team performance can be classified mostly as performance outcomes (overall quality/precision of work produced, etc.) internal member outcomes (group cohesion, etc.) and behavioral outcomes (absenteeism, etc.).|$|R
