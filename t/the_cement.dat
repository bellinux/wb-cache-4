40|$|In this paper, a {{two-dimensional}} (2 -D) Finite Element (FE) {{analysis of a}} geothermal well was performed with respect to five different cross-sections corresponding to the design specifications for the geothermal well that is currently constructed in Pohang, South Korea. Among the essential components (such as ground formation, casing, and cementing) of a geothermal well, the thermal and mechanical stability of <b>the</b> <b>cementing</b> component was discussed based {{on a series of}} parametric studies with consideration of the thermal conductivity and Young’s modulus of <b>the</b> <b>cementing</b> component. With increasing number of casing layers, <b>the</b> <b>cementing</b> component experiences less stress concentration. In addition, the lower thermal conductivity of <b>the</b> <b>cementing</b> material is advantageous for effectively controlling radial displacement.

40|$|Artificial {{cemented}} sand {{test samples}} were prepared by using ordinary Portland <b>cement</b> (OPC) as <b>the</b> <b>cementing</b> agent. Through uniaxial compression tests and consolidated drained triaxial compression tests, the stress-strain curves of <b>the</b> artificial <b>cemented</b> sand with different cementing agent contents (0. 01, 0. 03, 0. 05 and 0. 08) under various confining pressures (0. 00 MPa, 0. 25 MPa, 0. 50 MPa and 1. 00 MPa) were obtained. Based {{on the test}} results, the effect of <b>the</b> <b>cementing</b> agent content (Cv) on the physical and mechanical properties of <b>the</b> artificial <b>cemented</b> sand were analyzed and the Mohr-Coulomb strength theory was modified by using Cv. The research reveals that when Cv is high (e. g., Cv = 0. 03, 0. 05 or 0. 08), the stress-strain curves of the samples indicate a strain softening behavior; under the same confining pressure, as Cv increases, both the peak strength and residual strength of the samples show a significant increase. When Cv is low (e. g., Cv = 0. 01), the stress-strain curves of the samples indicate strain hardening behavior. From the test data, a function of Cv (<b>the</b> <b>cementing</b> agent content) with c′ (the cohesion force of the sample) and Δϕ′ (the increment of the angle of shearing resistance) is obtained.

5|$|Despite {{representing}} a new vessel, the Enterprise-A {{was the same}} model {{that had been used}} since 1979. Poorly regarded by earlier effects artists because of its complicated wiring and bulk, the Enterprises hairline cracks were puttied and sanded down, and the internal circuitry was redone. The new model's running lights were matched to similar intensities, saving the effects artists time because the lights would look correct with only a single pass, instead of three passes required previously (for the sensor dome, running lights, and window lights). One unfortunate byproduct of the fixes was the loss of the model's distinctive pearlescent finish. The elaborate sheen was never visible on screen (lighting schemes prevented reflections while filming so the ship could be properly inserted into effects shots) and so when the model was repainted with conventional techniques the effect was lost. The Bird of Prey had been damaged from work in The Voyage Home, where the ship was supposed to fly around the sun. To suggest singes, the model had been painted with black-tinged rubber cement, with the expectation that this application would rub off. <b>The</b> <b>cement</b> instead sat on the model and baked itself to the model surface, and had to be scrubbed off.|$|E

40|$|We {{compared}} the radiological appearances and survival of four methods of fixation of a femoral stem in 538 hips after follow-up {{for five or}} ten years. The fixation groups were: 1) press-fit shot-blasted smooth Ti-Al-V stem; 2) press-fit shot-blasted proximally ridged stem; 3) proximal hydroxyapatite (HA) coating; and 4) cementing. Survival analysis at {{five to ten years}} showed better results in the HA-coated (100 % at five to six years) and cemented stems (100 % at 5 to 6 years) than in the two press-fit groups. There was a higher mean rate of migration in the smooth and ridged Ti-Al-V shot-blasted press-fit groups (0. 8 mm/year and 0. 6 mm/year, respectively) when compared with <b>the</b> HA-coated and <b>cemented</b> prostheses (both 0. 3 mm/year). More radiolucent lines and osteolytic lesions were seen in the press-fit groups than in either <b>the</b> HA-coated or <b>cemented</b> implants, with a trend for a lower incidence of both in the HA compared with <b>the</b> <b>cemented</b> group.

5|$|The {{composition}} of the Delos mosaics and pavements include simple pebble constructions, chip-pavement made of white marble, ceramic fragments, and pieces of tesserae. The latter falls into two categories: the simpler, tessellated opus tessellatum using large pieces of tesserae, on average eight millimeters square, and the finer opus vermiculatum using pieces of tesserae smaller than four millimeters square. Many Delian mosaics use a mixture of these materials, while chip pavement is the most common. The latter is found in fifty-five homes and usually reserved for the ground floor. The majority of Delian mosaics comprise broken pieces of marble set into cement floors; other flooring bases are composed of either rammed earth or gneiss flagstones. Pavements in kitchens and latrines were built with pottery, brick, and tile fragments {{for the purpose of}} waterproofing. Thin strips of lead set into <b>the</b> <b>cement</b> are often used to distinguish the contours of geometric-patterned mosaics, but are absent in the more complex tessellated, figured mosaics.|$|E
5|$|Around the 1880s, San Francisco wine dealers were {{purchasing}} {{wine from}} Napa Valley vintners at low prices (sometimes around 15 to 18 cents per gallon). The dealers had facilities to store and age wines that most Napa Valley vintners lacked, and thus {{were able to}} purchase wine from the vintners at low prices. Because of this, Bourn began a campaign to build the cooperative winery; {{he was in his}} early 30s at the time. He created a business partnership with another businessman, E. Everett Wise, who was of a similar age. Bourn then asked for support within the Napa County wine industry. Bourn met with Henry Pellet, president of the St. Helena Vinicultural Club, who endorsed the idea and encouraged his associates to do the same. Bourn and Wise ended up gathering enough support from the local wine industry, and they hired George Percy and Frederick F. Hamilton of the San Francisco architectural firm Percy & Hamilton to design the Greystone Cellars, along with Italian stonemasons to build the façades, and the Ernest L. Ransome firm to handle concrete work. The plans involved the use of new materials and technology of the time, including the relatively new Portland cement. <b>The</b> <b>cement</b> was used as mortar and also poured over the iron reinforcing rods built within the first and second floor elevations. The heavy timber construction of the third floor provided structural support for not only that floor's cask, barrel and bottle aging space but also for the gravity-flow crushing area located on the floor above. The architects planned for the cellars to hold two million gallons of wine at a time, with thirteen tunnels in the hillside behind the building to hold another million gallons. Those tunnels collapsed due to effects of water seepage and of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.|$|E
