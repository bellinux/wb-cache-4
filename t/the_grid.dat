When the cars came around for their second and final timed laps, Ricciardo crossed the line first ahead of the Ferrari drivers, with Vettel going faster than {{teammate}} Räikkönen. When the two Mercedes came across the line last, Hamilton took his fourth consecutive pole position, while Nico Rosberg had to settle for third on <b>the</b> <b>grid,</b> not being able to beat Vettel's time. The two Williams cars filled the third row, while Nico Hülkenberg was delighted with eighth on <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Sundance is {{a puzzle}} arcade game using vector {{graphics}} released by Cinematronics in 1979. The game {{consists of two}} grids floating in a pseudo-3D space with small suns bouncing between them.

5|$|Hamilton {{clinched}} {{his seventh}} pole {{position of the}} season with a time of 1:36.303. He was joined on the front row of <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> by Räikkönen, who qualified 0.342seconds behind Hamilton's time. Massa took third place, needing a good result to retain the possibility of a Championship victory. Alonso qualified in fourth ahead of Kovalainen, who took fifth after struggling for tyre grip during the final session. Webber was sixth fastest in the final session, but was demoted to 16th on <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> {{as a result of his}} penalty. Heidfeld originally qualified sixth, but was penalised three positions for impeding Red Bull driver David Coulthard in the first session. As a result, Toro Rosso driver Sebastian Vettel inherited sixth position, ahead of Trulli and Bourdais. Piquet took tenth position. Kubica's eleventh placing was his worst qualifying result to that point in the season, struggling with his car's set-up throughout his two sessions. Rubens Barrichello of Honda took 13th behind Timo Glock of Toyota, to reach the top 15 for the first time in ten races. Williams driver Nico Rosberg took 14th on <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b> Coulthard failed to move beyond the first session; the Red Bull driver qualified in 15th and blamed Heidfeld for his poor performance. Kazuki Nakajima of Williams, Jenson Button of Honda and the Force Indias of Adrian Sutil and Giancarlo Fisichella would line up on the back two rows of <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{cases of}} self {{consumption}} of the solar energy, the payback time {{is calculated based on}} how much electricity is not purchased from <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b> For example, in Germany, with electricity prices of 0.25 €/kWh and insolation of 900 kWh/kW, one kWp will save €225 per year, and with an installation cost of 1700 €/KWp the system cost will be returned in less than seven years. However, in many cases, the patterns of generation and consumption do not coincide, and {{some or all of the}} energy is fed back into <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b> The electricity is sold, and at other times when energy is taken from <b>the</b> <b>grid,</b> electricity is bought. The relative costs and prices obtained affect the economics. In many markets, the price paid for sold PV electricity is significantly lower than the price of bought electricity, which incentivizes self consumption. Moreover, separate self consumption incentives have been used in e.g. Germany and Italy. Grid interaction regulation has also included limitations of grid feed-in in some regions in Germany with high amounts of installed PV capacity. By increasing self consumption, <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> feed-in can be limited without curtailment, which wastes electricity.|$|E

The other cars started from <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> in the order they were at the point the race was stopped. Michael Schumacher had a poor start and Gerhard Berger took the lead on track (but Schumacher still led the race overall due to the amount of time he was ahead of Berger before the race was stopped). Hill, from third, made contact attempting to overtake Schumacher at the Tosa corner, dropping Hill {{to the back of the}} field {{and was forced to}} make a pitstop in order to fit a new nose cone. Hill battled back to finish in sixth position.|$|E
5|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles offer users {{the opportunity to}} sell electricity stored in their batteries back to the power grid, thereby helping utilities to operate more efficiently {{in the management of}} their demand peaks. A vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system would take advantage of the fact that most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time. During such idle times the electricity stored in the batteries could be transferred from the PEV to the power lines and back to <b>the</b> <b>grid.</b> In the U.S this transfer back to <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> have an estimated value to the utilities of up to $4,000 per year per car. In a V2G system it would also be expected that battery electric (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would have the capability to communicate automatically with the power grid to sell demand response services by either delivering electricity into <b>the</b> <b>grid</b> or by throttling their charging rate.|$|E
