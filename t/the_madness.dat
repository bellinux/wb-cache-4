5|$|The 1637 {{event was}} popularized in 1841 {{by the book}} Extraordinary Popular Delusions and <b>the</b> <b>Madness</b> of Crowds, written by British {{journalist}} Charles Mackay. At one point 12 acres (5 ha) of land were offered for a Semper Augustus bulb. Mackay claims that many such investors were ruined by the fall in prices, and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock. Although Mackay's book is a classic, his account is contested. Many modern scholars feel that the mania was not as extraordinary as Mackay described and argue that not enough price data are available to prove that a tulip bulb bubble actually occurred.|$|E
5|$|A three-part series {{published}} between November 1993 and January 1994, {{the series}} introduces attorney Beck as a love interest for Brock. When Beck pursues {{a lawsuit against}} Scarmore Industries for employees poisoned by a sentient liquid-mercury virus, Venom is injured trying {{to protect her from}} the Juggernaut's kidnap attempt. The symbiote is submerged and infected with the sentient virus (which heals Brock), bonding with the pair and introducing a third mind into their relationship. The virus drives Brock insane (causing him to murder a cleaning lady), and he is physically transported to the realm of insanity to confront its avatars: Paranoia, Dusk and the Necromancer. The symbiote overcomes the virus; Brock regains his senses, and Venom is returned to earth. Beck later insists on only being Brock's friend, because his romantic feelings for her make him more violent. Among DCD's 300 bestselling issues of 1993 Venom: <b>The</b> <b>Madness</b> #1 was number 173; the remaining issues did not chart.|$|E

5|$|Madness {{were not}} only running their own label at the time, but also had their own {{recording}} studio, Liquidator Studios. The studio is still located on Caledonian Road in North London, in {{what was once the}} premises of their fan club office. They built a 24-track professional studio in the cellar. The ground floor has always been an office and chill out area, while a room upstairs is used for song mixing. The band have recorded a number of demos and b-sides at Liquidator, as well as <b>The</b> <b>Madness</b> album in 1988. Other acts to use the studio include Feargal Sharkey, The Farm, Apollo 440, The Potato 5, The Nutty Boys, The Deltones and The Butterfield 8. The studio is still regularly used by musicians, including members of Madness themselves.|$|E
5|$|Plans were {{underway}} for {{a second}} series as early as January 2011. Citing ratings success for the first series, Sky officially renewed Mad Dogs {{for a second}} series of four episodes, which would also be written by Cris Cole. Beesley, Glenister, Simm, and Warren would reprise their roles, with filming taking place over summer 2011 and broadcast in January 2012. Sometime after the second series finished filming in August 2011, Sky commissioned a third series, which began filming in January 2012. A final two-part fourth series was commissioned in January 2013. The third series began airing in June 2013, and the fourth series finished filming in March 2013. On {{the same day as}} the last episode of series 3, there was a behind the scenes special called Behind <b>The</b> <b>Madness,</b> which aired on Sky 1. The final two-part fourth series aired on 28 December; the last part aired on 29 December, where the show concluded.|$|E
5|$|The modern {{discussion}} of tulip mania {{began with the}} book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and <b>the</b> <b>Madness</b> of Crowds, published in 1841 by the Scottish journalist Charles Mackay; he proposed that crowds of people often behave irrationally, and tulip mania was, along with the South Sea Bubble and the Mississippi Company scheme, one of his primary examples. His account was largely sourced from a 1797 work by Johann Beckmann titled A History of Inventions, Discoveries, and Origins. In fact, Beckmann's account, and thus Mackay's by derivation, was primarily sourced to three anonymous pamphlets published in 1637 with an anti-speculative agenda. Mackay's vivid book was popular among generations of economists and stock market participants. His popular but flawed description of tulip mania as a speculative bubble remains prominent, even though since the 1980s economists have debunked many aspects of his account.|$|E

5|$|The quest {{begins when}} Link is {{chosen by the}} king of Hyrule to seek {{the help of the}} Picori after Vaati had {{destroyed}} the Picori Blade and petrified Princess Zelda. With the blade shattered, evil monsters were released into Hyrule and Vaati was able to create chaos in his search for the Light Force. Link was chosen because only children can see the Picori. On the voyage he rescues Ezlo, a strange being resembling a green cap with a bird-like head, who joins him and can make Link shrink {{to the size of the}} Minish. Although it is not revealed at first, he and Vaati are Minish (Picori)—Ezlo a renowned sage and craftsman and Vaati his apprentice. Vaati became corrupted by <b>the</b> <b>madness</b> and hatred of men and took a magic hat Ezlo had made for the people in Hyrule. The hat grants any wish made by the bearer, and Vaati wished to become a powerful sorcerer. Vaati then turned his old master, who had tried to stop them, into a hat. With the help of Ezlo, Link retrieves the four elemental artifacts and uses them to restore the Picori Blade to the Four Sword, capable of defeating Vaati.|$|E
