5|$|In South America, dire wolves {{have been}} dated younger than 17,000 YBP and {{reported}} from only three localities: Muaco in Falcón state, Venezuela; Talara Province in Peru; and Tarija Department in Bolivia. If the dire wolf originated in North America, the species likely dispersed into South America via the Andean corridor, a proposed pathway for temperate mammals to migrate from Central to South America {{because of the}} favorable cool, dry, and open habitats that characterized the region at times. This most likely happened during a glacial period because the pathway then consisted of open, arid regions and savanna, whereas during inter-glacial periods it would have consisted of <b>tropical</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest.</b>|$|E

40|$|Concern {{about the}} future of <b>tropical</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> has largely focused on threats to the {{survival}} of the extraordinary biological diversity that characterizes these ecosystems. Another perspective emphasizes the role that <b>tropical</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> play in the global carbon cycle. Despite covering only about 8 % of the land surface, <b>tropical</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> are thought to contain about 40 % of the terrestrial biomass and account for over 50 % of the annual net primary productivity of the biosphere (Williams et al., 1998). Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that unlogged <b>tropical</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> act as a sink of anthropogenic carbon emissions (Grace et al., 1995). Conversely, the destruction of <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> by land clearance and forest fires is a significant source of CO 2, a point dramatically highlighted by the recent massive fires that have occurred in <b>tropical</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> worldwide (Malingreau et al., 1985; Brown, 1998). The purpose of this review is to report current research concerning the factors that influence carbon dynamics in <b>tropical</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forests...</b>|$|R

25|$|Haptanthus hazlettii {{has only}} been found {{in a very small}} area of <b>tropical</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> on the {{northern}} coast of Honduras, close to Matarras in the Arizona Municipality. After the original specimen was collected in 1989, numerous attempts were made to find the species again but without success; the area had become covered with grass following tree clearance. It was thought that the species was perhaps extinct. In 2010 an expedition organized by Alexey Shipunov and Ekaterina Shipunova found a single tree 2km from the original collection point. A few more were later found nearby. Work to conserve the species is being led by the Lancetilla Botanical Garden of Tela, Honduras.|$|E

25|$|El Mirador {{was by far}} {{the most}} {{populated}} city in pre-Columbian America. Both the El Tigre and Monos pyramids encompass a volume greater than 250,000 cubic meters. Richard Hansen, the director of the archaeological project of the Mirador Basin, believes the Maya at Mirador Basin developed the first politically organized state in America around 1500BC, named the Kan Kingdom in ancient texts. There were 26 cities, all connected by sacbeob (highways), which were several kilometers long, up to 40 meters wide, and two to four meters above the ground, paved with stucco.

25|$|Landforms {{present in}} this region include the upland terra firme (non-flooded) mostly on nutrient-poor {{lateritic}} soils, ancient alluvial plains (mostly non-flooded) on nutrient-rich soils, and present alluvial plains (várzea, seasonally flooded) of super-rich sediments renewed with each annual flood. Floristically, distinct lowland humid forest types occur {{on each of these}} landforms with the terra firme mature forests and late successional, seasonally flooded forest being the two major types. Permanent swamp forests are common on the alluvial plains. Pockets of nutrient-poor white sand soils are found here that host forests of lower height, a more open forest canopy, and lower alpha diversity, but with many endemics. The forests are mostly dense <b>tropical</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest,</b> but some patches of open forest exist.|$|E
25|$|Further {{evidence}} of waterway transformation {{is found in}} Igarapé Guariba in Brazil. It is an area in the Amazon basin where people have intervened in nature to change rivers and streams with dramatic results. Researcher Hugh Raffles notes that British naturalists Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace noted waterway transformation as they sailed through a canal close {{to the town of}} Igarapé-Miri in 1848. Archival materials identifies that it had been dug out by slaves. In his studies he notes an abundance of documentary and anecdotal evidence which supports landscape transformation by the manipulation of waterways. Transformation continues in more recent times as noted when in 1961, a group of villagers from Igarapé Guariba cut a canal about two miles (3km) long across fields thick with tall papyrus grass and into dense <b>tropical</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest.</b> The narrow canal and the stream that flowed into it have since formed a full-fledged river more than six hundred yards wide at its mouth, and the landscape {{in this part of the}} northern Brazilian state of Amapá was dramatically transformed.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, the Soviet {{territory}} contained all {{the major}} vegetation zones {{with the exception of}} <b>tropical</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest.</b> Ten percent of Soviet territory is tundra, that is, a treeless marshy plain. The tundra was the Soviet Union's northernmost zone of snow and ice, stretching from the Finnish border in the west to the Bering Strait in the east and then running south along the Pacific coast to the earthquake and volcanic region of northern Kamchatka Peninsula. It was the land made famous by herds of wild reindeer, by white nights (dusk at midnight, dawn shortly thereafter) in summer, and by days of total darkness in winter. The long harsh winters and lack of sunshine allowed only mosses, lichens, and dwarf willows and shrubs to sprout low above the barren permafrost. Although the great Siberian rivers slowly traversed this zone in reaching the Arctic Ocean, drainage of the numerous lakes, ponds, and swamps was hampered by partial and intermittent thawing. Frost weathering is the most important physical process here, shaping a landscape modified by extensive glaciation in the last ice age.|$|E
500|$|For the 3,200-seat design, Pflueger {{took his}} {{inspiration}} from Green Mansions, a romantic fantasy novel by William Henry Hudson {{set in the}} Guyana jungle of Venezuela. <b>Tropical</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> motifs were used throughout the theater, including climbing vines, waterfalls, parrots and emerald green lighting. As with his other works, Pflueger mixed together sources from around the world, adding images of Greek and Egyptian gods and goddesses as well as Egyptian lotuses to the primarily jungle theme. Plans were complete in November and in December 1930 ground was broken in a ceremony that called for [...] "prosperity celebration".|$|E
500|$|The region drained by the Congo River covers one {{eighth of}} Africa, {{including}} both <b>tropical</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> and savanna, {{much of it}} in a huge, shallow basin. The present system of rivers seems to date from around five million years ago, not long ago on a geological time scale. At that time the Atlantic continental margin was lifted up and formed a barrier between the basin and the sea. A large lake formed before the Congo River broke through this barrier, running through a narrow, rocky channel about [...] long from Kinshasa to Matadi. The river is navigable both above and below this stretch, called the lower Congo.|$|E
