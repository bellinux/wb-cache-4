25|$|The <b>trumpeter</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> maculata, (also {{known as}} the winter whiting or diver whiting) is a common species of coastal marine fish of the smelt-whiting family, Sillaginidae. The trumpeter whiting is endemic to Australia, inhabiting the eastern seaboard from {{southern}} New South Wales to northern Queensland. The species is found in bays, estuaries, coastal lakes and mangrove creeks on silty and muddy substrates in waters ranging from 0 to 30 m deep, occasionally inhabiting sandy and seagrass beds.|$|R
25|$|The oriental trumpeter whiting {{was first}} officially {{identified}} and named Sillago aeolus by Jordan and Evermann in 1902 from the holotype collected in Taiwan, {{after a number}} of taxonomists had misidentified the species as Sillago macrolepis (Bleeker) or Sillago maculata (Quoy & Gaimard, 1824). S. aeolus has a number of common names in different countries, with the most common, oriental trumpeter whiting derived from the fact the species has a similar colour and pattern to the <b>Trumpeter</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> maculata. Other names commonly applied to S. aeolus include Hoshi-gisu (Japan), Ebi (Malaysia), Oso-so (Philippines) and 'Asuhos'.|$|R
25|$|The oriental <b>trumpeter</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> aeolus, is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} species of benthic inshore fish in the smelt-whiting family. The species ranges from east Africa to Japan, inhabiting much if the southern Asian and Indonesian coastlines. Its morphology {{is very similar to}} other species within the genus Sillago, with a long, compressed body and silvery overall colour. It can be distinguished from its relatives by colour patterns and particularly swim bladder morphology, which helps define most species of Sillago. S aeolus is a benthic predator, consuming a variety of crustaceans and polychaetes. As with most members of the smelt whiting family, it is important to small coastal fisheries in various areas of its range.|$|R
50|$|The western <b>trumpeter</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> burrus, is {{a species}} of marine fish of the smelt whiting family Sillaginidae that is {{commonly}} found along the northern coast of Australia and in southern Indonesia and New Guinea. As its name suggests, it {{is closely related to}} and resembles the trumpeter whiting which inhabits the east coast of Australia and is distinguishable by swim bladder morphology alone. The species inhabits a variety of sandy, silty and muddy substrates in depths from 0 to 15 m deep, with older fish inhabiting deeper waters. Western trumpeter whiting are benthic carnivores which take predominantly crustaceans and polychaetes as prey. The species reaches sexual maturity {{at the end of its}} first year of age, spawning in batches between December and February The species is taken as bycatch with other species of whiting and shrimps in Australia.|$|R
40|$|The conspicuous, red harpacticoid Metis holothuriae {{grows to}} a large size (∼ 600 μm length) and {{accounts}} for 29. 51 % of the numerical meiofaunal abundance within blooms of the toxic, benthic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula. Despite this, the meiobenthic juvenile <b>trumpeter</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> maculata, consume M. holothuriae at only 2. 16 % of numerical meiofaunal biomass within simulated blooms, despite their apparent ease of predation. We compared the predation rates of copepods that had been dyed red (primarily Canuellidae and not known to be toxic) to M. holothuriae by S. maculata, to assess whether avoidance by predators is possibly a response to an aposematic signal conveyed by the colouration of the copepods and reinforced by their potential toxicity from exposure to L. majuscula. M. holothuriae were again strongly avoided, with only 6. 25 % of M. holothuriae consumed, whereas dyed copepods were consumed with relative alacrity, indicating that predation was not deterred by colouration alone. M. holothuriae copepodites were consumed in preference to adult individuals, supporting the idea that toxin accumulation or other factors relating to maturation might explain avoidance by benthivorous fishes...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{concerns}} about the ecological impacts of ongoing and possibly worsening blooms of the toxic, carcinogenic cyanobacteria Lyngbya majuscula in Moreton Bay, Australia, led us to assess differences in meiofaunal prey assemblages between bloom and non-bloom substrates and the potential dietary impacts of dense L. majuscula blooms on the omnivorous benthivore, the Eastern Long-finned Goby, Favonigobius lentiginosus and the obligate meiobenthivorous juveniles of <b>Trumpeter</b> Whiting, <b>Sillago</b> maculata. Marked differences in invertebrate communities were found between sandy and L. majuscula bloom foraging substrates, with copepods significantly more abundant (18. 49 % vs. 70. 44 % numerical abundance) and nematodes significantly less abundant (55. 91 % vs. 1. 21 % numerical abundance) within bloom material. Gut analyses showed that bentho-planktivorous fishes exposed to L. majuscula in captivity had consumed a significantly greater quantity of prey by both total number (P < 0. 0019) and volume (P < 0. 0006) than fish exposed to sand treatments. Thus, it is likely for such fishes that L. majuscula blooms increase rates of prey encounter and consumption, with consequent changes in trophic relationships through shifts in predator-prey interactions between small benthivorous fishes and their meiofaunal prey...|$|R
