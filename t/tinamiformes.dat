I registered highest number of tinamous using transects of 200 m. Tinamus major was mainly found in primary forest, where it was very hard to observe, and in an abandoned agroforestry system, where it was very tolerant to the presence of humans. It was observed solitary or in group of up to five adult individuals.

40|$|A novel {{family of}} {{repetitive}} DNA sequences was molecularly cloned from ApaI-digested genomic DNA of two Galliformes species, Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) and guinea fowl (Numida meleagris), and characterized by chromosome in-situ hybridization and filter hybridization. Both the repeated sequence elements produced intensely painted signals on the W chromosomes, whereas they weakly hybridized to whole chromosomal regions as interspersed-type repetitive sequences. The repeated {{elements of the}} two species had high similarity of nucleotide sequences, and cross-hybridized to chromosomes of two other Galliformes species, chicken (Gallus gallus) and blue-breasted quail (Coturnix chinensis). The nucleotide sequences were conserved in three other orders of Neognathous birds, the Strigiformes, Gruiformes and Falconiformes, but not in Palaeognathous birds, the Struthioniformes and <b>Tinamiformes,</b> indicating that the repeated sequence elements were amplified on the W chromosomes in the lineage of Neognathous birds after the common ancestor diverged into the Palaeognathae and Neognathae.

40|$|To {{clarify the}} process of avian sex {{chromosome}} differentiation in palaeognathous birds, we performed molecular and cytogenetic characterization of W chromosome-specific repetitive DNA sequences for elegant crested tinamou (Eudromia elegans, <b>Tinamiformes)</b> and constructed comparative cytogenetic maps of the Z and W chromosomes with nine chicken Z-linked gene homologues for E. elegans and ostrich (Struthio camelus, Struthioniformes). A novel family of W-specific repetitive sequences isolated from E. elegans {{was found to be}} composed of guanine- and cytosine-rich 293 -bp elements that were tandemly arrayed in the genome as satellite DNA. No nucleotide sequence homologies were found for the Struthioniformes and neognathous birds. The comparative cytogenetic maps of the Z and W chromosomes of E. elegans and S. camelus revealed that there are partial deletions in the proximal regions of the W chromosomes in the two species, and the W chromosome is more differentiated in E. elegans than in S. camelus. These results suggest that a deletion firstly occurred in the proximal region close to the centromere of the acrocentric proto-W chromosome and advanced toward the distal region.

40|$|Palaeognathous birds (Struthioniformes and <b>Tinamiformes)</b> have morphologically conserved karyotypes {{and less}} {{differentiated}} ZW sex chromosomes. To delineate interspecific chromosome orthologies in palaeognathous birds we conducted comparative chromosome painting with chicken (Gallus gallus, GGA) chromosome 1 - 9 and Z chromosome paints (GGA 1 - 9 and GGAZ) for emu, double-wattled cassowary, ostrich, greater rhea, lesser rhea and elegant crested tinamou. All six species showed the same painting patterns: each probe was hybridized {{to a single}} pair of chromosomes with the exception that the GGA 4 was hybridized to the fourth largest chromosome and {{a single pair of}} microchromosomes. The GGAZ was also hybridized to the entire region of the W chromosome, indicating that extensive homology remains between the Z and W chromosomes on the molecular level. Comparative FISH mapping of four Z- and/or W-linked markers, the ACO 1 /IREBP, ZOV 3 and CHD 1 genes and the EE 0. 6 sequence, revealed the presence of a small deletion in the proximal region of the long arm of the W chromosome in greater rhea and lesser rhea.

40|$|Despite a {{long history}} of {{anatomical}} studies in birds, the genitalia of most avian species remain undescribed. Birds are the only vertebrate taxon with internal fertilization where an intromittent phallus has been lost in most species. Studying the anatomical transitions of the avian phallus in those species where it is still present, allows us to test evolutionary hypotheses of why the phallus was lost in the ancestor of modern birds. As part of an anatomical survey of the evolution of avian phallus morphology, we have examined some avian species whose genitalia have not been described. Previously, there were only two known events of phallus reduction in birds: one transition from intromittent to non-intromittent in the Galliformes, and a complete loss of phallic structures in the ancestor of Neoaves. Here we report three additional cases of phallus reduction in birds: a transition from intromittent to non-intromittent phallus in <b>Tinamiformes</b> (Crypturellus, Tinamidae), the presence of a non-intromittent phallus in Alectura (Megapodidae), and a complete loss of the phallus in Leipoa (Megapodidae). In addition, we report on the unique morphology of the Crypturellus non-intromittent phallus. These new records of phallus reduction highlight the dynamic nature of phallus evolution in birds. Our findings provide evidence against the hypothesis that the phallus in birds is maintained to insure paternity in taxa with exclusive male parental care, since both groups where we report phallus reduction provide predominately male-only care.

We had previously reported that pigeon (Columba livia) egg white and serum glycoproteins are rich in N-glycans with Galα 1 - 4 Gal at nonreducing termini. To investigate the origin of Galα 1 - 4 Gal expression in avian evolution, we examined the presence of Galα 1 - 4 Gal glycoproteins in egg whites from 20 orders, 88 families, 163 genera, and 181 species of birds, as probed by Western blot with Griffonia simplicifolia-I lectin (terminal α-Gal/GalNAc-specific) and anti-P 1 mAb (Galα 1 - 4 Galβ 1 - 4 GlcNAcβ 1 -specific). One of the significant observations is the total absence of Galα 1 - 4 Gal glycoproteins in Struthioniformes (four species), <b>Tinamiformes</b> (three species), Craciformes (two species), Galliformes (14 species), and Anseriformes (10 species), which are phylogenetically separated from other orders at earlier stage of modern bird diversification (100 - 65 million years ago). The {{presence or absence of}} Galα 1 - 4 Gal glycoproteins in other avian orders varied by the species (104 species positive, and 44 species negative), even though some of them belong to the same order or family. Our results revealed that the expression of Galα 1 - 4 Gal glycoproteins is not rare among avians, and is correlated with the phylogeny. The expression was most likely differentiated at earlier stage of diversification in modern birds, but some birds might have lost the facility for the expression relatively recently...|$|E

Foram investigadas espécies potencialmente zoofílicas durante o período vespertino no interior de remanescente florestal, no espaço urbano de Curitiba, Paraná. Durante o período de setembro de 2000 a junho de 2001, foram realizadas cinco coletas por estação, com auxílio de armadilhas CDC-M instaladas em dois estratos verticais, a 1, 5 m do solo e na copa das árvores (6 m). Como iscas foram utilizados mamíferos Cavia porcellus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Rodentia, Cavidae) e aves Nothura maculosa (Temminck, 1815) (<b>Tinamiformes,</b> Tinamidae) em cada um dos estratos, com revezamento das iscas animais. As armadilhas foram operadas no intervalo horário das 16 : 00 às 20 : 00 h, sendo retiradas amostras a cada intervalo de 30 minutos. Em 60 horas de operação das armadilhas CDC-M, foram capturados 1. 407 exemplares de Culicidae, sendo 1. 143 espécies identificadas, distribuídas em nove gêneros e 13 espécies. As espécies mais freqüentes foram Mansonia(Mansonia) fonsecai (Pinto, 1932) e Mansonia (Mansonia) pessoai (Barreto e Coutinho, 1944), destaca-se também a ocorrência de: Ochlerotatus (Ochlerotatus) scapularis (Rondani, 1848); Psorophora (Janthinosoma) ferox (Humboldt, 1819) e Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse, 1894).

Parks and plazas (green {{areas or}} vegetation islands) within urban areas can provide {{conditions for the}} development of populations of mosquitoes, many species of which are very adaptable to a variety of environments. The species of mosquitoes in the family Culicidae with animal hosts, in a vegetation island within an urban area, in Curitiba, in the state of Paraná, in southern Brazil was investigated. To examine whether these green areas contribute to urban populations, mosquitoes were collected five times each season (spring, summer and fall), from September 2000 to July 2001. CDC-M traps were set at two heights (1. 5 m and 6 m). A mammal (quinea pig, Cavia porcellus Linnaeus, 1758, Rodentia, Cavidae) and bird (Nothura maculosa (Temminck, 1815), <b>Tinamiformes,</b> Tinamidae) were used as bait. Traps were active from 16 : 00 to 20 : 00 h, with samples taken every 30 minutes. A total of 1, 415 individual mosquitoes were collected, in 9 genera and 11 species, with 44 % of the individuals taken in Spring samples, 40 % in Summer and 16 % in Fall samples. The 1. 5 m traps with mammal bait captured the most mosquitoes (41 %), with the 6 m trap with bird bait being second (30 %), followed by 1. 5 m and bird bait (19 %) and 6 m and mammal bait (10 %). Mansonia (Mansonia) fonsecai (Pinto, 1932) and Mansonia (Mansonia) pessoai (Barreto e Coutinho, 1944) was the most common species found with both baits. Other species captured were: Mansonia (Mansonia) wilsoni (Barreto & Coutinho, 1944); Mansonia (Mansonia) titillans (Walker, 1848); Culex (Culex) acharistus Root, 1927; Culex (Culex) sp.; Wyomyia (Phoniomyia) quasilongirostris Theobald, 1907; Ochlerotatus (Ochlerotatus) scapularis (Rondani, 1848); Psorophora (Janthinosoma) ferox (Humboldt, 1819); Culex (Melanoconion) sp.; Coquillettidia (Rhynchotaenia) venezuelensis (Theobald, 1912); Aedeomyia (Aedeomyia) squamipennis (Lynch Arribálzaga, 1878); Ochlerotatus (Ochlerotatus) serratus (Theobald, 1901); Limatus durhami Theobald, 1901 and Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse, 1894). This last species has a great epidemiological importance.

40|$|The {{origin and}} {{relationships}} of the tinamous (Order <b>Tinamiformes),</b> ratites (Order Struthioniformes, Rheiformes, Casuariiformes, Apterygiformes) and birds {{of the order}} Galliformes and Anseriformes {{is the subject of}} much debate and {{it has been suggested that}} the ultrastructural analysis of a wide variety of avian sperm may provide information relevant to this problem. This paper describes the fine structure of ostrich sperm and compares the results with published information for other non-passerine birds. Ostrich sperm display a short, conical acrosome which covers the tapered tip of the long, cylindrical nucleus. A nuclear invagination housing an acrosomal rod extends deep within the karyoplasm. A centriolar complex is situated beneath the head and consists of a short proximal centriole and a long (3, 0 μm) distal centriole which extends the complete length of the midpiece. The central cavity of the distal centriole contains a pair of microtubules embedded in a rod of electron-dense material. The midpiece is surrounded by a mitochondrial sheath. Concentrations of fine granular material are present between the mitochondria. The principal-piece of the tail is demarcated from the midpiece by a distinct annulus and characterized by a ribbed fibrous sheath enclosing a typical axoneme. Rudimentary coarse fibres are observed between the fibrous sheath and the doublet microtubules of the axoneme in the proximal region of the principal-piece. The end-piece contains a disorganized collection of axonemal microtubules. Ostrich sperm differ in a number of respects from that of other non-passerine birds (the absence of a typical perforatorium; the presence of a ribbed fibrous sheath; a deep nuclear invagination; the structure and length of the distal centriole) but show a close similarity to sperm of the rhea and crested tinamou, both representatives of primitive avian families. These observations add further support to the theory that the ratites and tinamous constitute a monophyletic group. The evidence presented also reinforces the hypothesis that the ratites were the first group to branch off from the main avian stem, to be followed by the Galliformes & Anseriformes. Although it was impossible to determine whether the sperm of the tinamou are more "primitive" than those of the ostrich or rhea, it is clear that ostrich and rhea sperm are closely allied and distinct from tinamou sperm.

40|$|In recent years, avian {{systematics}} {{has been}} characterized by a diminished reliance on morphological cladistics of modern taxa, intensive palaeornithogical research stimulated by new discoveries and an inundation by analyses based on DNA sequences. Unfortunately, in contrast to significant insights into basal origins, the broad picture of neornithine phylogeny remains largely unresolved. Morphological studies have emphasized characters of use in palaeontological contexts. Molecular studies, following disillusionment with the pioneering, but non-cladistic, work of Sibley and Ahlquist, have differed markedly {{from each other and}} from morphological works in both methods and findings. Consequently, {{at the turn of the}} millennium, points of robust agreement among schools concerning higher-order neornithine phylogeny have been limited to the two basalmost and several mid-level, primary groups. This paper describes a phylogenetic (cladistic) analysis of 150 taxa of Neornithes, including exemplars from all non-passeriform families, and subordinal representatives of Passeriformes. Thirty-five outgroup taxa encompassing Crocodylia, predominately theropod Dinosauria, and selected Mesozoic birds were used to root the trees. Based on study of specimens and the literature, 2954 morphological characters were defined; these characters have been described in a companion work, approximately one-third of which were multistate (i. e. comprised at least three states), and states within more than one-half of these multistate characters were ordered for analysis. Complete heuristic searches using 10 000 random-addition replicates recovered a total solution set of 97 well-resolved, most-parsimonious trees (MPTs). The set of MPTs was confirmed by an expanded heuristic search based on 10 000 random-addition replicates and a full ratchet-augmented exploration to ascertain global optima. A strict consensus tree of MPTs included only six trichotomies, i. e. nodes differing topologically among MPTs. Bootstrapping (based on 10 000 replicates) percentages and ratchet-minimized support (Bremer) indices indicated most nodes to be robust. Several fossil Neornithes (e. g. Dinornithiformes, Aepyornithiformes) were placed within the ingroup a posteriori either through unconstrained, heursitic searches based on the complete matrix augmented by these taxa separately or using backbone-constraints. Analysis confirmed the topology among outgroup Theropoda and achieved robust resolution at virtually all levels of the Neornithes. Findings included monophyly of the palaeognathous birds, comprising the sister taxa <b>Tinamiformes</b> and ratites, respectively, and the Anseriformes and Galliformes as monophyletic sister-groups, together forming the sister-group to other Neornithes exclusive of the Palaeognathae (Neoaves). Noteworthy inferences include: (i) the sister-group to remaining Neoaves comprises a diversity of marine and wading birds; (ii) Podicipedidae are the sister-group of Gaviidae, and not closely related to the Phoenicopteridae, as recently suggested; (iii) the traditional Pelecaniformes, including the shoebill (Balaeniceps rex) as sister-taxon to other members, are monophyletic; (iv) traditional Ciconiiformes are monophyletic; (v) Strigiformes and Falconiformes are sister-groups; (vi) Cathartidae is the sister-group of the remaining Falconiformes; (vii) Ralliformes (Rallidae and Heliornithidae) are the sister-group to the monophyletic Charadriiformes, with the traditionally composed Gruiformes and Turniciformes (Turnicidae and Mesitornithidae) sequentially paraphyletic to the entire foregoing clade; (viii) Opisthocomus hoazin is the sister-taxon to the Cuculiformes (including the Musophagidae); (ix) traditional Caprimulgiformes are monophyletic and the sister-group of the Apodiformes; (x) Trogoniformes are the sister-group of Coliiformes; (xi) Coraciiformes, Piciformes and Passeriformes are mutually monophyletic and closely related; and (xii) the Galbulae are retained within the Piciformes. Unresolved portions of the Neornithes (nodes having more than one most-parsimonious solution) comprised three parts of the tree: (a) several interfamilial nodes within the Charadriiformes; (b) a trichotomy comprising the (i) Psittaciformes, (ii) Columbiformes and (iii) Trogonomorphae (Trogoniformes, Coliiformes) + Passerimorphae (Coraciiformes, Piciformes, Passeriformes); and (c) a trichotomy comprising the Coraciiformes, Piciformes and Passeriformes. The remaining polytomies were among outgroups, although several of the highest-order nodes were only marginally supported; however, the majority of nodes were resolved and met or surpassed conventional standards of support. Quantitative comparisons with alternative hypotheses, examination of highly supportive and diagnostic characters for higher taxa, correspondences with prior studies, complementarity and philosophical differences with palaeontological phylogenetics, promises and challenges of palaeogeography and calibration of evolutionary rates of birds, and classes of promising evidence and future directions of study are reviewed. Homology, as applied to avian examples of apparent homologues, is considered in terms of recent theory, and a revised annotated classification of higher-order taxa of Neornithes and other closely related Theropoda is proposed. © 2007 The Linnean Society of London, Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2007, 149, 1 – 95...|$|E
