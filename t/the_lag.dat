5|$|Bacterial growth follows four phases. When a {{population}} of bacteria first enter a high-nutrient environment that allows growth, the cells need to adapt to their new environment. The first phase of growth is <b>the</b> <b>lag</b> phase, a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high-nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth. <b>The</b> <b>lag</b> phase has high biosynthesis rates, as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced. The second phase of growth is the log phase, {{also known as the}} logarithmic or exponential phase. The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth. The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate (k), and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time (g). During log phase, nutrients are metabolised at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth. The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients. The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non-essential cellular proteins. The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair, antioxidant metabolism and nutrient transport. The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die.|$|E

SquadWar received favorable {{responses from the}} reviewers who were impressed by its persistent nature and statistics tracking. While the required registration with PXO was considered a troublesome process by a few, the gameplay itself was a smooth experience with no lag at all. Other reviewers' experiences with lag were different. Reynolds of Combatsim.com said Internet gaming was laggy with ships jumping places, but LAN gaming was smooth sailing. GameSpy's reviewer said lag became more apparent on a dial-up connection during a multiplayer mission with four or more players.

50|$|Consider the following: the helicase {{continuously}} unwinds {{the parental}} duplex, but <b>the</b> <b>lagging</b> strand must be polymerised {{in the opposite}} direction. This means that, while polymerisation of the leading strand proceeds, polymerisation of <b>the</b> <b>lagging</b> strand only occurs after enough of <b>the</b> <b>lagging</b> strand has been unwound by the helicase. At this point, <b>the</b> <b>lagging</b> strand replicative polymerase associates with the clamp and primer in order to start polymerisation.

25|$|Further {{optimization}} can {{be achieved}} by designing oligos that target <b>the</b> <b>lagging</b> strand in DNA replication because targeting <b>the</b> <b>lagging</b> strand results in a higher frequency of recombinants.

25|$|Soon after inoculation, yeast {{begin to}} rapidly consume the {{available}} assimilable nitrogen {{with up to}} 46% of YAN being fully consumed by the onset of full fermentation. Because inorganic nitrogen, such as the ammonium salts in DAP, are toxic to yeast in high levels, it is never added during inoculation when the biomass of the newly re-hydrated yeast is low. Many winemakers split up the dosage of DAP with the first addition being made {{at the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>lag</b> phase when the yeast enter their period of exponential growth and alcoholic fermentation begins. In most must this is around 48 to 72 hours after inoculation. A second dosage is then often added around {{a third of the way}} through sugar fermentation and often before the sugar levels hit 12-10 Brix (6.5 to 5.5 Baumé, 48.3 to 40.0 Oechsle) because as the fermentation progresses yeast cells are no longer able to bring the nitrogen into the cell due to the increasing toxicity of ethanol surrounding the cells. This leaves the nitrogen unused and available for spoilage organisms that may come afterwards.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{the time}} lags {{inherent}} in the dynamic response of groundwater to development have been ignored by water management agencies, decades after scientific understanding of the issue was consolidated. In brief, the effects of groundwater overdraft (although undeniably real) may take decades or centuries to manifest themselves. In a classic study in 1982, Bredehoeft and colleagues modeled a situation where groundwater extraction in an intermontane basin withdrew the entire annual recharge, leaving ‘nothing’ for the natural groundwater-dependent vegetation community. Even when the borefield was situated close to the vegetation, 30% of the original vegetation demand could still be met by <b>the</b> <b>lag</b> {{inherent in the}} system after 100 years. By year 500, this had reduced to 0%, signalling complete death of the groundwater-dependent vegetation. The science has been available to make these calculations for decades; however, in general water management agencies have ignored effects that will appear outside the rough timeframe of political elections (3 to 5 years). Marios Sophocleous argued strongly that management agencies must define and use appropriate timeframes in groundwater planning. This will mean calculating groundwater withdrawal permits based on predicted effects decades, sometimes centuries in the future.|$|E
