The hormetic morphogen theory of curvature proposes that in vivo tissue gradients of such morphogens secreted by source cells determine the fate of cells within their gradient <b>fields</b> (<b>field</b> <b>cells)</b> and that morphogen-induced amplitude modulation of <b>field</b> <b>cell</b> mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation controls <b>field</b> <b>cell</b> growth along the morphogen gradients: At the high concentration end of gradients, <b>field</b> <b>cell</b> ATP generation and <b>field</b> <b>cell</b> growth is reduced.

In the second study, which is the primary contribution of this dissertation, we employ an AIT-based algorithm to quantify the complexity of information content that arises during the development of multicellular organisms. We simulate multicellular organism development by coupling the Gene Regulatory Networks (GRN) within an epithelial field.

40|$|The hormetic {{morphogen}} {{theory of}} curvature (Fosslien 2009) proposes that hormet-ic morphogen concentration gradients modulate {{the synthesis of}} adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by cells along the gradients (<b>field</b> <b>cells)</b> and thus regulate their proliferation and induce curvature such as vascular wall curvature; however, {{it is unclear whether}} such mor-phogen gradients can also determine the histological pattern of the walls.

40|$|AbstractEpithelial planar cell {{polarity}} (PCP) allows {{epithelial cells}} {{to coordinate their}} development {{to that of the}} tissue in which they reside. The mechanisms that impart PCP as well as effectors that execute the polarizing instructions are being sought in many tissues. We report that the epidermal epithelium of Drosophila embryos exhibits PCP. Cells of the prospective denticle field, but not the adjacent smooth field, align precisely. This requires Myosin II (zipper) function, and we find that Myosin II is enriched in a bipolar manner, across the parasegment, on both smooth and denticle <b>field</b> <b>cells</b> during denticle <b>field</b> alignment. This implies that actomyosin contractility, in combination with denticle-field-specific effectors, helps execute the cell rearrangements involved. In addition to this parasegment-wide polarity, prospective denticle <b>field</b> <b>cells</b> express an asymmetry, uniquely recognizing one cell edge over others as these cells uniquely position their actin-based protrusions (ABPs; which comprise each denticle) at their posterior edge. Cells of the prospective smooth field appear to be lacking proper effectors to elicit this unipolar response. Lastly, we identify fringe function as a necessary effector for high fidelity placement of ABPs and show that Myosin II (zipper) activity is necessary for ABP placement and shaping as well...|$|R

Previous studies of this operator {{have revealed that}} its effect on gluon scattering is surprisingly difficult to detect. In this article, we analyze the impact of $G^ 3 $ upon top quark pair production. We find that it will generate observable cross section deviations from QCD at the LHC for even relatively small values of its coefficient. Furthermore, $G^ 3 $ affects the transverse momentum distribution of the produced top quarks more strongly at high energies than dimension- 6 four-quark and chromomagnetic moment terms in the effective Lagrangian. Top-antitop production at the LHC will therefore provide a sensitive and clean probe for the elusive <b>triple</b> gluon <b>field</b> strength operator.

40|$|How animals {{establish}} {{spatial pattern}} {{is a central}} question in developmental biology. Our objective was to describe the developmental specification and cell biological events that allow coordination of actin-based protrusions, called denticles, to be patterned in the embryonic ventral epidermis of Drosophila melanogaster. To better understand the developmental signals specifying denticle <b>field</b> <b>cell</b> diversity, we characterized molecular events regulating the EGF receptor activation domain. During segmental patterning, distinct signaling territories are established that employ the Hedgehog, Spitz, Serrate or the Wingless ligands. Spitz activates the EGF receptor to yield denticle instead of smooth cell fates. We showed that the main role for Serrate is to adjust the Spitz signaling domain. Serrate activated the Notch receptor in a discrete domain that broadened the expression domain of the protease Rhomboid, which lead to broadening of the Spitz domain. We showed that the Serrate antagonist, Fringe, must temper Notch activity. Together, Serrate and Fringe modulate Notch activation to generate the proper level of EGFR activation. To understand how actin-based denticles are aligned into rows, we characterized the cell morphology and planar cell polarity (PCP) behind denticle patterning. PCP allows cells to coordinate their development {{to that of the}} tissue in which they reside. We showed that cells of the prospective denticle field, but not the adjacent smooth field, align with neighbors and place actin-based protrusions faithfully on their posterior edges. We showed that these aspects of PCP require Myosin II. We observed bipolar Myosin II enrichment across the paraseginent in both smooth and denticle <b>field</b> <b>cells</b> during denticle <b>field</b> alignment. However, smooth <b>field</b> <b>cells</b> appear to lack the proper effectors to uniquely place actin-based protrusions at posterior cell edges. This implicated effectors within the denticle field for roles in unipolar PCP. Lastly, we observed a role for Fringe in the unipolar placement of ABPs. Fringe is expressed solely within the denticle field. Thus, our work provides a link between the conserved developmental signals that lead to denticle specification, and the conserved phenomenon of PCP, which allows coordinated morphological change in the patterning actin based protrusions. ...|$|R

The heart tube subsequently elongates by addition of cardiac progenitor cells from adjacent pharyngeal mesoderm to the growing arterial and venous poles. These progenitor cells, termed the second heart field, originate in splanchnic mesoderm medial to cells of the cardiac crescent and are patterned into anterior and posterior domains adjacent to the arterial and venous poles of the heart, respectively. Perturbation of second heart <b>field</b> <b>cell</b> deployment results in a spectrum of congenital heart anomalies including conotruncal and atrial septal defects seen in human patients.
