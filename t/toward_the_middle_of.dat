5|$|Cleveland next faced San Francisco at home, winning 37–14 {{before one}} of the biggest crowds of the season. Chet Adams opened the scoring for the Browns with a 44-yard field goal; he and Lou Saban shared kicking duties in the game after Groza pulled his leg muscle during pre-game warmups. On the ensuing possession, Albert had the ball {{stripped}} by Cleveland's Weldon Humble, and the Browns took over and scored their first touchdown on a Graham pass to Lavelli. San Francisco scored a touchdown near the beginning of the second quarter, but Cleveland dominated the scoring thereafter. Lavelli caught seven passes for a total of three touchdowns, setting an AAFC single-game record. Graham also rushed for a one-yard touchdown and threw for 222 yards. His touchdown passes made him the league leader in that category, with 18 on the season. It was the biggest margin of victory the Browns had ever recorded against the 49ers. Cleveland was helped by an adjustment Paul Brown made in his receivers' routes; the coach had Lavelli and Speedie run <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the field instead of trying to get open near the sidelines, as they had done in past games.

40|$|Land {{conservation}} programs are often {{guided by a}} dual mission: to protect natural resources and provide for the recreational use of a property. These goals are fundamentally in conflict, however, because all recreational use causes environmental impacts. Recreational management decisions are frequently contentious, as different types of recreationalists argue that their use is appropriate {{within the context of}} natural resource protection. Such a conflict is currently playing out in the Middlesex Fells Reservation, which is owned and managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). I use the Middlesex Fells Trail System Plan as a case study to explore how public agencies resolve conflicts over open space. I find that the driving force behind DCR's recreational use decisions is user group input; the agency takes user demands seriously. But user group desires are filtered through a variety of factors, all of which push the agency's ensuing recommendations <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> ground <b>of</b> compromise and incremental change. These factors include the agency's mission, existing system-wide policies, staff's professional judgment about the purpose of the property, the agency's understanding of the science, the regulatory framework, and most importantly-perceptions of political feasibility. I argue that the draft Trail System Plan attempts to reconcile the conflicting user group demands by accommodating each group's desired recreational experiences. DCR was unable to implement the draft plan, however, because the proposed compromise did not reconcile the fundamental difference in how user groups view and value the property. by Andrea Christenson.

Short- and long-term comparisons have been made on both GPS and radar data, covering similar time windows. Thanks to the availability of three GPS surveys the year before the eruption onset, an increase in the seaward movement of the NE flank of the volcano has been detected in the few months before the dike intrusion. The GPS ground deformation pattern also shows a slight inflation centered on the western side of the volcano in the preeruptive long-term comparison (from July 2007 to May 2008).

We inverted the SISTEM results to model the pressure source causing the observed preeruptive inflation. The subsequent emplacement of the eruptive dike was imaged by two GPS surveys carried out on a dense network over the uppermost part of the volcano on 6 and 13 May, i. e., a few days before and a few hours after the beginning of the eruption. We inverted this comparison to define the position, geometry, and kinematics of the dike.
