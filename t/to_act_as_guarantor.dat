5000|$|The Freedmen's Bureau, {{charged with}} {{implementing}} congressional reconstruction throughout the former Confederate states, {{was the primary}} political body that opposed the increasing racial overtones of Southern criminal justice during the Reconstruction Era. The Bureau's mission reflected a strong faith in impersonal legalism, according to historian Edward L. Ayers, and its agents were <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> <b>guarantors</b> of blacks' legal equality. The Bureau maintained courts in the South from 1865 to 1868 to adjudicate minor civil and criminal cases involving freed slaves. Ultimately, Ayers concludes, the Bureau largely failed to protect freed slaves from crime and violence by whites, or from the injustices of the Southern legal system, although the Bureau did provide much needed services to freed slaves {{in the form of}} food, clothing, school support, and assistance in contracts. The Greensboro, North Carolina Herald more bluntly stated that the Freedmen's Bureau was no match for the [...] "Organic Law of the Land" [...] in the South, white supremacy.|$|R

On 13 January 1874 Bergen city council started issuing stock for the Voss Line, and to begin with 400,000 Norwegian speciedaler (NOK 1.6 million) was issued. In the 1873 parliamentary election railway supporter Peter Jebsen was elected, spending {{the next few years}} furiously defending the railway. Parliament did not endorse new railway projects in the 1874 session, instead making a complete plan for all railway construction, to be proposed by a committee. When the report was launched on 20 March 1875, the Voss Line was not included since it could not show a higher profitability than 1%. During the 1875 session there was not a majority for the Voss Line, partially {{due to the lack of}} capital available for local investors. This was based on a claim from Johan Jørgen Schwartz, the chairman of the committee, that the investment costs were underestimated. This was countered by Nils Henrik Bruun, a constructor from Bergen, who was willing to construct all the tunnels for less than the budgeted sum. When Jebsen in addition was willing <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> personal <b>guarantor</b> for Bruun in case of his death, the majority in the parliament shifted. On 9 June 1875 parliament voted 61 to 42 to build the line.|$|R

[...] The report establishes that legal challenges exist for authority of the Grameen Bank <b>to</b> have <b>acted</b> <b>as</b> <b>guarantor</b> and <b>to</b> have forwarded credit to independent private enterprises during Dr. Yunus's tenure. The report raised specific questions relating to a) establishment and financing of GrameenPhone, a for-profit telecommunications entity initially established as a trust for the Grameen Bank borrowers together with Norwegian government owned multinational Telenor by Dr Yunus, and b) simultaneous management and operational financing of private enterprises established by Dr Yunus applying resources of the Grameen Bank. [...] The commission also examined {{the legal status of}} the Grameen Bank and concluded that it was de jure public i.e. government entity, of which incompetent oversight by the state and (potentially unwitting) misrepresentation by Dr. Yunus in past resulted in the popular perception of the private ownership. [...] The commission report refers to obstruction of commission investigations by current Grameen Bank management, representatives of Telenor, the Government of Bangladesh, and by partisans of Dr. Yunus. [...] Full implications of the report are thus far not closely examined in either state-controlled elements of Bangladeshi media, or by pro-Yunus press releases, where these implicate Dr Yunus as at least accessory to corruption at the nexus of the Bangladeshi public-commercial establishment, in collusion with other parties.|$|R

40|$|According to International Air Transport Association‘s (IATA) Airline Industry Forecast 2012 - 2016, India's {{domestic}} {{air travel}} market would be {{among the top five}} globally, experiencing the second highest growth rate at CAGR of 13. 1 %. India has the potential to become the third largest aviation market by 2020 and the largest by 2030. There is large untapped potential for growth {{due to the fact that}} access to aviation is still a dream for nearly 99. 5 per cent of its population. Financial year 2012 - 2013 shows an increase of revenue by 30, 164. 3 million in comparison to the base year. All these borrowings are part of Turnaround Plan to ease Air India out of the debt burden of Rs 40, 000 Crores. It would be wrong, however to say that such capital infusion has yielded no results. After the implementation of the financial restructuring plan as approved by the UPA in 2012, the operating losses have halved from Rs 5, 138. 69 Crores in FY 2012 to Rs. 2, 171. 40 Crores in FY 2015 while net loss has climbed down from Rs. 7, 559. 74 Crores in FY 2012 to Rs. 5, 547. 47 Crores in FY 2015. The airline had demanded around Rs 1, 777 Crores more than the budgeted from the current government. This unexplained cut means that the airline is distressed and might lead to deficit of government guaranteed loans which in turn will lead to compulsory borrowings from banks. If the banks are restricted to lend to the Company that is functioning at a loss of Rs 21. 71 Billion, then Air India might have to raise funds from the market at higher cost further putting stress on its already besieged. At a time when the Aviation Sector seems on a high, it is demotivating that Air India‘s prospects to raise capital from the public seems shaky at best. The National Carrier had also approached the FinMin to allow it to raise Rs 10, 000 Crore as capital in the form of tax free Bonds. The Government turned sour on the proposal and was reluctant <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> a <b>guarantor</b> in such a deal...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 This paper {{examines}} {{the role and}} depth of interstate reconciliation in the postwar relationship between Serbia and Kosovo via their interactions with the European Union. Examined within this paper are models of interstate reconciliation, historical examples of this phenomenon, and the unique position that the European Union holds {{in terms of its}} leverage over both countries. Provided first in the paper is a section dealing with the historical importance of Kosovo within Serbian national mythology, the gradual deterioration of ethnic relations during the breakup of Yugoslavia, the eventual outbreak of war and Kosovo's independence, and the subsequent normalization of ties between Belgrade and Pristina. The paper continues to examine several different scholarly frameworks for defining and identifying the concept of interstate reconciliation—that is, its meaning, its components, and its processes—and synthesize them into a useable model for the Serbia-Kosovo relationship. Explored further are the historical cases of post-World War II Germany/Poland, Japan/China, and Turkey/Armenia as precedents for future reconciliation. Serbia and Kosovo are then themselves placed on this established spectrum, and different factors examined as explanations, including a concerted effort by the government of Prime Minister Aleksandar Vučić to chart a course of European integration for Serbia. The conclusion of the paper offers an examination of and recommendations for European Union policy in Serbia and Kosovo with the aim of fostering a process of interstate reconciliation and setting the foundation for sustainable peace in the Balkans. The EU holds a great deal of leverage over both Serbia and Kosovo and finds itself in a position <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> a security <b>guarantor</b> <b>as</b> both nations learn to coexist within the larger European community...|$|R
40|$|This article {{identifies}} {{the role played}} by a series of medical scandals in the U. K., occurring from the mid- 1990 s onwards, in ending a collegial model of self-regulation of the medical profession that had endured for 150 years. The state's original motive in endorsing professional self-regulation was to resolve the principal-agent problem inherent in the doctor-patient relationship. The profession, in return for its self-regulating privileges, undertook <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> a reliable <b>guarantor</b> for the competence and conduct of each of its members. Though sufficient to ensure that most doctors were "good", the collegial model adopted by the profession left it fatally vulnerable to the problem of "bad apples": those unwilling, incapable or indifferent to delivering on their professional commitments and who betrayed the trust of both patients and peers. Weak administrative systems in the NHS failed to compensate for the defects of the collegium in controlling these individuals. The scandals both provoked and legitimised erosion of the profession's self-regulatory power. Though its vulnerability to bad apples had been present since the founding of the 19 th century profession, it was the convergence of social and political conditions at a particular historical moment that transformed the scandals into an unstoppable imperative for reform. Huge public anger, the voice permitted to a coalition of critics, shifts in social attitudes, the opportunity presented for imposing standards for accountability, and the increasing ascendancy of pro-interventionist managerialist and political agendas from the early 1990 s onwards were all implicated in the response made to scandals and the shape the reforms took. Scandals need to be understood not as simple determinants of change, but as one performative element in a constellation of socially contingent forces and contexts. The new rebalancing of the "countervailing powers" has dislodged the profession as the senior partner in the regulation of doctors, but may introduce new risks. 8658...|$|R
