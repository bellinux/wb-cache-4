40|$|This paper {{describes}} the seasonal and spatial variations of diffusive sediment- water ammonium fluxes {{in the western}} part of the Gulf of Gdansk (southern Baltic). It assesses the potential environmental controls of these fluxes, such as the inflow of organic matter to bottom sediments and its quality, temperature-induced degradation of organic matter, and the redox potential of sediments. Ammonium fluxes, calculated using Fick's first law, were always in the direction from the sediment into the water column and differed significantly with respect to sediment type. Fluxes were most intensive in sediments with the highest silt-clay fraction located in the deepest parts of the study area. The mean annual diffusive fluxes of ammonium from sediments to near-bottom water were estimated at 5. 24 <b>tonnes</b> <b>km</b> - 2 year - 1 for silty-clays, 1. 85 <b>tonnes</b> <b>km</b> - 2 year - 1 for silty-sands and 1. 03 <b>tonnes</b> <b>km</b> - 2 year - 1 for sandy sediments. There was a high seasonal variation, with the greatest ammonium release in summer and early autumn, when the temperature of near-bottom water was the highest. On the basis of the calculated diffusive ammonium fluxes, we estimated that approximately 2700 tonnes of N-NH 4 + are released annually from the surface sediments of the western part of the Gulf of Gdansk, providing a minimum of 10 % of the mineral nitrogen essential for primary production in surface waters. Our results are undoubtedly underestimated, as we disregarded advective ammonium fluxes, which in some areas of the Gulf of Gdansk could well be comparable to diffusive fluxes...|$|R
40|$|Background: CO 2 {{emissions}} from cleared mangrove areas may be substantial, increasing {{the costs of}} continued losses of these ecosystems, particularly in mangroves that have highly organic soils. Methodology/Principal Findings: We measured CO 2 efflux from mangrove soils that had been cleared for up to 20 years on the islands of Twin Cays, Belize. We also disturbed these cleared peat soils to assess what disturbance of soils after clearing may have on CO 2 efflux. CO 2 efflux from soils declines from time of clearing from, 10 600 <b>tonnes</b> <b>km</b> 22 year 21 {{in the first year}} to 3000 <b>tonnes</b> <b>km</b> 2 year 21 after 20 years since clearing. Disturbing peat leads to short term increases in CO 2 efflux (27 umol m 22 s 21), but this had returned to baseline levels within 2 days. Conclusions/Significance: Deforesting mangroves that grow on peat soils results in CO 2 emissions that are comparable to rates estimated for peat collapse in other tropical ecosystems. Preventing deforestation presents an opportunity for countries to benefit from carbon payments for preservation of threatened carbon stocks...|$|R

40|$|The Issaquah Creek {{watershed}} is {{a rapidly}} urbanizing watershed of 144 km 2 in western Washington, where sediment aggradation {{of the main}} channel and delivery of fine sediment into a large downstream lake have raised increasingly frequent concerns over flooding, loss of fish habitat, and degraded water quality. A watershed-scale sediment budget was evaluated to determine the relative effects of land-use practices, including urbanization, on sediment supply and delivery, and to guide management responses towards the most effective source-reduction strategies. Human activity in the watershed, particularly urban development, has caused an increase of nearly 50 % in the annual sediment yield, now estimated to be 44 <b>tonnes</b> <b>km</b> 22 yr 21. The main sources of sediment in the watershed are landslides (50 %), channel-bank erosion (20 %), and road-surface erosion (15 %).

40|$|Estuaries in {{tropical}} Australia {{have a low}} sediment yield (about 5 - 20 <b>tonnes</b> <b>km</b> - 2 yr - 1). The estuaries formed when rising post-glacial sea level invaded coastal valleys 7 to 9000 years ago. Geomorphological and stratigraphic data show that mangrove swamps developed on the flooded plains {{and in some cases}} their substrate kept pace with the rising sea level. The bulk of the sediment originated from the sea. When sea level stabilised, 6000 years ago, the flood plains prograded seaward. The channels now are generally stable and in some cases are inherited from the progradation phase. The response of these estuaries to a sea level rise may be inferred both from their evolution during post glacial sea level rise and from hydrodynamics-sedimentological models calibrated against measurements of tidal processes. This was undertaken for Coral Creek, the South Alligator River and the Norman River in north Australia. Modelling indicates that a future sea level rise will generate changes in the dynamics and channel dimensions which mimic post glacial changes. In the macrotidal South Alligator the floodplain will revert to mangrove, the mouth region will widen and sediment will move upstream and onto the floodplain. In the mesotidal, diurnal Norman the channel will widen throughout and sediment will be transported seawards. In Coral Creek the mangrove will retreat landwards...|$|R
40|$|Transferring {{the freight}} burden from road to railwould bring about many {{environmental}} benefits. The Rail Contribution to the Energy Review (Dept. for Transport 2006) indicated that rail freight produces eight times less CO 2 per <b>tonne.</b> <b>km</b> than road freight. Implementing this strategy successfully will require {{further development of}} rail infrastructure to cope with additional capacity. Many new proposals, such as the EuroRail Freight Route, would utilise redundant and under-used infrastructure, much of which was constructed during {{the latter part of}} the nineteenth century. Earthworks of this age should be regarded as unique if they are to be improved or upgraded. Such upgrades would require investigations into the condition of the existing earthworks to assess the materials, variability in the geotechnical properties and engineering performance along the proposed route. This paper presents a section of embankment from the Great Central Railway as a case history that demonstrates the integration of a number of geophysical and geotechnical data to assess the condition of an embankment in relation to fill materials and track geometry. It emerged that embankment structure and strength information can be provided via combined use of non-intrusive mechanical and electrical techniques such as continuous surface wave profiling and resistivity surveying. It is envisaged that this information can be used to strategically plan intrusive investigations and works to improve the infrastructure...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: A {{sediment}} analysis {{study was}} conducted at the Chini River on 16 and 31 August 2008. This {{study was conducted}} to review the formation of suspended sediment load in the Lake Chini catchment area, which flows into the Pahang River via the Chini River. Approach: Three sampling stations were chosen, the first one at upstream Chini River (S 1), mid-stream Chini River (S 2) and downstream Chini River (S 3). Three parameters were quantified for this study, namely: distribution of sediment grain size (g), concentration of suspended sediment (mg L - 1) and river discharge values (in m 3 sec - 1). Results: The findings of the study show that the sizes of sediment fall between phi Ø- 1. 00 and phi Ø- 2. 00 with very rough particle sizes falling between phi- 1. 00 and phi 0. 00. At the study area, the daily discharge value is estimated at 722, 304, 00 L day - 1. The average suspended sediment concentration recorded for each station shows varying values for both timelines. The values were 27. 33 mg L - 1 on 16 / 08 / 08 and 2. 233 mg L - 1 on 31 / 08 / 08. Conclusion: The average value for all stations calculated based on the formation of suspended sediment load per day falls between 16, 480. 4627 kg day - 1 on 16 / 08 / 08 and 1, 540. 43 kg day - 1 on 31 / 08 / 08.
