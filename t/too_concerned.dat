The cold {{temperature}} {{on the night of}} the shoot and the various technical considerations meant that the scene did not have a big emotional impact upon the cast and crew during filming. However, Renwick briefly felt emotional as he watched Victor's arm falling into the shot and his cap drift away in the gutter. After the exterior sequences had been filmed, the remainder of the episode was recorded at BBC Television Centre in West London on 17 September 2000. Unlike the location shoot, Renwick was <b>too</b> <b>concerned</b> with the complexities of filming to be emotionally affected by the filming of the final episode.|$|E

25|$|However, Weber saw the {{fulfillment}} of the Protestant ethic not in Lutheranism, which was <b>too</b> <b>concerned</b> with the reception of divine spirit in the soul, but in Calvinistic forms of Christianity. The trend was carried further still in Pietism. The Baptists diluted {{the concept of the}} calling relative to Calvinists, but other aspects made its congregants fertile soil for the development of capitalism—namely, a lack of paralyzing ascetism, the refusal to accept state office and thereby develop unpolitically, and the doctrine of control by conscience which caused rigorous honesty.|$|E

When war broke out between Russia and the Ottomans in 1877, Greek popular sentiment rallied to Russia's side, but Greece was too poor, and <b>too</b> <b>concerned</b> about British intervention, to officially enter the war.

Early {{in the marriage}} Rosebery decided to renovate the small ruined Barnbougle Castle (the original Rosebery family seat), close to, and within sight of, Dalmeny House.

500|$|With Benson's help, Walpole {{had come}} to terms with the loss of his faith. Somerset Walpole, himself the son of an Anglican priest, hoped that his eldest son would follow him into the ministry. Walpole was <b>too</b> <b>concerned</b> for his father's {{feelings}} to tell him he was no longer a believer, and on graduation from Cambridge in 1906 he took a post as a lay missioner at the Mersey Mission to Seamen in Liverpool. He described that as one of the [...] "greatest failures of my life... The Mission to Seamen was, and is, a splendid institution... but it needs men of a certain type to carry it through and I was not of that type." [...] The head of the mission reprimanded him for lack of commitment to his work, and Walpole resigned after six months.|$|E
500|$|Internet {{reviewer}} James Berardinelli {{commented that}} [...] "The Rocketeer {{may not be}} perfect, but it's {{an excellent example of}} how to adapt a comic book to the screen." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times gave a mixed review. She called The Rocketeer [...] "a benign adventure saga that has attractive stars, elaborate gimmicks and nice production values—everything it needs except a personality of its own." [...] Maslin believed that by setting the story in 1938, the filmmakers were more interested in the Art Deco production design and visual effects instead of imbuing the storyline with [...] "inspiration, which may be why it finally feels flat." [...] Hal Hinson, writing in The Washington Post, felt the film was <b>too</b> <b>concerned</b> with family-friendliness. Jonathan Rosenbaum of Chicago Reader believed both the editing and the storyline were not well balanced and felt The Rocketeer ripped-off elements of Indiana Jones and Back to the Future. Rosenbaum also cited the casting decision of character actors as being too practical. [...] "The whole thing is good-natured enough", he explained, [...] "but increasingly mechanical." ...|$|E
500|$|Not long thereafter, Hishammuddin himself apologised for his brandishing of the keris at {{the three}} {{previous}} UMNO annual general assemblies, saying he was sorry [...] "if it had affected the non-Malays".

His conditional apology was met with heavy criticism from within UMNO; one media outlet described the reaction as such: [...] "The sentiment among many in the party is that the Chinese and Indians betrayed the BN when they voted for Pakatan Rakyat. There is hurt. There is anger. So why should Hishammuddin be <b>too</b> <b>concerned</b> about what non-Malays think of the keris act?" [...] Many felt that the apology itself threatened Malay supremacy. Abdullah welcomed the apology, saying it was brave and [...] "made it clear to the non-Malays the important role the keris had in the Malay community".

Optimality of such estimating functions is discussed as well as computational issues. Maximum likelihood inference for determinantal point processes and Bayesian inference are briefly considered <b>too.</b> <b>Concerning</b> non-parametric inference, we consider extensions of functional summary statistics {{to the case of}} inhomogeneous point processes as well as new approaches to simulation based inference...|$|R

500|$|Following her {{acquisition}} of Hill Top Farm in 1905 in Lancashire (now Cumbria), Potter began her most creative and productive {{years as a}} children's author and illustrator. By {{the end of the}} decade, however, she had grown weary of writing for children. Her eyesight was failing, and the demands of operating her farm and caring for her aging parents limited the amount of time and attention she could allocate to the production of books. In 1912 however, she brought Peter Rabbit and his kin together for one last time in The Tale of Mr. Tod. She thought her editors too cautious and <b>too</b> <b>concerned</b> about offending the public, and knew she was capable of creating more complex characters and plots. In Mr. Tod she offered her fans two villainous characters [...] Mr. Tod and Tommy Brock, a fox and a badger. The Tale of Mr. Tod and the book to follow in 1913, The Tale of Pigling Bland, were her last completely original works. Her marriage to William Heelis in October 1913 effectively put an end to her career as a children's author and illustrator, but she continued to produce sporadically over the following years at the demand of fans and publisher, though relying upon decades-old ideas and sketches rather than new concepts and illustrations.|$|E

To contrast with the [...] "seven or eight minute-long songs, with seven or eight sections, and two or three time changes" [...] Grohl played with Them Crooked Vultures, he instead tried to compose the [...] "tightest, catchiest four-and-a-half-minute 'softball bat to your face' songs". Hawkins added that he liked Wasting Light for being [...] "straightforward, and that’s a good thing for us right now. The last couple [...] had some big dynamic changes." [...] Grohl described the effort as their heaviest yet, later saying it was done because [...] "I'm 42 now. I don't know if I'm {{going to be able to}} make this record when I'm 46 or 49.

500|$|Raised as {{a member}} of the lower nobility, Cabral was sent to the court of King Dom Afonso V in 1479 at around age 12. He {{received}} an education in the humanities and learned to bear arms and fight. He would have been roughly age 17 on 30 June 1484 when he was named moço fidalgo (young nobleman; a minor title then commonly granted to young nobles) by King Dom João II. Records of his deeds prior to 1500 are extremely fragmentary, but Cabral may have campaigned in North Africa, as had his ancestors and as was commonly done by other young nobles of his day. King Dom Manuel I, who had acceded to the throne two years previously, awarded him an annual allowance worth 30,000 reais on 12 April 1497. He was concurrently given the title fidalgo (nobleman) in the King's Council and was named a Knight of the Order of Christ. There is no contemporary image or detailed physical description of Cabral.

The first consisted of 160 people, including the writers Jules Claretie and Jean Richepin, the artists Albert Robida and Paul Avril, and the journalist and critic Francisque Sarcey. Uzanne also edited two magazines, Conseiller du bibliophile (literally, Adviser of bibliophile, 1876–1877) and Les miscellanées bibliographiques (The Bibliographical Miscellany, 1878–1880), {{and then ran}} three consecutive bibliophilic magazines: Le livre : bibliographie moderne (literally, The Book: Modern Bibliography, 1880–1889), Le livre moderne : revue du monde littéraire et des bibliophiles contemporaines (literally, The Modern Book: Journal of the Literary World and Contemporary Bibliophiles, 1890–1891), and L'Art et l'Idée : revue contemporaine du dilettantisme l'littéraire et de la curiosité (Art and Ideas: Contemporary Journal of the Literary Dilettantism and Curiosity, 1892–1893). In the early 1890s, he {{was considered to be}} [...] "...the best authority that book lovers know on subjects specially interesting to book lovers".

500|$|According to writer Linda Ruth Williams, {{the music}} video {{attracted}} {{attention from the}} press because of [...] "the clash between Spears' wholesome image and Dark's unwholesome back catalogue." [...] A Spears representative spoke to the Sunday Sport and revealed, [...] "as far as I'm aware the director just does music videos. This is a video for young teenage girls and not sexy at all." [...] Dark responded to the negative reviews saying, [...] "I don't deny that I did , it's just that I also like {{people to know that}} I don't currently and haven't in a long time."

40|$|Corruption {{all over}} the world is an ancient, but it seems very topical <b>too,</b> <b>concern</b> in {{politics}} and in the media. This paper investigates spatial and dynamic aspects of corruption using cellular automata. Although cellular automata are very simple, deterministic machines and thus crude approximations of real, economic situations, they are capable of describing self organization and complex patterns (of corruption). It is shown that neither social pressure nor pure economic incentives allow for complex patterns, although social pressure may lead to clusters of corrupt and uncorrupt segments within a bureaucracy. However, blending both above characteristics is capable explaining complex behavior. Extending the concept of cellular automata through mixing rules - across space (= bureaucrats) and time (accounting for global effects) - does not affect the fundamental properties.
