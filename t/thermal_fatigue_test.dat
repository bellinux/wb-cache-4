30|$|For <b>thermal</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>testing</b> (Fig.  5), no regain was {{observed}} in compressive strength after 300 cycles, instead a drastic drop {{was observed}}. For the control specimen, the drop in the compressive strength reached of 70 %. Similar drop in compressive strength of 60 % was observed with LMM specimen with high CNTs content of 1.5 %. The difference between the effect of freeze–thaw and <b>thermal</b> <b>fatigue</b> <b>tests</b> on compressive strength is attributed to {{the difference in the}} temperature exposure range. In freeze–thaw cycles, the temperature was altered between −[*] 18 to 4  °C, which helped maintain water in the mixture for late curing. On the other hand, the temperature in the thermal-fatigue test was altered between 18 and 40  °C which promoted water loss from the mixture and prevented the late curing and the regain in compressive strength. It can also be noted that LMM specimens with the moderate and low CNTs contents (i.e. 0.5 and 1.0 %) were more stable under <b>thermal</b> <b>fatigue</b> cycles as they demonstrated statistically insignificant or no drop in compressive strength after 300 cycles. It can therefore be deduced from the compressive strength testing that the addition of low-to-moderate CNTs contents to LMM mixtures yields more thermally stable and more durable mortar specimens. The inefficiency of adding high contents of CNTs might be attributed to the poor dispersion and/or increased surface area of the CNTs, which may slow down the cement hydration and the latex curing. The adverse effect of high content of CNTs (i.e. 1.5 %) on LMM subjected to <b>thermal</b> <b>fatigue</b> cycles is also evident from the high variability of the compressive strength data, represented by the high error bars for 1.5 % CNTs case, as shown in Fig.  5, relative to other CNTs contents.|$|R
