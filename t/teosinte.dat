5|$|By 7,000 BC, sowing and {{harvesting}} reached the fertile soil of Mesopotamia, where Sumerians systematized it and scaled it up. By 8,000 BC, farming was entrenched {{on the banks}} of the River Nile. About this time, agriculture was developed independently in the Far East, probably in China, with rice rather than wheat as the primary crop. Maize was domesticated from the wild grass <b>teosinte</b> in West Mexico by 6,700 BC.|$|E
5|$|In Mesoamerica, wild <b>teosinte</b> was {{transformed}} through human selection into the ancestor of modern maize, more than 6,000 years ago. It gradually spread across North America {{and was the}} major crop of Native Americans {{at the time of}} European exploration. Other Mesoamerican crops include hundreds of varieties of locally domesticated squash and beans, while cocoa, also domesticated in the region, was a major crop. The turkey, {{one of the most important}} meat birds, was probably domesticated in Mexico or the U.S. Southwest.|$|E
5|$|Ustilago maydis is a {{pathogenic}} plant fungus {{that causes}} smut disease in maize and <b>teosinte.</b> Plants have evolved efficient defense systems against pathogenic microbes such as U. maydis. A rapid defense reaction after pathogen attack is the oxidative burst where the plant produces {{reactive oxygen species}} {{at the site of}} the attempted invasion. U. maydis can respond to the oxidative burst with an oxidative stress response, regulated by the gene YAP1. The response protects U. maydis from the host defense, and is necessary for the pathogen’s virulence. Furthermore, U. maydis has a well-established recombinational DNA repair system which acts during mitosis and meiosis. The system may assist the pathogen in surviving DNA damage arising from the host plant’s oxidative defensive response to infection.|$|E
25|$|Both annual and {{perennial}} <b>teosinte</b> species occur. Z. diploperennis and Z. perennis are perennial, {{while all}} other species are annual. All species are diploid (n=10) {{with the exception}} of Z. perennis, which is tetraploid (n=20). The different species and subspecies of <b>teosinte</b> can be readily distinguished based on morphological, cytogenetic, protein, and DNA differences and on geographic origin. The two perennials are sympatric and very similar and some consider them to be one species. What many consider to be the most puzzling <b>teosinte</b> is Z. m. huehuetenangensis, which combines a morphology rather like Z. m. parviglumis with many terminal chromosome knobs and an isozyme position between the two sections. Considered to be phenotypically the most distinctive, as well as the most threatened, <b>teosinte</b> is Zea nicaraguensis. This <b>teosinte</b> thrives in flooded conditions along 200 m of a coastal estuarine river in northwest Nicaragua.|$|E
25|$|Maize is the domesticated {{variant of}} <b>teosinte.</b> The two plants have {{dissimilar}} appearance, maize having a single tall stalk with multiple leaves and <b>teosinte</b> being a short, bushy plant. The {{difference between the}} two is largely controlled by differences in just two genes.|$|E
25|$|Virtually all {{populations of}} teosintes are either {{threatened}} or endangered: Z. diploperennis exists {{in an area}} of only a few square miles; Z. nicaraguensis survives as about 6000 plants {{in an area of}} 200 x 150 m. The Mexican and Nicaraguan governments have taken action in recent years to protect wild <b>teosinte</b> populations, using both in situ and ex situ conservation methods. Currently, a large amount of scientific interest exists in conferring beneficial <b>teosinte</b> traits, such as insect resistance, perennialism, and flood tolerance, to cultivated maize lines, although this is very difficult due to linked deleterious <b>teosinte</b> traits.|$|E
25|$|Crosses {{between a}} {{particular}} <b>teosinte</b> variety and maize yield fertile offspring that are intermediate in phenotype between maize and <b>teosinte.</b> QTL analysis has also revealed some loci that when mutated in maize yield a teosinte-like stem or teosinte-like cobs. Molecular clock {{analysis of these}} genes estimates their origins to some 9000years ago, well in accordance with other records of maize domestication. It is believed that {{a small group of}} farmers must have selected some maize-like natural mutant of <b>teosinte</b> some 9000 years ago in Mexico, and subjected it to continuous selection to yield the maize plant as known today.|$|E
25|$|Domestication {{of plants}} such as maize, rice, barley, wheat etc. {{has also been a}} {{significant}} driving force in their evolution. Some studies have looked at the origins of the maize plant and found that maize is a domesticated derivative of a wild plant from Mexico called <b>teosinte.</b> <b>Teosinte</b> belongs to the genus Zea, just as maize, but bears very small inflorescence, 5–10 hard cobs, and a highly branched and spread-out stem.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} derived from {{hybridization}} between a small domesticated maize (a slightly changed {{form of a}} wild maize) and a <b>teosinte</b> of section Luxuriantes, either Z. luxurians or Z. diploperennis.|$|E
25|$|All but the Nicaraguan {{species of}} <b>teosinte</b> may grow in or very near corn fields, {{providing}} opportunities for introgression between <b>teosinte</b> and maize. First- and later-generation hybrids are often found in the fields, but the rate of gene exchange is quite low. Some populations of Z. m. mexicana display Vavilovian mimicry within cultivated maize fields, having evolved a maize-like form {{as a result of}} the farmers' selective weeding pressure. In some areas of Mexico, teosintes are regarded by maize farmers as a noxious weed, while in a few areas, farmers regard it as a beneficial companion plant, and encourage its introgression into their maize.|$|E
25|$|Genetic studies led by John Doebley {{identified}} Zea mays ssp. parviglumis, {{native to}} the Balsas River valley in Mexico's southwestern highlands, and also known as Balsas <b>teosinte,</b> as being the crop wild relative <b>teosinte</b> genetically most similar to modern maize. This has been confirmed by further more recent studies, which refined this hypothesis somewhat. Archaeobotanical studies published in 2009 now point to the middle part of the Balsas River valley as the more likely location of early domestication; this river is not very long, so these locations are not very distant. Stone milling tools with maize residue {{have been found in}} an 8,700-years old layer of deposits in a cave not far from Iguala, Guerrero.|$|E
25|$|Teosintes {{strongly}} resemble maize in many ways, notably their tassel (male inflorescence) morphology. Teosintes are {{distinguished from}} maize most obviously by their numerous branches each bearing bunches of distinctive, small female inflorescences. These spikes mature {{to form a}} two-ranked 'ear' of five to 10 triangular or trapezoidal, black or brown disarticulating segments, each with one seed. Each seed is enclosed by a very hard fruitcase, consisting of a cupule or depression in the rachis and a tough lower glume. This protects them from the digestive processes of ruminants that forage on <b>teosinte</b> and aid in seed distribution through their droppings. <b>Teosinte</b> seed exhibits some resistance to germination, but will quickly germinate if treated with a dilute solution of hydrogen peroxide.|$|E
25|$|Corn {{spread across}} North America a few {{thousand}} years ago. The original corn plant known as <b>teosinte</b> is still grown in Mexico and its size (ears of corn) has substantially increased due to efforts of Native Americans and scientific research. It is now the third leading grain crop in the world.|$|E
25|$|It is {{a direct}} {{domestication}} of a Mexican annual <b>teosinte,</b> Zea mays ssp. parviglumis, native to the Balsas River valley in south-eastern Mexico, with up to 12% of its genetic material obtained from Zea mays ssp. mexicana through introgression. This theory was further confirmed by the 2002 study of Matsuoka et al.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unknown}} what precipitated its domestication, because the edible {{portion of the}} wild variety is too small and hard to obtain to be eaten directly, as each kernel is {{enclosed}} in a very hard bivalve shell. It is possible that, early on, <b>teosinte</b> may have been gathered as preferred feed for domestic animals.|$|E
25|$|The crucial trap for the {{development}} of agriculture is the availability of wild edible plant species suitable for domestication. Farming arose early in the Fertile Crescent since the area had an abundance of wild wheat and pulse species that were nutritious and easy to domesticate. In contrast, American farmers had to struggle to develop corn as a useful food from its probable wild ancestor, <b>teosinte.</b>|$|E
500|$|Wild grains were {{collected}} and eaten {{from at least}} 20,000 BC. From around 9,500 BC, the eight Neolithic founder crops—emmer wheat, einkorn wheat, [...] hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas, and flax—were cultivated in the Levant. Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC, followed by mung, soy and azuki beans. Pigs were domesticated in Mesopotamia around 11,000 BC, followed by sheep between 11,000 and 9,000 BC. Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs {{in the areas of}} modern Turkey and Pakistan around 8,500 BC. Sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 7,000 BC. Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 5,000 BC. In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 8,000 and 5,000 BC, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Bananas were cultivated and hybridized in the same period in Papua New Guinea. In Mesoamerica, wild <b>teosinte</b> was domesticated to maize by 4,000 BC. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 3,600 BC. Camels were domesticated late, perhaps around 3,000 BC.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>teosinte</b> origin {{theory was}} {{proposed}} by the Russian botanist Nikolai Ivanovich Vavilov in 1931 and the later American Nobel Prize-winner George Beadle in 1932. It is supported experimentally and by recent studies of the plants' genomes. <b>Teosinte</b> and maize are able to cross-breed and produce fertile offspring. A number of questions remain concerning the species, among them: ...|$|E
2500|$|... how {{the tiny}} archaeological {{specimens}} of 3500–2700 BC {{could have been}} selected from a <b>teosinte,</b> and ...|$|E
2500|$|Also, back in 1939, George Beadle {{demonstrated}} that the kernels of <b>teosinte</b> are readily [...] "popped" [...] for human consumption, like modern popcorn. Some have argued {{it would have taken}} too many generations of selective breeding to produce large, compressed ears for efficient cultivation. However, studies of the hybrids readily made by intercrossing <b>teosinte</b> and modern maize suggest this objection is not well founded.|$|E
2500|$|... how {{domestication}} {{could have}} proceeded without leaving remains of <b>teosinte</b> or maize with teosintoid traits {{earlier than the}} earliest known until recently, dating from ca. 1100 BC.|$|E
2500|$|It has {{undergone}} {{two or more}} domestications either of a wild maize or of a <b>teosinte.</b> (The term [...] "teosinte" [...] describes all species and subspecies in the genus Zea, excluding Zea mays ssp. mays.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Maize is a diploid with 20 {{chromosomes}} (n=10). The combined {{length of}} the chromosomes is 1500 cM. Some of the maize chromosomes have {{what are known as}} [...] "chromosomal knobs": highly repetitive heterochromatic domains that stain darkly. Individual knobs are polymorphic among strains of both maize and <b>teosinte.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Over {{time and}} [...] {{thousands}} of years, American indigenous peoples domesticated, bred and cultivated a large array of plant species. These species now constitute 50–60% of all crops in cultivation worldwide. In certain cases, {{the indigenous peoples}} developed entirely new species and strains through artificial selection, {{as was the case}} in the domestication and breeding of maize from wild <b>teosinte</b> grasses in the valleys of southern Mexico. Numerous such agricultural products retain their native names in the English and Spanish lexicons.|$|E
2500|$|The wild {{flora and}} fauna greatly varied at La Venta and mostly {{consisted}} of seafood, deer, and a variety of small animals, as well as many wild plants. The only animals domesticated by the Olmec were dogs and, therefore, La Venta and surrounding areas largely depended on wild game. However, the rich, alluvial soil along the river banks allowed for multiple harvests every year and the land, in general, was quite bountiful. “Evidence has been found for corn (Zea mais) of <b>teosinte</b> size associated with ceramic material dated to 1750 BCE.” [...] Maize was the primary domesticated food source and Seinfeld’s (2007) study of feasting at the nearby sub-city of San Andres uncovered likely maize use in beverages, as well as cocoa.|$|E
2500|$|The Archaic period (8000–2000 BC) is {{characterized}} by the rise of incipient agriculture in Mesoamerica. The initial phases of the Archaic involved the cultivation of wild plants, transitioning into informal domestication and culminating with sedentism and agricultural production by the close of the period. Archaic sites include Sipacate in Escuintla, Guatemala, where maize pollen samples date to c. 3500 BC. The well-known Coxcatlan cave site in the Valley of Tehuacán, Puebla, which contains over 10,000 <b>teosinte</b> cobs (an antecedent to maize), and Guilá Naquitz in Oaxaca represent some of the earliest examples of agriculture in Mesoamerica. The early development of pottery, often seen as a sign of sedentism, has been documented at several sites, including the West Mexican sites of Matanchén in Nayarit and Puerto Marqués in Guerrero. La Blanca, Ocós, and Ujuxte in the Pacific Lowlands of Guatemala yielded pottery dated to c. 2500 BC.|$|E
2500|$|At the University of Chicago, {{he participated}} in field schools that exposed him to the methods and {{theories}} of James A. Ford, William Haag, Jesse D.

[...] He earned his B.A. in 1940, his M.A. in 1944 and his Ph.D. in 1949. [...] That same year, while working in the Sierra de Tamaulipas, Mexico, MacNeish discovered primitive <b>teosinte</b> corncobs in context with human habitations dating back several thousand years. [...] This achievement spurred his lifelong interest in the origins of agriculture and society that would take him throughout Central and South America, eventually to China and, nearly, to Turkey.

2500|$|Other ideas Morley {{put forward}} include the {{proposal}} that the ancient Maya {{were the first}} in Mesoamerica to domesticate maize (Zea mays ssp. mays), with the wild variety known as <b>teosinte</b> being its progenitor. Recent genetic studies have shown Morley to be largely correct in this, although the beginnings of its domestication (12,000 to 7,500 years ago) pre-dates the establishment of anything resembling Maya society. In general, Morley held that the ancient Maya had been the pre-eminent civilization of Mesoamerica, from which other cultures had drawn their influences. It is now accepted that other societies (such as the Zapotec and Olmec) preceded that of the Maya and the influences—such as development of writing and the Mesoamerican calendars—were rather the other way around; even in the later stages of Maya history, their region came under significant influences drawn from central Mexico, such as the Toltec [...] "invasion". However, the Maya did also exert a widespread influence over neighboring contemporary cultures, one which was significant {{and not to be}} overlooked.|$|E
2500|$|Agriculture began {{independently}} {{in different}} parts of the globe, and included a diverse range of taxa. At least 11 separate regions of the Old and New World were involved as independent centers of origin. Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago. Pigs were domesticated in Mesopotamia around 15,000 years ago. Rice was domesticated in China between 13,500 and 8,200 years ago, followed by mung, soy and azuki beans.

50|$|After retiring, Beadle {{undertook}} a remarkable experiment in maize genetics. In several laboratories he grew {{a series of}} Teosinte/Maize crosses. Then he crossed these progeny with each other. He looked for the rate of appearance of parent phenotypes among this second generation. The vast majority of these plants were intermediate between maize and <b>Teosinte</b> in their features, but about 1 in 500 of the plants were identical to either the parent maize or the parent <b>teosinte.</b> Using the mathematics of Mendelian genetics, he calculated that this showed a difference between maize and <b>teosinte</b> of about 5 or 6 genetic loci.
