This paper describes twoU. S. federally funded curriculum projects, Project M 3, Mentoring Mathematical Minds, and Project M 2, Mentoring Young Mathema-ticians for students ages 5 through 12. These projects foster in-depth understanding of advancedmathematical concepts by challenging andmotivating students to solve anddiscuss high-level problems in a fashion similar to practicing mathematicians. The curricula have undergone national field tests with proven research results showing significant achievement gains for students studying the curricula over a comparison group of like-ability students. This paper outlines the philosophy behind each program and its connection to the literature andbest practices in <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> education andmathematics education. Next, specific instructional strategies integral tobothcurricula areoutlined. These strategies help teachers establish a community of learners that promotes rich discussions as a platform for posing and solving interesting problems, constructing viable arguments, and defending as well as critiquing solutions.

40|$|The study {{explored}} {{the influence of}} environmental catalysts, upon <b>the</b> provision <b>of</b> <b>field</b> specific opportunities for learning, training, and practice, for a sample population of musically involved young Australians. The findings enhance understandings of {{the conditions in which}} children's musical aptitudes are developed. Research bases in <b>the</b> <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> education and music education were employed to support the investigation. Components of Gagnè's Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talent (1995 a) provided the theoretical framework for this investigation. Two survey questionnaires, completed by Australian parents (N = 194 and N = 182 respectively), sought information pertaining to the subject child's musical involvements and undertakings. Some details of the musical interests and involvements of the child's parents and siblings were also obtained. Quantitative and qualitative data contribute to an extensive profile of the types of music programs and provisions which support the normative and expert development of Australian children's musical behaviours. Parents' musical interests and involvements appear to have strongly influenced the choice of home-based recreational pursuits for their children. The convincingly articulated, positive, field specific views espoused by Australian parents appear to have been translated into the provision of multiple, simultaneous opportunities for their children to engage with musical undertakings. Notable amongst the data are the structured involvements of young musicians with music composition engagements. The data also indicate that many of the sample of Australian children received high levels of support and encouragement for musical undertakings from parents who were themselves musically interested and knowledgeable. Parental involvements with their children's music lesson and practice related engagements, were found to be characterised by features of deliberate practice. The home-based environments of young Australian musicians were found to be characterised by opportunities for exposure to rigorous and challenging musical engagements, undertaken at an optimally early age, thereby enhancing normative musical development. Such engagements provided the necessary foundation for expert levels of musical skill acquisition. An ascending progression of musical skill development was demonstrated to correspond to increasing age further reinforcing the developmental perspective on the acquisition of musical expertise. Some parents indicate that musical engagement has been pursued as a means of appropriately challenging children exhibiting the cognitive and affective characteristics of giftedness...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} patterns of computer interaction by gifted children who use computers extensively. There were two objectives: (a) To examine how these particular children came to learn various computer applications and programming, where they began, and how; and (b) To explore {{the number and}} variety <b>of</b> uses these <b>gifted</b> children have for their various computer interactions. The study led to several conjectures about the interactions <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> children and computers. There is evidence that schools do not well serve gifted children regarding computer use. As a result, many gifted children learn {{what they know about}} computers and computer applications at home or elsewhere. Further evidence indicates that, without formal instruction in school, these children have constructed their own ideas of what computers are for and what they are able to do with them. Though many of these uses are no different from the ones that other children and adults have discovered, the study found some idiosyncratic uses and meanings.

This research has the promise of contributing to knowledge in the area <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> and talented education, in that by understanding better how gifted children come to learn various computer applications and computer programming, and by understanding better the uses they have for these interactions, educators may be able to develop curricula, environments, and instruction to enhance these learning experiences in technology.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the evolution of a}} cluster concept involving primary schools that collaborated in a rural region of New Zealand to solve the problem <b>of</b> disadvantage for <b>gifted</b> and talented children. The principals formed a management committee to direct the implementation of a programme to ensure geographic isolation did not mean high ability children missed out on learning opportunities for the fulfilment of personal potential. As a collective provision, the cluster was an inaugural Talent Development Initiative and resourced by the Ministry of Education for six years from 2003 – 2008. One landmark feature was the partnership with an independent, rural education provider responsible for the facilitation and co-ordination. The literature revealed no evidence of similar provisions, so this paucity of research indicated the cluster management model was unique in Aotearoa-New Zealand. The purpose of this case study was to gain an insight from the perceptions of the principals into the ways the cluster was managed; the effectiveness of the provision; and the central ethos. The methodology was based on a phenomenological approach. Data was generated through a focus group because this forum paralleled the decision-making mode of leadership. The key finding for this investigation was that the cluster was an applicable and effective mechanism to provide for gifted and talented students in New Zealand. This success as a TDI was premised on the core principles for the creed of the cluster. Passion and commitment were essential. Professional development was critical to grow a teacher knowledge base and improve outcomes for students. Good funding was crucial to enhance talent and enable sustainability. It was important to develop a special concept of giftedness befitting the values of the cluster community and reflecting a child-centred approach integral to the shared philosophy. A significant component was the external facilitation to co-ordinate the programme and to weld the group into a cluster team. The ethos at the centre was the extraordinary spirit of collegiality and camaraderie binding the cluster together. These findings from this study confirm the cluster as a model of best practice in <b>the</b> <b>field</b> <b>of</b> New Zealand <b>gifted</b> and talented education...|$|R
