40|$|Background {{and purpose}} : Instalation of {{protective}} barrier against diagnostic x-ray is generally done {{based on the}} recommendations of NCRP 49. There are analytic methods for designing protective barriers howerer, they lack sufficient efficiency and considering the NCRP 49 reports, designing mechanical protective barrier {{in order to protect}} the initial x-ray radiation and absorption of the ray quality of such radiation is different. Therefore, the protective barrier for each radiation is measured separately. In this study, a computer software was designed to calculate the needed barrier with high accuracy. Materials and methods: Calculation of required protective barrier particularly when two or more generators are in use at diagnostic x-ray units and or installed diagnostic equipments do not have proper room space and the limitations for other clanges in parameters which are time- consuming and impossible to be manually calculated. For proper determination of <b>thichness</b> of the protective barrier, relevant information about curves of radiation weakness, dose limit etc should be entered. This program was done in windows and designed in such a way that the operator works easily, flexibility of the program is acceptable and its accuracy and sensitivity is high. Results : Results of this program indicate that, in most cases, in x-ray units required protective barrier was not used. Meanwhile sometimes shielding is more than what required which lacks technical standards and cost effectiveness. When the application index is contrasting zero, <b>thichness</b> of NCRP 49 calculation is about 20 % less than the calculated rate done by the method of this study. When the applied index is equal to zero (that is the only situation where the second barrier is considered), thickness of requined barrier is about 15 % less than the lead barrier and concrete barrier calculated in this project is 8 % less than that calculated by McGuire method. Conclusion : In this study proper determination of required protective thickness for weakening of radiation to the permitable level is proposed. The multi radiation sources in a single room are considered and non garanteed radiation of NCRP 49 hypothesis are removed. Difference between the the oritical and calculated rates this of method is X 2 = 10 - 5 which indicates accuracy and high efficiency of this software...|$|E

40|$|We present direct {{numerical}} simulations {{about the}} transport of kinetic energy and unsaturated water vapor across a thin layer which separates two decaying turbulent flows with different energy. This interface lies in a shearless stratified environment modeled by means of Boussinesq's approximation. Water vapor is treated as a passive scalar (Kumar et al. 2014). Initial conditions have Fr 2 between 0. 64 and 64 (stable case) and between - 3. 2 and - 19 (unstable case) and Re_lambda = 250. Dry air is in {{the lower half of}} the domain and has a higher turbulent energy, seven times higher than the energy of moist air in the upper half. In the early stage of evolution, as long as Fr^ 2 > 1, stratification plays a minor role and the flows follows closely neutral stratification mixing. As the buoyancy terms grows, Fr 2 ~ O(1), the mixing process deeply changes. A stable stratification generates a separation layer which blocks the entrainment of dry air into the moist one, characterized by a relative increment of the turbulent dissipation rate compared to the local turbulent energy. On the contrary, an unstable stratification sligthy enhances the entrainment.

40|$|ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (E. M. C.) measuements, {{that today}} {{becomes more and}} more important, {{requires}} materials having high attenuation level, typically - 20 dB from 30 MHz to 20 GHz. Because of their low frequency range absorption, ferrite are only efficient up to 1 GHz. The use of dispersion techniques for development of granular materials as microwave absorbers is a convenient way to make coatings with good attenuation characteristics in the 1 - 20 GHz range. Especially, elastomer mixing is a very good technique for dispersion and individualization of each grain of ferromagnetic powder (iron, cobalt, permalloy, [...] .) or ferrimagnetic powder up to 60 % (volume) while maintaining electrical insulation [1]. Such materials are easy to process by classical processing polymer techniques and can be processed in various shapes. It has already been shown that combination of magnetic material properties and geometrical effect by molding under the form of conical or pyramidal shapes significantly broadens the absorber frequency range working [2]. These absorbers with conical or pyramidal pattern, are very efficient above 1 GHz due to creation of a geometrical gradient. The realization of an architecture by combining a ferrite tile with a conical shaped ferrimagnetic granular material leads to very braodband absorbers suitable for E. M. C. applications.

40|$|International audienceThe {{kinematic}} {{contribution to}} the hardening of ultra-thin metallic sheets characterized by monotonic and reversed simple shear tests is of high interest in the sheet metal forming industry, because of its influence on the accurate prediction of springback. However, ultra-thin sheets {{are very sensitive to}} buckling when submitted to shear stress because of the large gauge width to thickness ratio, the stress perturbations induced by the clamping and the alignment of sample, which thus limit the attainable strain levels using conventional simple shear devices. In this paper, a new simple shear test dedicated to ultra-thin metallic sheets is proposed through the development of a specific support. A transparent glass part enables the application of a normal tightening force to prevent the out-of-plane buckling of the sheets whilst also allowing full field strain measurements to be taken. Firstly, the capabilities of the device are shown by comparing the mechanical behavior in a simple shear test on an austenitic stainless steel with and without the support. A good reproducibility of the flow curves is observed with the support and large shear strains are reached without buckling. Secondly, the influence of friction due to the contact between the sample and the support is checked by finite elements simulations and shown to be negligible compared to the shearing force. Finally, monotonic and reversed shear tests on a pure copper sheet with a thickness of 0. 1 mm were performed up to rupture without buckling, these were not previously conceivable on such a low <b>thichness,</b> and demonstrate the potential of the proposed device...|$|E

Firstly, we estimated intensity of Gamma ray before (Io) and after (I) passing through the samples, and then we evaluated the absorption coefficient of samples. We obtained that equation of absorption coefficient is A (water) = 0. 0014 t – 0. 4608; R 2 = 0. 9184, A (salt solution) = 0. 0015 t – 0. 4589; R 2 = 0. 8886 and A (sulphuric acid) = 0. 0017 t – 0. 4532; R 2 = 0. 780.

A piecewise-homogeneous plane {{made up of}} twodifferent {{materials}} and reinforced by an elastic unclusion is considered on a semi-finite section where the different materials join. Vertical and horizontal forces are applied to the inclusion which haz a variable <b>thichness</b> and a variable elasticity modulus. Under certain conditions the problem is reduced to integrodifferential equations of third order. The solution is constructed effectively by applying the methods of theory of analytic functions to a boundary value problem of the Carleman type for a strip. Asymptotic estimates of normal contact stress are obtained. We shall consider an elastic composite plate by which we understand an unbounded elastic medium composed of two half-planes y> 0 and y < 0 having different elastic constants (E+, µ+ and E−, µ−). It is assumed that the plate is subjected to plane deformation and, on the semi-axis (0, ∞), is strengthened by an inclusion of variable thickness h 0 (x), with elasticity modulus E 0 (x) and Poisson’s ratio ν 0.

However, comparisons are made with solutions from the literature for remote tension and bending. To reduce model generation time for each crack geometry, one finite element mesh is used to generate a model for each crack geometry for which a stress intensity factor solution is desired. In using this procedure, the original orthogonal mesh, a mesh where all of the crack plane elements are orthogonal to one another, is modified to accommodate the new crack geometries; therefore, maintaining an orthogonal crack-front mesh is not possible. The validity of the three dimensional Virtual Crack Closure Technique, 30 VCCT, with non orthogonal finite element meshes for calculating mode I stress intensity factors is assessed. Comparisons are made to existing two and three dimensional stress intensity factor solutions obtained using conformal mapping, boundary collocation, and finite element analysis. Given a sufficiently fine mess, the 30 VCCT result is practically invariant to mesh pattern. Using the 30 VCCT with a non orthogonal mesh, a cursory sensitivity study is accomplished to asses {{the effect of the}} crack profile of a through crack on the stress intensity factor.

In each two layer unit, one is thicker, transparent and composed of an assembly of calcite needle shaped crystals oriented perpendicularly to the layer: the other layer is opaque, cryptocrystalline or amorphous. According to some C- 14 datings of archaeological remains covered by the formations each couple of layers would correspond to one year. In order to check this hypothesis an experiment was set up in the Novella Cave (near Bologna) under controlled conditions. Cave pearls were chosen for investigation owing to the possibility of studying one of them without introducing any perturbation on the formation of the calcite sinter on the others. The growth of cave pearls was studied in a glass cell composed of three sections and described in the paper. In the first one, some holes of different size and depth were made in order to ascertain the influence of these geometrical parameters in function of the distance from the water drips. Small glass spheres (diameter around 1 mm) were placed in the holes as deposition nuclei. A cover was placed over this section to collect the water splash only when the water flow was measured, in order to avoid any change in the natural evaporation rate. The connection with the second section was obtained by a glass tube designed in order to guarantee a suitable mixing of the water. Both temperature and pH were measured. The third section consisted of a graduated container used to measure the flow rate which varied from 0. 4 - 0. 5 - to 500 - 700 drops/min (a range of about three orders of magnitude).
