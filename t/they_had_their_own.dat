5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} as a sizar to Trinity College, Cambridge University on 22 November 1780 {{at the age}} of 19. Trinity was at the time the richest college at Cambridge. Sizars were students who were not of the gentlemanly class, who were charged lower fees and obtained free food and/or lodging and other assistance during their period of study in exchange for performing work at their colleges. By the eighteenth century, sizars were fully integrated members of the community, who were as likely to be employed by Fellow commoners as companions rather than servants. They were expected to wait at table (as were pensioners and scholars), but by the eighteenth century <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> gyps (servants) and bedmakers.|$|E
5|$|The Staffords' first radio {{appearance}} was on Los Angeles station KHJ {{as part of}} The Happy Go Lucky Hour when Jo was 16, a role they secured after hopefuls at the audition were asked if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> musical accompanist(s). Christine Stafford said that Jo played piano, and the sisters were hired, {{even though she had}} not previously given a public piano performance. The Staffords were subsequently heard on KNX's The Singing Crockett Family of Kentucky, and California Melodies, a network radio show aired on the Mutual Broadcasting System. While Stafford worked on The Jack Oakie Show she met John Huddlestona backing singer on the programmeand they were married in October 1937. The couple divorced in 1943.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 some paving and {{the walls}} of two unusual {{elliptical}} buildings were discovered, one atop the other. These 'elliptical' buildings were partially uncovered behind Chester's market hall, and no similar buildings {{have been found in}} other legionary fortresses. The buildings were located near the centre of the fortress and <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> bath buildings and a range of store rooms around the outside. The presence of a second bath building is unusual because legionary fortresses generally had just one set of internal baths. Construction on the site began around AD 77 and this was confirmed by a length of lead piping, which served a central water feature or fountain, which was stamped with the name of Emperor Vespasian. The first building was a prestigious edifice made with concrete foundations and finely dressed stonework, and was probably the finest building in the entire fortress. Technically speaking it was not elliptical, but arcuate, with the central hall being formed from two intersecting arcs, and this makes it unique in the Roman Empire. Its function is unknown. There was no seating within the arcs, which precludes a theatre, and the best guess of the archaeologists was that the twelve alcoves may have contained images of the gods, with the temple being dedicated to the twelve primary gods of the Roman pantheon. Or, alternatively, the oval shape may have represented the shape of the known Roman world, but there is no supporting evidence for this.|$|E

The most important members of the Liberal Party of Guatemala and liberal enemies of the conservative regime moved to Los Altos, leaving their exile in El Salvador. The liberals in Los Altos began severely criticizing the Conservative government of Rivera Paz; <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> newspaper – El Popular, which contributed to the harsh criticism.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, {{individuals}} {{around the}} country became interested in nudism, skinny-dipping, and physical culture {{in the early part}} of the 20th century.

Canadians had scattered groups in several cities during the 1930s and 1940s, and some of these groups attracted enough interest to form clubs on private land.

The city is first mentioned in the Halych-Volhynian Chronicle which dates from 1256. As a major trade center, Lviv attracted German, Armenian and other merchants. The town grew quickly due to an influx of Polish people from Kraków, Poland, after they had suffered a widespread famine there. Around 1280 many Armenians lived in Galicia and were mainly based in Lviv where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> Archbishop.|$|E

His people were not familiar with the Talmud and did not observe Hanukkah, but their canon contained the book of Esther and they had an oral interpretation of the Torah. Ferrara further recorded that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> language, that the journey from their land lasted six months, and that the biblical Gozan river was found within their borders.|$|E

25|$|The song {{became popular}} immediately. Within ten years {{documented}} performances took place throughout Argentina, {{and also in}} Chile, Peru, and Colombia until <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> anthems. Different versions emerged, making mass singing difficult; several reforms were then proposed. In 1860 Esnaola was commissioned to create an official version. He took the task to heart, making many changes to the music, including a slower tempo, a fuller texture, alterations to the melody, and enrichment of the harmony. In 1927 a committee produced a historicist version that undid several of Esnaola's changes, but introduced new problems in the sung line. After a heated public debate fueled by the newspaper , this version was rejected and, following the recommendations of a second committee, Esnaola's arrangement was officially reinstated. In 1944 it was confirmed as the official anthem.|$|E
25|$|The {{environment}} at Jorasanko {{was filled with}} literature, music, painting and theatre. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> education system. In the earlier days, the women {{did not go to}} school but they were all educated at home. Swarnakumari Debi has recalled how in her early days the governess would write something on a slate which the girls then had to copy. When Debedranath discovered this, he at once stopped such a mindless and mechanical method and brought in a better teacher, Ajodhyanath Pakrashi – a male outsider in the women's quarters... Some of the sons like Ganendra, Gunendra and Jyoitrindra set up their own private theatre. To start with men played in the role of women, but {{over a period of time}} even the women joined. The environment in the family played a major role in the development of its members. Even Rabindranath Tagore who went to win the Nobel Prize in literature had very little formal education.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the Jews in Kuwait is {{connected}} to the {{history of the}} Jews in Iraq. In 1776 Sadeq Khan captured Basra, many of the inhabitants left the country and among them were Jews who went to Kuwait. With the Jews' efforts, the country flourished with its buildings and trades. Around 1860, their number increased and their trade flourished. They were mostly wholesalers and worked with India—Baghdad and Aleppo. They even exported to Europe and China. There were about 80 Jewish families in Kuwait living in one district where the Bank of Trade. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> Synagogue with their Sefer Torah. In the Synagogue, they had separate place for the women. Saturday is a sacred day. Jews didn't work that day. They also had their own Cemetery which shows that they lived there for a long time. Kuwait's population is now thirty five thousand {{and most of them are}} Arabs. Before 1914 there were about 200 Jews. Most of them went back to Baghdad and few went to India. There were two wealthy Jews in Kuwait but the rest were middle class, being Jewellers or material traders.|$|E

500|$|While {{developing}} new characters {{for the sixth}} season of Desperate Housewives, showrunner Marc Cherry and his writing staff aimed to create a housewife who would {{be different from the}} other female characters on the series. Cherry stated that he [...] "wanted someone who didn't seem suburban, who has a tough, blue-collar exterior." [...] The staff ultimately decided upon an Italian New Yorker. Cherry stated that part of his inspiration for the character came from his childhood neighbors. He explained, [...] "When I was growing up in Huntington, Calif., two Italian families from the Bronx moved in across the street. We were so WASPy, so middle American. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> ethnic identity. It was an interesting juxtaposition."

[...] "He doesn't appear as if he's supremely self-assured. [...] He's more of a regular kid who can take on the complexities of the role and become a hero". Perry was amazed by Sawa's vulnerability in acting, describing him as [...] "a very distinctive actor. He's very loose and he's kind of a cut-up when he's not on camera, but the moment the camera's on, I'd never seen anybody to completely slide right through the moment".|$|E
500|$|From a legal perspective, Hungarian {{society was}} divided into freemen and serfs, but {{intermediate}} groups also existed.

Among freemen living in lands attached to a fortress, the [...] "castle warriors" [...] served in the army, and the [...] "castle folk" [...] cultivated the lands, forged weapons or rendered other services. All freemen were to pay a special tax, the [...] "pennies of freemen" [...] to the monarchs. With a transitory status between freemen and serfs, peasants known as udvornici were exempt from it. Serfs theoretically lacked the legal status available to freemen, but in practice <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> property: they cultivated their masters' land with their own tools, and kept 50–66percent of the harvest for themselves. StephenI's laws and charters suggest that most commoners lived in sedentary communities which formed villages.

Many of the villages were named after a profession, implying that the villagers were required to render a specific service to their lords.|$|E
