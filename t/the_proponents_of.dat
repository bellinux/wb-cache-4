5|$|In 2012, one of <b>the</b> <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> {{an archaeological}} date, Felix HÃ¶flmayer, argued that archaeological {{evidence}} could {{be consistent with}} a date as early as 1590 BCE, reducing the discrepancy to around 50 years.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in <b>the</b> <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E
5|$|In February 1952, Baxter became deputy-director of the university. He {{defeated}} Arthur Denning in {{an election}} for director in December, assuming the position on 1 January 1953. As Denning had argued for the retention of the university's links with the Public Service Board, it was widely seen as a victory for <b>the</b> <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> autonomy, but with his industrial background Baxter had {{little in common with}} the professors who came from academia, and did not share their views on the role and organisation of a university. The university did receive autonomy on 1 July 1954, and when traditional university titles were adopted in 1955, Baxter became vice-chancellor.|$|E

5|$|The delegates couldn't {{agree on}} whether the {{executive}} should be a single person, or a board of three. Many wished to limit {{the power of the}} executive and thus supported the proposal to divide the executive power between three persons. The possible problems of this system, in addition to the knowledge that George Washington would probably be the first president, calmed the fears enough so that <b>the</b> <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> a singular executive could accumulate a large coalition. This issue came up occasionally after the matter was settled, but was never again seriously doubted.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{helicopters}} destroyed or damaged during the operation shocked <b>the</b> <b>proponents</b> <b>of</b> U.S. Army aviation and prompted a reevaluation of basic airmobile doctrine. The 101st Airborne Division alone, for example, had 84 of its aircraft destroyed and another 430 damaged. Combined U.S./ARVN helicopter losses totaled 168 destroyed and 618 damaged. During Lam Son 719 American helicopters had flown more than 160,000 sorties and 19 U.S. Army aviators had been killed, 59 were wounded, and 11 were missing at its conclusion. South Vietnamese helicopters had flown an additional 5,500 missions. U.S. Air Force tactical aircraft had flown more than 8,000 sorties during the incursion and had dropped 20,000 tons of bombs and napalm. B-52 bombers had flown another 1,358 sorties and dropped 32,000 tons of ordnance. Seven U.S. fixed-wing aircraft {{were shot down}} over southern Laos: six from the Air Force (two dead/two missing) and one from the Navy (one aviator killed).|$|E

5000|$|In American jurisprudence, demonstrative {{evidence}}, {{like any}} other kind of evidence must be [...] At this point <b>the</b> <b>proponent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demonstrative evidence can either try to get the evidence admitted into the official record of the case or can choose to use the evidence as merely a prop. If <b>the</b> <b>proponent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evidence wants to have the evidence included in the official record <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case, <b>the</b> <b>proponent</b> will first ask for the evidence to be marked by the court for identification purposes. After the evidence is marked for identification, <b>the</b> <b>proponent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demonstrative evidence must lay a foundation. It is at this time that the relevancy of the demonstrative evidence is usually challenged. Laying of a foundation explains how the demonstrative evidence relates to {{the facts of the case}} and establishes the evidence's authenticity. Once the foundation is laid, <b>the</b> <b>proponent</b> may ask to officially move the piece of evidence into the record where it is marked as a full exhibit. If the evidence is marked as a full exhibit the jury may refer to the evidence during deliberations and in most jurisdictions the jury may examine the evidence during deliberations. If the evidence is not marked as a full exhibit, the jury cannot do these things. As a matter <b>of</b> courtesy, <b>the</b> <b>proponent</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demonstrative evidence generally shows the piece of evidence to the opposing party before marking it for identification purposes. In criminal cases certain kinds of demonstrative evidence are subject to mandatory disclosure under the case law governing discovery. See Brady v. Maryland.|$|R
