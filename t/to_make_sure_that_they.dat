5|$|Allan Arkush and Kring {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} on The Post Show that many parts of the finale were re-shot due to the Writers' Strike. Kring and Arkush commented that they re-shot the scene in which Peter telekenetically caught the virus. In the original cut, the virus was to shatter and be released. Kring admitted that the virus being released was to play a huge role in Volume 3, however, they decided to go into a different direction and re-shoot the ending, allowing Peter to catch the virus and destroy it. Kring also commented that the scenes where Matt, Peter and Nathan were talking in the vault were rewritten in and added later, as well as the Press Conference scene and the scene with Angela Petrelli talking on the cell phone. Kring and Arkush stated that the ending had to be rewritten and re-shot because they did not know when the show would return to air, due to the Writer's Strike, and they wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> tied up all the loose ends.|$|E

5|$|The {{excavation}} {{and raising}} {{of the ship}} in the 1970s and early 1980s meant that diving operations ceased, even though modern scaffolding {{and part of the}} bow were left on the seabed. The pressure on conservators to treat tens of thousands of artefacts and the high costs of conserving, storing and displaying the finds and the ship meant that there were no funds available for diving. In 2002, the UK Ministry of Defence announced plans to build two new aircraft carriers. Because of the massive size of the new vessels, the outlet from Portsmouth needed to be surveyed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could sail no matter the tide. The planned route for the underwater channel ran close to the Mary Rose wrecksite, which meant that funding was supplied to survey and excavate the site once more. Even though the planned carriers were down-sized enough to not require alteration of Portsmouth outlet, the excavations had already exposed timbers and were completed in 2005. Among the most important finds was the ten-metre (32feet) stem, the forward continuation of the keel, which provided more exact details about the original profile of the ship.|$|E

25|$|The {{equality}} of vertically opposite angles {{is called the}} vertical angle theorem. Eudemus of Rhodes attributed the proof to Thales of Miletus. The proposition showed that since both {{of a pair of}} vertical angles are supplementary to both of the adjacent angles, the vertical angles are equal in measure. According to a historical Note, when Thales visited Egypt, he observed that whenever the Egyptians drew two intersecting lines, they would measure the vertical angles <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were equal. Thales concluded that one could prove that all vertical angles are equal if one accepted some general notions such as: all straight angles are equal, equals added to equals are equal, and equals subtracted from equals are equal.|$|E
25|$|There is {{suspicion}} that some non-fold litters are genetically heterozygous folds {{but because of}} very low expression of the gene, appear to be straight-eared. Such kittens may develop folded ears initially which then straighten back out. Because of this there are suggestions by some breeders to avoid mating Folds with straight-eared Scottish Folds but only use British Shorthairs (BSH) as outcross. If Scottish Shorthairs are to be used, they should be test mated to a BSH <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are not genetically folds. If such apparent straight-eared cats are mated with a fold, there is a 75% chance of folds (25% homozygous folds, 50% heterozygous folds) and 25% chance of straight ears.|$|E

500|$|The episode's main storylines {{revolve around}} Peter Petrelli (Milo Ventimiglia) and Hiro Nakamura's (Masi Oka) quest {{to stop the}} release of the Shanti virus, and Sylar's (Zachary Quinto) attempt to regain his powers. The end of the episode {{features}} a brief prologue of the third volume, [...] "Villains", which features Sylar regaining his powers. Originally, the virus was going to be released, and Tim Kring said that it was to play a big role in Volume 3. Kring stated that the ending had to be rewritten because they did not know when the show would return to air, and they wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> tied up all the loose ends. [...] "Powerless" [...] was watched by eleven million Americans and received mainly positive reviews from critics, with many saying that it was a positive end to a lackluster season.|$|E
500|$|The {{suit that}} Clark dons {{in the series}} finale was {{originally}} used in the 2006 film Superman Returns, worn by Brandon Routh. The producers of Smallville had been offered the suit worn by Christopher Reeve in the original Superman films; however, they turned the offer down. Peterson reasoned that this was because it [...] "didn't quite fit with our world". The final scene was shot to be reminiscent of the similar scene in the original 1978 Superman film, where Reeve rips open his shirt to reveal the Superman suit. Beeman {{and the rest of}} the production staff reviewed the scene <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> filmed the homage correctly, but Beeman later noted that the iconic scene was [...] "clunkier" [...] and more [...] "out of focus" [...] than they wanted, and that people's memories make it seem more impressive. However, he was pleased that the recreated shot was the sequence to wrap up Smallville, noting that he [...] "always thought that was going to be the final moment".|$|E
500|$|... "Treehouse of Horror IV" [...] was {{directed}} by David Silverman and co-written by Conan O'Brien, Bill Oakley, Josh Weinstein, Greg Daniels, Dan McGrath, and Bill Canterbury. It is the fourth episode of the annual Treehouse of Horror Halloween specials.

O'Brien worked on the [...] "wraparounds" [...] of Bart introducing each segment <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> [...] "pulled" [...] the episode together. The wraparounds are based on Rod Serling's television series Night Gallery, in which Serling appears at an art gallery and introduces each episode by unveiling paintings depicting the stories. Executive producer James L. Brooks loved the show, so it was [...] "great fun" [...] for him to do the parody. Show runner David Mirkin thought the Treehouse of Horror episodes were the hardest episodes to do because the staff had to fit in all three stories in only 22 minutes.

500|$|Metroid Prime Hunters {{was first}} {{revealed}} at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2004, with IGN giving the game their Best Nintendo DS Game of E3 award. When Nintendo received negative feedback at E3 2005 about the game's {{lack of an}} online feature, the company announced in August 2005 that the game's release would be delayed to give the developers time to implement Nintendo WFC support. After the game's release was delayed to give NST time to implement the multiplayer feature, the developers {{took the time to}} make more changes. They worked on the game's framerate to make the graphics move more smoothly. The game's visuals were improved; a developer added reflections to the Morph Ball. The other developers admired the effect, and added it {{to other parts of the}} game. NST collaborated with Retro Studios, the company behind several Metroid games, to design the game's art and characters <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> fit into the overall Metroid series. When asked why Metroid Prime Hunters was placed between Metroid Prime and [...] chronologically, Reed noted that the game was not influenced by the story of either game, so there were no continuity issues. He described Hunters as a side story to the Metroid Prime series.|$|E
500|$|Soule rarely gets to see {{the game}} he is {{composing}} for in any sort of completed state before he begins work; as a result he bases many of his musical decisions on the company's previous games. He credits his success with this strategy {{to the fact that}} many of the games he works on come from studios that have created several successful games in the past. He finds it much easier to compose a soundtrack to a game that is very visual in nature, such as a role-playing game. He also likes {{to see the}} storyboards and concept art for the game, as he considers them a good provider of [...] "pure emotional intent" [...] for the game. When composing a soundtrack, the first thing that he decides is the tempo and the amount of energy the music will have; this decision is as much based on the genre of the game as it is the artistic style of the game. After that, Soule starts composing smaller tracks in the soundtrack, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> match up with the vision of the game before he starts on the major themes. Soule tries to compose all of a game's soundtrack himself rather than in a team, though he sometimes collaborates with his brother.|$|E
500|$|The New 52 ongoing {{series are}} {{organized}} under seven different [...] "families," [...] grouping similar characters or themes within the books together. By {{the release of}} the October 2013 solicitations, DC was no longer grouping the titles by these families. They instead began releasing one larger solicit, titled [...] "The New 52 Group". However, titles that were not participating in an event for the month, such as [...] "Forever Evil", were still grouped together in the larger solicit by the previous family headings. In September 2014, DC co-publisher Dan DiDio spoke about classifying the titles into the families, saying, [...] "one of the things we did, when we launched the New 52, we broke those classifications up {{in a way that we}} were able to draw attention to all the characters. So we put them in groupings so we would be able to promote and help them draw attention in groups. It was never made to be a certain amount different stuff. We always want to have different styles of product... with a lot of characters, we're careful. Things like Frankenstein and Grifter and Voodoo and things of that nature, which were really risky characters and risky chances for us to take, and we're very happy to do them. Even though they didn't work, we knew there was value in those characters... We think they brought a lot of value to the launch. They brought a lot of breadth and depth to the line of books, and a diversity to the line. We didn't want to put them out and then forget about them. It was very important <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were prominent in other series, and that's why we put them in" [...] other series.|$|E
