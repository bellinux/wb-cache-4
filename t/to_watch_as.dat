5|$|The birds aggressively {{defend their}} nests and {{surrounding}} areas against other birds and animals. When a predator is persistent, mockingbirds from neighboring territories may be summoned by distinct calls {{to join the}} defense. Other birds may gather <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> the mockingbirds harass the intruder. In addition to harassing domestic cats and dogs that they consider a threat, mockingbirds will at times target humans. The birds are unafraid and will attack much larger birds, even hawks. One incident in Tulsa, Oklahoma involving a postal carrier resulted {{in the distribution of}} a warning letter to residents.|$|E
5|$|Blessed be God's name? Why, but {{why would}} I bless Him? Every fiber in me rebelled. Because He caused {{thousands}} of children to burn in His mass graves? Because He kept six crematoria working day and night, including Sabbath and the Holy Days? Because in His great might, He had created Auschwitz, Birkenau, Buna, {{and so many other}} factories of death? How could I say to Him: Blessed be Thou, Almighty, Master of the Universe, who chose us among all nations to be tortured day and night, <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> our fathers, our mothers, our brothers end up in the furnaces?...|$|E
5|$|Bradman had {{words with}} Barnes after this match {{about his new}} role as an opener. Barnes later wrote: He asked me how I liked it. I said it suited me. 'You batted very well in this game,' he said, 'but not quite as an opener. You were looking for runs all the time. I think what you want <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> an opener is not getting out... What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is {{patience}} and plenty of it.' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do.|$|E

5|$|In August 1922, Tosa {{was moved}} to Kure, still incomplete. Fifty {{thousand}} people turned out <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> the battleship was towed out of the harbor by five tugboats. The barbettes for the 406mm (16inch) guns were in place, but no turrets or weapons had been mounted, so {{the holes in the}} main deck were covered with a mesh-like material. Her hull was finished, and a superstructure deck, bridge deck and conning tower had been fitted, along with a light signal mast directly aft of the second barbette. The conning tower had to be outfitted as a bridge, as there was no other suitable location; compared with those of similar ships, it was much smaller, as it only contained two levels and bridge wings. An exhaust pipe resembling an extremely small funnel was fitted so that heat could be supplied within the ship.|$|E
5|$|In June the {{battalion}} {{was placed in}} reserve as a ready-reinforcement unit and consequently saw little combat. From July to September, 3rd Battalion operated all throughout the I Corps area of operations, moving its command post to ten different locations. Hundreds of Marines were also affected by cellulitis. Following President Johnson's halt of the US bombing campaign on 1 November, 3rd Battalion Marines had <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> the PAVN brazenly pushed large convoys of men and munitions south along the Ben Hai River. In one instance it took three days for {{the battalion}} to get approval for a single airstrike on a North Vietnamese convoy.|$|E
5|$|In general, humans {{consider}} woodpeckers in a favourable light; {{they are}} viewed as interesting birds and fascinating <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> they drum or forage. However, their activities are not universally appreciated. Some individual birds habitually excavate holes in buildings, fencing and utility poles, and there are various reverberatory structures on buildings such as gutters, downspouts, chimneys, vents and aluminium sheeting, that the birds find attractive for drumming. Houses with shingles or wooden boarding are also attractive as possible nesting or roosting sites, especially when close to large trees or woodland. Several exploratory holes may be made, especially at the junctions of vertical boards or {{at the corners of}} tongue-and-groove boarding. The birds may also drill holes in houses as they forage for insect larvae and pupae hidden behind the woodwork.|$|E

5|$|Multiple escape {{attempts}} were made {{throughout the history of}} the prison camp, but the majority ended in failure. In one attempt, foursoldiers were recaptured by the Japanese. The guards forced all prisoners <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> the foursoldiers were beaten, forced to dig their own graves and then executed. Shortly thereafter, the guards put up signs declaring that if other escape {{attempts were}} made, tenprisoners would be executed for every escapee. Prisoners' living quarters were then divided into groups of ten, which motivated the POWs to {{keep a close eye on}} others to prevent them from making escape attempts.|$|E
5|$|After {{moving through}} torrential rain, the {{battalion}} reached Elephant Point at 16:00, and close-quarters fighting then took place, with flame-throwers being used against several Japanese bunkers guarding the battery. About forty Japanese soldiers and gunners were {{killed during the}} assault, and the battalion also sustained several casualties. After the battery had been secured the battalion dug in around Elephant Point and awaited {{the arrival of the}} relief force, which landed at Thaungang at 15:30, with a supply drop following it several minutes later. As it neared the position of the battalion, the surgical team accompanying the relief force was accidentally fired upon by the Gurkhas, causing four members of the team to be wounded. The battalion remained where it was through the night, although high tides submerged a number of trenches and forced the battalion to higher ground. By the dawn of 2 May, after it had cleared a number of nearby bunkers, the battalion was able <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> minesweepers cleared the Rangoon river for the columns of landing craft following behind them.|$|E
5|$|Dagen awakens {{in a cage}} in an {{abandoned}} asylum and is told that his wife Joyce will die if he doesn't save her within one hour. Joyce is chained at the neck to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Dagen's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce. Along the way, he finds Nina, his publicist, in a fish hook trap; Suzanne, his lawyer, in a piercing wheel; and Cale McNamara, his best friend and co-conspirator, in a hanging trap. They represent the three wise monkeys and are killed despite Dagen's efforts to save them. After removing his upper wisdom teeth to obtain the combination for a security door, Dagen finds Joyce and is forced to reenact the trap {{he claimed to have}} survived: he must drive hooks through his pectoral muscles and hoist himself up to the ceiling to deactivate her trap. He fails nonetheless, and is forced <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> a brazen bull capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.|$|E

5|$|Sailors {{on nearby}} ships heard {{the series of}} signals and, realizing that a {{collision}} was imminent, gathered <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> Imo bore down on Mont-Blanc. Though both ships had cut their engines by this point, their momentum carried them {{right on top of}} each other at slow speed. Unable to ground his ship for fear of a shock that would set off his explosive cargo, Mackey ordered Mont-Blanc to steer hard to port (starboard helm) and crossed the Norwegian ship's bows in a last-second bid to avoid a collision. The two ships were almost parallel to each other, when Imo suddenly sent out three signal blasts, indicating the ship was reversing its engines. The combination of the cargoless ship's height in the water and the transverse thrust of her right-hand propeller caused the ship's head to swing into Mont-Blanc. Imos prow pushed into the French vessel's No. 1 hold on her starboard side.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter of the game, Conker and Berri are enlisted by Don Weaso, head of the Weasel Mafia, to rob a bank. After {{entering}} the vault, they find that the bank scene was an elaborate trap set by the King and Don Weaso to capture Conker. In the ensuing confrontation, Berri steps in to handle the confrontation for Conker, but is gunned down by Weaso under orders by the Panther King. Afterwards, he calls over Professor Von Kriplespac when he begins having trouble breathing, and Von Kriplespac takes Conker aside <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> <b>as</b> a large Xenomorph suddenly bursts out of the Panther King's chest, killing him instantly. Von Kriplespac explains that the alien, whom he had named Heinrich, {{is one of his}} creations and that he had planned to use this opportunity to kill the King and escape captivity. Kriplespac then reveals that they are all actually inside a spaceship, which he activates and takes into low orbit. From there, he instructs Heinrich to attack and kill Conker as revenge for destroying the Tediz, which were also his creations. Conker pulls a switch that opens an air lock, pulling Von Kriplespac and the corpses of Berri and the Panther King into space. After Conker briefly battles Heinrich {{with the aid of a}} robotic suit, Heinrich takes one last lunge at him, when suddenly the entire game freezes. Conker expresses disbelief that the developers of the game apparently did not beta test the game properly, and breaks the fourth wall to ask some software engineers to assist him in his current situation. The programmers give Conker a Katana and teleport him to the Panther King's throne room, where he decapitates Heinrich. As a result, he is crowned the new King of the land.|$|E
