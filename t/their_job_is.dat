Larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine, while terrestrial species, with a greater need to conserve water, excrete the less toxic product urea. Some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{findings}} in sociological studies of leisure are illustrated by John Robinson's late-1970s study of American leisure. Robinson found that Americans, on average, have {{four hours of}} leisure time each weekday, and more on weekends—six hours on Saturdays, almost eight on Sundays. Amount of leisure time diminishes with age, work, marriage, and children. However, the amount of free time does not significantly depend on an individual's wealth. People desire less free time if they are uncertain of their economic future, or if <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> their central interest. During {{the second half of}} the twentieth century, watching television became a major leisure activity, causing a substantial decrease in the time dedicated to other activities; in the early 1970s the average American had 4 hours of leisure per day, and spent 1.5 of them watching television. Shared leisure activities increase marital satisfaction.|$|E

25|$|Job {{interviews}} {{and other data}} on requirements for lower skilled workers in developed countries – particularly in the growing service sector – indicate that the more workers depend on low wages, and the less skilled or desirable <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>is,</b> the more employers screen for workers without better employment options and expect them to feign unremunerative motivation. Such screening and feigning may not only contribute to the positive self-image of the employer as someone granting desirable employment, but also signal wage-dependence by indicating the employee's willingness to feign, which in turn may discourage the dissatisfaction normally associated with job-switching or union activity.|$|E
25|$|Due to no {{funding from}} the state of Georgia and its limited funding from Fulton, Clayton and DeKalb counties, MARTA has {{struggled}} for many years to provide adequate service to the metropolitan area. As a result, MARTA has gained a notorious reputation throughout the metro Atlanta area for being ineffective and inconvenient. Many people who own cars avoid using the system altogether while residents in suburban areas usually drive their car to a MARTA rail station (instead of using bus service) if <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> near an adjacent one. MARTA's financial structure (being tied to a 1% sales tax) has forced the agency to cut services during times of economic depression, further resulting in complaints about the inconvenience and inadequacy of MARTA services.|$|E
25|$|Genes are cogs in the machine, not gods in the sky. They are {{switched}} {{on and off}} throughout life, by external as well as internal events, <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> to absorb information from the environment at least as often as to transmit it from the past. Genes do more than carry information; they respond to experience. Susan Mineka illustrated this concept exceedingly well with her idea of prepared learning in monkeys, where she found the predisposition of genes largely affected the acquisition of fear responses to certain stimuli. Lab-reared monkeys, through vicarious experience, were easily able to acquire a fear response to a snake, but not a flower. Nature provides the instinct, and elements of nurture depend on whether the instinct is expressed.|$|E

He presents the fundamentalists as disciplined, dedicated, and determined with [...] "formulas for success" [...] opposite [...] "fragmented and defensive" [...] detractors. They believe in [...] "one Truth"—God's plan—and reject philosophies of multiple truths. A teacher told Peshkin that <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> {{to prepare students for}} this [...] "one pattern" [...] of thought.

Peshkin describes the school as a [...] "total institution": a place where many similar people live by their own formal rules apart from outside society, as based on Erving Goffman's 1961 essay. Peshkin asserts that this was a natural conclusion from a school [...] "based on absolute truth". God's Choice was the third book in his series of studies on school–community relationships.

40|$|Objective - The {{objective}} of the research was to examine to what extent community pharmacists in Great Britain believed that <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> concerned with local public health issues. Methods - The project (Pharmacy and Public Health) received ethical approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the School of Life and Health Sciences at Aston University. After piloting, in August 2006 a self-completion postal questionnaire was sent to practicing community pharmacists in Great Britain (n= 1998), with a follow-up to non-responders 4 weeks later. A final response rate of 51 % (n= 1023 / 1998) was achieved. Results - Respondents {{were asked to indicate}} their answer to the question “to what extent <b>is</b> your present <b>job</b> concerned with local public health issues?” on a three-point scale – “highly”, “slightly” or “not at all” concerned with public health. They were also asked to indicate whether they were pharmacy owners, employee pharmacists or self-employed locum pharmacists. Less than half (43 %,n= 384 / 898) of respondents answering both questions believed that <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> highly concerned with public health. A relationship was observed between employment status and the level to which a respondent believed that <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> concerned with public health (chi-square test with P= 0. 001). Over half of pharmacy owners (51 %, n= 68 / 134) considered that <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> highly concerned with public health compared to 44 % (n= 193 / 443) of employee pharmacists and 38 % (n= 123 / 321) of locum pharmacists. Conclusion - This research suggests that community pharmacists in Great Britain are not ‘fully engaged’ with public health. Pharmacy owners may feel more enfranchised in the public health movement than their employees and locums. Indeed, one-in-ten locums reported that <b>their</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> not at all concerned with public health which, as locum pharmacists constitute over a third of actively employed community pharmacists, could be limiting factor in any drive to strengthen the public health function of community pharmacists...|$|R
