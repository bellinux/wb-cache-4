2500|$|In 1991, Gwen Resources Limited {{performed}} a detailed program of diamond drilling, geological mapping, trenching and surveying at Beanland. After {{this work was}} completed, a 3,392 ton bulk sample was taken from an open pit in January 1992 to confirm old assay results on the Beanland Vein. Equipment consisted of a Caterpillar D6, a Gardner-Denver hydraulic <b>track</b> <b>drill</b> and a John Deere backhoe to remove the blasted material. The extracted ore was shipped to the Kerr-Addison Mine mill in Virginiatown for processing. All of the ore was stockpiled in the mill yard rather than being directly dumped into the crusher and therefore directly into the mill. Because the ore was stockpiled, where it froze {{and had to be}} blasted, it was handled twice which put up the costs of the milling. The mill results were not as high as expected. It was discovered that the ore had a higher percentage in silver than gold. The cause of this was probably due to a deposit of silver hidden in the very high erratic values of gold and silver. Such an occurrence is quite common in the Cobalt-Temagami area. Since the bulk sample was taken in January 1992, it was very cold and experienced a lot of dilution of ore due to overload of holes. Because of the cold weather, the test pit had to be [...] wide. Beanland Mine has remained idle since 1992.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the walk-over locating technology used in horizontal directional drilling. It covers both {{the fundamentals of}} the technology and practical applications. The paper begins with {{a comparison of the}} two types of magnetic fields used for in-ground locating. The cylindrical magnetic field is used for locating wires, pipes, and conduits, while the dipole magnetic field is used to <b>track</b> <b>drill</b> heads. Plots show the magnitude of the signal intensity as detected by various receiver antenna configurations for the two types of fields. The paper then goes on to show the flux patterns {{on the surface of the}} ground and their importance to locating. A description is given of the various ways that different dipole tracking receivers can process the magnetic field information to locate the in-ground magnetic field source and determine its depth and orientation. The methods described include the use of magnetic field intensity, flux line orientation, and gradients of the field intensity. The ability to predict the location and depth of the boring tool at a point in front of its current position is discussed, including how this feature can be used to guide the drilling process. Finally, the paper describes a novel device that can represent the tracking transmitterâ€™s position on a display much like a radar screen so that the position of the transmitter relative to the receiver can be displayed regardless of the orientation of either device. This device uses both the magnetic flux lines and the intensity of the field for locating the transmitter, and its design appears to be the next major advancement in walk-over locating technology...|$|E

40|$|Buildings, railway <b>tracks,</b> <b>drill</b> {{strings and}} {{off-shore}} pipelines are all modeled as structures on elastic foundations {{in order to}} study their response behavior under different conditions. Flexible polyurethane foams used for cushioning in the furniture and automotive industries also serve as foundations, but they exhibit even more complex nonlinear and viscoelastic behavior. It is challenging to develop models {{that can be used}} to predict the behavior of these material-structural systems over a wide range of loading conditions. The solution techniques are also computationally expensive, making it difficult to use the models to do iterative design of these types of systems. The research described addresses some of these issues. A pinned-pinned beam interacting with a viscoelastic foundation which can react in tension and compression (bilateral), as well as only in compression (unilateral) is considered. The model developed can be used to predict the response to localized or distributed, static and dynamic forces. If the foundation reacts only in compression, the contact region changes with beam motion and the estimation of the contact region is embedded into the iterative solution procedure. The steady state solution is expressed as the sum of an arbitrary number of modes and Galerkin 2 Ì† 7 s method is used to derive the modal amplitude equations. Incremental harmonic balance is used to predict the steady-state frequency responses efficiently. Pseudo arc-length continuation technique is used to track both stable and unstable branches of the response and by using these computationally efficient solution approaches, it is possible to explore a wide variety of static and dynamic loading conditions and also quickly determine the number of modes required for convergence. The influence of various system parameters on the response of the beam on different types of foundations is studied, and the unilateral and bilateral foundation cases are compared. To verify the applicability of the beam-viscoelastic foundation model, an experimental rig was designed and a variety of base excitation experiments were conducted. Predicted and measured responses were compared and additional experiments were conducted to improve estimates of foundation material and beam model. There is a good qualitative agreement between the experimental and predicted responses but a few challenges remain, for example, for more complex foundation models and for viscoelastic materials that take a long time to recover. In these cases the behavior in the end-of-contact regions (unilateral case) may require separate models for the foundation and the beam. ...|$|R

Olivine appears to be the most susceptible to alteration and in some sections it is the only mineral altered. In other sections, olivine, pyroxene and plagioclase phenocrysts, and groundmass have been completely replaced by secondary minerals. Clays are the predominant form of secondary mineralization. In addition to replacing olivine, pyroxene, glass, and groundmass, clays have filled veins, vesicles, and voids. Minor amounts of calcite, zeolites, and K-feldspar were also detected.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{research into}} the engineering of Mission Management Knowledge Based processes for the command of Multiple Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles(MIAVs). In particular it discusses architectural and algorithmic considerations {{in the light of}} the demanding requirements for robustness and increased system longevity. The architectural issues covered reflect recent developments in Object Technology which has demonstrated the benefits of a componentised view of systems, where observation of interface standards can provide for a 'plug and play' approach to system development and evolution. The algorithmic considerations concentrate on the significant progress in the machine learning field specifically looking at combining popular Knowledge Based Systems(KBSs) approaches with those developed in the area of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Adaptive systems promise resistance to change through the modification of internal models as a result of direct experience of the problem domain, and can, under certain conditions, behave robustly in unseen situations. The engineering of Mission Management Knowledge Based processes for the command of Multiple Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles(MIAVs) concerns the coordination of elements of a distributed system so as to generate coherent behaviour. As such the techniques apply to the management and control of envisaged civil information and automation systems in public utilities, transportation and manufacturing as well as military command and control. The ever increasing demand for cost effectiveness, project efficiency and increasing productivity resulting from open competition is resulting in greater demand for coherent, systems solutions for bespoke large scale projects, such as major building construction, air traffic control and road management systems. These integrated systems are characterised by high capital value and extended life time, which together raise a requirement for evolution in system capability and the acceptance of change as an inherent characteristic of system infrastructure. The acceptance of change implies the need for a rigorous approach to the analysis and design of these systems which emphasises the achievement of modularity. In addition, since these systems often are required to operate in dynamic large, complex, uncertain, unstructured, non-benign environments without human intervention, there is a requirement for an intelligent adaptive ability which can react to environmental dynamics. Adaptive systems are more resistant to system and environmental changes potentially resulting in significant cost saving though increased operational life. The engineering of Mission Management systems for Multiple Intelligent Autonomous Vehicles(MIAVs) in particular and the management problem domain in general places heavy reliance on human decision making and supervision. Computerised management systems have been difficult to introduce primarily as a result of inadequacies in the technology. This is, in part, due to difficulties with describing models of the domain with sufficient precision. Experts in management have a good 'feel' for problems in the domain but, despite being effective managers, find it difficult to express their knowledge in anything but an approximate, vague, rule of thumb way. This conflicts with computer systems requirements which need a precise and complete description of domain relationships. Robotic computerised management solutions traditionally involve the Knowledge Based Planning(KBP) of activities over time and their monitoring during execution. This research extends KBP to approximate rule based systems to support initialisation from expert knowledge, while supporting adaption to fine tune approximate rule sets to better describe domain relationships. This approach takes advantage of expressible human expertise while compensating for inaccuracy, ignorance and incompleteness by supporting adaption, giving systems increased resistance to change and therefore greater longevity. Advantage is taken of recent developments in the use of approximate rule based models in the initialisation of adaptive control algorithms, specifically Neurofuzzy algorithms which can tune an approximate model to reflect arbitrary process relationships. Neurofuzzy Networks not only have the well understood adaptive advantages of Associative Memory Networks but also can be initialised with symbolic fuzzy linguistic rules improving their transparency, and thus aiding in system development and maintainability. This work has, in part, been based on research undertaken in the Advanced Systems Research Group (now the Image, Speech and Intelligent Systems Research Group) on an ESPRIT II project PANORAMA (Perception And Navigation fOR Autonomous Mobile Applications) which ended October 1993. The principle integration testbed was a Mercedes 4 -wheel-drive vehicle REMI, additional smaller laboratory based robots were used for local system integration and testing, whilst the developed final demonstration was performed on a <b>tracked</b> <b>drilling</b> machine, owned by TAMROCK (Finland).

40|$|BACKGROUND: A neuronavigation {{interface}} with extended function {{as compared with}} current systems was developed to aid during temporal bone surgery. The interface, named EVADE, updates the prior anatomical image and visualizes the bone drilling process virtually in real-time without need for intra-operative imaging. Furthermore, EVADE continuously calculates {{the distance from the}} drill tip to segmented temporal bone critical structures (e. g. the sigmoid sinus and facial nerve) and produces audiovisual warnings if the surgeon drills in too close vicinity. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the accuracy and surgical utility of EVADE in physical phantoms. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed 228 measurements assessing the position accuracy of <b>tracking</b> a navigated <b>drill</b> in the operating theatre. A mean target registration error of 1. 33 Â± 0. 61 mm with a maximum error of 3. 04 mm was found. Five neurosurgeons each drilled two temporal bone phantoms, once using EVADE, and once using a standard neuronavigation interface. While using standard neuronavigation the surgeons damaged three modeled temporal bone critical structures. No structure was hit by surgeons utilizing EVADE. Surgeons felt better orientated and thought they had improved tumor exposure with EVADE. Furthermore, we compared the distances between surface meshes of the virtual drill cavities created by EVADE to actual drill cavities: average maximum errors of 2. 54 Â± 0. 49 mm and - 2. 70 Â± 0. 48 mm were found. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results demonstrate that EVADE gives accurate feedback which reduces risks of harming modeled critical structures compared to a standard neuronavigation interface during temporal bone phantom drilling...|$|R
40|$|Directional Steering System (DSS) {{has been}} {{established}} for well drilling in the oilfield {{in order to accomplish}} high reservoir productivity and to improve accessibility of oil reservoirs in complex locations. In this thesis, dynamic modeling of two different DSS were developed and optimized using different control and optimization techniques. Firstly, the Rotary Steerable System (RSS) which is {{the current state of the}} art of directional steering systems. In this work, we address the problem of real time control of autonomous RSS with unknown formation friction and rock strength. The work presents an online control scheme for real time optimization of drilling parameters to maximize rate of penetration and minimize the deviation from the planned well bore trajectory, stick-slip oscillations, and bit wear. Nonlinear model for the drilling operation was developed using energy balance equation, where rock specific energy is used to calculate the minimum power required for a given rate of penetration. A proposed mass spring system was used to represent the phenomena of stick-slip oscillation. The bit wear is mathematically represented using Bourgoyne model. Secondly, the autonomous quad-rotor DSS which has 4 downhole motors, is considered. In this work, a novel feedback linearization controller to cancel the nonlinear dynamics of a DSS is proposed. The proposed controller design problem is formulated as an optimization problem for optimal settings of the controller feedback gains. Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) is developed to search for optimal settings of the proposed controller. The objective function considered is to minimize the <b>tracking</b> error and <b>drilling</b> efforts. Detailed mathematical formulation and computer simulation were used for evaluation of the performance of the proposed techniques for both systems, based on real well data...|$|R
