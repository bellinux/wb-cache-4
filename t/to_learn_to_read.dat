5|$|Asser recounts meeting Alfred {{first at}} the royal estate at Dean, Sussex (now East and West Dean, West Sussex). Asser {{provides}} only one datable event in his history: on St Martin's Day, 11 November 887, Alfred decided <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> Latin. Working backwards from this, it appears most likely that Asser was recruited by Alfred in early 885.|$|E
5|$|In public statements, Young {{claimed the}} {{alphabet}} {{was intended to}} replace the traditional Latin alphabet with an alternative, more phonetically accurate alphabet for the English language. This would offer immigrants an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write English, he said, the orthography of which is often less phonetically consistent than those of many other languages. Similar experiments have not been uncommon, the most well-known {{of which is the}} Shavian alphabet.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Santoso {{returned}} to Batavia {{and took a}} teaching job at the Muhammadiyah-run teacher's college there, refusing {{a position in the}} colonial government to do so. While teaching, she continued to be active in the nationalist movement, helping Adam Malik to establish the news agency Antara. On February 1938 she married R. Santoso Wirodihardjo. That same year, she led a congress dealing with marriage reform, to better protect the rights of women; the reforms passed in 1941. Santoso also worked to promote women's literacy through sewing groups; women who came to study sewing would be invited <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and about marriage rights and child-rearing.|$|E
50|$|Sudbury Valley School {{claims that}} all of their {{students}} have <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> While students <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> at {{a wide variety of}} ages, {{there appears to be no}} drawback <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> later: No one who meets their older students could guess the age at which they first <b>learned</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b>|$|R

50|$|The barrier <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> is {{the lack}} of {{textbooks}} and novels while the barrier <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> IML {{is the lack}} of technology access. Highlighting the value of IML helps to identify existing barriers within the school infrastructure, the staff development, and the support systems. While there is a continued need to work on the foundations to provide a sustainable and equitable access, the biggest obstacle will be school climate.|$|R
5|$|There are {{records of}} two tutors {{for the young}} duke during the late 1030s and early 1040s, but the extent of William's {{literary}} education is unclear. He was not known as a patron of authors, {{and there is little}} evidence that he sponsored scholarship or other intellectual activities. Orderic Vitalis records that William tried <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> Old English late in life, but he was unable to devote sufficient time to the effort and quickly gave up. William's main hobby appears to have been hunting. His marriage to Matilda appears to have been quite affectionate, and there are no signs that he was unfaithful to her– unusual in a medieval monarch. Medieval writers criticised William for his greed and cruelty, but his personal piety was universally praised by contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Reading is {{considered}} to be a key element of vocabulary development in school-age children. Before children are able to read on their own, children can learn from others reading to them. Learning vocabulary from these experiences includes using context, as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story. This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a visual reference or comparisons, usually to prior knowledge and past experiences. Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child's repetition of the new word back to the adult. When a child begins <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> their print vocabulary and oral vocabulary tend to be the same, as children use their vocabulary knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms. These two forms of vocabulary are usually equal up until grade 3. Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language, print vocabulary begins to expand beyond oral vocabulary. By age 10, children's vocabulary development through reading moves away from learning concrete words to learning abstract words.|$|E

50|$|Primer, or Cheap and Short Instruction in Reading and Writing, is a four-page {{introduction}} <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> It {{presents the}} first Lithuanian alphabet: 23 uppercase letters in Latin font and 26 lowercase letters in Gothic font. It also included exercises in constructing syllables, i.e. taking all consonants and systematically pairing them with all vowels. The primer ends with two tips.

I discuss teaching the novel to students, helping them build an understanding of its meaning from the bottom upwards, out of the detail of the text. Finally I discuss the novel's own preoccupation with a child's <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> perceive meaning and value in the life around he...|$|R
50|$|Sight words {{account for}} a large {{percentage}} (up to 75%) of the words used in beginning children's print materials. The advantage for children being able to recognize sight words automatically is that a beginning reader {{will be able to}} identify the majority of words in a beginning text before they even attempt <b>to</b> <b>read</b> it; therefore, allowing the child to concentrate on meaning and comprehension as they <b>read</b> without having <b>to</b> stop and decode every single word. Advocates of whole-word instruction believe that being able to recognize a large number of sight words gives students a better start <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b>|$|R

25|$|Because it {{was illegal}} in many states for slaves <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> or write, soul food recipes and cooking {{techniques}} tended to be passed along orally, until after emancipation. The first soul food cookbook is attributed to Abby Fisher, entitled What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking and published in 1881. Good Things to Eat was published in 1911; the author, Rufus Estes, was a former slave {{who worked for the}} Pullman railway car service. Many other cookbooks were written by Black Americans during that time, but as they were not widely distributed, most are now lost.|$|E
25|$|Education benefited too. It {{encouraged}} {{people to}} read, and indeed stimulated people <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> It also encouraged people to write, for example articles and letters. A gauge of literacy, or specifically {{the ability to}} sign one's name, is available from 1754 when both parties were required to sign marriage registers. By analysing five Cornish parishes indicates that approximately 24% of men and 70% of women could not sign their names between 1760 and 1770. However, by 1870 that figure had improved to 18% for men and 40% for women. Although it cannot be shown {{that this is a}} direct cause of the newspapers, there are writings (e.g. Andrew Brice writing in the Grand Gazetteer) to indicate that it was the considered opinion at the time.|$|E

If these skills are prerequisite skills, one should not find competent readers who lack them. (It is important to caution, however, that even if competent readers have certain skills, these skills are not necessarily prerequisite <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> competence. It is possible that competent readers acquired these skills after or as a concomitant <b>to</b> <b>learning</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|One of {{the first}} and {{principal}} objectives of the revolutionary regime was the adoption of a standard national writing system. Shortly after coming to power, Barre introduced the Somali language (Af Soomaali) as the official language of education, and selected the modified Latin script developed by the Somali linguist Shire Jama Ahmed as the nation's standard orthography. From then on, all education in government schools had to be conducted in Somali, and in 1972, all government employees were ordered <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write Somali within six months. The reason given for this was to decrease a growing rift between those who spoke the colonial languages, and those who did not, as many of the high ranking positions in the former government were given to people who spoke either Italian or English.|$|E
25|$|Traditional phonics {{instruction}} has marked benefits. Early reading {{often involves}} significant expansion of a child's mental lexicon, which includes {{all the words}} the child has been exposed to and their meanings. By focusing {{on the principle of}} linking specific sounds and characters, the child has the ability to recognize new words and derive meaning from them. Being able to adapt what they know about language to new words they experience is crucial to expanding their mental lexicon; this allows for productive reading that is the ability to read new words. It also produces higher achievement for beginning readers and the difference is the greatest for those at risk of failing <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> While some children are able to infer these rules on their own, some need explicit instructions on phonics rules. Overall, children who are directly taught phonics are better at reading, spelling and comprehension.|$|E
25|$|As it {{mentioned}} before, convents were {{an important}} place {{of education for}} women during this period, for the monasteries and nunneries encourage the skills of reading and writing, {{and some of these}} communities provided opportunities for women to contribute to scholarly research. An example is the German abbess Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179 A.D), a famous philosopher and botanists, known for her prolific writings include treatments of various scientific subjects, including medicine, botany and natural history (c.1151–58). Another famous German abbess was Hroswitha of Gandersheim (935–1000 A.D.) that also helped encourage women to be intellectual. However, with the growth in number and power of nunneries, the all-male clerical hierarchy was not welcomed toward it, and thus it stirred up conflict by having backlash against women's advancement. That impacted many religious orders closed on women and disbanded their nunneries, and overall excluding women from the ability <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write. With that, the world of science became closed off to women, limiting women's influence in science.|$|E
