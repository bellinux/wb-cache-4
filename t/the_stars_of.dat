5|$|Although Aries came to {{represent}} specifically the ram whose fleece became the Golden Fleece of Ancient Greek mythology, it has represented a ram since late Babylonian times. Before that, <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> Aries formed a farmhand. Different cultures have incorporated <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> Aries into different constellations including twin inspectors in China and a porpoise in the Marshall Islands. Aries {{is a relatively}} dim constellation, possessing only four bright stars: Hamal (Alpha Arietis, second magnitude), Sheratan (Beta Arietis, third magnitude), Mesarthim (Gamma Arietis, fourth magnitude), and 41 Arietis (also fourth magnitude). The few deep-sky objects within the constellation are quite faint and include several pairs of interacting galaxies. Several meteor showers appear to radiate from Aries, including the Daytime Arietids and the Epsilon Arietids.|$|E
5|$|Collisions {{occur when}} two galaxies pass {{directly}} through {{each other and}} have sufficient relative momentum not to merge. <b>The</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> interacting galaxies will usually not collide, but the gas and dust within the two forms will interact, sometimes triggering star formation. A collision can severely distort {{the shape of the}} galaxies, forming bars, rings or tail-like structures.|$|E

5|$|Scenes from Carry On... Up the Khyber were filmed on {{the lower}} part of the Watkin Path in 1968, with the Watkin Path {{representing}} the Khyber Pass in the film. In 2005 one of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> the film, Angela Douglas, unveiled a plaque at the precise location where filming took place, to commemorate the location filming, and it forms part of the North Wales Film and Television Trail, run by the Wales Screen Commission.|$|E
5|$|The {{first record}} of Auriga's stars was in Mesopotamia as a {{constellation}} called GAM, representing a scimitar or crook. However, {{this may have}} represented just Capella (Alpha Aurigae) or the modern constellation as a whole; this figure was alternatively called Gamlum or MUL.GAM in the MUL.APIN. The crook of Auriga stood for a goat-herd or shepherd. It was formed from most of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> the modern constellation; all of the bright stars were included except for Elnath, traditionally assigned to both Taurus and Auriga. Later, Bedouin astronomers created constellations that were groups of animals, where each star represented one animal. <b>The</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> Auriga comprised a herd of goats, an association also present in Greek mythology. The association with goats carried into the Greek astronomical tradition, though it later became associated with a charioteer along with the shepherd.|$|E

5|$|Although {{above the}} horizon and hence visible to the Ancient Greeks, Antlia's stars were too faint to have been {{included}} in any ancient constellations. The stars that now comprise Antlia lay within an area of the sky covered by the ancient constellation Argo Navis, the Ship of the Argonauts, which due to its immense size was split into several smaller constellations by Lacaille in 1763. Ridpath reports that due to their faintness, <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> Antlia did not make up part of the classical depiction of Argo Navis.|$|E
5|$|As all <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> a {{globular}} cluster are at {{approximately the same}} distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their visual magnitude by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the {{globular cluster}} will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E
5|$|At the 30 Rock studios, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan), <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> TGS, {{decide they}} want to help the sick crew. They think about getting the crew soup but are too lazy to do it; instead they decide that {{laughter}} is the best medicine. Jenna and Tracy, dressed as clowns, put on a very unsuccessful show at the TGS stage where they end up throwing a pie on Liz's face. The crew stands up for Liz until they see the red dot where she received the shot. She confesses that she chose the vacation over the crew, as she later was told by Cerie that the hotel had rooms available, which results in the crew hating her for it.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Jack, {{responding}} to audience research, starts cleaning out green {{clothes from the}} set. He asks Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), one of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> TGS, how old she is, and she tells him that she is 29. As {{a result of this}} exchange, Jenna gets botox and collagen injections that go terribly wrong. Later, during a sketch rehearsal—involving impersonations of Condoleezza Rice, Laura Bush, and John Kerry—the various mishaps of Tracy, Jenna, and Josh prompt Liz and Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) that it would be impossible for the three to perform on the show. Fortunately, the power in the NBC Studios goes out, canceling the show.|$|E
5|$|Cupid conceals himself, as Theseus and Ariadne {{arrive on}} the island a short {{distance}} away. Ariadne muses over her disloyalty to her father, but declares her love for Theseus. She departs to find shelter for the night, after which a fishermen's chorus compares her eyes with <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> heaven. Theseus, alone with his counsellor, discusses his abandonment of Ariadne, and is advised that this decision is justified, as {{she will not be}} acceptable to the people of Athens as their ruler's consort.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the lead}} of Hendrix in rock, psychedelia began to {{influence}} African American musicians, particularly <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> the Motown label. This psychedelic soul {{was influenced by the}} civil rights movement, giving it a darker and more political edge than much psychedelic rock. Building on the funk sound of James Brown, it was pioneered from about 1968 by Sly and the Family Stone and The Temptations. Acts that followed them into this territory included Edwin Starr and the Undisputed Truth. George Clinton's interdependent Funkadelic and Parliament ensembles and their various spin-offs took the genre to its most extreme lengths making funk almost a religion in the 1970s, producing over forty singles, including three in the US top ten, and three platinum albums.|$|E

5|$|For {{much of its}} existence, {{the studio}} was {{recognized}} as the premier American animation studio; it developed many of the techniques, concepts, and principles that became standard practices of traditional animation. The studio also pioneered the art of storyboarding, which is now a standard technique used in both animated and live-action filmmaking. The studio's catalog of animated features is among Disney's most notable assets, with <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> its animated shorts– Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, and Pluto– becoming recognizable figures in popular culture and mascots for The Walt Disney Company as a whole.|$|E
5|$|In August 2013, Cook {{began working}} on his new {{television}} series, Written N Black & White. He is listed as one of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> the show along with fellow comedian, Trina Jeffrie. The two play an interracial newlywed couple who are comedians and their parents are clueless of the marriage.

5|$|In Chinese astronomy, most of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> Serpens {{represented}} {{part of a}} wall {{surrounding a}} marketplace, known as Tianshi, which was in Ophiuchus and part of Hercules. Serpens also contains a few Chinese constellations. Two stars in the tail represented part of Shilou, the tower with the market office. Another star in the tail represented Liesi, jewel shops. One star in the head (Mu Serpentis) marked Tianru, the crown prince's wet nurse, or sometimes rain.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> <b>of</b> South Africa was {{expanded}} on 17 October 1978, when a non-military division with decorations in five classes was instituted, for conferment on civilians and, from 1988, on senior police, prisons service and intelligence service officers, {{as well as}} foreign military attachés. The senior of these five non-military decorations, <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> <b>of</b> South Africa, Grand Cross, ranks on par with <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> <b>of</b> South Africa, Gold.|$|R
25|$|The flag {{representing}} British India {{was usually}} the Union Jack with <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> <b>of</b> India. In many International events and International associations the Red Ensign with <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> <b>of</b> India {{was used to}} represent India.|$|R

5|$|In Chinese astronomy, <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> Corvus {{are located}} within the Vermilion Bird of the South (南方朱雀, Nán Fāng Zhū Què). The four main stars depict a chariot, Zhen, which is the 28th and final lunar mansion; Alpha and Eta mark the linchpins for the wheels, and Zeta is Changsha, a coffin. In Indian astronomy, the five main stars of Corvus {{represent}} a hand or fist corresponding to the Hastā, the 13th nakshatra or lunar mansion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fifth}} week, Florida crushed the {{mismatched}} Sewanee Tigers 71–6 in Jacksonville despite Sewanee's highly publicized aerial attack. Clyde Crabtree and Tommy Owens {{had to sit}} out with injuries. Goof Bowyer, Red Bethea, and Broward McClellan were seen as <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>of</b> the game. The Gators played substitutes throughout the second half, putting the first stringers back in {{by the middle of}} the fourth quarter. Florida's center, Frank Clark, also drew praise for his play on the line. This score placed the Gators in first place for scoring within the Southern Conference, and still remains one of the seven highest single-game scoring totals in Gators team history.|$|E
