Instead of buying market substitutes, they try {{to meet their needs}} without spending money by taking care of children instead of hiring help, taking care of the sick instead of taking them to the hospital, and making food from scratch instead of buying pre-made food. The way that poor families deal with the time debt is for the main caretaker to intensify the time that they spend working, by doing multiple jobs at once instead of doing one job at a time. When people increase the intensity of their work to compensate for their lack of time to finish everything that needs <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>done,</b> called work intensity, many health problems occur.|$|E

2500|$|... "Santa Maria" [...] {{was made}} {{approximately}} {{a year after}} Diorama, and was inspired by Yonezu's time spent by himself at home. The song and its B-side [...] "Hyakki Yak≈ç" [...] were the first time Yonezu worked with a band. He decided {{to work with a}} band for his major debut as he enjoyed a band sound, and was searching for musicians who had similar ideas as himself. He felt he would have difficulties finding these kinds of people outside of a major label, so took up an offer from Universal. Another reason he decided to work with band members was to get used to other people's opinions and nuances added to his music, something {{he did not have to}} do when making Vocaloid music, or when he worked on Diorama. Yonezu, while finding it difficult to express his opinions and ideas properly, also felt constricted by working by himself, as too much freedom caused little work <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>done.</b> He likened working with a band to being [...] "thrown into an unknown country." [...] "Santa Maria" [...] was written about his decision what to do musically, after a long period of being unsure how to progress after Diorama. He took the phrase [...] "Santa Maria" [...] for the song due to its associations with holiness and purity to illustrate this new-found direction.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Kelly Rowland {{teamed up}} with rapper Nelly to record the chorus and vocals on the track [...] "Dilemma" [...] for his album Nellyville. Released as the album's second single, the song {{became one of the}} most {{successful}} singles of the year, topping various charts worldwide, including the US Billboard Hot 100. Originally scheduled to be released in early 2003, the success of the collaboration caused the label to extend the release date of Rowland's debut solo album Simply Deep, which Rowland rushed within three weeks <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>done</b> and featured a mixture of Alternative R and rock music. Released in the United States in October 2002 and internationally in 2003, Simply Deep was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has sold 602,000 copies in the United States. Released to an even bigger success in international territories, the album topped the UK Albums Chart and became a gold-seller in Australia, Canada and New Zealand, resulting in worldwide sales total of two and a half million copies. The album yielded three singles. [...] "Stole", a rock pop-influenced mid-tempo track about loss, was released as the album's lead single and became an international top-ten hit single, peaking at number two in Australia and the United Kingdom. In the United States, the song failed to capitalize on the success of [...] "Dilemma", reaching the top-thirty only.|$|E

Taking place a year after a storm prompted {{the closure of the}} city's subway system in January2015, only to largely bypass the city, Governor Andrew Cuomo stated that services would remain running. Approximately 1,800workers equipped with 800heaters were to keep rails clear for use. Thousands of sanitation workers, 1,700plows, and 150,000tons of road salt were on standby to clear city roads. He also put 600members of the New York National Guard on standby. More than 50 power workers from Vermont were dispatched to Long Island to help restore power outages. Around noon on January23, owing to a significant increase in expected snowfall, Cuomo issued a travel ban for all roads in New York City and Long Island. The New York City Transit Authority suspended bus service; rail service on the Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North, and Staten Island Railway; and elevated subway service (with underground subway lines remaining open until further notice). In the meantime, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey closed bridges and tunnels in the region.|$|E

The Austrian minister replied several weeks after (June 30). If he had been invited, he said, officially to interfere he would have declined; as it was, he would bring Mr. Gladstone's statements to the notice of his Sicilian majesty. Meanwhile, at great length, he reminded Lord Aberdeen that a political offender may be the worst of all offenders, and argued that the rigour exercised by England herself in the Ionian Islands, in Ceylon, in respect of Irishmen, and in the recent case of Ernest Jones, showed how careful she should be in taking up abroad the cause of bad men posing as martyrs in the holy cause of liberty.|$|E

My name is Marian Halcombe; and I am as inaccurate as women usually are, in calling Mr. Fairlie my uncle, and Miss Fairlie my sister. My mother was twice married: the first time to Mr. Halcombe, my father; the second time to Mr. Fairlie, my half-sister's father. Except that we are both orphans, we are in every respect as unlike each other as possible. My father was a poor man, and Miss Fairlie's father was a rich man. I have got nothing, and she has a fortune. I am dark and ugly, and she is fair and pretty. Everybody thinks me crabbed and odd (with perfect justice); and everybody thinks her sweet-tempered and charming (with more justice still). In short, she is an angel; and I am---- Try some of that marmalade, Mr. Hartright, and finish the sentence, in the name of female propriety, for yourself. What am I to tell you about Mr. Fairlie? Upon my honour, I hardly know. He is sure to send for you after breakfast, and you can study him for yourself. In the meantime, I may inform you, first, that he is the late Mr. Fairlie's younger brother; secondly, that he is a single man; and thirdly, that he is Miss Fairlie's guardian. I won't live without her, and she can't live without me; and that is how I come to be at Limmeridge House. My sister and I are honestly fond of each other; which, you will say, is perfectly unaccountable, under the circumstances, and I quite agree with you--but so it is. You must please both of us, Mr. Hartright, or please neither of us: and, what is still more trying, you will be thrown entirely upon our society. Mrs. Vesey is an excellent person, who possesses all the cardinal virtues, and counts for nothing; and Mr. Fairlie is too great an invalid to be a companion for anybody. I don't know what is the matter with him, and the doctors don't know what is the matter with him, and he doesn't know himself what is the matter with him. We all say it's on the nerves, and we none of us know what we mean when we say it. However, I advise you to humour his little peculiarities, when you see him to-day. Admire his collection of coins, prints, and water-colour drawings, and you will win his heart. Upon my word, if you can be contented with a quiet country life, I don't see why you should not get on very well here. From breakfast to lunch, Mr. Fairlie's drawings will occupy you. After lunch, Miss Fairlie and I shoulder our sketch-books, and go out to misrepresent Nature, under your directions. Drawing is her favourite whim, mind, not mine. Women can't draw--their minds are too flighty, and their eyes are too inattentive. No matter--my sister likes it; so I waste paint and spoil paper, for her sake, as composedly as any woman in England. As for the evenings, I think we can help you through them. Miss Fairlie plays delightfully. For my own poor part, I don't know one note of music from the other; but I can match you at chess, backgammon, ecarte, and (with the inevitable female drawbacks) even at billiards as well. What {{do you think of the}} programme? Can you reconcile yourself to our quiet, regular life? or do you mean to be restless, and secretly thirst for change and adventure, in the humdrum atmosphere of Limmeridge House?" ...|$|E
