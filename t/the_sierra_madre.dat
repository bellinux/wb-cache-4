5|$|The {{littoral}} zone of Soconusco lies {{to the south}} of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> de Chiapas, and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre.</b> Although the entire coastal strip {{is often referred to as}} Soconusco, Soconusco proper is the southeastern portion characterised by a humid tropical climate and rich agricultural lands. The northwestern portion of the coastal strip featuring a drier climate was historically referred to as El Despoblado ("The Unpopulated"); it is generally referred to now as the Isthmus Coast Region (Spanish: Istmo-Costa).|$|E
5|$|The {{littoral}} zone of Soconusco lies {{to the south}} of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> de Chiapas, and consists of a narrow coastal plain and the foothills of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre.</b> The Maya highlands extend eastwards from Chiapas into Guatemala, reaching their highest in the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes. The major pre-Columbian population centres of the highlands were located in the largest highland valleys, such as the Valley of Guatemala and the Quetzaltenango Valley. In the southern highlands, a belt of volcanic cones runs parallel to the Pacific coast. The highlands extend northwards into Verapaz, and gradually descend to the east.|$|E

5|$|As {{the storm}} {{continued}} inland, it rapidly weakened and apparently dissipated over <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> Occidental.

5|$|Further {{strengthening}} {{was expected}} by forecasters, {{but did not}} come. The storm's motion slowed, and the center began wobbling erratically toward the coast. The storm made landfall around 11:00UTC on July20 near San Fernando in Tamaulipas. The storm had sustained winds of 125mph (200km/h), Category3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. After heading inland over northeast Mexico, it dissipated over <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> Oriental on July21.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Henriette then emerged {{over the}} Gulf of California, and made its second {{landfall}} near Guaymas, Sonora. After causing heavy rains in Sonora, the storm dissipated over <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> Occidental and its remnants {{went on to}} cause flooding in New Mexico and Texas. Damage totaled about $275million (2007MXN, $25million 2007USD).

5|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} Chiapas was the {{campaign}} {{undertaken by the}} Spanish conquistadores against the Late Postclassic Mesoamerican polities in the territory that is now incorporated into the modern Mexican state of Chiapas. The region is physically diverse, featuring a number of highland areas, including <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> de Chiapas and the Monta√±as Centrales (Central Highlands), a southern littoral plain known as Soconusco and a central depression formed by the drainage of the Grijalva River.|$|E

5|$|The best decade for January movies, Burr writes, {{may well}} have been the 1940s. It began with what he {{suggests}} was best January in cinema history. The Grapes of Wrath, His Girl Friday and The Shop Around the Corner, all considered classics, were released in January 1940. Later in the decade, other classic films would first reach screens during January, such as Sullivan's Travels, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Screen Writers Guild {{set up on}} December 8, 1941, the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, a body to {{organize}} writers for the war effort. Rossen served as the body's chairman until 1944 and advocated {{the opening of a}} Second Front to support West European resistance against the Nazis. His earnings were much greater than in 1937. However, his work for Hollywood Writers Mobilization and for the Communist Party forced him to abandon some partly developed film projects, including The Treasure of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre,</b> which John Huston eventually directed in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Farther inland, Arlene {{turned to}} the west-southwest along the {{building}} ridge. The storm decreased in strength upon doing so; its mid- and low-level circulations became increasingly decoupled, with the latter turning elongated and ill-defined. Early on July1, the NHC downgraded Arlene to a tropical depression, and the cyclone dissipated over the high terrain of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> Mountains shortly thereafter. Arlene's remnants continued to produce heavy precipitation over central Mexico, and with high air pressures offshore a tight pressure gradient generated a strong easterly breeze along the country's Pacific coastlines.|$|E

5|$|A weak trough {{existed in}} the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September29. A {{circulation}} developed within the storm, becoming a tropical depression on October1. Later that day, the system intensified into Tropical Storm How. Initially, the tropical storm moved west-northwestward and its sustained winds peaked by October2, estimated at 45mph (75km/h). Officials advised small boats to remain at port along the Louisiana coast due to the storm. On October3, Tropical Storm How turned toward the southwest as it began weakening, {{and the next day}} it moved ashore near La Pesca, Tamaulipas as a tropical depression. About six hours after making landfall, How dissipated over <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> Oriental in northeastern Mexico. How was the only named storm in the season not to attain hurricane status.|$|E

In Dead Money, the Courier is captured by an insane ex-Brotherhood of Steel leader known as Father Elijah and must work alongside three other captives {{to find the}} fabled treasure of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> Casino, concealed from the world by a deadly toxic cloud. The pack adds new achievements/trophies, new weapons, perks, terrain, enemies and decisions for the player, as well as raising the level cap by five.

5|$|Later on October23, rapid {{weakening}} ensued as an eyewall replacement cycle {{took shape}} and wind shear increased. In the five hours up until landfall in Mexico, Patricia weakened at an unprecedented rate while still over water. However, it remained a violent hurricane and moved ashore around 23:00UTC near Cuixmala, Jalisco, with winds of 150mph (240km/h) and an analyzed pressure of 932mbar (hPa; 27.49inHg). This {{made it the}} most intense Pacific hurricane on record to strike Mexico. Once onshore, the high terrain of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> mountains accelerated Patricia's weakening. The low- and mid-level circulations of the tropical cyclone decoupled, with the latter accelerating northeast, and Patricia dissipated on October24 over central Mexico, less than 18hours after moving ashore.|$|E

5|$|Quickly after peaking, {{wind shear}} from the {{approaching}} trough weakened the hurricane, and by six hours after reaching peak intensity, the winds in Hurricane Kenna dropped to 150mph (240km/h) after the eye nearly dissipated. Despite a 27mbar {{increase in pressure}} in 12hours, convective activity increased prior to Kenna making landfall. On October 25 Hurricane Kenna struck near San Blas {{in the state of}} Nayarit with estimated winds of 140mph (225km/h). The hurricane rapidly weakened over the mountainous terrain of western Mexico, and the circulation dissipated on October 26 over <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> Occidental mountains. The remnants continued northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico and southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|The Maya civilization was a Mesoamerican civilization {{developed}} by the Maya peoples, and noted for its hieroglyphic script‚Äîthe only known fully developed writing system of the pre-Columbian Americas‚Äîas well as for its art, architecture, mathematics, calendar, and astronomical system. The Maya civilization developed {{in an area that}} encompasses southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador. This region consists of the northern lowlands encompassing the Yucat√°n Peninsula, and the highlands of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre,</b> running from the Mexican state of Chiapas, across southern Guatemala and onwards into El Salvador, and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain.|$|E
5|$|The dump months {{evolved over}} the course of the 20th century. Although during the studio era most major {{releases}} followed annual patterns similar to today's, several classics like The Kid, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of <b>the</b> <b>Sierra</b> <b>Madre</b> were released during January. Since the decline of the studios, however, memorable films from the dump months have become rare exceptions. The most notable is The Silence of the Lambs, a well-reviewed box office smash released in late January 1991 that went on to win that year's Academy Award for Best Picture. Several years before that, Dirty Dancing and Fatal Attraction became hits following releases in August and September respectively.|$|E
