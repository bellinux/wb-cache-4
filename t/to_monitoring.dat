5000|$|Combination with static analysis. A common {{combination}} of static and dynamic analyses, particularly encountered in compilers, is <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> all the requirements which cannot be discharged statically. A dual and ultimately equivalent approach tends {{to become the}} norm in runtime verification, namely to use static analysis {{to reduce the amount}} of otherwise exhaustive monitoring. Static analysis can be performed both on the property <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> and on the system <b>to</b> be <b>monitored.</b> Static analysis of the property <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> can reveal that certain events are unnecessary <b>to</b> <b>monitor,</b> that the creation of certain monitors can be delayed, and that certain existing monitors will never trigger and thus can be garbage collected. Static analysis of the system <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> can detect code that can never influence the monitors. For example, when monitoring the HasNext property above, one needs not instrument portions of code where each call i.next (...) is immediately preceded on any path by a call i.hasnext (...) which returns true (visible on the control-flow graph).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Engine {{fuel flow}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} parameters of aero-engine performance, which can accurately reflect the actual condition of aero-engine. It'is possible <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the aero-engine fuel flow (FF) by reading the data of QAR (Quick Access Recorder). However, it's difficult <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the actual condition of aero-engine through the traditional method because of the vast amount of QAR data and the complexity of the engine itself. Feed forward process neural network is adopted <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the QAR-based aero-engine fuel flow.

The {{members of the}} Garde were mostly former army {{soldiers}} from the provinces, with little attachment to Paris. They were headquartered in the quarter Saint-Martin, and were more efficient and reliable supporters of the royal government, responsible for putting down riots in 1709 and 1725. In 1771 the Guet was formally placed under the command of the Garde, and was gradually integrated into its organization. The responsibilities of the Garde were far-ranging, from chasing criminals <b>to</b> <b>monitoring</b> bread prices, keeping traffic moving on the streets, settling disputes and maintaining public order.|$|E
25|$|Tandem mass {{spectrometry}} enables {{a variety of}} experimental sequences. Many commercial mass spectrometers are designed to expedite the execution of such routine sequences as selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and precursor ion scanning. In SRM, the first analyzer allows only a single mass through and the second analyzer monitors for multiple user-defined fragment ions. SRM is most often used with scanning instruments where the second mass analysis event is duty cycle limited. These experiments are used to increase specificity of detection of known molecules, notably in pharmacokinetic studies. Precursor ion scanning refers <b>to</b> <b>monitoring</b> for a specific loss from the precursor ion. The first and second mass analyzers scan across the spectrum as partitioned by a user-defined m/z value. This experiment is used to detect specific motifs within unknown molecules.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{problems}} associated with water-logged and wet soils, it is important for viticulturist to know how much water is currently in the soil before deciding if and how much to irrigate. There are several methods of evaluating soil moisture. The most basic is simple observation and feeling of the soil, however this has its limitations since the subsoil may be moist while the surface soil appears dry. More specific measurements can be attained by using tensiometers which evaluates surface tension of water extracted from the soil. The presence of water in the soil can be measured by neutron moisture meters that utilize an aluminium tube with an internal neutron source that detect the subtle change between the water in the soil. Similarly, gypsum block placed throughout the vineyard contain an electrode {{that can be used to}} detect the electrical resistance that occurs as the soil dries and water is released by evaporation. Since the 1990s there has been greater research into tools utilizing time-domain reflectometry and capacitance probes. In addition <b>to</b> <b>monitoring</b> for excessive moisture, viticulturists also keep an eye for signs of water stress (discussed below) due to severe lack of water.|$|E

25|$|Originally, CRREL cold-room {{facilities}} used trichloroethylene (TCE) as a refrigerant. At {{the time there}} were few known environmental hazards attributed to TCE. Subsequently, TCE {{has been identified as}} a carcinogen. In 1970, an industrial accident resulted in a spill of approximately 3,000 gallons of TCE. In 1978, TCE was introduced into the ground via an experimental well. After the 1990 discovery of TCE in groundwater, CRREL embarked on a remediation plan, approved by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES), with assistance from the U.S. Army Toxic and Hazardous Materials Agency and the Corps of Engineers New England Division. NHDES reports that CRREL no longer stores TCE on site and the remediation of TCE in the groundwater is subject <b>to</b> <b>monitoring</b> in test wells. According to an Army press release cited in the local newspaper, the Army expanded monitoring of TCE at other locations on the CRREL campus and found some elevated readings in 2011. Thereafter, they initiated a monitoring well and soil sampling program to map the concentrations of the substance on the site. The information gained should lead to a new cleanup strategy for the site, according to the 2012 report. Army environmental specialists have detected TCE at neighboring residential and school properties.|$|E

40|$|Among {{the factors}} {{providing}} incentives <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the behaviour of input suppliers are the regulatory requirements to which downstream firms are subject. We develop a formal economic model {{to examine the}} relationship between the strictness of the regulatory environment and downstream firms’ incentives to act as inspectors of their sub-contractors. We consider the interaction between a downstream producer and an upstream input supplier. The downstream chooses the probability with which <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the upstream’s compliance and the upstream chooses a compliance level which determines compliance of the end product with quality or environmental regulation. We find that the strictness of regulation affects the downstream’s monitoring strategy in combination with the level of quality or environmental standards. If the standards are sufficiently low then the strictness of regulation increases incentives <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the upstream. Contrary, if the standards are sufficiently high then the pressure on the downstream <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> the upstream is relaxed and the strictness of regulation decreases incentives <b>to</b> <b>monitor.</b> We argue that the strictness of regulation should not be treated in isolation as a factor determining the choice of downstream firms <b>to</b> <b>monitor</b> their input suppliers. compliance; monitoring; supply chain; quality and environmental regulation...|$|R
