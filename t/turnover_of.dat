40|$|Southeast Asia has {{undergone}} a significant political transformation {{over the past two}} decades. Until 1986, not a single Southeast Asian state could be classified as genuinely democratic. Today, Indonesia is the world's third largest democracy, East Timor has emerged as Asia's newest democratic state, and the Philippines and Thailand remain nominal, if deeply troubled, democracies, Thailand having returned to unstable civilian rule following the 2006 coup, while defective democracy continues in the Philippines. All of these Southeast Asian countries also meet Huntington's 'two-turnover test' of democratic development (Huntington, 1991, 1 further page (266 - 7)) - that is, they have experienced at least two peaceful <b>turnovers</b> <b>of</b> power via the electoral process.
