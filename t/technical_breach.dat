40|$|This report {{looks at}} the results and {{recommendations}} of a project exploring youth recidivismâin particular, {{whether it would be}} possible to analyse youth recidivism using data from the Juvenile Justice National Minimum Data Set (JJ NMDS). The JJ NMDS is a longitudinal person-based data collection, containing information on all children and young people in Australia supervised by youth justice agencies, both in the community and in detention. This report uses the 12 principles developed by Richards (2011) to analyse recidivism. It is important to note that as the JJ NMDS only contains data on supervised orders, any results derived from the JJ NDMS relate to 2 Ì 7 returns to sentenced supervision 2 Ì 7 rather than a broader measure of recidivism relating to any reversion to criminal behaviour. Benefits to using the JJ NMDS There are a number of benefits to using a longitudinal data collection such as the JJ NMDS to analyse 2 Ì 7 returns to supervision 2 Ì 7 rather than creating a separate collection containing aggregate data supplied by individual states and territories. These benefits include: enabling a young person 2 Ì 7 s recidivism across state and territory boundaries to be tracedallowing flexibility in reporting recidivism over a number of different timeframes (including over the young person 2 Ì 7 s youth justice career) making it possible to explore the impact of a range of variables on the levels of recidivism (e. g. demographics, age at first supervision, previous supervised orders) longer-term benefits such as potential linkage with other relevant data collections. Possible future development In its current form, the JJ NMDS can be used to fulfil a number of the 12 principles to measure recidivism, although there are some limitations. Many of these limitations would be resolved if offence data were included in the JJ NMDS, as this information would allow for: using offence dates rather than supervision datesmeasuring frequency and severity of reoffendingexcluding pseudo-recidivism, minor offences, <b>technical</b> <b>breaches</b> and restorations of suspended sentences.

It was originally intended to ensure that lay persons would not be deterred from acting as trustees, since the court could exercise its discretion under section 61 to relieve them from liability if they acted honestly and reasonably.

40|$|Games {{of timing}} aim to {{determine}} the optimal defense against a strategic attacker who has the <b>technical</b> capability to <b>breach</b> a system in a stealthy fashion. Key questions arising are when the attack takes place, and when a defensive move should be initiated to reset the system resource to a known safe state. In our work, we study a more complex scenario called Time-Based Security in which we combine three main notions: protection time, detection time, and reaction time. Protection time represents {{the amount of time}} the attacker needs to execute the attack successfully. In other words, protection time represents the inherent resilience of the system against an attack. Detection time is the required time for the defender to detect that the system is compromised. Reaction time is the required time for the defender to reset the defense mechanisms in order to recreate a safe system state. In {{the first part of the}} paper, we study the VERIS Community Database (VCDB) and screen other data sources to provide insights into the actual timing of security incidents and responses. While we are able to derive distributions for some of the factors regarding the timing of security breaches, we assess the state-of-the-art regarding the collection of timing-related data as insufficient. In the second part of the paper, we propose a two-player game which captures the outlined Time-Based Security scenario in which both players move according to a periodic strategy. We carefully develop the resulting payoff functions, and provide theorems and numerical results to help the defender to calculate the best time to reset the defense mechanism by considering protection time, detection time, and reaction time.

40|$|Floods cause, even {{in modern}} {{countries}}, {{a lot of}} victims and damage every year. Generally, countries invest in prevention and protection, yet, also emergency response measures could be a (last) option. Regarding the latter, a distinction is made between preventive emergency measures (e. g. sand bags to raise the crest level of a flood defence) and curative emergency measures (e. g. measures to combat a breach in a flood defence). It can be stated that the knowledge about the closure of a dike breach and the implementation of emergency measures is not at the desired level. Besides, closing a breach is very difficult and it is rarely performed successfully. There {{is a need for}} research regarding emergency closure of dike breaches indicated by among others Dutch Water Boards. The problems of a dike breach can broadly be categorized in three fields: organizational problems, logistical problems and technical problems. This thesis focusses mainly on the <b>technical</b> problems, distinguishing <b>breach</b> characteristics and type of emergency measures. Therefore, in this thesis the research question is: What is the effectiveness and applicability of curative emergency measures, applied in developing breaches in a Dutch river or lake dike? To get {{a better understanding of the}} effect of emergency measures, simulations of developing breaches including emergency measures can be made with a numerical model. Simulations have several advantages. It allows identification of breach characteristics like duration and breach stages during closure attempts. Furthermore, it can be used to optimize closure strategies and measures and it can help flood managers to prepare for emergency situations. However, such a model is non-existent. Yet, XBeach is capable of simulating emergency measures as so-called non-erodible layers in developing breaches. With some modifications XBeach seems promising for simulating breach development with emergency measures. The modifications are based on XBeachâs limitations. First, emergency measures are implemented as non-erodible layers, these are however not adjustable in time. Running multiple simulations after each other representing the different closure phases, solves this problem. Second, the non-erodible layer is always stable. This means that the emergency measure can not move due to high flow velocities or scour during the simulation. This is the main limitation of XBeach for this research. To still be able to check the stability, separate calculations are done. Third, XBeach is not a 3 D model. Therefore, emergency measures where a 3 D effect (piping) plays an important role are not modelled. Fourth, XBeach is only capable of simulations with non-cohesive sand. To deal with this, a scaling from non-cohesive to cohesive timespans was made. For a breach closure in a sand dike, there is (likely too) little time. To estimate the time available in cohesive dikes, the timing is scaled to realistic proportions. Various curative measures exist. Simulated measures in this study in XBeach are a scaffold, Big Bags, a vessel and an emergency dike. The emergency dike seems to be the most promising measure. It makes use of the smaller flow velocities upstream of the breach. The breach dimensions stay smaller and the polder water level is lower. Point of attention is the static stability after the closure, with piping as the most important threat. Logistically seen, a complete closure with an emergency dike for a breach in a clay dike is plausible, using trucks to bring in Big Bags and helicopters to place them at the desired location. Next to these simulations, case studies of performed closures are evaluated, a field test is carried out and recommendations to set up a Decision Support System are done.
