5000|$|On November 1, 1950, Radio Kiev was {{formally}} introduced and transmitted its first broadcasts in the Ukrainian language only. These broadcasts {{were intended to}} reach the Ukrainian diaspora via shortwave radio, with frequencies in the 31, 25, and 19 meter shortwave bands using high power amplitude modulated (A-M) transmitters with omni-directional antennas. In October 1962 Radio Kiev introduced its first English language program broadcast schedule with daily transmissions on various shortwave frequencies. These transmissions originated from multiple <b>transmitting</b> <b>sites</b> employing high power Russian made (KOM) transmitters and gain type [...] "steerable" [...] antenna systems capable of the precision directing of radio broadcasts to desired regions worldwide.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the radio frequency design and test data for an experimental terrestrial air link, which simulates a satellite-to-ground communications link operating in a dual-polarization frequency-reuse mode in the 17. 7 -to- 21. 2 -GHz band. The terrestrial air link comprises a <b>transmit</b> <b>site</b> located on Mount Pack Monadnock in Temple, New Hampshire, and a receive site 42. 2 km away in Westford, Massachusetts. The <b>transmit</b> <b>site</b> uses a 1. 8 -m-diameter dish, and the receive site uses an 18. 3 -m-diameter dish enclosed by a 28. 4 -m-diameter air-supported radome. The terrestrial air link provides a test bed for evaluating atmospheric effects of fading and scintillation, along with amplitude, phase, and polarization distortion that can compromise the performance of satellite-to-ground communications systems. The test data indicate that the terrestrial air link has {{a high degree of}} cross-polarization isolation under clear-air conditions and is well suited for evaluating dualpolarization frequency-reuse techniques.
