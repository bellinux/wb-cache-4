5|$|By March 1905, Potter {{was anxious}} to begin work on the tale. She thought the 1903 version too thin and rewrote the entire story, {{retaining}} Ribby <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> <b>and</b> Duchess the dog as the central characters while elaborating the setting and developing a stronger plot line. It was decided the tale would be published in a format slightly larger than her previous productions with ten full-colour illustrations and other illustrations in pen and sepia ink.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{score was}} {{composed}} by Ed Bogas and Ray Shanklin. The soundtrack {{was released by}} Fantasy Records and Ampex Tapes in 1973.

5|$|The villain Charles Wilder {{was played}} by Forrest Stanley, {{an actor who}} had been cast in films such as Bavu (1923), Through the Dark (1924) and Shadow of the Law (1926). After his {{performance}} in <b>The</b> <b>Cat</b> <b>and</b> the Canary, Stanley played lesser roles in films such as Show Boat (1936) and Curse of the Undead (1959) and the television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Studio 57, and Gunsmoke.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, New York {{animator}} Ralph Bakshi {{came across}} a copy of R. Crumb's Fritz <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> <b>and</b> suggested to producer Steve Krantz that it would work as a film. After meeting with Bakshi, Crumb loaned him one of his sketchbooks as a reference, but was unsure of the film's production and refused to sign the contract. Bakshi and Crumb were unable {{to reach an agreement}} after two weeks of negotiations but Krantz secured the film rights from Crumb's wife, Dana, who had a power of attorney. Crumb received $50,000, distributed over the course of production and ten percent of Krantz's proceeds.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cat</b> <b>and</b> the Canary {{has been}} filmed five other times. Rupert Julian's The Cat Creeps (1930) and the Spanish {{language}} La Voluntad del muerto (The Will of the Dead Man) directed by George Melford and Enrique Tovar Ávalos {{were the first}} talkie versions of the play; they were produced and distributed by Universal Pictures in 1930. Although the first sound films produced by Universal, neither was as influential on the genre as the first film and The Cat Creeps is lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{penalty of}} the sack, {{with the animals}} included, {{experienced}} a revival in parts of late medieval, and early modern Germany (particularly in Saxony). The 14th century commentator on the 13th century compilation of laws/customs Sachsenspiegel, Johann von Buch, for example, states that the poena cullei is the appropriate punishment for parricides. Some differences evolved within the German ritual, relative to the original Roman ritual, though. Apparently, the rooster was not included, and the serpent might be replaced with {{a painting of a}} serpent {{on a piece of paper}} and the monkey could be replaced with a cat. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> <b>and</b> the dog were sometimes physically separated from the person, and the sack itself (with its two partitions) was made of linen, rather than of leather.|$|E
5|$|This one I had {{the most}} amount of input. I oversaw everything—the {{building}} of the sets, everyone's costumes, I had meetings with make-up and hair and the cinematographer, everybody. Casting, finding the right cat—just every aspect. Kind of like making a little movie. We basically sat down and just threw out all every idea we could possibly conceive of {{and of all the}} things we wanted. All the imagery we wanted—and I had a few set ideas, for instance <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> <b>and</b> the idea of Metropolis. I definitely wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E

25|$|The wildcat's closest living {{relatives}} are <b>the</b> sand <b>cat,</b> <b>the</b> Chinese mountain <b>cat</b> (which {{may be a}} subspecies of wildcat), <b>the</b> jungle <b>cat</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> black-footed <b>cat.</b> As a whole, the wildcat (along with <b>the</b> jungle <b>and</b> leopard <b>cat)</b> represents a much less specialised form than <b>the</b> sand <b>cat</b> <b>and</b> manul. However, wildcat subspecies of the lybica group do exhibit some further specialisation, namely {{in the structure of}} the auditory bullae, which bears similarity to those of <b>the</b> sand <b>cat</b> <b>and</b> manul.|$|R
5|$|A {{different}} {{version of}} this tale narrates that when the youngest daughter-in-law was pregnant, she secretly ate the food-offerings ritually dedicated to Shashthi and then blamed the theft on the black cat. Angered by the dishonour of its mistress and the unjust accusation of theft, the cat pledged to teach the young mother a lesson. In {{this version of the}} tale, the cat not only stole her six children, but also ate them. But when the seventh child was born, the mother caught the cat fleeing with her child and followed it but tripped in middle of the chase and fainted. The cat took the infant to Shashthi's abode, where she told the goddess the whole tale of her insult. The benign goddess, however, was annoyed with <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> <b>and</b> rushed to the aid of the mother. The goddess explained the reason of her suffering, and after the mother had begged the cat for forgiveness and had sworn to worship Shashthi on anointed days, all seven of her children were returned to her.|$|E
5|$|In 1984 he was {{nominated}} for an Olivier Award and was joint Best Newcomer in the Plays and Players Awards for his performance as Lennie in Of Mice and Men. Following {{the success of the}} play, it was transferred from the Nuffield Theatre in Southampton to the Mermaid Theatre in London. He went on to tour extensively as Lennie in Of Mice and Men, and has appeared in 6 different productions of the play. He also played Little John in the theatrical production of Robin Hood at the Young Vic Theatre; and Mitch in Tim Albery's production of A Streetcar Named Desire at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. Other theatrical credits include The Relapse; The Red Devil Battery Sign; King John; Johnny Johnson; The Ideal Gnome Expedition; East; Blood on the Neck of <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> <b>and</b> Bedroom Farce. He has also appeared as the guest star at the Wyndham's Theatre and Theatre Royal Bath, in the award-winning production of The Play What I Wrote.|$|E
5|$|Pankhurst {{was spared}} further {{force-feeding}} attempts after this incident, but {{she continued to}} violate the law and – when imprisoned – starve herself in protest. During the following two years she was arrested numerous times but was frequently released after several days because of her ill-health. Later, the Asquith government enacted <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> <b>and</b> Mouse Act, which allowed similar releases for other suffragettes facing ill-health due to hunger strikes. Prison officials recognised the potential public relations disaster that would erupt if the popular WSPU leader were force-fed or allowed to suffer extensively in jail. Still, police officers arrested her during talks and as she marched. She tried to evade police harassment by wearing disguises and eventually the WSPU established a jujutsu-trained female bodyguard squad to physically protect her against the police. She and other escorts were targeted by police, resulting in violent scuffles as officers tried to detain Pankhurst.|$|E

5|$|The {{first round}} is an {{elimination}} {{game in which}} the eight cats are {{placed in front of}} a bowl of cat food. The three cats which have eaten the most food when time expires move on to the second round; those who are eliminated earn $1,000. The three remaining owners answer trivia questions for points. The format is similar to Jeopardy! with six cat-related CATegories containing questions ranging from 10 to 50 points. The lowest-scoring owner is eliminated with $10,000. The two remaining cats are each then recorded in seven different situations. The owners wager points on what their cat will do before each clip is shown. They may not wager more than half of their points on the first two questions. For the remainder, they may wager any or all of their points. <b>The</b> <b>cat</b> <b>and</b> owner with the highest score win $25,000, and a chance to play the bonus round; the eliminated contestant earns $15,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{main roads}} through the Peak District are the A57 (Snake Pass) between Sheffield and Manchester, the A628 (Woodhead Pass) between Barnsley and Manchester via Longdendale, the A6 from Derby to Manchester via Buxton, <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> <b>and</b> Fiddle road from Macclesfield to Buxton, {{and in the}} extreme north of the Park the A635 (Saddleworth Moor) running from Manchester to Barnsley and the A62 from Manchester to Leeds, which forms the northernmost border of the National Park at Standedge. These major roads, {{together}} with other minor roads and lanes in the area, are attractive to drivers, but the Peak's popularity makes road congestion {{and the availability of}} parking spaces a significant problem, especially during summer. This led to the proposal of a congestion charge in 2005, but this was later rejected.|$|E
5|$|While Annabelle sleeps, {{the same}} mysterious hand {{emerges from the}} wall behind her bed and snatches the {{diamonds}} from her neck. Once again, her sanity is questioned, but as Harry and Annabelle search the room, they discover a hidden passage in the wall and in it the corpse of Roger Crosby. Mammy Pleasant leaves to call the police, while Harry searches for the guard; Susan runs away in hysterics and hitches a ride with a milkman (Joe Murphy). Paul and Annabelle return to her room {{to search for the}} missing envelope, and discover that Crosby's body is missing. Paul vanishes as the secret passage closes behind him. Wandering in the hidden passages, Paul is attacked by <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> <b>and</b> left for dead. He regains consciousness in time to rescue Annabelle. The police arrive and arrest the Cat, who is Charlie Wilder in disguise; the guard is his accomplice. Wilder is the person named in the second will; he hoped to drive Annabelle insane so that he could receive the inheritance.|$|E
