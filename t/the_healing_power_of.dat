5|$|Lyfjaberg {{is where}} the goddess sits {{surrounded}} by her helpful spirits. Although healing by a goddess—or indeed by a god either—has left little mark on Norse myths as they have come down to us, {{there is no doubt}} that <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> goddesses was of enormous importance in daily life in the pre-Christian period, as was that of many women saints in Christian times. The goddess who presided over childbirth was held to possess power over life and death, and was revered as a lifegiver, both in the family home and in the courts of kings, though she might also pass sentence of death.|$|E
5|$|The {{kings and}} queens regnant of England and the kings of France were the only Christian rulers who claimed the divine gift (divinitus) to cure by {{touching}} or stroking the diseased. This special aptitude {{was thought to be}} evidence of God's high esteem of the two monarchies, though they never agreed upon whose predecessors the ability was first conferred. In England, Saint Edward the Confessor (r. 1042–1066) was said to be the first monarch to possess <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the royal touch. The French, who normally traced the origins of their monarchs' divine gift back to Philip I (r. 1059–1108) or even Robert II (r. 987–1031), denied that Saint Edward used the royal touch. They insisted that the first English monarch to claim the ability was Henry I (r. 1100–1135), and that his touching was a politically influenced imitation of the gift granted exclusively to French monarchs.|$|E

It expresses the {{intimate}} closeness the 4th-century Christian felt with the Devil in all his disguises, and has many accounts of miracles. Some follow familiar conventions— casting out devils, raising the paralytic and the dead. Others are more unusual: turning back the flames from a house while Martin was burning down the Roman temple it adjoined; deflecting {{the path of a}} felled sacred pine; <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> a letter written from Martin.|$|E
25|$|The rich, gilded {{ornaments}} of the iconostasis are Jankovits' real style-marks. He {{worked with}} lime wood, and carved his decorative elements in two artistic styles: Zopf style appears in vivid plant motifs; and Classicism {{is represented by}} geometrical patterns, like the ribbons on pilasters or the carved tassels on the doors. The foliage usually has additional significance in ecclesiastical art. Acanthus leaves, the most common motifs on the iconostasis, symbolize heaven and the eternal life. Olive {{plays an important role}} in Biblical stories and it has many religious aspects too. There are two large olive branches under the Calvary scene, on the top of the icon screen. It represents peace in the first place, but in the Old Testament it stands for blessing, wisdom, trust, faith in God, and grace of God too, in the story of Noah. The olive is the tree of life in Paradise, and it also refers to <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the Blessed Virgin Mary, especially in Eastern rites where Mary's veneration plays an important role. Grape motifs decorate the icon frames and the holy doors. The Bible contains many examples of the symbolical meaning of vines and grapes. They can symbolize peace and well-being, and might refer to Israel, but in most cases the vine is a symbol of Jesus, its fruits representing the Apostles. Following the same symbolism, the vine can also refer to Mary, whose fruit is Jesus. The most common flower of the carved festoons is the rose, which is the symbol of Mary in Christian art. Tulips, the flower of the virginity and purity, appear in the festoons as well beside the rose heads.|$|E

2500|$|Cyril's {{writings}} {{are filled}} with the loving and forgiving nature of God which was somewhat uncommon during his time period. Cyril fills his writings with great lines of <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> forgiveness and the Holy Spirit, like “The Spirit comes gently and makes himself known by his fragrance. He is not felt as a burden for God is light, very light. Rays of light and knowledge stream before him as the Spirit approaches. The Spirit comes with the tenderness of a true friend to save, to heal, to teach, to counsel, to strengthen and to console”. [...] Cyril himself followed God's message of forgiveness many times throughout his life. This is most clearly seen in his two major exiles where Cyril was disgraced and forced to leave his position and his people behind. He never wrote or showed any ill will towards those who wronged him. Cyril stressed the themes of healing and regeneration in his catechesis.|$|E

2500|$|The opening track, [...] "Bright Side of the Road" [...] was a {{successful}} single in the UK, charting at #63. <b>The</b> <b>healing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> music would be subtly introduced on [...] "And the Healing Has Begun" [...] and would be a continuing theme in Morrison's music. [...] Although a celebration of love and life was the predominant theme of the album: [...] "Troubadours", [...] "Steppin' Out Queen" [...] and [...] "You Make Me Feel So Free" [...] were especially so. [...] "Troubadours" [...] is an uplifting celebration of the singer-songwriter from ancient days walking through towns [...] "singin songs of [...] love and chivalry". [...] "Rolling Hills" [...] is a joyful song in which the singer [...] directly refers to Christianity and of living his life [...] "in Him" [...] and reading The Bible.

2500|$|Robertson's {{service as}} a {{minister}} has included the belief in <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> God. He has cautioned believers that some Protestant denominations may harbor {{the spirit of the}} Antichrist; prayed to deflect hurricanes; denounced Hinduism as [...] "demonic" [...] and Islam as [...] "Satanic". Robertson has denounced left-wing views of feminism, activism regarding homosexuality, abortion, and liberal college professors. Critics claim Robertson had business dealings in Africa with former presidents Charles Taylor of Liberia and Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire who both had been internationally denounced for claims of human rights violations. Robertson was criticized worldwide for his call for Hugo Chávez’s assassination and for his remarks concerning Ariel Sharon's ill-health as an act of God. Robertson made American national news in October 2003 for interviews with author Joel Mowbray about his book Dangerous Diplomacy, a book critical of the United States Department of State. Robertson's commentary implied that if a small nuclear device were to be found at the State Department, such a thing might wake up America's leaders to actually realize a potential threat; however, government officials expressed disdain at the thought of such a scenario.|$|E
