40|$|The {{prediction}} of low-level convergence lines over northeastern Australia {{such as those}} which give rise to the “morning glory ” phenomenon and the north Australian cloud line (NACL) are investigated using MesoLAPS, a mesoscale version of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology’s operational Limited Area Prediction System. The model is used also to examine aspects {{of the dynamics of}} such lines. The predictions were made during the Gulf Lines Experiment in 2002 and are compared here with data collected during the experiment. The ability of MesoLAPS to forecast the convergence lines is investigated in detail for selected cases. In two cases with well-developed southerly <b>morning</b> <b>glory</b> disturbances, the model was able to capture the separation of a borelike disturbance from an airmass change, although the model does not have the resolution to capture the wavelike structures that develop at {{the leading edge of the}} bore waves. An analysis of the entire 44 -day period between 11 September and 24 October shows that MesoLAPS has significant skill in forecasting the lines, but it does not capture all of them. About 85 % of forecasts of northeasterly <b>morning</b> <b>glories</b> and southerly <b>morning</b> <b>glories,</b> or of their nonoccurrence, were correct, while the corre-sponding percentage for the NACL was about 65 %. However, about 15 % of northeasterly <b>morning</b> <b>glories</b> and about 35 % of NACL events that occurred were not forecast by the model. Also, only 6 out of 11 southerly <b>morning</b> <b>glories</b> were forecast. A detailed analysis of the MesoLAPS calculations indicates that the broad-scale generation mechanisms of northeasterly and southerly <b>morning</b> <b>glories</b> are similar and it enables the construction of a conceptual model for the generation of southerly <b>morning</b> <b>glories.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|The <b>morning</b> <b>glory</b> is a {{meteorological}} phenomenon which occurs in northern Aus-tralia {{and takes the}} form of a series of roll clouds. The <b>morning</b> <b>glory</b> is generated by the interaction of nocturnal seabreezes over Cape York Peninsula and propagates in a south-westerly direction over the Gulf of Carpentaria. In the present work, it is shown that the <b>morning</b> <b>glory</b> can be modelled by the resonant flow of a two-layer fluid over topography, the topography being the mountains of Cape York Peninsula. In the limit of a deep upper layer, the equations of motion reduce to a forced Benjamin{Ono equation. In this context, resonant means that the underlying flow velocity of the seabreezes is near a linear long-wave velocity for one of the long-wave modes. The <b>morning</b> <b>glory</b> is then modelled by the undular bore (simple wave) solution of the modulation equations for the Benjamin{Ono equation. This modulation solution is compared with full numerical solutions of the forced Benjamin{Ono equation and good agreement is found when the wave amplitudes are not too large. The reason for the dierence between the numerical and modulation solutions for large wave amplitude is also discussed. Finally, the predictions of the modulation solution are compared with observational data on the <b>morning</b> <b>glory</b> and good agreement is found for the pressure jump due to the lead wave of the <b>morning</b> <b>glory,</b> but not for the speed and half-width of this lead wave. The reasons for this are discussed. 1...|$|R
