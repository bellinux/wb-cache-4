Perhaps their most well known product in this range was the steamroller, which commenced in 1872 with a vertical boilered model for the Royal Gardens, Windsor. Shortly afterward, in 1880, a convertible model (i.e. traction engine or road roller) was introduced. A conventional horizontal boilered model followed this in 1881. The range was developed to encompass {{the whole range of}} weights (3 ton to 12 ton) and styles (<b>tandem</b> <b>roller,</b> triple roller) which enabled them {{to become one of the}} market leaders, with around 300 machines supplied.|$|R

40|$|Samples of filtercake {{from all}} mills in the South African and Swaziland sugar {{industries}} were analysed for nutrient composition {{at regular intervals}} during 1979. It was found that at those mills using the cane diffusion process average P, Ca, Mg, Zn and Mn percentage contents of filtercake were considerably higher than those from factories where <b>tandem</b> <b>rollers</b> were used to crush cane. This can probably {{be attributed to the}} fact that filtercake percent cane from 8 mills with diffusers was on average about half that from factories where mill tandems only were used, the latter producing a filtercake containing a larger amount of extraneous matter, which has a diluting effect on nutrient content. Because a cane producer's allocation of filtercake is based on the amount of cane he delivers to the mill and the average filtercake percent cane for the mill, the amount of nitrogen in...|$|R

5000|$|The {{majority}} of rollers {{were of the}} same basic 3-roll configuration, gear-driven, with two large smooth wheels (rolls) at the back and a single wide roll at the front. (Actually, the wide roll usually comprised two narrower rolls on the same axle, to make steering easier.) However, {{there was also a}} distinctive variant, the [...] "tandem", which had two wide rolls, one front, one rear. Those made by Robey & Co. used their standard steam wagon engine and pistol boiler fitted in a girder frame with rolls and a chain drive to produce a quick-reversing roller suitable for modern road surfaces such as tarmacadam and bituminous asphalt. A number of Robey & Co. <b>tandem</b> <b>rollers</b> were modified to make a further variant, the tri-tandem, which was a tandem with a third roll, mounted directly behind the rear one. Robey supplied the parts, but the modification was undertaken by Goodes of Royston. Ten tandem and two tri-tandem Robey rollers survive in preservation, and one of the tri-tandems is known to have been used to construct parts of the M1 motorway.|$|R
50|$|Road rollers use {{the weight}} of the vehicle to {{compress}} the surface being rolled (static) or use mechanical advantage (vibrating). Initial compaction of the substrate on a road project is done using a padfoot drum roller, which achieves higher compaction density due to the pads having less surface area. On large freeways a four wheel compactor with padfoot drum and a blade, such as a Caterpillar 815/825 series machine, would be used due to its high weight, speed and the powerful pushing force to spread bulk material. On regional roads a smaller single padfoot drum machine may be used. The next machine is usually a single smooth drum compactor that compacts the high spots down until the soil is smooth, and this is usually done in combination with a motor grader to get a level surface. Sometimes at this stage a pneumatic tyre roller would be used. These rollers feature two rows (front and back) of pneumatic tyres that overlap, and the flexibility of the tyres provides a kneading action that seals the surface and with some vertical movement of the wheels, enables the roller to operate effectively on uneven ground. Once the soil base is flat the pad drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface. The next course (road base) would be compacted using a smooth single drum, smooth <b>tandem</b> <b>roller</b> or pneumatic tyre roller in combination with a grader, and a water truck to achieve the desired flat surface with the right moisture content for optimum compaction. Once the road base is compacted, the smooth single drum compactor is no longer used on the road surface (There is however an exception, if the single drum has special flat-wide-base tyres on the machine). The final wear course of asphalt concrete (a.k.a. asphalt or blacktop in North America, or macadam in England) is laid using a paver and compacted using a <b>tandem</b> smooth drum <b>roller,</b> a three-point roller or a pneumatic tyre roller. Three point rollers on asphalt were very common once and are still used, but <b>tandem</b> vibrating <b>rollers</b> are the usual choice now, with the pneumatic tyre roller's kneading action being the last roller to seal off the surface.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{solution of}} synchronized two smooth drum steering of <b>tandem</b> vibratory <b>roller</b> ARP 95. During {{the development of}} this machine was found insufficient synchronization of two drums. The above-described problem was solved by modifying the steering block. The correct evaluation of data measurement and understanding of the machine behaviour led to elimination of the problem. The main result of this thesis is elimination of unsynchronized behavior of two drums. Thanks to this was achieved maximum deviation between two drums 0, 2 °. Synchronized steering is very important for modifying the surface of the asphalt roads around the sidewalks and currently the machine ARP 95 produced by AMMANN is the top of the market {{when it comes to the}} synchronized steering...|$|R
40|$|Many ageing road bridges, {{particularly}} timber bridges, require urgent improvement due to {{the demand}} imposed by the recent version of the Australian bridge loading code, AS 5100. As traffic volume {{plays a key role}} in the decision of budget allocations for bridge refurbishment/ replacement, many bridges in low volume traffic network remain in poor condition with axle load and/ or speed restrictions, thus disadvantaging many rural communities. This thesis examines an economical and environmentally sensible option of incorporating disused flat rail wagons (FRW) in the construction of bridges in low volume, high axle load road network. The constructability, economy and structural adequacy of the FRW road bridge is reported in the thesis with particular focus of a demonstration bridge commissioned in regional Queensland. The demonstration bridge comprises of a reinforced concrete slab (RCS) pavement resting on two FRWs with custom designed connection brackets at regular intervals along the span of the bridge. The FRW-RC bridge deck assembly is supported on elastomeric rubber pads resting on the abutment. As this type of bridge replacement technology is new and its structural design is not covered in the design standards, the in-service structural performance of the FRW bridge subjected to the high axle loadings prescribed in AS 5100 is examined through performance load testing. Both the static and the moving load tests are carried out using a fully laden commonly available <b>three-axle</b> <b>tandem</b> truck. The bridge deck is extensively strain gauged and displacement at several key locations is measured using linear variable displacement transducers (LVDTs). A high speed camera is used in the performance test and the digital image data are analysed using proprietary software to capture the locations of the wheel positions on the bridge span accurately. The wheel location is thus synchronised with the displacement and strain time series to infer the structural response of the FRW bridge. Field test data are used to calibrate a grillage model, developed for further analysis of the FRW bridge to various sets of high axle loads stipulated in the bridge design standard. Bridge behaviour predicted by the grillage model has exemplified that the live load stresses of the FRW bridge is significantly lower than the yield strength of steel and the deflections are well below the serviceability limit state set out in AS 5100. Based on the results reported in this thesis, it is concluded that the disused FRWs are competent to resist high axle loading prescribed in AS 5100 and are a viable alternative structural solution of bridge deck in the context of the low volume road networks...|$|R
5000|$|Between 1965 and 1975, MOWAG built 170 {{electric}} trollies for the Swiss Post. In the 1980s, {{the products}} range had been increased {{by the development}} and construction of three-wheel and four-wheel electric vehicles. The hospitals, airports, municipalities, industrial companies and the post office came {{for a variety of}} their transportation tasks. Many more prototypes of electric cars were built, but none of these vehicles made it to market. For the Mirage IIIS and RS fighter aircraft of the Swiss Air Force, MOWAG and AEG worked together and built the aircraft tractor MOWAG-AEG. In the 1980s, MOWAG built vibratory rollers for road construction. Handheld double vibratory rollers were from 900 kg to 1300 kg, <b>tandem</b> Vibratory <b>rollers</b> from 2000 kg to 3000 kg and 4 [...] "wheeled" [...] rollers from 4.5 t to 18 t. For several decades MOWAG was the sole importer to Switzerland of the Dodge Ram Wagon, these were converted to four-wheel drive fire brigade vehicles, and occasionally police vehicles and ambulances. They were all given the MOWAG Insignia on the front. Private individuals were not allowed to purchase new vehicles, however MOWAG did sell spare parts to privately owned Dodge Ram Wagons. Lately, Mowag has been specializing in armored vehicles for military use, because it is financially more attractive. The main product today is the Piranha. In addition, other armored vehicles are being produced based on the American Hummer / Mowag Eagle, and the Duro. These vehicles comes from the acquired business of Bucher-Guyer. Also Mowag is responsible for spare parts for the :de:Bucher FS 10 Flugzeugschlepper 78 / aircraft tugs who are in use by the Swiss Air Force and JuAir.|$|R
