2500|$|Before {{getting the}} job of director, Watts created images of Nick Fury as Parker's mentor in the story in early [...] "mood reels" [...] saying, [...] "I don’t know what the {{situation}} would be, {{but that would be}} a person he’d want to get in trouble with." [...] Feige said the films of John Hughes would be a major influence and that Parker's personal growth and development would be just as important as his role as Spider-Man. He noted that [...] "at that age, in high school, everything feels like life or death." [...] He also said that the film hoped to use one of Spider-Man's rogues that have not been seen in film yet, and that filming would begin in June 2016. In July 2015, it was reported that Marisa Tomei had been offered the role of May Parker, Peter's aunt. It was also revealed that Daley and Goldstein, after missing out on the director role, had begun negotiations to write the screenplay, and were given three days to present Marvel with their pitch; both confirmed shortly after that they had reached a deal to write the screenplay. The pair had proposed a take on the character that was [...] "diametrically opposed" [...] to the previous Spider-Man films, creating a [...] of all the elements seen in those films and actively trying to avoid re-using them in this film. They chose to focus on the high school aspects of the character and [...] "what {{it would be like to}} be a real kid who gets superpowers", rather than the [...] "drama and weight of the tragedy that leads to the origin of Spider-Man". They felt this would differentiate him from the other MCU superheroes as well. Daley called the film [...] "an origin story of him finding his place in the Marvel [...] Universe", with the writing team wanting the film to [...] "focus on [...] coming to terms with his new abilities and not yet being good with them, and carrying with him some real human fears and weaknesses," [...] such as a fear of heights when he has to scale the Washington Monument. Daley noted, [...] "Even within the context of this movie, I don't think you would feel that fear of heights or even the vertigo the audience feels in that scene if you establish him as swinging from skyscrapers at the top of the movie." [...] The writers also wanted to avoid the skyscrapers of Manhattan because of how often they were used in the other films, and instead wrote the character into locations such as [...] "the suburbs, on a golf course, the Staten Island Ferry, Coney Island, and even Washington D.C." [...] One of the first sequences they pitched was [...] "seeing Spider-Man attached to a plane 10,000 feet up in the air, where he had absolutely no safety net. If you have a character that you’re so familiar with, and you’re familiar with the sort of areas he’s been in, why not turn it on its head and make it something different that people haven’t seen before?" [...] The pair conceded that the film took a more grounded, [...] "low-stakes" [...] approach than previous films, in part to Spider-Man existing in a world with the Avengers, since [...] "if the threat became world-threatening, you would obviously bring in <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>guys</b> to handle it." ...|$|E
