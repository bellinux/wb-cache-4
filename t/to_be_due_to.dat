5|$|A 1.5 hectare {{patch of}} brown earth soil at the {{abandoned}} settlement of Papadil {{is home to}} a thriving population of earthworms, which are rare in the elsewhere poor soil of the island. Some individuals of Lumbricus terrestris have reached tremendous sizes, with the largest weighing 12.7 grams. This is speculated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the good quality soil, and absence of predators.|$|E
5|$|Croup {{is usually}} deemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a viral infection. Others {{use the term}} more broadly, to include acute laryngotracheitis, spasmodic croup, {{laryngeal}} diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. The first two conditions involve a viral infection and are generally milder with respect to symptomatology; the last four are due to bacterial infection and are usually of greater severity.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{research}} {{has revealed that}} the size distributions of the hot classical and cold classical objects have differing slopes. The slope for the hot objects is q = 5.3 at large diameters and q = 2.0 at small diameters with the change in slope at 110 km. The slope for the cold objects is q = 8.2 at large diameters and q = 2.9 at small diameters with a change in slope at 140 km. The size distributions of the scattering objects, the plutinos, and the Neptune trojans have slopes similar to the other dynamically hot populations, but may instead have a divot, a sharp {{decrease in the number}} of objects below a specific size. This divot is hypothesized <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> either the collisional evolution of the population, or <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the population having formed with no objects below this size, with the smaller objects being fragments of the original objects.|$|E

Chronic stress in the male rat showed dendritic retraction and cell loss in the CA3 region but this was not shown in the female.

5|$|The Mayan {{language}} {{family has}} no demonstrated genetic relationship to other language families. Similarities with some languages of Mesoamerica are understood <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> diffusion of linguistic traits from neighboring languages into Mayan {{and not to}} common ancestry. Mesoamerica has been proven to be an area of substantial linguistic diffusion.|$|E
5|$|The {{decline in}} C. graminis is likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> habitat loss {{resulting}} from land improvement and arable conversion, over-grazing, development, drainage and lowering of water-tables due to over-abstraction. Neglect may {{also lead to}} loss or degradation of habitat such as through over-shading or competition of food-plants with invasive species such as Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera). Flood-bank works may deplete or destroy local sub-populations.|$|E

5|$|The {{reasons for}} this drastic {{population}} reduction are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> agricultural improvements, abandonment of extensive management, and deforestation. As {{the area of the}} Gentiana cruciata, the food plant that the P. rebeli depends on, decreases, the P. rebeli population also decreases.|$|E
5|$|Vaccines {{to prevent}} {{certain types of}} {{pneumonia}} are available. Other methods of prevention include handwashing and not smoking. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. Pneumonia believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> bacteria is treated with antibiotics. If the pneumonia is severe, the affected person is generally hospitalized. Oxygen therapy may be used if oxygen levels are low.|$|E

5|$|Cobalt-based blue {{pigments}} (cobalt blue) {{have been}} used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the color was later thought by alchemists <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the known metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore) {{for some of the}} blue-pigment producing minerals; they were so named because they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes upon smelting. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the kobold.|$|E
5|$|DJ Hero was {{generally}} well received by game journalists, praising the {{departure from the}} Guitar Hero series-style of gameplay, {{the use of the}} turntable controller to simulate the motions of a DJ and how the game's difficulty curve helps the player to become skilled on it, and the game's soundtrack; several smaller issues were identified as potential improvements for a possible sequel. However, the game did not perform as strongly as expected by industry analysts, believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the waning interest in music games during 2009; regardless, DJ Hero is stated by NPD Group to be the highest-grossing new intellectual property of 2009 in North America.|$|E

5|$|Deep Impact {{observed}} Comet Garradd (C/2009 P1) from February 20 to April 8, 2012, {{using its}} Medium Resolution Instrument, {{through a variety}} of filters. The comet was 1.75–2.11 astronomical units (AU) (2.62–3.16×108 km) from the Sun and 1.87–1.30 AU from the spacecraft. It was found that the outgassing from the comet varies with a period of 10.4 hours, which is presumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the rotation of its nucleus. The dry ice content of the comet was measured and found to be about ten percent of its water ice content by number of molecules.|$|E
5|$|Early {{drafts of}} Barret's {{background}} featured subtle differences, such as Marlene intended as Barret's biological daughter, {{and his wife}} executed {{in front of him}} by a then-undecided Shinra executive. The attack on Corel was initially written <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the discovery of Mako energy and Shinra's desire to keep its existence a secret. His reunion with Dyne was also different, written to culminate in a duel between the two in Corel's ruins, while Cloud and the others fought investigating Shinra soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Gout affects around 1–2% of the Western {{population}} {{at some point}} in their lifetimes and is becoming more common. Some 5.8 million people were affected in 2013. Rates of gout approximately doubled between 1990 and 2010. This rise is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> increasing life expectancy, changes in diet and an increase in diseases associated with gout, such as metabolic syndrome and high blood pressure. Factors that influence rates of gout, include age, race and the season of the year. In men over 30 and women over 50, rates are 2%.|$|E

5|$|Gravitationally induced {{irregularities}} in Uranus's observed orbit led eventually {{to the discovery}} of Neptune in 1846, and presumed {{irregularities in}} Neptune's orbit subsequently led to a search which did not find the perturbing object (it was later found to be a mathematical artefact caused by an overestimation of Neptune's mass) but did find Pluto in 1930. Initially believed to be roughly the mass of the Earth, observation gradually shrank Pluto's estimated mass until it was revealed to be a mere five hundredth as large; far too small to have influenced Neptune's orbit at all. In 1989, Voyager 2 determined the irregularities <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> an overestimation of Neptune's mass.|$|E
5|$|Haumea has an {{orbital period}} of 284 Earth years, a {{perihelion}} of 35 AU, and an orbital inclination of 28°. It passed aphelion in early 1992, {{and is currently}} more than 50 AU from the Sun. Haumea's orbit has a slightly greater eccentricity {{than that of the}} other members of its collisional family. This is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> Haumea's weak 7:12 orbital resonance with Neptune gradually modifying its initial orbit {{over the course of a}} billion years, through the Kozai effect, which allows the exchange of an orbit's inclination for increased eccentricity.|$|E
5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is a risk factor for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.|$|E
