25|$|Many {{forms of}} amnesia fix {{themselves}} without being treated. However, {{there are a}} few ways to cope with memory loss if that is not the case. One of these ways is cognitive or occupational therapy. In therapy, amnesiacs will develop the memory skills they have and try to regain some they have lost by finding which techniques help retrieve memories or create new retrieval paths. This may also include strategies for organizing information <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it</b> more easily and for improving understanding of lengthy conversation.|$|E
25|$|Russert {{does not}} recall stating to Libby, in this conversation, {{anything}} about the wife of former ambassador Joe Wilson. Although he could not completely {{rule out the possibility}} that he had such an exchange, Russert was at a loss <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it,</b> and moreover, he believes that this would be the type of conversation that he would or should remember. Russert acknowledged that he speaks to many people on a daily basis and it is difficult to reconstruct some specific conversations, particularly one which occurred several months ago.|$|E
500|$|The 20th {{anniversary of}} [...] "We Are the World" [...] was celebrated in 2005. Radio {{stations}} around the world paid homage to USA for Africa's creation by simultaneously broadcasting the charity song. In addition to the simulcast, the milestone was marked by {{the release of a}} two-disc DVD called We Are the World: The Story Behind the Song. Ken Kragen asserted that the reason behind the simulcast and DVD release was not for USA for Africa to praise themselves for doing a good job, but to [...] "use it to do some more good [...] That's all we care about accomplishing." [...] Harry Belafonte also commented on the 20thanniversary of the song. The entertainer acknowledged that [...] "We Are the World" [...] had [...] "stood the test of time"; anyone old enough <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it</b> can still at least hum along.|$|E

Having [...] "brushed up the lyrics a bit", {{as he puts it}} in I, Me, Mine, Harrison retained Newmark and Weeks from the sessions with Wood, and brought in keyboard player Billy Preston and saxophonist and arranger Tom Scott, both of whom would also be part of his all-American tour band. Leng describes [...] "Far East Man" [...] as [...] "the first Harisong to tap into 1970s soul" [...] and notes the [...] "supreme soul credentials" [...] of Newmark, as the former drummer with Sly and the Family Stone, and Weeks, who had supplied the highly regarded basslines on Donny Hathaway Live (1972). Newmark later recalled of his and Weeks' first sessions for Harrison: [...] "We were completely thrilled to be asked to play on his record … It was the most exciting thing to happen to me. I had to keep pinching myself <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it</b> was real." ...|$|E
500|$|Charlene's new romantic style {{wedding dress}} was {{designed}} and made by Isis of Melbourne, a local bridal salon. The dress was made from ivory silk, organza and chantilly lace. A writer for the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery's website observed that it was [...] "in keeping with Charlene's character as the suburban girl-next-door." [...] While the show's costume designer, Nicholas Wakerley, called it [...] "perfect for the time". Wakerley described the dress as being [...] "young and cool" [...] for the time, just like Charlene. He also revealed that the dress fitted Watson's desire for a fairy-tale wedding. When asked what made the dress memorable, fashion designer Alex Perry, stated [...] "There {{are so many things}} going on that it's hard not <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it!</b> The see-through sleeves with a hint of lace, the romantic era-style shoulders, the high neckline and hem." [...] Knowing how popular Minogue and Charlene were at the time, Perry was sure that the dress would have been copied by viewers. Charlene's bridesmaids wore peach taffeta dresses, while the groom and his ushers wore charcoal grey tails.|$|E
500|$|Tronstad {{was born}} in Bærum; the son of Hans Larsen and Josefine Amalie Tronstad, Hans died three months before Leif was born. Leif thus grew up in Sandvika {{with his mother and}} four siblings. He {{graduated}} from middle school in 1918, with top grades in mathematics. He then embarked on thirty months of professional practice in two local electricity companies, which was a requirement to enrol at Kristiania Technical School, a predecessor of the Faculty of Engineering at Oslo University College. When he enrolled in 1920 he chose technical chemistry instead of electronic engineering. He graduated in 1922, the best chemistry student; a fellow student recalled that he [...] "did not have to read anything more than once" [...] in order <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it.</b> In the spring of 1923, he also took the examen artium after attending the Haagaas School for one year. He was ready to enroll at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, but waited one year, possibly wanting to strengthen his personal finances. In the meantime, he started on his compulsory military service.|$|E

500|$|... 2006: In an {{interview}} with ESPN in January, after the Packers had finished with a 4-12 record, Favre admitted {{that if he had}} to make a decision right away he would not come back. He went on to say [...] "There's other days, I go, 'What if it's crunch time, two minutes left, do you want the ball?' I don't know if I do." [...] In March, Favre hears Phil Simms say on Sirius Radio that as long as Favre can physically play the game, he should. Shortly thereafter, Favre confirms he would return to play. After the Packers defeated the Chicago Bears the last game of the season 26-7, Favre choked up during {{an interview}} with Andrea Kremer by saying [...] "If today's my last game, I want <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it.</b> It's tough. It's tough. I'll miss these guys. I'll miss this game. I just want every one to know that...I didn't plan on doing this. Way to put me on the spot." [...] Asked if he was indeed going to retire, Favre responded [...] "We'll see. We'll see. I don't want to say anything right now." [...] After the game, a Packers teammate said that Favre was just as emotional in a speech after the Seattle Seahawks game in 2005 at Lambeau Field when he was all but certain he was going to retire.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} that appeared in Cinefantastique, Argento noted that the film was intended as near-science fiction, taking place [...] "about five or more years in the future... Tenebrae occurs in a world inhabited by fewer people {{with the result that}} the remainder are wealthier and less crowded. Something has happened to make it that way but no one remembers, or wants <b>to</b> <b>remember...</b> <b>It</b> isn't exactly my Blade Runner, of course, but nevertheless a step into the world of tomorrow. If you watch the film with this perspective in mind, it will become very apparent." [...] Argento later insisted that the film was set in an imaginary city, fifteen years in the future, and that the disaster the city's inhabitants were striving to forget was an atomic bomb blast. Despite Argento's claim, Maitland McDonagh observed that this vaguely science-fictional concept [...] "isn't apparent at all" [...] and that no critics at the time noted the underlying futuristic theme in their reviews of the theatrical release of the film. The film critic and author Kim Newman countered that in avoiding a more recognisable Rome in favour of suburbia, Argento had succeeded in giving some parts of the film an almost futuristic sheen. Argento biographer Alan Jones agreed that Argento's intention did come across in these scenes, and Newman cites the on-screen use a videophone as an attempt by Argento to place Tenebrae in the near future.|$|E
2500|$|If Eilmer {{had seen}} Halley's comet seventy-six years earlier in 989, {{he could have}} been born about 984, making him about five or six years old when he first saw the comet, old enough <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it.</b> However the {{periodicity}} of comets was probably unknown in Eilmer's time, and so his remark [...] "It is long since I saw you" [...] could have referred to a different, later comet. Since it is known that Eilmer was an [...] "old man" [...] in 1066, and that he had made the flight attempt [...] "in his youth", the event is placed some time during the early 11th century, perhaps in its first decade.|$|E

Edwards stated, [...] "The way I tried to view it was to imagine Godzilla was a real creature and someone from Toho {{saw him in the}} 1950s and ran back to the studio to make a movie about the creature and was trying their best <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it</b> and draw it. And in our film you get to see him for real." [...] He {{went on to say that}} his Godzilla remains true to the original in all aspects. Edwards also stressed that, [...] "It was important to me that this felt like a Toho Godzilla" [...] and concluded by wishing, [...] "I'd love ours (Godzilla) to be considered as part of the Toho group." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Me²" [...] (1988), Rimmer {{is shown}} {{moving in with}} his double as better company in the next bunkroom over from Lister. Rimmer's double reveals that all of Rimmer's brothers, but not Rimmer, were academy educated. Rimmer claims that this was because his father couldn't afford it. Rimmer also {{mentions}} taking a film course at night school, although he confuses a cartoon showing at the cinema in the episode with Citizen Kane. Lister watches a video of Rimmer's death, where his last words are [...] "gazpacho soup". Demonstrating intense, literal self-hatred, the second cruelly insults and berates the first. Believing that Lister is going to wipe his hologram anyway because of the two Rimmers' constant arguing, Rimmer explained his dying remark as referring to [...] a dinner at the captain's table with six officers, during he made a faux pas where he had his gazpacho soup taken away to be brought back hot, not realising that gazpacho soup {{is meant to be}} served cold. This caused the officers at the table to laugh at him, and he was never invited back. The incident haunted Rimmer {{for the rest of his}} life (and beyond). Gradually, his obsession over the incident caused him <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it</b> as the most disastrous, imbecilic action of his life, and it undermined his self-esteem out of all proportion. Lister, displaying deep empathy, tried to comfort Rimmer, assuring him that [...] "anybody could make a mistake like that." [...] His confession complete, Rimmer prepares to be wiped, but Lister wipes the second Rimmer instead; Lister had allowed Rimmer to believe his [...] "death" [...] was imminent because Lister wanted to know what the [...] "gazpacho soup" [...] remark meant, and he knew that Rimmer would never tell him any other circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|Generally, {{the band}} improvised {{late at night}} and in very dim light, working on [...] "huge" [...] reels of tape, so that they, Eno and Dravs could play for over an hour without needing to change reels. According to Eno, [...] "strange new worlds took shape out of bewildering deserts of confusion, consolidated, lived gloriously {{for a few minutes and}} then crumbled away." [...] They never tried making {{anything}} twice: [...] "once it had gone, we went somewhere else." [...] Ben Fenner, who was engineering the sessions, [...] "attentively and unobtrusively coped" [...] with unpredictable instrument and level changes in near-total darkness, leaving the band and the producers to [...] "wander around our new landscapes." [...] Dravs generally worked on the material alone, improvising at the studio console, as James and Eno were busy recording Laid, but as Laid neared completion, the band and Eno spent more time in the [...] "wild" [...] studio where Wah Wah was being edited, where they worked long days, but there was [...] "always enough going on to prevent any loss of momentum," [...] and [...] "things happened very quickly." [...] Eno completed his mixes for the jams in a single afternoon, where he spent time trying to [...] "get a little of each jam onto DAT because there was so much new work flying around that it was hard <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>it</b> all." [...] He had made 55 mixes that day and never mixed anything twice, not expecting to use these mixes for the final album, but he decided that this fast, impulsive way of working was [...] "right in the spirit of the performances," [...] and that the results, as he described them, [...] "often make a cinematic, impressionistic counterpoint to the elaborate post-industrial drama of Markus' mixes." [...] He commented that [...] "they set each other off well: the combination feels like being at the edge of somewhere - where industry merges with landscape, metal with space, corrupted machinery with unsettled weather patterns, data-noise with insect chatter." ...|$|E
