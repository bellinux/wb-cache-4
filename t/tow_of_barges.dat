50|$|The main lock was {{constructed}} from 1952 to 1957 and is 1200 ft long and 110 ft wide with a lift {{of just over}} 38 ft and large enough to handle a full-length <b>tow</b> <b>of</b> <b>barges.</b> It was put into operation in 1957 {{at a cost of}} 13.5 million dollars. The 1957 lock replaced a 1910-1913 lock. The 1913 lock was a variant of the standardized Panama canal design and was 110 ft wide, 358 ft long and 57 ft tall with a 40 ft lift. There was a 130 ft wide, 463 ft long and 20 ft deep dry dock at the site, both the dry dock and 1913 lock were dewatered in 1977 when a sheet pile and cell closure were built blocking the upstream sides of the lock and dry dock.|$|E
50|$|In 1837, {{with his}} own sloop, Cornell started {{what was to become}} the Cornell Steamboat Company. In 1850, he {{obtained}} the contract for towing D&H Canal Company barges. Following the Civil War, the Cornell Steamboat Line virtually monopolized freight traffic on the Hudson River, dominating the <b>towing</b> <b>of</b> <b>barges</b> well into the 1900s. While the Steamboat Company was the heart of his empire, Cornell engaged in many other related enterprises.|$|R
50|$|Hooligan was a sternwheel-driven {{steamboat}} that {{operated on}} Upper Klamath Lake and the Wood River in the U.S. state of Oregon, {{mostly in the}} <b>towing</b> <b>of</b> <b>barges</b> and log rafts. Built in 1909, Hooligan was sold in 1914, rebuilt as an excursion boat, and renamed Annie Laurie. The last attested powered operation of this vessel was in 1916. It appears to have later been used as an unpowered barge by the California Oregon Power Company, a predecessor to Pacific Power and Light.|$|R
40|$|The real lock {{operations}} with ships and barge convoys areconsidered {{dependent on the}} transport technologies applied, ormore precisely, the kinds of ships/convoys requiring thelockage. The fleet can be divided as follows: (1) groups of singleships, (2) pushed and pulled <b>tows</b> <b>of</b> <b>barges</b> and (3) differentcombinations of previous systems (1) and (2). The groups ofships and tows passing through the lock have extremely stochasticcharacteristics thus forming various arrivals and setvicetime patterns. It means that uniform navigation or strongscheduling between locks and lock operations are not possibleeven though highly sophisticated equipment is at disposal. Therefore, in this paper an analytical method was developedusing bulk queuing systems for the analysis and planning oflock requirements supporting it with numerical example. Thedeveloped methodology {{can be applied to}} determine the meanqueue length of ships - convoys at lock anchorage, withoutblocking behaviour between upstream and downstream navigationfor single-lane traffic...|$|R
50|$|Early tugs used chains in {{the river}} to <b>tow</b> trains <b>of</b> <b>barges</b> up river.The low steam {{pressure}} and low power of early vessels meant that positive traction by pulling on a chain against a deadman or anchor was much more effective.

50|$|On April 18, 2013, the uninspected {{towing vessel}} Dale A. Heller, pushing a <b>tow</b> <b>of</b> 14 <b>barges,</b> {{collided}} with the dam complex {{during a period of}} exceptionally high water flow. Seven barges impacted the dam itself, and four of these sank. Gates 2 and 3 were rendered inoperative and gates 4, 5, and 6 were damaged but remained operational. Damage to the gates contributed to flooding in the city of Marseilles. Repairs to the dam were estimated to cost forty to fifty million dollars.|$|R

50|$|The 1993 Big Bayou Canot {{train wreck}} was the derailing of an Amtrak train on the CSXT Big Bayou Canot bridge in southwestern Alabama, United States, on September 22, 1993.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedSeveral accidents in <b>towing</b> operations <b>of</b> <b>barges</b> or disabled ships in restricted and open waters have made necessary {{the investigation of}} the course keeping stability <b>of</b> <b>towed</b> vessels. In this work a non-linear mathematical model is used to simulate the slow surge, sway, and yaw motions <b>of</b> a vessel <b>towed</b> by a heavy catenary towline. The effect of geometric parameters of the system on the stability of equilibrium configurations is analyzed. It is shown that for certain choices <b>of</b> <b>towing</b> system parameters, dynamic loss of stability may occur which results in qualitatively different asymptotic response. The results of this study identify regions in the parameter space that lead to either safe operations or hazardous system response. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
50|$|A common legend {{claims that}} it was {{travelling}} from New Orleans to Pittsburgh, loaded with cotton and sugar, when it disappeared.

A heavy northwesterly gale with a snowstorm prevented Ossipee from taking the barge in tow. but she stood by to remove the crew if necessary. On 3 December, Cleveco foundered.

5000|$|Rondout Creek was {{the home}} of the Cornell Steamboat Company tugboat fleet, the {{dominant}} towing company on the Hudson from 1880 to the 1930s. The company was started in 1847. At one time it had a fleet of as many as sixty-two tugboats <b>towing</b> <b>barges</b> <b>of</b> coal and many other materials on the Hudson River to New York and other ports. Eventually Cornell had a virtual monopoly <b>of</b> <b>towing</b> on the Hudson River and employed hundreds of workers on their boats and in their workshops along the Rondout Creek. By 1872 more than thirty steamboats were based in Rondout, many of which, as well as a large number <b>of</b> <b>barges</b> and sailing vessels, were engaged in the transportation of stone, coal, cement, brick, and ice.

5000|$|The nearly 12000 mi of U.S. inland and intracoastal {{waterways}} {{maintained by}} the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers includes 191 commercially active lock sites with 237 lock chambers. Some locks {{have more than one}} chamber, often of different dimensions. These locks provide the essential infrastructure that allows tows to [...] "stair-step" [...] their way through the system and reach distant inland ports such as Minneapolis, Chicago, and Pittsburgh. The locks can generally be categorized by three different sizes, as expressed by length. About 15 percent of the lock chambers are 1000 to 1200 ft long, 60 percent are 600 to 999 ft long, and 25 percent are less than 600 ft long. Lock widths are mostly 110 ft. The 1200 ft locks can accommodate a <b>tow</b> <b>of</b> 17 <b>barges</b> plus the towboat, while the 600 ft locks can accommodate at most eight barges plus the towboat. The lock size and tow size are critical factors in the amount of cargo that can pass through a lock in a given period of time.|$|R
2500|$|George R. Vosburg was a steam tug that {{operated}} from 1900 to 1912 on the Columbia River and {{the north}} coast of Oregon south from Astoria to the Nehalem River and Tillamook City.

He expanded into boatbuilding and repair and his tugs <b>towed</b> <b>barges</b> <b>of</b> building stone and assisted ships in Burrard Inlet.

In the United States, south of the Chain of Rocks Lock across from St. Louis on the Mississippi River, the river is open with no locks or impediments other than channel size and depth. Larger boats can run this segment of the river with the maximum <b>tow</b> size <b>of</b> 42 <b>barges</b> southbound and 40+ northbound. A typical River tow might be 35 to 42 barges, each about 200 ft long by 35 ft wide, configured in a rectangular shape 6 to 7 barges long and 5 to 6 barges wide, depending on the number <b>of</b> <b>barges</b> in <b>tow.</b> The whole tow, excluding the towboat, can easily be over 1200 ft long and 200 ft wide, covering over 6 acre and holding {{thousands of tons of}} cargo.|$|R

The measured thud of her engines broke through the splash of water flung off the lighters' bows as they lurched across the swell, and somebody on board was singing a Spanish song.

Motorman, which was a twin-screw tug, fitted with two Gardner diesel engines, each developing , was used to transfer railway carriages from Carlton near Nottingham on the River Trent to Hull in 1927. 160 carriages were built by Cammell Laird for export to India. They could not be transported by rail, because they were built to Indian gauge rather than the British standard gauge, and were therefore too large.
