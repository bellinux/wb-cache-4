Robust <b>tests</b> <b>for</b> stuck-open faults in FETs belonging to these classes are constructed from any stuck-at test set by carefully constructing initialization vectors. Initialization vectors are constructed {{by examining the}} "parity" of the paths in the circuit. Robust <b>tests</b> <b>for</b> additional faults are identified using stuck-open fault simulation.

It is shown that the <b>test</b> <b>for</b> data with binomial variability is asymptotically equivalent to the $ Q_r $ test proposed by Jayasekara et al.

In addition to overidentifying restrictions the considered restrictions may also involve normalizing restrictions. <b>Tests</b> <b>for</b> both types of restrictions are developed and their asymptotic properties are obtained. Under the null hypothesis <b>tests</b> <b>for</b> normalizing restrictions have an asymptotic "multivariate unit root distribution", similar to that obtained for the likelihood ratio <b>test</b> <b>for</b> cointegration, while <b>tests</b> <b>for</b> overidentifying restrictions have a standard chi-square limiting distribution. Since these two types of tests are asymptotically independent they are easy to cotnbine to an overall <b>test</b> <b>for</b> the spccifed identifying restrictions. An overall test of this kind can consistently reveal the failure of the identifying restrictions in a wider class of cases than previous tests which only <b>test</b> <b>for</b> overidentifying restrictions. and phrases, cointegration, normalizing restrictions, overidentifying restrictions, vector autoregressive process,...|$|R
