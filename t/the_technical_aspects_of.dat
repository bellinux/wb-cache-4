The carbon monoxide from the vehicle's exhaust would be channelled into the sealed cabin {{in which the}} victims stood. He discussed <b>the</b> <b>technical</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the idea with a specialist from Kripo's Technology Institute and together they brought the proposal before Heydrich, who adopted it.|$|E

Giacosi also secured the services of the Zamperla Circus, which supplied a number of stuntmen who could play themselves, including Basehart's double, a high-wire artist who refused to perform when firemen arrived with a safety net.|$|E

In addition to BSDcon, three other annual conferences, EuroBSDCon, AsiaBSDCon and BSDCan take place in Europe, Japan and Canada respectively.|$|E
5|$|Shortwave {{listening}}, or SWLing, is {{the hobby}} {{of listening to}} shortwave radio broadcasts located on frequencies between 1700 kHz and 30 MHz. Listeners range from casual users seeking international news and entertainment programming, to hobbyists immersed in <b>the</b> <b>technical</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> radio reception and collecting official confirmations (QSL cards) that document their reception of distant broadcasts (DXing). In some developing countries, shortwave listening enables remote communities to obtain regional programming traditionally provided by local medium wave AM broadcasters.

5|$|The {{growth in}} {{computer}} crime during the 1980s and 1990s caused {{law enforcement agencies}} to begin establishing specialized groups, usually at the national level, to handle <b>the</b> <b>technical</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> investigations. For example, in 1984 the FBI launched a Computer Analysis and Response Team and the following year a computer crime department was set up within the British Metropolitan Police fraud squad. As well as being law enforcement professionals, many of the early members of these groups were also computer hobbyists and became responsible for the field's initial research and direction.|$|E
5|$|Family Guy {{had been}} {{canceled}} in 2002 due to low ratings, but was revived by Fox after reruns on Adult Swim became the cable network's most watched program, {{and more than}} three million DVDs of the show were sold. Much of the plot and many of <b>the</b> <b>technical</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the episode, as well as the title, are direct parodies of the 1959 Alfred Hitchcock movie North by Northwest; in addition, the episode makes use of Bernard Herrmann's theme music from that film. The episode contains many cultural references; in the opening sequence Peter lists 29shows that were canceled by Fox after Family Guy was canceled and says that if all of those shows were to be canceled, they might have a chance at returning.|$|E
5|$|In his youth, Dugan {{was fascinated}} by <b>the</b> <b>technical</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> theatre. He worked as a {{lighting}} designer then transitioned to sound design in 1967. Dugan became interested in achieving the automatic adjustment of sound controls after a frustrating experience staging the musical Hair. His first automixer design was not fully practical but his second design was successful; it used a reference derived from a total of all of its microphone signals. Dugan devised a third improvement which helped prevent audio feedback {{in the presence of}} sound reinforcement loudspeakers. Dugan next produced an automixer design that could be inserted into an existing mixing console. This proved popular for broadcast and live sound applications. Each of Dugan's subsequent automixer models has been of the insertable type.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} project became controversial as environmental protection non-governmental organizations (NGOs) drew public {{attention to a}} possible threat that may arise to seven species of bats. Subsequently, the NGOs alleged that the project is illegal, environmentally unsafe, financially not feasible, and technically questionable. Project legality was disputed because {{it is based on}} a 1999 environmental impact assessment (EIA), while Croatian legislation requires that EIAs must not be more than two years old. Flooding of Vilina Cave is cited as an environmental concern, while the financial issues are based on previous cost overruns by Hrvatska elektroprivreda—the state-owned company planning the development—in other projects. One objection to <b>the</b> <b>technical</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the project is the possibility that the groundwater may trigger earthquakes. Opponents of the project have urged the Prime Minister of Croatia to cancel development of the plant.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} stages of his playing career, Allen became {{increasingly}} influential off the field. After the war, he rejoined the MCC Committee. One of his first actions, prompted by a conversation with Hutton on the West Indies tour, was to secure honorary membership of the club for prominent retired professional cricketers. Allen was heavily involved in an MCC drive to improve youth cricket in the early 1950s. Unlike many of the cricketing Establishment, who saw improved public school and amateur cricket as a priority, Allen wanted the MCC to focus on state schools and boys who did not have access to top-class facilities. In 1951, the club formed the MCC Youth Cricket Association, of which Allen was a member. Another part of the process was the compilation of the MCC coaching book in 1951, which aimed to improve coaching standards throughout the country. Allen worked in collaboration with Harry Altham; Allen was responsible for <b>the</b> <b>technical</b> <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> the publication. In later years, Allen judged this work to improve youth cricket as one of his proudest achievements as an administrator. In his survey of English cricket in the 1950s, Tim Quelch states that the coaching drive, and other similar initiatives at the time, achieved little owing to the limited resources available and because the boys coached had little opportunity to play cricket.|$|E
