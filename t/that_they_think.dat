Signatories attest that: 1) The Masters of Holy Theology written below commend the Inquisitors into Heretical Depravity appointed by {{the authority of the}} Apostolic See in conformity with the Canons, and urge <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> it right to carry out their office zealously.2) The proposition that acts of sorcery can happen with God's permission through sorcerers or sorceresses when the Devil works with them is not contrary to the Catholic Faith, but consonant with the statements of Holy Scripture. Indeed, according to the pronouncements of the Holy Doctors it is necessary to admit that such acts can sometimes happen.3) It is therefore erroneous to preach that acts of sorcery cannot happen, because in this way preachers impede, {{to the extent that they}} can, the pious work of the inquisitors, to the prejudice of the salvation of souls. Nonetheless, secrets that are heard at any time by inquisitors should not be revealed to everyone.4) All princes and Catholics should be urged to think it right to assist such pious vows on the part of the Inquisitors in defense of the Holy Catholic Faith.|$|E

The delays prompted Azalea's fans to campaign an earlier release of the single; in a press release, Azalea explained: [...] "The problem with kids– and I {{was one of these}} people too– is <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> they work in the industry and know how it all works. They're like, 'put 'Bounce' out now or it's gonna flop!'. I'm like, 'I need to promote it first or it's gonna flop!'. It's coming out on July 8 and I need fans to trust their fave on this one because it's for the best. I need to hashtag that– #trustyourfaves." [...] The EP was later released on 5 July 2013 in Germany, 7 July 2013 in the United Kingdom, and 8 July 2013 in Italy and Spain.|$|E
500|$|In 1963 the Beatles were {{prominent}} {{in the public eye}} with the sweeping phenomenon of Beatlemania but, in addition, the Beatles' music was beginning {{to attract the attention of}} serious critics. On 23 December 1963, The Times music critic William Mann published an essay extolling the Beatles' compositions, including their [...] "fresh and euphonious" [...] guitars in [...] "Till There Was You", their [...] "submediant switches from C major into A flat major", and the [...] "octave ascent" [...] in [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand". The Beatles themselves were perplexed by one analysis by Mann: [...] "...one gets the impression <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> simultaneously of harmony and melody, so firmly are the major tonic sevenths and ninths built into their tunes, and the flat-submediant key-switches, so natural is the Aeolian cadence at the end of [...] "Not a Second Time" [...] (the chord progression which ends Mahler's [...] "Song of the Earth")." ...|$|E

500|$|The trial {{portions}} {{consist of}} listening to and cross-examining witness testimonies. The player is given the option to either Press or Present evidence in response to statements made by witnesses. The player can either select their choice or yell into the microphone. By choosing Press, the player questions the witness's statement, which sometimes causes the witness to change their testimony. When finding inconsistencies in the testimony, the player may choose Present {{in order to show}} a piece of evidence <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> contradicts the testimony. The player has a health bar, representing the judge's patience. If the player presents incorrect pieces of evidence or choose incorrect answers to questions in court, health is lost. If the health bar reaches zero, the player loses the game and their client is declared guilty. A new system, known as the [...] "Perceive System," [...] can be used to look for motions or actions made by witnesses that show nervousness, similar to a tell in poker. The game also includes a [...] "Crime Recreation Mode" [...] that models evidence or the crime scene in a 3-D rendition and allow the player to explore the recreation to look for clues. Additionally, the game often recreates the crime in cutscene sequences, allowing the player to observe the action and find contradictions.|$|E
500|$|Corey Taylor {{explained}} that the phrase [...] "All Hope Is Gone" [...] is aimed at the fans' expectations of the band, further elaborating, [...] "Just when you thought you had us figured out, give up all hope because you're never, ever going to." [...] Throughout the album, Taylor incorporates a focus on politics in his lyrics, compared to Slipknot's previous albums. The opening track, [...] ".execute.", features Taylor's response to former United States Vice President Spiro Agnew's speech targeted at Vietnam War protesters. and the second track [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] follows in the same vein. During an interview with Kerrang!, Taylor discussed the song's lyrical content, explaining, [...] "There {{are a lot of}} people who are disguising politics as religion and dictating taste and turning it into policy. And that hurts me." [...] Reviewing for IGN, Jim Kaz said that lyrically, [...] "Gematria (The Killing Name)" [...] gives the listener a [...] "heaping dose of Corey Taylor's caustic bravado". On the track [...] "Wherein Lies Continue", Taylor offers a [...] "dressing down of the world as we know it", explaining, [...] "It kinda goes up against any civilization that takes themselves way too seriously and where the 'leaders' are so pretentious <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> they are deemed to speak for the people." [...] He also proclaimed, [...] "It wouldn't be a Slipknot album if I didn't rag on the recording industry." [...] On [...] "Butcher's Hook", Taylor specifically targets [...] "all those little emo boys", commenting, [...] "People give us shit for wearing outfits, but all of those guys look exactly the same." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team {{felt that}} with previous Ace Attorney games, players could identify with Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice; for Ace Attorney Investigations, they wanted players to be {{immersed in the}} game and feel like they are Edgeworth. He said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> players will feel a connection with Edgeworth and understand his character. As examples of this, Eshiro cited the ability to directly control Edgeworth, and the possibility to see inside his head: the game's logic system was created because the development team wanted to show how Edgeworth thinks. It represents what is happening inside his mind, which Eshiro describes as a [...] "very cool, calm and collected way of thinking". For the rebuttal phases in the game, Eshiro wanted to try out new things that could not be done in courtroom battles: during rebuttals, several characters come in and out during each scene at a rapid pace, providing the player with evidence, to create drama with tension. Ace Attorney Investigations has a larger focus on the environment than previous Ace Attorney titles had; previous titles featured gameplay elements in which the player finds contradictions in suspects' statements, whereas the goal of Ace Attorney Investigations is to find things at the crime scene that contradict the evidence the player has. The game's third person perspective was specifically chosen to be different from the main series' first person perspective, and to show the environment so that players can walk around inside it. The game system was designed specifically for Ace Attorney Investigations, with the aim of being different from the main series; therefore, Eshiro felt that a lot of its features should stay within the Investigations series, and not be used in other Ace Attorney titles.|$|E

2500|$|Stuttering {{could have}} a {{significant}} negative cognitive and affective impact on the person who stutters. [...] It has been {{described in terms of}} the analogy to an iceberg, with the immediately visible and audible symptoms of stuttering above the waterline and a broader set of symptoms such as negative emotions hidden below the surface. Feelings of embarrassment, shame, frustration, fear, anger, and guilt are frequent in people who stutter, and may actually increase tension and effort, leading to increased stuttering. With time, continued exposure to difficult speaking experiences may crystallize into a negative self-concept and self-image. Many perceive stutterers as less intelligent due to their disfluency; however, [...] as a group, individuals who stutter tend to be of above average intelligence. [...] A person who stutters may project his or her attitudes onto others, believing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> he or she is nervous or stupid. Such negative feelings and attitudes may need to be a major focus of a treatment program.|$|E
