5|$|With {{the death}} of his last {{contemporary}} on the faculty in 1845, Tucker resigned his professorship and moved to Philadelphia, where he enjoyed the availability of more libraries, meetings at the American Philosophical Society and a reunion with his friend Robley Dunglison. Nevertheless, there were drawbacks – for one, the lack of accommodation that slaveholding had brought him—he had emancipated all five of his slaves upon his departure from Charlottesville. He later expressed doubt about the wisdom of the latter decision when he learned that <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had,</b> by law, been exiled from Virginia, and shortly thereafter died. As well, the two freed slaves who accompanied him to Philadelphia immediately deserted their posts upon arrival there.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, Leake {{received}} {{the news that}} a convoy of 20 transport ships carrying supplies and reinforcements {{was on its way}} from Lisbon, escorted by four men-of-war. Adverse winds and currents meant that he was unable to sail to assist it against a French naval force that had left Cadiz, and he was forced to wait to see if the convoy would reach its destination. On 18 December, nine of the transports reached the bay, accompanied by two men-of-war, with another seven arriving on 20 December. Four were missing, having been intercepted by the French; <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> been sunk or captured while the last one eventually made it to Gibraltar at the end of December. They brought with them 2,200 men from the Grenadier Guards, Donegal's Foot and Barrymore's Foot, plus some Dutch troops, guns and supplies of powder, tools and food. Further reinforcements arrived between 16–18 January. With Gibraltar safe for the moment, Leake left for Lisbon on 3 January with sick and wounded members of the garrison aboard his ships.|$|E

Three rusty AK-47 rifles and an ammunition magazine were retrieved, along with three small iron ladders for boarding and various tools, including a screwdriver, a spanner, and several fishing knives. As the pirates had only six AK-47 rifles in total and <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> now been confiscated, they had lost half of their firearms and about a quarter of their personnel.|$|E
25|$|As {{the crisis}} unfolded, the Japanese {{government}} sent {{a request for}} robots developed by the U.S. military. The robots went into the plants and took pictures to help assess the situation, but they couldn't perform {{the full range of}} tasks usually carried out by human workers. The Fukushima disaster illustrated that robots lacked sufficient dexterity and robustness to perform critical tasks. In response to this shortcoming, a series of competitions were hosted by DARPA to accelerate the development of humanoid robots that could supplement relief efforts. Eventually a wide variety of specially designed robots were employed (leading to a robotics boom in the region), but as of early 2016 <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> promptly become non-functional due to the intensity of the radioactivity; one was destroyed within a day.|$|E

In October 2009, APG II was superseded by the APG III system. In APG III, 11 of the genera listed above were placed in families, or else became families whose position within their orders was approximately or exactly known. The family Rafflesiaceae {{was placed in the}} order Malpighiales, close to Euphorbiaceae and possibly within it. Mitrastema became a monotypic family, Mitrastemonaceae. This family and Balanophoraceae were placed incertae sedis into orders, that is, their positions within these orders remained completely unknown. Metteniusa was found to belong to a supraordinal group known as the lamiids, which has not been satisfactorily divided into orders. Cynomorium was raised to familial status as Cynomoriaceae, and along with Apodanthaceae and Gumillea, remained unplaced in APG III. Five taxa were unplaced among the angiosperms in APG III because Nicobariodendron and Petenaea were added to the list.|$|E

500|$|Björk {{continued}} to compose {{songs such as}} [...] "Isobel", which was created while she was visiting Reykjavík for Christmas, before bringing it back to Hooper's studio. The song's lyrics were written in collaboration with Icelandic poet Sjón, which was his first songwriting experience. Together with Þór Eldon, Björk's ex-husband {{and member of the}} Sugarcubes, the <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> been part of a circle of anarchist poets in Reykjavík called Medusa and had met the singer while {{she was a member of}} KUKL. Sjón would become a frequent collaborator throughout Björk's career. Intrigued by his work as part of Massive Attack and later by his debut Maxinquaye, Björk also asked trip hop pioneer Tricky to assist in producing the album. An admirer of her voice, Tricky agreed, on the condition that he would work on two tracks on her album and she would contribute two vocals for his album. Their collaboration resulted in the Post songs [...] "Enjoy" [...] and [...] "Headphones"—in addition to [...] "Keep Your Mouth Shut" [...] and [...] "Yoga", which appeared on Tricky's 1996 studio album, Nearly God.|$|E

500|$|Following Peddle's resignation, Leech wrote a conciliatory {{letter to}} Palmer, who responded regretting that the <b>three</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>had</b> not worked together, {{rather than at}} cross-purposes. [...] Palmer had written to suggest an {{alternative}} to the inscription reverse: [...] that the coin depict the Women's Building at the fair. [...] Barber prepared sketches and rejected the idea, stating that the building would appear a mere streak on the coin in the required low relief. [...] Instead, he favored a sketch prepared by Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan, showing a kneeling woman spinning flax, with a distaff in her hands. [...] Leech was not fully satisfied with the proposal, stating that the juxtaposition of Isabella on the obverse and the Morgan reverse was [...] "too much woman". Before accepting Morgan's design, Leech wanted Barber to produce some reverses himself, which the chief engraver did, and Bosbyshell forwarded them to Leech on April 11 and 12. [...] These showed various uses of a heraldic eagle. [...] After considering these efforts, Leech decided on Morgan's design and wrote to Palmer accordingly, stating that [...] "the distaff is used in art to symbolize patient industry, and especially the industry of women." [...] In response, the Lady Managers suggested the use of the building's portal, and asked if it was possible to place a living person on the coin. [...] Leech stated that Secretary Carlisle had selected the distaff reverse, and his determination was binding.|$|E
