From 1935–38 the dam was raised to increase its capacity for water supply and power generation. The dam, aqueduct and appurtenant hydroelectric systems are collectively known as the Hetch Hetchy Project. Deriving from a largely wild and pristine area of the Sierra Nevada, the Hetch Hetchy supply is some of <b>the</b> <b>cleanest</b> municipal water in the US, requiring only primary filtration and disinfection.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{examines}} <b>the</b> <b>clean</b> intersection hypothesis {{required for}} the expression of the wave invariants, computed from the asymptotic expansion of the classical wave trace by Duistermaat and Guillemin. The main result of this paper is the calculation of a necessary and sufficient condition for an arbitrary Riemannian two-step nilmanifold to satisfy <b>the</b> <b>clean</b> intersection hypothesis. This condition is stated in terms of metric Lie algebra data. We use the calculation to show that generic two-step nilmanifolds satisfy <b>the</b> <b>clean</b> intersection hypothesis. In contrast, we also show that the family of two-step nilmanifolds that fail <b>the</b> <b>clean</b> intersection hypothesis are dense in the family of two-step nilmanifolds. Finally, we give examples of nilmanifolds that fail <b>the</b> <b>clean</b> intersection hypothesis...|$|R
