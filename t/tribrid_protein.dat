40|$|We have {{developed}} an Escherichia coli plasmid vector for the identification and expression of foreign DNA segments that are open reading frames (ORFs). The 5 ' end of ompF, an E. coli gene encoding an abundant outer membrane protein, is used to provide a strong, regulated promoter, translation initiation site, and signal sequence for export from the cytoplasm. This sequence is coupled to the lacZ gene of E. coli so that expression of beta-galactosidase requires ompF transcription and translation signals. However, this hybrid gene is LacZ- because lacZ is out of frame with respect to ompF. Restriction enzyme recognition sites are located between ompF and lacZ to allow convenient insertion of DNA fragments. If an insert is an ORF of the correct length, ompF and lacZ become realigned in frame, resulting in a LacZ+ gene that produces a <b>tribrid</b> <b>protein</b> with the translation product of the insert sandwiched between OmpF and beta-galactosidase. The LacZ+ phenotype thus identifies clones containing an expressed ORF. To demonstrate the vector's utility we inserted a fragment from the herpes virus thymidine kinase gene and used the resulting <b>tribrid</b> <b>protein</b> to raise antibodies that precipitate thymidine kinase from herpes virus-infected cells. We also inserted a fragment from the E. coli lexA gene to produce a <b>tribrid</b> <b>protein</b> that is precipitated by antiserum raised with LexA protein. Thus, tribrid fusion proteins {{can be used to}} produce or detect antibodies and also to identify the product of a cloned gene...|$|E
40|$|A segment {{from the}} pre-s {{region of the}} woodchuck {{hepatitis}} virus (WHV) was inserted into an open reading frame vector allowing for the expression in Escherichia coli of viral determinants {{as part of a}} fusion protein. The bacterially synthesized fusion molecule contained eight amino acids from beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) at the N terminus, followed by 89 pre-s-encoded amino acids and 219 amino acids of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) at the C terminus (beta-gal:pre-s:CAT). This <b>tribrid</b> <b>protein</b> was used to generate antiserum which had a significant titer to the viral portion of the fusion polypeptide. Anti-beta-gal:pre-s:CAT was used in Western blot analysis to identify viral proteins containing pre-s-encoded determinants. Antiserum to the tribrid molecule recognized four WHV polypeptides with molecular masses of 33, 36, 45, and 47 kilodaltons, each of which was also recognized by a monoclonal antibody to WHV surface antigen. Using the same anti-tribrid serum, we also identified analogous polypeptides from ground squirrel hepatitis virus. The antiserum was also used to immunoprecipitate virus particles containing endogenous DNA polymerase activity, indicating that pre-s determinants are found on the surface of mature virions. Based on previous computer studies and the location of pre-s-encoded molecules on the surface of virus particles, a role in hepadnavirus host cell entry is suggested for these polypeptides...|$|E
40|$|The open {{reading frame}} (ORF) that encodes the 226 -amino-acid coat protein ({{hepatitis}} B virus surface antigen [HBsAg]) of hepatitis B virus {{has the potential to}} encode a 400 -amino-acid polypeptide. The entire ORF would direct the synthesis of a polypeptide whose C-terminal amino acids represent HBsAg with an additional 174 amino acids at the N terminus (pre-s). Recently, virus particles have been shown to contain a polypeptide that corresponds to HBsAg with an additional 55 amino acids at the N terminus encoded by the DNA sequence immediately upstream of the HBsAg gene. A novel ORF expression vector containing the TAC promoter, the first eight codons of the gene for beta-galactosidase, and the entire coding sequence for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was used in bacteria to express determinants of the 174 amino acids predicted from the pre-s portion of the ORF. The resulting <b>tribrid</b> <b>protein</b> containing 108 amino acids encoded by pre-s was expressed as one of the major proteins of bacteria harboring the recombinant plasmid. Single-step purification of the tribrid fusion protein was achieved by fractionation on a chloramphenicol affinity resin. Polyclonal antiserum generated to the fusion protein was capable of detecting 42 - and 46 -kilodalton polypeptides from virus particles; both polypeptides were also shown to contain HBsAg determinants. The ability of the polyclonal antiserum to identify polypeptides with these characteristics from virus particles presents compelling evidence that the DNA sequence of the entire ORF is expressed as a contiguous polypeptide containing HBsAg. The presence of multiple promoters and primary translation products from this single ORF argues that the function and potential interaction of the encoded polypeptides {{play a crucial role in}} the life cycle of the virus. Furthermore, the procedure and vector described in this report can be applied to other systems to facilitate the generation of antibodies to defined determinants and should allow the characterization of the epitope specificity of existing antibodies...|$|E
40|$|Aim/hypothesis: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{characterize}} the human salivary proteome and determine the changes in protein expression in two different stages of diabetic retinopathy with type- 2 diabetes mellitus: (1) with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and (2) with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Type- 2 diabetes mellitus without diabetic retinopathy (XDR) was designated as control. Method: In this study, 45 saliva samples were collected (15 samples from XDR control group, 15 samples from NPDR disease group and 15 samples from PDR disease group). Salivary proteins were extracted, reduced, alkylated, trypsin digested and labeled with an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) before being analyzed by an Orbitrap fusion <b>tribrid</b> mass spectrometer. <b>Protein</b> annotation, fold change calculation and statistical analysis were interrogated by Proteome Discoverer. Biological pathway analysis was performed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD 003723 â€“PX 003725. Results: A total of 315 proteins were identified from the salivary proteome and 119 proteins {{were found to be}} differentially expressed. The differentially expressed proteins from the NPDR disease group and the PDR disease group were assigned to respective canonical pathways indicating increased Liver X receptor/Retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) activation, Farnesoid X receptor/Retinoid X receptor (FXR/RXR) activation, acute phase response signaling, sucrose degradation V and regulation of actin-based motility by Rho in the PDR disease group compared to the NPDR disease group. Conclusions/Interpretation: Progression from non-proliferative to proliferative retinopathy in type- 2 diabetic patients is a complex multi-mechanism and systemic process. Furthermore, saliva was shown to be a feasible alternative sample source for diabetic retinopathy biomarkers...|$|R
