50|$|As a {{solution}} to the last-mile problem, satellite systems have application and sharing limitations. The ICE which they transmit must be spread over a relatively large geographical area.

50|$|The {{radiation}} pattern {{and even the}} driving point impedance of an antenna can {{be influenced by the}} dielectric constant and especially conductivity of nearby objects. For a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>antenna,</b> the ground is usually one such object of importance. The antenna's height above the ground, as well as the electrical properties (permittivity and conductivity) of the ground, can then be important. Also, in the particular case of a monopole antenna, the ground (or an artificial ground plane) serves as the return connection for the antenna current thus having an additional effect, particularly on the impedance seen by the feed line.|$|E

5000|$|Since a {{satellite}} was too high, and a <b>terrestrial</b> <b>antenna</b> too low, {{what was needed}} was a platform between the two, covering an area {{of a few hundred}} kilometers in radius [...] - [...] {{about the size of a}} Canadian province. To do this the platform would have to fly at about 70,000 feet (21 km) altitude. Aircraft and helicopters could do this, but only with short endurances. Super-high-altitude aerostats were another possibility. Of the available technologies, helicopters appeared to be too heavy, and aerostats, jokingly referred to as the [...] "Gossamer Hindenberg", were not well understood. An electrically powered ultralight aircraft appeared to be the best solution. At the time, a system using solar cells and batteries was considered too heavy.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of fixed satellite {{systems in the}} shared frequency band depends on the tolerance level of interference between them. Interference disturbs the functionality of the ground station and causes signal degradation. The knowledge of interference level must therefore be known for an optimal satellite design. In this work, we evaluate interference due to hydrometeors for {{a situation in which}} a satellite downlink signal is affected by the signal from a terrestrial microwave network operating at the same frequency as the satellite system in a subtropical station: Durban, South Africa. The evaluation of the transmission loss is based on the modified 3 D bistatic radar equation and the exponential rain cell model for the scattering. The results of intersystem interference for different station separation over frequencies variation, <b>terrestrial</b> <b>antenna</b> gains, and exceedance probabilities are presented. The effect of the additional rain attenuation (Aw) on the satellite signals is also examined. The results point out to some remarkable attenuation differences between the effective transmission loss and the transmission loss statistics for small time unavailability at the frequencies considered in this work. This could be detrimental in link budget design if overlooked...|$|E

50|$|There are no {{requirements}} for new televisions sold in Canada to include digital tuners (as they must in the US market), nor {{are there any}} labelling {{requirements for}} analogue-only receivers; some new televisions {{may be unable to}} tune a digital signal without an external ATSC tuner. , an estimated 900000 Canadians relying on antennas prior to the transition deadline were expected to lose over-the-air television reception by the transition deadline, as they are not ready for the digital transition.

40|$|Most {{satellites}} in a low-Earth orbit (LEO) with demanding {{requirements on}} precise orbit determination (POD) {{are equipped with}} on-board receivers to collect the observations from Global Navigation Satellite systems (GNSS), such as the Global Positioning System (GPS). Limiting factors for LEO POD are nowadays mainly encountered with the modeling of the carrier phase observations, where a precise knowledge of the phase center location of the GNSS antennas {{is a prerequisite for}} high-precision orbit analyses. Since 5 November 2006 (GPS week 1400), absolute instead of relative values for the phase center location of GNSS receiver and transmitter antennas are adopted in the processing standards of the International GNSS Service (IGS). The absolute phase center modeling is based on robot calibrations for a number of <b>terrestrial</b> receiver <b>antennas,</b> whereas compatible antenna models were subsequently derived for the remaining <b>terrestrial</b> receiver <b>antennas</b> by conversion (from relative corrections), and for the GNSS transmitter antennas by estimation. However, consistent receiver antenna models for space missions such as GRACE and TerraSAR-X, which are equipped with non-geodetic receiver antennas, are only available since a short time from robot calibrations. We use GPS data of the aforementioned LEOs of the year 2007 together with the absolute antenna modeling to assess the presently achieved accuracy from state-of-the-art reduced-dynamic LEO POD strategies for absolute and relative navigation. Near-field multipath and cross-talk with active GPS occultation antennas turn out to be important and significant sources for systematic carrier phase measurement errors that are encountered in the actual spacecraft environments. We assess different methodologies for the in-flight determination of empirical phase pattern corrections for LEO receiver antennas and discuss their impact on POD. By means of independent K-band measurements, we show that zero-difference GRACE orbits can be significantly improved from about 10 to 6 mm K-band standard deviation when taking empirical phase corrections into account, and assess the impact of the corrections on precise baseline estimates and further applications such as gravity field recovery from kinematic LEO positions...|$|R
50|$|Diplexers {{are also}} used in the home to allow a direct {{broadcast}} satellite TV dish <b>antenna</b> and a <b>terrestrial</b> TV <b>antenna</b> (local broadcast channels) to share one coaxial cable. The dish antenna occupies the high frequencies (typically 950 to 1450 MHz), and the TV antenna uses lower television channel frequencies (typically 50 to 870 MHz). In addition, the satellite also gets a DC to low frequency band to power the dish's block converter and select the dish antenna polarization (e.g., voltage signaling or DiSEqC). The diplexer is useful in homes that are already wired with one cable, because it eliminates the need to install a second cable. For the diplexer to work, the existing cable {{must be able to}} pass the satellite frequencies with little loss. Older TV installations may use a solid dielectric RG-59 cable, and that cable may be inadequate. RG-6 cable is typically used for satellite feed lines.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{called a}} [...] "beam antenna", or [...] "parasitic array", the Yagi is very widely {{used as a}} high-gain antenna on the HF, VHF and UHF bands.

[...] The bandwidth of a Yagi antenna, the frequency range over which it has high gain, is narrow, a few percent of the center frequency, and decreases with increasing gain, so it is often used in fixed-frequency applications. The largest and best-known use is as rooftop <b>terrestrial</b> television <b>antennas,</b> [...] but it is also used for point-to-point fixed communication links, in radar antennas, and for long distance shortwave communication by shortwave broadcasting stations and radio amateurs.|$|R
