50|$|Traditionally, {{buckskin}} was a {{most important}} material used for clothing, boots, moccasins, house covers and storage. Women prepared <b>the</b> <b>hides</b> {{and many of the}} products made from it. They scraped <b>the</b> <b>hides</b> to remove all fur, then left them outside to freeze. The next step was to stretch <b>the</b> <b>hide</b> on a frame. They rubbed it with a mixture of animal brain and pine needle tea to soften it. <b>The</b> dampened <b>hide</b> was formed into a ball and left overnight. In the morning, it would be stretched again, then placed over a smoker to smoke and tan it. <b>The</b> <b>hide</b> was left overnight. <b>The</b> finished <b>hide</b> was called buckskin.|$|R

5|$|Borobudur {{attracted}} {{attention in}} 1885, when Yzerman, the Chairman of the Archaeological Society in Yogyakarta, made a discovery about <b>the</b> <b>hidden</b> foot. Photographs that reveal reliefs on <b>the</b> <b>hidden</b> foot {{were made in}} 1890–1891. The discovery led the Dutch East Indies government {{to take steps to}} safeguard the monument. In 1900, the government set up a commission consisting of three officials to assess the monument: Brandes, an art historian, Theodoor van Erp, a Dutch army engineer officer, and Van de Kamer, a construction engineer from the Department of Public Works.|$|E

50|$|Preparing hides {{begins by}} curing them with salt. Curing is {{employed}} to prevent putrefaction of the protein substance (collagen) from bacterial growth {{during the time}} lag from procuring <b>the</b> <b>hide</b> to when it is processed. Curing removes water from <b>the</b> <b>hides</b> and skins using a difference in osmotic pressure. The moisture content of hides and skins is greatly reduced, and osmotic pressure increased, {{to the point that}} bacteria are unable to grow. In wet-salting, <b>the</b> <b>hides</b> are heavily salted, then pressed into packs for about 30 days. In brine-curing, <b>the</b> <b>hides</b> are agitated in a saltwater bath for about 16 hours. Curing can also be accomplished by preserving <b>the</b> <b>hides</b> and skins at very low temperatures.|$|R

2500|$|In early Anglo-Saxon England <b>the</b> <b>hide</b> {{was used}} as the basis for {{assessing}} the amount of food rent due from an area (known as feorm).

This may be done on a rack with a stretching tool, or by hand. Often <b>the</b> <b>hide</b> is stretched against a steel cable or a rounded steel or wooden blade (with care not to cut <b>the</b> <b>hide).</b> This must be done until <b>the</b> <b>hide</b> is completely dry and no longer cool to the touch or else the finished buckskin will be stiff, and will have to be dressed and stretched over again.|$|R

5000|$|The wet-scrape method {{involves}} scraping <b>the</b> wet <b>hide</b> on {{a smooth}} downward-slanting log or fleshing beam with {{the upper end}} at stomach or sternum level.

40|$|Web {{pages are}} used popularly and {{frequently}} today because {{the message in}} the pages can be fast spreading {{all over the world}} in real-time. A kind of new approach is constructed for <b>the</b> webpage information <b>hiding.</b> <b>The</b> <b>hiding</b> data is composed of the length of secret, the checksum and the secret data. The secret message is required for modification using forward transform technology before hiding. A kind of grouping 5 -bit scheme and algorithm are proposed to convert <b>the</b> <b>hiding</b> data into some invisible characters. It can hide 10 bits in each end tag of page line. In the extracting process, the message is recomposed as the coupling relationship. <b>The</b> <b>hiding</b> process and algorithms are stated in detail. The experiments are implemented with some well-known homepages of portal websites. The results show that the new approach can not only keep <b>the</b> <b>hiding</b> effects, but also increase <b>the</b> <b>hiding</b> capacity largely.
