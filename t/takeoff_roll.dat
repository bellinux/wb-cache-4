5|$|At 14:50 CDT, Flight 191 {{pushed back}} from gate K5 and was cleared to taxi to runway 32R.

Everything looked normal as the flight began its <b>takeoff</b> <b>roll</b> at 15:03.|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, a Learjet {{was cleared}} {{to take off}} at Blue Grass Airport on runway 22, but mistakenly turned onto runway 26. Takeoff {{clearance}} was canceled by the local controller {{prior to the start}} of the <b>takeoff</b> <b>roll.</b>|$|E
5|$|On October 31, 2000, {{the crew}} of Singapore Airlines Flight 006 mistakenly used a closed runway for {{departure}} from Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, Taipei.

25|$|During August 1955, three C-123B Providers {{underwent}} 60 takeoff {{and landing}} tests from unimproved ground with loads from empty to 51,350lb gross. Landing rolls ranged from 700 to 950 feet, while <b>takeoff</b> <b>rolls</b> ranged from 1080 to 2168 feet. Primary test craft was C-123B-3-FA, 54–559, c/n 20008, which eventually {{went to the}} Republic of Vietnam Air Force.|$|R
5|$|The Sea Dart {{began as}} Convair's entry in a 1948 U.S. Navy contest for a {{supersonic}} interceptor aircraft. During the time, {{there was much}} skepticism about operating supersonic aircraft from carrier decks. So {{in order to address}} this issue, U.S. Navy ordered many subsonic fighters. The worry had some foundation, since many supersonic designs of the time required long <b>takeoff</b> <b>rolls,</b> had high approach speeds, and were not very stable or easy to control—all factors that were troublesome on a carrier.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} day, sea level, no wind, <b>takeoff</b> {{and landing}} <b>roll</b> is 100 m.|$|R
5|$|There are {{a number}} of views on the {{potential}} uses of Type I and II fluids. The use of Type I fluid raises concern because its holdover time is shorter than the holdover time for Type II fluid under certain conditions. Both fluids are under scrutiny for their environmental impacts, and it is uncertain if Type II fluid diminishes the runway coefficient of friction since the fluid rolls off the airplane during the <b>takeoff</b> <b>roll.</b> Also, the use of either type fluid may result in a temporary degradation in the airplane's aerodynamic performance, a reduced stall margin, and an increase in drag.|$|E
5|$|Several {{experienced}} {{pilots who}} were at the airport {{at the time of the}} accident testified that they considered the weather at that time unsuitable for flight, as a thunderstorm seemed to be forming or moving over the field. In addition, investigators determined that the weight of the aircraft during its <b>takeoff</b> <b>roll</b> exceeded its maximum allowable takeoff weight by 96lbs, which would have increased the stall speed by about two percent. Since the aircraft was flying in moderate to heavy rain, the NTSB calculated that the water flowing on the wings would have further increased the stall speed by about 1.5%. A higher stall speed reduces the margin of safety at slower airspeeds, such as during a climb.|$|E
5|$|A 1948 {{review of}} the entire F-84 program {{discovered}} {{that none of the}} F-84B or F-84C aircraft could be considered operational or capable of executing any aspect of their intended mission. The program was saved from cancellation because the F-84D, whose production was well underway, had satisfactorily addressed the major faults. A fly-off against the F-80 revealed that while the Shooting Star had a shorter <b>takeoff</b> <b>roll,</b> better low altitude climb rate and superior maneuverability, the F-84 could carry a greater bomb load, was faster, had better high altitude performance and greater range. As a temporizing measure, the USAF in 1949 committed US$8million to implement over 100 upgrades to all F-84Bs, most notably reinforcing the wings. Despite the resultant improvements, the F-84B was withdrawn from active duty by 1952.|$|E

5000|$|In Vietnam, the hot, {{humid air}} robbed even the {{upgraded}} A-7D and A-7E of power. <b>Takeoff</b> <b>rolls</b> were lengthy, and fully armed aircraft struggled to reach 500 mph (800 km/h).

(A-7A wing flap systems were either fully extended or fully retracted. The A-7A flap handle did not have the microswitch feature of later models that permitted the flaps to be slowly raised by several degrees per tap of the flap handle as airspeed slowly increased during max-weight takeoffs.) ...|$|R
25|$|During <b>takeoff</b> <b>roll</b> at 11:42 p.m {{local time}} (03:42 UTC), the captain {{found that his}} air speed {{indicator}} (ASI) was not working properly, but chose not to abort takeoff. The co-pilot's ASI was functional.|$|E

50|$|The city of Oakland {{looked into}} the {{construction}} of an airport starting in 1925. In 1927 the announcement of the Dole prize for a flight from California to Hawaii provided the incentive to purchase 680 acres in April 1927 for the airport. The 7,020-foot-long runway was the longest in the world at the time, and was built in just 21 days to meet the Dole race start. The airport was dedicated by Charles Lindbergh September 17. In its early days, because of its long runway enabling safe <b>takeoff</b> <b>rolls</b> for fuel-heavy aircraft, Oakland was the departing point of several historic flights, including Charles Kingsford Smith's historic US-Australia flight in 1928, and Amelia Earhart's final flight in 1937. Earhart departed from this airport when she made her final, ill-fated voyage, intending to return there after circumnavigating the globe.|$|R

Of the 115 people on board, 47 sustained injuries, with 2 seriously injured, including the pilot.|$|E
25|$|On New Year's Day 1945, Whisner {{was one of}} 12 Mustang pilots led by Meyer {{that had}} started their <b>takeoff</b> <b>roll</b> when a large {{formation}} of FW-190s and Bf-109s hit the field.

25|$|Between 2 February and 6 March 1949, the Air Proving Ground {{conducted}} {{tests in}} conjunction with Wright-Patterson AFB {{to determine if the}} Republic F-84D Thunderjet had improved shortcomings in earlier models of the fighter. These concluded that the F-84 range, acceleration, versatility, load carrying ability, high altitude climb, and level flight speed exceeded that of the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star. The F-84 was inferior to the F-80, however, in shortness of <b>takeoff</b> <b>roll,</b> low altitude climb, and maneuverability.|$|E

50|$|The South African Air Force (SAAF) {{grounded}} their {{fleet of}} PC-7 MkIIs after a crash on 15 January 2008. The aircraft went down shortly after takeoff from Overberg Air Force Base in the Western Cape Province. SAAF Lieutenant-Colonel Chris Meiring, 58, died {{shortly after the}} crash. The aircraft was flying to Langebaanweg Air Force Base for maintenance but shortly after <b>takeoff</b> it <b>rolled</b> and flew into the ground. The cause {{is believed to have}} been a structural problem.|$|R
25|$|The small rudder of the Bf 109 was {{relatively}} ineffective at controlling the strong swing {{created by the}} powerful slipstream of the propeller during the early portion of the <b>takeoff</b> <b>roll,</b> and this sideways drift created disproportionate loads on the wheel opposite to the swing. If the forces imposed were large enough, the pivot point broke and the landing gear leg would collapse outward into its bay. Experienced pilots reported that the swing was easy to control, {{but some of the}} less-experienced pilots lost fighters on takeoff.|$|E
25|$|Pilots, {{including}} {{the present day}} pilots of the Commemorative Air Force’s Fifi, {{one of the last}} two remaining flying B-29s, describe flight after takeoff as being an urgent struggle for airspeed (generally, flight after takeoff should consist of striving for altitude). Radial engines need airflow to keep them cool, and failure to get up to speed as soon as possible could result in an engine failure and risk of fire. One useful technique was to check the magnetos while already on <b>takeoff</b> <b>roll</b> rather than during a conventional static engine-runup before takeoff.|$|E
25|$|Electric {{propulsion}} {{was introduced}} in mid-2014 and allows self-launching. A handful have been sold (and some were retrofitted to earlier sold models). <b>Takeoff</b> <b>roll</b> distance is 50 m and rate of climb when fully charged is 2.5 m/s. It can run at full power for 11 min on one charge. The electrical motor uses 10.5kW at 3800 rpm, and propeller delivers 37 daN when flying at 75 km/h. Storage is a 14s1p Lithium polymer battery (Kokam) with 40Ah capacity, delivering 2.07 kWh, maximum 58.8V and maximum continuous current 200A.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} flight tests was {{conducted}} to evaluate the reduction of <b>takeoff</b> ground <b>roll</b> distance obtainable from a rapid extension of the nose gear strut. The NASA Quiet Short-haul Research Aircraft (QSRA) used for this investigation is a transport-size short takeoff and landing (STOL) research vehicle with a slightly swept wing that employs the upper surface blowing (USB) concept to attain the high lift levels required for its low speed, short-field performance. Minor modifications to the conventional nose gear assembly {{and the addition of}} a high pressure pneumatic system and a control system provided the extendible nose gear, or 'jump strut,' capability. The limited flight test program explored the effects of thrust-to-weight ratio, storage tank initial pressure, and control valve open time duration on the ground roll distance. The data show that the predicted reduction of <b>takeoff</b> ground <b>roll</b> on the order of 10 percent was achieved {{with the use of the}} jump strut. Takeoff performance with the jump strut was also found to be essentially independent of the pneumatic supply pressure and was only slightly affected by control valve open time within the range of the parameters examined...|$|R
25|$|On December 27, 1968 an Ozark Airlines DC-9 (Flight 982) crashed {{while taking}} off from runway 35 at Sioux Gateway Airport en route to Chicago. The plane was inadequately deiced, causing it to have no control after <b>takeoff.</b> The plane <b>rolled</b> violently 90 degrees to the right causing the wing to strike the ground. The plane came to rest 1181 feet past the runway end. There were no fatalities.|$|R

Even with the spoilers out and landing gear extended, the plane had a very low sink rate and pilots resorted to holding the RB-57Ds into a series of slight stalls to get the aircraft down to the runway.|$|R
25|$|Pan Am Flight 845, a Boeing 747, on 30 July 1971. When {{taking off}} from San Francisco International Airport, the plane struck the {{approach}} lighting system after taxiing onto a much too short runway. After the impact, the plane continued into the <b>takeoff</b> <b>roll,</b> though its fuselage, landing gear, and 3 out of 4 hydraulic systems were badly damaged. After making a full circle over the Pacific Ocean {{for an hour and}} 42 minutes and dumping fuel, the plane made a hard emergency landing at San Francisco, ending on its tail. All 218 passengers survived with just a few minor injuries.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, a tug {{ground unit}} {{properly}} equipped with snow chains {{was used to}} push the aircraft back from the gate. After leaving the gate, the aircraft waited in a taxi line with many other aircraft for 49 minutes before reaching the takeoff runway. The pilot apparently decided not {{to return to the}} gate for reapplication of deicing, fearing that the flight's departure would be even further delayed. More snow and ice accumulated on the wings during that period, and the crew was aware of that fact when they decided to make the takeoff. Heavy snow was falling during their <b>takeoff</b> <b>roll</b> at 3:59p.m. EST.|$|E
25|$|On December 20, 2008, a Continental Airlines Boeing 737-500 {{operating}} as Flight 1404 from Denver International Airport in Denver, Colorado to Bush Airport overran Runway 34R, and caught fire during its <b>takeoff</b> <b>roll.</b> There was no snow or {{ice on the}} runway; however, there were 31-knot (36mph) crosswinds {{at the time of}} the accident. On July 13, 2010 the NTSB report stated the accident's probable cause was the captain's cessation of right rudder input, which was needed to maintain directional control of the airplane, about 4 seconds before the excursion, when the airplane encountered a strong and gusty crosswind that exceeded the captain's training and experience. Of the 115 people on board, at least 38 sustained injuries, at least two of these were injured critically.|$|E
50|$|The {{first of}} 13 YP-43s was {{delivered}} in September 1940, {{the last in}} April 1941. Early testing revealed a strong tendency to yaw during <b>takeoff</b> and landing <b>rolls,</b> fixed by redesigning the tailwheel. Although the aircraft exceeded the initial USAAC performance requirements, by 1941 it was clearly obsolete, lacking maneuverability, armor, or self-sealing fuel tanks. The USAAC felt the basic P-35/P-43 design had exhausted its reserves for further improvement in performance and shifted its interest to the promising P-47.|$|R
25|$|On 2 June 2013, {{investigators}} from the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation of Afghanistan confirmed the load shift hypothesis {{as the starting}} point: three armoured vehicles and two mine-sweeping vehicles, totalling 80 tons of weight, had not been properly secured. At least one armoured vehicle had broken loose on <b>takeoff</b> and <b>rolled</b> backwards, slamming into the airplane's rear bulkhead, puncturing the bulkhead and knocking out the Cockpit Voice Recorder and Flight Data Recorder. This also crippled hydraulic systems 1 and 2 and damaged the horizontal stabilizer components - most notably the jackscrew, which rendered the airplane uncontrollable. Control of the aircraft was therefore lost, with the abnormal pitch-up rotation, stall, and crash to the ground ensuing. The damage to the tail controls and hydraulic systems {{made it impossible for}} the crew to regain control of the aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|On takeoff, only 50% {{engine power}} was {{necessary}} for a <b>takeoff</b> ground <b>roll</b> of about 2000 ft.
