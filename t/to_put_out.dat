5|$|Most {{judgment}} calls made by {{the official}} scorer under this rule occur in three situations: when an infielder, pitcher, or catcher attempts <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> an unforced preceding runner who is attempting to advance one base, when any fielder attempts and fails <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> a forced preceding runner, and when any fielder attempts and fails <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> an unforced preceding runner who returns to their original base. In these situations, the official scorer is required {{to determine whether the}} batter-runner would have safely reached first base if the defense made an ordinary effort to put him out. If the defense could not be reasonably expected to make the play, the batter is credited with a hit, otherwise he is ruled to have reached by fielder's choice. If an error is made on the attempt <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> a preceding runner, that has no impact on this decision. It is instead noted to have occurred in addition to the hit or fielder's choice.|$|E
5|$|All six {{ships were}} {{intended}} to use two sets of Brown, Boveri, & Co. and Wagner turbines or Marine-type turbines built by Germaniawerft and four MAN double-acting 12-cylinder two-stroke diesels. Q and R however, was equipped with an additional four diesels, {{for a total of}} eight. The turbines were powered by four Wagner ultra-high pressure boilers, designed <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> 58 atmospheres of pressure. The propulsion system drove three screws, although four were considered for Q and R. The ships' electrical power was supplied by four generators that produced 2,400kW at 220volts.|$|E
5|$|Between its closing as a rail {{bridge and}} its reopening as a {{pedestrian}} span, the bridge has seen occasional fires; {{two in the}} 1970s, one in 1987 and one in 2008. In 1987 Christmas lights posted on the bridge to promote a toy drive started the fire; both the Jeffersonville and Louisville Fire Departments fought six to eight hours <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> the blaze.|$|E

Lying alone in bed, Sam discovers Jessica pinned to the ceiling with a slash across her stomach. She ignites into flames as Dean breaks in and rescues Sam. While firefighters attempt <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> the inferno, Sam decides to join his brother in the search for their father and the creature that killed their mother and Jessica.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} they had returned, the attack began. Indian warriors set fire to several houses and stables, but a {{favorable}} wind kept the fires from spreading. Children used the water drawn by the women <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> the fires. A flaming arrow landed in baby Richard Johnson's crib, but it was doused by his sister Betsy. Help arrived from Lexington and Boone Station, and the Indians retreated.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 1957, tragedy struck {{when the}} Lathrop Building caught on fire. Firemen {{rushed to the}} scene <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> the blaze and did so quickly, but not before the {{television}} and radio studios on the top floors of the building were destroyed. The News-Miner offices and printing facilities on the lower floors were spared from the flames, but suffered water damage. Due to winter temperatures, the water soon froze. Despite the conditions, the paper was produced on time the next day.|$|E

5000|$|The {{important}} part of the rule is not allowing a player <b>to</b> be <b>put</b> <b>out</b> by hitting him with the ball. This was sometimes called [...] "soaking" [...] or [...] "plugging" [...] the runner. One schoolyard version of the game, kickball, using a large inflated ball, still allows players <b>to</b> be <b>put</b> <b>out</b> by hitting them (below the head area) with this much-softer ball.|$|R

5|$|The air {{groups of}} the sisters were {{decimated}} in the battle, which forced Zuikaku to return to Japan with Shōkaku for resupply and aircrew training, and neither carrier {{was able to take}} part in the Battle of Midway in June. En route to Japan, Shōkaku was caught in a severe storm and nearly capsized as the weight of the water used <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> the fires had compromised her stability. Repairs took three months and she was not ready for action until late August.|$|E
5|$|The {{fears of}} {{terrorism}} received an extra boost from {{the disruption of}} communications and news as facilities were devoured by the fire. The General Letter Office in Threadneedle Street burned down early on Monday morning, through which post passed for the entire country. The London Gazette just managed <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> its Monday issue before the printer's premises went up in flames. The whole nation depended on these communications, and the void which they left filled up with rumours.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} {{portion of}} the relay was problematic. The month-long world tour encountered wide-scale anti-Chinese protests. After trouble in London involving attempts by protesters <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> the flame, the torch was extinguished in Paris the following day. The American leg in San Francisco on 9 April was altered without prior warning to avoid such disturbances, although there were still demonstrations along the original route. The relay was further delayed and simplified after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake hit western China.|$|E

But the mission went badly, with its secrecy blown before Davies emerged from his plane in Hanoi. The Americans were furious, UK diplomats embarrassed and angry and Ho Chi Minh refused to met Davies, who {{had been made to}} look foolish.|$|R
5|$|This {{fire had}} more {{troubles}} {{due to the}} age and condition of the bridge; the wood trusses on the bridge were unsafe for firefighters to scale, due to the fire on the bridge ten years before. Louisville Fire & Rescue chief Greg Frederick decided that firefighters {{were not to be}} sent onto the bridge; a boat from the Harrods Creek Fire Department was used <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> the fire, as Louisville's fire boat did not have a hose that could reach the blaze on the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{ordered his}} men not to harass {{the women on}} the train, but the guerrillas robbed all of the men, finding over $9,000 and taking the soldiers' uniforms. Anderson forced the {{captured}} Union soldiers to form a line and announced that he would keep one for a prisoner exchange, but would execute the rest. He addressed the prisoners, castigating them for the treatment of guerrillas by Union troops. After selecting a sergeant for a potential prisoner swap, Anderson's men shot the rest. Anderson gave the civilian hostages permission to leave but warned them not <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> fires or move bodies. Although he was alerted of the congressman's presence in the town, he opted not to search for him. The guerrillas set the passenger train on fire and derailed an approaching freight train. Anderson's band then rode back to their camp, taking a large amount of looted goods.|$|E
5|$|Bristol, {{the fifth}} ship {{of her name}} {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy, was named after the eponymous city. She was laid down on 23 March 1909 at John Brown & Company's Clydebank shipyard, {{launched}} on 23 February 1910 and completed on 17 December 1910. As of 18 February 1913, the ship was assigned to the 5th Battle Squadron of the reserve Second Fleet at Devonport. On 1 July, Bristol was transferred to the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Second Fleet. Almost six months later, some of her crewmen helped <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> a fire in Portsmouth Dockyard on 20 December; two men were killed fighting the fire.|$|E

Both he and Captain Gillet had been seriously wounded and taken below, but he {{continued}} to order the attack. The brief quiet that had resulted from {{the explosion of the}} Orient was broken by Franklins guns, and the battle resumed. She fought for another hour, but by then she had lost her main and mizzenmasts, nearly all of her cannons had been knocked out, and over half her crew were dead or wounded. She finally struck her colours.|$|E
5|$|On 16 May 1289, the priory {{suffered}} a catastrophic fire. According to an account by Walter of Guisborough, a plumber soldering the lead roof forgot <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> his fire, causing the roof timbers to catch fire and molten lead ran {{down into the}} church below. Much of the building was destroyed and many effects, costly books, chalices and vestments were lost. The canons sought {{to raise funds for}} rebuilding. They petitioned the king to grant them the advowsons of the parish churches of Barnham, Easington and Heslerton, and in 1309 and 1311 the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of Durham rewarded the priory's donors with indulgences granting remission of temporal punishment for sins. Most of the nave and chancel was rebuilt {{with the support of the}} de Brus family, whose coat of arms was displayed on its buildings.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, 1999, the {{spotlights}} {{surrounding the}} Peace Candle were accidentally turned on, {{and the heat}} from the lights ignited a fire among several of the Christmas trees surrounding the structure. Several residents called police and sprayed the flames with fire extinguishers until city firefighters arrived <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> the blaze. Although flames reached as high as 30 feet, only the trees were damaged and the Peace Candle itself was undamaged. The incident spurred discussion about removing the trees altogether, but Easton officials insisted the fire was just a fluke accident. New spotlights were installed in 2000, which lit the candle from top to bottom and focused on the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument {{for the rest of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|Temes was {{commissioned}} into the Danube Flotilla in 1915, {{and was in}} action against the Serbian Army at Belgrade in early October, when the Serbs evacuated {{the city in the}} face of an Austro-Hungarian assault. During the final river crossing and reinforcement of the resulting bridgehead, Temes provided close support. During this task, she attempted to draw fire away from the battle-damaged monitor Enns but after receiving a direct hit in the crew quarters aft, she had to move out of range. She was run ashore <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> fires and stop leaks, before being towed out of the battle area by an armed steamer, and taken to Budapest for repairs.|$|E
5|$|On 27 January 1907, Sperber {{was present}} in Lomé {{for the opening of}} the first {{railroad}} line in German Togoland. Between 1908 and 1909, she conducted an extensive survey of the west-African coast. In February 1909, she visited the ruins of Groß Friedrichsburg, the old capital of the Brandenburger Gold Coast, a colony founded by Frederick William I of Prussia in the 17th century. She thereafter returned to survey work in Kamerun and Southwest Africa. On 6 March 1910, she was transferred to German East Africa to replace Bussard. While en route, her crew helped <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> a major fire in Lüderitz Bay on 15 April. After arriving in East Africa, Sperber conducted the normal routine of visiting ports in the colony. She went to Cape Town for an overhaul from 26 October to 3 December. On 6 March 1911, she received orders to return to Germany for a second time. She arrived in Wilhelmshaven on 29 June, and was decommissioned again on 6 July. She was stricken from the naval register on 16 March 1912 and was thereafter used as a target ship until 1918. She was sold on 7 August 1920 and broken up for scrap in Hamburg in 1922.|$|E
5|$|On March 18, 2015, Chabad Lubavitch {{purchased}} a building previously {{owned by the}} Ossining Heights United Methodist Church, on Campwoods Road {{in the village of}} Ossining. Chabad Lubavitch plans to renovate the building significantly before making it its first permanent synagogue. In June 2015, Saint Mary's Episcopal Church announced its plan to close on July 5, after 175 years in operation. A new community center was in development since as late as 2013. The part of the Briarcliff Manor Public Library building that formerly housed the library was renovated to serve as the community center, with a completion date of 2016 and cost of $1,800,000. On December 12, 2015, the Law Park pavilion was damaged in a large fire described as arson; around 100 firefighters in multiple departments assisted <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>out</b> the fire that night. Damage to the structure was almost entirely confined to its upper level. The village government hired RGR Landscape to restore and improve the structure, reopening it on Memorial Day in 2017. Insurance covered the reconstruction, which retained the building's architectural style, and included a new concession area, an upper terrace with 280 donor-engraved bricks, bathrooms and walkways for ADA compliance, new lighting, and fire suppression and security systems. The village also planted new trees and shrubs replacing fire-damaged foliage.|$|E
