40|$|The {{foundation}} of language teaching has undergone many changes. The {{rise and fall}} of language teaching methods depends upon a variety of factors extrinsic to a method itself and often reflects the influence of profit-seekers and promoters, as well as the forces of the intellectual marketplace. There was always a source of contention among people that what the secret of a method life is. In this paper, the writer investigated why once have various teaching methods come into vogue and then disappeared? Some contradicted the method, while others came to provide a complementary view. The writer with a critical lens questioned <b>the</b> concept of <b>post-method</b> which qualitatively, as Akbari (2008) held, is not that much different from the term method. Furthermore, the author claimed <b>the</b> concept of <b>post-method</b> is not plausible by novice teachers. For <b>the</b> fulfillment of <b>post-method</b> perspectives, <b>the</b> whole system must be touched upon, not just a teacher as the key feature of post method. And if it is said there should be an attempt to find an alternative to method, is it really logical to imagine that even a novice teacher must seek for it? The one who first must be provided with some packages of principles in order to begin his teaching job? There is not a place to discuss whether a teacher should adopt a method or not, but what is plausible is that method is always present everywhere even in the body of <b>the</b> phrase like <b>post-method.</b> <b>The</b> writer, in the paper, attempted to shed lights into the concept of methods, beyond methods, post-method and, in a nutshell, {{what is going on in}} the history of language teaching. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of endangered language learners range from infants to elders, and from proficient speakers acquiring literacy to complete beginners, with {{all levels of}} linguistic competence in between. This paper discusses the need for careful consideration of learner and context characteristics, and presents two complementary frameworks that support teachers in making detailed assessments of the linguistic resources that learners possess, while avoiding the common trap of categorizing learners through deficit perspectives and perpetuating exclusionary education dynamics. <b>The</b> <b>post-method</b> movement in language teaching (Pennycook, 1989; Kumaravadivelu 1994, 2006) offers guidance for teachers facing the need to adapt their practice to learner's diverse linguistic repertoires, expectations, and {{to a range of}} education environments. Beginning with awareness of the socio-cultural context, this framework emphasizes the need to validate teachers in the creation of their own uniquely-appropriate practices, rather than fostering dependence on methods and materials prescribed from outside experts. Foreign and second language teaching methods generally fall far short of meeting the expectations or needs of endangered language learners (Hinton, 2001), and thus teachers need to be equipped to use them flexibly and to innovate in context-appropriate ways. The framework of communicative repertoires (Gumperz & Hymes, 1964; Rymes 2013) can assist teachers in the task of recognizing each learner's receptive and productive language capacities, focusing on the linguistic resources that learners possess, rather than the more common perspective that frames learners as deficient in relation to the target speaker norm. This framework can also help to identify concrete communication goals, and measure linguistic competence achieved. In addition to supporting awareness of learner characteristics and encouraging context-specific innovation, <b>the</b> <b>post-method</b> approach also attends to the potential of language education to highlight and address issues of social inequality. Social power dynamics are significant in all contexts of language education (Tollefson, 1991; Norton, 2000), however it is especially important to consider these factors when working with learners and languages that have in many cases been (or continue to be) subjected to prejudice and hostility through formal education. <b>The</b> <b>post-method</b> approach is thus particularly appropriate for practitioners of endangered language education, allowing for consideration of social factors, attention to learner's communicative repertoires, and active recognition of the many resources available for building successful communication and successful communities of learners.

40|$|Do methods {{still have}} a place in 21 " century {{language}} teaching? To answer this question, an international survey was conducted in the surnmer of 1999. A sample of 800 language teachers world-wide randomly drawn from 17, 800 TESOLers were each given a 2 -page survey. The return rate was 58. 5 % with the actual usable data set of 448, which was analyzed by using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Among the ten commonly recognized teaching methods surveyed, both the Communicative Language Teaching Approach and an eclectic method seem to have the highest rate in familiarity, preference, and use. But when multiple factors, such as teaching contexts, instructional settings, learners' proficiency levels, class size, teaching experience and educational backgrounds of the teachers, and the status of being a native or nonnative English speaking professional were taken into consideration, various patterns and themes emerged. One interesting finding is that Grammar Translation is still used in EFL contexts, in larger classes, and with learners at low proficiency levels, though the ratio between the actual use of this method and teachers' preference does not match. Based on the results of the survey, a new theoretical framework is proposed to conceptualize language teaching methods in <b>the</b> <b>post-methods</b> era...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{looks into}} the area of English {{teaching}} nowadays, considering the post-modern globalization scenario (STIGLITZ, 2004) and the demand to speak such a language, especially for adults. We start by approaching historical and methodological issues, including <b>the</b> <b>post-method</b> (KUMARAVADIVELU, 2003, 2008; LEFFA, 2003, 2008) and the current translingual approach (CANAGARAJAH, 2013), and we also touch on {{the high rate of}} failure when one tries to learn English in Brazil, particularly oral production, according to certain research, such as the one periodically conducted by EF (Education First). Then, we hypothesize that a possible cause for a negative result might be related to affective factors (REVUZ, 1998), reflecting upon the possibility of creating affective bonds and relating to the target language in a scenario of encounter and conflict of differences (ROCHA, 2012). Finally, we propose a reflection to the classroom, from a point of view in which language is discourse, (JORDÃO, 2006, 2007, 2013; KRAMSCH, 1998, 2008 a, 2008 b, 2012, 2013) in order to make students aware of their own and other people’s cultural issues and have a ressignified perspective. As a result, they should feel more comfortable when studying and speaking English towards a better understanding of other cultures...|$|R
40|$|Foreign {{language}} teaching undergoes constant changes {{due to the}} methodological improvement. This progress may be examined in two parts. They are the methods era and <b>the</b> <b>post-methods</b> era. It is not pragmatic today to propose a particular {{language teaching}} method and its techniques for all purposes. The holistic inflexibility of mid-century methods has long gone. In the present day, constructivist foreign language teaching trends attempt to see the learner as a whole person and an individual who may {{be different from the}} other students in many respects. At the same time, the individual differences should not keep the learners away from group harmony. For this reason, current teacher training programs require eclectic teaching matrixes for unit design considering the mixed ability student groups. These matrixes can be prepared in a multidimensional fashion because there are many functional techniques in different methods and other new techniques to be created by instructors freely in accordance with the teaching aims. The hypothesis in this argument is that the collection of foreign language teaching techniques compiled in ELT microteachings for a particular group of learners has to be arranged eclectically in order to update the teaching process. Nevertheless, designing a teaching format of this sort is a demanding and highly criticized task. This study briefly argues eclecticism in language-skills based methodological struggle from the perspective of ELT teacher education...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This {{paper is}} a {{critical}} review of <b>the</b> concept of <b>post-method</b> language teaching. <b>The</b> author first presents a quick review of the history and concept of method and introduces the concept of postmodernism {{as a source of}} influence for post-method-ism.

The postmethod condition: (e) merging strategies for second/foreign language teaching. TESOL Quarterly, 28, 27 - 48.). The paper argues that these two concepts can have the same mode of existence in reality and the difference between them is only a virtual one that would exist {{in the mind of the}} practitioner/expert. Finally, it is further argued that skepticism toward the concept of method and the search for "an alternative " to method (as Kumaravadivelu has put it) would not guarantee the future of practice in the field of language teaching, as this search has not proved to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

30|$|With {{the general}} {{curriculum}} reform, {{the idea of}} glocalization is suggested to {{be integrated into the}} Chinese language curriculum in the near future. The reality provides rational reasons for the appearance of this notion. Students are living and will still live in a globalized world as professionals and citizens. Globalization is not an unfamiliar word to people, which is coined to describe the “heightened form of time/space compression” and the “inevitable” competition among the territories and countries in the world (Maguire 2002). But local contexts are also existing to exert their effect and appear as competitive power with global influence. Meanwhile <b>the</b> <b>post-method</b> rejects <b>the</b> belief in one-size-fits-all method, and gives rise to the need to localize the teaching materials and teaching methodologies in order to better suit the particular language needs and wants of each specific context (Ahmadian & Rad 2014). Thus, glocalization was introduced as a reconciling idea by Robertson 1995. To glocalizing curriculum, curriculum-makers, administrators, teachers, and related professionals should connect the learning outcomes, assessment tasks, teaching methods and supportive service of a program to the international, intercultural, global dimension and local context and focus on what students will experience, instead of what they will learn and how they will demonstrate their learning (Ahmadian & Rad 2014; Betty 2014; Hans & Betty 2015). Therefore, language curriculum needs to ask for the glocalization of learning materials and teaching methods, the relation of instructional issues with both international context and local reality, the involvement of learning cooperation on international and local levels, the communication with people from other countries, and the varieties of assessment tasks requiring both students’ overseas and domestic learning experience, etc., to achieve students’ linguistic, cognitive, emotional and humanistic quality development as a whole.|$|R
40|$|Based on a brief {{background}} of its history, Communicative Language Teaching Approach (CLT) will be critically evaluated as theoretical principles {{as well as}} its practice in teaching English as a foreign language in the Arab world. The field of language teaching has passed through many changes and shifts over the last few decades. Some suppose that the language instruction has at last come of age (Harper, Lively, and Williams, 1998); others consider it as <b>the</b> <b>post-method</b> area (Richards and Rodgers 2001). In general, it is thought that there is no one particular best method that achieves the goals and meets the needs of all learners and teachers. However, I believe that the flexibility of CLT explains why it can continue and dominate the teaching environments. The term Communicative approach is an umbrella for all teaching methods whose goals are improving students’ abilities to communicate. It embraces all kinds of teaching approaches. Most lessons presentations I have seen so far about Task Based Approach, Humanistic Approach and even Total Physical Response Method are communicative. There was communication between the teacher and the students or among students themselves. The purpose of my writing is to highlight some of the difficulties of the application of this approach in the Arab world especially Egypt although I do believe those points of weakness could be easily overcome by a few modifications and regulations. This article is divided into four main sections; the first is an introduction and a historical background about CLT. The second is the CLT theoretical principles with a critical view. The third is a critical evaluation of the CLT practice especially in the Arab World. Finally, there is a conclusion followed by references...|$|R

To this end, a standard English Language Teaching Reflection Inventory (ELTRI) was employed to measure the reflectiveness of 179 English language teachers.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{remarkable}} improvements and modifications in TESOL methodology with <b>the</b> advent of <b>post-method</b> era; however, such changes are rarely implemented in fields like ESP.

Based on a pedagogical framework driven from Hutchinson and Waters’ Learning-Centered ESP approach, it was assumed that such an approach would be effective in changing students’ attitudes towards EAP reading through encouraging the use of effective strategies and learning skills. The participants aged 18 to 22, included 80 engineering students who were divided into an experimental group and a control group. Following a pretest, treatment and a posttest, the obtained data was analyzed using t-test to examine the effect of the independent variable, namely, method of instruction. The findings revealed that learning-centered EAP instruction improves reading attitude of EAP students. In addition, the findings provide implications for all EAP practitioners in general and Asian EAP practitioners in particular...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} focused on the origin and {{definition}} of the communicative language teaching (CLT) approach as well as its major criticisms. The study aims at examination of typical features of CLT to establish the reason why none of the methods or approaches so far has come to replace it; whether it is plausible to suggest that any such method or approach will appear in the future; whether it is possible to describe the current situation as post-method. In order to achieve this goal strengths and weaknesses of the CLT approach have been scrutinised and its influence on <b>the</b> present day <b>post-method</b> state has been explored. The authors state that in spite of all criticisms, CLT has a great impact in the present teaching context. Having given special attention to the description of post methods pedagogy, it is obvious that this condition may be considered as a consequent stage, which has emerged as a result of CLT breakdown. Nevertheless, the term "post-CLT" seems to be general and does not reflect the specificity properly, i. e. coexistence of various approaches and methods with the focus on context requirements...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{intends to}} address the issue of Second Language Teaching (SLT) Dilemma termed by Danesi (2003). It traces the major {{scholastic}} trends to this challenging dilemma in the area of SLT during the past two decades. The study gives a classified overview of two main theoretical trends to resolve this Dilemma. One theoretical trend expresses an ethno-culturally-oriented methodological reaction which focuses on the evolving perspectives on language teaching methods and approaches after <b>the</b> emergence of <b>post-method</b> era. With regard to this trend, the researcher particularly focuses on its two main responses to the SLT Dilemma chronologically listed as: Kumaravadivelu's (1994) "post-method pedagogy" and Larsen-Freeman's (1999) "seven I's". The other theoretical trend expresses a neurolinguisticlly-oriented methodological reaction to the SLT Dilemma which is related to bimodality theory developed by Danesi (2003). The researcher endeavourers to delve into the tenets and principles of these three specific responses to come up with a clear understanding of them which may coherently highlight the two investigated theoretical trends toward the SLT Dilemma accordingly. To this end, the researcher examines the different dimensions of these responses with reference to the following two theoretical questions: (a) why have the pervious methods and approaches failed to tackle the SLT Dilemma?, (b) how can the SLT Dilemma be resolved? In light of such a rationale, the study might be able to compare and elucidate the two investigated theoretical trends and consequently, it might shed more light on the issue of SLT Dilemma from a scholarly outlook...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{submitted}} in a partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Arts in English, 2011. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis. Includes bibliographical references (page 57 - 59). This study {{is concerned with the}} existing methods and approaches that are in action at the tertiary level. It attempts to assess the suitability of the current methods that are used in different private universities of Dhaka from <b>the</b> perspective of <b>post-methods.</b> In <b>the</b> postmethod era, the traditional methods/approaches are thought to be dead, and a method is only considered suitable when it is context sensitive. Our learners, even after studying English for twelve years, fail to acquire sufficient mastery over English. This may happen because of the somewhat inappropriate choice of methods by the teachers. Many a times, teachers of our country execute a given method without judging the context. As a result, a mismatch between the context and the method being implemented becomes obvious and when the learners come to a university, the mismatch may continue. This study aims to see the present situation and suitability of the methods implemented at tertiary level. In other words, the study aims {{to find out if the}} methods are context sensitive. It will provide future researchers a good understanding of the conditions of different methods and approaches. The results of this study can be used to make necessary modifications and enhancements in those approaches. The study uses interviews (semi-structured) to collect data. The findings show that the teachers of private universities in Dhaka make a conscious effort to contextualize features of different methods and approaches and implement them accordingly. At the same time, the teachers need to be aware of a few key issues which the researcher discussed as recommendations, for example, the status of English in Bangladesh, need for local materials, need for "needs analysis" etc. to improve the teaching standard of English of the private universities of Dhaka.
