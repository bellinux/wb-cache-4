50|$|An {{oscillating}} cylinder engine {{cannot be}} reversed {{by means of}} the valve linkage (as in a normal fixed cylinder) because there is none. Reversing of the engine can be achieved by reversing the steam connections between inlet and exhaust or, in the case of small engines, by shifting the <b>trunnion</b> <b>pivot</b> point so that the port in the cylinder lines up with a different pair of ports in the port face. In the latter case, the fixed port face is usually provided with three ports, the central one being the steam feed and the outer two being exhausts, only one of which being in use at any time, depending on the required direction of running.|$|E
50|$|In aviation, {{the term}} {{refers to the}} {{structural}} component that attaches the undercarriage or landing gear to the airframe. For aircraft equipped with retractable landing gear, the <b>trunnion</b> is <b>pivoted</b> to permit rotation of the entire gear assembly.|$|R
5000|$|The AKS-74U {{also has}} a {{different}} sighting system with a U-shaped flip sight instead of the standard sliding notch tangent rear sight. This rear sight has two settings: [...] "ÐŸ" [...] corresponding to a 350 m [...] "point-blank range" [...] battle zero setting and [...] "4-5" [...] (used for firing at distances between 400 - 500 m). The rear sight is housed in a semi-shrouded protective enclosure that is riveted to the receiver's spring-loaded top cover. This top cover hinges from the barrel <b>trunnion,</b> <b>pivoting</b> forward when opened, which also works to unlock the gas tube cover. Both the gas tube and handguard are also of a new type and are shorter than the analogous parts in the AKS-74.For the AKS-74s combined with the 7N6 or 7N10 service cartridges the 350 m battle zero setting limits the apparent [...] "bullet rise" [...] within approximately -5 to +42 cm relative {{to the line of}} sight. Soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing the sights on the center of mass (the belt buckle) of the enemy target. Any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant, as a well-aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier.|$|R
50|$|The {{personnel}} compartment is at {{the rear}} of the hull with the eight infantrymen seated on bench seats, four down each side of the hull. The crew in the rear face inwards. The section leader is the first on the right seat and is provided with a day periscope in the forward part of the personnel compartment roof, on the right side. Access to the personnel compartment is by two doors in the rear of the hull. Two hatches over the roof of the vehicle open to the outside. Mounting sockets for the <b>pivot</b> <b>trunnion</b> of an adaptor mount for the MG 42 machine gun are provided on the front, right, left and rear side of the hatch above the personnel compartment.|$|R
50|$|The {{short drive}} shaft {{operated}} the pivot clamp around the rocket midsection, which could move the rocket 28 mm (~1") forward or backward along its centreline. The rocket midsection was {{fitted with a}} band which included trunnion pins placed in opposition; the pivot clamp held the rocket by the <b>trunnion</b> pins. The <b>pivot</b> clamp was able to rock on a transverse shaft, thus causing the rocket to move along its centreline. After erection of the rocket to a vertical position, it was held suspended above the launch table; by use of the pivot clamp, {{the weight of the}} rocket could be gently lowered onto the launch table until fully taken up, allowing the rocket to be unsecured from the lifting frame, thus dismounting it from the Meillerwagen.|$|R
50|$|The final {{development}} of the Velocette KTT, the Mk VIII KTT was introduced in 1938 at that year's Earls Court Show, {{and was the first}} motorcycle to use the now-conventional swinging-arm rear fork with a shock absorber unit (in this case, an oleo-pneumatic unit built by the Oleo Strut Co. of England). The rear suspension system was designed by Veloce development engineer Harold Willis, and was inspired by the Oleo strut landing gear on the DeHavilland Hornet he borrowed at the Midland Aero Club, while his beloved DeHavilland 'Moth' was undergoing repair. Contact with the Oleo company led to several pairs of air shocks built for Veloce in 1936, for which the factory's racing rigid-frame racers (similar to the Mark VII KTT) were adapted with a swinging-fork rear end and bolt-on subframe for the seat. The experimental first swinging-arms used an adapted steering head lug turned sideways, with the cup-and-cone bearings retained. Production Mark VIII KTTs used a more conventional bronze bush and <b>trunnion</b> shaft <b>pivot</b> for the one-piece rear fork. The first experimental swing-arm machines were raced by the factory in the 1937 season, and introduced as the Mark VIII KTT the next year, for sale to the public.|$|R
50|$|In {{full-size}} engines, {{the steam}} and exhaust ports are usually {{built into the}} <b>pivot</b> (<b>trunnion)</b> mounting. However, separate valves may be provided, controlled by the oscillating motion. This allows the cutoff timing to be varied to enable expansive working, as in, for example, the engine in the paddle ship PD Krippen. Alternatively, expansive working can also be provided by means of Woolf compounding, just as compactly if the two expansion stages are provided {{on either side of}} a single piston within a single cylinder, all arranged as a trunk engine (however, an oscillating cylinder engine does not benefit from the advantage of compactness that a trunk engine would otherwise provide, as it has that already from its own design features). Each approach to expansive working compromises the advantage of simplicity but still retains the advantage of compactness.|$|R
