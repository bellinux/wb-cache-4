5|$|Photochemotherapy, or PUVA, is {{considered}} superior to phototherapy because {{it produces a}} longer-lasting tolerance of the radiation that initiates the outbreak. When treatment first begins, the main goal is {{to build up the}} patient's tolerance to UVA radiation enough {{so that they can be}} outdoors without suffering an episode of solar urticaria. Therefore, treatments are regulated at three per week while constantly increasing the exposure to UVA radiation. Once <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> reached an adequate level of desensitization, treatments are reduced to once or twice per week.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all cases}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy arise from a pituitary adenoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. In 80%, <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> been previously unaware of this (although some will retrospectively report associated symptoms). It was previously thought that particular types of pituitary tumors were {{more prone to}} apoplexy than others, but {{this has not been}} confirmed. In absolute terms, only a very small proportion of pituitary tumors eventually undergoes apoplexy. In an analysis of incidentally found pituitary tumors, apoplexy occurred in 0.2% annually, but the risk was higher in tumors larger than 10mm ("macroadenomas") and tumors that were growing more rapidly; in a meta-analysis, not all these associations achieved statistical significance.|$|E

Regina and Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) have also shown up, since Regina is the emergency contact for John Doe. She claims that she had found him {{on the side of the}} road unconscious without any memory of what or who he was. As Regina takes Henry home, Emma, Mary Margaret, and the sheriff decide to investigate what happened and visit the security room. They encounter the janitor Leroy (Lee Arenberg), and the security guard Walter, who was sleeping on the job (since he is actually Sleepy). Emma and the others discover that John Doe went out into the woods.|$|E
30|$|The PaO 2 /FiO 2 {{ratio was}} {{calculated}} according to blood gas analysis. Mechanical ventilation was terminated if: (1) <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> were cooperative; (2) <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> were hemodynamically stable; (3) <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> adequate and strong cough reflex; (4) <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> positive end-expiratory pressure < 5 cmH 2 O; (5) <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> pressure support < 10 cmH 2 O; and (6) <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> a successful spontaneous breathing trial.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>patients</b> {{who were}} {{evaluated}} and {{reported in this}} study met with the following criteria: (1) <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> to give permission {{to be included in}} the study, (2) <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> to have a Mason II fracture (the radial head intra-articular should be in one piece and displacement should be at least 2  mm), (3) the follow-up period of <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> should be longer than 11  months, (4) <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> must not <b>have</b> another osseous and ligamentous pathology, and (5) surgical treatment of <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> be applied as osteosynthesis via the use of screws.|$|R
30|$|The final {{diagnosis}} in {{the present}} case was primary PCI because surgery showed no mechanical obstruction and <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> no history of any condition associated with PCI. <b>The</b> <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> previously been diagnosed as having COPD based on honeycomb-like changes seen on pulmonary CT scans. However, the fibrotic changes were limited to the pulmonary bases and <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>had</b> no pulmonary symptoms. Asymptomatic COPD seemed unlikely to have a significant association with PCI.|$|R
5|$|Narrowed {{areas may}} be bridged by a stent, a hollow tube {{that keeps the}} duct open. Removable plastic stents are used in {{uncomplicated}} gallstone disease, while permanent self-expanding metal stents with a longer lifespan are used if the obstruction is due to pressure from a tumor such as pancreatic cancer. A nasobiliary drain may be left behind; this is a plastic tube that passes from the bile duct through the stomach and the nose and allows continuous drainage of bile into a receptible. It {{is similar to a}} nasogastric tube, but passes into the common bile duct directly, and allows for serial x-ray cholangiograms to be done to identify the improvement of the obstruction. The decision on which of the aforementioned treatments to apply is generally based on the severity of the obstruction, findings on other imaging studies, and whether <b>the</b> <b>patient</b> <b>has</b> improved with antibiotic treatment. Certain treatments may be unsafe if blood clotting is impaired, as the risk of bleeding (especially from sphincterotomy) is increased in the use of medication such as clopidogrel (which inhibits platelet aggregation) or if the prothrombin time is significantly prolonged. For a prolonged prothrombin time, vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma may be administered to reduce bleeding risk.|$|E
