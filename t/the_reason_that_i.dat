2500|$|On October 24, 2000, Linkin Park {{released}} {{their debut}} album, Hybrid Theory, through Warner Bros. Records. Bennington and Shinoda wrote {{the lyrics to}} Hybrid Theory based on some early material. Shinoda characterized the lyrics as interpretations of universal feelings, emotions, and experiences, and as [...] "everyday emotions you talk about and think about." [...] Bennington later described the songwriting experience to Rolling Stone magazine in early 2002, [...] "It's easy to fall into that thing– 'poor, poor me', that's where songs like 'Crawling' come from: I can't take myself. But that song is about taking responsibility for your actions. I don't say 'you' at any point. It's about how I'm <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel this way. There's something inside me that pulls me down." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 22, President Barack Obama was {{interrupted}} at {{a speech in}} New Hampshire {{by a group of}} Occupy Wall Street protesters who attempted to chant slogans during the speech; the protesters later delivered a paper message to the press, which read, [...] "Mr. President: Over 4,000 peaceful protesters have been arrested while bankers continue to destroy the economy. You must stop the assault on our First Amendment rights. Your silence sends a message that police brutality is acceptable. Banks got bailed out. We got sold out." [...] The crowd quickly drowned the protesters out with chants of “Obama!” Obama then responded, [...] "I appreciate you guys making your point. Let me go ahead and make mine." [...] Later in the speech, Obama said, “Families like yours, young people like the ones here today— including the ones who were just chanting at me— you’re <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> ran for office in the first place.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "For <b>the</b> simple <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> like you--at least, when you're {{in a good}} temper--and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think you're a good painter." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I have {{counted the}} bottles {{in the case}} and know very well whose gin it was," [...] I replied ambiguously, for <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had done nothing of the sort. [...] "Show me the diamond." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former Vice President of the United States and {{environmentalist}} Al Gore {{wrote an}} introduction to the 1992 edition of Silent Spring. He wrote: [...] "Silent Spring had a profound impact...Indeed, Rachel Carson was one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> became so conscious of the environment and so involved with environmental issues ... has had as much or more effect on me than any, and perhaps than all of them together." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "We {{finally got}} this opportunity," [...] said Michael Jaffe. [...] "I had chased the rights {{numerous}} times. One of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> never {{actually tried to}} make it as a series was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> didn't believe a network would ever let us make it the right way. Then A came along, and Allen Sabinson. I've known him for years and years. He swore he'd let me make it the right way.|$|R
60|$|Having <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had {{for being}} suspicious, I even {{suspected}} this poor actor. I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission. Therefore I {{glanced at him}} as we walked on together, but said nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel all}} the unkindness of it, Ailie, {{but it must}} be so; and that was <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{attempted}} to conceal myself from you, as I suspected you would not let me part from you so easily." ...|$|E

5000|$|Kuras said of {{her desire}} to shoot 4 Little Girls, [...] "I was really {{interested}} because my background is in political documentaries ... <b>I</b> always felt <b>that</b> one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had got into filmmaking was <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wanted to use my craft {{to be able to}} say something about the human condition, however I could, in my own humble way. For me this was an opportunity to make a small contribution." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an interview, Powers {{explained}} to The Guardian newspaper why {{he wrote the}} book: [...] "One of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wrote this book {{was the idea that}} people kept saying: 'What was it like over there?' It seemed that it was not an information-based problem. There was lots of information around. But what people really wanted was to know what it felt like; physically, emotionally and psychologically. So <b>that's</b> why <b>I</b> wrote it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{it is all}} <b>the</b> more <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{should not}} let the poor dear little fellow go about wrapped up in somebody's old shawl!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lucie, I recall {{these old}} {{troubles}} in <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have to-night for loving you better than words can tell, and thanking God for my great happiness.

60|$|It {{is not my}} {{intention}} to give all the particulars of that game of football between Brill and Roxley, for <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have many other things to tell about.

6000|$|... "I did {{not answer}} the charge [of conspiracy] before, for <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not suppose {{there was a man}} in America with a heart so corrupt as to believe such a charge could be true.

6000|$|... "I did {{not take}} Lord Chalkclere for <b>the</b> very <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do take Mr. Headley. I want a husband who will guide me, not one whom I must guide." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is it so indeed? Well, <b>the</b> more <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{should make}} haste to follow her. Begone {{and leave me}} to do the deed alone," [...] and he stepped towards the sword.|$|R
60|$|I {{have just}} come from a hunt, in which I mortally wounded a wild hog, and as my boots are full of thorns I can't write any longer than this paper will contain, for it's all I've got, because I'm too tired to write any more for <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have no news to tell.|$|E

[...] "I know that you are the owner of the periodical, but I can't receive any suggestion from you, for <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have given.

60|$|My hand, however, {{he shook}} in farewell, for Cetewayo was always {{friendly}} to me, {{perhaps because he}} thought I might be useful to him. Also, as I learned afterwards, he was very pleased with me for <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had refused my share of the Amakoba cattle, and that he knew I had no part in this proposed marriage between Saduko and Nandie, of which, indeed, I now heard for the first time.|$|E

2500|$|Huckabee said on May 16 that, if his {{campaign}} falters, {{he would have}} to think long and hard before agreeing to become a vice-presidential candidate on a ticket whose presidential candidate believes that abortion should remain legal. [...] "This is an issue to me that is very critical. It's one of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> got into politics because I believe the manner in which we treat innocent life and the matter in which we respect human life, at whatever stage ... is an incredibly powerful statement about who we are as a people," [...] Huckabee told reporters in a conference call in South Carolina.|$|R
60|$|I {{should have}} replied that Love was {{commonly}} reputed blind, but for <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> always was restrained--and {{this was not}} the least of my miseries--by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her, when she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham. My dread always was, that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy disadvantage with her pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious struggle in her bosom.|$|E
60|$|It {{happened}} thus. I went to Rome on my {{way home}} from India, and stayed there a while. On the day after my arrival I wrote my name in the book of our Minister to Italy at that time, Sir Alfred Upton, not because I wished him to ask me to dinner, but for <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had heard of him as a man of archeological tastes and thought that he might enable me to see things which otherwise I should not see.|$|E
6000|$|That day is memorable {{to me for}} <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{first saw}} Bettie and Hattie and Agnes, the prettiest girls in the township. Hattie and Bettie were both fair-haired and blue-eyed but Agnes was dark with great velvety black eyes. Neither of them was over sixteen, but they had all taken on the airs of young ladies and looked with amused {{contempt}} on lads of my age. Nevertheless, I {{had the right to}} admire them in secret for they added the final touch of poetry to this visit to [...] "the Grove School House." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 2005 interview, Ray said, [...] "the two {{influences}} <b>that</b> were <b>the</b> main <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{got into}} bodybuilding {{in the first}} place, was bodybuilders Chris Dickerson and Bob Paris." [...] In a 1990 documentary, Ray cited François Benfatto as a major inspiration, along with Paris.|$|R
5000|$|In his art book, Gundam Fix, Katoki said: [...] "Do people, like myself, {{spend time}} imagining {{what it would}} be like if Gundam robots were {{actually}} present on the streets of our cities? Are you sure you're not limiting yourself to the images that were offered in the animated series? One of <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> fell in love with Gundam was that it excites me to imagine {{what it would be}} like if these machines actually existed, and <b>I</b> worry <b>that</b> other fans may be losing out..."

6000|$|The {{best way}} in which I could serve him, since Grouchy was behind, was to wait here until they were past, and then to resume my journey, to see the Marshal, and to give him his orders. If he {{advanced}} upon {{the rear of the}} English instead of following the Prussians all would be well. The fate of France depended upon my judgment and my nerve. It was not the first time, my friends, as you are well aware, and you know <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had to trust that neither nerve nor judgment would ever fail me. Certainly, the Emperor had chosen the right man for his mission. [...] "The prince of messengers" [...] he had called me. I would earn my title.|$|R
