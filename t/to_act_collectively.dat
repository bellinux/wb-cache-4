2500|$|The {{market for}} {{corporate}} control, where parties compete to buy controlling stakes in companies, {{is seen by}} some as an important, although perhaps limited, mechanism for the board of directors' accountability. Because individual shareholders {{may not be as}} likely <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>collectively</b> as a majority shareholder, the threat of a takeover when a company share price drops, heightens the prospect that a director is removed from office by an ordinary resolution under CA 2006 section 168. Since 1959 the UK has taken the approach that directors, particularly of public companies, should do nothing with the effect of frustrating a takeover bid, unless shareholders approve it by a majority {{at the time of the}} takeover. Rule 21 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers consolidates this now. Typical takeover defence tactics, routinely found in US corporate law, led by Delaware, include issuing extra shares to everyone but a takeover bidder to dilute their stake unless the bidder has the board's consent to buy shareholders' shares (a [...] "poison pill"), paying a takeover bidder to go away ("greenmail"), merely selling a key company asset to a friendly third party, or engaging in large share buyback schemes. In the US, defensive tactics must merely be employed in good faith, and be proportionate to the threat posed with regard to factors like the offer price, timing and effect on the company's stakeholders. Moreover, Delaware directors can often only be removed for a [...] "good reason" [...] (fought out in court) with a board classified into directors a third of whom will be removable in any given year. This makes hostile takeovers very difficult, unless a bidder promises the incumbent board large golden parachutes in return for their consent. After much debate, the EU's newly implemented Takeover Directive decided to leave member states the option under articles 9 and 12 of whether to mandate that boards remain [...] "neutral".|$|E
6000|$|We {{boast that}} we {{belong to the}} Nineteenth Century and are making the most rapid strides of any nation. But {{consider}} how little this village does for its own culture. I {{do not wish to}} flatter my townsmen, nor to be flattered by them, for that will not advance either of us. We need to be provoked--goaded like oxen, as we are, into a trot. We have a comparatively decent system of common schools, schools for infants only; but excepting the half-starved Lyceum in the winter, and latterly the puny beginning of a library suggested by the State, no school for ourselves. We spend more on almost any article of bodily aliment or ailment than on our mental aliment. It is time that we had uncommon schools, that we did not leave off our education when we begin to be men and women. It is time that villages were universities, and their elder inhabitants the fellows of universities, with leisure--if they are, indeed, so well off--to pursue liberal studies the rest of their lives. Shall the world be confined to one Paris or one Oxford forever? Cannot students be boarded here and get a liberal education under the skies of Concord? Can we not hire some Abelard to lecture to us? Alas! what with foddering the cattle and tending the store, we are kept from school too long, and our education is sadly neglected. In this country, the village should in some respects take the place of the nobleman of Europe. It should be the patron of the fine arts. It is rich enough. It wants only the magnanimity and refinement. It can spend money enough on such things as farmers and traders value, but it is thought Utopian to propose spending money for things which more intelligent men know to be of far more worth. This town has spent seventeen thousand dollars on a town-house, thank fortune or politics, but probably it will not spend so much on living wit, the true meat to put into that shell, in a hundred years. The one hundred and twenty-five dollars annually subscribed for a Lyceum in the winter is better spent than any other equal sum raised in the town. If we live in the Nineteenth Century, why should we not enjoy the advantages which the Nineteenth Century offers? Why should our life be in any respect provincial? If we will read newspapers, why not skip the gossip of Boston and take the best newspaper in the world at once?--not be sucking the pap of [...] "neutral family" [...] papers, or browsing [...] "Olive Branches" [...] here in New England. Let the reports of all the learned societies come to us, and we will see if they know anything. Why should we leave it to Harper & Brothers and Redding & Co. to select our reading? As the nobleman of cultivated taste surrounds himself with whatever conduces to his culture--genius--learning--wit--books-- paintings--statuary--music--philosophical instruments, and the like; so let the village do--not stop short at a pedagogue, a parson, a sexton, a parish library, and three selectmen, because our Pilgrim forefathers got through a cold winter once on a bleak rock with these. <b>To</b> <b>act</b> <b>collectively</b> is according to the spirit of our institutions; and I am confident that, as our circumstances are more flourishing, our means are greater than the nobleman's. New England can hire all the wise men in the world to come and teach her, and board them round the while, and not be provincial at all. That is the uncommon school we want. Instead of noblemen, let us have noble villages of men. If it is necessary, omit one bridge over the river, go round a little there, and throw one arch at least over the darker gulf of ignorance which surrounds us.|$|E

This paper argues that this current policy context poses a threat to the quality of educational research and places severe limitations on the contribution it can make to the generation of public knowledge and the utilisation of research in educational policy-making and public debate. Focusing upon two contemporary issues—restrictive research contracts and conditions and the changing nature of ethical guidelines—the paper explores how the political context of recent years has led to changes in research contracts and ethical and political responses of formal associations. The paper concludes by examining a number of positions the educational research community can take in such a restrictive political climate, arguing, in particular, that professional organisations need <b>to</b> <b>act</b> both <b>collectively</b> and politically if they are to make any inroads into improving contractual conditions to protect quality research...|$|R

40|$|Migrant {{communities}} {{participate in}} the reconfiguration of civil society in places of settlement. Among {{the consequences of the}} large-scale culturally diverse postwar migration was in the regeneration, broadening and diversification of Australian civil society. This contribution outlines with unique data generated from ethnic communal organisations in Sydney the process of confluence of migration and civil society out of settlement constraints. Consecutive waves of migrants experienced settlement constraints that impaired the quality of their lives in a welfare state. Migrants, mostly left <b>to</b> themselves, <b>acted</b> <b>collectively</b> <b>to</b> improve the quality of their existence, to enable co-ethnic communication, and to mediate with the rest of society. They established thousands of grassroots organisations through collective mobilization of scarce resources. Many ethnic collectives through collective action appropriated their own communal places to satisfy spiritual, educational, welfare and other secular needs alongside the other forms of institutional development. Ethnic communal places, representatives of the re-territorialized cultures, heritages and elements of civil society, signify migrant inclusion in Australian social structures, including in civil society. Through development of community capital, ethnic collectives impacted on civil society in an environment experiencing limited cross-cultural social exchange. This development is representative of the unique structure of Australian civil society...|$|R

40|$|Social {{capital is}} a resource, a {{propensity}} for mutually beneficial collective action that communities possess to different extents. Communities {{with high levels}} of social capital are able <b>to</b> <b>act</b> together <b>collectively</b> for achieving diverse common objectives. While the concept of social capital is valid universally, the measure of social capital will vary by context. It must be related in each case to aspects of social relations that assist mutually beneficial collective action within that particular cultural context. A locally relevant scale of social capital was developed to assess whether and how social capital mattered for development performance in 69 north Indian villages. Variables corresponding to other bodies of explanation, including extent of commercialization, relative stratification, and relative need were also examined, but a combination of high social capital and capable agency was found to associate most closely with high development performance. Agency is important particularly in situations where institutions are not available that enable citizens to connect with the state and with markets. The productivity of social capital is considerably reduced on account of this institutional gap in the middle. Development performance can be improved in these situations by adding to the stock of social capital and also through enhancing agency capacity.

50|$|However, the {{proprietary}} governance speculated by the Frame of 1683 did {{not function}} effectively after Penn returned to England in 1684. He {{relied on the}} council <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as governor <b>collectively</b> {{in the first few}} years during his absence. However, the council neglected Penn’s constitutional authority and promulgated laws without obtaining approval from Penn or the King. Penn subsequently appointed five commissioners to replace the council as his deputy executive. Having granted any three of the commissioners a power to enact, annul or vary laws “as if I myself were there”, he instructed the commissioners to annul the laws passed without his approval. However, the commissioners never carried out such instructions. In 1687, Penn appointed John Blackwell to replace the five commissioners as a single executive. As an aggressive Puritan governor, Blackwell clashed with the Quakers’ assembly immediately after he was appointed. The disorder in Pennsylvania and William III’s increasing distrust in Penn led to the suspension of Penn’s charter as the colonial proprietor in 1692.|$|R

In most accounts of academic McCarthyism there have been two historiographical tendencies.

30|$|North (1990) {{states that}} {{institutions}} and organisations are different but related terms. Institutions comprise of rules, norms of behaviour, conventions {{and values that}} bind individuals together, structures that humans impose on their dealings with each other. On the other hand, organisations consist of groups of individuals engaged in a purposive activity (North 1990, 1992). Institutions are frequently viewed by sector such as the economic, social and political environments that shape the social structure (Grootaert and Bastelaer 2001). Such institutions encompass informal [local and horizontal] and formal [hierarchical and vertical] associations and relationships. Societal, institutional structures (organisations) include education, health services, the economy, and political and juridical sectors. Institutional relationships include macro-level governance, political regime, the rule of law, the court system and civil and political liberties [as part of quality]. Adger (2003) argues that the relations between actors and institutions {{play a significant role}} in shaping people’s ability <b>to</b> <b>act</b> when <b>collectively</b> adapting <b>to</b> and recovering from natural disasters. Situations of humanitarian crisis require greater openness of institutions to engage with individuals or organisations. An understanding of the existing institutions and organisations and the linkages with individuals in vulnerable urban settings would then provide an opportunity for both national and international aid organisations to engage better with the affected population. Therefore, analysing linking capital in vulnerable urban settings would aid in obtaining not only a better understanding of the existing institutions and organisations but also the amount of trust people may have in these institutions and the access to the services (e.g. jobs, microfinance, education and justice) they provide in vulnerable urban settings.|$|R

50|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that game theory explains the stability of any form of political government. Taking the simplest case of a monarchy, for example, the king, being only one person, does not and cannot maintain his authority by personally exercising physical control over all or even any significant number of his subjects. Sovereign control is instead explained by the recognition by each citizen that all other citizens expect each other to view the king (or other established government) as the person whose orders will be followed. Coordinating communication among citizens to replace the sovereign is effectively barred, since conspiracy to replace the sovereign is generally punishable as a crime. Thus, {{in a process that}} can be modeled by variants of the prisoner's dilemma, during periods of stability no citizen will find it rational to move to replace the sovereign, even if all the citizens know they {{would be better off if}} they were all <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>collectively.</b>|$|E
50|$|Four Types of State- Centered Analysis There {{are four}} {{approaches}} to the state-centered analysis which are the state- autonomy, the state-capacity, the political-opportunity, and the state-constructionism. All four of these approaches emphasize a set of causal mechanisms which are “those processes whereby states shape, enable, or constrain economic, associational, cultural, and even social-psychological phenomena” (Goodwin 2001: 36). The state-autonomy perspective emphasizes on {{the autonomy of the}} state officials from the dominant social class. This dominant class includes politicians and military officials, among others, and they sometimes develop interests that are opposing to those interests of the popular will. The state-capacity approach focuses on the material and organizational capacity of the state officials’ political agenda. The political-opportunity approach on the other hand “emphasizes how the apparent tolerance, or responsiveness of states or “polities” influences the ability of mobilized social groups <b>to</b> <b>act</b> <b>collectively</b> and/or to influence state policies” (Goodwin 2001: 38). Lastly, the state-constructionism approach focuses on how the states share and alter the identities, goals, and ideas of actors in civil society.|$|E
