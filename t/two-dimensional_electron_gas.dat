25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} ways of fabricating a QPC. It can be realized in a break-junction by pulling apart a piece of conductor until it breaks. The breaking point forms the point contact. In a more controlled way, quantum point contacts are formed in a <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>electron</b> <b>gas</b> (2DEG), e.g. in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. By applying a voltage to suitably shaped gate electrodes, the electron gas can be locally depleted and {{many different types of}} conducting regions can be created in the plane of the 2DEG, among them quantum dots and quantum point contacts. Another means of creating a QPC is by positioning the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope close to the surface of a conductor.|$|E
25|$|The random {{disorder}} in the potential {{landscape of the}} <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>electron</b> <b>gas</b> {{plays a key role}} in the observation of topological sectors and their instantons (phase transitions). Because of the disorder, the electrons are localized and thus they cannot flow across the sample. But if we consider a loop around a localized 2D electron, we can notice that current is still able to flow in the direction around this loop. This current is able to renormalize to larger scales and eventually becomes the Hall current that rotates along the edge of the sample. A topological sector corresponds to an integer number of rotations and it is now visible macroscopically, in the robustly quantized behavior of the measurable Hall current. If the electrons were not sufficiently localized, this measurement would be blurred out by the usual flow of current through the sample.|$|E
