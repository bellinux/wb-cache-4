5|$|In 1944, {{writing as}} Major Harold Ridley FRCS RAMC, the English {{ophthalmic}} surgeon published a short {{paper in the}} British Journal of Ophthalmology on spitting snakes and {{an account of the}} composition and action of snake venom in general. From his own experiences in wartime Ghana, then known as the Gold Coast, Ridley described snake venom ophthalmia in a 30-year-old labourer named Gogi Kumasi, who was cutting grass when a Black-necked cobra raised its head from <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> forcibly spat venom toward the man's right eye from a four- or five-feet distance. Ridley treated the man and followed his case until the eye had fully recoveredafter about a week. In conclusion, after discussion on the therapeutic uses of snake venom, he conjectured that in the future diluted venom or a constituent of venom might be used as a powerful anaesthetic in some cases of ophthalmic surgery.|$|E
5|$|Briscoe {{passed the}} Chip Ganassi Racing drivers {{after they were}} held up by slower cars to move into second place on lap 29. Green-flag pit stops began four laps later. Wilson spun {{at the end of}} the backstretch while braking for turn ten on the 36th lap after his right-rear shock {{absorber}} failed and drove slowly to his pit box to repair damage to his vehicle. Danica Patrick attempted to pass Baugette around the inside on lap 39, but lost control of her car and ran wide into the infield grass section and rejoined the track in 17th without damaging to her suspension. Andretti's front wing came apart on lap 46 while holding up four cars, and Scheckter ran wide as the four cars passed Andretti. The first full course caution of the event was necessitated on the following lap when Alex Lloyd spun into <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> stalled his engine. Andretti made a pit stop for a replacement front wing during the caution. Racing resumed at the start of lap 51 with Power leading Castroneves, Briscoe and Dixon. Shortly afterward, de Silvestro was hit from behind by Viso who overheated his brakes, and went into the turn one tyre barrier, causing the second caution. Viso avoided making contact with teammate Tracy (who took avoiding action) on the same lap.|$|E

25|$|After {{a devastating}} prairie fire {{destroyed}} much of <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> timber {{in the area}} around Wood Mountain, Saskatchewan, many First Nations and Métis people were driven by a bison shortage and an increasing population to seek out new settlements. Many settled along the Milk River, south of the 49th parallel, and the Frenchman River, one of its tributaries in Saskatchewan. A number of them settled in the area known by the Métis as Talle de Saules (clump of willows) and Hart Rouge, now known as Willow Bunch.|$|E
25|$|Some {{areas of}} land in Boho are managed under the Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) scheme, with more (ecologically) {{significant}} areas being designated as Areas of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI) or as Special Areas of Conservation (SAC). Farmers receive ESA payments for low-intensity farming, i.e. cutting a meadow after <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> wild herbs have seeded (ESA scheme). Livestock (cows) were traditionally fed hay in the winter months as far up as the early 1980s, but modern methods of silage has overtaken this practice due to its higher nutritional value.|$|E

25|$|This {{incident}} occurred on 12 April 1988. It involved a BAC One-Eleven 500 (registration: G-AYWB). The aircraft, {{which had been}} cleared to land on Gatwick's runway 08L (the airport's standby runway), inadvertently landed on the parallel taxiway. An air traffic controller in Gatwick's control tower, who spotted the BIA One-Eleven coming in {{to land on the}} taxiway parallel to the emergency runway, ordered a British Airways Boeing 737 that had just entered the same taxiway to vacate it immediately. This resulted in the 737 taxiing right into <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> the One-Eleven stopping 100-200m {{to the west of the}} 737's position.|$|E
25|$|Although fire {{can occur}} {{during the growing}} or the dormant seasons, managed fire during the dormant season is most {{effective}} at increasing <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> forb cover, biodiversity and plant nutrient uptake in shortgrass prairies. Managers must also take into account, however, how invasive and non-native species respond to fire {{if they want to}} restore the integrity of a native ecosystem. For example, fire can only control the invasive spotted knapweed (Centaurea maculosa) on the Michigan tallgrass prairie in the summer, because this is the time in the knapweed's life cycle that is most important to its reproductive growth.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant Bowen's {{settlement}} at Risdon Cove {{had been}} poorly sited. He had chosen {{it based on}} the advice of an earlier expedition, that had found the creek at Risdon swollen with fresh water. Bowen's contingent had arrived on 11 September 1803 at the end of what was probably a wet winter. The grassy woodlands around Risdon Cove were verdant and lush, and the creek was at full flow. However, after a long hot summer between December 1803 and February 1804, during which the Risdon Cove encampment received not a single day of rain whatsoever, the creek was dried up completely and <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> woodlands parched.|$|E

25|$|During {{the early}} morning {{of the first day}} of battle, small parties of Indians dashed up to the sand bar on horseback several times, but they did little damage to the scouts. The scouts killed their horses for breastworks and dug pits into the soft sand behind them. When the scouts opened fire, the Indians {{attacked}} the island on both sides. Later they crawled through <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> shot through the grass. Several scouts who were killed or wounded were hit by the Indian snipers hidden in the grass. The Indians surrounded the island and repeatedly attacked the Scouts. Three scouts hidden in hole on the riverbank shot several Indians from the shore.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July 1968, {{the port}} flap {{operating}} rod of G-AMAD, an Airspeed Ambassador operated by BKS Air Transport failed due to fatigue thereby allowing the port flaps to retract. This {{resulted in a}} rolling movement to port {{which could not be}} controlled during the approach, causing the aircraft to contact <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> swerve towards the terminal building. It hit two parked British European Airways Hawker Siddeley Trident aircraft, burst into flames and came to rest against the ground floor of the terminal building. Six of the eight crew died, as did eight horses on board. Trident G-ARPT was written off, and Trident G-ARPI was badly damaged, but subsequently repaired, only to be lost in the Staines crash in 1972.|$|E
25|$|Wright led the United States {{troops at}} the Battle of Four Lakes on September 1, {{and was able}} to beat back the tribal forces. The tribes then fought back in the Battle of Spokane Plains, where they set fire to <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> shot at the troops through the smoke; while there was no decisive winner, the tribes were greatly weakened. At this point, the tribes were greatly divided over whether to {{continue}} fighting, as the elder leaders saw little chance of victory. Wright then killed over 800 of the Indians' horses that had been captured throughout the fighting, depriving the tribes of their means to fight and hunt, and showing the extremes that the Army would go to in order to subdue the tribes. The Chiefs of the Coeur d'Alene tribe, who realized {{that they would not be}} able to defeat the Army, especially without the aid of their horses, sent a Coeur d’Alene member to Wright’s camp to present their peace proposal.|$|E

25|$|Although grizzlies are of {{the order}} Carnivora and have the {{digestive}} system of carnivores, they are normally omnivores: their diets consist of both plants and animals. They {{have been known to}} prey on large mammals, when available, such as moose, elk, caribou, white-tailed deer, mule deer, bighorn sheep, bison, and even black bears; though {{they are more likely to}} take calves and injured individuals rather than healthy adults. Grizzly bears feed on fish such as salmon, trout, and bass, and those with access to a more protein-enriched diet in coastal areas potentially grow larger than inland individuals. Grizzly bears also readily scavenge food or carrion left behind by other animals. Grizzly bears will also eat birds and their eggs, and gather in large numbers at fishing sites to feed on spawning salmon. They frequently prey on baby deer left in <b>the</b> <b>grass,</b> <b>and</b> occasionally they raid the nests of raptors such as bald eagles.|$|E
25|$|On lap 44 Timo Glock ran wide onto <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> {{the bottom}} of his car hit two {{substantial}} bumps, the second of which caused it to briefly fly {{up in the air and}} land with force sufficient to break the suspension, leaving the monocoque in contact with the ground and unable to be stopped, resulting in a sizable accident. Glock spun twice and came to rest against the wall further down the track. He was forced to retire and the safety car came out for a third time. On the same lap, due to a false signal from the chief mechanic, Barrichello left a pit stop before the fuel hose had been removed from his car. Several mechanics suffered minor injuries. He would also serve a ten-second penalty for this pit stop as it was taken while the pit lane was closed. Ultimately he was disqualified for exiting the pitlane when the red light was on.|$|E
25|$|This stork shows unique nesting {{behaviours}} {{not observed}} {{in many other}} storks and that may reflect its adaptation to nesting on the ground. For example, {{it is one of}} a minority of stork species to perform a distinct Nest Covering Display to protect nestlings from potential predators. During this display, the nesting stork droops its wings along its sides with a strongly cocked tail and erect feathers on the head and neck; accompanied by a clattering of the bill that is pointed almost vertically downward. Another nesting behaviour apparently unique to the maguari stork is the Mock Resting display. Here, during the presence of an intruder near the nest, the individual stands motionless with its back strongly arched, neck retracted, and wings and bill folded almost vertically downward. This behaviour likely evolved as an adaptation to ground nesting in dense vegetation because the posture maintained by the nesting bird amongst <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> reeds may render it difficult to see by the intruder; and at the same time, the bird is poised ready to attack.|$|E
