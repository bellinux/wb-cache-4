5|$|The {{problems}} of tomb construction {{can be seen}} with tombs of Ramesses III and his father Setnakhte. Setnakhte started to excavate KV11 but broke into the <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> Amenmesse, so construction was abandoned and he instead usurped the <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> Twosret, KV14. When looking for a tomb, Ramesses III extended the partly-excavated tomb started by his father. The <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> Ramesses II returned to an early style, with a bent axis, {{probably due to the}} quality of the rock being excavated (following the Esna shale).|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{powerful}} and influential nobles {{began to be}} buried with the royal family; {{the most famous of}} these tombs is the joint <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> Yuya and Tjuyu, KV46.

5|$|The first {{ruler of}} the dynasty, Setnakhte, {{actually}} had two tombs constructed for himself.

Originally a powerful lich, he has (unbeknownst to the players) become a demi-lich, a more powerful form of undead that has transcended the need for any physical body apart from its skull. Player characters must survive the deadly traps in the tomb and fight their way into the demi-lich's elaborately concealed inner sanctum to destroy him once and for all.|$|E

During the same period, the Caprioli family commissioned the <b>tomb</b> <b>of</b> Luigi Caprioli to be placed within their chapel in the church of San Giorgio, probably together with other sculptures, made probably in collaboration with the Sanmicheli workshop, to which is attributed the marble jamb decorated with candelabras.|$|E

These mortuary temples became places visited during the various festivals held in the Theban necropolis. Most notable is the Beautiful festival of the valley, where the sacred barques of Amun-Re, his consort, Mut, and son, Khonsu, left the temple at Karnak in order to visit the funerary temples of deceased kings on the West Bank and their shrines in the Theban Necropolis.|$|E
