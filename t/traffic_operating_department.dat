25|$|For {{nearly ten}} years after its formation, the LMS had been run using a similar {{organisational}} structure to one of its constituents, the Midland Railway. In practice {{this meant that the}} commercial managers found themselves subservient {{to the needs of the}} <b>operating</b> <b>departments.</b> This changed in 1932 when a major restructuring was completed, replacing the traditional board of directors with an executive headed by a president, supported by vice presidents each with responsibility for a specific area. Ernest Lemon, who had briefly held the office of Chief Mechanical Engineer pending the arrival of William Stanier became Vice President (Railway <b>traffic,</b> <b>operating</b> & commercial), with separate chief operating and chief commercial managers of equal status reporting to him. Railway operations were directed by Charles Byrom, a veteran officer of the LNWR, while commercial activities were headed by Ashton Davies, formerly of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway.|$|R

40|$|AIM: This {{paper is}} a report of a study to {{determine}} the national spread of incidents of disagreement within and between professional groups in <b>operating</b> <b>departments</b> {{and the frequency of}} perceived aggressive behaviour demonstrated by <b>operating</b> <b>department</b> personnel. BACKGROUND: There is both anecdotal and empirical evidence supporting the idea of the operating team as the ultimate example of teamworking in health care. At the same time, international concern is expressed over the level of interprofessional conflict and aggression reported in <b>operating</b> <b>departments.</b> Such reports do not sit well with notions of excellence in teamwork as conceptualized by theorists. METHOD: A questionnaire survey was designed, and sent to a random sample of National Health Service <b>operating</b> <b>departments</b> in England (n = 62) in 2002. Usable survey questionnaires were returned from 37 departments (response rate 59. 6) and yielded 391 individual responses. Respondents included nurses (58...|$|R
50|$|As {{a railway}} executive, {{he is one}} of the leaders of the country. He learned the {{business}} from the Burlington, from which so many able and successful railway managers have been graduated. He has served at different times in the engineering, the accounting, the <b>traffic,</b> and the <b>operating</b> <b>departments</b> and few men know both the theory and the practice of railway operation and management so thoroughly. He is a tireless worker, a master of details, and an excellent organizer. He makes his plans far ahead, and is indomitably persevering in carrying them out. He has had a difficult situation to deal with throughout his career on the Northern Pacific. The road when he took charge of it was not in very good physical condition, and he very greatly improved it. Its mileage was 5,111 miles and he increased it to 6,032 miles. Its revenue freight train load was 326 tons, and he increased it in 1912 to 511 tons. It looked as if the Northern Pacific was hard hit when the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul built its extension to the Puget Sound right through the Northern Pacific territory, and that the Northern Pacific did feel severely for some time the effects of this new competition, but Mr. Elliott sturdily met the issue, fought a good fight, maintained the road's dividend, and at the same time made large expenditures from earnings for improvements. In spite of the adverse conditions he was able to show a surplus of over $3,000,000 in 1911, and one of over $2,000,000 in 1912. When George J. Gould retired as president of the Missouri Pacific in 1911 Mr. Elliott was offered the presidency of that road, but declined it.|$|R

30|$|For {{the most}} part, however, design {{programs}} existed along a continuum between a purely centralized approach, acting as an internal consultancy and providing <b>operating</b> <b>departments</b> with ready-made solutions; and a purely distributed approach, {{in which the}} primary function was to facilitate innovation in <b>operating</b> <b>departments</b> and provide training in design thinking. Thus most of the organizations interviewed for this study fell into the hybrid category, offering both ideation and facilitation/training.|$|R
