500|$|Anderlecht's 3–1 {{victory in}} the first leg meant that Liverpool needed to score two goals to force the tie into extra-time. Despite heavy fog at Anfield, the match went ahead and Liverpool opened the scoring in the 13th minute. A shot by midfielder Jimmy Case was saved by Anderlecht goalkeeper Nico de Bree, but the ball rebounded to Emlyn Hughes who scored to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Following the goal, the Liverpool fans chanted [...] "Oggy, Oggy <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> scored" [...] towards goalkeeper Ogrizovic, as the heavy fog made it {{difficult}} to identify players. Ogrizovic made a number of vital saves to keep Liverpool's hopes alive, saving from François Van der Elst and Rob Rensenbrink.|$|E

Corban Goble of Pitchfork commnted, [...] "It's unfair to deeply scrutinize lyrics on a pop record—the {{goal is to}} write smart, but skew broad—but Emotion fails to <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> <b>who</b> Jepsen is or wants to be." [...] Her [...] "absence of an identity" [...] was further compared to her contemporaries for their image-conscious work. While Adam Downer of cokemachineglow opines that the album's [...] "retro-pop bliss without angle or ego lends it a refreshingly timeless quality", further contexualizing it [...] "a year where pop stars fight for brand supremacy"; Alexis Petridis of The Guardian states that the issue isn't Jepsen being without an [...] "outrageous, headline-grabbing persona" [...] like Rihanna or Miley Cyrus but that [...] "she doesn’t do anything to stamp her identity on the songs [...] It’s one problem that all the expensive names in the credits can’t solve." [...] Similarly, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times scrutinizes the heavy-lifting done by Emotions cast of collaborators: [...] "Maybe Ms. Jepsen’s choices merely reinforce the new centrist pop model of ’80s sleekness but why fall {{under the spell of}} someone else’s cool when you can luxuriate in the stink of your own cheese?" ...|$|E
