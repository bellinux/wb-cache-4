5|$|Some ticks attach quickly {{while others}} wander {{around looking for}} thinner skin such as is found on <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> mammals. Depending on the species and the life stage, {{preparing}} to feed can take from ten minutes to two hours. On locating a suitable feeding spot, the tick grasps the host's skin and cuts into the surface. They extract blood by cutting {{a hole in the}} host's epidermis, into which they insert their hypostome, and keep the blood from clotting by excreting an anticoagulant or platelet aggregation inhibitor.|$|E
5|$|The large frill on Styracosaurus {{and related}} genera {{also may have}} helped to {{increase}} body area to regulate body temperature, like <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> the modern elephant. A similar theory has been proposed regarding the plates of Stegosaurus, although this use alone would {{not account for the}} bizarre and extravagant variation seen in different members of the Ceratopsidae. This observation is highly suggestive of what is now believed to be the primary function, display.|$|E
5|$|After rodents, bats are {{the largest}} order of mammals, making up about 20% of mammal species. There are 1,240 bat species which are {{traditionally}} recognized to belong to two suborders of bats: Megachiroptera (megabats), and the Microchiroptera (microbats/echolocating bats). Not all megabats are larger than microbats. Microbats use echolocation, but megabats do not, {{with the exception of}} the genus Rousettus. Microbats lack the claw at the second finger of the forelimb. <b>The</b> <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> microbats do not close to form a ring; the edges are separated from each other at the base of the ear. Megabats eat fruit, nectar, or pollen. Most microbats eat insects; others may feed on fruit, nectar, pollen, fish, frogs, small mammals, or the blood of animals. Megabats have well-developed visual cortices and good visual acuity, while microbats rely on echolocation for navigation and finding prey.|$|E

5|$|Amphibian skin is {{permeable}} to water. Gas exchange {{can take}} place through the skin (cutaneous respiration) and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising {{to the surface of}} water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds. To compensate for their thin and delicate skin, amphibians have evolved mucous glands, principally on their heads, backs and tails. The secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist. In addition, most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances. Some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect. The main poison-producing glands, the paratoids, produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> toads, along the backs of frogs, behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians.|$|E
5|$|In {{high-duty}} cycle echolocation, bats emit {{a continuous}} call and separate pulse and echo in frequency. <b>The</b> <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> these bats are sharply tuned {{to a specific}} frequency range. They emit calls outside this range to avoid deafening themselves. They then receive echoes back at the finely tuned frequency range {{by taking advantage of}} the Doppler shift of their motion in flight. The Doppler shift of the returning echoes yields information relating to the motion and location of the bat's prey. These bats must deal with changes in the Doppler shift due to changes in their flight speed. They have adapted to change their pulse emission frequency in relation to their flight speed so echoes still return in the optimal hearing range.|$|E
5|$|The {{methods used}} to {{cultivate}} crops are described in Book XVIII. He praises Cato the Elder and his work De Agri Cultura, which he uses as a primary source. Pliny's work includes discussion of all known cultivated crops and vegetables, as well as herbs and remedies derived from them. He describes machines used in cultivation and processing the crops. For example, he describes a simple mechanical reaper that cut <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> wheat and barley without the straw and was pushed by oxen (Book XVIII, chapter 72). It is depicted on a bas-relief found at Trier from the later Roman period. He also describes how grain is ground using a pestle, a hand-mill, or a mill driven by water wheels, as found in Roman water mills across the Empire.|$|E

5|$|The {{plant is}} known for its {{medicinal}} properties and has significant anti-bacterial properties; the leaves and the root have been used to treat bronchitis, cough, earache, wounds and bone fractures by herbalists in countries like Oman. The ground leaves of Tephrosia apollinea are also inhaled to reduce nasal congestion, or boiled with water to make eardrops. Powdered bark can be mixed with water and poured into <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> camels to alleviate ticks, and powdered leaves {{can be used as a}} paste in the treating of wounds. It can also be rubbed on limbs in conjunction with Fagonia indica and Ocomim basilicum to treat people affected with polio.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{indications}} of the colour and skin {{texture of the}} animal because no skin impressions or mummies are known. Most life restorations show the creature's skin as thick, folded, grey, and hairless, based on modern rhinoceroses. Because hair retains body heat, modern large mammals such as elephants and rhinoceroses are largely hairless. American palaeontologist Donald Prothero has proposed that, contrary to most depictions, Paraceratherium had large, elephant-like ears that it used for thermoregulation. <b>The</b> <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> elephants enlarge the body's surface area and are filled with blood vessels, making the dissipation of excess heat easier. According to Prothero, {{this would have been}} true for Paraceratherium; he points to robust bones around the ear openings. The palaeontologists Pierre-Olivier Antoine and Darren Naish have expressed scepticism towards this idea.|$|E
5|$|Tadpoles {{retain the}} lateral line system of their ancestral fishes, {{but this is}} lost in {{terrestrial}} adult amphibians. Some caecilians possess electroreceptors {{that allow them to}} locate objects around them when submerged in water. The ears are well developed in frogs. There is no external ear, but the large circular eardrum lies {{on the surface of the}} head just behind the eye. This vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone, the stapes, to the inner ear. Only high-frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way, but low-frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism. There is a patch of specialized haircells, called papilla amphibiorum, in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds. Another feature, unique to frogs and salamanders, is the columella-operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals. <b>The</b> <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound.|$|E

5|$|The {{decisions}} reached {{during this}} period vary, however, mostly due to the differing judicial philosophies of the time. While A.V. Dicey maintained that the prevalent philosophy was one of laissez faire thanks {{to the influence of}} philosophers and economists such as Adam Smith, Michael W. Flinn asserted that: Another common error... has been the assumption that the classical economists were the only effective influence on social and economic policy in the early and mid-nineteenth century. This is a curiously perverse view, since it ignores powerful voices like those of Bentham, Chadwick, the social novelists, many by no means inarticulate members of the medical profession, the humanitarians, the Christian Socialists and most sections of the many working class movements. There was in short, nothing approaching a consensus of opinion concerning laissez-faire and state intervention, even in the very narrow social sector represented by governments, Parliament, and the press. In practice <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> ministers were assaulted by a confused babble of voices rather than bewitched by the soft whisper of a single plea for inaction.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> river {{dolphins}} have specific adaptations to their aquatic environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In {{river dolphins}}, and other cetaceans, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, river dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allows for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows river dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation. They are so dependent on echolocation that they can survive {{even if they are}} blind. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the Amazon river dolphin are believed to function as a tactile sense, possibly to compensate for their poor eyesight.|$|E
5|$|This emblem was in turn {{replaced}} by a new one in 1950. The central feature of this symbol is a crossed hammer and sickle, a universal Communist symbol symbolizing the unity of workers and peasants. Below this symbol, a sun is shown rising behind a globe. The insignia is framed by ears of wheat, each ear ending in flowers; clover {{on the left and}} flax on the right. A red ribbon is wrapped around <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> wheat, reminiscent of the red flag used by the Communist movement. The base of the emblem shows the letters Ð‘Ð¡Ð¡Ð . The ribbon features the phrase Workers of the World, Unite! The left side inscribed in Belarusian, the right side in Russian. The red star of Communism is featured above the hammer and sickle. The 1950 version was designed by Ivan Dubasov, a People's Artist of the USSR. Article 119 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR defines the design of the emblem.|$|E
