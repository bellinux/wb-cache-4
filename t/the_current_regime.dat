40|$|We model s-wave and d-wave disordered {{granular}} superconductors with {{a three-dimensional}} lattice of randomly distributed Josephson junctions with finite self-inductance. The nonlinear ac resistivity {{of these systems}} was calculated using Langevin dynamical equations. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> amplitude dependence of the nonlinear resistivity at the peak position {{is found to be}} a power law characterized by exponent α. The later is not universal but depends on <b>the</b> self-inductance and <b>current</b> <b>regimes.</b> In <b>the</b> weak <b>current</b> <b>regime</b> α is independent of the self-inductance and equal to 0. 5 or both of s- and d-wave materials.

25|$|Following the {{assassination}} of al-Mutawakkil in December 861, the Maghariba {{played an important role}} during the events of the Anarchy at Samarra (861–870). On the day that al-Muntasir was given the oath of allegiance (bay'ah), the Maghariba were employed as riot troops against residents in the capital who opposed the new caliph. After al-Muntasir's death in 862 they, together with the Turks and Ushrusaniyya, agreed to recognize al-Musta'in as caliph, and they were again used to attack rioters who favored al-Musta'in's rival al-Mu'tazz. In the following year, during a particularly severe riot in Samarra, the Maghariba looted the homes of several civilians; a few months later, having become increasingly dissatisfied with <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>regime,</b> they organized in the capital to voice their agitation, but they ultimately decided to take no action and dispersed.|$|E
25|$|The 1997 {{report of}} the Belgian Senate stated {{that there was not}} enough {{information}} to determine specifics about the assassination. A 1998 report by the National Assembly of France posited two probable explanations. One is that the attack was carried out by groups of Hutu extremists, distressed by the advancement of negotiations with the RPF, the political and military adversary of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>regime,</b> while the other is that it was the responsibility of the RPF, frustrated at the lack of progress in the Arusha Accords. Among the other hypotheses that were examined is one that implicates the French military, although there is no clear motive for a French attack on the Rwandan government. The 1998 French report made no determination between the two dominant theories. A 2000 report by the Organisation of African Unity does not attempt to determine responsibility.|$|E
25|$|Al-Douri is {{the most}} {{high-profile}} Ba'athist official to successfully evade capture after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and was the king of clubs in the infamous most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. Al-Douri continued to lead elements of the Iraqi insurgency such as the Naqshbandi Army against the then-occupation forces and waged an insurgency against <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>regime</b> in Baghdad. Following the execution of Saddam Hussein on 30 December 2006, al-Douri was confirmed as the new leader of the banned Iraqi Ba'ath Party on 3 January 2007. Al-Douri was reportedly killed in action—along with his nine bodyguards—on 17 April 2015 in a large-scale military operation by Shiite militias and Iraqi forces near the Al-Alaas oil fields in Hemreen east of Tikrit. The Shiite militant organization Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq has alleged to have killed him and transported his apparent body to Baghdad to confirm its identity. According to the BBC, Shiite militias claimed to have killed him, but the Iraqi Baath party denies his death, and his death has not been confirmed. A Kurdish news source also reported that Iraq did not have al-Douri's DNA to confirm his death.|$|E

2500|$|In the People's Republic of China, {{the entire}} period between 1839 and 1949 is {{depicted}} as the [...] "Century of Humiliation" [...] a time when racist, greedy and evil foreigners humiliated and rapaciously exploited the Chinese people. Because {{many aspects of the}} Taiping ideology resembled Communism, the Taipings are treated sympathetically by Chinese historians who portrayed as them as prototypical Communists with Hong Xiuquan being depicted as anticipating Mao. In this context, Gordon is vilified in China today as just another foreigner oppressing the Chinese people by crushing the Taiping rebellion. Furthermore, Gordon worked for the Qing dynasty, who were Manchus, which has led many Han to see the entire Qing period between 1644 and 1912 as a long foreign occupation of China. No monuments to Gordon exist in China today, through the British journalist Rob Stallard noted that the modest Gordon would have no doubt wanted it that way. Stallard in a 2008 article argued that Gordon deserves a better reputation in China, arguing that he was largely immune to the racist views so common to Westerners in the 19th century and he always treated the Chinese with respect, maintaining that the memory of [...] "Chinese Gordon" [...] could be a bridge to better Anglo-Chinese understanding. In Sudan, it is the Mahdi who is the hero and Gordon who is the villain. The Canadian historian C. Brad Faught wrote it was [...] "no coincidence" [...] that the Sudan, a place known as a hotbed of fundamentalist Islam produced both the Mahdi and <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>regime</b> of General Omar al-Bashir, which venerates the memory of the Mahdi and which for a time in the 1990s sheltered Osama bin Laden.|$|E
