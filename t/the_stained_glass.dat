5|$|The cloisters were {{restored}} in the 20thcentury, and <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> windows contain {{the images of}} some 130saints. The cloister garth contains a modern sculpture entitled The water of life by Stephen Broadbent. The refectory roof is dated 1939 and was designed by F.H.Crossley.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> in {{the east}} window, dated 1856, was made by William Wailes. The glass in a south window in the chancel of 1909 was made by Morris & Co. The east window in the north aisle, dated 1920 is by Irene Dunlop. <b>The</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> window {{to the left of}} the pulpit was donated by the Greg family of Styal Mill. <b>The</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> in the window at the west end of the north aisle is to the memory of the wife of Edward John Bell, rector from 1870 to 1907, and was made by Clayton and Bell in 1877. The tower holds a ring of six bells, hung for change ringing, five of which were cast in 1787 by Rudhall of Gloucester, and the sixth by Charles and George Mears at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry in 1847.

The parish registers begin in 1629, and the churchwardens' accounts in 1612.|$|E
5|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> {{windows at}} Kirkpatrick Chapel are {{approximately}} twenty lancet windows along the chapel's side aisles that were donated by graduating {{classes at the}} turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (1890–1912). These windows depict their class year and phrases in Ancient Greek and Latin.|$|E
5|$|Since its erection, the {{building}} has undergone significant repair, renovation and conservation, including work on {{the building}} fabric, <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> windows, the mosaic floors in the chancel and sanctuary and conservation of the Children's Chapel.

50|$|The Rhodes Memorial Chapel, {{built in}} 1891. It was built using a {{donation}} from a Ms. Amos Rhodes in a Richardsonian Romanesque style. <b>The</b> <b>stain</b> <b>glass</b> windows are valued at over $10,000.|$|R
5|$|The 17th century saw {{the loss}} {{of many of the}} church {{fittings}} and much of <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> during the Reformation and the English Civil War. During the reign of Queen Anne, and partially funded by her, the interior of St. Mary Redcliffe was refitted in the Baroque style.|$|E
5|$|The south aisle was {{shortened}} {{in about}} 1870 by Scott, and given an apsidal east end, becoming the chapel of St Erasmus. <b>The</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> in the apse window is dated 1872 and is by Clayton and Bell. Below {{this is a}} mosaic designed by J.R.Clayton and made by Salviati, and a fresco painting by Clayton and Bell, dated 1874. Elsewhere <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> in the aisle is by Wailes, and by Hardman & Co. to a design by Pugin.

5|$|There {{is a pair}} {{of windows}} in the west wall {{decorated}} with tracery (stonework within the window frame forming a pattern). Scenes from the Bible and geometric patterns are shown in <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass,</b> and birds (phoenix and peacock) are depicted {{at the top of the}} windows. The glass is dedicated to Rice Robert Hughes, a clergyman who died in 1801. There are three arched windows in the south wall of the nave; <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> of the easternmost (dedicated to William Bulkeley Hughes) shows biblical scenes. The easternmost window of the three in the north wall of the nave is dedicated to Thomas Bulkeley Hughes (who died in 1836), his wife and children. The chancel has one window in the east wall, which has three lights (sections of window separated by stone mullions).|$|E
50|$|The cathedral well {{withstood}} the Japanese {{bombings of}} 1941-42 but the Allied bombing of 14 December 1944 blew all <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glasses</b> to smithereens. They were redone with the ordinary local made glasses.|$|R
50|$|A <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> {{window in}} St. Joseph Church in Sioux City, Iowa {{contains}} {{a portrait of}} Archbishop Hennessy.

50|$|A third {{suggested}} {{theory is}} that the name comes from the Arab word qumariyya or qamariyya. These ones designate <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glasses</b> that can even be glimpsed from the Hall of the Ambassadors' balcony.|$|R
5|$|The chapel was {{thoroughly}} renovated in 1631 by Thomas Lyte, who installed the arch-braced-collar truss roof, the communion rail, a rear screen and a frieze below the roof painted with {{the arms of}} the Lytes and their relations. A monument to the south of the altar records Thomas' work on the chapel. In 1912 Sir Walter Jenner added <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass,</b> including medieval glass said to have come from Charlton Mackrell church which William Le Lyte had commissioned before his death in 1316.|$|E
5|$|A small chapel lies to {{the north}} of the central hall. Originally rather austere, it was lavishly {{decorated}} by Barry in the High Victorian style. There is much elaborate wood carving, with the altar rail featuring angels and the benches poppyheads. The marble apse has alabaster carved heads of the prophets and evangelists by J. Birnie Philip, and the wall panelling features bronze medallions depicting biblical characters by the same artist. The ornate choir gallery, reached from the central hall's mezzanine gallery, contains the family pew. <b>The</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> and wall murals are by Clayton and Bell, and the painting and stencilling are by J. G. Crace.|$|E
5|$|The chapel on {{the upper}} floor became a store room in the early 1980s for pieces being sold off. <b>The</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> window of the chapel, with the Spencer crest, dates to 1588, and was brought to Althorp from Wormleigton. The organ {{on the other hand}} is far more recent, {{acquired}} from the parish of Meriden in the 1990s. A number of earlier occupants of Althorp, particularly George John and Frederick, were devout Christians and would preach in the chapel, and Robert, 6th Earl Spencer would hold a daily service here. It is still used for family christenings, and for services at Christmas, Easter and Harvest Thanksgiving.|$|E
50|$|St. Bartholomew's Church is {{well known}} for its {{beautiful}} marble altar. Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV donated the expenses towards <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glasses</b> and teakwood paneling. In 1930, to mark the centenary celebrations, Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV donated towards a <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> depicting St. Bartholomew, which was unveiled by Lady Wellington.|$|R

5|$|The chapel {{underwent}} a two-year, $10 million restoration between 2000 and 2002. Despite {{the complexity of}} the work, the chapel remained open throughout the restoration. The project earned a New Jersey Historic Preservation Award in 2002, and the stone work won the 2004 Tucker Award for Renovation and Restoration from Stone World magazine. At the time, two experts working on <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> restoration called it the largest such project that had ever been undertaken in the United States; too large for a single studio, it was divided among studios in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and New York.|$|E
5|$|The current church, St Andrew's and St Peter's, {{was built}} in 1832 to a design by William Burn in the Gothic style with buttressed walls and a square tower. The pipe organ was added by Norman & Beard in 1914, and in 1922 Oscar Paterson contributed some of <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> windows such as 'The Sower'. In 2013 gravestones were vandalised in the graveyard. Holburn Head Lighthouse, within the parish territory, was {{completed}} in 1862 to a design by David & Thomas Stevenson and has since achieved Category B listed status.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> {{windows of}} the nave's north and south aisles {{represent}} one aspect of this synthesis. The north windows depict Biblical figures and scenes, while the south windows contain images associated with human knowledge. The lower of these, at the triforium level, depict the teachings of Christ, while the six upper windows at the clerestory level depict influential figures in Philosophy, Theology, Chivalry, Poetry, Law, and Science, as read from east to west. The Science window faces a window due to Willet on the north wall with scenes from Genesis, symbolizing harmony between the Christian story of the Creation and the modern means of understanding it.|$|E

5|$|There {{are five}} large {{stained glass windows}} on the {{northern}} and southern walls and additional windows in the stairwell to the belltower and on the western wall. Most of them are designed by Percy Bacon Brothers and the majority were donated as memorials by parishioners in the period from 1900 to 1910. <b>The</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> fanlight depicting James and John, the sons of Zebedee, was designed by Australian artist Norman Carter in 1930. The window behind the baptismal font, depicting Christ with the Children, was repaired and rededicated in 2004 by the fifteenth rector {{in the presence of the}} then Primate, Peter Carnley.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 300 {{households}} {{were members}} by 2006, {{and in the}} same year, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation awarded the synagogue a grant of $350,000 for exterior restoration of the sanctuary. The grant was part of a million-dollar capital campaign that the membership intended to carry out in 2008, as the synagogue building still required extensive repairs: the roof leaked, causing interior damage, and (along with the gutters) needed to be replaced; interior columns were taped to prevent plaster from falling off them; the sanctuary doors needed to be replaced; and <b>the</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> windows needed to be removed, the metal holding them repaired, and their wooden framing replaced. In 2007 the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites Program awarded Baith Israel Anshei Emes grants totaling $17,500, for copper roof and masonry restoration.|$|E
5|$|The 13th-century Lady Chapel {{contains}} the stone shrine of SaintWerburgh which {{dates from the}} 14thcentury and which used to contain her relics. The shrine, of similar red sandstone as the cathedral, has a base pierced with deep niches. The upper part {{takes the form of}} a miniature chapel containing statuettes. During the dissolution of the monasteries it was dismantled. Some of the parts were found during the 1873 restoration of the cathedral and the shrine was reassembled in 1888 by Blomfield. A carving of StWerburgh by Joseph Pyrz was added in 1993. Also in the chapel are a sedilia and a piscina. <b>The</b> <b>stained</b> <b>glass</b> of 1859, is by William Wailes. The chapel contains a monument to Archdeacon Francis Wrangham, made by Hardman & Co. and dating from 1846. In 1555, George Marsh, Martyr stood trial here accused of heresy.|$|E
