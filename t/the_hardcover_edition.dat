500|$|Doll has {{received}} several positive reviews from English-language critics. About.com's Deb Aoki {{placed it on}} her list of recommended horror manga. According to Aoki, Mihara's stories proved to be haunting, despite not following the traditional model of gory horror stories. While finding Mihara's art well-done, yet [...] "not especially memorable", Patrick King of Animefringe wrote that Mihara's focus on the social effects of the Dolls and their environments greatly contributed to {{the appeal of the}} series. Sequential Tarts Sheena McNeil wrote that Doll examines the relationships between androids and people on [...] "a much more serious and realistic level" [...] than Clamp's Chobits. In follow-up reviews, she wrote that the series conveyed [...] "a sense of reality that is unsettling and the stories are harsh reads—being violent and/or tragic." [...] According to her, Doll simultaneously examines the meaning of humanity and modern-day fears surrounding the possibility of such androids. She also wrote that Mihara's [...] "jaw-dropping beautiful" [...] artwork contrasted well with the characters' misery. Jason Thompson, in , wrote that childbirth and family served as the manga's themes. According to him, Mihara's character designs and artwork complemented the stories nicely. Conversely, Anime News Network's Liann Cooper reviewed <b>the</b> <b>hardcover</b> <b>edition</b> of Doll with mixed feelings: according to her, the stories mostly lacked entertainment value, and had artwork that failed to catch the reader's eye, but she praised the presentation. She concluded that <b>the</b> <b>hardcover</b> <b>edition</b> would only appeal to [...] "avid collectors".|$|E

500|$|The {{stories in}} Scientific Detective Monthly were almost always detective stories, {{but they were}} only {{occasionally}} science fiction, as {{in many cases the}} science appearing in the stories already had practical applications. In the first issue, for example, [...] "The Mystery of the Bulawayo Diamond", by Arthur B. Reeve, mentions unusual science, but the mystery is solved by use of a bolometer to detect a blush on the face of a black girl. [...] The murderer in [...] "The Campus Murder Mystery", by Ralph W. Wilkins, freezes the body to conceal the manner of death; a chemical catalyst and electrical measurements of palm sweat provide the scientific elements in two other stories in the same issue. The only genuine science fiction story in the first issue is [...] "The Perfect Counterfeit" [...] by Captain S.P. Meek, in which a matter duplicator has been used to counterfeit paper money. [...] Van Dine's Philo Vance novel, The Bishop Murder Case, began serialization in the first issue, which probably assisted sales, since <b>the</b> <b>hardcover</b> <b>edition</b> of the novel, which had appeared only a few months previously, had sold well. [...] It was not science fiction, however, and throughout the magazine's run, only one or two stories per issue include elements that would qualify them as science fiction. [...] Mike Ashley, a historian of the field, suggests that Gernsback was more interested in stories about the science of detection than in imaginary science: most of Scientific Detective Monthlys contents were gadget stories, of a kind which Gernsback had been publishing in his other magazines for some time. [...] The cover for the first issue, by Jno Ruger, showed a detective using an electronic device to measure the reactions of a suspect.|$|E
