As the convoy, which consisted of 60 ships and 26 escorts, sailed near Iceland, a wolf pack of Kriegsmarine U-Boats attacked the convoy repeatedly over a four-day period. Some 20 U-boats participated, sinking 12 Allied ships, including , a troop transport <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> with 272 men—more than half of her passengers and crew; three U-boats were lost. Samuel Huntington departed the convoy and arrived at Clyde on 11 February.|$|E
5|$|On August 26 at AT Park, in a 3–0 {{win over}} the Colorado Rockies, Bumgarner pitched his second career {{complete}} game one-hit shutout, which included pitching seven perfect innings to start the game until Justin Morneau reached out on a 1–2 pitch <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> deep right field for a double. In the process, he set a franchise-record sixth career game with ten or more strikeouts and no walks. Bumgarner beat Jorge de la Rosa at AT Park {{for the second time}} that season. Bumgarner was named the NL Pitcher of the Month for August. He went 4–1 with a 1.57 ERA, threw three complete games, and had 56 strikeouts against just three walks.|$|E

5|$|Some {{prominent}} individuals rowed {{while they}} were students at the college. The historian Albert Pollard was Captain of Boats in 1890, having rowed in the boat that was last on the river in 1889. Alwyn Williams (later Bishop of Durham), who was a student from 1906 to 1911, was captain of the Boat Club, as was James Page ("Freddie"), {{who went on to}} become secretary of the Amateur Rowing Association from 1952 to 1972 and a rowing coach for both Oxford and Cambridge Boat Clubs. Maurice Jones (later Principal of St David's College, Lampeter) was a cox, as were Gordon Roe (later Bishop of Huntingdon) and the chemist Frank Greenaway. John Sankey (later Lord Chancellor) rowed in a Torpid boat <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> four places, whilst the boat in which the baritone David Ffrangcon Davies rowed went up five places in Torpids and four in Eights Week. Angus Buchanan, who won the Victoria Cross in 1916 during the First World War, rowed in a college four in 1919, despite having been blinded in 1917. Anton Muttukumaru (later Commander of the Ceylon Army) rowed at bow in a college four.|$|E
5|$|On December 2, Michigan {{defeated}} Syracuse in a ACC-Big Ten Challenge game <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to the wire. After {{blowing a}} 10-point second half lead Michigan needed a three point shot from Albrecht with 31 seconds remaining for the victory. On December 6, Michigan suffered its first home {{loss of the}} season to the New Jersey Institute of Technology by a 72–70 margin, despite a career-high 32 points by Levert. With the loss, Michigan's 30-game home win streak versus unranked opponents was snapped. NJIT shot 11-for-17 on its three-point shots in the game. The team lost its three subsequent games to Eastern Michigan, (#3) Arizona, and SMU. The loss to Eastern Michigan, which is separated from the University of Michigan by a 6-mile stretch of Washtenaw Avenue, ended a Big Ten-high 59-game streak without consecutive losses. Eastern Michigan was led in assists (6) by Michael Talley, son of Michigan Basketball point guard and alum Michael Talley, Jr. The December 9 80–53 loss to #3 ranked Arizona was one point shy of being the largest defeat of the Beilein era. The December 20 SMU game marked the first career start by Ricky Doyle. On December 22, the team snapped its 4-game losing streak with a victory over Coppin State who was coached by Michael Grant, the brother of former Wolverine and Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year Gary Grant. One of the game's big storylines was the first regular season point by Austin Hatch. Doyle's game-high 16 points {{marked the first time}} he led the team in scoring. Michigan won its Big Ten Conference home opener against Illinois in overtime on December 30 on the day it announced Jim Harbaugh would become the new Michigan Wolverines football head coach. Aubrey Dawkins, who had a career total of 15 points entering the game, scored a game-high 20-points.|$|E

25|$|Chimborazo then erupted {{several times}} during the Holocene, the last time around 550 AD ± 150years. The eruptions after the {{collapse}} were primarily andesitic, or blocky, coagulated lava flow. These eruptions produced pyroclastic surges <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> as far as 3800 meters altitude. There has been at least 7 eruptions in the past 10000 years. Chimborazo is officially considered inactive, but studies show that there might be an eruption in the future.

25|$|In the 12th {{inning of}} Game 6 of the 1975 World Series at Fenway Park, Fisk hit a pitch off of Cincinnati Reds pitcher Pat Darcy <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> the left field line and {{appeared}} to be heading into foul territory. The image of Fisk jumping and waving the ball fair {{as he made his way}} to first base is considered by many to be one of baseball's greatest moments. The ball struck the foul pole, giving the Red Sox a 7–6 win and forcing a seventh and deciding game of the Fall Classic.|$|E
25|$|To {{commemorate the}} last all-star game at Yankee Stadium, every living {{member of the}} Baseball Hall of Fame was invited to the game.

During the pre-game ceremonies, the Hall of Famers were introduced and assumed their playing position on the field. Instead of announcing the league lineups separately and in batting order, as is usually done, both teams' starters were introduced simultaneously by position, and the players stood in position next to the Hall of Fame members on the field.|$|E

25|$|DeLoach was {{contacted}} by the Director of Naval Research, RADM Jay Cohen, to help search for the USS Alligator <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> in a storm {{off the coast of}} North Carolina in 1863, close to where the USS Monitor went down. Using a variety of remote sensing instruments, researchers from NOAA, the Office of Naval Research, and East Carolina University conducted the first comprehensive hunt for lost Civil War vessel. The USS Alligator was the first submarine built during the Civil War by the Union Navy. The Navy wanted such a vessel to counter the threat posed to its wooden-hulled blockaders by the former screw frigate Merrimack which, according to intelligence reports, the Norfolk Navy Yard was rebuilding as an ironclad ram for the Confederacy (the CSS Virginia). The search's main objective in locating the vessel is to educate the Submarine Force and Navy in general that their undersea heritage actually started back in the Civil War era.|$|E
25|$|As {{the tournament}} moved to Sharjah, Zalmi's first game against Quetta Gladiators was {{abandoned}} after repeated showers {{and the two}} teams shared the points from the bout. Following this, against Islamabad United, the Zalmis lost a hard-fought game <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> to the last ball. After being put in to bat by United, Zalmi could only manage a below-par score of 137 and never really got going. But the team's bowlers bowled exceedingly well to make a contest out of it. In their {{final game of the}} Sharjah leg, the Zalmis continued their losing streak after being beaten by Karachi Kings in a thrilling contest. Setting up a target of 175, the Kings had the Zalmis reduced to 69–6 before Shahid Afridi and Darren Sammy combined in a 70-run partnership that almost won the game for the Zalmis. However, they couldn't see the game through as the Zalmis fell short by 9 runs.|$|E
25|$|On 9 December 2014, {{police in}} Stockholm raided the company's {{premises}} and seized servers and other computers and equipment, {{which resulted in}} the website going offline. The raid was in response to a complaint from Rights Alliance, a Swedish anti-piracy group. The Pirate Bay was one of many peer-to-peer and torrent-related websites and apps <b>that</b> <b>went</b> <b>down.</b> One member of the crew was arrested. TorrentFreak reported that most other torrent sites reported a 5–10% increase in traffic from the displaced users, though the shutdown had little effect on overall piracy levels. In retaliation to the raid, a group of hackers claiming to be part of Anonymous allegedly leaked email log-in details of Swedish government officials. The Pirate Bay co-founder Peter Sunde commented in a blog post that he was happy to see the website shut down, believing his successors have done nothing to improve the site, criticising in particular the increased use of advertisements. IsoHunt has since copied much of the original TPB database and made it accessible through oldpiratebay.org, a searchable index of old Pirate Bay torrents. IsoHunt also released a tool called The Open Bay, to allow users to deploy their own version of the Pirate Bay website. The tool is responsible for around 372 mirror sites. Since 17 December 2014, The Pirate Bay's Facebook page has been unavailable. On 22 December 2014, a website was resumed at the domain thepiratebay.se, showing a flip clock with the length of time in days and hours that the site had been offline, and a waving pirate flag. From this day TPB was hosted for a period in Moldova, on Trabia Network (Moldo-German company) servers. The Pirate Bay then began using the services of CloudFlare, a company which offers reverse proxy services. On 1 January 2015, the website presented a countdown to 1 February 2015. The website returned with a prominent phoenix logo displayed at the domain thepiratebay.se on 31 January 2015.|$|E
