40|$|Studies {{to define}} the optimum {{turbopump}} configurations for the Space Shuttle propulsion system are reported. For each propellant, two turbopumps - one low-pressure and one high-pressure - are needed to generate the high discharge pressures required for engine operation. The optimization of the four pumps resulted {{in the selection of}} an axial inducer type for both low-pressure pumps and in a three-stage centrifugal pump for the high-pressure hydrogen turbopump; meanwhile the oxygen pump features a double inlet main impeller. This impeller feeds the thrust chamber injector, as well as a preburner pump, which boosts the main impeller discharge pressure to the required preburner pressure. The interaction between engine performance and obtainable turbopump performance is discussed, and the reasons for the final selection of the <b>turbine</b> and <b>pump</b> <b>types</b> are presented...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The past years, {{improvement}} of fish survival at hydropower dams {{has shifted from}} development of fish guidance systems towards the development of ‘fish-friendly’ turbines. A variety of technical features of turbines is altered {{in order to reduce}} mortality of fish passing the turbine. Data on mortality rates at traditional, currently applied <b>turbine</b> <b>types,</b> shows a great variation for fish species and life stages. ‘Improvements’ applied in novel <b>turbine</b> <b>types</b> must thus be tested thoroughly, both in small-scale (laboratory) flume test as well as under real-time field condition, before any conclusion can be drawn for long term application. The current question is, how to test the fish-friendliness of a turbine, such that water authorities, regulators, permitting authorities, etc, will accept a ‘minimum’ (?) of fish mortality. A variety of new <b>turbine</b> <b>types</b> as well as turbine test facilities are under development. Any statement on {{improvement of}} fish survival requires certification on this matter. For this, there is a strong need of a protocol to test the ‘fish friendliness’ independently. As it will take many years before new <b>turbine</b> <b>types</b> have long-term data on fish mortality, test protocols must be designed to provide the best possible representativeness...|$|R

40|$|Design for {{maintenance}} {{has the potential}} to significantly reduce the cost of offshore wind energy. This paper shows the results of an O&M cost and availability analysis when different design {{for maintenance}} techniques are applied to wind turbines. The design for maintenance techniques considered, reduce repair times and the need for jack up vessels as well as introducing redundancy to the power train of the wind turbines. A detailed lifetime O&M cost and availability model is used in this analysis and populated with empirical operational and cost data from a population of ~ 350 offshore wind turbines from between 5 and 10 offshore wind farms throughout Europe. A base line availability and O&M cost per MWh are obtained from the model and input data, these inputs are then adjusted based on different design for maintenance techniques. The subsequent outputs from the model using the adjusted inputs allow for the quantification of O&M savings and availability improvements for the different design for maintenance techniques. These design for maintenance techniques may have different effects on different wind <b>turbine</b> <b>types.</b> As a means of investigating this, a comparison of the O&M saving and availability improvements will be carried out for both a DFIG <b>turbine</b> <b>type</b> and a PMG FRC <b>turbine</b> <b>type.</b> For a hypothetical site located 50 km offshore using a verified O&M model and empirical operational and cost data this paper shows that the overall combination of these improvements reduces the total O&M cost by ~ 16 % for the DFIG and ~ 17 % for the PMG FRC. It also shows that in both <b>turbine</b> <b>types</b> the largest reduction in O&M costs are seen to come from the elimination of the need for heavy lifting vessels...|$|R

40|$|Rock {{grouting}} {{is performed}} {{to decrease the}} hydraulic conductivity around underground structures, such as tunnels and caverns. Cement grouts are often used and pumped into joint and fractures of the rock formation. Piston <b>type</b> <b>pumps</b> are mostly used for high pressure rock grouting. A pulsation effect is inevitable when using this <b>type</b> of <b>pump</b> due to {{the movement of the}} piston. The effect of this pulsation on rock grouting is yet to be known but believed to be benefi-cial for the penetration of the grout. Current flow meters used in the field are not accu-rate enough to determine the fluctuation of the flow rate when it is less than 1 l/min. In addition, currently available flow meters measure the average of the flow over a cer-tain period of time, hence the true fluctuation of the flow rate due to the pulsation of the piston remains unknown. In this paper, a new methodology, the so called ‘Ultrasound Velocity Profiling – Pressure Difference’ (UVP+PD) method has been introduced to show the pulsation effect when using a piston <b>type</b> <b>pump.</b> The feasibility of this method was successfully investigated for the direct in-line determination of the rheological properties of micro cement based grouts under field conditions (Rahman & Håkansson, 2011). Subse-quently, it was also found that this method can be very efficient to measure the fluctu-ation of the flow rate for different <b>types</b> of <b>pumps.</b> From a grouting point of view the UVP+PD method can be used to synchronize the pressure and flow of a piston <b>type</b> <b>pump</b> by measuring the pulsation effect.
