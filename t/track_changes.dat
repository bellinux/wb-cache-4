5|$|Giant otter muzzles {{are short}} and sloping {{and give the}} head a ball-shaped appearance. The ears are small and rounded. The nose (or rhinarium) is {{completely}} covered in fur, with only the two slit-like nostrils visible. The giant otter's highly sensitive whiskers (vibrissae) allow the animal to <b>track</b> <b>changes</b> in water pressure and currents, which aids in detecting prey. The legs are short and stubby and end in large webbed feet tipped with sharp claws. Well suited for an aquatic life, it can close its ears and nose while underwater.|$|E

40|$|The College Adjustment Scales (CAS) are {{a multidimensional}} {{psychological}} measure {{designed specifically for}} use in college and university settings. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the ability of the College Adjustment Scales (CAS) to function as outcome measures in university counseling centers. Study 1 assessed the ability of the CAS to <b>track</b> <b>change</b> following brief therapy using a nonequivalent control group design. Study 2 assessed the convergent validity of the CAS by correlating two of the nine CAS scales with two established measures. The results of a three-factor MANOV A revealed that the CAS were able to <b>track</b> <b>change</b> very well for undergraduate students. Results for graduate students showed that three of the CAS scales <b>tracked</b> <b>change</b> quite well, two scales did not <b>track</b> <b>change,</b> and four scales did not <b>track</b> <b>change</b> for graduate males. Convergent validity results were mixed for the two scales assessed. The Self-Esteem scale was determined to be a fairly good measure of global self-esteem. The CAS Anxiety scale did not correlate well with an instrument that is a good measure of anxiety characterized by physiological symptoms. Recommendations for future research are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Swelling of {{a volcano}} signals that magma has {{accumulated}} near the surface. Scientists monitoring an active volcano will often measure {{the tilt of}} the slope and <b>track</b> <b>changes</b> {{in the rate of}} swelling. An increased rate of swelling, especially if accompanied by an increase in sulfur dioxide emissions and harmonic tremors is a high probability sign of an impending event. The deformation of Mount St. Helens prior to the May 18, 1980 eruption was a classic example of deformation, as {{the north side of the}} volcano was bulging upwards as magma was building up underneath. Most cases of ground deformation are usually detectable only by sophisticated equipment used by scientists, but they can still predict future eruptions this way.|$|E
25|$|Arterial ultrasound, {{especially}} of the carotid arteries, with measurement of {{the thickness of the}} artery wall, offers a way to partially track the disease progression. As of 2006, the thickness, commonly referred to as IMT for intimal-medial thickness, is not measured clinically though it has been used by some researchers since the mid-1990s to <b>track</b> <b>changes</b> in arterial walls. Traditionally, clinical carotid ultrasounds have only estimated the degree of blood lumen restriction, stenosis, a result of very advanced disease. The National Institute of Health did a five-year $5 million study, headed by medical researcher Kenneth Ouriel, to study intravascular ultrasound techniques regarding atherosclerotic plaque. More progressive clinicians have begun using IMT measurement as a way to quantify and track disease progression or stability within individual patients.|$|E
500|$|A fission-fusion {{society is}} a society that changes {{frequently}} in its size and composition, making up a permanent social group called the [...] "parent group". Permanent social networks consist of all individual members of a community and often varies to <b>track</b> <b>changes</b> in their environment. In a fission–fusion society, the main parent group can fracture (fission) into smaller stable subgroups or individuals to adapt to environmental or social circumstances. For example, a number of males may break off from the main group in order to hunt or forage for food during the day, but at night they may return to join (fusion) the primary group to share food and partake in other activities. Many mammals exhibit this, such as primates (for example orangutans and spider monkeys), elephants, spotted hyenas, lions, and dolphins.|$|E

500|$|In 1930, Warren {{became an}} Associate Professor of Medicine. That year he {{published}} [...] "A Roentgenologic Study of the Breast". X-ray imaging {{of the breast}} had first been investigated by Albert Salomon at the University of Berlin in 1913. He produced images of over 3,000 mastectomy specimens, and observed different forms and stages of cancer. He was even able to detect an undiagnosed cancer in a breast that had been removed because of a large cyst. However, Salomon apparently did not appreciate the life saving potential of his observations. Warren used radiology to <b>track</b> <b>changes</b> in breast tissue {{as a result of}} pregnancy and mastitis. He developed a stereoscopic technique, using patients rather than specimens and adapting general purpose X-ray equipment to his needs. His method involved having the patient lie on her side with one arm raised while being X-rayed. In 119 women who subsequently underwent surgery, he correctly found breast cancer in 54 out of 58 cases. This represented a leap forward, as it made diagnosis of breast cancer possible without surgery. It also sparked intense interest in the technique around the world. Today mammography saves thousands of lives.|$|E

2500|$|Temporal {{changes in}} the spatial {{distribution}} of the mass balance result primarily from changes in accumulation and melt along the surface. As a consequence, variations in the mass of glaciers reflect changes in climate and the energy fluxes at the Earth's surface. [...] The Swiss glaciers Gries in the central Alps and Silvretta in the eastern Alps, have been measured for many years. The distribution of seasonal accumulation and ablation rates are measured in-situ. Traditional field methods are combined with remote sensing techniques to <b>track</b> <b>changes</b> in mass, geometry and the flow behaviour of the two glaciers. These investigations contribute to the Swiss Glacier Monitoring Network and the International network of the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS).|$|E
