5|$|On one {{occasion}} {{while he was}} bathing in the Saigon River, Nao decided to inspect the sewer tunnel which his father had advised him to use. Nao concluded that the tunnel would provide the best way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the American area, but using it also presented challenges. The sewerage tunnel contained both wastes and toxic oils which could cause blindness, so Nao and his men would have to close their eyes as they move through the tunnel, {{in order to avoid}} blindness. Furthermore, Nao and his men must wash their bodies {{to get rid of the}} deadly odours to avoid detection, and probably arrest, by South Vietnamese authorities. After Nao had surveyed the tunnels which lead into the port, he presented his plan of attack to the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters. Nao decided to utilise high explosives, enough to sink a ship, and detonate it using a timer so that his men could get away safely. Nao’s superiors approved the plan, and they ordered him to launch the attack before sunrise to avoid killing local Vietnamese civilians.|$|E

25|$|The {{major problem}} of housing {{inequality}} {{is about the}} connection of urban area and downtown city. Transportation plays {{a big role in}} the topic. If public transportation is fully developed and constructed between urban and the downtown city, People are allowed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the city easier, no matter about commuting or retrieving resources. The level of inequality should be less.|$|E

50|$|A pool is also {{located within}} Chastain Park.

25|$|Bell diving bailout options: For bell dives {{there is}} no {{requirement}} for decompression gas, as the bell itself carries bailout gas. However at extreme depths the diver will use gas fast, {{and there have been}} cases where twin 10 litre 300 bar sets were required to supply sufficient gas. Another option which has been used for extreme depth is a rebreather bailout set. A limitation for this service is that the diver must be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the bell while wearing the bailout equipment.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before his}} accident, Reeve played a paralyzed {{police officer in}} the HBO special Above Suspicion. He did {{research}} at a rehabilitation hospital in Van Nuys and learned {{how to use a}} wheelchair <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of cars. Reeve was then offered the lead in Kidnapped, to be shot in Ireland. He was excited to be going to Ireland, and he and Dana decided that they would conceive their second child there. Reeve also planned to direct his first big screen film, a romantic comedy entitled Tell Me True. Not long after making these plans, the family went to Culpeper, Virginia, for an equestrian competition.|$|E
25|$|History {{indicates}} that Policarpa {{was not involved}} in politics before 1810, but by the time she moved back to Bogotá in 1817, she was actively participating in political issues. Because Bogotá was the stronghold of the Reconquista, where most of the population were Spanish Royalists and approved of the take over by Pablo Morillo, it was very difficult <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the city. Policarpa and her brother Bibiano entered the capital with forged documents and safeguards, and a letter of introduction written by Ambrosio Almeyda and José Rodríguez, two Revolutionary leaders; they recommended she and her brother stay in the house of Andrea Ricaurte y Lozano under cover of working as her servants. In reality Andrea Ricaurte's home was the centre of intelligence gathering and resistance in the capital.|$|E

25|$|The initial {{production}} model was the F-94A, which entered operational service in May 1950. Its armament was four 0.50in (12.7mm) M3 Browning machine guns {{mounted in the}} fuselage with the muzzles exiting just behind the radome. Two 165US Gallon (1,204 litre) drop tanks, as carried by the F-80 and T-33, could be carried beneath the wingtips. Alternatively, these could be replaced by 1,000lb (454kg) bombs, giving the aircraft a secondary fighter bomber role. 109 were produced. The F-94A was in operational service for only a brief time as it was originally built, and was not received well by its aircrews. Primarily, {{this was due to}} the unreliability of its J33 engine, which caused many ground aborts and was deemed by the crews to be unsafe. The aircraft was judged as unstable and hard to maneuver at high altitude by its pilots. The pilot and radar operator found that the cockpit was too narrow for them to be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of the aircraft quickly during alerts and scrambles. The clearance for the ejection seats was too small, resulting in several tragic accidents during emergency ejections.|$|E
500|$|With Sinclair's new {{specifications}} in hand, Ogle {{worked on}} a three-wheeled design dubbed the C5, which bore similarities with the earlier three-wheeled Bond Bug – another Ogle design. The vehicle's handlebar steering {{was the brainchild of}} Wood Rogers, who decided at the outset that a steering wheel would not be practicable as it would make it impossible for a driver <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> easily – a serious safety disadvantage. He comments that [...] "putting the bars at the driver's sides made it easy to steer and felt very natural". A prototype was presented to 63 families in the A, B, C1 and C2 demographic groups in suburban and town environments to determine that the controls were correctly positioned; this was the only external research carried out on the C5. In the autumn of 1983, Wills brought in Lotus Cars to finish the vehicle's detailing, build prototypes and test rigs, carry out testing and take forward the programme to production. The development of the C5 took place over 19 months in conditions of great secrecy, with testing carried out at the Motor Industry Research Association's proving ground in Leicestershire.|$|E

2500|$|The {{television}} series The Dukes of Hazzard (1979–1985) featured an orange 1969 Dodge Charger that was named The General Lee. [...] "The General" [...] sported the Confederate battle flag {{painted on the}} roof and the words [...] "GENERAL LEE" [...] over each door.

2500|$|The {{film was}} well-received critically. It {{currently}} has {{a rating of}} 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 16 reviews. In David Ansen's review for Newsweek magazine, he wrote that the film [...] "works equally as a love story, a baseball fable and a comedy, while ignoring the clichés of each genre". Vincent Canby praised Shelton's direction in his review for The New York Times; [...] "he demonstrates the sort of expert comic timing and control that allow him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of situations so quickly that they're over before one has time to question them. Part of the fun in watching Bull Durham is in the awareness that a clearly seen vision is being realized. This is one first-rate debut".|$|E

In 2001, Symoné auditioned for a role on an upcoming series for the Disney Channel titled Absolutely Psychic, about a teenager with psychic abilities. She actually auditioned for the recurring role of Chelsea Daniels, but her role was changed to the lead character Raven Baxter and the series name changed to That's So Raven. The series debuted on January 17, 2003 and ended on November 10, 2007, becoming responsible for many firsts for Disney Channel including becoming the channel's highest-rated and longest-running series at 100 episodes (until it was surpassed by Wizards of Waverly Place in October 2011). The title character draws on her talent, ingenuity, psychic powers {{and a variety of}} disguises <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>out</b> of amusing adolescent and pre-adolescent situations. It spawned a franchise including soundtracks, dolls, episode DVDs, and video games. That's So Raven was nominated for Outstanding Children's Program during the 2005 and 2007 Emmy Awards. That's So Raven, was the first Disney Channel series to have four seasons and 100 episodes. Merchandise has earned to date $400 million.
