5|$|Nora Chadwick (1950) {{suggested}} that mythical legends of Þorgerðr and Irpa have become confused and intertwined with historical accounts of Haakon’s wife Þóra and her sister, Guðrún; and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> of the shieldmaiden Lagertha in the Gesta {{may also be}} an aspect of Þorgerðr. Lotte Motz (1993) proposed that Þorgerðr was a rare instance of a giantess who was the recipient of cultic worship {{in her own right}} in heathen Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson theorizes {{that the}} events in Völuspá {{occurring}} {{after the death of}} the gods (the sun turning black, steam rising, flames touching the heavens, etc.) may be inspired by the volcanic eruptions on Iceland. Records of eruptions on Iceland bear strong similarities to the sequence of events described in Völuspá, especially the eruption at Laki that occurred in 1783. Bertha Phillpotts theorizes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> of Surtr was inspired by Icelandic eruptions, and that he was a volcano demon. Surtr's name occurs in some Icelandic place names, among them the lava tube caves Surtshellir, a number of dark caverns in the volcanic central region of Iceland.|$|E

About 12,500Japanese soldiers participated in the campaign and about 5,500are believed to have been killed. Some sources indicate a possibly higher toll. With only 4,300 Japanese reaching Sio {{at the end of the}} campaign, it is possible <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>figure</b> is closer to 7,000 or 8,000. A significant amount of war materiel was also lost {{during the campaign}}. Of the 26 field artillery pieces that the Japanese possessed in the region, 18 were captured by the Australians during the campaign, while 28 out of their 36 heavy machine-guns were also lost.|$|E

Overall expenses related to the spill were estimated to be $257 million in an earnings report for Plains All American Pipeline issued around the same time. This included the emergency response and cleanup efforts along with the expected legal claims and potential settlements.
