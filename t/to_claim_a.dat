5|$|As {{part of its}} 1996 Pepsi Stuff {{marketing}} campaign, Pepsi ran {{an advertisement}} promising a Harrier jet to anyone who collected 7,000,000 Pepsi Points, a gag that backfired when a participant attempted {{to take advantage of}} the ability to buy additional points for 10 cents each <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>a</b> jet for US$700,000. When Pepsi turned him down, a lawsuit ensued, in which the judge ruled that any reasonable person would conclude that the advertisement was a joke.|$|E
5|$|Booth had a low key {{season in}} 195556, {{struggling}} to find a regular position in the New South Wales team. As there were no international matches during the summer, the Test players were available for the whole campaign. He played in six matches and had few opportunities, managing only 157 runs at 31.40, passing fifty on only one occasion. New South Wales went on <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>a</b> hat-trick of Sheffield Shield titles.|$|E
5|$|Both Helen Douglas and Richard Nixon entered electoral {{politics}} in the mid-1940s. Douglas, a New Deal Democrat, was a former actress and opera singer, and the wife of actor Melvyn Douglas. She represented the 14th congressional district beginning in 1945. Nixon {{grew up in a}} working-class family in Whittier. In 1946, he defeated 12th district Congressman Jerry Voorhis <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>a</b> seat in the United States House of Representatives, where he became known for his anticommunist activities, including his involvement in the Alger Hiss affair.|$|E

However, physicians are absolved of liability if patients refuse treatment for terminal illnesses by issuing advance medical directives.|$|E
5|$|John {{was the son}} of the {{distinguished}} protostrator Alexios Axouch. The Axouchoi were a prominent family of Turkish origin, which was closely associated with the Komnenian dynasty and provided a number of distinguished generals. The two families also intermarried: John's mother Maria was the daughter of Alexios Komnenos, eldest son and co-emperor of Emperor John II Komnenos (r. 1118–1143). John was thus able <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>a</b> pedigree comparable, if not superior, to the reigning Angeloi, albeit from the maternal side.|$|E
5|$|Larger boats {{entering}} Padstow {{were offered}} assistance, generally by pilots who would wait at Stepper Point when a ship signalled {{it would be}} entering. If a boat was foundering, salvors would step in and help. There were cases where salvors attempted to overstate the danger in court, so as to extort more money from the owners. This happened to the brig The Towan, which foundered in October 1843 but was not in significant danger. Although it did not need assistance, salvors interfered and attempted <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>a</b> large amount in compensation from the owner.|$|E

5|$|The Stuarts {{used their}} {{connection}} with Fleance and {{his marriage to}} the Welsh princess <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>a</b> genealogical link with the legendary King Arthur. This, they hoped, would strengthen the legitimacy of their claim to the throne. In 1722, however, Richard Hay, a Scottish historian, presented strong evidence {{that not only was}} James not a descendant of Fleance, but also that neither Fleance nor Banquo ever even existed. Most modern scholars now agree that Fleance is not a real historical figure.|$|E
5|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of the music used was British. The team worked next door {{to the office of the}} musical director for the closing ceremony, David Arnold, and so hearing each other's music there was a scramble <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>a</b> particular song first. A.R. Rahman, who worked with Boyle on Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours, composed a Punjabi song 'Nimma Nimma' to showcase Indian influence in the UK, according to Boyle's wishes. More Indian music was also scheduled for inclusion in the medley. Paul McCartney was to be the ceremony's closing act.|$|E
5|$|The second rule of privity, that a {{third party}} cannot claim {{benefits}} from a contract, was widely criticised by academics, members of the judiciary and legal professionals. One {{problem was that the}} rule made no exceptions for cases where it was obviously intended for the third party <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>a</b> benefit, such as in Beswick v Beswick, where an uncle gave his nephew a business, on the condition that the nephew would pay the uncle a certain amount per week, and in the event of the uncle's death, give a similar amount to his widow.|$|E

5|$|According to Skeat {{the note}} in the codex {{indicated}} that the manuscript had not previously been in the Patriarchal Library in Alexandria. The manuscript was carried from Constantinople to Alexandria between 1308 and 1316, together with two mentioned above manuscripts of Chrysostom. It remained in Alexandria until 1621, when Cyril removed it once to Constantinople. Whether was originally written, in Constantinople or in Alexandria, is another question. Skeat {{did not try to}} give the answer on this question ("if any future scholar wisches <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>a</b> Constantinopolitan origin for the Codex Alexandrinus, it is at least open to him to do so"). This view was supported by McKendrick, who proposes Ephesian provenance of the codex.|$|E
5|$|Australia had {{proceeded}} {{through the}} first two months of their tour of England undefeated. After winning 10 of the first 12 gamesthe other two being drawneight of these by an innings, they won the First Test by eight wickets.

They crushed England by 409 runs in the Second Test at Lord's, Abefore defeating Surrey by ten wickets and crushing Gloucestershire by an innings and 363 runs, after amassing 774/7 declared, their highest score of the season. The Third Test was drawn amid rain interruptions that cost {{a day and a half}} of play; England had been in a strong position, having been 316 runs ahead with seven wickets in hand in their second innings when rain came at the end of the third day. Australia proceeded <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>a</b> ten-wicket triumph over Middlesex in their only county game before the Fourth Test.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{launched}} two legal actions {{while in}} prison {{to secure a}} share of the estate, which the cousins said was part of an attempt to harass and vilify them. In 2003 he began a High Court action to recover £1.2m from the estate of his adoptive grandmother, arguing that he should have inherited her home at Carbonnells Farm, Wix, Essex, which went instead to June's sister—the grandmother had cut Bamber out of her will when he was arrested—and that he was owed 17 years' rent from his cousins who lived there. In 2004 he went to the High Court again <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>a</b> £326,000 share of the profit from the caravan site. The court ruled against him.|$|E

5|$|Bats {{employ a}} number of {{reproductive}} strategies. Most species are polygynous, where males mate with multiple females. Male pipistrelle, noctule and vampire bats may claim and defend resources that attract females, such as roost sites, and mate with those females. Males that are unable <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>a</b> site are forced {{to live on the}} periphery where they have less reproductive success. Promiscuity, where both sexes mate with multiple partners, exists in species like the Mexican free-tailed bat and the little brown bat. Nevertheless, there does appear to be bias towards certain males among females in these bats. In a few species, such as the yellow-winged bat and spectral bat, adult males and females form monogamous pairs. Lek mating, where males aggregate and compete for female choice though display, is rare in bats but notably occurs in the highly sexually dimorphic hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus).|$|E

Part III outlines the problems that have arisen because we no longer require claiming. And Part IV contextualizes and discusses my proposal to incentivize copyright holders <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> their works and to reinvigorate the innocent infringer defense...|$|R

5|$|Of its varsity sports, Texas Tech's women's {{basketball}} {{team has been}} the only one <b>to</b> <b>claim</b> <b>a</b> national title.
