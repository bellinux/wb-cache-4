5|$|An earlier canal {{had been}} built in the Middle Ages to supply Glastonbury Abbey and the town with stone and produce. In the early 19th century a new canal was {{proposed}} to improve commerce in Glastonbury and help with drainage of the surrounding area of the Somerset Levels. Several alternative routes were considered and costed before obtaining an Act of Parliament and issuing a prospectus to raise funds for the building of the canal. Construction commenced in the 1820s; however it was more expensive than envisaged and further funds had to be raised. It finally opened in 1833 but was only prosperous for a short period. The shortfall in income and engineering problems with water supply and waterlogged peat causing the clay puddling <b>to</b> <b>fracture</b> meant that it was sold to the Bristol and Exeter Railway. They used the canal to transport materials for the construction of the new Somerset Central Railway which opened in 1854.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpsons's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. As the race closed in on the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began <b>to</b> <b>fracture,</b> and for a while, Simpson managed {{to stay in the}} front group of elite riders. He then slipped back to a group of chasers around one minute behind before he began to lose control of his bike and zig-zag across the road. His team manager, Alec Taylor, feared for Simpson less for the way he was going up the mountain than for the way he would go down the other side.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} it was not {{mandatory}} to flight test new variants of existing engines, and certification testing failed to reveal vibration modes that the fan experienced during the regularly performed power climbs at high altitude. Analysis revealed that the fan was being subjected to high-cycle fatigue stresses worse than expected and also more severe than tested for certification; these higher stresses caused the blade <b>to</b> <b>fracture.</b> Less than a month after grounding, the fleet was allowed to resume operations once the fan blades and fan disc were replaced and the electronic engine controls were modified to reduce maximum engine thrust to 22,000lbf (98kN) from 23,500lbf (105kN). The redesigned fan blades were installed on all CFM56-3C1 and CFM56-3B2 engines, including over 1,800 engines that had already been delivered to customers.|$|E

5|$|In 1796 British Royal Navy {{dominance}} in the East Indies during the French Revolutionary Wars was challenged {{by the arrival of}} a squadron of six French Navy frigates, commanded by Contre-amiral Pierre César Charles de Sercey. Among these ships was the new 40-gun frigate Preneuse, commanded by Captain Jean-Matthieu-Adrien Lhermitte. Preneuse had not sailed from France with Sercey, instead passing independently through the Atlantic and uniting with the squadron at Port Louis on Île de France. Sercey deployed his squadron to the Dutch East Indies, but suffered frustration at the Action of 9 September 1796 and the Bali Strait Incident of January 1797 and subsequently returned to the base at Port Louis. There the squadron began <b>to</b> <b>fracture,</b> with a succession of ships sent back to France or detached on independent missions.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the upcoming twentieth anniversary of his reign on November 20, 303, Diocletian declared a general amnesty in a third edict. Any imprisoned clergyman could now be freed, {{so long as he}} agreed to make a sacrifice to the gods. Diocletian may have been searching for some good publicity with this legislation. He may also have sought <b>to</b> <b>fracture</b> the Christian community by publicizing the fact that its clergy had apostatized. The demand to sacrifice was unacceptable to many of the imprisoned, but wardens often managed to obtain at least nominal compliance. Some of the clergy sacrificed willingly; others did so on pain of torture. Wardens were eager to be rid of the clergy in their midst. Eusebius, in his Martyrs of Palestine, records the case of a clergy who, after being brought to an altar, had his hands seized and made to complete a sacrificial offering. The clergyman was told that his act of sacrifice had been recognized and was summarily dismissed. Others were told they had sacrificed even when they had done nothing.|$|E
5|$|Production of the German Leopard 2 {{and the new}} 120mm {{tank gun}} began in 1979, {{fulfilling}} an order for the German Army. Although the American M1 Abrams was originally armed with the M68A1 105mm gun (a version of the L7), the United States Army had planned to fit the tank with a larger main gun at a later date, and the tank's turret had been designed to accommodate a larger 120mm gun. The larger gun was integrated into the M1A1 Abrams, with the first vehicle coming off the production line in 1985 The gun, known as the M256, {{was based on the}} L/44 tank gun, although manufactured at Watervliet Arsenal and modified to increase the resistance of the barrels <b>to</b> <b>fracture</b> and fatigue. Tanks armed with versions of Rheinmetall's gun produced under licence include Japan's Type 90 and South Korea's K1A1. The gun had made a huge turn in technological history.|$|E

5|$|The {{long-term}} {{complications that}} result from restoring teeth with implants relate, directly, to the risk factors of {{the patient and the}} technology. There are the risks associated with appearance including a high smile line, poor gingival quality and missing papillae, difficulty in matching the form of natural teeth that may have unequal points of contact or uncommon shapes, bone that is missing, atrophied or otherwise shaped in an unsuitable manner, unrealistic expectations of the patient or poor oral hygiene. The risks can be related to biomechanical factors, where the geometry of the implants does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are cantilevered extensions, fewer implants than roots or teeth that are longer than the implants that support them (a poor crown-to-root ratio). Similarly, grinding of the teeth, lack of bone or low diameter implants increase the biomechanical risk. Finally there are technological risks, where the implants themselves can fail due <b>to</b> <b>fracture</b> or a loss of retention to the teeth they are intended to support.|$|E
5|$|The defence of the Isthmus of Corinth by the Allies {{changed the}} nature of the war. The Persians did not attempt to attack the isthmus by land, {{realising}} they probably could not breach it. This essentially reduced the conflict to a naval one. Themistocles now proposed what was in hindsight the strategic masterstroke in the Allied campaign; to lure the Persian fleet to battle in the straits of Salamis. However, as successful as this was, {{there was no need for}} the Persians to fight at Salamis to win the war; it has been suggested that the Persians were either overconfident, or overeager to finish the campaign. Thus, the Allied victory at Salamis must at least partially be ascribed to a Persian strategic blunder. After Salamis, the Persian strategy changed. Mardonius sought to exploit dissensions between the Allies in order <b>to</b> <b>fracture</b> the alliance. In particular, he sought to win over the Athenians, which would leave the Allied fleet unable to oppose Persian landings on the Peloponnesus. Although Herodotus tells us that Mardonius was keen to fight a decisive battle, his actions in the run-up to Plataea are not particularly consistent with this. He seems to have been willing to accept battle on his terms, but he waited either for the Allies to attack, or for the alliance to collapse ignominiously. The Allied strategy for 479 BC was something of a mess; the Peloponnesians only agreed to march north in order to save the alliance, and it appears that the Allied leadership had little idea how to force a battle that they could win. It was the botched attempt to retreat from Plataea that finally delivered the Allies battle on their terms. Mardonius may have been overeager for victory; there was no need to attack the Allies, and by doing so he played to the main Allied tactical strength, combat in the melee. The Allied victory at Plataea can also therefore be seen as partially the result of a Persian mistake.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} serious {{injuries}} were multiple lower leg fractures and dislocations, spinal fractures, hip fractures, head injuries, and multiple lacerations and contusions. The NTSB investigators found severe {{damage on the}} floor of the cabin, leading many of the passengers' seats <b>to</b> <b>fracture</b> where the legs met the floor track. This fracturing permitted many of the seats to come loose during the impact and aggravated the passengers' injuries. The report posits that the passengers' legs hit the lower seat frames in front of them. At the same time, the seats collapsed and twisted downward and to the left, likely causing hip and spinal fractures. As the impact progressed, the seats, now separated, flung passengers forward into each other as well as into other wreckage, causing head injuries and lacerations. Passengers holding onto infants reported being unable to either prevent their children from being ejected from their grasp in the impact or locate their children in the darkness afterward. The NTSB held that, had the children been in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved child seats, many injuries might have been mitigated. Rescuers remarked that some infants were found smiling or seemingly unharmed. The NTSB was unable to accurately chart where individual passengers were seated because Avianca only assigned seats to a few passengers and many who were assigned reported moving after takeoff.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} seismic wave {{velocity}} and seismic wave attenuation in dry Bentheimer sandstone, Indiana limestone, and Whitby shale are studied while continuously deforming and therefore increasingly fracturing the rock samples up until macroscopic failure. A pulse transmission technique at a central frequency of 1 MHz {{is used in}} combination with a high pressure system that is constantly applying uniaxial stress. At early deformation stages before yielding, increasing elastic strains correlate with decreasing seismic attenuation suggesting closure of existing fractures. The deviation from a linear stress-strain relationship indicates the yield point, i. e. the onset of plasticity or fracturing. After yielding, increasing plastic strains correspond to increasing seismic attenuation suggesting formation of new micro-fractures. Thereby, P-wave attenuation is {{more sensitive to the}} growth of fractures than S-wave attenuation. The existence of fractures is confirmed by postmortem micro-CT-images. Absolute attenuation values are highest for Indiana limestone and lowest for Whitby shale. Furthermore, S-wave attenuation is the most sensitive <b>to</b> <b>fracturing</b> in Indiana limestone, followed by Bentheimer sandstone; P-wave attenuation is the most sensitive <b>to</b> <b>fracturing</b> in Bentheimer sandstone, followed by Indiana limestone. Attenuation in Whitby shale is the least sensitive <b>to</b> <b>fracturing</b> for both P-waves and S-waves. This study confirms that attenuation is more sensitive <b>to</b> <b>fracturing</b> than the seismic velocity; hence attenuation is suggested to be a valuable seismic parameter <b>to</b> identify <b>fractures.</b> Finally, the study presents the possible usage of amplitude decay-over-time analysis of seismic waves for possible borehole applications and the prediction of induced seismicity.
