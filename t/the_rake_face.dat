40|$|Several {{causes of}} tool wear have been {{investigated}} in dry machining of aluminium alloy with cemented carbide insert; {{some of the most}} important are: adhesion and diffusion. The formation of built-up edge (BUE) and adhesive layer on <b>the</b> tool <b>rake</b> <b>face</b> degrades on <b>the</b> one hand, the shape and efficiency of cutting tool and on the other hand, the surface quality and dimensional accuracy of the finished product. This paper describes tool wear mechanisms in dry machining of a usual aluminium–copper alloy (2024) with an uncoated cemented carbide tool (WC–Co). Orthogonal cutting tests were performed using an instrumented planer machine. The morphology of chips, cutting forces and contact lengths were analyzed for several cutting conditions. The tool–chip interface temperature and the average pressure were calculated by conducting calibration–cutting experiments in conjunction with FEM simulations. This allowed to define the contact parameters associated with different cutting conditions on <b>the</b> tool <b>rake</b> <b>face.</b> High-speed camera movies (CCD), white light interferometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) were investigated to show the development of the built-up edge and the adhesive layer on <b>the</b> tool <b>rake</b> <b>face</b> during machining process.

40|$|AbstractNickel-based {{superalloys}} such as Inconel 718 provide several advantages, {{including a}} high-temperature strength and high corrosion resistance. Therefore {{the demand for}} such materials has rapidly increased, particularly in the aviation and gas turbine applications. On the other hand, they are {{known as one of}} the most difficult-to-cut materials due to their mechanical and chemical properties and the tool life is extremely short. Recently, Cubic-Boron-Nitride (CBN) has received a considerable attention as a material for cutting tools and has already established itself in many areas of machining. However, the performance of CBN tools is still insufficient in practical use, especially in the high speed machining of Inconel 718. To overcome this problem, we first conducted orthogonal cutting experiments on Inconel 718 in a wide range of cutting speeds (20 m/min - 300 m/min) in order to clarify the wear mechanisms of the CBN tool in high speed machining. As a result, it was found that the micro tool surface topography, such as grinding marks on <b>the</b> tool <b>rake</b> <b>face,</b> has a significant impact on the progression of the crater wear of the CBN tool when the cutting speed was increased to over 100 m/min.

40|$|Literature {{survey showed}} that the micro-textures on <b>the</b> tool <b>rake</b> <b>face</b> can help in {{reduction}} in friction at chip-tool interface and therefore, reduction in the cutting forces. Consequently, the current work is based on FE simulation of hard turning of bearing steel (AISI 52100). Four types of micro-textures have been considered on <b>the</b> tool <b>rake</b> face: non-texture, perpendicular, parallel, and rectangle. Johnson-Cook (J-C) material constitutive law has been considered for the workpiece with temperature-dependent material properties. Experimental work has been performed at cutting conditions: type, parallel; edge distance, 0. 195 mm; pitch size, 0. 110 mm; and height of the texture, 0. 049 mm to validate the current machining model. Parametric study of effect of tool feature parameters on the cutting forces has been performed. Based on the current model, {{it is observed that}} the perpendicular shape showed the minimum cutting force. The maximum reduction of 28 % was predicted in the effective coefficient of friction compared to the non-textured surface. Additionally, effect of size of the texture (edge distance, pitch size, texture height) and the friction factor at tool-chip interface on the process responses is predicted. The perpendicular texture at an edge distance of 100 μm, pitch size of 100 μm, and texture height of 50 μm showed the most effective shape and size for the minimum cutting forces and effective friction.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{suggestions}} are current concerning <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> <b>face</b> action of cutting lubricants; that they reduce the shear stress between chip and tool uniformly {{over the whole}} chip-tool contact area; that they reduce the con-tact length between chip and tool; and that they induce conditions on <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> <b>face</b> of the tool in which the interfacial shear stress between chip and tool decreases rapidly with distance from {{the cutting edge of}} the tool. The present work describes experiments on the dry and lubricated orthogonal machining of high permeability iron which have enabled it to be decided which of these theories is correct. The workpiece flow pattern in lubricated machining has been recorded with sufficient accuracy to enable the slip-line field for the flow to be calculated. The shear-stress distribution along the plastic part of the chip-tool contact length has been deduced from the angles at which the slip lines meet <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> <b>face.</b> It has been found that even when the workpiece was flooded with carbon tetrachloride, sticking friction occurred between the chip and tool near the cutting edge of the tool, although good lubrication occurred in the region where the chip left the tool. It has therefore been concluded that the lubricant acted to induce a steep interfacial shear-stress gradient along the chip-tool contact length. The cause of the shear-stress gradient along <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> <b>face</b> in lubricated cutting is discussed in terms of the vary-ing conformity between the chip and tool along the chip-tool contact length. Near the cutting edge of the tool, gross plastic deformation of the workpiece caused the chip to flow into intimate contact with <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> <b>face</b> of the tool, denying lubricant a path along <b>the</b> <b>rake</b> <b>face</b> to the cutting edge.
