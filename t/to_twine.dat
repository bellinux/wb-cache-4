25|$|Tropaeolum is a genus of {{dicotyledonous}} annual or perennial plants, {{often with}} somewhat succulent stems and sometimes tuberous roots. The alternate leaves are hairless, peltate and entire or palmately lobed. The petioles or leaf stalks {{are long and}} in many species are able <b>to</b> <b>twine</b> round other stems to provide support. The flowers are bisexual and showy, set singly on long stalks in the axils of the leaves. They have five sepals, the uppermost of which is elongated into a nectar spur. The five petals are clawed, with the lower three unlike the upper two. The eight stamens are in two whorls of unequal length and the superior ovary has three segments and three stigmas on a single style. The fruit is naked and nut-like, with three single seed segments.|$|E

Twined and coiled basketry were identified with subclasses based on the several diagnostic criteria. 8 subclasses were allocated <b>to</b> <b>twined</b> basketry and 7 subclasses were assigned to coiled basketry. When dealing exclusively with Hogup materials, Dr. Adovasio concluded that coiling was earlier than twining in Hogup Cave and more popular. The textile production and use at Hogup Cave were more common and there was a greater variety in technique and form below Stratum 10. Subclass 13 (one-rod and bundle foundation, noninterlocking stitch) gained its popularity through time due to its adaptability.|$|R

40|$|The {{recognition}} of anterior or posterior displacement o f the fourth ventr icle on axial computed tomography (CT) has proven t o be difficult because the apparent position of this structure is variable and dependent on scanning angle. In most cases d irect visualization of a lesion and its relat ionship to normal anatomic structures {{allows for the}} correct assessment. However, in some instances it would be advantageous for lesion localization {{to be able to}} identif y relatively subtle displacements of the fourth ventricle. This is possible on CT by determining the position of this structure relative <b>to</b> <b>Twining</b> 's line (the line between the tuberculum sellae and torcula). The position of the fourth ventricle, tuberculum sellae, and torcula relative to an arbitrary fixed point can be established in virtually all cases, and thus the position of the fourth ventricle relative to Twining's line can be determined. In a control group of 1 () () patients with normal CT examinations, the ratio of the distance from the tuberculum sellae {{to the center of the}} fourth ventricle and the distance from the tuberculum sellae <b>to</b> torcula (<b>Twining</b> 's line) was between 0. 47 and 0. 53.
