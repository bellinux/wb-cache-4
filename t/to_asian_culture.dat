Le further said that most white families of non-white adoptees are not comfortable talking with their adopted children about the issues that racial minorities face in the United States, and Le further advised white families who adopt transracially that just introducing their kids <b>to</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>culture,</b> telling them that race is not important and/or telling them that people should get equal treatment in society is insufficient. Le said that the social disconnection between how they were raised and the reality of society causes [...] "confusion, resentment about their situation, and anger" [...] for adoptees who were transracially adopted by white families.|$|E

Less than a year later, CinemAsia saw its inception, and in March 2004, the very first edition of the new, biannual film festival saw the light in Amsterdam’s Rialto film theater. Screening 29 films from 12 countries over the span of 5 days, and with an added focus on Asian diaspora and queer cinema, the first edition of the CinemAsia Film Festival was an instant success. The festival was immediately lauded for the way it managed to intimately introduce new audiences to the world of Asian cinema, positively reshaping the Dutch collective consciousness about the continent in the process.2012 marked the year that the CinemAsia Film Festival went annual, having outgrown their biannual programming and locations like De Ketelhuis. As the festival’s size, popularity and frequency grew, so did its ability to offer talented new filmmakers a creative platform and provide Dutch audiences with the best Asian cinema has to offer. Today, CinemAsia is internationally renowned for its broad yet focused selection of Asian independent films, documentaries, shorts, arthouse films and commercial blockbusters. With a bigger location, and a new festival director and visual identity in tow for 2015, CinemAsia has further cemented itself as one of the key Asian film festivals in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|In April 1950, Tyberg {{took the}} boat from Calcutta to California, which {{included}} a stop in Hawaii. There she met her old Benares friend Charles Moore and discussed {{the results of his}} 1949 East-West Convention of Philosophers. From this, she gathered ideas for an approach to Sri Aurobindo that might readily appeal to the Western mind. Her arrival in Los Angeles was met with enthusiasm, and in just the first two weeks, she gave over ten lectures to more than 1,000 attendees. A similarly packed schedule was organized in San Francisco, where she received an enthusiastic reception at Stanford University. America was eager for [...] "the uncensored truth about India" [...] and, in Tyberg's words, California was [...] "just teeming with interest in Sri Aurobindo". Then, in 1951, Tyberg was invited to join the faculty of the newly founded American Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco. The AAAS was the first graduate university devoted <b>to</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>culture,</b> and was considered one of the [...] "principal roots" [...] of the 1960s' [...] "San Francisco Renaissance". Tyberg held the professorship of Sanskrit alongside an international group of colleagues that included Alan Watts, Haridas Chaudhuri, and Dilipkumar Roy. Chaudhuri and Roy were fellow [...] "ardent Aurobindonians" [...] as was Director of Studies, Frederic Spiegelberg, who held Sri Aurobindo to be [...] "the prophet of our age". Spiegelberg highly regarded Tyberg for her teaching approach, which took [...] "Sanscrit as a life force underlying Indian thinking, past and present", and praised her [...] "superior teaching abilities ... the way in which she understood to make every single class meeting a vitally interesting one". As an instructor in a Summer 1952 seminar on Modern India at San Francisco State College, Tyberg's teaching was noted as [...] "exceptionally effective": [...] "It is perfectly clear that she commands a tremendous range of knowledge and insight into the workings of modern Indian society based on both direct experience and extensive study." [...] Tyberg also taught as a lecturer at Stanford University.|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationships}} between acculturation, attitudes towards domestic violence, and attribution of responsibility for domestic violence among Asian Americans. This study proposed that the value of male privilege serves as a mediator of values acculturation <b>to</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>culture</b> and attribution of responsibility to the male aggressor or to the female victim for domestic violence situations. This study was also unique in examining acculturation using an orthogonal model when evaluating Asian Americans' general attitudes towards domestic violence. The entire sample of participants (N= 552) included 330 Asian Americans who were recruited to complete an online survey via listservs, websites, web mailings, and announcements from professors in one southern California university. The survey consisted of demographic information, The Revised Attitudes Toward Wife Abuse Scale (RAWA), A Vignette: Who is Responsible for the Violence?, The Asian Values Scale (AVS), and the Asian American Multidimensional Acculturation Scale (AAMAS). Results indicated that male privilege serves as a complete mediator of values acculturation <b>to</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>culture</b> and attribution of responsibility to the male aggressor, while male privilege serves as a partial mediator of values acculturation <b>to</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>culture</b> and attribution of responsibility to the female victim. Additionally, values acculturation <b>to</b> <b>Asian</b> <b>culture</b> was the most relevant predictor of attitudes towards domestic violence in three domains, while attitudes towards domestic violence were the most salient predictors of attribution of responsibility for domestic violence. Results suggested the importance of differentiating between behavioral acculturation and values acculturation when assessing Asian Americans' attitudes towards domestic violence.; Results also indicated that a particular value of salience (e. g., male privilege) may serve as the mechanism by which adherence to traditional Asian cultural values influences attribution of responsibility for domestic violence. Implications for theory, research, and practice were discussed...|$|E
