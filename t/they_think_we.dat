2500|$|A 2006 article {{reported}} {{incidents of}} violence, disputes and discrimination against Dalits in Maharashtra. The article noted that non-Dalit families claimed {{they do not}} treat Dalits differently. A carpenter caste person said, [...] "We tell them anything and they tell us you are pointing fingers at us because of our caste; we all live together, and there {{are bound to be}} fights, but <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> target them." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 26 December 1941, Churchill {{addressed}} a joint {{meeting of the}} US Congress, asking of Germany and Japan, [...] "What kind of people do <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are?" [...] Churchill initiated the Special Operations Executive (SOE) under Hugh Dalton's Ministry of Economic Warfare, which established, conducted and fostered covert, subversive and partisan operations in occupied territories with notable success; and also the Commandos which established the pattern {{for most of the}} world's current Special Forces. The Russians referred to him as the [...] "British Bulldog." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ribbentrop became Hitler's {{favourite}} foreign-policy adviser, {{partly by}} dint of his familiarity with the world outside Germany, but also by flattery and sycophancy. One German diplomat later recalled that [...] "Ribbentrop didn't understand anything about foreign policy. His sole wish was to please Hitler". In particular, Ribbentrop acquired the habit of listening carefully to what Hitler was saying, memorizing his pet ideas, and then later presenting Hitler's ideas as his own – a practice that much impressed Hitler as proving Ribbentrop was an ideal National Socialist diplomat. Ribbentrop quickly learned that Hitler always favoured the most radical solution to any problem, and accordingly tendered his advice in that direction as a Ribbentrop aide recalled:When Hitler said 'Grey', Ribbentrop said 'Black, black, black'. He always said it three times more, {{and he was always}} more radical. I listened to what Hitler said one day when Ribbentrop wasn't present: 'With Ribbentrop it is so easy, he is always so radical. Meanwhile, all the other people I have, they come here, they have problems, they are afraid, <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> should take care and then I have to blow them up, to get strong. And Ribbentrop was blowing up the whole day and I had to do nothing. I had to break – much better!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Our {{people do}} not talk in this way. <b>They</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> shall all meet again in the spirit-land, to hunt the seal, the walrus, and the bear," [...] {{returned}} Cheenbuk.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come, Harry," [...] said Dr. May, {{pulling off}} the {{spectacles}} {{that had become}} very dewy, [...] "don't let us make fools of ourselves, or <b>they</b> will <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are dying for the scholarship." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh {{but it is}} serious, all the same!" [...] {{she sighed}} as she took up the brush and righted herself. [...] "But do you see <b>they</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are married? <b>They</b> WON'T believe it! It is extraordinary!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> can't {{get along}} without them--which comes pretty near being a fact--and so feel at liberty to ride a high horse," [...] Joe suggested.|$|E

"Perhaps <b>they</b> may <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall {{all take}} a nap, after our tiffin," [...] Will replied; [...] "perhaps--as Yossouf thinks--they have {{sent off to}} some other villages, for assistance. He has gone up the {{hillside}} to look out. Anyhow, I can assure you, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> had better be moving." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because," [...] said he, [...] "in England and Scotland,--that is, in all {{the great}} towns,--if we come on foot, <b>they</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> are poor, and of no consequence, and so give us the worst rooms, and pay us very little attention." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Which friend? But where? Don't look! <b>They</b> will <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were {{watching}} them. I can't {{see them at}} all. Which way were they going?" [...] Mrs. Pasmer dramatised a careless unconsciousness to the square, while vividly betraying this anxiety to her daughter.|$|R
6000|$|... "They are Galus," [...] cried Co-Tan; [...] "they are my own people. Let {{me speak}} to them lest <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> come to fight them. Put me ashore, my man, and I will go meet them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They don't like us," [...] Lenora replied, [...] "because <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> {{are after}} Craig. I wonder what Long Jim has been {{whispering}} to him, {{and what that}} paper is he has been showing Craig. Do you know how far we are from the Mexican border?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And then," [...] Theriere had concluded, [...] "when <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are {{a band of}} heroes, and {{the best}} friends they have on earth we'll just {{naturally}} {{be in a position}} to grab the whole lot of them, and collect ransoms on ten or fifteen instead of just one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I forgot {{if he said}} London. But I {{suppose a}} London more or less hardly matters. <b>They</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall dare come in, {{but if we do}} they will Zeppelin the fleet and walk through our army--if you can call it an army." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed!" [...] cried a linnet. [...] "If we {{submit to}} them <b>they</b> will <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are afraid, and will treat us cruelly. I know {{the nature of}} these rooks, and believe they can only be kept from wickedness by a power {{stronger}} than their own." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Clyde," [...] {{interrupted}} Margery, [...] "you {{must not}} {{sit there and}} speak to me in such an excited way. If any one should see us <b>they</b> would <b>think</b> <b>we</b> were quarrelling. Let us {{go down to the}} lake; the air from the water is cool and soothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{believe that}} they are even looking for us. <b>They</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> went out of the {{business}} two weeks ago," [...] said Dick Norton, as he, in a very unworkmanlike manner, attempted to aid Bob. [...] "You see, Jim is nervous, and the least thing frightens him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see their}} game," [...] said Moore. [...] "The front attack {{is only a}} feint. When <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are all busy here, another {{detachment}} will try to rush the place from the back and to {{set fire to the}} building. We'll 'give them their kail through the reek.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No children," [...] he had {{whispered to}} me across the table; [...] "that's what I can't understand. Nearly four years and no children! What'll be the good of it all? Where do I come in? What do I get? Damn these rotten popinjays! What do <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> buy them for?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lie down, lads," [...] {{the captain}} ordered, [...] "she {{is going to}} give us a broadside. When it is over start one of those sea beggar songs you picked up at Brill; that will startle them, and <b>they</b> will <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are crowded with men and going to board them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The murderers are abroad," [...] {{whispered the}} girl. [...] "Thus will another become the tongue of Luata. It is well for us, since it keeps them {{too busy to}} give the time for searching for us. <b>They</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> cannot escape the city, {{and they know that}} we cannot leave the island--and so do I." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's the {{perpetual}} trouble," [...] he said, [...] "of parent and child. They can't help seeing {{things in the}} way they do. Nor can <b>we.</b> <b>WE</b> don't <b>think</b> they're right, but <b>they</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are. A deadlock. In a very definite sense we are in the wrong--hopelessly in the wrong. But--It's just this: who was to be hurt?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{have not}} the remotest idea of it. They have no {{conception}} {{of what a}} society woman goes through with. <b>They</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> do nothing. They envy us, too, and sometimes they're so ungrateful and indifferent, {{if you try to}} help them, or get on terms with them, that I believe they hate us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it doesn't look so {{beautiful}} as it is," [...] Colville protested. [...] "People in that rosy prime don't produce {{the effect of}} garlanded striplings upon the world at large. The women laugh at us; <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are fat old fellows; they don't recognise the slender and elegant youth that resides in our unwieldy bulk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hope not, Jeekie, because <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> shall die {{the same}} day. But if so, I can't help it. To-morrow morning I shall walk out, and now that's settled. I am tired {{and going to}} sleep," [...] and he threw himself down upon the bed and, being worn out with weariness and anxiety, soon fell fast asleep.|$|E
40|$|The {{sciences}} {{are full}} of theories which, {{in the course of}} making detailed claims about the physical world, say things which entail that there are mathematical entities like numbers and sets. According to an influential tradition stemming from Quine (1948) and Putnam (1972), good scientific reasoning—induction, broadly construed—requires us to believe some such theory, or some disjunction of such theories. And it is because of this that we ought to believe that there are mathematical entities. The belief that there are numbers is, according to this tradition, on a similar epistemological footing to the belief that there are electrons, viruses, quasars, etc. 1 Some will regard this analogy as unhelpful because <b>they</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> can know that there are mathematical entities in the same way—whatever it is—that we know that all dogs are dogs, or that all bachelors are unmarried. 2 Others may regard this analogy as unhelpful because <b>they</b> <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> can directly perceive that there are mathematical entities—such as sets o...|$|R

"Because, like enough, {{they will}} open fire occasionally, {{and if we}} didn't reply <b>they</b> would <b>think</b> <b>we</b> had made off, and would follow us, {{and pick up the}} trail where the horses left the valley. We have got to wait here until it is too dark for them to follow the trail. The moment it is dark enough for that we are off." ...|$|R
