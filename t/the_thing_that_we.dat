Flea said, that he just felt {{like he wanted to}} take two years away just to really look and see if the band was [...] "something we should still be doing". [...] "Things had gotten dysfunctional and not fun, even though I thought we were making great records, doing great shows and were a really powerful, mighty thing as a band. I was proud of what we did." [...] "For me, the biggest thing during the time off, and what really made me want to continue doing the band, specifically after decided he didn't want to continue in the band anymore, [...] I just realized, Anthony, man, he's my brother, I love him so much, and we started this band when we were kids. I wanted to keep that going, I never want to let that go. Playing with him is something, even though I can do other things that are exciting and beautiful and I always will do those things and I'll always want to grow and do music outside of the band, <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have is special to us and something that is blood." ...|$|E

It seemed {{incredible}} that man could be so perfidious--that we had really seen with our own eyes <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had seen; but when we returned to the fort, the shattered wall gave us ample evidence that there was no mistake.|$|E

6000|$|What was {{the nature}} of this air? Priestley found that the same kind of air was to be {{obtained}} by moistening with the spirit of nitre (which he terms nitrous acid) any kind of earth that is free from phlogiston, and applying heat; and consequently he says: [...] "There remained no doubt on my mind but that the atmospherical air, or <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> breathe, consists of the nitrous acid and earth, with so much phlogiston as is necessary to its elasticity, and likewise so much more as is required to bring it from its state of perfect purity to the mean condition in which we find it."

60|$|Now {{most of us}} are {{creatures of}} habit. We do <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have been in the habit of doing, and do it without {{thinking}} anything about it. That is why good habits are such a blessing. Happy Jack Squirrel is {{just like the rest of}} us. He has habits, both good and bad. Of late, he had been in the habit of getting his breakfast at Farmer Brown's house every morning, so now when he began to run from Shadow the Weasel he just naturally ran in the direction of Farmer Brown's house from force of habit. In fact, he was halfway there before he realized in which direction he was running.|$|E

"The {{meaning of}} this is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> must so change in feelings, as no longer {{to be the same}} persons. <b>The</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> loved we must hate, and <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> hated, or at least neglected, we must love.

6000|$|... "I daresay it had {{something}} to do with it," [...] Dick said, with a smile. [...] "There is no doubt that boxing, as we call it, does make you quick. There is not much time to waste in thinking how you are to stop a blow, and to return it at the same moment. One gets into the habit of deciding at once what is the best thing to be done; and I have no doubt that I should not have seen, at once, that one must cut through the netting, run to the window, jump on to Surajah's shoulders, and fire at the tiger, unless I had been sharpened up by boxing. I only say I suppose that, because there were, no doubt, hundreds of men looking on who had pluck enough to face the tiger, and who would have gladly done <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> did, if the idea had occurred to them. The idea did not occur to them, you see, and I have no doubt that it was just owing to that boxing that I thought of it. So you see, Annie, it was, in a way, the fights I had with boys at Shadwell--which is the part of London where I lived--that saved you, and perhaps half a dozen ladies of the sultan's harem, from being killed by that tiger.|$|E
60|$|That is {{the problem}} I would put to all Americans, and to all who claim to {{understand}} America. Who {{and what was that}} man? Was he an astronomer? Was he a detective? Was he a wandering lunatic? If he was a lunatic who thought he was an astronomer, why did he have a badge to prove he was a detective? If he was a detective pretending to be an astronomer, why did he tell a total stranger that he was a detective two minutes after saying he was an astronomer? If he wished to watch over the city in a quiet and unobtrusive fashion, why did he blazon himself all over with all the stars of the sky, and profess to give public lectures on all the subjects of the world? Every wise and well-conducted student of murder stories is acquainted with the notion of a policeman in plain clothes. But nobody could possibly say that this gentleman was in plain clothes. Why not wear his uniform, if he was resolved to show every stranger in the street his badge? Perhaps after all he had no uniform; for these lands were but recently a wild frontier rudely ruled by vigilance committees. Some Americans suggested to me that he was the Sheriff; the regular hard-riding, free-shooting Sheriff of Bret Harte and my boyhood's dreams. Others suggested that he was an agent of the Ku-Klux Klan, that great nameless revolution of the revival of which there were rumours at the time; and that the symbol he exhibited was theirs. But whether he was a sheriff acting for the law, or a conspirator against the law, or a lunatic entirely outside the law, I agree with the former conjectures upon one point. I am perfectly certain he had something else in his pocket besides a badge. And I am perfectly certain that under certain circumstances he would have handled it instantly, and shot me dead between the gay bookstall and the crowded trams. And that is the last touch to the complexity; for though in that country it often seems that the law is made by a lunatic, you never know when the lunatic may not shoot you for keeping it. Only in the presence of that citizen of Oklahoma I feel I am confronted with the fullness and depth of the mystery of America. Because I understand nothing, I recognise <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> call a nation; and I salute the flag.|$|E

5000|$|The album {{would also}} be a very {{personal}} one for each of the members. Drummer Redd Claudio says, [...] "You’ll find that each track is based on a separate experience, it’s just narrating those experiences. That for me, shows how personal it is in that sense." [...] "album is about our lives, heartbreak, <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> celebrate, <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> go through, happiness.

Since then it has {{expanded}} to provide predominantly web-based subscription services to law firms and law departments across a range of specialist subject areas such as corporate, finance, property, tax and intellectual property. Practical Law, the brainchild of two former Slaughter and May lawyers, launched in 1990 as a print venture geared toward transactional lawyers in the United Kingdom. The company's first publications detailed the lawyering requirements for specific types of transactions--highly structured leveraged buyouts and the like--and discussed why certain structures are used for certain types of deals."We created <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> wanted when we were practicing," [...] says Chris Millerchip, Practical Law's cofounder and chairman. Ten years later, the company developed a set of Web-based tools meant to help transactional lawyers work more efficiently.

In the next day, they rewrote the song and they titled [...] "All We Have Is Love" [...] because they thought it fits better into Sabrina's repertoire and album.
