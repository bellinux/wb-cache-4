25|$|The theatre {{building}} was completely restored in 1975–1976 after ownership {{was transferred to}} a local nonprofit group, the Palace Cultural Arts Association. John Eberson's son, Drew Eberson, helped guide the restoration. At that time, the <b>theatre</b> <b>seats</b> were renovated and some were removed to create handicapped-accessible space. The theatre now has seating for 1420 patrons (originally the theatre had seats for 1540 patrons). When the theatre opened, retail space was rented to four businesses on the street level and a medical clinic and beauty shop {{on the second floor}} level. These spaces were remodeled for a concession stand, a box office, theatre offices and multi-purpose spaces.|$|E

The theatre was opened in 1969 and was named after the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation which helped fund its construction. The Gulbenkian Cinema is an independent cinema in the Gulbenkian complex open to students and the general public. It is Kent's regional film theatre showing new mainstream and non-mainstream releases {{as well as a}}rchive and foreign language films.

25|$|The Theatre Royal {{went dark}} on 14 March 2011 {{due to a}} major {{restoration}} of the auditorium, box office, bars and restaurant. The restoration restored the theatre to the original 1901 Frank Matcham Edwardian interior. The whole interior was stripped apart from the original plasterwork which was carefully preserved. The proscenium arch, tiers and boxes were gold leafed and the plasterwork restored. On all levels the seats were replaced with Edwardian-style <b>theatre</b> <b>seats</b> {{in keeping with the}} restoration. The amphitheatre which was removed during previous renovations was restored to offer more leg room and better views than the gallery. This took the theatre to five distinct seating areas, the stalls, grand circle, upper circle, amphitheatre and gallery. Wheelchair spaces were installed on levels which had previously been inaccessible. As well as the boxes near the stage, boxes {{at the rear of the}} grand and upper circles were also restored taking the total number of boxes up to ten. The stage lift and orchestra pit were replaced to offer better facilities for opera and musicals. A new ventilation system was put in place to improve comfort levels in the theatre. New frescos for the lobby and upper circle were commissioned and put in place. This £4.75m project introduced higher standards of comfort and improved energy. The Theatre Royal reopened on 12 September 2011 with Alan Bennett’s epic period drama The Madness of George III; George III was in fact the monarch who gave the Theatre Royal its charter.|$|E

500|$|In December 1943, Speer put Wolters {{in charge}} of {{planning}} for the reconstruction of bombed German cities. [...] Wolters organized a working group of about twenty architects and city planners, mostly from northern Germany. [...] The work of this group, known as the Arbeitsstab Wiederaufbauplanung (Task Force for Reconstruction Planning), would {{form the basis for}} the actual postwar reconstruction of Germany. [...] Speer, who authorized the group, saw an opportunity to make German cities more habitable {{in the age of the}} automobile. [...] The group sought solutions which would use the existing street system, rather than the grand ceremonial boulevards common in Nazi city planning. [...] In addition, the Arbeitsstab issued extensive guidelines, ranging from the width of avenues that carried streetcar lines to the ratio of <b>theatre</b> <b>seats</b> to inhabitants.|$|E
500|$|Greater Manchester has {{the highest}} number of <b>theatre</b> <b>seats</b> per head of {{population}} outside London. Most, if not all, of the larger theatres are subsidised by local authorities or the North West Regional Arts Board. [...] The Royal Exchange Theatre formed in the 1970s out of a peripatetic group staging plays at venues such as at the University [...] Theatre and the Apollo Theatre. A season in a temporary stage in the former Royal Exchange, Manchester was followed by funding for a theatre in the round, which opened in 1976. The Lowry — Greater Manchester's most visited tourist attraction — houses two theatres, used by travelling groups in all the performing arts. [...] The Opera House is a 1,900-seat venue hosting travelling productions, often musicals just out of the West End. Its sister venue, The Palace, hosts generally similar shows. The Oldham Playhouse, one of the older theatres in the region, helped launch the careers of Stan Laurel and Charlie Chaplin. Its productions are described by the 2007 CityLife guide as 'staunchly populist'– and popular. [...] There are many other venues scattered throughout the county, of all types and sizes.|$|E

2500|$|The Minneapolis-Saint Paul {{metropolitan}} area {{is considered to}} be the arts capital of the Upper Midwest. Its major fine art museums include the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, the Walker Art Center, and the Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum. The Minnesota Orchestra and the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra are prominent full-time professional musical ensembles that perform concerts and offer educational programs to the community. [...] Attendance at theatrical, musical, and comedy events in the area is strong, which may be attributed to the cold winters, the large population of post-secondary students, and a generally vibrant economy. The nationally renowned Guthrie Theater moved into a new building in 2006, boasting three stages and overlooking the Mississippi River. In the United States, the number of <b>theatre</b> <b>seats</b> per capita in Minneapolis-Saint Paul ranks behind only New York City; in 2000, 2.3million theatre tickets were sold. [...] The Minnesota Fringe Festival is an annual celebration of theatre, dance, improvisation, puppetry, kids' shows, visual art, and musicals. The summer festival consists of over 800 performances in 11days, and is the largest non-juried performing arts festival in the United States.
