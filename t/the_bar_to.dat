5|$|Einstein and De Haas {{demonstrated}} that magnetization {{is due to}} the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum. They confirmed that this leads <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>to</b> rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.|$|E
5|$|In {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} first half, Van Nistelrooy got his first shot on goal, turning Senderos only to send the ball {{trickling}} along the floor for Lehmann to save comfortably. The first half finished with a foul on Rooney, who had done well to break free of challenges from Cole, Vieira and Senderos, who eventually brought Rooney down. The English forward took the free kick himself, but it went over <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>to</b> cheers from the Arsenal fans {{and the sound of}} the referee's half-time whistle.|$|E

5|$|On 25 May, Johnson {{experienced}} an unusual mission. His section engaged a Dornier Do 217 carrying British markings, four {{miles west of}} his base. Johnson allowed the three inexperienced pilots to attack it, but they only managed to damage the bomber. Days later, on 26 June 1942, Johnson was awarded <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> <b>to</b> his DFC. More welcome news was received late in the month as the first Spitfire Mk. IXs began reaching RAF units. On 10 July 1942, Johnson was promoted {{to the rank of}} squadron leader, effective as of the 13 July, and given command of 610 Squadron.|$|E
5|$|On the Wednesday at 1:00, Galatasaray fans {{attacked}} {{a bar in}} Strøget in Copenhagen, where some Arsenal fans were located. The Arsenal fans left <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>to</b> confront the Galatasaray fans, {{which led to a}} fight lasting for an hour before riot police managed to control it and arrested four Britons and four Turks. In the fight, Paul Dineen, an Arsenal fan, was stabbed, leading to Arsenal offering fans refunds if {{they did not want to}} fly to the game. Dineen was released from hospital later in the day and attended the match as a guest of the Arsenal directors.|$|E

50|$|The {{instrument}} itself {{consisted of}} an open rectangle of metal <b>bars,</b> with <b>the</b> long axis horizontal. Hinges at the connection points between <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> allowed <b>the</b> <b>bars</b> <b>to</b> be rotated to form various parallelograms. Similar hinges were located at the midpoints of <b>the</b> long horizontal <b>bars</b> of <b>the</b> rectangle. These midpoint pivots connected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vertical <b>bar</b> on <b>the</b> table. The result was a pantograph that allowed <b>the</b> long horizontal <b>bars</b> <b>to</b> be rotated into the vertical to point upward at an aircraft, sighting along <b>the</b> upper <b>bar.</b>|$|R
5|$|Flight Lieutenants Ben Erwin Plumer and William Warren Hargrove {{received}} the DFC on 15 December 1944 for shooting down a Messerschmitt Bf 110 on 6 October: F/O Dennis George Tongue {{was awarded the}} DFC on 29 December 1944, and a bar to his DFC on 2 March 1945. F/O Tongue {{was a member of}} the RAF, had been commissioned from sergeant and promoted to flying officer. On the night he won <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>to</b> his DFC, on 25 November 1944, his pilot was A. A. Harrington of the United States Army Air Forces. They destroyed three Junkers Ju 88s, their own Mosquito having been hit by debris from the second Ju 88, and during the fight that led to the downing of the third, Tongue was also having to keep track of a further Ju 88 which was endeavouring to attack their aircraft.|$|E
5|$|He {{was elected}} to Parliament in 1805 for Gatton, a rotten borough, and became Solicitor General for England and Wales in 1812 and Attorney General for England and Wales a year later. Although not happy in Parliament, having been {{returned}} only for political purposes, Garrow acted {{as one of the}} principal Whig spokesmen trying to stop criminal law reform as campaigned for by Samuel Romilly and also attempted to pass legislation to condemn animal cruelty. In 1817, he was made a Baron of the Exchequer and a Serjeant-at-Law, forcing his resignation from Parliament, and he spent the next 15 years as a judge. He was not particularly successful in the commercial cases the Exchequer specialised in, but when on Assize, used his criminal law knowledge from his years at <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> <b>to</b> great effect. On his resignation in 1832 he was made a Privy Councillor, a sign of the respect HM Government had for him. He died on 24 September 1840.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} Sam sold <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>to</b> a corporation, the place caters {{to a more}} {{up-market}} clientele. Eddie Lebec turns up and is surprised when Carla Tortelli tells him she is pregnant (incorporated by actress Rhea Perlman's real-life pregnancy). Sam Malone then returns to the bar after his attempt to sail around the world failed at the first hurdle when his sailboat ran ashore in the Caribbean. Though Cheers has new management, Woody Boyd and Carla are still employed at the bar, but they're now required to wear uniforms, much to their chagrin. Sam then also needs a job, but the bar already has two bartenders, Woody and a new employee, Wayne. Diane Chambers' attempts at writing her novel {{are said to have}} failed, which led to her leaving Boston to write in Hollywood.|$|E

5|$|The agents authorize Jones {{to recover}} the Ark to prevent the Nazis from obtaining it. He travels to Nepal and discovers that Abner has died, and the {{headpiece}} is {{in the possession of}} Ravenwood's daughter Marion. Jones visits Marion at her tavern, where she reveals her bitter feelings toward him from a previous romantic affair. She physically rebuffs his offer to buy the headpiece, and Jones leaves. Shortly after, a group of thugs arrive with their Nazi commander, Arnold Toht. Toht threatens Marion to get the headpiece, but when Jones returns to <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>to</b> fight the Nazis and save Marion, her bar is accidentally set on fire; during the fight, the headpiece ends up in the fire and Toht severely burns his hand trying to take the hot headpiece, and flees the tavern screaming. Indy and Marion escape with the headpiece, and Marion decides to accompany Indy in his search for the Ark so he can repay his debt to her.|$|E
5|$|State {{auditors}} Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe) and Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott) soon arrive, and {{the extremely}} cheerful Chris paints an optimistic {{picture of how}} they will fix the budget, but leaves the details to the more serious Ben. When Ben explains {{they will need to}} slash the budget of every department by nearly 40 or 50 percent, Leslie angrily lashes out at Ben, who responds to her that the poorly managed government is to blame. Later, at April's party, Tom desperately tries to pick up women, but to no avail, while Leslie and Ann get extremely drunk together. Andy and April appear to be getting along, but when he goes to <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>to</b> get a drink for April, a drunken Ann flirts with him. An upset April flirts with Tom's annoying friend Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz) to make Andy jealous. Andy gets upset, believing he misread April's signals all along, and April later regrets what she did. Ben arrives at the party and tries to smooth things out with a drunken Leslie, but she again angrily lashes out at him.|$|E
5|$|The 10th Battalion {{was back}} in action on 22–23 August as the Allied advance {{continued}} north of Proyart. The 10th Battalion was in a supporting role protecting the flank of the 1st Brigade. Upon learning of some difficulties due to German positions in Luc Wood, the commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Maurice Wilder-Neligan, immediately tasked McCann, commanding two companies, to clear the area. Along with flanking troops, McCann cleared the wood, capturing 15 prisoners and four machine guns. The advance was then able to continue. McCann temporarily commanded the battalion for a week in late August, before being promoted to temporary major on 23 September. The battalion saw its last action {{of the war in}} late September. McCann again temporarily commanded the battalion for a week in early October, and was substantively promoted to major on 21 October. Shortly after this he attended a strategy and tactics course at the Staff College, Camberley, before returning to the battalion in November, when he was appointed as unit second-in-command. In early January 1919 he was appointed as commanding officer. He commanded the 10th Battalion until its disbandment in March, and was mentioned in Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig's final despatch of 16 March 1919. Also in March, he led a party of American delegates {{on a tour of the}} war zone and, in the following month, he headed the 3rd Brigade contingent in the Anzac Day march through London. On 3 May he was invested with his Distinguished Service Order and <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>to</b> his Military Cross at Buckingham Palace. Later that month he embarked for Australia, and arrived back in Adelaide in June. He was admitted to Keswick Repatriation General Hospital on his return, and was discharged from the AIF on 8 September 1919. Two of McCann's brothers also served in the AIF, with one being killed in action. In addition to the decorations previously mentioned, McCann was also issued with the 1914–15 Star, British War Medal, and Victory Medal for his service during the war.|$|E
