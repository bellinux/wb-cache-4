Mechanical presses have a full <b>tonnage</b> <b>rating</b> point above BDC / Bottom Dead Center, normal full <b>tonnage</b> <b>rating</b> points are [...]187", [...]25" [...] & [...]5". Hence a mechanical press has a tonnage curve and should be operated within the press capacity limits.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Extraction of coal by {{longwall}} mining methods has improved greatly over recent years with <b>tonnage</b> <b>rates</b> per week now surpassing yearly tonnes {{of a few}} years ago. As mines go deeper and <b>tonnage</b> <b>rates</b> increase then gas emission also increases. For the purposes of understanding gas emission and planning strategies short and long term, modelling of gas emission using the “Pore Pressure ” longwall gas emission technique, illustrated is an attempt to model this phenomenon. The input data to the model includes the gas reservoir properties relevant to underground coal seams and extraction of coal using the longwall technique to evaluate the release of gas into the mine workings. Variations in weekly production, face airflow quantities, the efficiency of gas drainage levels and differing face widths can be tested using the model. Mine planners can use the interactive spreadsheet developed through this model to assess the limits of production, ventilation capacity and gas drainage requirements...|$|R

40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Fall 2015 Clips and Clamps Industries (CCI) {{produces}} {{small metal}} parts, {{many of which}} are formed using metal forming fourslide machines. CCI’s fourslide machines have been experiencing failures and increased maintenance due to the usage of high-strength steels that require more force to form. In order to minimize damage and maintenance, CCI has asked to implement a sensor that detects the forces on the slide while the machine is in operation, to incorporate a safety control to automatically shut off the machine when a programmed force is exceeded, and to calculate the maximum <b>tonnage</b> <b>rating</b> on the forming section—specifically the front slide as this is the area prone to failure. This design must also be scalable so that it may be implemented on both the smaller, S 3 F and larger, S 4 F machines. After initial research and defining the project scope, finite element analysis simulations on the slide and gathering feedback from sponsors at CCI and professors at the University of Michigan, the final design was solidified as a Wintriss strain link sensor bolted {{to the top of the}} slide. Through Solidworks CAD models, data was gathered regarding strains on the slide to justify the location of the sensor while assuring that the design would not hinder the fourslide machine operation or compromise safety. The risk associated with the design has been assessed in both a risk analysis and FMEA, raising concerns with safety and potential failures. The final design has been manufactured and was installed in a fourslide machine at CCI. To validate whether the design meets the project requirements, the strain link was calibrated with a load cell to ensure accuracy as well as tested to ensure functionality of auto-shutoff capability. Additionally, through theoretical modeling including finite element and fatigue analysis, the maximum <b>tonnage</b> <b>rating</b> was determined to be 4. 5 tons. This maximum <b>tonnage</b> <b>rating</b> will be validated and further refined through empirical testing over time carried out by CCI...|$|E

Lieutenant-Colonel Addison was duly despatched from the Board of Trade to inspect the canal and the affairs of the company in 1898. Despite local allegations that the canal was unnavigable, and the findings of Addison that the east bank needed to be strengthened, the channel was shallow in places, and the gates needed to be repaired, he ruled that the canal was still navigable. However, the operating company was deemed to be a public company, to whom the 1888 Act applied, and the <b>tonnage</b> <b>rate</b> was reduced to 6d (2.5p) per ton by the Board of Trade, one quarter of the rate that had previously been charged.|$|R

40|$|BHP Billiton Iron Ore has {{replaced}} the conventional product quality control batch system at Yandi with the Continuous Stockpile Management System (CSMS) centred on a fully integrated “continuous ” stockpile flow from mine planning through to port reclaiming. With increasing <b>tonnage</b> <b>rates,</b> tight operational coupling associated with the original batch system caused production interference which achieved final product quality but in an increasingly inefficient manner. This innovative approach places a continuous emphasis on product grade control and takes {{full advantage of the}} most appropriate blending opportunities of the mine to port planning and production system {{in order to reduce the}} natural variability of the ore to an acceptable level. To implement continuous control, product variability throughout the process is classified as long term and short term. Long term variability is best controlled through the monthly mine planning process which determines monthly grade targets while taking into account optimum mine development. In the past, attempts to control long term variability were made at the Port through selective stockpiling and reclaiming which reduced operational efficiency. Short term variability is best controlled around the monthly mine grade target by daily mine production scheduling, train sequencing, stacking into port stockpiles of appropriate size and systematical stockpile reclaiming. The implementation of the new system has maintained customer accepted shipping grades and has provided significant improvements in resource utilisation, operational efficiencies and costs...|$|R
40|$|Chutes are {{commonly}} used to re-direct the flow of bulk solids at interchange points in a conveyor assembly. Requirements for the efficient handling of material at high <b>tonnage</b> <b>rates</b> place constraints on chute design. Poor design can result in chute blockages, both static and dynamic plugging, spillage, and reductions in chute conveyor belt life due to uncontrolled wear. Particle attrition often occurs, leading to unwanted dust generation and degradation of material. Numerical modelling of material flow in a transfer chute can help prevent costly mistakes by identifying poor flow properties in the design or implementation of the chute prior to it being put into operation. The entire system is rarely studied as a whole. Often different models are used separately for the different stages of the flow such as discharge, sliding, impact and free-fall. An alternative is Discrete Element Modelling (DEM) which tracks the motion and interactions of all the individual particles in the bulk material and provides {{a powerful tool for}} studying such complex granular flows. This paper discusses the use of DEM to aid in the design of bulk materials handling transfer chutes and reports on 3 D DEM simulation of material flow in a series of real conveyor assemblies using realistic non-spherical particle shapes. The DEM method is shown to be a useful tool allowing extraction of many selective parameters that are difficult to isolate using a continuum based approach. DEM is also a valuable visualisation tool to better understand the flows in chutes...|$|R

40|$|BHP-Billiton 2 ̆ 7 s Minera Escondida Limitada {{is one of}} {{the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s largest copper producers. It treats a {{combined}} 88 million tons of copper ore per year through its two concentrators: Los Colorados and Laguna Seca. Over the past three years, metallurgical sampling has been performed at the Laguna Seca concentrator to calibrate both the JKSimMet and JKSimFloat grinding and flotation simulators. In the past, the calibrated simulators have been used to predict the effect of changes in operating conditions in the grinding and flotation circuits separately. To assist in the development of future processing options, predictions were required of the effect of changing grinding circuit conditions on flotation performance. This was achieved by using an integrated grinding and flotation simulation. The grinding circuit performance was predicted under different operating conditions (such as <b>tonnage</b> <b>rate</b> and product grind size) using JKSimMet, and these results were then used in JKSimFloat to predict the flotation performance for the new grinding circuit product. This combination of the simulators allows both the effects of residence time and grind size on flotation performance to be investigated. This paper presents the first combined grinding and simulation modelling and simulation case study using JKSimMet and JKSimFloat. The modelling and simulation methodologies for the grinding and flotation circuits are discussed along with the circuit simulations that were performed. The simulator predictions are presented in conjunction with independent laboratory results of the new operating conditions. The ability to predict flotation circuit performance based on changes in grinding circuit performance is also discussed. This methodology provides improved predictions of flotation circuit performance when grinding circuit changes (including grinding capacity increases) are made...|$|R

40|$|The work by H. K. Worner and {{co-workers}} at CRA in the 1960 s, and early 1970 s, established that molten metals could be refined continuously utilising counter current flow {{of metal and}} slag. Worner also demonstrated that counter current refining could produce highly refined metal products. These developments coincided {{with the advent of}} high intensity metallurgical reactors in both the ferrous and non-ferrous industries (e. g. BaS, Q-BOP and later Sirosmelt) that utilised high levels of gas injection to produce rapid stirring and very fast reaction. These new generation of high intensity metallurgical reactors allowed high <b>tonnage</b> <b>rates</b> through relatively small volume vessels. Whilst, {{it is well known that}} the counter current flow of reacting phases offers the potential of efficient mass transfer and high purity products, the application of counter current reactors to molten metal/slag systems has been criticized on the basis that they suffer from either low intensity or, alternately, from poor refining due to excessive dispersion. These criticisms relate to the balance between intensity and the refining capacity of a reactor. That is, whilst high levels of mixing transversely to the direction of flow promotes high mass transfer, longitudinal mixing (dispersion) is detrimental to refining. Of course, mixing in one direction invariably leads to mixing in other directions, thus creating a playoff between high mass transfer and excessive dispersion. This balance between intensity and refining has been the subject of recent studies overseas, and at the University of Wollongong, using cold modelling techniques to evaluate the effect of mixing on dispersion in a counter current refining launder. These studies have shown that for a given geometry and mixing regime, dispersion decreases with increasing flow of liquid phases. This means that whilst high mass transfer cannot be achieved in a refining launder without sacrificing the degree of refinement, there is no impediment to achieving high productivity through such a system, in fact, high through puts may favour good refining. Thus, it may be possible to match a high productivity smelting operation with a equally productive counter current refining stage...|$|R

Optimum LNG supply chain is obtained through the integration among states in supply chain and high utilization of facilities in every single stage.

40|$|Low rank fuels such as subbituminous coals and lignites contain {{significant}} amounts of moisture compared to higher rank coals. Typically, the moisture content of subbituminous coals ranges from 15 to 30 percent, while that for lignites is between 25 and 40 percent, where both are expressed on a wet coal basis. High fuel moisture has several adverse impacts on the operation of a pulverized coal generating unit. High fuel moisture results in fuel handling problems, and it affects heat <b>rate,</b> mass <b>rate</b> (<b>tonnage)</b> of emissions, and the consumption of water needed for evaporative cooling. This project deals with lignite and subbituminous coal-fired pulverized coal power plants, which are cooled by evaporative cooling towers. In particular, the project involves use of power plant waste heat to partially dry the coal before it is fed to the pulverizers. Done in a proper way, coal drying will reduce cooling tower makeup water requirements and also provide heat rate and emissions benefits. The technology addressed in this project makes use of the hot circulating cooling water leaving the condenser to heat the air used for drying the coal (Figure 1). The temperature of the circulating water leaving the condenser is usually about 49 C (120 F), and this {{can be used to}} produce an air stream at approximately 43 C (110 F). Figure 2 shows a variation of this approach, in which coal drying would be accomplished by both warm air, passing through the dryer, and a flow of hot circulating cooling water, passing through a heat exchanger located in the dryer. Higher temperature drying can be accomplished if hot flue gas from the boiler or extracted steam from the turbine cycle is used to supplement the thermal energy obtained from the circulating cooling water. Various options such as these are being examined in this investigation. This is the eleventh Quarterly Report for this project. The background and technical justification for the project are described, including potential benefits of reducing fuel moisture using power plant waste heat, prior to firing the coal in a pulverized coal boiler. During this last Quarter, the development of analyses to determine the costs and financial benefits of coal drying was continued. The details of the model and key assumptions being used in the economic evaluation are described in this report...|$|R
