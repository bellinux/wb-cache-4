When leaving Sweden, the team was informed that the players would stay at one hotel, their wives at another. The players threatened not to go, and the arrangements were changed to keep the players and wives together at the Intourist Hotel. The players' wives were fed sub-standard food and the players would smuggle some of their food to their wives. The team had contracted to have Canadian beer and steaks delivered to them in Moscow. The beer was lost at the airport, while <b>the</b> <b>steaks</b> were cut in half. At a practice after game six, the Soviets tried to cut short the Canadians' practice.|$|E
25|$|Mosterín’s {{interest}} in wildlife {{led to an}} early collaboration with Félix Rodríguez de la Fuente, the famous Spanish naturalist and documentary director, for promoting public awareness and appreciation of wild nature; this included the successful Fauna Encyclopedia. Opposed to all spectacles of cruelty, Mosterín has taken a firm stand against bullfighting. He contributed decisively to the discussion leading to the ban of bullfights in Catalonia (Spain) in 2010. Subsequently, he has published two books analyzing this cruel tradition and offering a devastating refutation of all proposed attempts to justify it. As honorary president of the Spanish Great Ape Project, he has cooperated with Peter Singer in advocating certain minimal legal rights for great apes. While firmly rejecting all forms of gross cruelty to animals, Mosterín has adopted a realist {{point of view in}} the controversies about the use of animals in research and nutrition, taking into account the various dimensions of the problems and insisting in the implementation of obligatory standards of animal welfare. He proposes the elimination of unnecessary and painful experiments, the abolition of factory farming based on confinement that prevents animals from displaying their genetically programmed behavior, and stopping the specially destructive and cruel forms of commercial fisheries like bottom trawling. In as far as meat continues to be eaten in the future, Mosterín suggests that <b>the</b> <b>steaks</b> could be grown in vitro from stem cells.|$|E

At 2 a.m. during calving season, Bradley boards her pickup truck and drives past the pens, and with her searchlight looks for pregnant cows in distress and, as needed, summons for help. She cooks all three meals for the ranch, sometimes serving a half-dozen persons. For each meal, she uses beef from her own feed yard and packing facility. In 1986, the Bradleys developed B3R Country Meats in Childress. They were instrumental in defining national standards for natural beef products. In 2002, the company was sold to George Gillette.

The first to finish was Pho-Nomenal Dumplings, followed by GD Bro, and Waffle Love. They received an extra $250 each.

60|$|<b>The</b> <b>steaks</b> we {{had that}} night, and they were fine; and the {{following}} morning we tasted the broth. It seemed odd to be eating a creature that should, by all the laws of paleontology, have been extinct for several million years.

From the top of the rising ground where the fire was burning and <b>the</b> <b>steaks</b> of mare's flesh roasting, the complete circle of the horizon could be seen, and the yellow-brown grass of the Pampas, at that time about a foot high, rolled with a motion that strangely resembled the waves of the liquid ocean itself.|$|E

50|$|Studies on rats to {{determine}} how they react to different tasting liquids and injections indicate this difference. Scientists measured the facial and somatic reactions of rats after exposure to a flavored solution (sucrose or salt) which do not induce abnormal feelings. However, immediately after the rat ingests the solution, the rat is injected with a drug that induces nausea. The rat subsequently expresses a disgust reaction towards the solution, seen by mouth gaping. This is a Pavlovian conditioned response as the rat is associating the disgust with the solution that it drank immediately before the injection. The rat experiences taste aversion. This is similar to when a human, for example, eats a steak that is perfectly safe and edible and coincidentally contracts a stomach bug and starts vomiting {{within a few hours}} of eating <b>the</b> <b>steak.</b> Although <b>the</b> human may know that the vomiting was due to a virus and not from eating <b>the</b> <b>steak,</b> <b>the</b> conditioned response in the brain associates <b>the</b> <b>steak</b> with vomiting due to the timing and the human may avoid steak because he has developed a learned taste aversion to <b>the</b> <b>steak.</b>|$|R

60|$|To say truth, men out {{in those}} regions have usually such good appetites {{that they are}} not {{particular}} as to the cooking of their food. Quantity, not quality, is what they desire.

We had a pleasant meal, with only one unfortunate occurrence--when Olson suggested that possibly the creature we were eating was {{the same one that}} ate the German. It was some time before we could persuade the girl to continue her meal, but at last Bradley prevailed upon her, pointing out that we had come upstream nearly forty miles since the boche had been seized, and that during that time we had seen literally thousands of these denizens of the river, indicating that the chances were very remote that this was the same Plesiosaur.
