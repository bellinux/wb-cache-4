25|$|When Maggie's boyfriend, Henry Chin, cheats on an exam, Maggie {{is almost}} {{expelled}} from school for letting him look {{off of her}} paper. She tries to help him in any way she can. He is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>guy</b> she has romantic feelings for. Henry, not wanting Maggie to suffer for his bad actions any longer, confesses to higher authority. Maggie is permitted to stay at PVU, and helps Henry pursue his music career. She says goodbye to him when his group goes on tour. Maggie soon learns that Michael Cambias has recently raped Bianca. She {{is the first one}} Bianca tells of this and encourages Bianca to let David examine her. Bianca refuses, saying that she is fine. The truth comes out later, however, and Maggie holds Bianca's hand through the whole rape exam. She is Bianca's entire emotional support and their bond deepens. When Bianca again pursues her ex-girlfriend Lena Kundera, Maggie shows signs of jealousy. Though having been sexually intimate with Jamie Martin, she agrees to help him make Babe Carey Chandler (the object of Jamie's affections) jealous if he keeps up the ruse that he is Maggie's boyfriend. This also serves to hide Maggie's romantic feelings for Bianca.|$|E

500|$|A March 1969 {{meeting between}} Slayton, George Low, Bob Gilruth, and Chris Kraft {{determined}} that Armstrong {{would be the}} first person on the Moon, in some part because NASA management saw Armstrong as a person who did not have a large ego. A press conference held on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong's being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the lunar module pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. Slayton added, [...] "Secondly, just on a pure protocol basis, I figured the commander ought to be <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>guy</b> out... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision." [...] At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his 2001 autobiography.|$|E
500|$|During the 2005–06 season, Laich {{played in}} 104 {{regular season and}} playoff games between the Capitals and their new AHL affiliate, the Hershey Bears; this tied him for the most games played in the {{organization}} with Boyd Gordon. After training camp, he started the season in the AHL, but was optimistic about his chances {{to play in the}} NHL, saying, [...] "You've just got to work hard. There's spots up there, guys could go down with an injury, you want to be <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>guy</b> called up." [...] He spent most of the season at the NHL level, playing in 73 games and recording 21 points. After the Capitals' season was over, Laich rejoined the Bears for their playoff run and scored eight goals in 21 games while helping the team capture the Calder Cup. Laich played the entire 2006–07 season with the Capitals, scoring eight goals and adding ten assists. After the season, Laich and the Capitals went to salary arbitration, where he was awarded a one-year contract worth $725,000.|$|E
500|$|The band hired Shirley {{and agreed}} to his {{recording}} conditions, which meant recording in New York City at Avatar Studios, taking weekends off and recording from 1:00–8:00pm. [...] Chris said of the rigid schedule, [...] "We loved it.... We had lives other than just being in the studio 24 hours a day, seven days a week. [...] Got a different vantage point on the whole thing." [...] Shirley's laid-back style also won praise from the band. [...] "Kevin is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>guy</b> that I've worked with that just went with it—especially my singing. [...] A lot of this album is just my scratch vocals. It's very loose, and Kevin let it go.... He'd say, if we didn't get it {{in two or three}} takes, 'We'll come back tomorrow'", said Chris. [...] Of the album's lyrical bent, Chris said, [...] "...there is a lot of love on it, and I've never written love songs. [...] I do think having a muse in my life like the woman I'm with now helped.... I think there's also a lot of humor on this album, which is something we haven't touched on before, except maybe on Shake Your Money Maker, which was a lighter time and a lighter mood." [...] There was also a conscious effort to [...] "simplify the language", [...] which was inspired by Chris's listening to music by Otis Redding, George Jones and Muddy Waters. [...] "I realized how direct and honest those records were – and I wanted that here", said Chris.|$|E

2500|$|State {{attorneys}} called {{current and}} former police officers and the two lead prosecutors, who testified that the investigation had been careful, and that no witnesses had been coerced or threatened. The lead detective testified that his investigation was [...] "very meticulous and careful… I was in no rush just to pick <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>guy</b> we got our hands on. I wanted the right guy." [...] He stated that witnesses gave [...] "strikingly similar descriptions on how the shooter was dressed", mostly describing the shooter as wearing a white T-shirt and dark pants, which other witnesses said Davis was wearing that evening. A state attorney asserted that the testimony of at least five prosecution witnesses remained unchallenged, and the evidence of Davis's guilt was overwhelming. In July 2010, Davis's lawyers filed a motion asking Moore to reconsider his decision to exclude testimony from a witness to a confession by Coles, but in August 2010, Moore stood by his initial decision, stating that in not calling Coles, Davis's lawyers were seeking to implicate Coles without desiring his rebuttal.|$|E
2500|$|What ensued {{was one of}} {{the most}} vitriolic {{corporate}} battles of the 1980s, with Perot and Smith publicly exchanging barbs using the media, which delightedly splashed the story over every business publication in the U.S.. Perot notoriously lashed out at Smith in a 1988 exclusive to Fortune Magazine, saying: [...] "My question is: Why haven't we unleashed their potential? The answer is: the General Motors system. It's like a blanket of fog that keeps these people from doing what they know needs to be done. I come from an environment where, if you see a snake, you kill it. At GM, if you see a snake, the first thing you do is go hire a consultant on snakes. Then you get a committee on snakes, and then you discuss it for a couple of years. The most likely course of action is—nothing. You figure, the snake hasn't bitten anybody yet, so you just let him crawl around on the factory floor. We need to build an environment where <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>guy</b> who sees the snake kills it." [...] Perot went on to needle Smith regarding the opulent 25th floor GM offices in New York, [...] "An entire teak forest must have been decimated for that floor". Smith, who had obviously ignored the irony of the CEO of the largest public corporation in the world complaining about the opulence of the private office (which Perot had personally paid to furnish) of a rival, had responded to Perot's frequent criticism of GM's executive perks a year earlier, [...] "Perot's office (in Dallas) 'makes mine look like a shanty-town. He has Remingtons; he has a Gilbert Stuart painting hanging on the wall. Nobody runs around saying 'Get rid of Ross's office'".|$|E
2500|$|B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 67, based on 16 reviews. Jordan Sargent of Spin said, [...] "B.O.A.T.S. II ups the production values {{like a true}} sequel should. Whereas his last album felt at times like a mixtape in expensive packaging, the beats here are full and gleaming with the fruits of success." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone said [...] "his second LP further displays his knack for playfully hollering about money like he's <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>guy</b> who ever had so much paper he couldn't fold it. He tries on some new looks here but nothing slows down the self-described Black Unicorn's scene-chewing charisma." [...] At USA Today, Elysa Garnder evoked that [...] "2 Chainz wraps his gritty flow in bright, crisp arrangements. And he's not afraid to wax lyrical now and then, notably on the pining, lushly orchestrated [...] "Black Unicorn"." [...] Dan Rys of XXL stated, [...] "while the album is billed as the continuation of his first record, last year’s No. 1-debuting Based on a T.R.U. Story, Chainz also branches out a bit {{in a way that}} makes the album feel like he’s bringing at least some new records to the table while remaining stylistically consistent." [...] Kevin Ritchie of Now said, [...] "Sonically, B.O.A.T.S. II is slightly more adventurous than its predecessor thanks to Pharrell’s funky summer jam [...] "Feds Watching" [...] and the EDM-influenced [...] "Netflix", a Diplo-Fergie tag team. 2 Chainz likes to offset the raunchy with the heartfelt, but when the tone shifts to earnestly autobiographical, he sounds derivative." [...] Paul Cantor of Vibe stated, [...] "B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time really does what it set out to do—prove that 2 Chainz, while occasionally unfocused, is more than a guy who just makes trap music. Make no mistake, there’s a lot of that here, and he’s almost got that formula down to science." ...|$|E

On August 6, Thome was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a herniated disk; he remained on the DL until September 21. In his first game back, he drove in the game-winning RBI in extra innings against the Boston Red Sox. After beating the Indians in a game where he hit his 611th career home run, Thome said, [...] "There's a lot of memories. I've had great memories on that side and then coming in here as an opponent against them. Any time you come home, they say, it's very special. It's even more special to get the W's. That's, I think, the main thing. The bottom line is I played here a long time." [...] Orioles teammates remarked at Thome's commitment to talking about the game while in the dugout. Thome remarked, [...] "I talk the game. When I sit in the dugout during games, I talk baseball to these guys. They'll ask, 'Hey, what's this pitcher like?' or 'What about the game?' 'What about all those Indians teams you were on?' I did it to Eddie Murray {{when he was in his}} 40s." [...] The Orioles made the playoffs, but lost in five games to the Yankees during the AL Division Series. Thome hit [...]133 in the playoffs with no home runs or RBIs.|$|E
