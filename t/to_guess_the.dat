5|$|Flanagan {{observes that}} in Tenebrae, Argento offers two {{characters}} {{who suffer from}} impaired vision. Gianni (Christian Borromeo) is an eyewitness to an axe-murder, but the trauma of seeing the killing causes him to disregard a vital clue. Returning {{to the scene of}} the crime, he suddenly remembers everything, and is murdered before being able to tell anyone. Homicide detective Giermani reveals that he is a big fan of the novels of Agatha Christie, Mickey Spillane, Rex Stout, and Ed McBain, but admits that he has never been able <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> identity of the killer in any of the books. He is similarly unable to solve the real mystery until the last corpses are piled at his feet – he cannot see Peter Neal for what he really is.|$|E
5|$|Later medieval chroniclers, such as Roger of Wendover, {{gave some}} {{information}} about East Anglian events, but Yorke suggests that the annalistic format used forced these writers <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> dates of the key events they recorded. Such later sources are therefore treated with caution. The Anglian collection, which dates from the late 8th century, contains an East Anglian genealogical tally, but Rædwald is not included. Rædwald is however {{referred to in the}} 8th century Vita of St Gregory the Great, written {{by a member of the}} religious community at Whitby. The Battle of the River Idle, in which Rædwald and his forces defeated the Northumbrians, is described in the 12th century Historia Anglorum, written by Henry of Huntingdon.|$|E

(with a maximum of 250kg.), which would work out to the limit of a sustainable population of 1,250,000 people. As this is the maximum number, the difference between the population of Herodian Israel and other eras in the Second Temple Period, up to the Byzantine period, is left <b>to</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>The</b> proportion of Jews to gentiles is also unknown.|$|E

Since records began in 1851, ice-out has happened as early as March 18 and as late as May 12, although 90 percent of the time it is declared during April. This official ruling is made by David Emerson of Emerson Aviation.|$|E

25|$|In part, secrecy {{was also}} {{maintained}} by the way scripts were written. Performers were given the first two scripts {{at the start of}} principal photography, but additional scripts were written only after Chibnall had observed the actors bringing their characters to life. Once the scripts for episodes six, seven, and eight were finished, they were released all at once—but only to those crew and cast who had a need to know. These three episodes were then shot together. The secrecy campaign did not, however, prevent the cast and crew from trying <b>to</b> <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> murderer's identity. During production, photographs of all the cast members were pasted up in a production trailer, and cast and crew placed bets on who they thought the killer was.|$|E
25|$|The {{conception}} of Vicki Fowler in 1985 {{was one of}} the first controversial storylines featured in EastEnders since its inception that February, as it involved the pregnancy of a schoolgirl, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). Exploiting a whodunnit angle, viewers were not initially told who was the father, and press interest in the fledgling show escalated as journalists attempted <b>to</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>The</b> audience finally discovered his identity in October 1985 on episode 66. Written by series co-creator/script-editor Tony Holland and directed by co-creator/producer Julia Smith, it was considered a landmark episode in the show's history. Four possible suspects were seen leaving the Square early in the episode: Tony Carpenter (Oscar James), Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), and Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). As Michelle waited by their rendezvous point, a car pulled up and the fluffy white legs of the soap landlord's poodle Roly leapt out of a car and gave it all away: Den Watts had fathered Michelle's baby. After this storyline the programme started to appear in newspaper cartoons as it moved more and more into the public mainstream.|$|E
