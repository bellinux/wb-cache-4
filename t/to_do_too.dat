500|$|The {{first episode}} of the season premiered in Los Angeles on September 23, 2015, with the season, {{consisting}} of 22 episodes, airing on ABC beginning on September 29, 2015 until May 17, 2016. The premiere was watched by 4.90 million viewers, higher than any {{episode of the}} entire second half of season two. Overall, the season had generally consistent ratings, and received positive reviews; critics felt the series had 'hit its stride' with the season, and particularly praised the risky bottle episode [...] "4,722 Hours", though the pacing of the season received criticism for trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>too</b> much at times.

Another critic from The Hindu, Gudipoodi Srihari, appreciated the pair of Kamal and Madhavan, noting that the duo [...] "make a fine combination of pals each with different mental make up, but goodness overflowing." [...] A reviewer from Sify, in comparison, labelled the film as [...] "average", stating that it was [...] "another predictable and corny film which is neither a comedy caper nor a class act." [...] Similarly, Arkay of Rediff.com praised the performances of the lead cast but wrote the film [...] "tries <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>too</b> many things, and ends up failing at most, if not all, of them." ...|$|E

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed, or simply {{referred}} to the episode as [...] "decent". Jill Mader from InsidePulse called the episode [...] "decent" [...] noting that [...] " [...] season has been shaping up." [...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic noted that the episode was not a [...] "fantastic episode of The Office, but it had its funny moments, and that's what I tune in for." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt wrote [...] "Doomsday" [...] was not [...] "a terrible episode by any means [...] the various pieces never fell into place, and the resolution didn't feel {{as though it was}} earned by the episode that came before it. It just felt like it was trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>too</b> much too quickly, never quite narrowing in on character in the midst of manufacturing chaos." [...] McNutt ultimately gave the episode a B-. Despite some of the more mixed reviews, a large majority of critics found the cold-opening humorous, with many noting that it was the best of the season so far.|$|E
500|$|In 1981, Christgau {{stated that}} {{although}} few critics agreed with Goldstein {{at the time}} of his negative contemporary review, many later came to appreciate his sentiments. In the opinion of Lester Bangs – the so-called [...] "godfather" [...] of punk rock journalism, also writing in 1981 – [...] "Goldstein was right in his much-vilified review... predicting that this record had the power to almost singlehandedly destroy rock and roll." [...] He notes: [...] "In the sixties rock and roll began to think of itself as an 'art form'. Rock and roll is not an 'art form'; rock and roll is a raw wail from the bottom of the guts." [...] The musicologist John Kimsey cites the preservation of authenticity as a guiding tenet of rock music and suggests that many purists denounce Sgt. Pepper in that respect, accusing the album of [...] "mark a fall from primal grace into pretense, production and self-consciousness." [...] In his opinion, detractors regard the LP as less a breakthrough and more a [...] "break with all that's good, true and rocking". According to Christgau: [...] "Although Sgt. Pepper is thought of as the most influential of all rock masterpieces, it is really only the most famous. In retrospect it seems peculiarly apollonian – precise, controlled, even stiff – and it is clearly peripheral to the rock mainstream". In Moore's estimation, [...] "because its cultural impact was so large, it was simply being asked <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>too</b> much." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Gethsemane" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Lon Grahnke of Chicago Sun-Times reacted positively toward the episode, {{calling it a}} [...] "stunning" [...] season finale. Paula Vitaris, writing for Cinefantastique, rated [...] "Gethsemane" [...] two stars out of four, noting that it [...] "withholds so much information that it barely qualifies as a complete episode". Vitaris felt that the large degree of ambiguity in the episode's script left the actors' performances [...] "curiously neutral", adding that the cast [...] "struggle manfully" [...] with the material. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen rated the episode a B+, noting that [...] "everything here has a ring of familiarity to it". Handlen felt that the episode's premise and ending were poorly executed, as [...] "trying to balance possible truths while maintaining the plausibility of both is incredibly difficult to pull off on a long-running show", adding that the episode [...] "comes down on the only {{side of the fence}} it really could" [...] given that [...] "there've been too many scenes of shape-changing bounty hunters and mystical alien healers to really let this idea play out know [...] in any real way". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, noting that while it [...] "attempts <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>too</b> much", it [...] "has a passion behind it which makes it gripping". Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode's cliffhanger ending, centering on the apparent death of Mulder, was too unbelievable, noting that it would be out of character for him to grow so disillusioned as to take his own life. In the 1999 FX Thanksgiving Marathon, containing fan-selected episodes, [...] "Gethsemane" [...] (along with [...] "Redux" [...] and [...] "Redux II") was presented as the [...] "Best Mythology Episode".|$|E

500|$|... "Kill Switch" [...] {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. Francis Dass of New Straits Times was positive toward the episode, calling it [...] "excellent". John Keegan of Critical Myth gave the episode an 8 out of 10, and wrote [...] "Overall, this episode puts Gibson’s genre credibility {{to good use}} by taking standard concepts of cyberpunk and applying them to the series." [...] He did note that there are [...] "a few minor characterization issues", and that [...] "not all of the concepts are pulled together as tightly as they could be", but other than those points, he concluded that it was [...] "solid and [...] enjoyable". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. [...] The two wrote that its themes were [...] "fresh and new" [...] and that the plot had [...] "real heart to it"." [...] Shearman and Pearson wrote positively of Mulder's virtual experiencing, praising [...] "kickboxing Scully" [...] and calling her [...] "supercool". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ and wrote that, while [...] "William Gibson’s cyberpunk milieu wouldn’t necessarily {{seem to be the}} best fit for The X-Files", the episode [...] "weirdly benefits from the lack of staff oversight." [...] He noted that it featured many elements to its plot, but was [...] "a rare example of an X-Files episode that works, even though it tries <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>too</b> much." [...] VanDerWerff was complimentary towards the story and called it [...] "propulsive"; he was particularly praise-worthy of the fact that Scully was featured heavily in the episode. He cited the scene wherein a virtual Scully roundhouse kicks a group of nurses {{as one of the best}} shots in the episode, and called it a [...] "hysterical moment". Brett Love of TV Squad stated that it is his favorite episode of The X-Files, considering it a [...] "great story" [...] and describing it as a [...] "tough one to beat". Paula Vitaris of Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's directing and noted that the entry was [...] "a great improvement over The X-Files earlier A.I. episode, first season's [...] "Ghost in the Machine". Vitaris cited [...] "Mulder's virtual experience" [...] as the [...] "highlight of the episode".|$|E
2500|$|Initial reviews {{immediately}} following the film's debut at the Edinburgh International Film Festival were generally positive.

2500|$|The series {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} television sources and critics. One review from Brian Lowry of Variety explained {{it contains a}} [...] "kind of crazed energy and inventiveness that isn't associated often enough with girl-oriented children's fare [...] opts for a more elevated approach– like that aforementioned roller-coaster jaunt, taking a free-spirited jump off the tracks and trusting its audience to hang on for the ride." [...] David Hinckley of Daily News gave the show four stars, while writing that The Mighty B! [...] "has a decent shot at becoming a pre-tween fave." [...] Aaron H. Bynum of Animation Insider called the series a [...] "good, brainless cartoon [...] viewers shouldn't ever be bored with Bessie," [...] but criticized part of its humor for not [...] "try <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>too</b> much, which may ultimately work against it when the story calls for the characters <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>too</b> little.|$|E

2500|$|Isabella Akinseye of Nolly Silver Screen gave a mixed review; while {{praising the}} {{cinematography}} and generally the production, she talked {{down on the}} plot and scripting.

2500|$|Game Revolution's Johnny Liu {{awarded the}} game a C. He was {{critical}} of the core platformer gameplay; [...] "the platform events come off as a standard, undisguised item hunt."

[...] He concluded [...] "Though it's admirably ambitious, Haven is crippled by trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>too</b> much.

2500|$|In {{his review}} in the New York Times, Bosley Crowther wrote that the film [...] "has been so sharply reduced in scope {{from what it was}} in the novel and the {{backgrounds}} of its people have been so pruned that it fails to explain the whys of their troubles, into the middle of which we're suddenly thrown. This appears to be the fault of the writer-director, Philip Dunne.

2500|$|Barbed wire was cut, the German fortifications [...] "exceptionally" [...] {{damaged and}} a crude form of {{creeping}} barrage preceded the infantry to their objectives. Harris held Haig {{responsible for the}} extension of the objectives in the north to the German second position, which diluted the density of British artillery-fire, although because no study had been made of the details of the preliminary bombardment, caution must accompany a conclusion that bombardment of the closer objectives was unduly dissipated. Harris concluded that the attack front was too broad and that Rawlinson should be held responsible with Haig, for attempting to advance on a [...] front. Despite being under no diplomatic pressure from the French or political pressure from London to obtain swift success, the British tried <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>too</b> much too quickly, unlike the French Sixth Army which made short advances with the support of massive amounts of artillery-fire.|$|E
2500|$|The {{coaching}} {{began to}} be criticized after a pair of midseason losses to the Minnesota Vikings and Denver Broncos. Denver players stated that shutting down Jimmie Giles {{was all it took}} to stop the Buccaneer offense, while the defense was still vulnerable to a short-yardage, ball-control attack. McKay felt that the team had become an [...] "aerial circus" [...] and that Williams' performance was being affected by trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>too</b> much, and so made a decision to establish a running game, taking over playcalling responsibilities on running plays. Having lost 4 of their last 5 games, there was concern that, about to face a Green Bay Packers team on a three-game win streak, the Buccaneers were about to repeat the late-season slides of the last three seasons. After breaking their two-game losing streak by routing the Packers, the Buccaneers demonstrated a newfound ability to continue to stick to and execute their game plan when playing with a deficit. Quarterbacks coach Bill Nelsen correctly predicted that the Buccaneers' performance against the Packers would cause the Vikings to underestimate the Packers, and thus lose their matchup the following week. Nelsen admonished the team not to miss a chance to take charge of the division, and they responded with an uncharacteristic rebound from a 14-point deficit against the Saints. A Week 14 last-minute victory over the Atlanta Falcons, combined with upset losses by the Lions and Vikings the same day, left the Buccaneers needing to win only one of their last two games to make the playoffs. They were one of only five teams in Week 15 who were capable of winning a division championship without help from another team. The season ended with a matchup against the Detroit Lions in front of a Pontiac Silverdome-record crowd of 80,444, with the Buccaneers and Lions tied for the division lead at 8–7. A season-ending New York Giants win against the Dallas Cowboys left the Giants at 9–7, guaranteeing that the winner of the Buccaneers-Lions game would win the division (the Packers were still in contention, but required an improbable set of circumstances that included a Buccaneers-Lions tie), while the loser would miss the playoffs entirely. Although the Lions outplayed the Buccaneers in most statistical categories, numerous Buccaneers stepped forward with key plays at crucial moments in the game, resulting in an upset victory. A crowd of over 8,000 gathered at team headquarters to greet them on their return from Detroit. The Buccaneers traveled to Dallas for a matchup with the Cowboys, where they suffered an embarrassing 38–0 shutout.|$|E
