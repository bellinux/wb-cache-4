25|$|Although {{porpoising}} is {{a useful}} product of rapid swimming, a lot of variation seen in the behaviour cannot be explained by this cause alone; it has likely evolved to provide other functions. For example, the rotation during porpoising by the spinner dolphin leads <b>to</b> <b>lots</b> of splashing and is more common at slower speeds so cannot be attributed to an energy saving mechanism. It is therefore {{more likely to be}} a form of play or communication within or between pods. Another reason might be to remove barnacles or small sharks such as remoras that, when attached, increase drag during swimming. When spinner dolphins impact the water the combination of centrifugal and vertical force upon these ectoparasites can be up to 700 times their own weight and so efficiently remove them. Other theories suggest that cetaceans may porpoise in order to observe distant objects such as food by looking for visual cues, such as birds dive-bombing a bait ball. Research into the additional functions of porpoising has so far been focussed on the more acrobatic species, but it is likely that other cetaceans also use it for these, and perhaps unknown, reasons too.|$|E

[...] The film earned a 1.4% rating when it aired in NTV on October 15, 2012. Marcus Doidge of DVD Active gave it a 6/10 stating, [...] "Solid State Society isn't {{as strong as the}} first and second season of the anime show but being one feature length story as opposed <b>to</b> <b>lots</b> of very cool and largely great individual episodes offers a more in depth and focused story for the most part and a happy return to the world of Ghost in the Shell".

500|$|When Robbie {{first began}} filming, {{she was told}} that Donna was bisexual. Of this Robbie said, [...] "In one of the blocks she is talking to Bridget about their 'first time' and Donna asks Bridget if {{it was with a}} guy or girl? I liked the way the writers {{conveyed}} that, it was just really subtle and they didn't make a big coming out scene of it. I think it's a good message to send out because it's not such a big deal <b>to</b> <b>lots</b> of people. Not all of them have such drama surrounding it". Donna's first storyline that included this aspect of her character was a kiss between herself and fellow female character, Sunny Lee (Hany Lee). The kiss occurs after Donna discovers that Sunny has been writing the romantic love letters given to her by her boyfriend. Sunny is shocked when Donna leans over and kisses her on the lips, as it is her first kiss. The show's producers called the kiss between Sunny and Donna as [...] "impulsive" [...] and Robbie agreed saying [...] "It's really not a big deal at all. It's not an actual gay storyline, it's just kind of an impulsive peck". The storyline came weeks after rival soap Home and Away endured a backlash to its own same-sex romance.|$|E

This paper {{reports on the}} variations in average velocity of four different lots of Hodgdon Extreme Varget tested in two. 223 Remington loads. Compared <b>to</b> the <b>lot</b> with the slowest average velocity, the other three lots of powder had higher average velocities ranging from 23. 4 ft/s faster up to 45. 6 ft/s faster with a 69 grain Nosler Custom Competition bullet and from 7. 9 ft/s faster to 15. 3 ft/s with the 53 grain Hornady VMAX. The mean velocity differences between lots are slightly correlated between the two loads with a correlation coefficient of 0. 54. This correlation suggests that factors other than <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>lot</b> variations contribute significantly to the measured velocity variations.

2500|$|In March 2015, Black {{expanded}} on {{her views}} in a talk to Investors In People.

When I did the independent review on sickness absence for the government, I talked <b>to</b> <b>lots</b> {{of people who}} were collecting their sicknotes and what they said is: 'I hate my line manager. I'm never going back to that job'. But no GP I've ever known writes anything other than a 'medical' diagnosis; the closest they get is 'stress' or 'anxiety' - often not the truth at all". At the same time she drew a sharp distinction between what she called [...] "real" [...] illnesses such as [...] "cancer", [...] "diabetes" [...] and [...] "endogenous depression", and other phenomena such as [...] "stress, anxiety, and mild depression", which she claimed were characterised by [...] "little or no objective disease or impairment" [...] and were [...] "not serious illnesses".

2500|$|Most {{mechanistic}} {{approaches to}} species abundance distributions use niche-space, i.e. available resources, as the mechanism driving abundances. If {{species in the}} same trophic level consume the same resources (such as nutrients or sunlight in plant communities, prey in carnivore communities, nesting locations or food in bird communities) and these resources are limited, how the resource [...] "pie" [...] is divided among species determines how many individuals of each species can exist in the community. Species with access <b>to</b> <b>lots</b> of resources will have higher carrying capacities than those with little access. Mutsunori Tokeshi later elaborated niche apportionment theory to include niche filling in unexploited resource space. Thus, a species may survive in the community by carving out a portion of another species' niche (slicing up the pie into smaller pieces) or by moving into a vacant niche (essentially making the pie larger, for example, by being {{the first to arrive}} in a newly available location or through the development of a novel trait that allows access previously unavailable resources). Numerous niche apportionment models have been developed. Each make different assumptions about how species carve up niche-space.|$|E
2500|$|... "Certainly, {{the fact}} that the game was going to be set ten years after the first BioShock {{established}} the atmosphere of BioShock 2," [...] he recalled. [...] "I really wanted the ambience to sell {{the fact that}} Rapture was constantly falling apart around the player." [...] In addition <b>to</b> <b>lots</b> of creaking and groaning sounds to accentuate the setting's disrepair, Kamper and the audio team added non-diegetic sounds that grow in frequency the closer the player gets {{to the end of the}} game to convey the mounting insanity of the Splicers. The Big Sister's sound effects were created by layering sounds from birds, hyenas, and Kamper's wife doing impressions of a dolphin. The audio team spent a great deal of time on immersing the player in their role of a Big Daddy through the audio—everything from the sound of the footsteps to the sounds for impacts and water drips on the player's armor was used to sell the player on who their character was. Audio programmer Guy Somberg created a background sound system that allowed the team to layer stereo sounds together depending on the player's location, combined with mono sound effects for certain areas. [...] "This allowed us to quickly iterate on our ambiences and implement them into the levels with ease, and helped create the randomness I was looking for in the background effects," [...] Kamper recalled. Multiplayer sounds were handled by Digital Extremes, who along with Kamper's team had to make sure their sounds cohered not only with each other's work, but with the sounds of the first game.|$|E
