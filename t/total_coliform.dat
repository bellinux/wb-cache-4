500|$|The Jordan River {{has been}} a {{repository}} for waste since the settling of the Salt Lake Valley. For 100 years, raw, untreated sewage was dumped into the river; farming and animal runoff occurred; and mining operations led to 40 smelters being built and contaminating the river with heavy metals, mostly arsenic and lead. In 1962, the river in Midvale recorded a <b>total</b> <b>coliform</b> level of about 3 million per 100 milliliters, even though the state of Utah criteria for {{the total number of}} coliform bacteria in water samples should not exceed 5,000 per 100 milliliters.

2500|$|The 1989 EPA <b>Total</b> <b>Coliform</b> Rule (TCR) imposed major {{monitoring}} {{changes for}} public water systems. The testing requirements for drinking {{water under the}} TCR are markedly increased over previous requirements and thus are more thorough.

50|$|To {{comply with}} the EPA's <b>Total</b> <b>Coliform</b> Rule of 1990, the water bureau must collect and analyze at least 210 water samples each month from its {{distribution}} system. The rule requires that <b>total</b> <b>coliform</b> bacteria be absent in 95 percent of the samples; if a positive sample is found, three more samples must be collected and analyzed within 24 hours. Any positive Escherichia coli (E. coli) sample followed by a positive <b>total</b> <b>coliform</b> sample, or a positive <b>total</b> <b>coliform</b> sample followed by a positive E. coli sample {{is a violation of}} the <b>Total</b> <b>Coliform</b> Rule. In practice, following guidelines approved by the State of Oregon in 2005, the water bureau analyzes between 250 and 350 samples each month. Between 1990 and late November 2009, a total of 14 water samples tested positive for E. coli but all follow-up samples tested negative.|$|E
30|$|For instance, Zaqoot et al. (2016) {{recorded}} low to high <b>total</b> <b>coliforms</b> (1 – 100  cfu/ 100  ml) from {{tap water}} stored in storage tanks found in Palestine. Similarly, drinking water samples collected from different protected sources found in Wondo Genet were positive for <b>total</b> <b>coliforms</b> (Meride and Ayenew 2016). The study analyzed 1 – 4  cfu/ 100  ml of <b>total</b> <b>coliforms</b> {{in the water}} samples. <b>Total</b> <b>coliforms</b> (10  cfu/ 100  ml) were analyzed in the water samples used for drinking around Jimma Zone (Abera et al. 2011). The type of water, water treatment efficiency, handling practice, site and type of container could aid {{to the growth of}} microbes in treated water (Brick et al. 2004). The presence of <b>total</b> <b>coliforms</b> in each water sample collected from protected sources and storage tanks deviated from maximum permissible limits of the WHO. Hence, regular inspection is vital for a provision of microbially free drinking water to communities. According to WHO drinking water guidelines, <b>total</b> <b>coliforms</b> should not be detectable in any water intended for drinking (WHO 2006). Storage tank material and size has also a significance effect on the quality of stored water (Cynthia and Schafer 2012). According to one study, water stored in stainless steel tanks was more contaminated than plastic tanks (Aish 2013). Regarding the size, water stored in the large water storage tanks can be contaminated with <b>total</b> <b>coliforms</b> due to the longer storage times, which may potentially increase the risk of contamination and allow chlorine to volatilize (Graham and VanDerslice 2007).|$|R
30|$|<b>Total</b> <b>coliforms</b> include four genera, Escherichia sp., Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp. and Citrobacter sp. Some {{members of}} this group, e.g., Klebsiella sp. may grow in {{industrial}} waste. They are the historic indicators of faecal contamination since 100  years ago (Cooper and Olivieri 1998). <b>Total</b> <b>coliforms</b> {{are one of the}} best indicators for treatment efficiency of sewage treatment plants (Bitton 2005 b).|$|R

40|$|Bacteria in sea sediments play a {{fundamental}} role in organic matter decomposition, in several geochemistries transformations, in nutrient regeneration {{and as a}} nutritious source for the benthic fauna.

This study compared the performance of LMX® broth as an enzymatic assay with the standard methods multiple tube fermentation technique and presence–absence test, for the detection of indicator coliforms in drinking water samples.

Through both soil columns, fractions of staphylococci retained was in the order of 99. 99 % relative to the total staphylococci concentration deposited on top. For the whole bacteriological analysis, the fractions of <b>total</b> <b>coliforms</b> retained seems to be greater through deeper soil column than that of upper soil column.

Concentrations of various contaminants found in groundwater would be a tiny part, relative to quantities deposited on soil surface. Bacterial retention potentials of soil column separating soil surface from groundwater table during wastewater percolation, varies along its transect.
