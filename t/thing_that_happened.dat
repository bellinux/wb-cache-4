University isn't for everyone and I discovered that the other writers I know didn't finish their courses either. It was certainly the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to me." ...|$|E

The artists were allowed to position themselves. Hedda Sterne, who had arrived late, {{is seen in the}} back (standing on a table). She is the only woman in the photograph and would later describe the experience as [...] "probably the worst <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to me". Painter Lee Krasner believed Sterne was allowed at the insistence of art dealer Betty Parsons, who represented many in the group.|$|E
500|$|Despite Coveleski's {{success in}} Cleveland, {{he was not}} a fan of playing there; he stated that he [...] "didn't like the town. Now the people are all right, but I just didn't like the town." [...] He also stated that it began to affect his {{performance}} on the mound, and that he began to get [...] "lazy" [...] from being with the club so long. He did, however, have praise for his catcher: [...] "The best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to me there was pitching to Steve O'Neill. He caught me for nine years in Cleveland and knew me so well he didn't even need to give me a sign".|$|E
500|$|In a December 2012 interview, Winkelman {{expressed}} some regret {{about what}} had happened.

[...] "Do I think it was right? No. Do I think it was a great <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to Wimbledon? No... I don’t feel in the right over the way this club was born. But I don’t think I could live with myself if I hadn't gone out and bought the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito... What happened was my fault, and I have to take responsibility for it. But I don’t see why my players, staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness, it's nothing to do with them." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{scenes that}} {{featured}} Rachel's party were acclaimed by most reviewers. Fallon called them [...] "a parade {{of the funniest}} sight gags, most uninhibited acting, and—interestingly enough—most relatable scenes Glee has produced in a while", and described Michele as [...] "an acting stand out" [...] who [...] "handled the entire arc like a seasoned comedienne". His colleague Meghan Brown said it [...] "showed Glee at its best", and added: [...] "The dialogue was snappy, the group dynamic was clean and specific, and the kids seemed like actual kids." [...] VanDerWerff {{also pointed out that}} the club members [...] "really felt like kids, not like miniature 30-somethings", and said the party was the [...] "best part" [...] of the episode. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone praised Finn's breakdown of [...] "the five drunk girl archetypes, as demonstrated by the glee girls". Harper wrote that the party scenes [...] "left a lot to be desired", and Patrick Burns, the third reviewer from The Atlantic, [...] "waited for the Glee party to get out of control, or for someone to get hurt so that America's youth could be shocked and appalled by the dangers of drinking", but [...] "the worst <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> was that Rachel tried to flip a gay guy".|$|E
500|$|Singer {{described}} the Apt Pupils premise as a [...] "study in cruelty". He {{prepared for the}} film by reading books like the 1996 history book Hitler's Willing Executioners, which confirmed his beliefs that Nazi war criminals felt [...] "guiltless and matter-of-fact about what they did". He referred to how young Todd Bowden's interactions with Nazi war criminal Kurt Dussander start to affect him: [...] "I {{liked the idea of}} the infectious nature of evil... The notion that anybody has the capacity within them to be cruel if motivated properly is, I think, a scary concept." [...] The director also perceived the film as not about the Holocaust, believing that the Nazi war criminal could have been replaced by one of Pol Pot's executioners or a mass murderer from Russia. [...] "It wasn't about fascism or National Socialism. It was about cruelty and the ability to do awful deeds, to live with them and be empowered by them," [...] Singer said. To this end, the director sought to avoid overt use of swastikas and other Nazi symbols. He was also attracted to the film as [...] " [...] idea that the collective awfulness of this terrible <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> decades ago in Europe had somehow crept up across the ocean and through time, like a golem, into this beautiful Southern California suburban neighborhood".|$|E
500|$|Although Cherry {{points out}} that Chamberlain was an egotist, {{he added that he}} had good {{relationships}} with many contemporaries and enjoyed a great deal of respect. He was especially lauded for his good rapport with his fans, often providing tickets and signing autographs. Dr. Jack Ramsay recalled that Chamberlain regularly took walks in downtown Philadelphia and acknowledged honking horns with the air of a man enjoying all the attention. Jerry West called him a [...] "complex... very nice person", and NBA rival Jack McMahon even said: [...] "The best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to the NBA is that God made Wilt a nice person... he could have killed us all with his left hand." [...] Celtics contemporary Bob Cousy even assumed that if Chamberlain had been less fixated on being popular, he would have been meaner and able to win more titles. During most of his NBA career, Chamberlain was good friends with Bill Russell. Chamberlain often invited Russell over to Thanksgiving, and at Russell's place, conversation mostly concerned Russell's electric trains. But as the championship count became increasingly lopsided, the relationship got strained, and turned hostile after Russell accused Chamberlain of [...] "copping out" [...] in the notorious Game 7 of the 1969 NBA Finals. The two men did not talk to each other for over 20 years, until Russell apologized privately, then publicly in a 1997 joint interview with Bob Costas: [...] "There was a thing almost 30 years ago... I was wrong." [...] Still, Chamberlain maintained a level of bitterness, regretted that he should have been [...] "more physical" [...] with Russell in their games and privately continued accusing his rival for [...] "intellectualizing" [...] basketball in a negative way.|$|E

Bäckman was an independent candidate for European Parliament election in 2009 on the Workers Party of Finland list. He got 554 votes and was not allocated a seat.|$|E

[...] Briefly, Kudrow joined with Conan O'Brien and director Tim Hillman in the short-lived improv troupe Unexpected Company.

2500|$|During {{training}} in Zaire, Foreman suffered a cut above his eye, forcing postponement {{of the match}} for a month. The injury affected his training regimen, as it meant he could not spar in the build-up to the fight and risk the cut being re-opened. He later commented: [...] "That was the best <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to Ali {{when we were in}} Africa—the fact that I had {{to get ready for the}} fight without being able to box." [...] Foreman later also claimed he was drugged by his trainer prior to the bout. Ali used this time to tour Zaire, endearing himself to the public while taunting Foreman at every opportunity. Foreman was favored, having knocked out both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton within two rounds.|$|E
2500|$|During early {{conceptions of}} the album, Norwood had wanted to re-unite with Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins – her {{longtime}} collaborator who had executive-produced Human (2008). However mid-way through 2009, during an interview with Out magazine, Norwood refused to talk about Human, telling interviews [...] "to hell with that album" [...] when questions were asked about it. It wasn't until 2010 when Norwood would break her silence during an episode of her VH1 reality TV show Brandy and Ray J: A Family Business. During one of the episodes when her brother Ray J announces {{that he wants to}} work with Darkchild, Norwood reveals that she felt the producer [...] "did not put his all into the album", and that [...] "was a personal issue between me and him." [...] Elaborating on what she meant, Norwood replied [...] "You know what kind of chemistry Rodney and I have too, but on some personal issues, he doesn't deliver.....I don't want the same <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to me, to happen to you.".|$|E

Opinion around the NHL in the early 1980s was that Swedish players were [...] "soft"; teammate Colin Patterson credited Loob with changing that perception. [...] He was a vocal leader, unafraid to speak to his teammates when he felt it necessary. [...] He was a strong skater with [...] "dazzling technique", and former Calgary linemate Joe Nieuwendyk said Loob was a key reason for his own early success in the NHL: [...] "He just had such a great amount of skill. He could do things none of the rest of us could. The luckiest <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> <b>happened</b> to me was getting put on Hakan Loob’s line my first full year in Calgary. He helped me so much, starting my career the right way. A big reason why I scored 50." [...] Nieuwendyk added that Loob could [...] "put pucks into areas, make plays, nobody else would dream of".|$|E
