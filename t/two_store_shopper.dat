40|$|Perishability, {{a largely}} unconsidered {{characteristic}} of consumer goods, {{is shown to}} play an important role in planned multistore shopping behavior. We present a model of consumers as cost minimizing inventory managers, who choose between <b>two</b> <b>stores</b> differentiated on location and price, and who purchase perishable and nonperishable goods. We show that the interaction between perishability of goods and price differences of stores can be an important driving force for planned multistore shopping. This rationale leads to a set of propositions. One unexpected result is that as the known price difference on a basket of identical goods increases between <b>two</b> <b>stores,</b> <b>shoppers</b> making <b>store</b> choice decisions on the basis of the basket price are more likely to shop regularly at both stores. We present survey results supporting our model's predictions...|$|R

Segmenting makes it possible to target marketing measures at the most profitable shoppers.The value of segmenting shoppers is debated in the shopper marketing industry. For retailers it can provide direction on positioning relative to competitors as well as in terms of store locations. Loyalty cards can provide one of the richest sources of segmentation data.

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The {{present study}} {{examined}} the influence of country-of- origin on the apparel purchase decision. One-hundred and eighty-one adult female sweater purchasers were surveyed directly following {{the purchase of a}} sweater for personal use in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area. The sample consisted of 138 department <b>store</b> <b>shoppers</b> and 43 discount <b>store</b> <b>shoppers.</b> Country-of-origin and price information were recorded from the garments purchased while respondents completed questionnaires. A semantic differential scale was used to measure the importance of country-of-origin and the following purchase criteria in the decision to purchase a sweater: fit, designer label/brand name, expected durability, color, warmth/coolness properties, ease of care, fashion, store, price, quality of workmanship, coordinates with wardrobe, fiber content, feel of garment, and style/design. On {{a scale of one to}} seven, country-of-origin received the lowest mean importance score of the purchase criteria with a score of 2. 40. This mean was significantly lower in importance than all other criteria except designer label/ brand name. Fit, color, and coordinates with existing wardrobe received the highest mean importance scores, each above 6. 25. Findings revealed that only 17 percent of the respondents were aware of garment origin at the time of purchase. A significantly greater proportion of purchasers of U. S. made sweaters (23. 9 %) were aware of garment origin than were purchasers of imported sweaters (12. 5 %). Other significant findings showed country-of-origin to be most important to: purchasers of U. S. made sweaters; purchasers aware of a garment's origin; sweater purchasers over 50 years of age; and homemakers. However, even for these groups mean importance scores for country-of-origin remained low. Importance ratings for country-of-origin were not found to differ significantly on the basis of education, income, price paid, or store type. In conclusion, country-of-origin was not found to be an important criterion compared to other purchase criteria that influence the decision to buy a sweater, although a limited number of purchasers did notice garment origin and considered U. S. origin to be an important factor in the apparel purchase decision...|$|R

40|$|The study’s {{research}} model {{suggests that}} store design {{and ease of}} shopping are associated with customer retention through a mediated pathway in which store design and ease of shopping influence perceived store satisfaction, which in turn, influences customer retention. This survey was administered to <b>two</b> separate clothing <b>stores</b> offered to either females or males (in total, 533 participants). Using structural equation modelling methodology, data was analysed to explain the interrelations among the variables in the model. The results of an empirical study of a sample of <b>store</b> <b>shoppers</b> revealed that <b>store</b> design and ease of shopping influence customer retention {{in an indirect way}} through customer perception of satisfaction with the store. In building store satisfaction that is centred on customer retention, store design and shopping ease differ in their relative influences. This difference is high for females, but for men as low as to be considered negligible in males. As a result, improving customers’ perceptions of store design and ease of shopping is a way to ensure store satisfaction support customer retention. The results of the study provide a new insight into the relationships by suggesting indirect effects of shopping ease and store design on consumer retention by their impacts on store satisfaction, rather than direct effects. </p...|$|R

40|$|When a product's price fluctuates at a store, {{how should}} rational, cost-minimizing shoppers shop for it? Specifically, how {{frequently}} should they visit the store, {{and how much}} of the product should they buy when they get there? Would this rational shopping behavior differ across Every Day Low Price (EDLP) and Promotional Pricing (HILO) <b>stores?</b> If <b>shoppers</b> are rational, which retail price format is more profitable, EDLP or HILO? To answer these questions, we develop a normative model that shows how rational customers should shop when the price of the product is random. We derive a closed-form expression for the optimal purchasing policy and show that the optimal quantity to purchase under a given price scenario is linearly decreasing in the difference between the price under that scenario and the average price. This purchase flexibility due to price variability has a direct impact on shopping frequency. Indeed, the benefit of this purchase flexibility can be captured via an "option value" that implicitly reduces the fixed cost associated with each shopping trip. Consequently, rational shoppers should shop more often and buy fewer units per trip when they face higher price variability. Our results suggest that if <b>two</b> <b>stores</b> charge the same average price for a product, rational shoppers incur a lower level of expenditure at the store with a higher price variability. Since stores with different price variabilities coexist in practice, we expect stores with higher price variability to charge a higher average price. Thus, given <b>two</b> <b>stores,</b> a higher relative mean price for a given item should be indicative of higher price variability, and vice versa. These model implications are tested using multicategory scanner panel data from 513 households and pricing data for three <b>stores</b> (<b>two</b> EDLP <b>stores</b> and one HILO store) and 33 product categories over a two-year period. We find strong empirical support for the model implications. Rational Shopping, EDLP, HILO, Retail Pricing Format...|$|R
