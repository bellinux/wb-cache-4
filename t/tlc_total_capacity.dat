40|$|Abstract Background In this study, we {{analyzed}} maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximal expiratory pressure (MEP) values {{in a stable}} COPD population compared with normal subjects. We evaluated the possible correlation between functional maximal respiratory static pressures and functional and anthropometric parameters {{at different stages of}} COPD. Furthermore, we considered the possible correlation between airway obstruction and MIP and MEP values. Subject and methods 110 patients with stable COPD and 21 age-matched healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Patients were subdivided according to GOLD guidelines: 31 mild, 39 moderate and 28 severe. Results Both MIP and MEP were lower in patients with severe airway impairment than in normal subjects. Moreover, we found a correlation between respiratory muscle function and some functional and anthropometric parameters: FEV 1 (forced expiratory volume in one second), FVC (forced vital capacity), PEF (peak expiratory flow), <b>TLC</b> (<b>total</b> lung <b>capacity)</b> and height. MIP and MEP values were lower in patients with severe impairment than in patients with a slight reduction of FEV 1. Conclusion The measurement of MIP and MEP indicates the state of respiratory muscles, thus providing clinicians with a further and helpful tool in monitoring the evolution of COPD. </p...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAim of the studyThe {{diffusion}} {{capacity of}} the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is an important tool in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with pulmonary diseases. In case of a decreased DLCO the KCO, defined as DLCO/VA (VA is alveolar volume), can differentiate between normal alveolocapillary membrane (normal KCO) and abnormal alveolocapillary membrane (low KCO). The latter category consists of decreased surface of the membrane, increased thickness or decreased perfusion of ventilated alveoli. The VA/TLC (<b>TLC</b> is <b>total</b> lung <b>capacity</b> determined by whole body plethysmography) can partially differentiate between these categories. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the diagnostic value of the specific diffusion disturbances, which can be constructed by combining the DLCO, KCO and VA/TLC. MethodsIn 460 patients the diagnosis made by clinicians were fitted into five diagnostic categories: asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), treatment effects of haematologic malignancies, heart failure and diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLD). These categories were linked to the pattern of diffusion disturbance. ResultsAlmost all patients with asthma have a normal DLCO, most patients in the other groups do not have the expected pattern of diffusion disturbance, especially in the group with DPLD a bad match is observed. ConclusionIn this study the pattern of diffusion disturbance is of limited use in establishing a diagnosis. The use of the KCO next to the DLCO has no additional diagnostic value. Regional ventilation–perfusion inequality probably forms an important underlying mechanism of decreased DLCO...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The {{degradation}} due {{to complete}} asynchronism (at the codeword and symbol levels) in the <b>total</b> <b>capacity,</b> maximum rate-sum, of white Gaussian multiple-access channels is investi-gated. It is shown that asynchronism reduces the <b>total</b> <b>capacity</b> of a K-user channel by {{at most a}} factor of K. Moreover, this bound is achieved, in asymptotically high signal-to-noise ratios, by the TDMA signalling strategy. When the signalling strategies are optimally designed to maximize the asynchronous <b>total</b> <b>capacity</b> under bandwidth constraints, we find that in a two-user channel 1) for a certain set of signal-to-noise ratios there is no degradation due to asynchronism, 2) for any bandwidth and signal-to-noise ratios the asynchronous <b>total</b> <b>capacity</b> is at least 88 % of the synchronous <b>total</b> <b>capacity,</b> and 3) asynchronism has a vanishing small effect on <b>total</b> <b>capacity</b> for both low and high signal-to-noise ratios...|$|R
