50|$|However, {{this is a}} {{theoretical}} approach {{as the level of}} insulation of a building affects the demand for heating. For example, temperatures often drop below the base <b>temperature</b> <b>during</b> <b>night</b> (daily low temperature in diurnal variation), but because of insulation, heating is unnecessary. In the end of spring and in the beginning of fall or in the winter depending on the climate, sufficient insulation keeps the indoor temperature higher than the outdoor temperature with little or no heating. For example in southern California, during winter heating is not necessary in Los Angeles and San Diego if the insulation is sufficient {{to take into account the}} colder night temperatures. Also, buildings include thermal mass such as concrete, that is able to store energy of the sun absorbed in daytime. Thus, even if the heating degree days indicate a demand for heating sufficient insulation of a building can make heating unnecessary.|$|E

As many factors can be {{the causes of the}} accidents in winter season, road freezing is the most important factor among them. Even though the road surface temperature is more important than air temperature, generally the drivers and road manager get the air temperature from the weather forecast. If a road manager has information or can predict the road surface condition or temperature, the accidents related with road surface freezing could be reduced. In this study, a thermal mapping system was developed to measure road surface temperatures. And the road surface temperature (RST) and air temperature were measured along the various road segmentations such as normal road sections, bridges, tunnels and cut slope sections. As a result, although the RST in normal paved road sections was higher than air <b>temperature</b> <b>during</b> <b>night</b> time, the RST in bridges and cut slope sections was lower than air temperature. Moreover, the average RST in bridges and cut slope sections showed lower values than in normal paved road sections.

40|$|Co-existing {{species at}} the same trophic level often {{segregate}} with respect to diet, habitat use, or spatial distribution, reducing their direct competition for resources. However, temporal patterns in species-specific habitat use, for instance due to climatic variation, may affect the strength of interspecific interactions, and generate temporal variation in niche partitioning. We assessed temporal variation in habitat overlap between a wild ungulate, moose Alces alces, and two freeranging domestic ungulates, sheep Ovis aries and cattle Bos taurus, on a boreal forest range in southern Norway. We also calculated the distance between species' realised niches, {{as well as the}} width of their realised niches to evaluate the extent of temporal niche partitioning under different diurnal weather conditions. Analyses of each habitat variable suggested complex relationships between species-specific habitat use, photoperiod, and weather, related to species-specific behaviour and activity patterns. We found shorter overall niche distance between moose and sheep, compared to moose and cattle, and shorter niche distances during day and night than during the twilight hours. The niche distance between moose and sheep was positively related to <b>temperature</b> <b>during</b> <b>night,</b> but negatively during day. Moreover, niche distance between moose and both sheep and cattle was negatively related to precipitation at daytime. Moose niche width was narrower in periods with short niche distance to sheep, while we did not find such pattern towards cattle. A lack of similar moose response to cattle could be attributed to lower niche overlap between moose and cattle. Our results suggest that temporal niche partitioning between moose and livestock breaks down under the weather conditions that are predicted to become more common as climate change, potentially increasing wildlife-livestock interactions in the future...|$|E

Materials and Methods: A total of 1793 records (946 White Giant and 847 Soviet Chinchilla) for weight at mating (WM), weight at kindling (WK), gestation length (GL), litter size at birth (LSB) and litter size at weaning (LSW), litter weight at birth (LWB), and litter weight at weaning (LWW) were collected in the period between 2000 and 2009 and the data was analyzed using general linear model option of SAS 9. 2. Results: The overall mean GL, WM, WK, LSB, LSW, LWB, and LWW were 31. 68 ± 0. 04 days, 3. 65 ± 0. 01 kg, 3. 84 ± 0. 01 kg, 6. 91 ± 0. 08, 5. 49 ± 0. 09, 387. 62 ± 4. 07 g, and 4. 66 ± 0. 07 kg, respectively. The breed has significantly influenced GL, WK, LSW, LWB, and LWW. The LSB, LSW, LWB, and LWW were 7. 05 ± 0. 11, 5. 76 ± 0. 13, 399. 55 ± 5. 88 g, and 4. 87 ± 0. 10 kg, respectively in White Giant and corresponding values for Soviet Chinchilla were 6. 78 ± 0. 11, 5. 22 ± 0. 12, 375. 91 ± 5. 64 g, and 4. 46 ± 0. 09 kg, respectively. The year of kindling had significantly affected all the reproductive traits under study and is varying over different years. The parity significantly influenced the WM, WK, and LWW. The LWW increased from first (4. 16 ± 0. 21 kg) to second parity (4. 86 ± 0. 19 kg) and remained in the same range from third parity onward. WM was significantly higher in spring season (3. 72 ± 0. 02) than the animals in rainy (3. 59 ± 0. 02) and winter season (3. 65 ± 0. 02). Better reproductive performance in terms of higher LSB, LSW, LWB, and LWW as observed in the present study might be due to conducive environmental conditions prevailing in the region. Conclusion: The significant effects of the non-genetic factors like year of kindling on all reproductive traits, season, and parity on some of the traits in rabbit breeds are indications that any future production enhancement strategy must take into consideration the environment by providing additional care, feed supplementation and better shelter management to the rabbits, so that the full genetic potential can be realized...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} effects of different chilling treatments during the dormant season upon growth of Douglas-fir seedlings 0 In addition it was planned to determine whether seedlings native to various geographic areas differ in their chilling requirements 0 The hypotheses were advanced, based on previous studies, that chilling at near L& 00 F. was more effective in satisfying the chilling requirement of plants than chilling at temperatures near 32 °F., or 50 °F., and that plants native to areas of low elevation, characterized by mild winters, require less chilling than plants native to areas of high elevation characterized by long and severe winters. Verification or rejection of these hypotheses was undertaken by subjecting dormant seedlings of Douglas-fir, native to several geographic areas, to chilling under different temperature treatments for different lengths of time. Experiment I was designed to compare the effects of chilling for three, six, and twelve weeks at various temperatures (32, L& 0, 50, and 60 °F., and out-of-doors) on two-year-old seedlings from eight geographic areas. After chilling, they were moved to a warm greenhouse and exposed to short days (nine hours). The effectiveness of the treatments in breaking dormancy was expressed in number of days from end of treatment to bud burst, percentage of plants which broke dormancy, and amount of shoot elongation. In general 40 °F. was the most effective treatment followed by 32 °F., out-of-doors, 50, and 60 °F., in that order. The latter temperature had little or no effect in breaking dormancy compared with the other treatments. Twelve weeks of chilling were more effective than chilling for shorter periods at all temperatures except 60 °F. At six weeks 40 °F. was the most effective treatment, 32 °F. was less effective, while 50, 60 °F., and out-of- doors treatments were ineffective in breaking dormancy. Four weeks of chilling were ineffective regardless of the chilling treatment. Genetic differences were observed among the plants from the eight areas chilled at 40 °F. for twelve weeks. Plants native to the highest areas represented in the experiment resumed growth earlier than those from the lower elevations. Experiments II and III differed from Experiment I since the dormant seedlings had germinated and grown only about three months prior to chilling. In these experiments plants were chilled for four, eight, and twelve weeks. After the chilling period half of the plants were grown under long days (normal days plus two hours of artificial light) while the other half were maintained on short days (nine hours). The results of Experiment II were similar to those of Experiment I with respect to the greater effectiveness of 40 °F. compared with the other temperature 8. Long days seemed to compensate for lack of adequate chilling except in plants chilled for twelve weeks at 40 °F., indicating that the chilling requirements of these plants had been more adequately satisfied than by any of the other treatments. Experiment III was designed to compare the effectiveness of chilling under fluctuating day and night temperatures with that of chilling at a constant temperature. Fluctuating day and night temperatures of 40 / 32 °F. (40 °F. day, 32 'F. night) were about as effective as continuous chilling at 32 °F. or 40 °F. Fluctuating temperatures of 50 / 32 °F., and 50 / 40 °F. appeared to be about as effective as continuous chilling at 50 °F. Chilling at 50 °F. during the day, irrespective of the <b>temperature</b> <b>during</b> <b>night,</b> delayed bud burst in comparison with chilling at 32, 40, or 40 / 32 °F.

40|$|During {{the last}} {{years there has been}} {{reported}} considerable and rapid contamination on newly built rendered façades in Sweden due to biological growth. The problem is believed to occur mostly on façades of render applied on thermal insulation, but apart from this it is difficult to find clear relationships indication which façades might be infected. The aim of this project is to explain why certain façades gets heavy biological growth while other seemingly similar do not. We will do that with comparing biological knowledge with building physical and -technical knowledge. One of the major approaches in this project is to investigate building façades. We have investigated several buildings with discolored façades, mostly in Skåne, the southern most part of Sweden, and tried to identify the organisms growing. The most dominating organisms we found growing on the façades were lichens and algae. In addition we have investigated building façades with organized patterns of small round areas where no growth occur on otherwise quite fouled façades. These small round areas appears then on the façade as “white dots”. Further investigations of the façades show that the “white dots” appear at each fastener placed under the rendering to fasten the thermal insulation to the structural wall behind. We believe that the fasteners are heat bridges, with higher outer surface temperature and therefore a lower surface relative humidity at which no microbial growth occurs. Results from computer simulations showed that the fasteners are heat bridges and in cases with thin layers of thermal insulation and rendering give a 1 - 2 K higher night-time temperatures {{than the rest of the}} façade which made a difference in relative humidity at 11 %. This small difference in temperature gives high enough differences in moisture state to almost prevent microbial growth above the fasteners. As we know that organisms need a high relative humidity to grow, these results could explain the uneven distribution of biological growth on the façades with “white dots”. Temperature and relative humidity measurements on façades of thin rendering on thermal insulation (light façades) and brick wall with rendering (heavy façades) shows that light façades are more directly influenced by the weather conditions than the heavy façades. The temperature varied much more on the light façades than the on the heavy façades; in a day of October 2005 the temperature varied from 60. 4 °C during daytime to - 0. 4 °C during the next night. During nights there is no difference between the lowest temperatures on the light façades on the south- and north-facing façades. The light façades gets colder in the night then the heavy façades due to the lower heat capacity in the construction, whereas the heavy façades with the higher heat capacity can store the heat from daytime during night. The red-colored façades, which had a higher temperature than the white-colored façades, have a significantly lower relative humidity with a difference of 20 % relative humidity if it was not fully overcast. The relative humidity during night on the south-facing façades shows that the white-colored heavy façade had a higher maximum relative humidity with approximately difference of 10 % relative humidity during night than the red-colored light façade in spite of the higher minimum <b>temperature</b> <b>during</b> <b>night</b> on the white-colored heavy façade. The results from the temperature measurements above the fasteners show that the fasteners are heat bridges that increase the façade surface a few degrees during night, but also in the winter on the north-facing façade during daytime. We will continue our measurements of temperature and relative humidity on heavy and light façades in addition with investigations of biological growth on both the above façades and on newly built light façades. Also biological growth will be studied on samples with thin rendering on thermal insulation where we will investigate different abiotic factors on the samples. By this we hope to understand the mineral façade as a biological habitat and learn more about the organisms living there and which abiotic and biotic factors that control the growth...|$|E

40|$|Yield {{reductions}} {{have been}} widely observed under water-saving irrigation in lowland rice. The yield gap has been related to decreases {{in the number of}} spikelets per panicle and decreased spikelet fertility. Since these yield components highly depend on the thermal environment of the meristem which is subjected to changes when a ponded water layer is omitted, the impact of irrigation system on yield components needs to be studied under consideration of temperature at meristem level. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} analyze yield and yield components of irrigated rice grown with and without a ponded water layer under consideration of effects of irrigation system on meristem temperature under field conditions. Field trials were conducted on two sites in Senegal, where rice was grown under flooded and non-flooded conditions with six staggered sowing dates between August 2009 and June 2010. Temperature was measured at meristem level and related to leaf area, yield and yield components of three different varieties (i. e. IR 64, Sahel 202 and N 22). Yield reductions under non-flooded conditions were mainly observed in the cold-dry season, whereas slight yield increase were found in the hot-wet season. Among the yield components, reduced number of spikelets per panicle and spikelet fertility accounted for the largest share of the yield gap. Meristem <b>temperature</b> <b>during</b> the <b>night</b> was always lower under non-flooded conditions and the temperature difference between irrigation treatments increased during the cold-dry season. Leaf area per tiller was linearly related to meristem temperature in the observed temperature range, and a linear relationship was found between leaf area per tiller and the number of spikelets per panicle. Furthermore, spikelet fertility increased with meristem temperature between panicle initiation and booting stage. Therefore, lower meristem temperature led to smaller leaf area per tiller, less spikelets per panicle and decreased fertility under non-flooded conditions. Without standing water, the rice plant's meristem will be exposed to lower <b>temperatures</b> <b>during</b> <b>night,</b> which can lead to significant yield reductions in areas where cool nights occur.

The results showed that coconut have the highest bed <b>temperature</b> <b>during</b> the day cycle with a mean of 77. 5 ℃ and the lowest mean <b>temperature</b> <b>during</b> the <b>night</b> cycle with a mean of 12. 9 ℃. In addition, it was found from the analysis that the coconut shell activated carbon has the highest coefficient of performance of 0. 25...|$|R
