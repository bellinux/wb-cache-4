500|$|After {{trying out}} with the New York Giants at the Polo Grounds, Koufax did {{the same for the}} Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field. During his Pirates tryout, Koufax's fastball broke the thumb of Sam Narron, the team's bullpen coach. Branch Rickey, then the general manager of the Pirates, told his scout Clyde Sukeforth that Koufax had the [...] "greatest arm [...] ever seen". The Pirates, however, failed to offer Koufax a {{contract}} until after he was already committed to the Dodgers. Dodgers scout Al Campanis heard about Koufax from a local sporting goods store owner. After seeing Koufax pitch for Lafayette, Campanis invited him to an Ebbets Field tryout. With Dodgers manager Walter Alston and scouting director Fresco Thompson watching, Campanis assumed the hitter's stance while Koufax started throwing. Campanis later said, [...] "There are two times in my life the hair on my arms has stood up: The first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and the second <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Sandy Koufax throw a fastball." [...] The Dodgers signed Koufax for a $6,000 ($ today) salary, with a $14,000 ($ today) signing bonus. Koufax planned to use the money as tuition to finish his university education, if his baseball career failed.|$|E

500|$|The {{musical score}} for Girl with a Pearl Earring {{was written by}} the French {{composer}} Alexandre Desplat. Webber decided to hire Desplat after hearing a score he had composed for a Jacques Audiard film. Webber explained, [...] "He {{had a sense of}} restraint and a sense of lyricism that I liked. I remember the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the cue where Griet opens the shutters. He was really describing what the light was doing, articulating that in a musical sphere."

500|$|Wagner had {{completed}} Rienzi in 1840. With the strong support of Giacomo Meyerbeer, it was accepted for {{performance by the}} Dresden Court Theatre (Hofoper) in the Kingdom of Saxony and in 1842, Wagner moved to Dresden. His relief at returning to Germany was recorded in his [...] "Autobiographic Sketch" [...] of 1842, where he wrote that, en route from Paris, [...] "For the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the Rhine—with hot tears in my eyes, I, poor artist, swore eternal fidelity to my German fatherland."

[...] In her book, Lady in the Navy, Joy Bright Hancock quotes his reply: [...] "I advised Mrs. Rogers that at the present <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> no great need for such a bill..." [...] Nevertheless, within days Nimitz was in touch with all Navy Department bureaus asking them to assess their needs for an equivalent to the WAAC. With few exceptions, the responses were negative.

500|$|Writing about The Year of the Sex Olympics in 2003, Nancy Banks-Smith {{felt that}} Kneale {{was one of}} the few {{television}} writers whose work was particularly memorable.

[...] One of these fans was John Frusciante, {{who would later}} join the band as guitarist after Slovak's death. [...] Frusciante recalled: [...] "The first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the Red Hot Chili Peppers live was at the Variety Arts Center, {{and that was really}} amazing ... They were going for this real hard sound. [...] Hillel was doing all this awesome feedback and stuff. [...] It was the most magical experience I ever had in the experience of a show."

500|$|The {{scene in}} which Grimes regains {{consciousness}} and investigates his situation {{is reminiscent of the}} British horror films The Day of the Triffids (1962) and 28 Days Later (2002). Kirkman insisted that the similarities especially with 28 Days Later was coincidental. [...] "I saw 28 Days Later shortly before the first issue of Walking Dead was released," [...] he stated. [...] "That first issue came out in October of 2003 and 28 Days Later was released in the States in June of 2003. So we were working on our second issue by the <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it.

500|$|In the 1920s and 1930s, Rodgers and Hammerstein both became {{well known}} for {{creating}} Broadway hits with other partners. [...] Rodgers, with Lorenz Hart, had produced a string of over two dozen musicals, including such popular successes as Babes in Arms (1937), The Boys from Syracuse (1938) and Pal Joey (1940). [...] Some of Rodgers' work with Hart broke new ground in musical theatre: [...] On Your Toes was the first use of ballet to sustain the plot (in the [...] "Slaughter on Tenth Avenue" [...] scene), while Pal Joey flouted Broadway tradition by presenting a knave as its hero. [...] Hammerstein had written or co-written the words for such hits as Rose-Marie (1924), The Desert Song (1926), The New Moon (1927) and Show Boat (1927). [...] Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote material for musicals and films, sharing an Academy Award for his song with Jerome Kern, [...] "The Last <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Saw</b> Paris", which {{was included in the}} 1941 film Lady Be Good.|$|E

500|$|At one point, {{the project}} was nearly {{abandoned}} because Peirce was not satisfied {{with most of the}} people who auditioned. In 1996, after a hundred female actors had been considered and rejected, the relatively unknown actor Hilary Swank sent a videotape to Peirce and was signed on to the project. Swank successfully passed as a boy to the doorman at her audition. During her audition, Swank, who was 22, lied to Peirce about her age. Swank said that like Brandon she was 21 years of age. When Peirce later confronted her about her lie, Swank responded, [...] "But that's what Brandon would do". Swank's anonymity as an actor persuaded Peirce to cast her; Peirce said she did not want a [...] "known actor" [...] to portray Teena. In addition, Peirce felt that Swank's audition was [...] "the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> someone who not only blurred the gender lines, but who was this beautiful, androgynous person with this cowboy hat and a sock in her pants, who smiled and loved being Brandon." ...|$|E
500|$|Anime News Network {{had four}} editors review {{the first episode}} of the anime: Carl Kimlinger saw {{potential}} in its take on a typical anime premise, praising Tatsuya as the lead protagonist and its handling of mysteries surrounding the plot; Theron Martin, although hopeful because of its male lead and plot concept, expressed criticism towards the indistinguishable animation and constant exposition for the viewers; and Rebecca Silverman {{felt that it was}} bland and nothing special. The fourth reviewer, Hope Chapman, expressed immediate dislike towards the series, criticizing it for lacking anything to engage the viewers and for being a lazy adaptation of a light novel, and concluding the review with [...] "I can't even remember the last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> something with not a single redeeming factor or thing to recommend about it at all." [...] Silverman reviewed the series future episodes. Plotwise, she praised the Enrollment Arcs underline on standardized testing, criticized the Nine Schools Competition Arc for its execution and weak exposition, and felt the characters were uninteresting. Silverman felt the series doesn't live up to its potential and cited the background music and stilted animations as possible reasons.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. James Hunt {{reviewed}} the episode for the website [...] "Den of Geek" [...] in January 2013. He was surprised by the episode as he [...] "went in expecting something that was typically season one awful, and got something that was actually a lot of fun". [...] He thought that the theme of symbiosis between man and machine was [...] "interesting", stating it was the best episode up until that point in season one and one of the best of the season overall. Zack Handlen watched the episode for The A.V. Club in May 2010. He too was surprised by what he found. Handlen said that [...] "last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> it, I thought Riker and Minuet's interactions were cheesy as hell. They didn't bother me so much now, because they don't go on very long, and there's something hilarious about a man trying to seduce a computer simulation designed to respond to his seductions". But he said, [...] "I had fun with this, which I wasn't expecting", and [...] "thought this was solid". He gave the episode a B grade.|$|E
