5|$|The {{construction}} of the East–West Telegraph line in the 1870s, along Eyre's route, resulted in a hazardous trail that could be followed for interstate travel. A national highway was called for, but the federal government {{did not see the}} route as important enough until 1941, when a war in the Pacific seemed imminent. The highway was constructed between July 1941 and June 1942, but was <b>trafficable</b> by January 1942. Though originally named Forrest Highway, after John Forrest, by the war cabinet, it was officially named and gazetted Eyre Highway, a name agreed upon by the states' nomenclature committees.|$|E
25|$|Approximately 500 yards {{south of}} the defence {{installations}} on False Cape there is remnant evidence of the camp site at Sunny Bay that accommodated the coastal artillery, searchlight, anti-aircraft, and naval signal units involved in port defence. The road from the camp to the defence installation is still <b>trafficable,</b> with a concrete culvert where it crosses over the intermittent freshwater stream at Sunny Bay. There is a concrete rainwater tank on the ridge midway between the former camp site and the Cape. The cleared area of the camp site is now overgrown with secondary growth, but several concrete slabs which formerly supported walls survive, {{and there may be}} others yet to be identified. Three timber stumps in the foreshore at Sunny Bay are remnants of the timber jetty which once extended into the bay.|$|E
500|$|While initial {{estimates}} {{placed the}} construction cost at £125,000 {{over a period}} of four months, it actually cost twice as much, and was not completed until June 1942, though the road was sufficiently <b>trafficable</b> and in use by January of that year. The finished road, while an improvement over the previous route, still was {{not much more than a}} track. The only sections with a bitumen surface were the Madura and Eucla Passes. The formed width was , with some sections lightly gravelled over a [...] width.|$|E
2500|$|Initial Japanese {{reconnaissance}} {{had indicated}} a <b>trafficable</b> road to Kokoda. [...] Bullard reports the error in this. While {{the road was}} improved for vehicle transport to Sonobo, about halfway from Gona to Wairopi, levies from Rabaul and pack-horses would have to carry supplies the remaining distance to Kokoda and further forward. [...] Meanwhile, allied airpower interfered with the Japanese line-of-communication, particularly at the Kumusi River, making it uncrossable by day. [...] Soldiers advanced from Kokoda carrying 16 days rations. [...] The advance, {{from the end of}} July until Ioribaiwa, in mid September was to last for over forty-five days. [...] Their load included ammunition for the artillery and machine guns as well as [...] of rice per man.|$|E
5000|$|Information {{in regards}} to selling and supply also, {{possession}} of a classified substance is classed differently in each state. Some have small <b>trafficable</b> quantities, <b>trafficable,</b> large <b>trafficable</b> and commercial <b>trafficable</b> quantities as legislative policies. [...] Intent to sell and supply comes under trafficking laws in some states in Australia depending upon the amount of prohibited substance.|$|E
50|$|Paraguay {{has a small}} tourism industry. Total tourism {{receipts}} declined {{annually from}} 2000 through 2002. In 2003 Paraguay’s hotel occupancy rate was 38 percent. It increased by 15 percent in 2004. Small gains in tourism have come from business rather than leisure travellers. For many years, Paraguay served as a central market for <b>trafficable,</b> duty-free goods. However, crackdowns by the governments of Brazil and Argentina have stemmed the flow of shoppers travelling to Paraguay looking for <b>trafficable</b> items.|$|E
50|$|The town {{is reached}} by year-round <b>trafficable</b> dust roads or asphalt roads. There are bus {{connections}} to Bafoussam and Yaoundé.There {{is also an}} airstrip.|$|E
50|$|A <b>trafficable</b> track {{runs along}} the dam crest (500 metres). Bathing and water sports in the {{reservoir}} are not permitted. However, there is a circular path of 3.5 kilometres for walkers, mountain-bikers and skiers.|$|E
50|$|The Mount Spec Tourist Road {{was opened}} by Cecil Jesson, MLA for Kennedy, on 18 July 1937, {{sponsored}} by the Townsville and District Development Association and some twelve months after {{the full length of}} the road had become <b>trafficable</b> by car.|$|E
50|$|The next <b>trafficable</b> road {{north of}} Bells Line of Road that crosses the Blue Mountains is the Bylong Valley Way, which forms {{a more direct}} route between the Central West region and the Hunter Region, {{including}} the port of Newcastle, NSW.|$|E
50|$|The {{industrial}} revolution began in towns in Britain that {{were close to}} flowing rivers that easily accessed surface coal deposits that provided cheap energy along with access to <b>trafficable</b> rivers to transport their goods. This made them an ideal locations for the first factories.|$|E
50|$|The wide front {{verandah}} and the detached billiard {{room with}} its <b>trafficable</b> roof are rare in 19th century Brisbane domestic building. The core of Teneriffe House remains one of Brisbane's few surviving 1860s houses, {{and one of the}} few known Brisbane works by Melbourne architect W H Ellerker.|$|E
50|$|The {{district}} was served by two separate 2-foot (610 mm) gauge tramway systems. Both {{at one time}} handled passengers and general goods, as well as sugar cane. Mossman district owes its present prosperity to these tramways which pioneered the first reasonable transport in the neighbourhood, for <b>trafficable</b> roads followed later.|$|E
50|$|In 1926, the Gillies Highway between Yungaburra and Gordonvale was opened, {{providing}} the first <b>trafficable</b> {{road from the}} coast to the Tablelands. Yungaburra became a gateway to the natural attractions of the area and a blossoming tourist trade to the nearby lakes created a second period of development. Tourism has remained a major industry in the area.|$|E
50|$|Steenodde {{has its own}} <b>trafficable</b> dock. The hamlet {{used to be a}} {{port for}} the ferry line Amrum-Halligen-Schlüttsiel, today there is a small port for minor freight vessels and for yachts below 12 m of length. The oldest house on Amrum, the former inn Zum lustigen Seehund ("The Merry Seal") is located in Steenodde, it was {{constructed}} in 1720.|$|E
5000|$|The {{course at}} Templestowe still exists {{today in the}} Domain Wetlands. The course was never <b>trafficable</b> due to the massive incline known as [...] "the wall", with an incline ratio of 1:2.5 {{is thought to be}} the steepest bitumen surface in Australia, and so was only used during race events.Burgundy Street in Heidelberg was used for early Hillclimbs.|$|E
50|$|For {{the first}} one hundred years after this ceased to be {{the route of the}} Great Western Road it {{remained}} <b>trafficable,</b> but the destruction of the bridge at Phil's Falls on the Fish River in 1930 meant it was no longer a through route, and parts became untrafficable. However, most of this route remains in existence as a series of local roads.|$|E
50|$|Evelyn Court, a three-storeyed {{rendered}} masonry {{structure with}} a <b>trafficable</b> flat roof, is located between Pine Lodge and Julius Lodge, fronting Julius Street {{to the northeast}} and overlooking the Brisbane River to the west. The building has Art Deco architectural styling references, {{quite different from the}} adjacent Old English styling of Pine Lodge which shares a very similar floor plan and similar details.|$|E
50|$|Anticipating a {{heavy traffic}} between Bowen (Port Denison) and the interior, he {{recommended}} that the existing track be surveyed and cleared, and the creek crossings made <b>trafficable.</b> The Select Committee concurred. Plews engaged extra staff to carry out works in the Kennedy district and in 1863 and 1864 the Queensland Legislative Assembly allocated funds for road development in the area.|$|E
50|$|Coley Park {{has limited}} road access, {{with only two}} <b>trafficable</b> streets (Shaw Road and St Saviours Road) {{connecting}} the suburb's roads to the adjacent Berkeley Avenue, although {{there are several other}} access routes available only to pedestrians and/or cyclists. It is connected to Reading town centre by Reading Buses route 11, which operates every 20 minutes during the day, but less frequently in the evening.|$|E
50|$|In 1926, the Gillies Highway between Yungaburra and Gordonvale was opened, {{providing}} the first <b>trafficable</b> {{road to the}} Tablelands. Yungaburra became a gateway to the natural attractions of the area and a blossoming tourist trade to the nearby lakes created a second period of development. The road also made the church more accessible and Mass was celebrated twice a month. There were never enough Catholics in and around Yungaburra to support an incumbent priest.|$|E

The shop {{is believed to have}} been constructed around 1925, probably in conjunction with the adjacent shop, also on lot 16 and was first occupied by a tailor.|$|E
50|$|Some years later, {{a higher}} dam was erected a few metres {{downstream}} {{in order to}} increase capacity, but the original dam wall remains beneath the water, and is sometimes visible during bad droughts. The vertical ladders in the cliff face were still barely <b>trafficable,</b> with missing rungs and rusted anchorages, until their destruction in the January 1994 bushfires. This water supply system was decommissioned when both islands were linked to Sydney mains water.|$|E
50|$|In wet weather, two {{underpass}}es are not <b>trafficable</b> as {{they have}} been built on floodways. These are the Ferntree Gully Road underpass and the Wellington Road underpass. After a medium amount of rain the underpasses flood and trail users must cross over the major roads to continue along the path. This can prove dangerous and during peak traffic times, trail users are known to have waited up to 20 minutes to safely cross the roads when the underpasses have flooded.|$|E

Yungaburra became a gateway to the natural attractions of the area and a blossoming tourist trade to the nearby lakes created a second period of development. It is thought that the shop was constructed around this time and was probably a pair with the adjacent shop, also on lot 16. A barber and hairdresser {{are thought to have}} first occupied this shop.|$|E

The court building has changed little since, although there are modern fittings in the police office and the constable's office on the verandah no longer exists. A two-car garage has been constructed between the police station and residence. The 1914 lockup {{to the rear of}} the reserve was demolished recently.|$|E

50|$|Another route {{runs along}} the <b>trafficable</b> forest track in the Windautal valley then {{continues}} {{to the foot of}} the Kröndlhorn mountain, up to the Steinberghaus and the Gamskogel Hut.The shortest, but hardest, route {{runs along the}} eastern flank from the Gamskogel Hut through the Ahornau Alm steeply uphill to the Lagfelden Alm. From here it crosses open terrain on an unmetalled, but signposted route up to the summit.There is also an ascent from the Steinberghaus that runs alongside the Steinberggraben through the Neuhögen Alms and the Oberkar Alm up to the Lodronjoch saddle. From there it continues over the Ramkarkopf to the Steinbergstein.|$|E

50|$|The {{protect their}} road the Romans built the {{settlement}} of Mansio Scarbia at the Scharnitz Pass, from which the name Scharnitz is derived. The importance {{of the way of}} the Seefeld Saddle and through the Scharnitz Pass is evinced by the discovery of a Roman milestone near Partenkirchen; in addition the two most famous Roman road maps, the Itinerarium Antonini and Tabula Peutingeriana name this road as a primary military and trading route. The route was heavily used and probably built as a <b>trafficable</b> road. Remains of this Roman road may be seen near Klais, a section of sunken road there is still visible today with ruts worn into the surface.|$|E
50|$|The road {{improved}} {{access to the}} Darling Downs, {{and was one of}} a number of works during that era aimed at creating a more <b>trafficable</b> route to the area. However, complaints about poor road conditions continued until the roads were sealed decades later. The remnants are buried below 100-200mm of soil, which has limited attempts to assess the condition or surviving length of the road. In the 1970s, the former Shire of Laidley proposed having the road surveyed and researched with a view to exposing a small section for public viewing; however, no action was taken. The site was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.|$|E
50|$|Initial Japanese {{reconnaissance}} {{had indicated}} a <b>trafficable</b> road to Kokoda. Bullard reports the error in this.

Their load included ammunition for the artillery and machine guns as well as 18 kg of rice per man.|$|E
50|$|The hill {{provides}} excellent {{views of}} Mount Kembla and Mount Keira and is popular for photograph taking. It {{is connected to}} the Illawarra escarpment by Nebo Ridge. From the end of the <b>trafficable</b> part of O'Briens Road a short trail climbs to the summit area where, near television re-transmission towers and a water tank, one has almost 360 degree views, excluding that which the summit blocks. from here the Illawarra Coastal Plain is obvious, with the hills of Mount Mangerton, Mount Saint Thomas and Cobblers Hill appearing amidst residential areas. To the southeast lies Saddleback Mountain, Noorinan Mountain and Barren Grounds Nature Reserve, Knights Hill, the southern escarpment and, most obviously, Mount Kembla and Kembla West.|$|E
5000|$|The long {{section is}} a long, steep, narrow and winding road. Due to {{physical}} constraints, {{it was open}} only to buses, taxis and permit-bearing vehicles only and speed limit is set to 30 km/h. being too dangerous for double-decker buses to be <b>trafficable</b> and only [...] "single-deckers" [...] {{are used in the}} bus services. It starts near Ma Wan New Village and joins Chung Yan Road near a river before proceeding upwards to the valley between Sunset Peak and Lantau Peak. It reaches its highest point at a pass in Pak Kung Au (also known as Tung Chung Au) then follows a steep downhill route. The southern end joins South Lantau Road in Cheung Sha.|$|E
50|$|In late October 1867 {{gold was}} {{discovered}} in Gympie, Queensland. By this time, a road from Brisbane City to Kedron Brook had been completed with the Bowen Bridge opened in 1860, permitting the northern track along Gympie Road and Albany Creek Road {{to be used as}} an alternate route to the Old Northern Road. However, neither road was of good quality. On 8 May 1868 the Government announced that it had allocated 2700 pounds to construct a <b>trafficable,</b> more direct, road to the Gympie goldfields. The new road came through Kedron Brook, Downfall Creek, Little Cabbage Tree Creek before heading to Bald Hills and North Pine. This road is now known as Gympie Road and travels a route very different from the original aboriginal track.|$|E
5000|$|A snow road {{is a type}} {{of winter}} road, which is a road that is used or <b>trafficable</b> only in the winter. Snow roads make up {{some or all of the}} on-land {{segments}} of a winter road. The snow is either compacted in place or, when there is not enough of it, is hauled from elsewhere, then compacted. The snow may be processed, for instance, by agitation to reduce the size of the particles before compaction. Additional snow is also used to help protect the vegetation and as a means of improving trafficability. This snow, sometimes referred to as 'snow pavement', can be compacted to various level, depending on requirements and available equipment - a higher compaction will accommodate heavier vehicles and higher tire pressures.|$|E
