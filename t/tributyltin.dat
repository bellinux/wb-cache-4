5|$|Imposex has {{recently}} been detected in Laevistrombus canarium. Imposex {{is the development of}} male sex organs in female animals exposed to man-made organic tin compounds, such as <b>tributyltin</b> (TBT). It has negative consequences for several species of sea snails, ranging from sterility in some individuals to the extinction of entire populations. Tin compounds are biocidal anti-fouling agents mixed into paints to prevent marine encrustations on boats and ships. High concentrations of these compounds are commonly present in seawater near shipyards and docking areas, exposing nearby marine life to harmful effects. In a 2011 paper, Cob and colleagues found that imposex rates are high in dog conch populations near Malaysian ports; however, the researchers could not detect any cases of sterility in affected females. The authors concluded that females of L.canarium often develop a penis when seawater contains organotin compounds, but the phenomenon does not cause sterility in this species. The ability of the dog conch to survive despite imposex makes this species a suitable local bioindicator for organotin pollution.|$|E

30|$|Even {{though the}} usage of <b>Tributyltins</b> has been banned since 2008, they {{continue}} to persist in the environment, leading to severe contamination of the ecosystems {{as well as its}} accumulation in biological tissues (Horiguchi, 2012).|$|R
50|$|The {{prevalence}} of the protist and the disease {{are influenced by}} environmental factors such as temperature, salinity, and food availability to the host. Oysters exposed to environmental pollutants such as N-Nitrosodimethylamine and <b>tributyltins</b> experience more severe disease. At higher temperatures, the chemical defenses of the oyster, particularly its lysozymes, are reduced; infections are more common and more severe in the summer. Warmer winter ocean temperatures also promote outbreaks.|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} first examined various environmental {{chemicals and}} natural products (including pesticides, mitochondrial function-disrupting chemicals, benzophenanthridines alkaloids and <b>tributyltins)</b> for {{their capacity to}} bind to mouse brain cannabinoid- 1 (CB 1) receptors and modify the functional coupling of the CB 1 receptor to its G protein. Many of these compounds inhibited binding of [3 H]CP- 55, 940 and CB 1 receptor agonist-stimulated [35 S]GTPγS binding to the G protein at micromolar concentrations. While benzophenanthridines exhibited inverse agonist-like profiles, {{the majority of the}} other compounds acted as antagonists. Some environmental chemicals may have potential to interfere with endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic signaling in vivo and behavioral/physiological outcomes. This research also explored the effects of CB 1 receptor agonists and an antagonist/inverse agonist (AM 251) on exocytosis (as measured with acridine orange) in a purified synaptosomal fraction from mouse brain. Cannabinoid agonists inhibited KCl-induced exocytosis. Paradoxically, AM 251 was also inhibitory and failed to relieve CB 1 receptor agonist-dependent inhibition of exocytosis...|$|R

25|$|A study {{released}} in April 2013 {{has shown that}} air pollution can also stunt the growth of coral reefs; researchers from Australia, Panama and the UK used coral records (between 1880 and 2000) from the western Caribbean to show the threat of factors such as coal-burning coal and volcanic eruptions. Pollutants, such as <b>Tributyltin,</b> a biocide released into water from in anti-fouling paint can be toxic to corals.|$|E
25|$|One isothiazolinone, Sea-Nine 211 (4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolino-3-one, DCOI), has quickly {{replaced}} <b>tributyltin</b> as the {{antifouling agent}} {{of choice in}} ship hull paint. A recent study reported the presence of DCOI in both port water and sediment samples in Osaka, Japan, especially in weakly circulating mooring areas. Of environmental concern, DCOI levels predicted in marinas now are considered a threat to various marine invertebrate species. Isothiazolinones also are extremely toxic to fish.|$|E
40|$|Organotins, {{especially}} <b>tributyltins</b> (TBT) {{are highly}} toxic to many marine organisms. These compounds are introduced {{in marine waters}} by ship trafficking, ship scrapping activities, as antifouling compounds and sewage disposal. Marine fishes, crustaceans and molluscans are easily prone to organotins contamination. In View of this, a baseline monitoring {{study was conducted in}} order to establish the levels of organotins in edible marine fishes (n = 35), bivalves (n = 9), shrimps (n = 3), squids (n = 2) and crabs (n = 3) collected from Mumbai, Goa and Karwar on the west coast of India. At these locations average organotin concentration found in fishes, clams, shrimps, squids and crabs was 108 ng Sn g- 1 dw, 852 ng Sn g- 1 dw, 179 ng Sn g- 1 dw, 70 ng Sn g- 1 dw and 89 ng Sn g- 1 dw respectively. In all the samples butyltins dominated over phenyltins. The levels of organotins suggest that all the organisms were contaminated with organotins and their consumption may pose health problems to humans especially the clams...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: As {{the result}} of the {{ecological}} impacts from the use of <b>tributyltins</b> (TBT) in shipping, environmental legislation for the registration of chemicals for use in the environment has grown to a monumental challenge requiring product dossiers to include information on the environmental fate and behavior of any chemicals. Specifically, persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity, collectively known as PBT, are properties of concern in the assessment of chemicals. However, existing measurements of PBT properties are a cumbersome and expensive process, and thus not applied {{in the early stages of}} the product discovery and development. Inexpensive methods for preliminary PBT screening would minimize risks arising with the subsequent registration of products. In this article, we evaluated the PBT properties of compounds reported to possess anti-fouling properties using QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) prediction programs such as BIOWIN ™ (a biodegradation probability program), KOWWIN ™ (log octanol-water partition coefficient calculation program) and ECOSAR™ (Ecological Structure Activity Relationship Programme).

25|$|The {{prevalence}} of TBT and other tin-based anti-fouling coatings on marine vessels {{was a major}} environmental problem. TBT {{has been shown to}} harm many marine organisms, specifically oysters and mollusks. Extremely low concentrations of <b>tributyltin</b> moiety (TBT) causes defective shell growth in the oyster Crassostrea gigas (at a concentration of 20ng/l) and development of male characteristics in female genitalia in the dog whelk Nucella lapillus (where gonocharacteristic change is initiated at 1ng/l).|$|E
25|$|Tissue residue {{guidelines}} were developed for <b>tributyltin</b> (TBT) for the Harbor Island Superfund site, Lower Duwamish Superfund {{site and the}} Portland Harbor Superfund site. At the Harbor Island Superfund site, tissue trigger levels were developed to provide guidance on remediation action. Tissue residue toxicity reference value (TRV) was developed for TBT regarding mortality and growth at the Lower Duwamish Superfund site.

25|$|The 1960s {{brought a}} breakthrough, with self-polishing paints which used seawater's ability to hydrolize the paint's {{copolymer}} bond and release the stored toxin at a slow, controlled rate. These paints employed organotin chemistry ("tin-based") biotoxins such as <b>tributyltin</b> oxide (TBT) and were effective {{for up to}} 4 years. The discovery that these biotoxins have severe impact on mariculture, with biological effects to marine life at a concentration of 1 nanogram per liter, led to their worldwide ban by the International Maritime Organization in October 2001. TBT in particular {{has been described as}} the most toxic pollutant ever deliberately released in the ocean.|$|E
40|$|Compounds {{with direct}} immunotoxic properties, {{including}} metals, mycotoxins, agricultural pesticides and industrial chemicals, form potential human health risks due to exposure through food, drinking water, and the environment. Insights into {{the mechanisms of}} action are currently lacking {{for the majority of}} these direct immunotoxicants. Therefore, the present work aimed to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying direct immunotoxicity. To this end, we assessed in vitro the effects of 31 test compounds on the transcriptome of the human Jurkat T cell line. These compounds included direct immunotoxicants, immunosuppressive drugs with different mode of actions, and non-immunotoxic control chemicals. Pathway analysis of the microarray data allowed us to identify canonical pathways and Gene Ontology processes that were transcriptionally regulated in common by immunotoxicants (i) with structural similarities, such as the <b>tributyltins</b> TBTC and TBTO that activated the retinoic acid / X receptor (RAR / RXR) signaling pathway, and (ii) without structural similarities, such as As 2 O 3, DBTC, diazinon, MeHg, ochratoxin A, S 9 treated ochratoxin A, S 9 treated cyclophosphamide, and S 9 treated benzo[a]pyrene, that activated unfolded protein response, and FTY 720, lindane, and propanil, that activated the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. In addition, processes uniquely affected by individual immunotoxicants were identified, such as the induction of Notch receptor signaling and the down regulation of acute phase response genes by ochratoxin A. These findings were validated by quantitative Real-Time PCR (Q-RT-PCR) analysis of genes involved in these processes. Our study indicated that diverse modes of action are involved in direct immunotoxicity and that a set of pathways or genes, rather than one single gene can be used to screen compounds for direct immunotoxicity...|$|R
25|$|Biocides are {{chemical}} substances that deter the microorganisms responsible for biofouling. The {{chemical substances}} {{are incorporated into}} an anti-fouling surface coating, typically through physical adsorption or through chemical modification of the surface. Biofouling occurs on surfaces after formation of a biofilm. The biofilm creates a surface onto which successively larger microorganisms can attach. In marine environments this buildup usually concludes with barnacle attachment. The biocides often target the microorganisms that create the initial biofilm, typically bacteria. Once dead, {{they are unable to}} spread and can detach. Other biocides are toxic to larger organisms in biofouling, such as the fungi and algae. The most commonly used biocide, and anti-fouling agent, is the <b>tributyltin</b> moiety (TBT). It is toxic to both microorganisms and larger aquatic organisms. Biocides are also added to pool water, drinking water, and liquid lines for cooling electronics to control biological growth.|$|E

Reductive desulfonylation is typically accomplished with active metals or salts (sodium amalgam, aluminium amalgam, magnesium, samarium(II) iodide), tin hydrides (<b>tributyltin</b> hydride), or transition metal complexes with reducing agents or nucleophiles (PdCl2(dppp)/LiHBEt3, Pd(PPh3)4/LiHBEt3, Pd(PPh3)4/NaHC(CO2Et)2).

2500|$|On 22 November 2002, Onslow {{was taken}} by tugs to Garden Island for three weeks of {{maintenance}} in drydock. This included cleaning and repainting of the hull, replacement of the <b>tributyltin</b> coating used to prevent biofouling with a coating that was not harmful to marine organisms, and the sealing of several ballast tanks to improve the boat's stability and raise the aft section relative to the waterline. Onslow was returned to the museum on 11 December, and re-opened to the public three days later. In October and November 2008, Onslow returned to Garden Island for maintenance and upkeep. During this refit, an additional torpedo was loaded into the submarine's torpedo tubes and her hull was cleaned and painted. Another docking occurred on 18 May 2012, with hull cleaning, rust removal, repainting, and repairs to the boat's aft torpedo tubes done before she returned to display on 6 June.

2500|$|Marine Biofouling is {{described}} as the undesirable buildup of microorganisms, plants, and animals on artificial surfaces immersed in water. Significant buildup of biofouling on marine vessels can be problematic. Traditionally, biocides, a chemical substance or microorganism that can control the growth of harmful organisms by chemical or biological means, are used {{in order to prevent}} marine biofouling. Biocides can be either synthetic, such as <b>tributyltin</b> (TBT), [...] or natural, which are derived from bacteria or plants. TBT was historically the main biocide used for anti-fouling coatings, but more recently TBT compounds have been considered toxic chemicals which have negative effects on human and environment, and have been banned by the International Maritime Organization. The early design of anti-fouling coatings consisted of the active ingredients (e.g. TBT) dispersed in the coating in which they [...] "leached" [...] into the sea water, killing any microbes or other marine life that had attached to the ship. The release rate for the biocide however tended to be uncontrolled and often rapid, leaving the coating only effective for 18 to 24 months before all the biocide leached out of the coating.|$|E
