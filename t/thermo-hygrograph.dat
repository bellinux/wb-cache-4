50|$|A <b>thermo-hygrograph</b> or {{hygrothermograph}} is a {{chart recorder}} that measures and records both {{temperature and humidity}} (or dew point). Similar devices that record only one parameter are a thermograph for temperature and hygrograph for humidity.|$|E
50|$|He applied his {{technique}} in electrographs to observe atmospheric electricity, barographs and thermo-hygrographs {{to monitor the}} weather, and magnetographs to record the three components of geomagnetic force. The magnetographs were used by Edward Sabine in his global geomagnetic survey while the barograph and <b>thermo-hygrograph</b> were employed by the new Met Office to assist its first weather forecasts. Ronalds also supervised the manufacture of his instruments for other observatories around the world (the Radcliffe Observatory under Manuel John Johnson and the Colaba Observatory in India are two examples) and some continued in use {{until late in the}} 20th century.|$|E
30|$|Capillary {{blood samples}} were {{collected}} {{from the tip of}} the middle finger at rest and 3  min after the cessation of exercise to measure blood lactate concentration. The blood samples were analyzed using a portable lactate analyzer (Lactate Pro™/LT 1710, Arkray KDK Corporation, Japan). Total sweat rate (TSR) was calculated from differences in body weight between {{the beginning and end of}} the trial. Absorbed sweat rate (ASR) was calculated from the difference of total clothing masses between the beginning and end of the trial. Using TSR and ASR, evaporated sweat rate (ESR) was calculated as well. Clothing microclimate humidity was measured on the middle of the chest in the most inner layer between long-sleeved shirts and the skin using a portable <b>thermo-hygrograph</b> (Thermo Recorder TR- 72 U, Japan) every 5  s. Perceived wetted body regions were asked every 10  min, and perceived wetness area was calculated according to the method from Lee et al. (2008).|$|E
50|$|Some changes {{undergone}} by {{objects are}} reversible {{by adjusting the}} RH, but damage like cracks are more permanent. Keeping the RH within a reasonable span {{for the type of}} object and as consistent as possible will prevent most RH based damage. It is important to measure the RH of spaces regularly by using a number of tools including humidity strips, <b>thermo-hygrographs,</b> hygrometers, psychrometer and data loggers. Once the per cent humidity identified, {{there are a number of}} ways to adjust it by using humidifiers, dehumidifiers, improve heating and air conditioning systems and adjust the temperature of the space.|$|R
40|$|Those {{observations}} on the indoor-climate of the Jiko-in Temple (wooden old building) and Chuguji-hondo (ferro-concrete building recently built) {{were made by the}} aid of weekly type <b>thermo-hygrographs</b> and recording evaporimeters from January to December 1971. Main results obtained in this study are as follows: (1) The annual mean values of air temperature and humidity are, 15. 6 ℃ and 69 % (in Jiko-in Temple), 16. 7 ℃ and 65 % (in Chuguji-hondo) and 14. 8 ℃ and 73 % (out-door), respectively. (2) The value of diurnal range on air-temperature in Jiko-in Temple is about 2 ～ 4 times as large as the one of Chuguji-hondo. (3) On those days of high air-temperature in summer time, the sensible temperature in Jiko-in Temple building is low...|$|R
40|$|The first {{meteorological}} {{station in the}} Vernagtferner basin, called 'Gletschermitte' was run from 1968 to 1987. It was positioned on a small rock {{in the western part}} of the glacier at an elevation of 3078 m a. s. l. The coordinates were 46. 868939 ° N (Latitude) and 10. 802986 ° E (Longitude). The following parameters were recorded mainly during the summer months: Wind speed and wind direction, air temperature and humidity of the air and precipitation. The records of the first four parameters comprise hourly values from 1968 to 1986 / 1987, daily sums of precipitation run from 1977 to 1987. All quantities were recorded on paper chart, i. e. 'Woelfle-Windschreiber' for the wind components, mechanically driven <b>thermo-hygrographs</b> (1968 to 1975) and 'BTW-Langzeit-Thermo-Hygrograph' (1977 to 1987) for temperature and humidity, Belfort analogue weighing gauge for precipitation. In 1976, air temperature was recorded on a Schenk paper chart recorder. In addition, photographs of the eastern part of Vernagtferner were taken once a day in summer between 1981 and 1986...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} in a Pinus elliottii plantation, established in 1984, located in the Rio Negro Forest Research Station- Rio Negro – Paraná, owned by the Paraná Federal University, Paraná State, Brazil. The research objectives were to analyze the correlations between the FMA and FMA+ fire danger indices and the fine fuel moisture, and develop mathematical models to estimate the fuel moisture based on these indices. The meteorological variables were obtained from a SIMEPAR weather station, located 50 km away, and from a pluviograph and a <b>thermo-hygrograph</b> installed in the study area. The dead forest fuels were collected from 30 x 30 cm plots, between 12 noon and 2 : 00 PM, and classified as: AA – surface layer; AB – intermediate layer; AC – lower layer; and B -woody material with 0. 7 to 2. 5 cm diameter. The total fuel load varied from 3185. 50 to 4266. 01 g. m- 2. The fire danger indices were daily calculated and the values obtained in the fuel colleting days were used to calculate the correlations. The correlation coefficients between relative humidity and fuel classes were 0. 42; 0. 36; 0. 32; and 0. 41 for the AA, AB, AC, and B classes, respectively. The correlation coefficients between precipitation and fuel classes were 0. 57; 0. 38; 0. 34; and 0. 15 for the AA, AB, AC, and B classes, respectively. The correlation coefficients between the fuel classes and the FMA+ were - 0. 53; - 0. 56; - 0. 63; and 0. 81 for the classes B, AB, AA, and AC, respectively. The FMA+ was the most efficient variable in modeling development to estimate dead forest fuel moisture...|$|E
40|$|With the aim {{of obtaining}} {{meteorological}} data for establishment of the protection of ancient cultural properties, the observations on the indoor-climate of Syuzoko (ferro-concrete treasury recently built) and Hondo (old wooden building) {{as well as their}} outdoor-climate were made by the aid of weekly type <b>thermo-hygrographs</b> for the periods extending from July 1967 to September 1968. The data shows that Syuzoko has the annual mean value of 15. 7 °C in temperature and of 68 % in humidity, and is high in temperature by 2. 0 °C and low in humidity by 7 % relative to the outdoor, and moreover, is high by 1. 3 °C low by 3 % relative to Hondo, respectively. The maximum difference of monthly mean temperature between Syuzoko and the outdoor is found in summer time (3. 4 °C, Aug. 1967), and the minimumin winter (0. 3 °C, Jan. 1968), respectively. From the above it should be emphasized that some measures effectual to improve the atmospheric condition, especially that of high temperature in summer time in Syuzoko must promptly be taken in order to safely protect Juichimen-kannon which is made from dry lacquer...|$|R
40|$|The {{observations}} on the indoor-climate of the Sangatsudo (wooden building built about 1200 years ago) and Daibutsuden (the biggest wooden building in the world) of the Todaiji Temple and of the Shinyakushiji- hondo (wooden building {{as old as the}} Sangatsudo) as well as their outdoor-climate were made the aide of weekly type <b>thermo-hygrographs</b> for the periods extening from November 1968 to November 1969. Main results obtained in this study are as follows : Sangatsudo, Shinyakushiji-hondo and Daibutsuden showed annual mean values of 14. 7 °C in temperature and 72 % in humidi ty, 15. 4 °C and 71 %, and 14. 3 °C and 71 %, respectively. These annual mean values of about 15 °C and 70 % which appered in these buildings and also in many temple buildings in Nara City and its vicinity may be considered a standard condition for the preservation of Japanese antiquities. In those months of July, Augst and September, since some undesirable conditions of high temperature-humidity which are harmul for old materials are apt to appear in Sangatsudo and Shinyakushiji-hondo, we must pay attentions to protect antiquities from mold and noxious insects...|$|R
40|$|The Muroji Temple {{stands by}} a {{mountain}} stream and {{is surrounded by}} mountains on all sides, and embosomed in many big trees. In the Muroji-kondo (wooden old building) many old invaluable Buddhist statues are preserved. The observations on the indoor-climate of the Kondo {{as well as on}} its outdoor-climate, using weekly type <b>thermo-hygrographs</b> and a recording evaporimeter, were made for the period from January 1970 to March 1971. Main results obtained in this study are as follows: (1) In the Kondo and its outdoor showed annual mean values of 13. 0 °C in temperature and 74 % in humidity, 12. 3 °C and 81 %, respectively. These values of temperature are somewhat small as compared with those of other temple buildings in Nara City and their outdoors. (2) Maximum temperatures in the summer season are comparatively low, that is below 30 °C in most days, and minimum temperatures in the cold season fall to about - 10 °C in many days. (3) In those months of July, August and September, undesirable condition of high temperature-humidity appears in high frequency in the Kondo. (4) On evaporation, the difference of amount between this Kondo and some observed temple buildings is small, and their tendencies in annual variation resemble broadly...|$|R
