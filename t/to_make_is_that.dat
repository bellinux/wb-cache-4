500|$|However, Nurkse {{clarified}} {{that the}} finance for this development must arise to as large an extent {{as possible from}} the underdeveloped country itself i.e. domestically. He stated that financing through increased trade or foreign investments was a strategy used in the past - the 19th century - and its success was limited to the case of the United States of America. In reality, the so-called [...] "new countries" [...] of the United States of America (which separated from the British empire) were high income countries to begin with. They were already endowed with efficient producers, effective markets and a high purchasing power. The point Nurkse <b>was</b> trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> USA <b>was</b> rich in resource endowment as well as labour force. The labour force had merely migrated from Britain to USA, and thus their level of skills were advanced to begin with. This situation of outward led growth was therefore unique and not replicable by underdeveloped countries.|$|R

It is unthinkable that any young Englishman should find himself in Razumov's situation. This being so it would be a vain enterprise to imagine what he would think. The only safe surmise <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he would not think as Mr. Razumov thought at this crisis of his fate. He would not have an hereditary and personal knowledge or the means by which historical autocracy represses ideas, guards its power, and defends its existence. By an act of mental extravagance he might imagine himself arbitrarily thrown into prison, but it would never occur to him unless he were delirious (and perhaps not even then) that he could be beaten with whips as a practical measure either of investigation or of punishment.|$|E
6000|$|The first {{criticism}} I have <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the ACT seems {{unnecessary and}} fictitious. The {{occurrence of the}} content of a thought constitutes the occurrence of the thought. Empirically, I cannot discover anything corresponding to the supposed act; and theoretically I cannot see that it is indispensable. We say: [...] "I think so-and-so," [...] and this word [...] "I" [...] suggests that thinking is the act of a person. Meinong's [...] "act" [...] is the ghost of the subject, or what once was the full-blooded soul. It is supposed that thoughts cannot just come and go, but need a person to think them. Now, of course it is true that thoughts can be collected into bundles, so that one bundle is my thoughts, another is your thoughts, and a third is the thoughts of Mr. Jones. But I think the person is not an ingredient in the single thought: he is rather constituted by relations of the thoughts {{to each other and to}} the body. This is a large question, which need not, in its entirety, concern us at present. All that I am concerned with for the moment is that the grammatical forms [...] "I think," [...] "you think," [...] and [...] "Mr. Jones thinks," [...] are misleading if regarded as indicating an analysis of a single thought. It would be better to say [...] "it thinks in me," [...] like [...] "it rains here"; or better still, [...] "there is a thought in me." [...] This is simply on the ground that what Meinong calls the act in thinking is not empirically discoverable, or logically deducible from what we can observe.|$|E
6000|$|A point I wish {{still more}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if my {{relation}} of confidence with the actors in my drama who WERE, unlike Miss Stackpole, true agents, {{was an excellent}} one to have arrived at, there still remained my relation with the reader, which was another affair altogether and as to which I felt no one to be trusted but myself. That solicitude was to be accordingly expressed in the artful patience with which, as I have said, I piled brick upon brick. The bricks, for the whole counting-over--putting for bricks little touches and inventions and enhancements by the way--affect me in truth as well-nigh innumerable and as ever so scrupulously fitted together and packed-in. It is an effect of detail, of the minutest; though, if one were in this connexion to say all, one would express {{the hope that the}} general, the ampler air of the modest monument still survives. I do at least seem to catch the key to a part of this abundance of small anxious, ingenious illustration as I recollect putting my finger, in my young woman's interest, on the most obvious of her predicates. [...] "What will she 'do'? Why, the first thing she'll do will be to come to Europe; which in fact will form, and all inevitably, no small part of her principal adventure. Coming to Europe is even for the 'frail vessels,' in this wonderful age, a mild adventure; but what is truer than that on one side--the side of their independence of flood and field, of the moving accident, of battle and murder and sudden death--her adventures are to be mild? Without her sense of them, her sense FOR them, as one may say, they are next to nothing at all; but isn't the beauty and the difficulty just in showing their mystic conversion by that sense, conversion into the stuff of drama or, even more delightful word still, of 'story'?" [...] It was all as clear, my contention, as a silver bell. Two very good instances, I think, of this effect of conversion, two cases of the rare chemistry, are the pages in which Isabel, coming into the drawing-room at Gardencourt, coming in from a wet walk or whatever, that rainy afternoon, finds Madame Merle in possession of the place, Madame Merle seated, all absorbed but all serene, at the piano, and deeply recognises, in the striking of such an hour, in the presence there, among the gathering shades, of this personage, of whom a moment before she had never so much as heard, a turning-point in her life. It is dreadful to have too much, for any artistic demonstration, to dot one's i's and insist on one's intentions, and I am not eager to do it now; but the question here was that of producing the maximum of intensity with the minimum of strain.|$|E

The occasion {{marked the first time}} rock and roll and bluegrass were performed on the Carnegie Hall Stage. [...] "The time has come for Americans not to be ashamed of what we go for, musically, from primitive ballads to rock 'n' roll songs", Lomax told the audience. According to Izzy Young, the audience booed when he told them to lay down their prejudices and listen to rock 'n' roll. In Young's opinion, [...] "Lomax put on what is probably the turning point in American folk music [...] [...] [...] [...] At that concert, the point he <b>was</b> trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Negro and white music were mixing, and rock and roll <b>was</b> <b>that</b> thing." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am {{not without}} hope {{of being able}} to make it my best," [...] he said, as I went back to the subject, while we turned up our heels to the sky. [...] "At least the people who dislike my prose--and there are a great many of them, I believe--will dislike this work most" [...] This was the first time I had heard him allude to the people who couldn't read him,--a class which is {{supposed}} always to sit heavy upon the consciousness of the man of letters. A man organized for literature, as Mark Ambient was, must certainly have had the normal proportion of sensitiveness, of irritability; the artistic ego, capable in some cases of such monstrous development, must have been, in his composition, sufficiently erect and definite. I will not therefore {{go so far as to}} say that he never thought of his detractors, or that he had any illusions with regard to the number of his admirers (he could never so far have deceived himself as to believe he was popular); but I may at least affirm that adverse criticism, as I had occasion to perceive later, ruffled him visibly but little, that he had an air of thinking it quite natural he should be offensive to many minds, and that he very seldom talked about the newspapers, which, by the way, were always very stupid in regard to the author of Beltraffio. Of course he may have thought about them--the newspapers--night and day; the only point I wish <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he did n't show it; while, at the same time, he did n't strike one as a man who was on his guard. I may add that, as regards his hope of making the work on which he was then engaged the best of his books, it was only partly carried out. That place belongs, incontestably, to Beltraffio, in spite of the beauty of certain parts of its successor. I am pretty sure, however, that he had, at the moment of which I speak, no sense of failure; he was in love with his idea, which was indeed magnificent, and though for him, as, I suppose, for every artist, the act of execution had in it as much torment as joy, he saw his work growing a little every day and filling-out the largest plan he had yet conceived. [...] "I want to be truer than I have ever been," [...] he said, settling himself on his back, with his hands clasped behind his head; [...] "I want to give an impression of life itself. No, you may say what you will, I have always arranged things too much, always smoothed them down and rounded them off and tucked them in,--done everything to them that life does n't do. I have been a slave to the old superstitions." ...|$|E
6000|$|Meanwhile if I've been {{deprived}} of you on one plane I've been living with you very hard on another; {{you may not have}} forgotten that you kindly sent me [...] "Marriage" [...] (as you always so kindly render me that valued service;) which I've been able to give myself to at my less afflicted and ravaged hours. I have read you, as I always read you, and as I read no one else, with a complete abdication of all those [...] "principles of criticism," [...] canons of form, preconceptions of felicity, references to the idea of method or the sacred laws of composition, which I roam, which I totter, through the pages of others attended in some dim degree by the fond yet feeble theory of, but which I shake off, as I advance under your spell, with the most cynical inconsistency. For under your spell I do advance--save when I pull myself up stock still in order not to break it with so much as the breath of appreciation; I live with you and in you and (almost cannibal-like) on you, on you H. G. W., to the sacrifice of your Marjories and your Traffords, and whoever may be of their company; not your treatment of them, at all, but, much more, their befooling of you (pass me the merely scientific expression--I mean your fine high action in view of the red herring of lively interest they trail for you at their heels) becoming thus of the essence of the spectacle for me, and nothing in it all [...] "happening" [...] so much as these attestations of your character and behaviour, these reactions of yours as you more or less follow them, affect me as vividly happening. I see you [...] "behave," [...] all along, much more than I see them even when they behave (as I'm not sure they behave most in [...] "Marriage") with whatever charged intensity or accomplished effect; so that the ground of the drama is somehow most of all the adventure for you--not to say of you--the moral, temperamental, personal, expressional, of your setting it forth; an adventure in fine more appreciable to me than any of those you are by way of letting them in for. I don't say that those you let them in for don't interest me too, and don't [...] "come off" [...] and people the scene and lead on the attention, about as much as I can do with; but only, and always, that you beat them on their own ground and that your [...] "story," [...] through the five hundred pages, says more to me than theirs. You'll find this perhaps a queer rigmarole of a statement, but I ask you to allow for it just now as the mumble, at best, of an invalid; and wait a little till I can put more of my hand on my sense. Mind you that the restriction I may seem to you to lay on my view of your work still leaves that work more convulsed with life and more brimming with blood than any it is given me nowadays to meet. The point I have wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I find myself absolutely unable, and still more unwilling, to approach you, or to take leave of you, in any projected light of criticism, in any judging or concluding, any comparing, in fact in any aesthetic or [...] "literary" [...] relation at all; and this {{in spite of the fact}} that the light of criticism is almost that in which I most fondly bask and that the amusement I consequently renounce is one of the dearest of all to me. I simply decline--that's the way the thing works--to pass you again through my cerebral oven for critical consumption: I consume you crude and whole and to the last morsel, cannibalistically, quite, as I say; licking the platter clean of the last possibility of a savour and remaining thus yours abjectly, ...|$|E

40|$|We {{point out}} that in a large class of {{superstring}} [...] inspired E(6) models, either an e+e- collider operating at a center [...] of [...] mass energy = 1. 5 TeV or higher must detect the pair production of charged or neutral exotic leptons, or an e+e- collider with ≥ 300 GeV must discover at least one light neutral Higgs boson with invisible branching ratio exceeding 50 %. If neither of these two signals is seen, the lightest neutral exotic lepton would overclose the universe, and the model could be completely excluded, independent {{of the values of}} the numerous free parameters. Future Higgs searches might lower the energy of the e+e- collider needed to test these models decisively. The only assumptions we have <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> R-parity <b>is</b> exact, so <b>that</b> the lightest exotic lepton is stable if it is lighter than the lightest neutralino, and that no SO(10) singlet scalar gets a vacuum expectation of order 10 ^ 10 GeV or higher.
