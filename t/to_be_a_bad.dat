5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. The question {{is only one of}} limits: how far to go. When one crosses the line, then the compromise starts <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad,</b> even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, may be related to Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E
5|$|This {{variation}} {{is named after}} Alekhine thanks to his wins in the games Alekhine–Rabinovic (Baden Baden, 1925) and Alekhine–Seitz (Hastings, 1926). White does not try to keep its material advantage (the e5-pawn) and concentrates on establishing a strong pawn center and space advantage. A controversial point is whether the typical black manoeuvre Bf8–b4–xc3 is advantageous for Black (as it saddles White with doubled pawns) or for White (as it reinforces his centre). Lalic thinks both, considering 6...Bb4+ <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> move after 4...Nxe5 5.f4 Nec6 6.Nf3, but a good one after 4...Nxe5 5.f4Nec6 6.Be3. After 4.e4 the main line is 4...Nxe55.f4 when Black has an important choice to make about where to move the Ne5. The retreat to the queenside with 5...Nec6 is considered best, while the retreat to the kingside with 5...Ng6 is probably playable.|$|E
5|$|After {{his arrival}} in Walford, AJ's brother Masood (Nitin Ganatra) makes sure he avoids his ex-wife Zainab (Nina Wadia), because she dislikes him. AJ proves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> {{influence}} on Masood when they damage Derek Branning's (Jamie Foreman) car with a shopping trolley and AJ is punched by Derek. AJ discovers that Masood and Zainab are divorced and later tells Masood he came to Walford because his wife Aliyah (Ann Wenn) has left him. After Masood inspires AJ with his reunion with Zainab, AJ leaves to reconcile with his own wife. He returns {{a few weeks later}} saying that he and Aliyah are divorcing. Zainab contacts Aliyah to try to get her to take AJ back, and AJ says that Aliyah had an affair. Aliyah drops off AJ's belongings and reveals that there was no affair. AJ then explains that he left Aliyah because she wants children and he does not. AJ moves in with Masood and his family. Zainab dislikes his laziness and she becomes annoyed when he brings Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) back after a drunken evening. Roxy stays the night but makes it clear that it was a one-off.|$|E

25|$|To {{prepare for}} the second {{qualification}} match, Scotland travelled to Perpignan to play test nation France. Scotland rested several key players, like Danny Brough and Ian Henderson, and gave caps to six début players.

40|$|International audienceA {{major issue}} for {{industrial}} systems is the joint management of ageing and maintenance. An efficient maintenance and a controlled ageing allow {{the extension of}} the operating life on equipment. A system subject to corrective maintenance (CM) and preventive maintenance (PM) actions is considered. CM is carried out after failure. It is done at unpredictable random times. Its aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> quickly restore the system in working order. Then, CM effects <b>are</b> assumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>As</b> <b>Bad</b> <b>As</b> Old (ABAO, i. e. leave the system in the state as it was before maintenance). PM are carried out when the system is operating and intend to slow down the wear process and reduce the frequency of occurrence of system failures.

25|$|Fidgeting is the act {{of moving}} about restlessly. Fidgeting may {{be a result of}} nervousness, agitation, boredom or a {{combination}} of these. It may be a result of genes and is often an unconscious act. Fidgeting may involve playing with one's fingers, hair, or items of clothing. A common act of fidgeting is to bounce one's leg repeatedly. Rings are another common focus of fidgeting; variations include ring spinning, twirling or rolling along a table.

Things didn't get better for Dallas after starting the season 0–3, losing to the Thunder in a playoff rematch on December 29. As the calendar turned to 2012, the Mavericks won 13 of 18 games in January, but they posted a 22–22 record the rest of the way, eventually finishing 7th with a 36–30 record, their lowest finish since the 2007–08 season. Nowitzki produced 21.6 points, 6 rebounds and 45.7% shooting, his lowest numbers since the 2000–01 season.

25|$|Hohenlohe's {{capitulation}} proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> precedent to {{a subsequent}} string of abject Prussian surrenders {{in the next}} few days. In the Capitulation of Pasewalk on 29 October, 4,000 Prussians surrendered to a force smaller than their own. Soon afterward, in the Capitulation of Stettin, Lasalle's light cavalry brigade bluffed the fortress commandant into surrendering his 5,000-man garrison. Since Auerstedt, Blücher had carefully preserved an artillery convoy. But on 30 October, Major von Höpfner surrendered with 600 soldiers and 25 guns to some of Lannes' units at Boldekow, 14 kilometers south of Anklam. On 1 November, the fortress of Küstrin capitulated to General of Brigade Nicolas Hyacinthe Gautier's brigade of Davout's corps. A French dragoon brigade caught up with the 1,100 infantry and 1,073 cavalry of Bila at Anklam. Bila had been joined by his older brother Karl Anton Ernst von Bila with a battalion from Hanover. On 31 October, General of Division Nicolas Léonard Beker forced them to withdraw to {{the north side of the}} Peene River and convinced them to capitulate the next day.|$|E
25|$|Less {{than a month}} later, on August 10, Glen Rice {{was traded}} to the Houston Rockets and guard Muggsy Bogues to the Dallas Mavericks as part of a three-team deal in {{exchange}} for guard Howard Eisley from the Mavericks and forward Shandon Anderson from the Rockets. On paper this trade looks merely like a swap of average NBA players, but this was not the case. Eisley would end up playing in 154 games for Knicks, providing adequate numbers at the point guard position, but he was currently in the second year of a 7-year, $41 Million contract that he signed by Layden's former organization, the Utah Jazz. At the same time, Anderson, another former member of the Jazz was {{in the first year of}} a 6-year, $42 Million contract that he signed with the Rockets, which extended through the 2006-07 season. Anderson played in 245 games for the knicks over four seasons before being waived due to poor performance; he averaged less than 3 rebounds and 8 points-per-game during his stay. In comparison to the contracts New York gave up, Bogues was in the second year of a 4-year $8 Million contract with the fourth year being a team option, and Rice was under contract for three more years and $27 Million. The trade proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> financial decision as the team was well over the salary cap limit.|$|E

50|$|Albeit {{the first}} live {{telecast}} from Velká Chuchle being on 3 June 1962, Velká Chuchle was losing its {{position as the}} site of premier flat racing in Central Europe. There may have been several reasons for this. First, leading professionals began to leave Velká Chuchle, new jockeys and trainers did not have any international experience, the racing facilities had not been cared properly for, and <b>were</b> beginning <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> state, and breeding and training methods were deteriorating in quality. Furthermore, other socialist countries, more populous than Czechoslovakia, such as the Soviet Union, had growing flat racing centers, pushing out Velká Chuchle.

25|$|By 1923, during Prohibition, Long Hill was {{attracting}} more {{guests for}} its supply of home-brewed ciders and beers than its sporting facilities.

In 1924, Welsh was back in court, after {{he was involved in}} a car collision caused by him driving his vehicle {{on the wrong side of}} the road. Welsh began looking for other ventures to take him away from the health farm, and in 1925 he rejoined the US Army, becoming a boxing instructor at the Plattsburg Barracks in upstate New York. While in the forces he placed an advertisement for a manager to run Long Hill, which was accepted by neighbour and friend, Sidky Bey, and his wife Hranoush, known as Madame Bey. With strict curfew hours and a no-alcohol policy, Madame Bey made the farm a success, and Long Hill became an important training venue for New York boxers. But her tenure at the farm ended acrimoniously, over an argument with boxer Battling Siki, who Welsh believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>bad</b> influence. After discussing the matter with other boxers, Madame Bey left Long Hill and set up her own rival venue. With Welsh in the Army and Madame Bey gone, the farm fell into disrepair. Bey later recalled Welsh fondly, stating that he was a man who enjoyed having a good time, but was a terrible businessman.|$|E
