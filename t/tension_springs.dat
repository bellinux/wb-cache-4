50|$|A {{key feature}} of the Anglepoise design and patent is the {{placement}} of all springs (either three or four) near the base. The design was extensively copied by other companies, usually in simplified form, and is still in use. Some derivatives use a heavy balance weight instead of the springs.

50|$|In 1943 James {{was trying}} to develop a means for {{suspending}} sensitive shipboard instruments aboard naval vessels, even in rough seas, and was working with <b>tension</b> <b>springs</b> when he accidentally dropped one. Seeing how the spring kept moving after it hit the ground, and an idea for a toy was born. A coil winding machine and started the James Spring & Wire Company to mass-produce the Slinky. The following year, Betty came up with the name Slinky after leafing through the dictionary and thinking that the word described the motion of the spring. The couple made 400 of the toys and convinced the Gimbels department store in Philadelphia to carry the toy for Christmas 1945 displayed on a ramp. These first models were all sold within 90 minutes at a price of $1 each. The toy became a huge success, with around 300 million Slinkys purchased since then. A quarter of a billion Slinkys are still sold every year around the world today.|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} an independent thesis corresponding 15 hp and {{was carried out}} on Högskolan in Halmstad {{during the spring of}} 2014. The thesis is the final course which ends a three-year mechanical engineering program with focus on technical design. The thesis started in an operation which electricians are exposed to every day. The operation in question is cable laying or wiring. The tool they use is called a <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> and is a long and stiff wire, usually made out of nylon or fiberglass. The <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> is fed through pipes in the walls and brings the desired cables with it on the way back. The problem shows up when the <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> is drawn back by the electrician. The stiffness in the <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> causes it to tangle itself and that causes unnecessary irritation and a waste of time. The problem gave an electrician and a good friend an idea about a product that could solve the problem in an easy and functional way. The idea started as a simple idea {{and with the help of}} several different product development methods from a production-, construction-, and design point of view a special methodology was developed, perfectly customized for the thesis. Potential customer gave the verdicts and helped create the needs and requirements for the product. The product went through a big process with creating different concepts and a lot of time was spent in CATIA for the final creation. One of the great goals of the thesis was to create a functional prototype, something that has been achieved and is now ready to be tested in a real environment. ...|$|R

It was founded to haul coal from the company's mines to Provo, Utah, in reaction to company disappointment in the service and route of the existing Denver and Rio Grande Railroad nearby. It was known for owning the most modern equipment; when built, its large [...] "Santa Fe" [...] (2-10-2) and [...] "Mallet" [...] (2-6-6-2) steam locomotives had automatic stokers, a new invention at the time, and a convenience that drew many firemen from the D&RGW's Utah Division to the Utah Railway in 1917 when that line opened. In addition, the Utah Railway was the first to equip its air brakes with fourteen-pound <b>tension</b> <b>springs</b> instead of the standard seven-pound springs. The company was one of the earliest coal hauling railroads to employ diesel locomotives, and was early to adopt automation technologies, including the use of flashing rear end devices instead of cabooses. The Utah Railway's freight car roster consisted of fifteen flatcars and about 2,000 drop-bottom gondolas jointly owned with the San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt Lake (later LA&SL) Railroad, painted with [...] "Utah Coal Route" [...] lettering and UCR reporting marks. These gondolas were known to the railroad's employees as [...] "Battleships". Parent company Mueller Industries, a manufacturer of copper products, sold the Utah Railway in 2002 to Genesee & Wyoming Inc., a railroad holding company.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the {{development}} of a new social robotic head, the mechanical solution of the robot neck has a major importance due to the fact that this one must support all the head components and must provide soft and natural movements of the robotic head. Hence, to choose the most suitable design, a systematic exploration of the neck mechanical solutions developed until now was conducted. Based on it and, also, on the preliminary imposed criteria, the adopted solution of the neck used for the new design of the social robot was a serial mechanism with 3 degrees of freedom, actuated with high torque servomotors. Additionally, to reduce the motors torque and for gravity compensation, the neck was equipped with helical <b>tension</b> <b>springs.</b> In this paper, a mechanical solution of the neck adopted by the authors, and a mathematical model, will be presented...|$|E
40|$|A {{previous}} {{adhesive joint}} analysis that accommodated non-linear adhesive behaviour is extended {{to model the}} elasto-plastic response of the adherends. The resulting analysis models the joint as an adherend-adhesive sandwich capable of sustaining any combination of end load conditions, thus enabling {{a wide variety of}} adhesive joints to be modelled. The adhesive is assumed to behave as a coupled set of non-linear shear and <b>tension</b> <b>springs,</b> and the adherends as cylindrically bent plates which yield under the action of combined tension and bending. The complete problem is reduced to a set of six non-linear first-order ordinary differential equations which are solved numerically using a finite-difference method. In this way a reasonable assessment of adhesive stresses and strains can be obtained easily, without resorting to the complexity of a two-dimensional finite element solution. A comparison between the results from these two methods has been made and is presented in this paper after the outline of the analysis derivations. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Passive {{dynamics}} {{plays an}} important role in legged locomotion of the biological systems. The use of passive dynamics is expected for energy efficiency, self-stabilization against disturbances, and generating gait patterns and behavioral diversity in general. Inspired from the theoretical and experimental studies in biomechanics, this paper presents a novel bipedal locomotion model of walking and running biped robots which uses compliant legs. This model consists of three-segment legs, two servomoters, and four passive joints that are constrained by eight <b>tension</b> <b>springs.</b> The self-organization of two gait patterns (walking and running) is shown in simulation and in a real-world robot. The analysis of joint kinematics and ground reaction force explains how a minimalistic control architecture can exploit the particular leg design for generating different gait patterns. Moreover, it is shown how the proposed model can be controlled with the simplest control architecture, which would lead to our comprehensive understanding of the stability and control in adaptive biped locomotion of robots and human.

40|$|A {{clinostat}} for simulating microgravity on {{cell systems}} {{carried in a}} fiber fixedly mounted in a rotatable culture vessel is disclosed. The clinostat is rotated horizontally along its longitudinal axis to simulate microgravity or vertically as a control response. Cells are injected into the fiber and {{the ends of the}} fiber are sealed and secured to spaced end pieces of a fiber holder assembly which consists of the end pieces, a hollow fiber, a culture vessel, and a <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> with three alignment pins. The <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> is positioned around the culture vessel with its ends abutting the end pieces for alignment of the spring. After the fiber is secured, the spring is decompressed to maintain tension on the fiber while it is being rotated. This assures that the fiber remains aligned along the axis of rotation. The fiber assembly is placed in the culture vessel and culture medium is added. The culture vessel is then inserted into the rotatable portion of the clinostat and subjected to rotate at selected rpms. The internal diameter of the hollow fiber determines the distance the cells are from the axis of rotation...|$|R
30|$|An {{additional}} mechanical {{mechanism for}} a passive parallelogram-based exoskeleton arm-support is presented. It consists of several levers and joints and an attached extension coil spring. The additional mechanism has two favourable features. On {{the one hand}} it exhibits an almost iso-elastic behaviour whereby the lifting force of the mechanism is constant for a wide working range. Secondly, {{the value of the}} supporting force can be varied by a simple linear movement of a supporting joint. Furthermore a standard <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> can be used to gain the desired behavior. The additional mechanism is a 4 -link mechanism affixed to one end of the spring within the parallelogram arm-support. It has several geometrical parameters which influence the overall behaviour. A standard optimisation routine with constraints on the parameters is used to find an optimal set of geometrical parameters. Based on the optimized geometrical parameters a prototype was constructed and tested. It is a lightweight wearable system, with a weight of 1.9 kg. Detailed experiments reveal a difference between measured and calculated forces. These variations can be explained by a 60  % higher pre load force of the <b>tension</b> <b>spring</b> and a geometrical offset in the construction.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a novel {{design of a}} compact and lightweight robotic hand for a social humanoid robot. The proposed system is able to perform common hand gestures and self-adaptable grasps by mixing under-actuated and self-adaptable hand kinematics in a unique design. The hand answers the need for precise finger postures and sensor-less force feedback during gestures and for finger adaptation and autonomous force distribution during grasps. These are provided by a dual actuation system embodied within the palm and the fingers. Coexistence is ensured by compliant transmissions based on elastomer bars rather than classical <b>tension</b> <b>springs,</b> thanks to their high elastic coefficient at reduced sizes and strains. The proposed solution significantly reduces the weight {{and the size of}} the hand by using a reduced number of small actuators for gesturing and a single motor for grasping. The hand prototype (ALPHA) is realized to confirm the design feasibility and functional capabilities. It is controlled to provide safe human-robot interaction and preserve mechanical integrity in order to be embodied on a humanoid robot...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of placing interleaves between fiber reinforced plies in multilayered composite laminates is investigated. The {{geometry of the}} composite is idealized as two dimensional, isotropic, linearly elastic media made of a damaged layer bonded between two half planes and separated by thin interleaves of low extensional and shear moduli. The damage in the layer is taken {{in the form of}} a symmetric crack perpendicular to the interface and may extend up to the interface. The case of an H-shaped crack {{in the form of a}} broken layer with delamination along the interface is also analyzed. The interleaves are modeled as distributed shear and <b>tension</b> <b>springs.</b> Fourier integral transform techniques are used to develop solutions in terms of singular integral equations. An asymptotic analysis of the integral equations based on Muskhelishvili's techniques reveals logarithmically singular axial stresses in the half plane at the crack tips for the broken layer. For the H shaped crack, similar singularities are found to exist in the axial stresses at the interface crack tips in the layer and the half plane. The solution of the equations is found numerically for the stresses and displacements by using the Hadamard's concept of direct differentiation of Cauchy integrals as well as Gaussian integration techniques...|$|E
