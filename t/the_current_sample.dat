50|$|The Metropolis-Hastings {{algorithm}} {{works by}} generating {{a sequence of}} sample values {{in such a way}} that, as more and more sample values are produced, the distribution of values more closely approximates the desired distribution, P(x). These sample values are produced iteratively, with the distribution of the next sample being dependent only on <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>sample</b> value (thus making the sequence of samples into a Markov chain). Specifically, at each iteration, the algorithm picks a candidate for the next sample value based on <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>sample</b> value. Then, with some probability, the candidate is either accepted (in which case the candidate value is used in the next iteration) or rejected (in which case the candidate value is discarded, and current value is reused in the next iteration)−the probability of acceptance is determined by comparing the values of the function f(x) of the current and candidate sample values with respect to the desired distribution P(x).|$|E

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} state {{estimation}} {{problem for a}} class of recurrent neural networks with sampled-data information and time-varying delays. The main purpose is to estimate the neuron states through output sampled measurement; a novel event-triggered scheme is proposed, {{which can lead to}} a significant reduction of the information communication burden in the network; the feature of this scheme is that whether or not the sampled data should be transmitted is determined by <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>sampled</b> data and <b>the</b> error between <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>sampled</b> data and <b>the</b> latest transmitted data. By using a delayed-input approach, the error dynamic system is equivalent to a dynamic system with two different time-varying delays. Based on the Lyapunov-krasovskii functional approach, a state estimator of the considered neural networks can be achieved by solving some linear matrix inequalities, which can be easily facilitated by using the standard numerical software. Finally, a numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered scheme...|$|R

This is used in the context of World War 2 defined by people like Norbert Wiener, in (stochastic) control theory, radar, signal detection, tracking, etc. The most common use is the Kalman Smoother used with Kalman Filter, which is actually developed by Rauch.

In smoothing (also sense 2) all observation samples (from future) are used. Filtering is causal but smoothing is batch processing of the same problem, namely, estimation of a time-series process based on serial incremental observations.|$|E

50|$|Lossless JPEG is {{actually}} a mode of operation of JPEG. This mode exists because the discrete cosine transform (DCT) based form cannot guarantee that encoder input would exactly match decoder output. Unlike the lossy mode {{which is based on}} the DCT, the lossless coding process employs a simple predictive coding model called differential pulse code modulation (DPCM). This is a model in which predictions of the sample values are estimated from the neighboring samples that are already coded in the image. Most predictors take the average of the samples immediately above and {{to the left of the}} target sample. DPCM encodes the differences between the predicted samples instead of encoding each sample independently. The differences from one sample to the next are usually close to zero. A typical DPCM encoder is displayed in Fig.1. The block in the figure acts as a storage of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>sample</b> which will later be a previous sample.|$|E
