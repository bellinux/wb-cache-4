5|$|The {{figure of}} Miriam Yeung, {{unveiled}} on November 2006, {{is the first}} in the world designed <b>to</b> <b>giggle</b> via in-built sensors. Miriam is well known for her fun-loving and bubbly personality, and Madame Tussauds want to capture that essence in her figure.|$|E
500|$|The {{marriage}} ceremony {{was set for}} 2 May 1816. [...] On the wedding day, huge crowds filled London; the wedding participants had great difficulties in travelling. [...] At nine o'clock in the evening in the Crimson Drawing Room at Carlton House, with Leopold dressing {{for the first time}} as a British General (the Prince Regent wore the uniform of a Field Marshal), the couple were married. [...] Charlotte's wedding dress cost over â‚¤10,000. [...] The only mishap was during the ceremony, when Charlotte was heard <b>to</b> <b>giggle</b> when the impoverished Leopold promised to endow her with all his worldly goods.|$|E
2500|$|In {{other parts}} of the world, {{specifically}} Italy, the identical corna gesture is often used to imply cuckoldry. The gesture is also sometimes associated with the occult and satanism. The images of Jenna Bush publicly [...] "throwing the horns" [...] made headlines on tabloid news in Norway and caused the First Lady's press secretary, Gordon Johndroe, <b>to</b> <b>giggle</b> when he discovered the gesture, signed on one hand ("the head") in conjunction with flapping of the fingers on other hand (the [...] "business end"), means bullshit in sign language.|$|E
5000|$|Giggle incontinence, giggle {{enuresis}} or enuresis risoria is the involuntary {{release of}} urine in response <b>to</b> <b>giggling</b> or laughter. The bladder may empty completely or only partially.|$|R
5000|$|..... When {{they got}} up to the room they kissed {{each other in a}} hurry and washed up to go out to a show. First they went to Shanleys to dinner. Tony ordered {{expensive}} champagne and they both got <b>to</b> <b>giggling</b> on it.|$|R
25|$|Davis {{starred in}} three movies in 1941, the first being The Great Lie, {{opposite}} George Brent. It was a refreshingly different role for Davis, as {{she played a}} kind, sympathetic character. Brent tickled Davis during many of the film's scenes, which allowed the audience, used to Davis' strong-willed character, a rare glimpse of her succumbing <b>to</b> <b>giggles</b> and squirms.|$|R
2500|$|The whole {{apartment}} {{watches as}} the prostitute jumps up and down naked, and hits a giggling, equally naked Orr {{on the head with}} her heeled shoes. Each time she jumps and hit him, Orr giggles louder, making her even more angry. She then would jump even higher and hit him harder, causing him <b>to</b> <b>giggle</b> even more. The vicious cycle ends after fifteen to twenty minutes when she knocks him out cold with a good whack to his head, leaving him with a concussion [...] "that kept him out of combat for only twelve days." ...|$|E
60|$|Honora, {{in spite}} of her discomfort, had an insane desire <b>to</b> <b>giggle.</b> She did not dare to raise her eyes.|$|E
60|$|Wyatt {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>giggle</b> helplessly. He flung {{himself down}} on his bed, rolling with laughter. Mike began to get alarmed.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a sudden}} stir in the group. Mr. Craske had caught sight of Lady Ostermore and Mistress Winthrop, and he fell <b>to</b> <b>giggling,</b> a flimsy {{handkerchief}} to his painted lips. [...] "Oh, 'Sbud!" [...] he bleated. [...] "Let me die! The audaciousness of the creature! And behold me the port and glance of her! Cold as a vestal, let me perish!" ...|$|R
60|$|Lemuel {{sat in a}} quiver of abhorrence. The girl appealed <b>to</b> {{remained}} <b>giggling</b> {{beside her}} companion.|$|R
60|$|Lawrence was perplexed, {{and so was}} Quashy, for {{the quiet}} little Indian was not given <b>to</b> <b>giggling</b> at trifles, much less to {{laughing}} at nothing. Lawrence observed, however, that the girl did not reach out her hand with her usual graceful action, but on the contrary gave her arm an awkward twist which obliged the negro to stretch needlessly far over towards her in handing the meat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Beats the Crumville Hotel, doesn't it?" [...] said Dave, dryly, {{and this}} caused the girls <b>to</b> <b>giggle</b> {{and the other}} boys to laugh.|$|E
6000|$|With {{pity for}} his bewilderment, {{and a certain}} desire <b>to</b> <b>giggle,</b> she consoled him, [...] "Then let's try some Tennyson. You've read him?" ...|$|E
60|$|Columbine wanted <b>to</b> <b>giggle,</b> which impulse she smothered. The {{idea of any}} one asking Jim his name! She {{had never}} been able to find out.|$|E

60|$|Miss Overmore laughed again; it was {{the first}} time Maisie had seen her {{approach}} so nearly <b>to</b> a <b>giggle.</b>|$|R
50|$|On February 5, 2007, {{the music}} video was made {{available}} on Fall Out Boy's website and {{was directed by}} Happy Tree Friends creator Kenn Navarro. The video features Happy Tree Friends characters and cartoon versions of the band in a plot where Cuddles and Giggles have fallen in love, and Cuddles' attempts to express his love <b>to</b> <b>Giggles.</b> The video concludes {{with all of the}} characters, including the Fall Out Boy members, being killed in graphic and ultraviolent ways.|$|R
60|$|They entered: three fair young curates, {{nervous and}} {{inclined}} <b>to</b> <b>giggle.</b> Shades of difference of ecclesiastical opinion declared {{themselves in their}} hats, costume, and jewellery.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I think I'll {{eat some}} roast beef ten miles long," [...] said Dave. [...] "And two miles of apple pie to boot!" [...] And this caused the girls <b>to</b> <b>giggle.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then {{he touched}} the bell, and the little piece of private theatricals was played out, though one of the artists had some {{difficulty}} (as amateurs often have) in subduing an inclination <b>to</b> <b>giggle.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In theory, the Slobbovian Empire was a {{universal}} empire; the entire [...] "known world" [...] was by said theory {{subject to the}} Czar's authority. In practice, this concept evoked a range of attitudes ranging from some level of acceptance, to total disregard of or hostility to the Empire's suzerainty, <b>to</b> <b>giggling</b> disbelief. Some level of lip service being paid to the idea was the norm (particularly since acceptance of the concept was useful if one was aiming to become Czar).|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' {{said the}} Bishop, in an audible aside <b>to</b> the <b>giggling</b> Countess: 'this comes of her having thrown {{herself at the}} youth's head. Now he will no more of her.' ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Polly started <b>to</b> laugh--to <b>giggle</b> wildly--helplessly--and Emma and Muriel joined in. But Annie and Nora and Laura {{remained}} the same, tense, watchful, with gleaming eyes. He winced {{away from these}} eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{have been}} called, and {{now if you}} are not down in fifteen minutes you won't have any breakfast. Not a morsel, sir, not a morsel;' and, coolly {{pocketing}} his father's watch, he retired, <b>to</b> <b>giggle</b> all the way downstairs.|$|E
6000|$|Who {{was this}} insolent person? A man unquestionably--and, strange to say, there was {{something}} not entirely unfamiliar to me in his voice. The girls began <b>to</b> <b>giggle.</b> Their brother was more explicit. [...] "Oh," [...] says Freddy, [...] "it's only Mr. Sax." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Buck made {{a bitter}} face, and James Barker's {{nostrils}} curled; Wilson began <b>to</b> <b>giggle</b> faintly, and the Provost of West Kensington followed in a smothered way. But the big blue eyes of Adam Wayne never changed, {{and he called}} out in an odd, boyish voice down the hall-- ...|$|E
5000|$|Screaming at the Mirror Three: [...] "Get <b>to</b> Notice" [...] (<b>Giggle</b> Records, 1992) ...|$|R
5000|$|Sight & Sound {{described}} Kylie Minogue as Cammy [...] "hilarious miscasting as {{a military}} wench with Heidi plaits. There merest glimpse of her holding a bazooka and looking mean is enough <b>to</b> induce <b>giggles</b> in the most dour of viewers." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{sneak peek}} {{of the films}} Dr. <b>Giggles,</b> <b>To</b> Sleep with a Vampire, Beyond Darkness and Nemesis.|$|R
60|$|But {{there was}} more to follow. The Lady Mary {{accepted}} Mr. Caryll's salutation of Hortensia as a signal. She led the way promptly, and the little band swept forward, straight for its goal, raked by the volleys from a thousand eyes, under which the Lady Mary already began <b>to</b> <b>giggle</b> excitedly.|$|E
60|$|From {{the area}} below a slight cough sounded. Freddie turned sharply. A maid in a soiled cap, worn coquettishly over one ear, was gazing intently {{up through the}} railings. Their eyes met. Freddie turned a warm pink. It {{seemed to him that}} the maid had the air of one about <b>to</b> <b>giggle.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} {{refused to}} give him {{so much as a}} glance. He just grunted and kept right on about his business. All the little meadow people and forest folks began <b>to</b> <b>giggle</b> and then to laugh. Reddy knew that they were laughing at him and he grew very angry, for no one likes to be laughed at, least of all Reddy Fox.|$|E
6000|$|... (Zoe whispers <b>to</b> Florry. They <b>giggle.</b> Bloom {{releases}} {{his hand}} and writes idly {{on the table in}} backhand, pencilling slow curves.) ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{a concert}} with the Grieg Concerto in Britain afterwards, Previn had to pause the playing to allow the {{audience}} time <b>to</b> stop <b>giggling</b> as they remembered the sketch. Previn himself notes that people in Britain still recall the sketch years later: [...] "Taxi drivers still call me Mr Preview".|$|R
60|$|It was an {{occasion}} that thoroughly appealed to Athelny. He rehearsed all the afternoon how he should play the heavy father {{for the young}} man's edification till he reduced his children <b>to</b> helpless <b>giggling.</b> Just before he was due Athelny routed out an Egyptian tarboosh and insisted on putting it on.|$|R
