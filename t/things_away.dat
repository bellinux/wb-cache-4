It is estimated that up to 40 percent of people with narcolepsy experience automatic behavior during sleep episodes.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{took two}} {{important}} <b>things</b> <b>away</b> from {{his experience as}} an assistant coach for the Rams. First, under Barnett, Smith learned the principles of the ball-line defense, a hallmark of Smith's teams throughout his head coaching career. Second was a relationship with fellow assistant David Hobbs, an assistant and associate head coach under Smith during his tenure at the University of Kentucky.|$|E
500|$|..... And when Michel {{gets his}} strokes of genius and, {{in the video}} for [...] "Army of Me", wants a dentist that's a gorilla to find a diamond in my mouth, some people call it nonsense. But it's {{probably}} the most realistic way of expressing what situation I'm in - all these people trying to take <b>things</b> <b>away</b> from me, and the gorilla finding a diamond that I don't know I have and then stealing it. [...] "Army of Me" [...] is so much about me actually learning that I have to defend myself. I {{have to stand up}} and fight the fucking gorilla. Once I've got the diamond and I run away with it, it becomes massive 'cos it's mine. But if the gorilla had kept it, it would have gone really tiny. That's surrealism for me.|$|E
50|$|The idea is {{that there}} is a {{possible}} world with finitely many things. One can thus get another possible world by taking a single <b>thing</b> <b>away,</b> and one does not need to add any other thing as its replacement. Then one can take another <b>thing</b> <b>away,</b> and another, until one is left with a possible world that is empty.|$|R

2500|$|While {{the album}} was {{influenced}} by things such as macabre horror tales, zombies, and monsters, Donelly assured that {{the album was}} “always about something much more real", musing that [...] "there’s so much genuine evil in the world. That said, I love that people take {{all kinds of different}} <b>things</b> <b>away</b> from our songs, and invest so much of themselves in their interpretations.” To prevent the album from being to depressing, the band attempted to present the album with the aesthetic of a b-movie, with a comical, overly theatrical tone. Donelly also noted the desire to become more diverse musically with the second album, as the band had begun to listen to more sources of music.|$|E
2500|$|The song {{has been}} embraced by many liberal churches, {{and in the}} 1960s and 1970s it was sung both in Catholic church [...] "folk masses" [...] and as a hymn in Protestant ones. In 1997, Bob Dylan {{performed}} three other songs at a Catholic church congress. Pope John Paul II, who was in attendance, told the crowd of some 300,000 young Italian Catholics that the answer was indeed [...] "in the wind" [...] – not in the wind that blew <b>things</b> <b>away,</b> but rather [...] "in the wind of the spirit" [...] that would lead them to Christ. In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI (who had also been in attendance) wrote that he was uncomfortable with music stars such as Dylan performing in a church environment.|$|E
2500|$|Following the war, General Canby was {{retained}} {{by the army}} as one of only ten brigadier generals and served as military commander of various districts throughout the South. In an 1873 newspaper article, Mrs. Lew Wallace (née Susan Arnold Elston) would recall that Louisa practiced charity, tending to give <b>things</b> <b>away</b> to the needy wherever she went in the South, endearing herself to the local populace, but at some cost to her household. [...] "I can hardly keep anything, {{there is so much}} suffering about us," [...] Louisa wrote Wallace from New Orleans. She sometimes pleaded the case of someone in need to her husband if she thought he might help. Mrs. Wallace also said that Louisa was far more sociable than her husband and that she, rather than he, would arranged for any gatherings at the Canby residence.|$|E

2500|$|Senator Clinton {{voted against}} the two major tax cuts {{packages}} introduced by President Bush, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, saying it was fiscally irresponsible to reopen the budget deficit. At the 2000 Democratic National Convention, Clinton had called for maintaining a budget surplus to pay down the national debt for future generations. At a fundraiser in 2004, she told a crowd of financial donors that [...] "Many of you are well enough off that ... the tax cuts may have helped you" [...] but that [...] "We're saying that for America {{to get back on}} track, we're probably going to cut that short and not give it to you. We're going to take <b>things</b> <b>away</b> from you on behalf of the common good." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Tosefta {{employed}} verses {{from the}} book of Job to teach that the people of Sodom acted arrogantly before God because of the good that God had lavished on them. As [...] says, [...] "As for the land, out of it comes bread... Its stones are the place of sapphires, and it has dust of gold. That path, no bird of prey knows... The proud beasts have not trodden it." [...] The people of Sodom reasoned that since bread, silver, gold, precious stones, and pearls came forth from their land, they did not need immigrants to come to Sodom. They reasoned that immigrants came only to take <b>things</b> <b>away</b> from Sodom and thus resolved to forget the traditional ways of hospitality. God told the people of Sodom that because of the goodness that God had lavished upon them, they had deliberately forgotten how things were customarily done in the world, and thus God would make them be forgotten from the world. As [...] says, [...] "They open shafts in a valley from where men live. They are forgotten by travelers. They hang afar from men, they swing to and fro." [...] As [...] says, [...] "In the thought of one who is at ease, there is contempt for misfortune; it is ready for those whose feet slip. The tents of robbers are at peace, and those who provoke God are secure, who bring their god in their ...|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{read the}} words of [...] "he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt [...] [...] [...] but there was none that could {{interpret}} them for Pharaoh," [...] to teach that every {{nation in the world}} appoints five wise men as its ministers. And God grants each nation wisdom, understanding, and strength. When God judges the world, God takes these <b>things</b> <b>away</b> from the nation that God punishes, as [...] says, [...] "‘Shall I not in that day,' says the Lord, ‘destroy the wise men out of Edom, and discernment [...] out of the mount of Esau? And your mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed — broken.'" [...] The Midrash taught that the purpose of all this sending for and failing of magicians was so that Joseph might come at the end and be raised to high rank. God saw that if Joseph came at the beginning and interpreted the dream, Joseph would gain little praise, for the magicians would {{be able to say that}} had one asked them, we would have interpreted the dream long before. Therefore, God waited until the magicians had wearied and had exhausted Pharaoh's spirit, and then Joseph came and restored it. Thus [...] "A fool spends all his spirit," [...] refers to Pharaoh's magicians, and the continuation of [...] "But a wise man stills it within him," [...] alludes to Joseph, as [...] reports that Pharaoh said to Joseph, [...] "There is none so discreet and wise as you." ...|$|E
