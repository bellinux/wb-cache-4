5|$|The {{day before}} Jamila's execution, Ibrahim meets with Susi, who tells him about Jamila's romantic {{involvement}} with Nurdin. Jamila became pregnant with Nurdin's child {{and insisted that}} he take responsibility, but instead Nurdin <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> marrying someone else and humiliated her in public. When the two met in a hotel, Nurdin threatened Jamila with a pistol; in self-defence, Jamila killed him with the pistol. In the modern day, Jamila walks towards her execution; {{the president has not}} responded to the request for stay. The screen fades to black as a gunshot goes off, and afterwards, statistics about child trafficking and prostitution are shown.|$|E
25|$|The first {{contract}} writer {{she hired}} {{was not a}} writer but a movie producer whom she met {{at a dinner party}} hosted by the writer Marie Brenner. The producer <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to California for the trial of the strangler of his daughter. As solace, Brown suggested for him to keep a diary and his report (headlined Justice) proved the launch of the long magazine career of Dominick Dunne.|$|E

25|$|In 1947, Columbia Pictures offered Hellman a multi-year {{contract}}, {{which she}} refused because the contract included a loyalty clause that she {{viewed as an}} infringement on her rights of free speech and association. It required her to sign a statement {{that she had never}} {{been a member of the}} Communist Party and would not associate with radicals or subversives, which would have required her to end her life with Hammett. Shortly thereafter, William Wyler <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> unable to hire her to work on a film because she was blacklisted.|$|E
25|$|Israeli emigrants {{working in}} low status {{immigrant}} occupations that the diaspora Jewish population tends {{not to engage}} in or has long-ago abandoned such as taxi driving, auto repair, security guards, mall cart sales and other tasks. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir told of a waiter who once came over to her at a New York luncheon and whispered in Hebrew that there was ham in the dish she had been served. When she asked him how he knew Hebrew, he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> an Israeli. And what work had he done in Israel, she asked. He had been a waiter, he responded.|$|E

25|$|On June 5, 2013, Argentine chef Federico Tobares {{disappeared}} {{while driving}} from Puerto Vallarta to Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.

Tobares had moved from Argentina to Mexico in 2009 to pursue a career as a chef specialized in Mexican cuisine. He worked at Hotelito Desconocido and Nudoki, a hotel and restaurant in Jalisco. According to investigators, these two businesses were owned by Gerardo González Valencia, a suspected drug lord of Los Cuinis, a branch of the Jalisco-based criminal group Jalisco New Generation Cartel.|$|E
25|$|In {{a signed}} affidavit, Siddiqui's {{maternal}} uncle, Shams ul-Hassan Faruqi, stated that on 22 January 2008 she {{visited him in}} Islamabad and told him she had been held by Pakistani agencies. Knowing he had worked in Afghanistan and made contact with the Taliban in 1999, she asked for his help to cross into Taliban-controlled Afghanistan where {{she thought she would}} be safe. He <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> no longer in touch with them. He notified his sister, Siddiqui's mother, who came the next day to see her daughter. He said that Siddiqui stayed with them for two days. Investigating the disappearance, a US journalist (Deborah Scroggins) reported that Geo TV presenter Hamid Mir informed her that friends of Siddiqui believed she had gone underground avoiding the FBI. Scroggins was also warned by Pakistanis with jihadist connections (including Khalid Khawaja) that she (Scroggins) might end up like Daniel Pearl (beheaded) if she attempted to pursue finding Siddiqui.|$|E
500|$|Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) {{admits to}} Kenneth she once took a low-volume shower with actor Ed Begley, Jr., and said [...] "What more can I do?", after Kenneth <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{in charge of}} {{reducing}} TGSs carbon footprint, and that everyone has to help with this.

500|$|In 1987, {{after two}} and a half years of playing Daphne, Smith decided to leave Neighbours and asked to be written out. She felt that while Daphne had been [...] "a bit of a {{challenge}} at first", she felt trapped by her persona. Smith also believed that the role no longer offered her variety and she did not want to stay to be bored, but comfortable. As Daphne was one of Neighbours most popular characters, the producers chose not to kill her off. Instead Daphne's father, Allen (Neil Fitzpatrick), re-entered her life and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dying. Realising that she only had a short time to make her peace with him, Daphne took Jamie and moved away to nurse Allen. Viewers were not satisfied with this ending for the character, especially as it meant Daphne and Des would have to break up, a situation that they would not accept.|$|E
500|$|It {{was while}} Kent was {{away at a}} wedding {{in the country that}} the first reports of strange noises began. [...] Parsons had a wife and two daughters; the elder, Elizabeth, was {{described}} as a [...] "little artful girl about eleven years of age". [...] Kent asked Elizabeth to stay with Fanny, who was then several months into a pregnancy, and to share her bed while he was away. [...] The two reported hearing scratching and rapping noises. [...] These were attributed by Mrs Parsons to a neighbouring cobbler, although when the noises re-occurred on a Sunday, Fanny asked if the cobbler was working that day; Mrs Parsons <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not. [...] James Franzen, landlord of the nearby Wheat Sheaf public house, was another witness. [...] After visiting the house he reported seeing a ghostly white figure ascend the stairs. [...] Terrified, he returned home, where Parsons later visited him and claimed also to have seen a ghost.|$|E
500|$|Pam and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{are invited}} to Pam's former fiancé Roy Anderson's (David Denman) wedding, which takes place at 8am before work. They are both {{surprised}} by Roy's beautiful home and the elegant wedding details, and Roy tells them he runs a very successful gravel company. During his wedding toast, Roy stuns his lovely bride by performing [...] "She's Got a Way" [...] by Billy Joel on the piano, saying that he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> taking boxing lessons as a cover for learning some music for her instead. Pam and Jim, convinced they already know everything about one another but stunned by Roy's transformation, try to find things about themselves the other does not know. This is exacerbated by Jim's frequent calls about a new business he is starting with a friend, because Jim and Pam agreed that the venture was not right for them, but Jim then signed onto it without telling his wife he had done so. Pam tries unsuccessfully to bait Jim {{to find out what}} the secret is and becomes increasingly annoyed that her husband is lying to her.|$|E

500|$|The {{week that}} Hauck {{was sentenced to}} prison, Cox was living in Nashville, Tennessee under the name Joseph Carter. He was dating a single mother, Amanda Gardner, who was unaware of his {{criminal}} past, and posing {{as the owner of}} a home restoration business. He <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> from a wealthy family, and his silver 2005 Infiniti and [...] "fashionably decorated bungalow" [...] seemed to confirm this. Cox used a falsified passport to travel to Europe on a cruise of the Greek Isles with Gardner. He did not spend much time in Italy or Greece due to his intense fear of Interpol. He was reported by Gardner's 60-year-old babysitter, Patsy Taylor. She became suspicious of Cox, so she researched him online, where she discovered his true identity. Taylor was put in contact with the attorney of Rebecca Hauck by a St. Petersburg Times reporter. Hauck's family paid Taylor for Cox's address, as this information could be used to reduce Hauck's sentence. He temporarily escaped capture due to a chance series of events. Cox and Gardner's home was burglarized, and they checked into a hotel. On November 16, 2006, Cox was arrested by a half dozen Secret Service agents—who had been pursuing him for more than two years—when he and Gardner returned from the hotel. He had been building Williamson a house using his fake identity and credit history, but, fortunately for his friend, he was arrested before Williamson could give him a down payment. Hauck's sentence was later reduced from 70 to 42 months {{as a result of her}} assistance in Cox's capture.|$|E
500|$|Police interrogated Garza at a San Antonio motel {{where he}} claimed to have a {{landscaping}} business in Mexico, though police suspected that he was a drug dealer. After further questioning, Garza admitted on March 31, 1993, he had made arrangements to have Fischer killed. He told the police he confessed because he was troubled by what he had done. He was not arrested immediately because investigators needed more information from him to continue with the case. He told investigators that it started when he visited a local fortune teller after he separated from his wife in 1992. The fortune teller, María Mercedes Martínez de Sánchez, consulted with Garza for several sessions in an attempt to repair the relationship he had with his wife. Garza's son was born with muscular dystrophy and his wife was depressed, to the point where she wanted to kill herself and their son. Investigators said that Garza believed his wife's relatives had cast a spell on their marriage and he needed Martínez's help. They discovered that Martínez promised to help Garza if he agreed to help kill Fischer. Garza confirmed to the police Martínez was working with a [...] "client" [...] (Cisneros) who wanted Fischer, along with anyone who got in the way, dead. Cisneros visited her at least three times to consult with her after the break-up. During their first meeting, Cisneros wanted to know if Fischer felt anything for her daughter. Martínez read through her cards and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> no longer in love with Cristina. Cisneros paid US$5 for the card reading and left the shop upset with Martínez's answer.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, {{she met the}} Archbishop of Boston Cardinal Bernard Francis Law, on an {{official}} visit to the US.

[...] "His remarks were utterly inappropriate and unwelcome," [...] she said. McAleese told the cardinal that she was the [...] "President of Ireland and not just of Catholic Ireland". At this point, a heated argument ensued between the two, according to McAleese.|$|E
60|$|Then Cynthia was called. She {{was waiting}} anxiously {{in the passage}} for the {{interview}} to be ended, {{and when she came}} in one glance at <b>her</b> father's face <b>told</b> <b>her</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> happier. She, too, was happier.|$|R

2500|$|Des died 6 December 2005. [...] On that day, his son took a {{phone call}} from James J. Houlihan in America, looking to take the arm and display it there.

[...] In February of the following year, he called the widow Josephine and <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going to have an exhibition entitled [...] "Fighting Irishmen: A Celebration of the Celtic Warrior". [...] She was not interested at the time believing that he would take the arm and she would never see it again. [...] He kept on writing her, phoning her, and asking her to look at his website. [...] Convinced that he was an honorable, respected man, she agreed to put the trip in motion.|$|E
2500|$|On June 30, {{the defense}} called Krystal Holloway, a {{volunteer}} {{in the search}} for Caylee, who stated that she had had an affair with George Anthony, that he had been to her home, and that he had texted her, [...] "Just thinking about you. Ineed you in my life." [...] She told the defense that George Anthony had told her that Caylee's death was [...] "an accident that snowballed out of control." [...] Under cross-examination by prosecutors, they pointed to her sworn police statement in which she had said that George Anthony believed it was an accident, rather than knowing that it was. In her initial report, Holloway reported George Anthony saying, [...] "I really believe that it was an accident that just went wrong and (Casey Anthony) tried to cover it up." [...] She said he had not <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> present when the alleged accident occurred. During redirect examination, Baez asked Holloway if George Anthony had told her that Caylee was dead while stating publicly that she was missing, to which she replied yes.|$|E
2500|$|Hill's {{murder trial}} began on February 15, 1971, before Judge Frederick Hooey. The case was prosecuted by McMaster and Ernst, while Hill was defended by Richard Haynes. Robinson Hill's friend and {{neighbor}} Vann Maxwell {{was the first}} witness to give evidence, and testified that Robinson Hill had said shortly before her death that she {{had given up on}} her marriage. Kurth testified against Hill, claiming that he had tried to kill her on June 30, 1969, by crashing their car into a bridge, and by injecting her with a hypodermic syringe. She also told the court that he had confessed to killing Robinson Hill. Kurth claimed to have seen three petri dishes in the bathroom of John Hill's apartment during the time Joan Robinson Hill became ill. [...] She said they had [...] "something red in them" [...] and when she asked Hill about it, he <b>told</b> <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> conducting an experiment. Kurth testified that Hill was annoyed at her discovery and the next day, when she found some pastries in the apartment's refrigerator, he became annoyed again, telling her not to eat them.|$|E
