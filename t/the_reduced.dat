Current schedulers of MapReduce/Hadoop are quite successful in achieving data locality and scheduling <b>the</b> <b>reduce</b> tasks with a greedy algorithm. Some jobs may have hundreds of map tasks and just several reduce tasks, in which case, <b>the</b> <b>reduce</b> tasks of <b>the</b> large jobs require more time for waiting, which {{will result in the}} starving problem of the small jobs. Since the map tasks and <b>the</b> <b>reduce</b> tasks are scheduled separately, we can change the way the scheduler launches <b>the</b> <b>reduce</b> tasks without affecting the map phase. Therefore we develop an optimized algorithm to schedule <b>the</b> <b>reduce</b> tasks with <b>the</b> shortest remaining time (SRT) of the map tasks.
