The operator runs the trolley over the ship <b>to</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> <b>cargo,</b> usually containers. Once the spreader locks onto the container, the container is lifted, moved over the dock, and placed on a truck chassis (trailer) {{to be taken to}} the storage yard. The crane also lifts containers from chassis on the dock to load them onto the ship.|$|E

When they stopped he was exhausted by the heat and the strain of watching and did not go with Brown.|$|E
