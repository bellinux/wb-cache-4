She ends their relationship when she discovers his infidelity and turns her attention <b>to</b> <b>Joseph,</b> {{who had tried to}} warn her about Sam's indiscretion. She supports Joseph when he is tormented by Jac about the relationship she had had with his father prior to his death. When STI clinician Tim attacks staff members with a crossbow, Faye is shot in the back, but makes a full recovery. She reveals <b>to</b> <b>Joseph</b> that she was formerly married to a much older man named Donald, who left her a substantial amount of money after his death from cancer. She is investigated by the police, who find it suspicious that she has been twice widowed. Her stepson, Carl Hewson, blackmails her for money, but is later attacked by loan sharks and dies in theatre.|$|E

5|$|Jennings {{died of a}} heart attack, {{most likely}} brought on by another bout with jaundice, on July 26, 1834, at his farm near Charlestown. He was fifty years old. Jennings was buried after a brief {{ceremony}} in an unmarked grave. His estate lacked the funds to purchase a headstone. Jennings's creditors, many of whom were his neighbors, were left unpaid and disgruntled. Following Jennings's death, Tipton sold the Jennings farm <b>to</b> <b>Joseph</b> Carr and gave Jennings's widow a $100 gift from the proceeds.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{name for}} the museum was simply the American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, though before opening it was additionally named after Copia, the Roman goddess of wealth and plenty. According <b>to</b> <b>Joseph</b> Spence in Polymetis (1755), Copia is a name {{used to describe the}} goddess Abundantia in poetry, and was referred to as Bona Copia in Ovid's Metamorphoses.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} and {{an adaptation of}} Washington Irving's story of Rip Van Winkle. The stage adaptation was well-known and the adaptation would be compared <b>to</b> <b>Joseph</b> Jefferson's portrayal on the stage. The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The adaptation differs from the original in some ways, including that Winkle's cantankerous wife has remarried instead of died.|$|E

The tunnels also house memorials <b>to</b> <b>Joseph</b> Kennedy, the other bomber crew members killed during raids on the site, and the forced labourers who lost their lives during construction. In 2011, the museum had about 11,000 visitors, of whom 53% were French, 18% Belgian and 16% British.|$|E
5|$|Venture kept to {{a steady}} {{bimonthly}} schedule for ten issues, but its circulation never reached a sustainable level, and it was canceled in mid-1958. The large number of competing magazines probably hurt sales, though {{since many of the}} competitors lasted for only one or two issues, Venture {{can be thought of as}} at least a partial success. An anthology drawn from the magazine's fiction, No Limits, was published in 1964 by Ballantine Books, attributed <b>to</b> <b>Joseph</b> Ferman as editor.|$|E

As the release of information to third parties was also controlled by the Quebec Agreement, discussion then turned to what scientific details would be revealed in the press announcement of the bombing.

5|$|A {{survey by}} {{archaeologist}} Howard Thomas in 1979 unearthed {{a number of}} medieval potsherds {{in the vicinity of}} the farmhouse and found evidence of continuous occupation of the island including middens containing numerous animal bones along with oyster and cockle shells. Fragments of green glazed jugs and flagons from the late 12th to 13th century and shards of pottery from the 14th century were also found on the island. The presence of Pennant sandstone roofing tiles and a fragment of a 14th-century glazed ridge tile indicate the existence of a substantial medieval building, possibly a chapel, demolished when the present farmhouse was constructed. Property records from 1542 show that King Henry VIII granted a lease to farm the island to a gentleman by the name of Edmund Tournor. His family remained on Flat Holm until the end of the 17th century when the lease passed <b>to</b> <b>Joseph</b> Robins.|$|E
5|$|As a consequence, Austria {{withdrew from}} the Coalition. Although France had not {{completely}} defeated them, the Treaty of Sch√∂nbrunn, signed on 14 October 1809, imposed a heavy political, territorial, and economic price. France received Carinthia, Carniola, and the Adriatic ports, while Galicia was given to France's ally Poland. The Salzburg area went to the French ally, Bavaria. Austria lost over three million subjects, about 20 percent of her total population, which dramatically reduced the military force that Austria could field. Francis also agreed to pay an indemnity equivalent to almost 85 million francs, gave recognition <b>to</b> <b>Joseph</b> Bonaparte as the King of Spain, and affirmed Habsburg participation in Napoleon's Continental System. Francis reluctantly agreed to Napoleon's marriage with his daughter, Marie Louise, which Napoleon assumed, incorrectly, would eliminate Austria as a future threat.|$|E

5|$|Black Hawk {{and most}} {{of the leaders of the}} British Band were not {{immediately}} captured following the conclusion of hostilities. On 20 August, Sauk and Fox under Keokuk turned over Neapope and several other British Band chiefs to Winfield Scott at Fort Armstrong. Black Hawk, however, remained elusive. After fleeing the battle scene with White Cloud and a small group of warriors, Black Hawk had moved northeast toward the headwaters of the La Crosse River. The group camped for a few days and was eventually counseled by a group of Ho-Chunk, which included White Cloud's brother, to surrender. Though they initially resisted the pleas for surrender, the group eventually traveled to the Ho-Chunk village at La Crosse and prepared to surrender. On 27 August 1832, Black Hawk, White Cloud and the remnants of the British Band surrendered <b>to</b> <b>Joseph</b> M. Street at Prairie du Chien.|$|E
5|$|Chadderton Hall Park is {{a public}} park by the River Irk {{in the north of}} Chadderton, {{spanning}} an area of over , in what were once the gardens of the manorial Chadderton Hall.

The hall was demolished in 1939. The park is now owned by Oldham Council, the local authority, and was opened to the public in 1956. It was awarded Green Flag status in 2006.|$|E

Having moved to Lexington at the age of seven, Dennie returned to Boston in 1783 to study bookkeeping and later clerk in a counting house. He began preparing to enter Harvard College in 1785, under the guidance of Reverend Samuel West. West had a significant impact on Dennie, fostering his pupil's interest in literature, as well as instilling in Dennie a decidedly pro-British mindset.|$|E

5|$|Hans-Martin Schenke, {{starting}} from {{an analysis of}} , in which Jesus encounters a Samaritan woman at the town Sychar, made an extensive analysis of the ancient sources, together with {{an examination of the}} site. The curiosity of the Gospel text for scholars lies in the mention of an otherwise unattested town in the field, and the failure of the text to refer to Joseph's Tomb, despite mentioning the field Jacob allotted <b>to</b> <b>Joseph,</b> and Jacob's well. In Schenke's view, {{from the beginning of the}} Hellenistic period down to the 1st century CE, when the author of John's gospel was presumably writing, the grave commemorating Joseph stood by Jacob's Well. This grave was shifted, together with the sacred tree and Jacob's field, sometime between that date and the earliest testimony we have in the Bordeaux itinerary in 333 CE., which locates it elsewhere, by Shechem/Tel BalƒÅ·π≠a.|$|E

While they were there, his friend, Nazi Party official Karl Hanke, recommended the young architect <b>to</b> <b>Joseph</b> Goebbels to help renovate the Party's Berlin headquarters. Speer agreed to do the work. When the commission was completed, Speer returned to Mannheim and remained there as Hitler took office in January1933.|$|E
5|$|In Cleveland, the Bears started strong after Demontre Hurst intercepted Brian Hoyer's pass, {{which led}} to Robbie Gould's field goal, {{followed}} by Jordan Palmer's touchdown pass <b>to</b> <b>Joseph</b> Anderson, which Cleveland retaliated with James Michael-Johnson intercepting Trent Edwards and scoring. Late in the game, the Bears led 16‚Äì9, and Sherrick McManis intercepted Hoyer, who made up for the pick by throwing a touchdown pass to Dan Gronkowski. Later, Armonty Bryant forced Harvey Unga to fumble, which was recovered by Cleveland's L. J. Foyt, {{which led to}} Spencer Lanning kicking the go-ahead field goal to put the Browns up 18‚Äì16. With {{a little over a}} minute left in the game, Gould missed a 57-yarder wide left, giving Cleveland the win.|$|E
