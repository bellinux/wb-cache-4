40|$|On-line {{continuous}} monitoring of pulverised coal in fuel injection pipelines will allow power plant operators <b>to</b> understand <b>fuel</b> <b>conveying</b> conditions {{and ultimately to}} achieve higher combustion efficiency and lower pollutant emissions. This paper presents the design, implementation and trials of an instrumentation system for on-line non-intrusive measurement of pulverised coal in a power plant environment. An array of three identical electrostatic electrodes is housed in a sensing head to determine multiple measurement results from different electrode pairs. Flow parameters such as flow velocity, relative mass flow rate and fuel distribution between injection pipes {{can be obtained by}} fusing the multiple results. On-plant trials on 488 mm bore pneumatic conveying pipelines at a 600 MW coal-fired power plant were undertaken following preliminary system evaluation tests on a 50 mm bore laboratory test rig. Experimental results demonstrate that monitoring of pulverised coal flow is achieved using the developed instrumentation system under real industrial conditions. The developed technology is likely to find immediate applications, leading to improved performance of coal-fired power plants, efficient use of fuel, and subsequent reductions in emissions...|$|R
40|$|On-line {{continuous}} monitoring of pulverized coal in fuel injection pipes will allow power plant operators <b>to</b> optimize <b>fuel</b> <b>conveying</b> conditions {{and ultimately to}} achieve higher combustion efficiency and lower atmospheric emissions. This paper presents the design, implementation and trials of a prototype instrumentation system for the on-line measurement of pulverized coal on a full-scale power plant. An array of three identical arc-shaped electrostatic electrodes is housed in a sensing head to derive particle flow signals. Pulverized coal flow parameters such as velocity, mass flow rate and fuel distribution among the injection pipes from the same pulverizing mill are obtained by processing the signals and fusing the resulting measurements. On-plant demonstration trials on 560 mm bore pneumatic conveying pipes feeding a 600 MW boiler were undertaken following system evaluation tests on a 50 mm bore laboratory test rig. Experimental results demonstrate that reliable monitoring of pulverized coal flow parameters is achieved and {{that the system is}} able to track both transient and long-term fluctuations of pulverized coal flow in fuel injection pipes under real power plant conditions...|$|R
5000|$|In April 2013, Jones {{announced}} plans for a Koran burning event to be held on September 11, 2013. In Iran, Pakistan, and at an Interfaith Conference in Vienna there have been calls for the United States government to stop this event. Army General Lloyd Austin III, commander of US Central Command called Jones on September 9, 2013, to ask him cancel the event, however Jones declined. Police arrested Jones on September 11, 2013, before he could burn 2,998 Korans soaked with kerosene at a park in Polk County, Florida. He was charged with unlawfully <b>conveying</b> <b>fuel</b> and openly carrying a firearm. [...] The charge of unlawfully <b>conveying</b> <b>fuel,</b> made against both Jones and Marvin Wayne Sapp, who was driving, was dismissed in October, 2014 by Circuit Court judge Roger Alcott, who wrote [...] "For purposes of the legal analysis, {{the nature of the}} books in the grill does not matter... It would not matter if the materials in the grill were books, oak wood or BBQ briquettes. The material facts simply do not demonstrate a violation of Florida statutes." [...] This dismissal was upheld by the Second District Court of Appeals in June, 2015.|$|R
