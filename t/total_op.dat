40|$|An {{attitude}} is a mental state that influences {{the way an}} individual responds to relevant objects and situations. Attitudes toward the elderly have a potential impact on all Americans, as the population is growing older. These attitudes constitute an important area of study because their nature is unclear and their impact extensive. The Kogan Attitudes Toward Old People Scale (OP) was examined to establish reliability and validity estimates. A questionnaire, consisting of this scale and four others, was administered {{to a sample of}} adults. Factor analysis of the OP revealed two factors, which were somewhat ambiguous. Internal consistency estimates for these factors and the <b>total</b> <b>OP</b> ranged from. 72 to. 92. Validity estimates were in the expected direction and ranged from -. 13 to. 36.

40|$|Organophosphorus (OP) {{insecticides}} {{are used}} worldwide, yet their persistence {{in the environment}} is not well understood. This paper summarises recent research on 17 OP insecticides in the River Wuchuan, an important catchment in China, by determining their concentrations in water, soil, sediment and plants by gas chromatography with flame photometric detection (GC-FPD). The concentrations of the <b>total</b> <b>OP</b> insecticides ranged from 92. 77 to 229 ng l(- 1) in river water, 1. 61 to 9. 93 ng g(- 1) dry weight in soil, 1. 24 to 7. 56 ng g(- 1) dry weight in sediment and 75. 28 to 326 ng g(- 1) dry weight in plants. There was a relatively high abundance of methamidophos, dichlorvos, malathion, omethoate and dimethoate in all water, soil, sediment and plant samples. On average, these five compounds collectively accounted for 64 %, 71 %, 71 % and 54 % of the <b>total</b> <b>OP</b> insecticide concentration in water, soil, sediment and plants, respectively, which {{was similar to the}} composition of OP insecticides in application formulations used in our study area and in China as a whole. The results therefore reflect the application pattern to some extent, and suggest that the sources of the OP insecticides are mainly from current usage. When compared with other areas, the levels of OP insecticides in the River Wuchuan were moderate. The animal and human risks from exposure to OP insecticides in water and plants were evaluated against relevant threshold values. The results therefore provide important information on the current contamination status of a key agricultural watershed in China, and point to the need for urgent action to control the use of some excessively applied and potentially persistent agrochemicals, such as methamidophos, omethoate and dimethoate...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} the study was to assess non-dietary {{exposure}} of workers and the general population in the Paris area to some organophosphorus (OP) pesticides. In total, 21 workers from different occupational places (two greenhouses, three florist shops and three veterinary departments) and 20 subjects assumed to be non-occupationally exposed were recruited. Indoor air, hand wipes, and three first morning urine samples were collected. Seven OPs were measured by GC/ECD and GC/TSD, and six urinary dialkylphosphate metabolites by GC/PFPD. All indoor air samples from the workplaces and only one-third of the samples from the residences contained at least one of the seven OPs. However, almost all participants were dermally exposed to OPs. <b>Total</b> <b>OP</b> indoor air and cutaneous levels were significantly higher for workers than for the general population (air median = 185 pmol/m(3) Versus nondetectable, P< 0. 0001; hands median = 1250 pmol/hands versus 475 pmol/hands, P = 0. 03). From the air, gardeners and florists were mainly exposed to methyl-OPs and veterinary staff to ethyl-OPs (mainly diazinon). From their hands, all subjects were exposed to methyl-OPs, with gardeners and florists exposed to somewhat but not significantly higher levels. Ethyl-OPs were more found frequently and at higher levels on the hands of veterinary workers. <b>Total</b> <b>OP</b> levels in indoor air and from hand wipes were significantly correlated (Spearman R = 0. 34, P = 0. 03). DAP detection frequencies and levels were not different between workers and the general population (workers median = 168 nmol/g creat and general population median = 241 nmol/g creat, P= 0. 31), and did not correlate with air or hand levels. Subjects not occupationally exposed showed significant residential exposure to OPs, more frequently from their hands than from the air. Different occupations were associated with different exposure profiles and levels. The lack of differences in DAP levels between the different groups of exposure suggests that dietary exposure to OP residues and exposure to other OPs are involved...|$|E

The contents of the <b>total</b> <b>OPs</b> (17) ranged from 134. 8 to 354. 6 ng/l (the mean is 227. 2 ng/l). Total OCs concentrations varied from 115. 4 to 414. 7 ng/l in water (mean 237. 7 ng/l). The levels of total hexachlorocyclohexane in water varied from 31. 95 to 129. 8 ng/l (mean 62. 51 ng/l), and those of total DDTs were in the range 19. 24 - 96. 64 ng/l (mean 48. 69 ng/l).

While the OCs mainly came from early application and were more stable. The ON did not have obvious correlation with the dissoved organic carbon and suspended particulate matter at water from JLRE.

40|$|An {{automated}} {{analytical system}} {{was developed for}} measuring the oxidative potential (OP) with the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay of filter extracts that include both water-soluble and water-insoluble (solid) aerosol species. Three approaches for measuring total oxidative potential were compared. These include using methanol as the solvent with (1) and without (2) filtering the extract, followed by removing the solvent and reconstituting with water, and (3)  extraction in pure water and performing the OP analysis in the extraction vial with the filter. The water extraction method (the third approach, with filter remaining in the vial) generally yielded the highest DTT responses with better precision (coefficient of variation of 1 – 5  %) and was correlated with {{a greater number of}} other aerosol components. Because no organic solvents were used, which must be mostly eliminated prior to DTT analysis, it was easiest to automate by modifying an automated analytical system for measuring water-soluble OP developed by Fang et al.  (2015). Therefore, the third method was applied to the field study for the determination of <b>total</b> <b>OP.</b> Daily 23  h filter samples were collected simultaneously at a roadside (RS) and a representative urban (Georgia Tech, GT) site for two 1 -month study periods, and both water-soluble (OP WS-DTT) and <b>total</b> (<b>OP</b> Total-DTT) OP were measured.

40|$|Nanostructured biosensors for the {{determination}} of organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) are fabricated by a layer-by-layer assembly technique. In the biosensors, bi-enzymes of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and choline oxidase (ChOx) are used as biological receptors, while CdTe quantum dots (QDs) are explored as fluorescent probes for optical transduction of the enzymatic activity. Increasing amounts of OPs lead to a decrease of the enzymatic activity and thus {{a decrease in the}} production of hydrogen peroxide, which can quench the fluorescence of the CdTe QDs. The decrease of quenching rate is relative to the concentration of OPs. Using this biosensor, monitoring of three types of commonly used OPs (paraoxon, dichlorvos and parathion) at picomolar levels is realized. The linear range of detection covers six orders of magnitude (10 − 12 to 10 − 6 M). In addition, the biosensors exhibit a similar limit of detection and calibration curves for these pesticides, which allow them to be used for the accurate determination of <b>total</b> <b>OPs</b> and carbamate content (not the sum of anti-acetylcholinesterase toxicity as obtained by standard cholinesterase inhibition assay) of mixtures of OPs and carbamate pesticides.

This study {{examined}} the influence of temperature (10, 20, and 30 degrees C) on the acute toxicity and accumulation of two organophosphate (OP) insecticides and a narcotic chemical to the midge (Chironomus tentans). OP insecticides {{used in this study}} included chlorpyrifos and m-parathion, and pentachlorobenzene was the chosen narcotic.

A reverse trend was noted for <b>total</b> <b>OP</b> insecticide body residues with decreased concentrations found at the higher temperatures. Pentachlorobenzene body residues remained constant at all temperatures. All three chemicals showed increased uptake rates at 20 and 30 degrees C in comparison to 10 degrees C. The noted decrease in midge body residues at the higher temperatures for the OP insecticides was contributed to increased biotransformation and elimination rates at the higher temperatures. Overall, temperature had a greater influence on OP toxicity than for pentachlorobenzene, and {{this may be due to}} accelerated biotransformation of the OPs to more toxic o-analog metabolites at the higher temperatures. peer reviewe...|$|E

This paper represents an attempt to study the source and transportation of such pollutants in estuarine and coastal environments as an integrated ecosystem, by determining the levels of 18 OCl insecticides, 21 PCB congeners, and 17 OP insecticides in the Pearl River Estuary and South China Sea. The total concentrations varied from 126 – 1198 ng l 21 for OCl insecticides, 33. 38 – 1064 ng l 21 for PCB congeners, and 4. 44 – 6356 ng l 21 for OP insecticides in the Pearl River Estuary. In comparison, their levels in the South China Sea were significantly lower, varying from 57. 09 – 202 ng l 21 for OCl insecticides, 21. 72 – 144 ng l 21 for PCBs, and 1. 27 – 122 ng l 21 for OP insecticides, respectively.

40|$|Background. Occult {{pneumothorax}} (OP) is a pneumothorax not visualised on a supine chest X-ray (CXR) but detected on {{computed tomography}} (CT) scanning. With increasing CT use for trauma, more OP may be detected. Management of OP remains controversial, especially for patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. This study aimed {{to identify the}} incidence of OP using thoracic CT as the gold standard and describe its management amongst Hong Kong Chinese trauma patients. Methods. Analysis of prospectively collected trauma registry data. Consecutive significantly injured trauma patients admitted through the emergency department (ED) suffering from blunt chest trauma who underwent thoracic computed tomography (TCT) between in calendar years 2007 and 2008 were included. An OP {{was defined as the}} identification (by a specialist radiologist) of a pneumothorax on TCT that had not been previously detected on supine CXR. Results. 119 significantly injured patients were included. 56 patients had a pneumothorax on CXR and a further 36 patients had at least one OP [OP incidence 30 % (36 / 119) ]. Bilateral OP was present in 8 / 36 patients, so <b>total</b> <b>OP</b> numbers were 44. Tube thoracostomy was performed for 8 / 44 OP, all were mechanically ventilated in the ED.

Located at its upper stream, Zhengzhou city {{is regarded as the}} major discharge source to this river with its annual effluents containing 726 kg for nonylphenol (NP) and 30. 2 kg for octylphenol (OP). The concentrations of NP and OP in surface water ranged from 75. 2 to 1520 ng L - 1 and from 20. 9 to 63. 2 ng L - 1, respectively. To assess the behavior of APs along the river, a mass balance equation based on chloride was adopted, due to its relative conservation. The results showed that dilution effect was prevailing in determining the APs concentrations in surface water along the river. The effect of potential biodegradation was also estimated with an assumption of the optimized biodegradation. The contributions of dilution and biodegradation to the decline of APs concentrations were 38. 8 %, 23. 7 % for NP and 57. 8 %, 24. 3 % for OP, respectively. The other contribution to the decline of APs concentrations along the river was considered as an integrated effect of adsorption and air-water exchange with the values of 37. 5 % for NP and 17. 9 % for OP. The decay half-lives of NP and OP from surface water bodies were 1. 6 and 2. 4 d, respectively. About 70. 2 % of total NP and 24. 1 % of <b>total</b> <b>OP</b> were finally eliminated from water phase to surrounding matrix in the downstream.

40|$|Abstract only availableFaculty Mentor: Dr. Bo Lei, BiologyPurpose: Oscillatory {{potentials}} (OPs) {{are high}} frequency, low amplitude wavelets embedded on the ascending limb of the electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave. In human, the bandwidth for OPs recording was recommended at 75 ~ 300 Hz. We studied the frequency spectrum {{and the energy}} of the OPs in mammals. Methods: Albino (Balb/c) and pigmented (C 57 BL/ 6) mice, New Zealand White albino rabbits, cats, and rhesus monkeys were studied. Dark-adapted ERGs were recorded with a bandwidth range of 0. 1 ~ 1000 Hz. We removed the low frequency a- and b-wave contaminations and extracted the OPs digitally with a Butterworth bandpass filter. The extracted OPs were analyzed by Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to estimate the power spectrum and then converted to a single-sided power spectrum. Summed OPs amplitude (V), peak frequency power (analogous to power of mechanical vibration, in (V*sec) 2) and band area energy (V 2 sec, numerical integration of the power spectrum) were measured. Results: In frequency domain, albino and pigment mice have one major component at 105. 8  10. 27 (meanSTD) and 102. 24  13. 31 Hz respectively. Cats have two peaks at 69. 4  3. 47 and 133. 15  3. 89 Hz. Rabbits and monkeys show multiple peaks. In rabbit, the peaks are at 85. 95  12. 22, 114. 91  13. 35, 152. 46  19. 63 and 194. 11  18. 22 Hz. And in monkey the peaks are at 75. 5  3. 27, 137. 87 and 161. 63 Hz. For OPs power analysis, summed OPs amplitude, peak frequency power and energy are highly correlated. In these animals, mice have the highest OPs energy at 705  269. 48 (meanSTD, V 2 sec, albino) and 508. 46  178. 05 (pigmented).

OPs frequency spectrum patterns are different between species. Frequencies of some OPs components are beyond the bandwidth range used in human study. Therefore we suggest adjusting the frequency bandwidth for different species. 2. Multiple frequency peaks may imply different mechanisms. 3. Mice have the highest OPs and may be a good model for OPs study. This project was completed as part of a Capstone requirement...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} pathological changes in brain tissues of Frisien Holstein dairy cattle affected by organophosphate (OP). The study was directed to anticipate spongiform encephalopathy. Samples consisted of animal feeds, sera and brain tissues were collected from Lembang, West Java. Animal feeds (fodders and commercial feed) were collected directly from the dairy farms around Lembang. Sera (31 samples) were from dairy cattle owned by the local farmers and brain tissues were from the local animal slaughter house. Pesticide residues were analysed following a standard procedure using gas chromatography (GC). There was an interaction between pesticide residues in animal feeds, residue level of pesticides in sera and brain tissues to cause encephalopathy in dairy cattle. Pesticide contamination in animal feeds was regarded as the source of encephalopathy in dairy cattle. The <b>total</b> average of <b>OP</b> residues (16. 8 ppb) were lower than organochlorines/OC (18. 7 ppb) in fodder, showing that pesticides were originated from the contaminated soils.

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this dissertation, a {{dissipative}} quantum dot (QD) -cavity system coupled to a longitudinal acoustic (LA) phonon reservoir is studied using a numerically exact real-time path-integral approach. Three distinct dynamical regimes of weak (WC), strong (SC), and coherent coupling (CC) are discussed and more accurate conditions identifying them are presented. Our results show that to have the CC regime, which is characterized by clear vacuum Rabi oscillation (VRO), vacuum Rabi splitting (VRS) should be larger than the sum of the widths of the corresponding peaks. In order to distinguish between contributions of population decay and impure dephasing, induced by LA phonons and the dissipations, on the quantum dynamics of the QD-cavity system, we propose a two-part phenomenological expression which fits the QD-cavity decay curves perfectly and is used to calculate the corresponding spectra. The emission rate increases from the carrier recombination rate to a maximum value, which is the mean of the QD and cavity dissipation rates, with QD-cavity coupling strength. We introduce a quantity that can be applied in determining the distinct coupling regimes; This quantity enables us to identify the onset of the SC regime as the point where the impure dephasing term begins to contribute to the central band of the spectrum significantly, as a result of the existence of VRO with a very small frequency (unclear VRO) at the corresponding decay curve. Its contribution to the width of the central band increases with the coupling strength up to the onset of the CC regime, then reduces as a result of the appearance of sidebands in the spectra. The effective population decay and impure dephasing rate contribute solely to the width—of the central and sideband peaks of the triplet spectra respectively—only beyond a very large coupling strength which is the same across the considered temperature range. In the second part, we demonstrate that all the available experimental data of temperature (T) -dependent shift of photoluminescence (PL) peak of In(Ga) As QD samiii ples can be modeled successfully by using a two-oscillator model if and only if the whole temperature interval (0 – 300 K) is divided into a few parts (at most four parts), depending on dispersion degree of the PL peak from a monotonic behavior. Analysis of the numerical results show that excitons mostly interact (inelastically) with acoustic (AC) or optical (OP) phonons separately. Increasing QDs uniformity, by using some improved growth techniques, results in decreasing or removing the sigmoidal behavior, enhancing total AC phonon contribution to the redshift of the PL peak. Elevation of the zero bandgap (ZBG) energy up to a critical value about 1. 4 eV, for In(Ga) As QDs grown using molecularbeam epitaxy, results in enhancement of QD symmetry and <b>total</b> <b>OP</b> phonon contribution and reduction of QDs uniformity and total AC phonon contribution, while a rollover happens for further increase of the ZBG. Therefore we find that the highest QD symmetry and the lowest exciton fine structure splitting correspond to this critical value of ZBG, in accordance with previous experimental results...|$|E
40|$|In T cells, {{two members}} of the Dok family of adaptor proteins, Ook- 1 and Ook- 2, are {{predominantly}} expressed. Recent evidence suggests that they play a negative role in T cell signaling. In order to define whether Dok proteins regulate T cell development, we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing Ook- 1 in thymocytes and peripheral T cells. For sorne expcriments wc also used mice deficient for the expression of both Dok- 1 and Dok- 2. In this research project we show that Ook overexpression negatively regulates the activity of the key components downstream ofTCR signaling such as LAT, ZAP- 70, PLC-y and Erk. We also show that the overexpression of Ook- 1 causes a dramatic reduction in the numbers of <b>total,</b> <b>OP</b> and SP thymocytes with an increase in the numbers of thymocytes in the DN stage, compared to WT controls. Further investigations indicated that this reduction is not due to an increased apoptosis in OP thymocytes in Ook- 1 transgenic mice but rather a delay in the transition of thymocytes from the C 04 -C 08 - (ON) to C 04 +C 08 + (OP) stage. More precisely, Ook- 1 overexpression results in a block inside the ON stages by arresting thymocytes transition from ON 3 a to ON 3 b which are considered to be respectively the pre- and post- selection stages of T cell development. Moreover, Ook- 1 overexpression promotes the development of yô T cells in the thymus, spleen, and li ver of the transgenic mice. This developmental promotion correlates with the lev el of Ook- 1 overexpression and it is mainly due to the specifie expansion of the V y 1. 1 + V 6. l'. subset of yô T cells. Similar to their small population in WT mice, this expanded population of Vyl. 1 + V 6. 3 + T cells in Ook-l Tg mice have also innate properties including rapid IL- 4 production following stimulation. They express the transcription factor PLZF and they require SLAM-associated adaptor protein (SAP) for their development. Therefore, we concluded that Dok- 1 promotes the development of yô NKT cells. Moreover, Ook- 1 overexpression iii promotes the generation of an innate-like CD 8 + T cell population. These cells express the transcription factor Eomesodermin, upregulate memory markers like CD 44 and CD 122 and produce IFN-y upon first stimulation. Thymie overproduction of IL- 4 by y 8 NKT cells is likely responsible for the innate conversion ofCD 8 + thymocytes in Dok- 1 Tg mice. We pursue our study to further characterize NKT cells by studying the signaling pathways that might be important for their development and maturation. We investigated the contribution of CD 28 signaling in the functional development of ap and yô NKT cells in mice. We show that CD 28 signaling promotes the thymie maturation of PLZF+ IL- 4 producing NKT cells without any effect on their positive selection. Our results also show that CD 28 signaJing positively regulates the LF A- 1 expression on both ap and yô NKT cells. Using mixed bone marrow chimeric mice, we demonstrated that the developmental defect of yô NKT cells in CD 28 - deficient mice is cell autonomous. Moreover, in both wild type C 57 BL/ 6 and Dok- 1 transgenic mice (with increased number of yô NKT cells), we show that the C 028 -mediated regulation of thymie IL- 4 producing NKT cells promotes the differentiation of Eomes + CD 44 high innate-like COS+ T cells. Taken together, these findings reveal previously unappreciated mechanisms by which Dok- 1 and C 028 can be considered as important regulators of the innate immune response via controlling the NKT cell homeostasis and consequently the size of the immte-like C 08 + T cell pool...|$|E
40|$|The {{foraging}} {{activities of}} the termite Constrictotermes cyphergaster were investigated in the Caatinga of northeastern Brazil. Eight colonies were monitored during fifteen days during each trimester between January 2016 and June 2017 to evaluate the foraging (use-area, intensity, duration) and storage dynamics (weight / nutrition) of that species by examining their feeding behavior. The forage use-area was larger in the rainy season (F 4, 57 = 3. 231, P < 0. 05). The same trend was not observed {{in terms of the}} foraging intensity (F 3, 50 = 2. 641, P = 0. 06) and duration of foraging activity (F 4, 66 = 1. 543, p = 0. 2), which was not found to be significantly different during the different sampling periods. Workers and soldiers showed significantly higher protein and lipid contents during the rainy season (10. 65 ± 4. 38 µg/µL and 87. 3 ± 48. 81 µg/µL respectively), with body biomass increases of 0. 057 ± 0. 043 µg.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze the species {{composition}} and functional groups of the ant community and to assess the efficiency of two sampling methods, pitfall and leaf litter sampling, in an urban park. A total of 1, 401 ants were collected, which belonged to six subfamilies and 36 species. The predominant species was Wasmannia auropunctata (present in 45. 36 % of the samples), while the functional group of opportunistic ants were the most frequent (present in 83. 75 % of the samples) and abundant (95. 29 % of the total col-lected specimens) functional group. The Jaccard Similarity Index showed a low similarity between the two sampling methods, as the difference {{of the number of}} individuals for each species between these two methods was not significant in only one case (Linepithema sp. 1, p = 0. 4561). The fungus-growing and cryptic ants were more collected in leaf litter samples (p< 0. 0001; p = 0. 0348 respectively).

40|$|Blumofe and Leiserson [6] {{gave the}} first provably good work-stealing work {{scheduler}} for multithreaded computations with dependencies. Their scheduler executes a fully strict (i. e., wellstructured) computation on P processors in expected time [mathematical formula], where T denotes the minimum serial execution {{time of the}} multithreaded computation, and T. denotes the minimum execution time with {{an infinite number of}} processors. This thesis extends the existing literature in two directions. Firstly, we analyze the number of successful steals in multithreaded computations. The existing literature has dealt with the number of steal attempts without distinguishing between successful and unsuccessful steals. While that approach leads to a fruitful probabilistic analysis, it does not yield an interesting result for a worst-case analysis. We obtain tight upper bounds on the number of successful steals when the computation can be modeled by a computation tree. In particular, if the computation starts with a complete k-ary tree of height h, the maximum number of successful steals is [mathematical formula]. Secondly, we investigate a variant of the work-stealing algorithm that we call the localized work-stealing algorithm. The intuition behind this variant is that because of locality, processors can benefit from working on their own work. Consequently, when a processor is free, it makes a steal attempt to get back its own work. We call this type of steal a steal-back. We show that under the "even distribution of free agents assumption", the expected running time of the algorithm is [mathematical formula]. In addition, we obtain another running-time bound based on ratios between the sizes of serial tasks in the computation. If M denotes the maximum ratio between the largest and the smallest serial tasks of a processor after removing a <b>total</b> of <b>O(P)</b> serial tasks across all processors from consideration, then the expected running time of the algorithm is [mathematical formula]. by Warut Suksompong.

The OPs present in feedstock materials may either be degraded during composting or stabilized in the compost by sorption interactions with organic matter (OM), which may reduce the availability of OP to microorganism degradation. It is particularly important to identify the key stages during composting {{that are involved in}} OP mineralization so as to be able to optimize the composting process and determine whether OP sorption on OM is a limiting factor to OP mineralization. Four 14 C-labeled OPs were used during the study: a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (fluoranthene), two surfactants (4 -n-nonylphenol – NP and sodium linear dodecylbenzene sulfonate – LAS) and a herbicide (glyphosate). The potential for compost microflora to degrade OP, and compost sorption properties, were characterized at different stages of composting. The highest levels of LAS and glyphosate mineralization were found during the thermophilic stage, at the beginning of maturation for NP {{and at the end of}} maturation for fluoranthene. A specific microflora was probably involved in the biodegradation of fluoranthene while NP, LAS and glyphosate mineralization were linked to <b>total</b> microbial activity. <b>OP</b> sorption on compost was linked to their hydrophobicity, decreasing in the order: fluoranthene > NP > LAS > glyphosate.
