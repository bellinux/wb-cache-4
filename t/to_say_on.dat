The Torah has little <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>on</b> the subject of survival after death, {{but by the time}} of the rabbis two ideas had made inroads among the Jews: one, which is probably derived from Greek thought, is that of the immortal soul which returns to its creator after death; the other, which is thought to be of Persian origin, is that of resurrection of the dead.|$|E

The Doctor arranges for Ralph Cornish and Liz to return the ambassadors to their own people, so that the three human astronauts can be released.|$|E

Between 2007 and 2013, the number of graduates in physical sciences, biological sciences and agriculture dropped, even though {{the total number of}} university graduates progressed by 19% (to 39 654). Recent data reveal that Israeli educational achievements in the core curricular subjects of mathematics and science are low in comparison to other OECD countries, as revealed by the exam results of Israeli 15-year olds in the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment. Public spending on primary education has also fallen below the OECD average. The public education budget accounted for 6.9% of GDP in 2002 but only 5.6% in 2011. The share of this budget going to tertiary education has remained stable at 16–18% but, as a share of GDP, has passed under the bar of 1%. There is concern at the deteriorating quality of teachers at all levels of education and the lack of stringent demands on students to strive for excellence.|$|E

500|$|Rossen {{was already}} ill {{when he started}} on his final film, Lilith (1964), and it was poorly {{received}} in the United States. After it Rossen lost interest in directing, reportedly because of conflicts with the film's star, Warren Beatty. The filmmaker said, [...] "It isn't worth that kind of grief. I won't take it any more. I have nothing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>on</b> the screen right now. Even if I never make another picture, I've got The Hustler on my record. I'm content to let that one stand for me." [...] However, {{at the time of}} his death Rossen was planning Cocoa Beach, a script he conceived in 1962, showing the hopes and struggles of transients in a local community and contrasting this with nearby Cape Canaveral, which Neve described as a [...] "symbol of America's imperial reach".|$|E
500|$|The 1878 Bland-Allison Act and the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890 {{required}} {{the government to}} buy large quantities of silver and strike it into coin.

[...] Free silver was very popular among Nebraskans, though many powerful Democrats opposed it. [...] After his election to Congress, Bryan studied the currency question carefully, and came to believe in free silver; he also saw its political potential. [...] By 1893, Bryan had become a leading supporter of free silver, arguing in a speech in St. Louis that the gold standard was deflationary [...] "making a man pay a debt with a dollar larger than the one he borrowed...

Apart from some vocal contributions from Linda, McCartney is a one-man album, with McCartney providing compositions, instrumentation and vocals. In 1971, he collaborated with Linda and drummer Denny Seiwell on a second album, Ram. A UK number one and a US top five, Ram included the co-written US number-one hit single [...] "Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey". Later that year, ex-Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine joined the McCartneys and Seiwell to form the band Wings. McCartney had this <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>on</b> the group's formation: [...] "Wings were always a difficult idea... any group having to follow [...] success {{would have a hard}} job... I found myself in that very position. However, it was a choice between going on or finishing, and I loved music too much to think of stopping." [...] In September 1971, the McCartneys' daughter Stella was born, named in honour of Linda's grandmothers, both of whom were named Stella.|$|E

500|$|Lead singer Raine Maida {{first brought}} {{up the idea of}} a concept album after {{excerpts}} from the book began influencing his songwriting. Passing time on the road, he had amassed a backlog of songs and had begun to record demos. He jokingly suggested an album title of Kurzweil. [...] "That was not the most graceful sounding name in the world, so we went with Spiritual Machines instead," [...] Turner said. While the other band-members were less enthusiastic about the idea due to its weighty subject matter, Maida and Turner decided to pursue it and Turner contacted Ray Kurzweil via email to ask for permission to use the title of his book for their project. Kurzweil's excitement at the prospect prompted them to invite him to record spoken excerpts from his book for the album and a correspondence developed. “I think it’s amazing that Ray Kurzweil sent us a bunch of pieces, and for whatever reason, they really tie in with what we were trying <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>on</b> this record,” said Maida.|$|E

The June 2007 announcement of a two-month-long nationwide tour with Silverchair, Across the Great Divide tour, followed {{the release of}} Dream Days at the Hotel Existence. Powderfinger were involved in philanthropic causes. In 2005, they performed at a WaveAid concert in Sydney, to help raise funds for areas affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Another performance at the Sydney Opera House in October 2007 raised funds for breast cancer victims and their families. One aim of their Across the Great Divide Tour was to promote the efforts of Reconciliation Australia, and awareness of the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children. In April 2010 Powderfinger announced {{that they would be}} breaking up after their Sunsets Farewell Tour, declaring it would be their last ever as they had musically said everything they wanted <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>On</b> 13 November 2010, they played their last concert, signifying their disbandment.

500|$|Repentless {{received}} generally positive reviews on Metacritic. Writing for Exclaim!, Greg Pratt {{said that}} Repentless [...] "isn't {{going to be}} one of the classic Slayer albums, but there's still plenty of good thrash to be found." [...] Journalist J.C. Maçek III of Spectrum Culture wrote [...] "The truth is that it might be easy to dismiss Slayer after almost 35 years as a nostalgic metal act. This would be a travesty and a mistake. Slayer not only has something new <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>on</b> Repentless, but a new way to say it." [...] AllMusic writer Thom Jurek gave the album three out of five stars, calling Repentless [...] "a retro, workmanlike effort from a band determined to soldier on, and that's fine. There are hardcore devotees who never want their favorite bands to change; this is for them. But again, given all that's transpired since 2009, Slayer get points for even pulling this off." [...] The Guardian stated that [...] "Slayer have always been a model of consistency and a band that fans of vicious, vein-bursting heavy metal can rely on." [...] Kim Kelly, writing in Spin was less enthusiastic, calling the album [...] "middling" [...] and stating that it [...] "mostly falls flat." ...|$|E

[...] Chesapeake was the first settlement in Steuben Township, but it faded away so early that even an 1883 county history has little <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>on</b> the subject. [...] Brisco was never large, though it did have a school house from the 1850s through the 1920s. It likewise disappeared {{by the end of}} the 20thcentury.
