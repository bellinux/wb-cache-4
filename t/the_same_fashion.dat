5|$|The {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy III combines {{elements of}} the first two Final Fantasy games with new features. The turn-based combat system remains in place from the first two games, but hit points are now shown above the target following attacks or healing actions, rather than captioned as in the previous two games. Auto-targeting for physical attacks after a friendly or enemy unit is killed is also featured for the first time. Unlike subsequent games in the series, magical attacks are not auto-targeted in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>fashion.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{second novel}} in the Alexis Carew series, Mutineer, by J. A. Sutherland, takes {{nearly the entire}} account of the mutiny, down to the gasket being a source of {{contention}} for Midshipman Carew, {{and puts it in}} a science fiction setting involving a futuristic HMS Hermione under the command of a Captain Neals. In the novel, Carew takes the place of Midshipman Casey. Neals demonstrates his cruelty in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>fashion</b> as Pigot. Neals orders Carew to kneel and beg for forgiveness, and he disrates her and has her flogged when she refuses.|$|E
5|$|PS90 USG: The PS90 USG is now discontinued. In <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>fashion</b> as the P90 USG, {{this model}} has an {{aluminium}} reflex sight housing with a revised reticle. The black reticle {{consists of a}} tiny dot inside of a small ring, which is joined by three posts that glow red in low light conditions due to tritium-illumination. The USG reflex sight can be removed and replaced with a special MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail mount for attaching a different sight, and like other models of the PS90, the USG was available with either an olive drab or black frame. As of 2011, the PS90 USG model is no longer listed by FNH USA, but the USG reflex sight is still offered as a standalone accessory.|$|E
5|$|Scully later {{runs into}} the author at a church. He admits sending Scully the pendant and {{discusses}} with her the Sacred Heart of Jesus. She leaves, visibly shaken. Scully meets Mulder and relays her most recent encounter with the writer to Mulder. Later, Padgett woos Scully into his apartment with more character revelations. Mulder bursts in and arrests him based on accurate descriptions of the case murders in his novel, which he secretly read after discovering it in the mail. While Padgett is in custody, Maggie is murdered in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>fashion</b> as Kevin. This establishes a de facto alibi for the author. Lacking concrete and connective evidence to the murders, and hoping Padgett might lead them to his partner in crime, Mulder releases Padgett from custody.|$|E

Two of the territorial governors (marked with *) resigned their office to serve as territorial delegates.|$|E
5|$|Southern {{business}} owners sought {{to reproduce the}} profitable arrangement of slavery with a system called peonage, in which disproportionately black workers were entrapped by loans and compelled to work indefinitely because of their debt. Peonage continued well through Reconstruction and ensnared {{a large proportion of}} black workers in the South. These workers remained destitute and persecuted, forced to work dangerous jobs and further confined legally by the racist Jim Crow laws that governed the South. Peonage differed from chattel slavery because it was not strictly hereditary and did not allow the sale of people in exactly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>fashion.</b> However, a person's debt—and by extension a person—could still be sold, and the system resembled antebellum slavery in many ways.|$|E
5|$|Stuttgart {{had been}} pitted against English clubs on two {{meetings}} of the same competition, the former over Burnley in the following season. The Germans were knocked out in the opening stage, after being held 1–1, {{in the first game}} at Neckarstadion, before following up with a 0–2 loss at Turf Moor. The latter was opposite Leeds United, in the 1992–93 season of the UEFA Champions League; the club saw themselves be eliminated in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>fashion,</b> as they won 3–0 at home, before losing the second leg 4–1. However, Leeds were awarded an automatic 3–0 win, after Stuttgart were found to have fielded an ineligible player. A play-off in Camp Nou was required to decide the round, which Stuttgart fell with 1–2.|$|E

5|$|Wear of the {{insignia}} is {{according to}} guidelines {{issued by the}} Chancellery of Honours, which stipulate that the badges be worn before most other national orders—that is, {{at the end of}} an individual's medal bar closest to the centre of the chest or at the wearer's neck—with only the Victoria Cross, the Cross of Valour, and the badge of the Order of Merit permitted to be worn before the badges of the Order of Canada. Those in the grades of Companion or Officer may wear their badges on a neck ribbon, while those in the Member group display their insignia suspended by a ribbon from a medal bar on the left chest. Protocol originally followed the British tradition, wherein female appointees wore their Order of Canada emblem on a ribbon bow positioned on the left shoulder. These regulations were altered in 1997, and women may wear their insignia in either the traditional manner or in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>fashion</b> as the men.|$|E
5|$|In the Second Phase, events play in vaguely <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>fashion,</b> {{but there}} are minor variations: Lorica forms an {{alliance}} with Milites rather than being conquered, and while Concordia offers an alliance, Imperial sympathizers within Concordia orchestrate the Queen's death and ally with Concordia. After overcoming Lorica and Concordia, the Rubrum forces storm the Militesi capital and Cid is killed. Before dying, he warns the Cadet and his comrades of the Crystals' role in Orience's cycle. When Tempus Finis arrives, Ace goes alone to find the one mentioned by Cid. He is himself marked as a l'Cie and transformed into Judge Ace. As with the previous cycle, he is defeated, but Tempus Finis arrives and the cycle continues. In a final side story episode, various additional stories revolving around the main cast are revealed. Among the events presented are a talk between Myuria and Arecia as to whether to continue the experiment, and then Lean and Tono are chosen by Arecia to exist outside the cycle and retain their memories. In this new form, the two agree to gather the memories of Orience's people {{and find a way}} of liberating the world from its cycle. The story ends with them wishing the Cadet well, saying that they hope to meet them again in a future cycle.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing in}} GHTV, the player is scored to track their performance, and their scores are {{compared}} to other players - both those playing {{at the same time}} as well as asynchronous scores from other players. To help boost their score, players can accumulate Hero Power in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>fashion</b> as in the GH Live mode. Prior to a song, the player can choose to use Coins, the in-game currency, to purchase one of several Hero Powers which they can deploy during the song, improving their score and performance. Hero Powers include temporary boosts in scoring multipliers, ability to clear all notes for a short distance on the track, or to increase or decrease the density of notes. When a song is complete, the player is ranked based on their performance with the other tracked players, and awarded experience points, Coins, and other bonuses. Experience points are used to raise the player's rank in the GHTV metagame, allowing them to unlock player card skins and other features of GHTV, including Play tokens. Alternatively, players can use the paid, microtransaction currency Hero Cash to purchase access to content. In an update in December 2015, players on GHTV have an opportunity to be randomly pitted in a head-to-head challenge against another player of similar skill level, about twice every half-hour. Winning this head-to-head challenge can give the player an experience point boost.|$|E
