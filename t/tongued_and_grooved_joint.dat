50|$|The Tracta joint {{works on}} the {{principle}} of the double tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>joint.</b> It comprises only four individual parts: the two forks (a.k.a. yokes, one driving and one driven) and the two semi-spherical sliding pieces (one called male or spigot swivel and another called female or slotted swivel) which interlock in a floating (movable) connection. Each yoke jaw engages a circular groove formed on the intermediate members. Both intermediate members are coupled together in turn by a swivel tongue <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> <b>joint.</b> When the input and output shafts are inclined at some working angle to each other, the driving intermediate member accelerates and decelerates during each revolution. Since the central tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>joint</b> are a quarter of a revolution out of phase with the yoke jaws, the corresponding speed fluctuation of the driven intermediate and output jaw members exactly counteract and neutralize the speed variation of input half member. Thus the output speed change is identical to that of the input drive, providing constant velocity rotation.|$|R

50|$|Aboriginals {{had long}} known the Maleny district, on the Blackall Range behind Nambour, {{as an area}} where the {{important}} Bunya Pine (Araucaria bidwilli) grew. The first Europeans to live in the district were transient timber getters who heard from local Aborigines of the huge red cedar (Toona australis) trees on the Blackall Range. While timber was cut, it was not always shifted {{due to the lack of}} roads and steepness of the terrain. The first non-indigenous person to settle in the area was Isaac Burgess, who took up residence on his selection on 1 January 1872; others followed in the late 1870s. They built their homes using pit-sawn timber from their own land. Pits were dug near where the trees stood and there they were sawn down to scantlings and boardings, <b>and</b> afterwards planed, <b>tongued</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> by hand as required.

In order to predict moisture-critical conditions, a properly verified, user-friendly and reliable calculation tool {{that could be used in}} this design phase, is required. This paper initially presents a blind method that could be used in order to verify hyg-rothermal calculation tools in a reliable manner. Furthermore, general results and findings from blind validations of a transient heat and moisture calculation tool carried out in cold roofs are summarized and presented. The comparisons include measurements and calculations of temperature and relative humidity and were carried out in Northern European climates. In general, the results show a good correlation between measured and calculated values. Comparisons show that the studied tool can be used during the design phase to predict moisture risks. However, factors such as the influence of impaired temperature measurements on relative humidity have to be taken into account. There is also a need for outdoor climate boundary conditions that take into account critical periods. Measurements and calculations also established that the most moisture-critical conditions in general occurred in the <b>tongued</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> wooden roof boarding located under the roof membrane.

40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper Lightweight structural sandwich panels made of two thin steel facings, {{which are}} bonded {{to a relatively}} thick and light insulating mineral wool core, are often used for wall claddings. The sandwich panel clad structures are frequently weakened by cut-outs and openings for doors, windows, and in other cases.

The effects of various mechanical and geometrical aspects such as in-plane rigid inter-storey floors, load eccentricities, different types of lateral restraints, openings (e. g. doors or windows) or additional metal stiffeners, are investigated by means of full-scale buckling experiments. Results are then critically discussed and preliminarily assessed via analytical formulations taken from classical theory of plate buckling and column buckling.

If it occurs indoors, it may cause health problems and in cases where mould is outside and fully visible problems become mainly of aesthetic nature. This thesis {{is a part of}} a TCN-project (Mould growth on sapwood boards exposed outdoors: Impact of drying process) which was conducted in 2009 at LTU Skellefteå and SP Trätek. One of the goals of the TCN-project was to reduce mould risk of <b>tongued</b> <b>and</b> <b>grooved</b> boards by temperature treatment. This thesis is a part of that work. The thesis consists of two parts: A. Determine whether heat pressing on the flat sides of unplaned lateral exchange of spruce has any effect on mould susceptibility. Is it possible to make the sugars at the surface and the surface itself less attractive to fungi by contact heating? The work contains the following main elements: § Scanning of wood surfaces with line camera before and after mould test § Heating experiments in veneer press § Mould test in climate chamber § Visual assessment of mould growth with self-made grading system B. Evaluation of the software MouldAnalyser 1. 0. The purpose of the program is to determine percentage of mould growth in scanned RGB images of infested wood surfaces. The wood used in conducted experiments was 22 x 100 mm boards of spruce. The test material consisted of five 30 cm long specimens per group (= 10 surfaces) and nine references (untreated). Three temperatures and three treatment times were selected for the heat pressing. Temperatures: 140 °C, 170 °C and 200 °C Times: 1 min, 3 min and 10 min A total of 9 groups (3 times x 3 temperatures) The mould test lasted for eight weeks in a climate chamber with a relative humidity of 95 % and a temperature of 22 °C. The evaluation of the mould growth was made with a four-point mould scale. Conclusions A. It is possible to make wood surfaces less attractive to mould by contact heating. All three press temperatures and two out of three (3 min and 10 min) press times resulted in significantly lower mean mould growth than the reference group. (All significant differences are at significance level 0, 05). B.

40|$|Plank (tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove)</b> wood decking is {{a product}} that is {{commonly}} used in post and beam timber construction to transfer gravity loads on roofs and floors. In 2010, The National Building Code of Canada changed the application area of the specified concentrated roof live loads from 750 mm x 750 mm to 200 mm x 200 mm. The change was made to better reflect the area which a construction worker with equipment occupies. Preliminary analysis showed that {{the change in the}} application area of concentrated loads may {{have a significant impact on}} the design of decking systems. Little research or development has been done on plank decking since the 1950 ’s and 1960 ’s. An experimental program was undertaken at the University of Ottawa’s structural laboratory to better understand the behaviour of plank decking under uniformly distributed and concentrated loads. Non-destructive and destructive tests were conducted on plank decking systems to investigate their stiffness and failure mode characteristics under uniformly distributed as well as concentrated loads. The experimental test program was complimented with a detailed finite element model in order to predict the behaviour of a plank decking system, especially the force transfer between decks through the tongue <b>and</b> <b>groove</b> <b>joint.</b> The study showed that the published deflection coefficients for uniformly distributed loads can accurately predict the three types of decking layup patterns specified in the Canadian Design Standard (CSA O 86, 2009). For unbalanced uniformly distributed loads on two-span continuous layup, it was found that the deflection coefficient of 0. 42 was non-conservative. It was also found that under concentrated loads, the stiffness of the decking system increased significantly as more boards were added. A deflection coefficient of 0. 40 is appropriate to calculate the deflection for the three types of decking layup patterns specified in the Canadian Design Standard (CSA O 86, 2009) under concentrated load on an area of 200 mm by 200 mm. Significant load sharing was observed for plank decking under concentrated loads. An increase in capacity of about 1. 5 to 2. 5 times the capacity of the loaded boards was found. Furthermore, it was found that placing sheathing on top of a decking system had a significant effect in the case of concentrated load with an increase of over 50 % in stiffness and over 100 % in ultimate capacity...|$|R
