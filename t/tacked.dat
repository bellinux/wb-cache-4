5|$|The 1981 Peach Bowl {{kicked off}} on January 2, 1981 at Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. Unlike the 1966 Liberty Bowl, in which Virginia Tech scored first, it was Miami who {{dominated}} the game's early going. The Hurricanes scored a touchdown {{on the first}} drive {{of the game and}} <b>tacked</b> on another touchdown early in the second quarter. Tech was held scoreless in the early going, thanks to twoMiami interceptions at the goal line as Virginia Tech was threatening to score. Late in the second quarter, Tech was finally able to get on the scoreboard with a field goal, but at halftime, the Miami Hurricanes led 14–3.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} quarter of the game, it {{appeared}} that Virginia Tech would run away with an overwhelming victory. Tech received the ball to begin the game, and on the game's second play, Virginia Tech's Ken Edwards ran 58 yards on a trick play for the game's first touchdown. Mississippi fumbled the ball on its first offensive play and Virginia Tech recovered the turnover. Three plays later, Tech scored another touchdown on a seven-yard run by Terry Smoot. After stopping the Rebels with their defense, Tech appeared to have another chance to score when the Hokies' Ron Davidson returned an Ole Miss punt to the Rebels' 42-yard line. Despite the excellent field position, Tech was unable to score after Hokie quarterback Al Kinkaid was sacked for a 19-yard loss. Despite the setback, Tech was able to keep Ole Miss from scoring in {{the first quarter}} and <b>tacked</b> on a 29-yard field goal by kicker Jack Simcsak before time came to an end in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, Tech led 170.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 May, a British {{squadron}} sailing off La Havre spotted the French ships pulling {{to the west and}} gave chase, Captain Laforey leading in the 38-gun , followed by the bomb vessel , under Captain Robert Fitzgerald, and the 12-gun cutter , under Lieutenant Henry Garrett. Discovering the British in pursuit, Pevrieux ordered his squadron to retreat towards the shore, tacking in front of Hydra and opening an ineffective fire at long range. Laforey continued his approach, and a 06:00 successfully <b>tacked</b> Hydra into a position between Confiante and Vésuve, which had turned back towards the shore. Although the British frigate came under fire from both French ships, their attacks had little impact. Laforey was able to concentrate his broadside against Vésuve and rapidly forced the French corvette to turn inshore, pursued by Vesuvius and Trial. Laforey then set off in pursuit of Confiante, which was attempting to turn back towards Le Havre. The French cutter was unable to escape the British pursuit and its crew deliberately drove it ashore near the mouth of the Dives River.|$|E
5|$|The 1996 Orange Bowl {{kicked off}} on December 31, 1996, exactly {{one year after}} the Hokies' {{previous}} bowl game. Instead of New Orleans, however, the Hokies were playing in stormy Miami, Florida at Pro Player Stadium. Neither team scored until late in the first quarter when Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller put Virginia Tech on the board with a 19-yard touchdown pass. The Hokies' 7–0 lead {{at the end of the}} first quarter didn't last long, however. Nebraska scored a field goal early in the second quarter and <b>tacked</b> on a touchdown to take a 10–7 lead halfway through the second quarter. Then Nebraska got its biggest play of the game as Tech's Druckenmiller fumbled the ball. A Nebraska player scooped up the ball, returning it 31yards for a touchdown. Tech was able to score a touchdown before halftime, but Nebraska still held a 17–14 lead as the second half began.|$|E
5|$|Also in {{the region}} was the British 74-gun ship of the line HMS Swiftsure under Captain Benjamin Hallowell, {{a veteran of the}} Battle of the Nile three years earlier. Swiftsure was passing slowly along the North African coast after being {{detached}} from Keith's fleet to join Warren's squadron off Malta, escorting a small convoy en route. Hallowell's ship was understrength as more than 80 men had been removed from the ship for service in Egyptian waters and illness rendered another 59 unfit for duty, while the vessel itself was in a poor state of repair and leaking badly. Progress had been slow, and a northeasterly wind had also significantly delayed Hallowell's passage. When he learned from a passing vessel that there was a French squadron {{in the region}}, he ordered the convoy to separate and sailed for Malta alone in an effort to join Warren more rapidly and warn him of Ganteaume's return. At 03:30 on 24 June his lookouts sighted sails to the southwest. Hallowell immediately assumed that the distant ships were the enemy and he turned away from the French and <b>tacked</b> into the wind. By 05:30, lookouts on the nearest French ships, the ships of the line Jean Bart and Constitution had spotted the distant British vessel and were ordered to give chase.|$|E

5|$|By {{this point}} in the game, Florida State was fully {{committed}} to running down the clock and executed three straight rushing plays to keep the time running out. Virginia Tech was forced to use two of its timeouts to stop the clock, but was eventually successful in forcing a Seminole punt. The kick rolled inside the Virginia Tech 10-yard line before being downed, pinning the Hokies deep in their territory. The first play of Tech's drive was almost a disaster for Virginia Tech, as Marcus Vick fumbled the ball while attempting to avoid a sack. Fortunately for the Hokies, the ball was leapt on by Tech's Duane Brown and the drive stayed alive. Virginia Tech moved the ball downfield through the air with difficulty. Due to the limited time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to rely mainly on passing plays, which stopped the clock when incomplete or were completed for a first down. A 14-yard pass to Josh Morgan and a 10-yard throw to Cedric Humes moved the Hokies to their 47-yard line. Vick then completed a 19-yard pass to Jeff King and Florida State committed a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty on Marcus Vick, which was <b>tacked</b> onto the end of the play. After the penalty, Virginia Tech's offense was deep in Florida State territory, and two plays later, Marcus Vick ran into the end zone on a one-yard quarterback scramble. Rather than attempt another two-point conversion, the Hokies kicked the extra point, and with 1:44 remaining, Virginia Tech had closed the gap to 2722.|$|E
5|$|Dance formed his ships into a line {{of battle}} and ordered {{three or four of}} them to raise blue ensigns and the others red, giving the {{impression}} of a heavy escort by implying that the ships with blue ensigns were warships. This ruse provoked a cautious response from Linois, who ordered his squadron to shadow the convoy without closing with them. During the night, Dance held position and Linois remained at a distance, unsure of the strength of the British convoy. At 09:00, Dance reformed his force into sailing formation to put distance between the two forces and Linois took the opportunity to attack, threatening to cut off the rearmost British ships. Dance <b>tacked</b> and his lead vessels came to the support of the rear, engaging Marengo at long range. Unnerved by the sudden British manoeuvere, Linois turned and retreated, convinced that the convoy was defended by an overwhelming force. Continuing the illusion that he was supported by warships, Dance ordered his ships to pursue Linois over the next two hours, eventually reforming and reaching the Straits of Malacca safely. There they were met several days later by two ships of the line sent from India.|$|E
5|$|Since SMU had {{received}} the ball to start the game, Fresno State got possession to start the second half. The first play from scrimmage of the half was a 38-yard pass from Carr to Burse which got the Bulldogs up to the Mustangs' 41-yard line. The drive stalled from there, however, after a six-yard loss on a pass play, a false start penalty, a pass completed for no gain, and an incomplete pass. After a 42-yard punt that was returned for 4 yards, SMU was set up at their 14-yard line. The ensuing drive for SMU showed promise after they got into Bulldog territory, but an interception by Sean Alston returned for 50 yards to the SMU 15 ended any chance of scoring for the Mustangs. Fresno State finally put points on the board after setting up in the red zone; Carr threw a 6-yard pass to Adams making the score 22-7 after Quentin Breshears <b>tacked</b> on the point after. On the ensuing drive, SMU ran 7 plays for 75 yards in 3:20 in a drive that culminated with a 21-yard touchdown pass from Gilbert to Darius Johnson; the drive included a 27-yard rush by Zach Line {{as well as a}} 19-yard pass from Gilbert to Der'rikk Thompson. After the TD, the score was 29-7 SMU. The teams then exchanged punts {{for the remainder of the}} quarter.|$|E

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to improve patient outcome {{and quality of life}} after laparoscopic ventral hernia repair, resorbable {{fixation}} devices have been developed to allow adequate mesh fixation while minimizing accompanying side-effects as <b>tack</b> erosion and adhesion formation. In experimental set-up, 24 pigs were treated by laparoscopic mesh placement. Two different meshes (PP/ORC and PP/ePTFE) and four fixation devices were evaluated: a 6. 4 mm poly(D,L) -lactide pushpin (<b>tack</b> I), a 6. 8 mm poly(D,L) -lactide with blunt tip (<b>tack</b> II), a 4. 1 mm poly(glycolide-co-L-lactide) (<b>tack</b> III) and one titanium <b>tack</b> (control <b>tack).</b> A first group of animals (n = 12) was euthanized after 2 weeks survival and a second group (n = 12) after 6 months. At euthanasia, a relaparoscopy was performed to assess adhesion formation followed by laparotomy with excision of the entire abdominal wall. Tensile strength of the individual fixation systems was tested {{with the use of a}} tensiometer by measuring the force to pull the <b>tack</b> out of the mesh. Additionally, the foreign body reaction to the fixation systems was evaluated histologically as was their potential degradation. At 2 weeks the tensile strength was significantly higher for the control <b>tack</b> (31. 98 N/cmA(2)) compared to the resorbable devices. Except for <b>tack</b> II, the tensile strength was higher when the devices were fixed in a PP/ePTFE mesh compared to the PP/ORC mesh. After 6 months only <b>tack</b> III was completely resorbed, while <b>tack</b> I (9. 292 N/cmA(2)) had the lowest tensile strength. At this time-point similar tensile strength was observed for both <b>tack</b> II (29. 56 N/cmA(2)) and the control <b>tack</b> (27. 77 N/cmA(2)). Adhesions seem to be more depending on the type of mesh, in favor of PP/ePTFE. At long term, the 4. 1 mm poly(glycolide-co-L-lactide) <b>tack</b> was the only <b>tack</b> completely resorbed while the 6. 8 mm poly(D,L) -lactide <b>tack</b> with blunt tip reached equal strengths to the permanent <b>tack...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractTracking, the pick-up of {{bituminous}} materials by paving equipment tires, can occur when <b>tack</b> coat emulsion was not appropriately applied. This tracking {{can result in}} the existing pavement {{with little or no}} <b>tack</b> coat left in the wheel paths, leading to slippage and delamination. A special <b>tack</b> coat material, trackless <b>tack,</b> which does not track or pick up on paving equipment, has been developed. While researches have been conducted on the trackless <b>tack</b> shear strength evaluation, little work has been done on its cracking performance. Interface cracking performance of one type trackless <b>tack</b> at two application rates was evaluated using the composite specimen interface cracking (CSIC) test. The testing system involves repeated tensile loading and monitoring of the rate of damage development (reduction in stiffness) on composite specimens. Results indicated that trackless <b>tack</b> interface reduced the pavement top-down cracking performance as compared with conventional <b>tack</b> coat. However, it was reported in literature that trackless <b>tack</b> had superior shear strength than conventional <b>tack.</b> Therefore, it can be concluded that both shear strength along the interface and cracking resistance across the interface should be evaluated for any interface bond agents...|$|R
