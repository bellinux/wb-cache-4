2500|$|This {{starting}} material is finely powdered, {{and placed in}} a container within a Verneuil furnace, with an opening at the bottom through which the powder can escape when the container is vibrated. While the powder is being released, oxygen is supplied into the furnace, and travels with the powder down a narrow tube. This tube is located within a larger tube, into which hydrogen is supplied. At the point where the narrow tube opens into the larger one, combustion occurs, with a flame of at least [...] at its core. As the powder passes through the flame, it melts into small droplets, which fall onto an earthen support rod placed below. The droplets gradually form a sinter cone on the rod, the tip of which is close enough to the core to remain liquid. It is at that tip that the seed crystal eventually forms. As more droplets fall onto the tip, a single crystal, called a boule, starts to form, and the support is slowly moved downward, allowing the base of the boule to crystallise, while its cap always remains liquid. The boule is formed {{in the shape of a}} <b>tapered</b> <b>cylinder,</b> with a diameter broadening away from the base and eventually remaining more or less constant. With a constant supply of powder and withdrawal of the support, very long cylindrical boules can be obtained. Once removed from the furnace and allowed to cool, the boule is split along its vertical axis to relieve internal pressure, otherwise the crystal will be prone to fracture when the stalk is broken due to a vertical parting plane.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of vortex-shedding noise was conducted in an acoustic research tunnel over a Reynolds-number range applicable to full-scale helicopter tail-rotor blades. Two-dimensional tapered-chord nonrotating models were tested to simulate the effect of spanwise frequency variation on the vortex-shedding mechanism. Both a <b>tapered</b> circular <b>cylinder</b> and <b>tapered</b> airfoils were investigated. The results were compared with data for constant-diameter cylinder and constant-chord airfoil models also tested during this study. Far-field noise, surface pressure fluctuations, and spanwise correlation lengths were measured for each configuration. Vortex-shedding noise for <b>tapered</b> <b>cylinders</b> and airfoils was found to contain many narrowband-random peaks which occurred within a range of frequencies corresponding to a predictable Strouhal number referenced to the maximum and minimum chord. The noise was observed to depend on surface roughness and Reynolds number...|$|R

50|$|A notable {{technological}} {{triumph of}} the Edison Laboratories was devising a method to mass-produce pre-recorded phonograph cylinders in molds. This was done by using very slightly <b>tapered</b> <b>cylinders</b> and molding in a material that contracted as it set. To Edison's disappointment the commercial potential of this process was not realized for some years. Most of the regional Edison distributors were able to fill the small early market for recordings by mechanical duplication of a few dozen cylinders at a time. Molded cylinders did not become a significant force in the marketplace {{until the end of}} the 1890s, which was when molding was slow and was used only to create pantograph masters.|$|R
50|$|Early plants used {{very large}} lead-lined wooden {{rectangular}} chambers (Faulding box chambers) that were cooled by ambient air. The internal lead sheathing served {{to contain the}} corrosive sulfuric acid and to render the wooden chambers waterproof.

In the mid-19th century, French chemist Gay-Lussac redesigned the chambers as stoneware packed masonry cylinders. In the 20th century, plants using Mills-Packard chambers supplanted the earlier designs. These chambers were tall <b>tapered</b> <b>cylinders</b> that were externally cooled by water flowing down the outside surface of the chamber.|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} study of vortex shedding behind flat plates placed normal to an airstream is presented for Reynolds numbers of O(10 ^ 4). Apart from a parallel-sided plate used as the reference case, all the plates were tapered in the spanwise direction so that the cross-stream width of the plate varied linearly with spanwise distance along it. The data allow significant extension of the conclusions of previously published work and demonstrate that "cellular" shedding occurs in many cases. Within each (spanwise) cell, the shedding frequency is constant despite the changing plate width, and it is shown that the location and extent of the cells are functions {{of the degree of}} taper, the spanwise aspect ratio and the end conditions.

5000|$|The {{most widely}} known {{double-action}} percussion revolver is likely the First Model Adams of 1851. This was unique {{in having a}} double-action-only mechanism, a cylinder that could quickly be removed by pulling forward {{on the front of}} the cylinder pin and slightly tapered cylinders designed to take either proprietary combustable cartridges with a conical bullet designed to fit the <b>tapered</b> <b>cylinder</b> or a round ball. No ramrod was provided. Another unique feature was a safety catch which held the hammer away from the percussion cap under it so it could be carried with all its 5 cylinders loaded unlike the Colt in which one of its 6 cylinders was left uncapped while carried because the hammer would rest on it which could result in a discharge if dropped. An improved version of this is the Beaumont-Adams of 1855 which has a hammer spur and a mechanism which allows single-or double-action operation. The cartridge idea had proved unpopular, so the cylinders were bored parallel for use with ball and powder and a ramrod installed on the left side of the barrel. The Beaumont-Adams differs from the Starr DA in that it is configured for a SA/DA mode. Some sources claim that Starr and Beaumont did not produce enough revolvers to be considered major players in the market. These sources claim that the first widely used DA revolver (sometimes called the first [...] "modern" [...] revolver) was the Colt 1889 [...]38 Government (.38 Long Colt) used by the Navy, and/or the improved version for the Navy and Army, the Colt 1892, because, despite wide adoption, the 1889 model was produced in relatively low numbers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) {{has been}} {{successfully}} utilized in a towing tank facility to measure the fluid field behind a grid of intersecting cylinders, and behind a <b>tapered</b> <b>cylinder.</b> The study was also performed to ascertain the feasibility and applicability of using the Stereoscopic PIV technique in towing tanks, as the setup is now submerged underwater thereby limiting access to the optics once the measurement program is underway, as well as introducing complications to seeding and calibration methods. The primary challenges encountered were ensuring accurate alignment of the optics once the system is submerged, successfully seeding the area of interest in such large volumes of water, and calibrating the system accurately underwater. Results from the PIV measurement on the grid of intersecting cylinders showed {{the interaction of the}} vertical and horizontal wakes shed by the cylinders, and correctly measured that the strength of the vortical structures increased with Reynolds numbers. The results from the <b>tapered</b> <b>cylinder</b> tests showed that the PIV system was able to capture the vortex dislocations present in the vortex sheet behind the cylinder. Overall, the measurements have shown that while performing stereoscopic PIV measurements in towing tank facilities is complex, it is nonetheless feasible and applicable to studying turbulent flow phenomena in such facilities. Consequently, the results from the PIV tests will be incorporated into concurrent numerically calculated results of these two test cases ongoing at the Department of Marine Technology at NTNU.

The approach used LiDAR data to generate a three-dimensional representation of the distribution of tree components (leaves and small branches) by species (based on 1 -$hboxm^ 3 $voxels) and the ground surface. Tree trunks were mapped across a 7. 5 -ha forest stand using a LiDAR-derived height-scaled crown openness index. Primary and secondary branches were modeled as <b>tapering</b> <b>cylinders</b> and linked the canopy voxels to the LiDAR trunks.
