A commonly suggested explanation is that survey respondents exaggerate the severity of health problems and incidence of disabilities in order to rationalize labor force non-participation, application for disability benefits and/or receipt of those benefits. This paper re-examines this issue using a self-reported indicator of disability status from the Health and Retire-ment Study (HRS).

For this subsample we test and are unable to reject the hypothesis that self-reported disability is health and socio-economic characteristics similar to the information used by the SSA in making its award decisions. The unbiasedness restriction implies that these two variables have the same conditional probability distributions. Thus, our results indicate that disability applicant do not exaggerate their disability status at least in anonymous surveys such as the HRS. Indeed, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that disability applicants are aware of the criteria and decision rules that SSA uses in making awards and act as if they were applying these same criteria and rules when reporting their own disability status. ...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Mental {{disorders}} are prevalent diagnoses in disability <b>benefit</b> statistics, with <b>awards</b> often granted at younger age than for other diagnoses. We aimed {{to compare the}} number of lost working years following disability <b>benefit</b> <b>award</b> for mental disorders versus other diagnostic groups. Methods: Data from the complete Norwegian official registry over disability benefit incidence, including primary diagnoses, were analyzed for the period 2001 to 2003 (N = 77, 067), a time-period without any reform in the disability benefit scheme. Lost working years due <b>to</b> disability <b>benefit</b> <b>award</b> before scheduled age retirement at age 67 were calculated. Results: Musculoskeletal disorders were the commonest reason for disability <b>benefit</b> <b>awards</b> (36. 3 %) with mental disorders in second place (24. 0 %). However, mental disorders {{were responsible for the}} most working years lost (33. 8 %) compared with musculoskeletal disorders (29. 4 %). Individuals <b>awarded</b> disability <b>benefit</b> for a mental disorder were on average 8. 9 years younger (46. 1 years) than individuals awarded for a musculoskeletal disorder (55. 0 years), and 6. 9 years younger than individuals awarded for any other somatic disorder (53. 0 years). Anxiety and depressive disorders were the largest contributors to lost working years within mental disorders.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} in the production and interpretation of regulatory science, focusing on the conflicting British and American clinical risk assessments of triazolam (Halcion) - the most controversial sleeping pill in the world. The regulation of triazolam is shown to be more permissive in the USA than in the UK. Six principal socio-political factors are put forward to explain this: differential regulatory trust; regulators' socio-technical data selections; medico-scientific disciplinary influences; organizational and professional interests; conflicts of interest of expert advisers; and the growth of the neo-liberal regulatory state. The risk assessments of both the British and American regulatory agencies are shown to be complacent relative to technical standards which the agencies themselves later accepted. It is suggested that, when the interests of pharmaceutical manufacturers and patients diverge, regulatory assessments are crucially affected by whether regulators are predisposed <b>to</b> <b>award</b> the <b>benefit</b> of the scientific doubts to the manufacturers or patients, and by the balance of such predispositions both within and between regulatory institutions of scientific expertise. The triazolam case indicates that the amount of trust placed in the pharmaceutical industry by the British and American regulatory systems may hamper detection of flaws in manufacturers' medical data in a timely manner and, as a consequence, compromise patients' interests. Some policy implications for drug regulation are sketched...|$|R

Indigenous elites maintained their positions so long as they played their assigned role. In the late eighteenth century, the increased taxation of indigenous put pressure on kurakas allegiances to their own communities and their desire to maintain their status in the colonial order. The 1781 Tupac Amaru rebellion, led by a kuraka, José Gabriel Condorcanqui, known as Tupac Amaru II, was the most serious challenge to the Spanish colonial order in the Andes since the Spanish conquest.|$|R

40|$|M ore than 80 {{percent of}} all nonelderly adults in the United States areinsured against {{the risk of being}} unable to work because of a {{physical}} ormental disability by the Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) pro-gram. To be insured for DI benefits, a person must have worked in a job covered by Social Security in at least five of the ten most recent years. <b>To</b> be <b>awarded</b> <b>benefits,</b> an individual must have a medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is expected to result in death or to last {{for at least a year}} and that prevents the person from engaging in a “substantial gainful activity. ” During the past two decades, the fraction of individuals receiving Disability Insurance benefits has grown substantially, as shown in Figure 1. In 1985, 2. 2 percent of individuals between the ages of 25 and 64 were receiving DI benefits, but by 2005 this fraction had risen to 4. 1 percent. If recent entry and exit rates continue in the years ahead, then more than 6 percent of the nonelderly adult population will soon be receiving DI benefits. The rapid expansion of the beneficiary population has three main causes. First, a set of congressional reforms in 1984 to Disability Insurance screening led to rapid growth in the share of recipients suffering from back pain and mental illness. Because these disorders have comparatively low mortality, the average duration of disability spells—and hence the size of the recipient population—has increased. Second, a rise in the after-tax DI income replacement rate—that is, the ratio of disability income to former labor earnings—strengthened the incentives for work...|$|R

OBJETIVO: Avaliar a chance de deferimento em relação a fatores institucionais, clínicos, sociodemográficos e previdenciários em exames periciais iniciais de requerentes de auxílio-doença com registro de algum transtorno mental como diagnóstico principal em Juiz de Fora-MG. MÉTODO: Considerando as categorias de peritos médicos avaliadores, foram construídos dois modelos de regressão logística buscando caracterizar o peso relativo de diversas variáveis sobre a conclusão médico-pericial. RESULTADOS: Os fatores que se mostraram fortemente associados a maior chance de deferimento foram: segurado avaliado por perito médico sem especialidade em psiquiatria; com diagnóstico de psicoses; na faixa etária de até 29 anos de idade; com outras comorbidades clínicas que não as psiquiátricas, osteomusculares e cardiovasculares; vinculado ao INSS como empregado; e do sexo masculino. DISCUSSÃO: Nos dois modelos estudados, os peritos médicos especialistas em psiquiatria se associaram a menor chance de deferimento. Isto sugere que profissionais especializados na área relativa ao diagnóstico dos segurados sejam mais rigorosos em suas avaliações periciais que os peritos não especialistas.
