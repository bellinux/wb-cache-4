40|$|The {{last two}} decades have brought revolutionary changes in global health, driven by popular concern over AIDS, novel influenzas, and {{maternal}} mortality. Given the rapid globalization that is {{a defining feature of}} today’s world, the need for a robust system of global health law has never been greater. Global health law has been defined as the legal norms, processes, and institutions designed primarily to attain the highest possible standard of physical and mental health for the world’s population. Global health law is not an organized legal system, with a unified <b>treaty</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>body,</b> such as the World Trade Organization. There is, however, a network of treaties and “soft” law instruments that powerfully affect global health—many of which arise {{under the auspices of the}} World Health Organization. See Lawrence O. Gostin, Global Health Law (Harvard University Press, 2014). The WHO is the most important institution for negotiating international health agreements. Despite WHO’s normative powers, modern international health law is remarkably thin, with only two major treaties adopted since the agency’s creation, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and the International Health Regulations. Despite the potential of “soft” and “hard” instruments to set norms and mobilize multiple actors, global health law-making has major limitations: states are loath to constrain themselves and, therefore, often reject international law or agree only to weak norms; high-income states are reluctant to finance capacity building in lower-income states or provide un-earmarked funding to WHO; and compliance mechanisms are often weak or non-existent. However, global health law, despite its limitations, remains vital to achieving global health with justice...|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, and {{of great}} importance, the {{agreements}} {{could result in}} less discriminatory protection of human rights. Although victims of more even and fair protection of human rights {{would not be able}} to receive the same redress for violations as they would against a state (i.e. bringing a complaint before a human rights <b>treaty</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>body</b> or court), since many ceasefire agreements are monitored by the United Nations (which would ideally be the case here), it may be possible for them to gain some redress. The type of redress available would of course depend upon the provisions and circumstances under which the agreement is drafted and the extent to which the parties would consent to be monitored. The fact that the agreements require consent from both parties would, however, increase the legitimacy of the obligations placed on the parties. 37 Concerns as to the (particularly procedural) legitimacy (Ryngaert 2010, 73) of direct human rights obligations for NSAGs could be mitigated by the inclusion of the NSAG in the drafting process and ultimately by their consent in the adoption of the ceasefire agreement. This may also make NSAGs more likely to observe the obligations to which they commit themselves. Indeed, the importance of engaging with non-state actors before requiring certain behaviour of them has been repeatedly stressed (see United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon 2011, cited in International Peace Institute 2012). The importance of engagement is reflected through the work of Geneva Call, which has “demonstrate[d] that constructive engagement with [armed non-state actors] can be effective and can yield tangible benefits for the protection of civilians” (Bongard 2013).|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} 40 years these various {{procedures}} and outputs of the United Nations Human Rights Treaty System (UNHRTS) have gradually become sophisticated, developed and strengthened. It has made {{contributions to the}} promotion and protection of human rights. Despite its achievements, however, it also faces serious challenges and weaknesses, which induces some insider commentators to evaluate it as 'a system in crisis' and to criticise the whole system as one that urgently needs 'a complete overhaul'. From time to time, several proposals were made to improve the situation. However, the underlying problems persisted. Thus further and radical calls for re-organisation of the monitoring mechanism of the UNHRTS into a Unified and Standing <b>Treaty</b> <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Body</b> (USTMB) was made very recently. A further call for consolidation was made more explicit subsequently. In March 2006 the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) has issued a Concept Paper proposing to consolidate the current treaty monitoring bodies (TMBs) into a USTMB {{in an attempt to}} address the persistent problems the UNHTRS monitoring mechanism has been facing. A proposal regarded as too radical by many insiders of the UNHRTS. In view of the serious weaknesses of the UNHRTS monitoring mechanism, the initiated reform is a positive step. However, in seeking to introduce reform, and particularly within the UNHRTS, great caution is important not to throw the baby with water in the reform process. There is real concern about squandering, in the name of reform, the progress achieved over the last decades. In order to introduce an effective reform, {{it is important to be}} aware of [what] has worked and what has not, and make strategic choices based on these insights. In view of the proposed USTMB as a solution to the weakness of the system, balancing the reform initiative so that it will inherit the positive legacies while redressing the weakness is, therefore, a major contemporary concern.

40|$|The United Nations General Assembly in 2006 {{adopted the}} Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), {{sparking}} debate in Africa about the desirability and feasibility of adopting an African pendant to this UN treaty. Two main rationales that support an 'African' treaty {{on the rights}} of persons with disabilities (PWDs) are examined in this article. The first is a process argument that contends that African participation in the elaboration of the CRPD was inadequate. The second, substantive argument suggests that the CRPD, itself, is defective, as it does not adequately address issues pertinent to and reflecting the life world of Africans with disabilities. Concluding that both rationales lack persuasive force, the authors identify two alternative courses of action. First, they argue that the CRPD should be prioritised and used to its fullest extent before attempts are made to elaborate parallel African standards to the CRPD. Among the measures to be prioritised are increased ratification, domestication, presentation of state and alternative civil society reports, and submission of individual complaints. Second, given that all African Union (AU) member states (except South Sudan) are party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, they contend that the existing mechanisms under the African human rights system should first be fully exploited. Although the African human rights system may not have delivered sufficient results when it comes to PWDs, it has taken some tentative steps and has further unexplored potential. There is both a need and the potential for the regional system to play its part in advancing the rights of PWDs. In particular, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights could draw inspiration from the recent adoption of its first General Comment (on art 14 (1) (d) and (e) of the Women's Protocol) to spell out the implications of the African Charter for PWDs. Formulating a new treaty is a complex and time-consuming exercise that will further delay the effective implementation of states' obligations. However, if the option of an African-specific treaty gains wide support, it should {{take the form of a}} protocol to the African Charter, with the African Commission as monitoring mechanism, and not as a separate treaty with a self-standing <b>treaty</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>body.</b> [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{right to}} sexual and {{reproductive}} health (SRH) {{is an essential}} part of the right to health and is dependent upon substantive equality, including freedom from multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination that result in exclusion in both law and practice. Nonetheless, general and specific SRH needs of women living with HIV are often not adequately addressed. For example, services that women living with HIV need may not be available or may have multiple barriers, in particular stigma and discrimination. This study was conducted to review United Nations Human Rights Council, <b>Treaty</b> <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Bodies</b> and Special Rapporteur reports and regional and national mechanisms regarding SRH issues of women living with HIV. The objective is to assess areas of progress, as well as gaps, in relation to health and human rights considerations in the work of these normative bodies on health and human rights. Methods: The review was done using keywords of international, regional and national jurisprudence on findings covering the 2000 to 2014 period for documents in English; searches for the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and national judgments were also conducted in Spanish. Jurisprudence of UN <b>Treaty</b> <b>Monitoring</b> <b>Bodies,</b> regional mechanisms and national bodies was considered in this regard. Results and discussion: In total, 236 findings were identified using the search strategy, and of these 129 were selected for review based on the inclusion criteria. The results highlight that while jurisprudence from international, regional and national bodies reflects consideration of some health and human rights issues related to women living with HIV and SRH, the approach of these bodies has been largely ad hoc and lacks a systematic integration of human rights concerns of women living with HIV in relation to SRH. Most findings relate to non-discrimination, accessibility, informed decision-making and accountability. There are critical gaps on normative standards regarding the human rights of women living with HIV in relation to SRH. Conclusions: A systematic approach to health and human rights considerations related to women living with HIV and SRH by international, regional and national bodies is needed to advance the agenda and ensure that policies and programmes related to SRH systematically take into account the health and human rights of women living with HIV...|$|R

40|$|The {{right to}} enjoying the highest {{attainable}} standard of health {{is incorporated in}} many international and regional human rights instruments. This right contains both freedoms and entitlements, including the freedom to control one's own health and body {{and the right to}} an accessible system of health care, goods and services. Both aspects of the right to health – freedoms and entitlements – have important cultural dimensions. The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has for instance stated that the right to health implies that health facilities, goods and services must be culturally appropriate, in other words respectful of the culture of individuals and communities. At the same time, {{it should be noted that}} culture and health may have a problematic relationship. Cultural patterns, attitudes or stereotypes may severely limit the health freedoms of people or may prevent certain people from accessing health care. Furthermore, there are some cultural or traditional practices that are condoned but that are very harmful to people's health. It seems that international human rights law demands respect for the cultural dimensions of the right to health, while at the same time requiring protection of the right to health against negative aspects of cultures. How does this work out in practice? What does the concept of "culturally appropriate" health goods and services mean at the national level? Who decides on what is or is not culturally appropriate? How have international supervisory bodies elaborated on the freedoms and entitlements of the right to health and the obligations for States Parties to the treaties in relation to the cultural dimensions of the right to health? This article analyses several treaty provisions and the interpretation of these provisions by the <b>treaty</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>bodies.</b> Apart from several UN treaties, several regional treaties in Africa are dealt with, notably the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights.

It is also realised, however, that the identification of a certain practice as harmful by an international body, even if agreed to by the State Party, is not sufficient to eradicate it.

40|$|Nearly {{fifteen years}} ago, Audrey R. Chapman {{emphasized}} the importance of ascertaining violations of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) as a means to enhance its enforcement. Today, the violations approach is even more salient given the recent adoption of the ICESCR’s Optional Protocol, a powerful tool to hold States parties accountable for violations. Indicators are essential tools for assessing violations of economic, social and cultural rights (ESCRs) because they are often the best way to measure progressive realization. Proposed guidelines on using indicators give guidance on the content of States parties reports to <b>treaty</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>bodies,</b> but none creates a framework to assess violations of a specific right in a particular treaty. This article fills this void by providing a framework to assess State compliance that integrates indicators into the project of ascertaining specific violations of economic, social and cultural rights under the ICESCR. The methodology that we propose calls for: 1) analyzing the specific language of the treaty that pertains to the right in question; 2) defining the concept and scope of the right; 3) identifying appropriate indicators that correlate with State obligations; 4) setting benchmarks to measure progressive realization; and 5) clearly identifying violations of the right in question. We illustrate our approach by focusing on the right to education in the ICESCR. In addition to assessing right to education violations, this methodology can be employed to develop frameworks for ascertaining violations of other ESCRs as well...|$|R
40|$|Current {{positive}} {{international law}} does not explicitly recognize a right to humanitarian assistance in disaster situations. The author tries to scope out {{the existence of such}} human right by carrying out a reconnoitering of hard-law instruments, a review of relevant soft-law ones and a snapshot of national practice. She also refers to authoritative doctrine on the issue. Such an examination is circumscribed to ascertaining whether such a right exists or not, for then briefly exploring the question related to its core elements by focusing on {{the very nature of the}} right (individual/collective) and trying to delineate right holders’ entitlements and duty bearers’ obligations using the same analytical framework applied to the right to development. She concludes that while a right to humanitarian assistance is anchored in hard law both at the conventional and customary law levels as it relates to civilians in situations of armed conflicts, the situation is not so crystal clear for those individuals victim of natural disasters in times of peace. The existence of a right to humanitarian assistance would be a sort of umbrella protection for other rights, or better a complementary entitlement to other subsistence human rights rather than a self-standing right per se. This is confirmed by recent human rights standard setting exercises and authoritative views of <b>treaty</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>bodies,</b> which would precisely point in the direction of affirming such a right for victims of natural disasters and consider it as a set of human rights obligations...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the vexed issue of conscientious objection and abortion.

This paper questions the interpretation by the Catholic Church that the clause breaches its right to freedom of conscience and freedom of religion. We argue that the unregulated use of conscientious objection impedes women 2 ̆ 7 s rights to access safe lawful medical procedures. As such, we contend that a physician 2 ̆ 7 s withdrawal from patient care {{on the basis of}} conscience must be limited to certain circumstances.

Finally, the paper turns to the problematic interpretation of conscience and moral responsibility in the context of abortion. We believe that narrow interpretations of conscience must be challenged, in order to incorporate patients 2 ̆ 7 rights to include the choice of abortion and other lawful treatments according to their conscience. We conclude that the conscientious objection provisions in ALRA have achieved the right balance and that there is no justifiable legal reason upon which opponents can challenge the law...|$|R

Council of Europe and European Union systems, the thesis considers the actual and potential impact of these systems on Irish law and policy on integration. The thesis is structured in three parts. The first part addresses the meaning of "integration" and the nature of its relationship with law. It presents an in-depth analysis of the policy framework for integration in Ireland, in light of the definitions of integration developed by the Council of Europe, the EU and UNHCR. This part of the thesis also considers in detail the various dimensions of the relationship between integration and law, and the factors which may shape this engagement. The second part of the thesis analyses the legal foundations of integration at the international, EU and national levels. In the sphere of international law, a nascent integration paradigm as the progressive realisation of equality is identified {{in the work of the}} UN human rights <b>treaty</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>bodies.</b> The role of the concept of integration in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights is also outlined. So too the conflicting concepts of integration evident in EU law and policy are discussed. In the sphere of Irish law, the Irish constitutional framework for integration is analysed by looking at both the values underlying the text of the Constitution and the interpretation of the fundamental rights provisions by the Irish courts in cases involving immigration. The third part of the thesis examines a number of discrete areas of Irish law with strong links to integration, including citizenship, family reunification and the state 2 ̆ 7 s relationship with religion, as a means to consider the relationship between integration and law in the Irish setting...|$|R
40|$|Australia lacks a {{holistic}} instrument that protects human rights. Despite signing and ratifying many international treaties {{designed to protect}} human rights successive federal governments has failed to adequately enshrine these international obligations into domestic law. The current state of human rights protection in Australia is patchwork, representing potential failure to consider human rights in law making and policy development. The constitution does not serve to effectively protect human rights as {{this was not the}} intention of its drafters. The common law cannot directly protect human rights as it is subservient to the express will of parliament. The above factors highlight the dangers of lacking an overarching human rights instruments and the need to address its absence. A dialogue model human rights act created at the federal level would serve to provide better practice for protecting human rights in Australia through removing the parliamentary monologue that exists in interpreting and applying human rights standards. Existing human rights acts possess a commonality of human rights protected and mechanism of fostering dialogue. The human rights acts of New Zealand, The United Kingdom, Canada, Victoria, the A. C. T and chapter two of the South African constitution will provide guidance for developing a human rights act for Australia. They will also provide case studies against which the arguments for and against implementing a human rights act for Australia can be critically examined. Australia has its own unique separation of powers and constitutional system, therefore any legal challenges an Australia human rights acts would encounter will need to be examined in a more abstract and theoretical sense. This thesis will present an argument for the adoption of a federal human rights act for Australia. Such an act should be based on provisions in other acts which are likely to assimilate and survive legal challenge in an Australian context. A human rights act will reduce criticism from human rights <b>treaty</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>bodies,</b> allow Australia to participate in the development of international human rights jurisprudence and allow a better consideration of rights in the provision of public services. Legitimate criticism of dialogue model human rights instruments will also be explored in order to illustrate the counter arguments and their lack of probative value. This thesis will conclude that for the reasons discussed above Australia needs a human rights act in order to develop best practice for human rights protection...|$|R
40|$|Therefore, {{the aims}} of the study are to explore the origin, nature and purpose of fact-finding missions, to explore what is {{currently}} on the ground, to expose the inherent deficiencies in the current practice, which compromise the missions' capacity to promote and protect human and peoples' rights. Having identified the shortcomings, lessons and inspiration will be drawn from the practice and rules of procedure of other regional and international <b>treaty</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>bodies,</b> particularly the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). The starting point of the analysis shall be to identify the various fact-finding related issues that arose in the response of the Government of Zimbabwe to the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR) report. A survey of the reaction and response of other countries in which similar fact-finding missions were conducted, shall be carried out to gauge the consistence or otherwise in the ACHPR's practice. It shall be strongly suggested that the ACHPR should substantially borrow from other human rights systems, if necessary. After closely observing these issues, the study will come up with a position and firm recommendations to the ACHPR in terms of which its practice can be revamped for the achievement of an effective and progressive promotion and protection of human and peoples' rights as contemplated by the African Charter. [...] . This study has four chapters. Chapter one constitutes introductory remarks putting the study into context and the justification thereof. Chapter two explores the nature, origin, forms and importance of fact-finding in human rights protection. It searches for the underlying principles governing credible and plausible fact-finding. Chapter three analyses the ACHPR fact-finding practice to see what is there and critically compare it to the IACHR, UN and ILO practice. It aims at demonstrating {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the African system. Chapter four revisits the weaknesses unearthed in chapter three and proposes recommendations for overall improvement. The study concludes by soliciting draft rules of procedure from the general principles explored in chapter two, combined with lessons learnt from other systems in chapter three. The model fact-finding rules of procedures are marked Annexure A at the end of this work. " [...] Introduction. Prepared under the supervision of Prof. J.

40|$|An {{obligation}} to render assistance {{to those who}} are in distress at sea has long been recognized in international maritime law. Recent developments in international human rights law have also resulted in a greater understanding of states' extraterritorial obligations which have the capability to extend protection to migrants in distress at sea. These human rights obligations are most commonly defined by whether the relevant state exercises 'jurisdiction' over the area, person or event in question. When such jurisdiction is not present, states are relieved of any human rights obligations to take action or for injury caused by their inaction. Yet in many instances they will still feel compelled to act through some form of a latent moral obligation. Often this moral obligation arises out of a desire to assist and protect the world's most vulnerable populations. This paper will explore the dichotomy between these obligations with regard to the perilous position of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea. Specifically it seeks to find the dividing line between where a state's international legal obligations end and where their moral obligations commence. Through analysis of selected jurisprudence concerning the position of migrants at sea, decisions of the main human rights <b>treaty</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>bodies</b> and with a particular focus on the European Court of Human Rights, this paper will attempt to identify the limits of a state's international legal obligations. Consideration will be given to when these obligations arise, how far they extend, what rights and protections are available under them {{and the extent to which}} there is room for further interpretation. The result of this will be an identification of the limits of law's promise in relation to migrants at sea. Beyond the reach of legal obligations lie loosely crafted moral obligations which compel states to assist those persons most in need. Influenced by global policy, security and economics, and characterized by inconsistency in practice, the limits of a state's moral obligations are vastly more uncertain. Through analysis of state efforts, actions and declarations this paper will therefore deconstruct a pattern for when a state's moral obligations will compel them to act with regard to migrants at sea. There exists a grey area between the international legal obligations incumbent on states and the actions which they are willing to take to fulfil their perceived moral obligations. As migrants at sea are most vulnerable within this disconnect a proposal will be made for how this gap can be bridged. The result of this analysis will be a clearer identification of the limits of law's promise in the Global North, particularly towards the most vulnerable populations leaving the Global South...|$|R
