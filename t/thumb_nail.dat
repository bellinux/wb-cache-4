60|$|Artimisia Briggs {{got married}} {{not long after}} refusing me. She married Richmond, the stone mason, who was my Methodist Sunday-school teacher in the {{earliest}} days, and he had one distinction which I envied him: at some time or other he had hit his thumb with his hammer {{and the result was}} a <b>thumb</b> <b>nail</b> which remained permanently twisted and distorted and curved and pointed, like a parrot's beak. I should not consider it an ornament now, I suppose, but it had a fascination for me then, and a vast value, {{because it was the only}} one in the town. He was a very kindly and considerate Sunday-school teacher, and patient and compassionate, so he was the favorite teacher with us little chaps. In that school they had slender oblong pasteboard blue tickets, each with a verse from the Testament printed on it, and you could get a blue ticket by reciting two verses. By reciting five verses you could get three blue tickets, and you could trade these at the bookcase and borrow a book for a week. I was under Mr. Richmond's spiritual care every now and then for two or three years, and he was never hard upon me. I always recited the same five verses every Sunday. He was always satisfied with the performance. He never seemed to notice that these were the same five foolish virgins that he had been hearing about every Sunday for months. I always got my tickets and exchanged them for a book. They were pretty dreary books, for there was not a bad boy in the entire bookcase. They were all good boys and good girls and drearily uninteresting, but they were better society than none, and I was glad to have their company and disapprove of it.|$|E
6000|$|About {{this time}} California was struck with madness. I found him {{dancing on the}} fore-deck shouting, [...] "Isn't she a daisy? Isn't she a darling?" [...] He had found a {{waterfall}}--a blown thread of white vapour that broke from {{the crest of a}} hill--a waterfall eight hundred and fifty feet high whose voice was even louder than the voice of the river. [...] "Bridal Veil," [...] jerked out the purser. [...] "D--n that purser and the people who christened her! Why didn't they call her Mechlin lace Falls at fifty dollars a yard while they were at it?" [...] said California. And I agreed with him. There are many [...] "bridal veil" [...] falls in this country, but few, men say, lovelier than those that come down to the Columbia River. Then the scenery began--poured forth with the reckless profusion of Nature, who when she wants to be amiable succeeds only in being oppressively magnificent. The river was penned between gigantic stone walls crowned with the ruined bastions of Oriental palaces. The stretch of green water widened and was guarded by pine-clad hills three thousand feet high. A wicked devil's <b>thumb</b> <b>nail</b> of rock shot up a hundred feet in midstream. A sand-bar of blinding white sand gave promise of flat country that the next bend denied; for, lo! we were running under a triple tier of fortifications, lava-topped, pine-clothed, and terrible. Behind them the white dome of Mount Hood ran fourteen thousand feet into the blue, and at their feet the river threshed among a belt of cottonwood trees. There I sat down and looked at California half out of the boat in his anxiety to see both sides of the river at once. He had seen my note-book, and it offended him. [...] "Young feller, let her go--and you shut your head. It's not you nor anybody like you can put this down. Black, the novelist, he could. He can describe salmon-fishing, he can."

40|$|The nail-patella syndrome, {{also called}} {{hereditary}} onycho-osteodysplasia, arthro-onycho-dysplasia and onycho-mesodysplasia, {{is of interest}} to clinicians and geneticists because {{of the variety of}} congenital abnormalities. It is easily recognised by the appearance of the finger nails, which are dystrophic or absent. <b>Thumb</b> <b>nails</b> are most commonly involved, other nails becoming progressively less affected towards the little finger. Men often show hemidysplasia of the cubital side of the nail (Montant and Eggermann 1937) whereas women have a small, apparently normal base with the nail gradually fading away so that the flesh {{at the end of the}} finger turns over the nail. Toe nails are usually normal. The patellae are often absent or rudimentary. Usually a triad of anomalies is completed by arthrodysplasia of the elbows (Lester 1936, Senturia and Senturia 1944). A poorly formed and backwardly subluxated head of the radius articulates with a small underdeveloped capitulum. This causes an increased carrying angle, reduction of supination and incomplete extension of the elbow. lliac horns are a frequent manifestation of the syndrome (Fig. 1). These bilateral conical projections arise from the centre of the posterior surfaces of the iliac bones (Kieser 1939...|$|R
6000|$|Murphy was Father Barry's own {{delightful}} discovery. Months {{back the}} priest had engaged the raw Irish boy for household service, then later promoted {{him to a}} post of honor about the altar. To faithful Pat there was little more to ask for outside of heaven. Reports which he sent home to Ireland were set down on paper by Mike, {{who served in the}} upper household. Pat's scribe published his friend's felicity broadcast, until at length even the bishop was fully informed of a popular young priest's affairs. Without thought of injury to one whom he adored, Pat extolled the plans for the great cathedral, which possibly might eclipse St. Peter's at Rome. Again and again the boy dwelt on Father Barry's popularity. To-day as the acolyte looked through the frost-glazed window, scratching wider range with his <b>thumb</b> <b>nail,</b> he had no doubt of his master's chance to become a prelate. Soon the [...] "old one" [...] would pass beyond. He crossed himself devoutly, peering hard at the tall, retreating form, now almost within reach of the corner. An electric line but half a block away was Father Barry's goal. As Pat looked, a gust sent the pedestrian onward with a plunge. As usual, the master carried his own suit case. Murphy muttered disapproval. At the crossing the priest stopped to regain his breath. His sole wish was to catch a car. Owing to the blizzard, traffic might suspend; but in the wind-charged air he thankfully detected a distant hum. The trolleys yet ran. How fortunate! And now very soon he would be with his mother--practically lost to a storm-bound community. How sweet the shelter waiting. Soon he might unburden his heart--pour out his trouble before the only woman in the world who would really understand it. Then again he remembered Isabel Doan--her check, the letter hiding against his breast. After all, should he not restore the generous gift at once? Now that the original cathedral could not be built, was it not a matter of personal honor to explain? Altered conditions cancelled both his own and his friend's obligation. Mrs. Doan must take back her check. That the bishop was powerless to claim the donation filled the priest with vindictive joy. Gradually duty to his mother ceased to govern him. Beyond everything else he wanted to see Isabel Doan. He told himself that he had a right to do so. Honeyed sophistry provided motive for his desire. He stood, as it were, at a point defined by opposing ways. Double tracks glistened before him; one leading eight blocks distant to the lintel of his mother's door; the other, stretching in the opposite direction, across the city--almost to a certain stone mansion. The priest was not in a mood of valiant resistance. Again he longed for Isabel Doan's sympathy. Yet, as he tarried at the crossing, waiting, still undecided which line to choose, he could not dismiss the thought of his mother, even now, watching for her son. He could fancy the dear lady sitting by the window, expectant, disappointed when no car stopped. Her sweet flushed face; the adorable white hair parted and waved on each side of a forehead gently lined by time made a picture which he could not easily dismiss. This mother was his ideal of age. She seemed as rare, as beautiful as an exquisite prayer-rug grown soft and precious with mellow suns and golden years. Many times he had contrasted her with overdressed, elderly women of his parish. He had never wished her to be different in any respect.|$|E
6000|$|This {{that follows}} {{happened}} on the coast twenty miles through the fields from Yokohama, at Kamakura, that is to say, where the great bronze Buddha sits facing the sea to hear the centuries go by. He has been described again and again--his majesty, his aloofness, {{and every one of}} his dimensions, the smoky little shrine within him, and the plumed hill that makes the background to his throne. For that reason he remains, as he remained from the beginning, beyond all hope of description--as it might be, a visible god sitting in the garden of a world made new. They sell photographs of him with tourists standing on his <b>thumb</b> <b>nail,</b> and, apparently, any brute of any gender can scrawl his or its ignoble name over the inside of the massive bronze plates that build him up. Think for a moment of the indignity and the insult! Imagine the ancient, orderly gardens with their clipped trees, shorn turf, and silent ponds smoking in the mist that the hot sun soaks up after rain, and the green-bronze image of the Teacher of the Law wavering there as it half seems through incense clouds. The earth is all one censer, and myriads of frogs are making the haze ring. It is too warm to do more than to sit on a stone and watch the eyes that, having seen all things, see no more--the down-dropped eyes, the forward droop of the head, and the colossal simplicity of the folds of the robe over arm and knee. Thus, and in no other fashion, did Buddha sit in the-old days when Ananda asked questions and the dreamer began to dream of the lives that lay behind him ere the lips moved, and as the Chronicles say: 'He told a tale.' This would be the way he began, for dreamers in the East tell something the same sort of tales to-day: 'Long ago when Devadatta was King of Benares, there lived a virtuous elephant, a reprobate ox, and a King without understanding.' And the tale would end, after the moral had been drawn for Ananda's benefit: 'Now, the reprobate ox was such an one, and the King was such another, but the virtuous elephant was I, myself, Ananda.' Thus, then, he told the tales in the bamboo grove, and the bamboo grove is there to-day. Little blue and gray and slate robed figures pass under its shadow, buy two or three joss-sticks, disappear into the shrine, that is, the body of the god, come out smiling, and drift away through the shrubberies. A fat carp in a pond sucks at a fallen leaf with just the sound of a wicked little worldly kiss. Then the earth steams, and steams in silence, and a gorgeous butterfly, full six inches from wing to wing, cuts through the steam in a zigzag of colour and flickers up to the forehead of the god. And Buddha said that a man must look on everything as illusion--even light and colour--the time-worn bronze of metal against blue-green of pine and pale emerald of bamboo--the lemon sash of the girl in the cinnamon dress, with coral pins in her hair, leaning against a block of weather-bleached stone--and, last, the spray of blood-red azalea that stands on the pale gold mats of the tea-house beneath the honey-coloured thatch. To overcome desire and covetousness of mere gold, which is often very vilely designed, that is conceivable; but why must a man give up the delight of the eye, colour that rejoices, light that cheers, and line that satisfies the innermost deeps of the heart? Ah, if the Bodhisat had only seen his own image! ...|$|E

All her restless, jealous misgivings of months past would then be set at rest! She stood, uncertain, with the letter in her hand. Ah--but if there WERE something! She would lose at one stroke her faith in him, and her faith in herself--not only his love but her own self-respect. She dropped the letter on the table. Could she not take it up to him herself? By the three o'clock slow train, she could get to him soon after five. She looked at her watch. She would just have time to walk down. And she ran upstairs.
