Saxton's mother signed over guardianship of her son to Scientology when he was 16 years old. Saxton was assigned to become a security officer for <b>the</b> <b>organisation.</b> According to Saxton staff in Scientology were not given sufficient drugs or medical attention, and so he removed his own teeth without usage of medication for pain.|$|E

40|$|Successive {{governments in}} Nigeria have adopted {{different}} strategies and programme {{to develop the}} rural areas because {{majority of people in}} the country live and find their livelihood in the rural areas. The paper therefore, set out to compare how the Lower and Upper Benue River Basin and Rural Development Authorities have developed their host communities, to identify the constraints of <b>the</b> <b>organisations</b> in developing rural areas; and to proffer recommendations to the constraints of <b>the</b> <b>organisations</b> in developing their host communities. Primary and secondary data were obtained using questionnaire and documents respectively. The primary data were presented using frequencies and percentages. It was revealed that inadequate funding, poor maintenance culture, staff retrenchment and commercialisation of <b>the</b> <b>organisations</b> have negatively affected their efforts in rural development. It was therefore recommended that government should disburse funds adequately and timely to <b>the</b> <b>organisations</b> and more qualified personnel be recruited into the services of <b>the</b> <b>organisations.</b> Above all, <b>the</b> government and host communities of <b>the</b> <b>organisations</b> should support and be committed to the activities of the River Basin Authorities to facilitate their success. 1. 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION Rural Development has been the preoccupation of many developing countries for a long time because th...|$|R

40|$|Title: Combating {{domestic}} violence in Turkey – An {{analysis of the}} discourses on {{domestic violence}} among organisations in Turkey Author: Jenny Hennecke Advisors: Merete Hellum (Göteborg University, Sweden) Tiiu Soidre (Göteborg University, Sweden) Yakın Ertürk (Middle East Technical University, Turkey) Type of work: Thesis for Sociology, 30 credit points (ECTS) Number of pages: 63 Timeframe: 2007, January – 2008, March Aim of the thesis (objectives and questions) : Domestic violence {{is an important issue}} in Turkey and there are many different organisations combating domestic violence. My interest is to analyse how these organisations perceive domestic violence. This will be done by analysing the socio-cultural context and the discourses on domestic violence that are prevalent in <b>the</b> <b>organisations</b> working with this issue. My research questions are: Which discourses {{can be found in the}} definitions of domestic violence of <b>the</b> <b>organisations?</b> What are <b>the</b> similarities and the differences in the approaches? Which cooperation problems can occur due to the different approaches to domestic violence? Method: To start with, a literature review on the field was done. Later, interviews were conducted with <b>the</b> <b>organisations</b> of interest. Critical Discourse Analysis combined with a feministic perspective was the main tool used for the analysis. Main results: The discourses on domestic violence prevalent in <b>the</b> <b>organisations</b> working on domestic violence in Turkey were largely derived from an !international discourse" on domestic violence. This means that their discourse was in line with international standards and adapted to the Turkish context. However, <b>the</b> <b>organisations</b> were found to be rather elitist and progressive in their views and ways of working whereas the view of most of the population of Turkey, including the politicians, are rather traditional in their way of thinking and acting. The differences in approaches to domestic violence between <b>the</b> <b>organisations</b> seemed to be rather small. The only issue where a different approach could be found was that regarding the involvement of men in <b>the</b> <b>organisations</b> and in <b>the</b> activities of <b>the</b> <b>organisations.</b> Furthermore, there seemed to be a lack of communication and cooperation among <b>the</b> <b>organisations</b> thereby hindering their ability to network, form public opinion and collaborate on projects...|$|R

Although previous management and sport management research have examined a range of environmental and some climate change issues, {{there has not been a}} study of the implications of climate change for major sport stadia – or <b>the</b> <b>organisations</b> that manage them – in Australia, or overseas. Although some management studies have identified climate change specifically as an important problem, little attention has been paid to its physical impacts on sport, and none have considered potential impacts on major sport stadia, or the regulatory and commercial impacts on <b>the</b> <b>organisations</b> that manage them. Equally, few previous studies have examined how sport organisations interpret climate change, contribute to it by way of the direct or indirect generation of greenhouse gas emissions, or respond to its various impacts...|$|R
