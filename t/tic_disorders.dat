5|$|Up to 1% of {{the overall}} {{population}} experiences <b>tic</b> <b>disorders,</b> including chronic tics and transient tics of childhood. Chronic tics affect 5% of children, and transient tics affect up to 20%. Prevalence rates in special education populations are higher.|$|E
5|$|Little {{progress}} was made over the next century in explaining or treating tics, and a psychogenic view prevailed well into the 20th century. The possibility that movement disorders, including Tourette syndrome, might have an organic origin was raised when an encephalitis epidemic from 1918–1926 led to a subsequent epidemic of <b>tic</b> <b>disorders.</b>|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} nature of the {{comorbidity}} of <b>tic</b> <b>disorder</b> and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), patients with <b>tic</b> <b>disorder</b> with or without ADHD were compared on the basis of clinical ratings and neuropsychologic tests. Seventy-eight children were involved in this study: 16 with <b>tic</b> <b>disorder,</b> 19 with comorbid <b>tic</b> <b>disorder</b> and ADHD, 21 with ADHD, and 22 normal controls. Rating scales for ADHD, the Child Behavior Checklist and the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale, were completed in clinical groups. To identify differences in neuropsychologic function among the four groups, the results of seven neuropsychologic tests of global cognitive abilities, attention, information-processing capacity, and fine motor skill were compared. On most behavioral and neuropsychologic tests, the <b>tic</b> <b>disorder</b> with ADHD and the ADHD groups demon-strated similar performance patterns and marked deficits compared with the <b>tic</b> <b>disorder</b> and the control groups, whereas in most of the attention tests, the ADHD group made more commission errors than the <b>tic</b> <b>disorder</b> with ADHD group. These findings suggest that the <b>tic</b> <b>disorder</b> with ADHD group has marked cognitive deficits and behavioral disturbance similar to the ADHD group, whereas the <b>tic</b> <b>disorder</b> group is more similar to the controls. The <b>tic</b> <b>disorder</b> with ADHD group might represent a true comorbidity of the two disorders. (J Child Neurol 2001; 16 : 719 - 726).

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is made based on {{observation of the}} individual's symptoms and family history, and after ruling out secondary causes of <b>tic</b> <b>disorders.</b> In patients with a typical onset and {{a family history of}} tics or obsessive–compulsive disorder, a basic physical and neurological examination may be sufficient.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1990s, a more neutral view of Tourette's has emerged, {{in which}} {{biological}} vulnerability and adverse environmental events {{are seen to}} interact. In 2000, the American Psychiatric Association published the DSM-IV-TR, revising the text of DSM-IV to no longer require that symptoms of <b>tic</b> <b>disorders</b> cause distress or impair functioning, recognizing that clinicians often see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E
5|$|Pre-dating Gilles de la Tourette's 1885 publication, likely {{portrayals of}} TS or <b>tic</b> <b>disorders</b> in fictional {{literature}} are Mr. Pancks in Little Dorrit by Charles Dickens and Nikolai Levin in Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy. The entertainment {{industry has been}} criticized for depicting those with Tourette syndrome as social misfits whose only tic is coprolalia, which has furthered stigmatization and the public's misunderstanding of those with Tourette's. The coprolalic symptoms of Tourette's are also fodder for radio and television talk shows in the US and in the British media.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether the presence of <b>tic</b> <b>disorder</b> is negatively associated with sertraline (SRT) outcomes, but not with continued cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), in a sample of youth who were unresponsive to an initial full course of CBT. Methods: In the Nordic Long-Term OCD Study, children and adolescents with OCD who were rated as nonresponders to 14 weeks of open-label CBT were randomized to continued CBT (n = 28) or SRT treatment (n = 22) for an additional 16 weeks of treatment. We investigated whether the presence or absence of comorbid <b>tic</b> <b>disorder</b> moderated treatment outcomes on the Children’s Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS). Results: Twelve out of 50 (24. 0 %) participants were diagnosed with comorbid <b>tic</b> <b>disorder,</b> with 7 receiving continued CBT and 5 receiving SRT, respectively. In patients without <b>tic</b> <b>disorder,</b> results showed no significant between-group differences on average CY-BOCS scores. However, in patients with comorbid <b>tic</b> <b>disorder,</b> those who received SRT had significantly lower average CY-BOCS scores than those who received continued CBT. Conclusions: Children and adolescents with OCD and comorbid <b>tic</b> <b>disorder,</b> who are nonresponders to an initial 14 week course of CBT, may benefit more from a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) than from continued CBT...|$|R
5|$|Tourette's {{is defined}} {{as part of a}} {{spectrum}} of <b>tic</b> <b>disorders,</b> which includes provisional, transient and persistent (chronic) tics. While the exact cause is unknown, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There are no specific tests for diagnosing Tourette's; it is not always correctly identified because most cases are mild and the severity of tics decreases for most children as they pass through adolescence. Extreme Tourette's in adulthood, though sensationalized in the media, is a rarity; tics are often unnoticed by casual observers.|$|E
5|$|Non-genetic, environmental, post-infectious, or psychosocial factors—while not causing Tourette's—can {{influence}} its severity. Autoimmune processes {{may affect}} tic onset and exacerbation in some cases. In 1998, a {{team at the}} US National Institute of Mental Health proposed a hypothesis based on observation of 50 children that both obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and <b>tic</b> <b>disorders</b> may arise in a subset of children {{as a result of}} a poststreptococcal autoimmune process. Children who meet five diagnostic criteria are classified, according to the hypothesis, as having Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections (PANDAS). This contentious hypothesis is the focus of clinical and laboratory research, but remains unproven.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} Tourette's and no {{medication}} that works universally for all individuals without significant adverse effects. Knowledge, education and understanding are uppermost in management plans for <b>tic</b> <b>disorders.</b> The management of the symptoms of Tourette's may include pharmacological, behavioral and psychological therapies. While pharmacological intervention is reserved for more severe symptoms, other treatments (such as supportive psychotherapy or cognitive behavioral therapy) may help to avoid or ameliorate depression and social isolation, and to improve family support. Educating a patient, family, and surrounding community (such as friends, school, and church) is a key treatment strategy, and may be all that is required in mild cases.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{all people}} with Tourette's have comorbid conditions, most Tourette's {{patients}} presenting for clinical care at specialty referral centers may exhibit symptoms of other conditions {{along with their}} motor and phonic tics. Associated conditions include attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD or ADHD), obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), learning disabilities and sleep disorders. Disruptive behaviors, impaired functioning, or cognitive impairment in patients with comorbid Tourette's and ADHD may {{be accounted for by}} the comorbid ADHD, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating comorbid conditions. Disruption from tics is commonly overshadowed by comorbid conditions that present greater interference to the child. <b>Tic</b> <b>disorders</b> in the absence of ADHD {{do not appear to be}} associated with disruptive behavior or functional impairment, while impairment in school, family, or peer relations is greater in patients who have more comorbid conditions and often determines whether therapy is needed.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{causes of}} tics (not related to {{inherited}} Tourette syndrome) are {{commonly referred to}} as tourettism. Dystonias, choreas, other genetic conditions, and secondary causes of tics should be ruled out in the differential diagnosis for Tourette syndrome. Other conditions that may manifest tics or stereotyped movements include developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and stereotypic movement disorder; Sydenham's chorea; idiopathic dystonia; and genetic conditions such as Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Wilson's disease, and tuberous sclerosis. Other possibilities include chromosomal disorders such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, XYY syndrome and fragile X syndrome. Acquired causes of tics include drug-induced tics, head trauma, encephalitis, stroke, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome may also be confused with Tourette syndrome. Most of these conditions are rarer than <b>tic</b> <b>disorders,</b> and a thorough history and examination may be enough to rule them out, without medical or screening tests.|$|E
5|$|Medication is {{available}} to help when symptoms interfere with functioning. The classes of medication with the most proven efficacy in treating tics—typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), haloperidol (Haldol), pimozide (Orap) and fluphenazine (Prolixin)—can have long-term and short-term adverse effects. The antihypertensive agents clonidine (trade name Catapres) and guanfacine (Tenex) are also used to treat tics; studies show variable efficacy, but a lower side effect profile than the neuroleptics. Stimulants and other medications {{may be useful in}} treating ADHD when it co-occurs with <b>tic</b> <b>disorders.</b> Drugs from several other classes of medications can be used when stimulant trials fail, including guanfacine (trade name Tenex), atomoxetine (Strattera) and tricyclic antidepressants. Clomipramine (Anafranil), a tricyclic, and SSRIs—a class of antidepressants including fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), and fluvoxamine (Luvox)—may be prescribed when a Tourette's patient also has symptoms of obsessive–compulsive disorder. Several other medications have been tried, but evidence to support their use is unconvincing.|$|E

25|$|The {{treatment}} of ADHD {{in the presence}} of <b>tic</b> <b>disorders</b> has long been a controversial topic.

25|$|Patients with Tourette {{syndrome}} who {{are referred}} to specialty clinics have {{a high rate of}} comorbid ADHD.

According to a Cochrane review, evidence for the oral form in schizophrenia is not sufficient to determine effects on general functioning. Additionally, because many people dropped out of the medication trials before they were completed, the overall strength of the conclusions is low.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} social and behavioral problems related to attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessions and compulsions, and tic severity in children with a <b>tic</b> <b>disorder.</b> Parents of 58 children with a <b>tic</b> <b>disorder</b> with and without different forms of ADHD completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the Children's Social Behavior Questionnaire. Patients with a <b>tic</b> <b>disorder</b> with primarily hyperactive-impulsive ADHD had the highest questionnaire scores, patients with primarily inattentive ADHD had medium scores, and patients without ADHD had the lowest scores. On most subscales, significant part correlations with ADHD severity, but not tic severity, were obtained. Severity of obsessions and compulsions was independently correlated with the CBCL Thought Problems subscale but not with most other subscales. There was no significant correlation between tic severity and ADHD severity. Thus, in patients with a <b>tic</b> <b>disorder,</b> the presence and severity of ADHD are the main predictors of associated behavioral and social problems...|$|R
40|$|Objective Increased plasma kynurenine {{has been}} {{reported}} in <b>tic</b> <b>disorder</b> patients, and this observation has been suggested to be indicative of immune dysregulation. In the present study, we examined plasma levels of kynurenine and related molecules in a group of <b>tic</b> <b>disorder</b> patients. Methods Plasma concentrations of tryptophan, kynurenine, cortisol, and neopterin were determined in Dutch <b>tic</b> <b>disorder</b> patients (N = 59), and healthy volunteers (N = 32). Group means were compared and age-controlled intra-individual correlations between tic severity and plasma levels of these molecules were examined. Results No {{significant differences were found between}} patient and control groups in plasma levels of tryptophan, kynurenine, and cortisol concentrations, nor in the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio. However, neopterin was significantly (p = 0. 035) higher in patients (mean = 5. 13 nmol/ 1) than in controls (mean = 3. 30 nmol/ 1). Plasma levels of these molecules did not correlate with tic severity, with the exception of tryptophan (r = - 0. 289, p = 0. 049). In patients, plasma neopterin correlated with kynurenine (r = 0. 438, P = 0. 002); in healthy subjects, tryptophan correlated with kynurenine (r = 0. 670, p < 0. 00 1). Conclusion While the observed elevation in plasma neopterin is consistent with immune activation in a subset of <b>tic</b> <b>disorder</b> patients, metabolism of tryptophan through the kynurenine pathway appears to be unaltered in <b>tic</b> <b>disorder</b> patients...|$|R

25|$|The stimulants are {{the first}} line of {{treatment}} for ADHD, with proven efficacy, but they do fail in up to 20% of cases, even in patients without <b>tic</b> <b>disorders.</b> Current prescribed stimulant medications include: methylphenidate (brand names Ritalin, Metadate, Concerta), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), and mixed amphetamine salts (Adderall). Other medications can be used when stimulants are not an option. These include the alpha-2 agonists (clonidine and guanfacine), tricyclic antidepressants (desipramine and nortriptyline), and newer antidepressants (bupropion and venlafaxine). There have been case reports of tics worsening with bupropion (brand name Wellbutrin). There is good empirical evidence for short-term safety and efficacy for the use of desipramine, bupropion and atomoxetine (Strattera).|$|E
25|$|For example, {{people with}} Tourette {{syndrome}} and related <b>tic</b> <b>disorders</b> make involuntary movements and utterances (called tics) {{despite the fact}} that they would prefer not to do so when it is socially inappropriate. Tics are described as semi-voluntary or unvoluntary, because they are not strictly involuntary: they may be experienced as a voluntary response to an unwanted, premonitory urge. Tics are experienced as irresistible and must eventually be expressed. People with Tourette syndrome are sometimes able to suppress their tics for limited periods, but doing so often results in an explosion of tics afterward. The control exerted (from seconds to hours at a time) may merely postpone and exacerbate the ultimate expression of the tic.|$|E
