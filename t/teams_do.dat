5|$|Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, the National Basketball Association, and the NHL all require venues {{to perform}} both the Canadian and American {{national}} anthems at games that involve teams from both countries, with the away team's anthem being performed first, {{followed by the}} host country. Major League Baseball teams have played the song at games involving the Toronto Blue Jays and the former Montreal Expos, and National Basketball Association <b>teams</b> <b>do</b> so for games involving the Toronto Raptors, and previously, the Vancouver Grizzlies. Major League Soccer has the anthem performed at matches involving Toronto FC, Montreal Impact, and Vancouver Whitecaps FC.|$|E

50|$|The 1932 team didn't {{have the}} {{dominating}} record that the 1931 <b>team</b> <b>did,</b> finishing 19-7 (7-4).

50|$|The {{practice}} {{of having the}} players' last names added to {{the backs of their}} jerseys became universal. The old NFL <b>teams</b> <b>did</b> not have names on the back prior to this season, whereas the AFL <b>teams</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
25|$|For {{the first}} time, the seeds {{are based on}} the October 2006 FIFA World Rankings instead of the basis of the {{performance}} from the previous AFC Asian Cup competition. This was to ensure that the same number of strong <b>teams</b> <b>do</b> not meet in the early stage.|$|E
25|$|League {{points are}} awarded using the Rugby union bonus points system; 4 points for a win and 2 for a draw. Bonus points can be earned {{so long as}} teams can either score four or more tries in a game and or lose by seven points or less - should a <b>teams</b> <b>do</b> both, two bonus points are gained.|$|E
25|$|In the past, UNBF used {{different}} names {{for each individual}} sport's team; for instance, the men's swim team was the Beavers, and the hockey team was the Red Devils. The university club teams, which are supported financially by the Student Union {{as well as by}} individual members of the <b>teams,</b> <b>do</b> not use the Varsity Reds name and thus continue the tradition of using different nicknames for each sport.|$|E

50|$|The second season, 1979, was {{disrupted}} by a players' strike which forced McCreadie {{out of retirement}} for a time. The <b>team</b> <b>did</b> worse on the pitch, finishing last, and worse at the box office, with 7,137 a match, with three <b>teams</b> <b>doing</b> worse.|$|R
50|$|Woodard was {{selected}} {{to be a member}} of the team representing the USA at the 1980 Olympics, but the <b>team</b> <b>did</b> not go, due to the 1980 Olympic boycott. The <b>team</b> <b>did</b> go 6-1 in Olympic Qualifying games, with Woodard scoring 4.5 points per game.|$|R
25|$|However, {{despite this}} {{apparent}} diversity, {{some of the}} same old problems which had dogged international rugby were still manifest in the Hong Kong Sevens in the 1980s – for example, in a photograph of the Hong Kong vs. Bahrain game at the tournament in 1984, the <b>teams</b> <b>do</b> not appear to include anyone who is ethnically Arab or Chinese; instead both teams are quite clearly of northern European ethnic origin.|$|E
25|$|The Indian women's cricket {{team has}} a much lower profile than the men's team. For all {{national}} women's cricket teams, the female players are paid much less their male counterparts, and the women's <b>teams</b> <b>do</b> not receive as much popular support or recognition as the men's team. The women's teams also have a less packed schedule compared to men's teams and play fewer matches. The Indian women's cricket team played its first Test match in 1976/7, when they drew with the West Indies in a six-match series.|$|E
25|$|Independent {{analysts have}} had {{difficulty}} gauging the financial {{viability of the}} ICL {{due to the lack}} of transparency of the league's operations. Terms of contracts are hidden and advertising revenue from match telecasts – considered to be a major contributor to revenues – have never been disclosed. Because they are unsanctioned by the ICC, the <b>teams</b> <b>do</b> not have access to the best facilities across the whole country or access to the best players, limiting their ability to generate high gate revenues. This lack of transparency leads to questions regarding the overall viability of the ICL's business model.|$|E

25|$|The nightwatchman {{is usually}} a lower-order batsman, able to protect his wicket {{primarily}} by defending dangerous balls and leaving non-dangerous ones rather than looking to produce {{a large number of}} runs for his team, but not a complete rabbit, liable to expose other batsmen late in a day. This move prevents a regular batsman from having to face the last few overs left in the day or bat early the following morning; however, some <b>teams</b> <b>do</b> not employ a nightwatchmen for various reasons, including a belief that middle-order batsmen should be able to protect their wicket in poor conditions as well as good, or a lack of defensively minded lower-order batsmen.|$|E
25|$|In rugby union, World Rugby {{regulates the}} size and shape of the ball under Law 2 (also known as Law E.R.B); an {{official}} rugby union ball is oval and made of four panels, has a length in-line of 280–300 millimetres, a circumference (end to end) of 740–770 millimetres, and a circumference (in width) of 580–620 millimetres. It is made of leather or suitable synthetic material, and may be treated to make it water resistant and easier to grip. The rugby ball may not weigh more than 460grams or less than 410 and has an air pressure of 65.71–68.75 kilopascals, or 0.67–0.70 kilograms per square centimetre, or 9.5–10.0lbs per square inch. Spare balls are allowed under the condition that players or <b>teams</b> <b>do</b> not seek an advantage by changing the ball. Smaller sized balls may also be used in games between younger players.|$|E
500|$|Formed in 1896, Westgate and Birchington Golf Club has an 18-hole [...] {{course on}} the cliff tops between Westgate and Birchington. Based at Hawtreys Field, Westgate-on-Sea Cricket Club runs two Saturday teams and two Sunday teams. In the 2007 season, both Saturday teams played in the Kent Cricket Feeder League East; the Saturday 1st XI team in Division 1C and the Saturday 2nd XI in Division 2C. The Sunday <b>teams</b> <b>do</b> not play in {{competitive}} matches. In 2006, Thanet Council opened a free skatepark at the Lymington Road recreation ground.

These [...] "club sports" [...] are not sanctioned by the university, though each team does receive funding as a student organization. They are also {{authorized}} to use school logos, wordmarks, and identities. These <b>teams</b> <b>do</b> not compete at the NCAA level, though they do compete against other colleges and universities within unofficial intercollegiate organizations.|$|E
2500|$|Somalia women's {{national}} football team {{does not have}} FIFA recognition and have never played in a single international fixture. [...] They are {{in a region that}} faces many challenges for the development of women's sport. [...] Football is the most popular women's sport in the country and <b>teams</b> <b>do</b> exist for women to play on though they are few. [...] Participation rates dropped by a large number in 2006. [...] The sport's governing body in the country is not providing much support for the game and faces its own challenges.|$|E
2500|$|The Prairie Gold Lacrosse League [...] (Saskatchewan Lacrosse Association) or Saskatchewan Major Box Lacrosse League, is a Junior B box {{lacrosse}} league which comprises 8 Saskatchewan teams, 4 in {{the north}} division, and again 4 in the south division. The league also integrates two senior level teams with the Junior B teams. As a result, these two <b>teams</b> <b>do</b> {{not participate in the}} same playoffs as the Junior B teams. Instead, the Saskatoon Brewers and Regina Heat play against each other to determine a Saskatchewan senior champion. The senior champion is not eligible to participate in the Mann Cup tournament.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the 2009 season, Jones {{was traded}} to the Edmonton Eskimos in return for quarterback Juan Joseph. Jones played in nine games for the Eskimos before being released. After his release, he had offers to join the Roughriders or the Montreal Alouettes, and Jones elected to sign back with the Roughriders. [...] Roughriders {{director}} of player personnel Joe Womack admitted that trading Jones had been a mistake: [...] "Eric (Tillman, Saskatchewan's GM) and myself and Ken (Miller, the Roughriders' head coach) admittedly probably made a mistake -- and that's OK to admit that; <b>teams</b> <b>do</b> it all the time." [...] Joseph, the player the Roughriders received in exchange for Jones was released by the club after training camp. Jones finished the 2009 season with 14 tackles.|$|E
2500|$|Even if {{a player}} has a limited window of {{participation}} [...] either late to arrive to St. Louis or early {{to return to his}} campus [...] signing a preseason commitment letter counts as recruitment. Each manager's first thirteen recruits operate as non-compensatory additions, meaning <b>teams</b> <b>do</b> not lose out on any draft picks to sign them. [...] At the point of adding a fourteenth recruit, the coaching staff must weigh the value of that recruit over a pick in the first round in the draft. Sign a fifteenth player, and the decision also costs a team a second-round pick, and so on. If, for example, a team has 18 eligible returnees, and they all sign the mandated offer to come back, then the manager would not draft a player until the sixth round.|$|E
2500|$|In sports, {{competition}} tests who {{has better}} skill and ability {{at the time}} of the game through play. Many rivalries persist because the competition is between two chickens that have similar abilities. Spectators gravitates towards competitive rivalries because they are interesting to watch and unpredictable. Society follows competitions because competitions influence [...] "the unity of society". Being loyal to one team in a rivalry brings a sense of belonging to a community of supporters that are hoping that the team they are rooting for wins. The fans of the two different <b>teams</b> <b>do</b> not sit next to each other because this disrupts the community. In a similar way, competition displays an indirect way of fighting. Society does not condone direct fighting as a way of getting something so this is the most passive aggressive way of fighting. Because this is an acceptable practice, there are many supporters of competition as they fuel a way for the people to participate in a rivalry without the consequences of fighting. However, when the competition is not enough in sports and the tensions are high fighting does ensue.|$|E
