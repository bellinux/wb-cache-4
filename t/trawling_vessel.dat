40|$|The {{reaction}} of herring during pelagic trawl sampling {{has been studied}} by use of a high-frequency scanning sonar mounted on the headline of the trawl. The difficulties of obtaining high catch rates on shallow herring layers by single-vessel trawling are demonstrated.

40|$|Fish {{reaction}} to the whole trawling operation was studied using a stationary echo sounder-system observing the fish {{in front of the}} vessel and during trawl passage. Strong avoidance reactions were observed on haddock, with both horizontal and vertical movements of the fish.

40|$|Pelagic pair {{trawling}} for tuna, Thunnus spp., and swordfish, Xiphias gladius, {{was introduced in}} U. S. Northwest Atlantic waters in 1991. During autumn (October-November) of 1992 under the authority oft he Federal Atlantic Swordfish Regulations, the National Marine Fisheries Service placed observers aboard pelagic pair <b>trawl</b> <b>vessels</b> to document the catch, bycatch, discard, and gear used in this new fishery. The fishery is conducted primarily at night along shelf-edge waters from June to November. In late 1991, revised regulations restricted swordfish to bycatch in this fishery resulting in pelagic pair <b>trawl</b> <b>vessels</b> targeting tuna throughout 1992. Analyses of 1992 data indicate that albacore, T. alalunga, was the predominant species caught, although yellowfin tuna, T. albaeares, and bigeye tuna, T. obesus, were the preferred target species. Bycatch also included swordfish, large sharks, pelagic rays and other pelagic fishes, other tunas, and marine mammals...|$|R

In this paper these measured velocities are fitted to a deterministic mean behaviour model and a diffusion-advection model taking the random component into account. The output of the diffusion-advection model is used to estimate {{the probability of a}} fish to be caught by the bottom trawl. For typical depths in the Barents Sea, 200 - 350 m, and for immature Cod feeding on capelin, a mean fishing height of about 10 metres is found, and the effect of horizontal herding from the warp is shown.

40|$|Thorough {{knowledge}} {{of the dynamics of}} natural fish behaviour and distribution within a survey and among surveys is fundamental for reliability of time series of abundance indices. Further, vessel/trawl affected avoidance may greatly affect density estimates from trawl and acoustic surveys. Means for monitoring behaviour of fish during surveys or in special experiments have been limited, time consuming and expensive. This paper describes an acoustic buoy system for monitoring undisturbed distribution and behaviour of fish as well as avoidance reactions of fish in relation to passing surveying or <b>trawling</b> <b>vessel.</b> Operation and results from the first trials are described. The buoy could easily be operated in connection with a standard trawl haul, prolonging the haul time with approximately 30 minutes for launching, retrieval and extra cruising distance. Information on fish distribution and behaviour, i. e. vertical and horizontal movements, is stored in the buoy and can easily be downloaded for later processing and analysis. Observations on cod demonstrated avoidance away from the vessel of variable intensity...|$|E

40|$|Ecosystem-scale {{networks}} of marine protected areas (MPAs) are important conservation tools, but their effectiveness {{is difficult to}} quantify in a time frame appropriate to species conservation because of uncertainties in the data available. The dugong (Dugong dugon) is a mobile marine species that occurs in shallow inshore waters of an ecosystem-scale network of MPAs (the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area [GBRWHA]). We developed a rapid approach to assess risk to dugongs {{in the region and}} evaluate options to ameliorate that risk. We used expert opinion and a Delphi technique to identify and rank 5 human factors with the potential to adversely affect dugongs and their sea grass habitats: netting, indigenous hunting, <b>trawling,</b> <b>vessel</b> traffic, and poor-quality terrestrial runoff. We then quantified and compared the distribution of these factors with a spatially explicit model of dugong distribution. We estimated that approximately 96 % of habitat of high conservation value for dugongs in the GBRWHA is at low risk from human activities. Using a sensitivity analysis, we found that to decrease risk, commercial netting or indigenous hunting had to be reduced in remote areas and the effects of vessel traffic, terrestrial runoff, and commercial netting had to be reduced in urban areas. This approach enabled us to compare and rank risks so as to identify the most severe risks and locate specific sites that require further management attention. 10 page(s...|$|E

Gillnets are made from lightweight monofilament that is difficult for dolphins to detect, especially when they are distracted (e.g. chasing fish) or moving around without using echolocation. Hector's and Maui's dolphins swim into the nets, get caught, and drown - or more accurately, suffocate (breathing is active in dolphins). Hector's dolphins are actively attracted to <b>trawling</b> <b>vessels</b> and can frequently be seen following trawlers and diving down to the net.
