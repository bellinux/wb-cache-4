Zhukov was then slammed to the mat back-first and headbutted from the top rope, which allowed The Barbarian to pin him.|$|E

60|$|This way of talking, nevertheless, has prevailed, and, as I guess, {{produced}} great confusion. For {{these being}} all different <b>powers</b> in <b>the</b> mind, {{or in the}} man, to do several actions, he exerts them as he thinks fit: but <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to do one action is not operated on by <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> doing another action. For <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> thinking operates not on <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> choosing, nor <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> choosing on <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> thinking; no more than <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> dancing operates on <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> singing, or <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> singing on <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> dancing, as any one who reflects on it will easily perceive.

5|$|One {{check on}} a magistrate's power was his collegiality. Each magisterial office {{would be held}} {{concurrently}} by at least two people. Another such check was provocatio. Provocatio was a primordial form of due process. It was a precursor to habeas corpus. If any magistrate tried to use <b>the</b> <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> the state against a citizen, that citizen could appeal {{the decision of the}} magistrate to a tribune. In addition, once a magistrate's one-year term of office expired, he would have to wait ten years before serving in that office again. This created problems for some consuls and praetors, and these magistrates would occasionally have their imperium extended. In effect, they would retain <b>the</b> <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> the office (as a promagistrate), without officially holding that office.|$|E

5|$|Earlier than Stifel, the 8th century Jain {{mathematician}} Virasena {{is credited}} with a precursor to the binary logarithm.
