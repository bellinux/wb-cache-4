2500|$|After his songwriting {{contributions}} {{were rejected}} from the band's previous album, 1986's Somewhere in Time, Dickinson felt that his role within the band had diminished, as he [...] "just became the singer," [...] but felt renewed enthusiasm when Harris explained the concept to him; [...] "I thought, 'What a great idea! Brilliant!' And of course I was really chuffed, too, because he'd actually rung {{me to talk}} about it and ask me if I had any songs that might fit that sort of theme. I was like, 'Well, no, but give me a minute and I'll see what I can do.'" [...] Speaking about the record in later years, however, Dickinson remarked that [...] "we almost did [...] ", explaining that, [...] "it was only half a concept album. There was no attempt <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the way through, like we really should have done. Seventh Son... has no story. It's about good and evil, heaven and hell, but isn't every Iron Maiden record?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mark Twain {{arrived in}} Chicago in good season <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> Three [...] letters to Mrs. Clemens intimately present his experiences: his [...] {{enthusiastic}} enjoyment {{and his own}} personal triumph.|$|E
60|$|I {{wish you}} could have been there <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> hear it all, and feel it: and get {{yourself}} blown away with the hurricane huzza that swept the place as a finish.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah! {{that comes}} of giving one's {{undivided}} thoughts to a matter. I have been {{turning it over}} in my mind till I have been able <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> It was odd, wasn't it, that I should have foretold to you all that happened, almost to the volume?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{comes of}} imagination," [...] he said. [...] "When {{you see a}} thing, you've got <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> around, or what's the good of seeing it at all? I saw the beach, so I left a couple of constables behind {{to keep an eye}} on it. That's all." ...|$|E
60|$|Lowiny did {{not answer}} me for near a minute, and I began to fear that I had put another indiscreet question. The girl seemed thoughtful, but when she raised her face so high as to allow me <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> <b>all</b> the {{expression}} of the more generous feminine sympathy was visible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Clap a stopper on yer noise, will 'ee?" [...] cried Disco sternly, [...] "else you'll be bringin' all {{the wild}} beasts {{in these parts}} down on us <b>to</b> <b>see</b> wot <b>it's</b> <b>all</b> about." ...|$|R
50|$|The doorjambs of Emar mutt are {{noteworthy}} <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> <b>It</b> has <b>all</b> {{features of}} Kalingan architecture. The mutt was renovated during Maratha ruling on Orissa. The followers of this mutt belong to Thengalai sect of Srivaishnava sampradaya.|$|R
6000|$|... "O Marian!" [...] began Agnes, [...] "so {{you have}} not quite lost your old self! I am glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how <b>it</b> <b>all</b> is at least, for I have {{something}} tangible to pity you for." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lovely, ain't it! An' I've got <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> day long. I can't {{look out}} the winder but that thing's right in my face." [...] It seemed to make her savage. She hadn't been in such a temper since her visit to New York. [...] "I hope you feel {{satisfied}} with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's Tom, wanting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> {{before he}} sleeps!" [...] cried Sam Rover with a grin. [...] "You look out, Tom, that you don't get into disgrace the first thing, {{as you did}} {{when we went to}} Putnam Hall Don't you {{remember}} that giant firecracker, and how Josiah Crabtree locked you up in a cell for setting it off?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you know}} I wouldn't pay a {{dividend}} {{with the first}} hundred, because I wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in a lump,--and when I see it, I'm sure on't. If you trust to luck, it's sure to be against me. It's Old Harry's got the luck in his hands; and if I lose one year, I shall never pick it up again; death 'ull o'ertake me." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Quickenham arrived {{an hour or}} {{two before}} dinner, and was {{immediately}} taken out <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the obnoxious building; while Mrs. Fenwick, who never would go <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> described <b>all</b> its horrors to her sister within the guarded precincts of her own drawing-room.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you mean}} about Miss Van Siever and yourself, I was quite in earnest, Conway. I {{do not think}} you could do better, and I should be glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> of <b>all</b> things. Nothing would please me more than to bring Miss Van Siever and you together." ...|$|R

60|$|The second {{incident}} was at Bristol, where I {{lost sight of}} my gentleman some hours. From this eclipse he returned to me with thick speech, wandering footsteps, and a back all whitened with plaster. I had half expected, yet I could have wept <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> disabilities were piled on that weak back--domestic misfortune, nervous disease, a displeasing exterior, empty pockets, and the slavery of vice.|$|E
6000|$|... "He wants a {{novel to}} be simply and {{completely}} done. He {{wants it to}} have a unity, he demands homogeneity.... Why should a book have that? For a picture it's reasonable, because you have <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> at once. But there's no {{need to see a}} book all at once. It's like wanting to have a whole county done in one style and period of architecture. It's like insisting that a walking tour must stick to one valley....|$|E
60|$|LORD W. [Shaking hands] How d'you do! Delighted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you <b>all.</b> <b>It's</b> {{awfully good}} of you to have come.|$|R

60|$|Lean and lank Southerners, {{with the}} {{imperial}} cut on their pale, brown whiskers, alternated with stalwart, slouch-hatted Westerners. Clean-shaven, pale clerks hurried to and fro; groups of sightseers infested every nook, and wore {{the look of}} those determined <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> They were accompanied often by one whose certainty of accent gave evidence of his fitness to be their guide. The {{sound of his voice}} proclaimed his judgments as he pushed his dazed wordless victims about.|$|E
60|$|Lord Dawlish {{had found}} New York enjoyable, but a trifle fatiguing. There was {{much to be}} seen in the city, and he had made the mistake of trying <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> at once. It had been his intention, when he came home after dinner that night, to try to restore the balance of things by going to bed early. He had sat up longer than he had intended, because he had been {{thinking}} about this letter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{understand}} that," [...] said Lemuel. [...] "I couldn't help it, at first. But I've got <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in {{a different}} light since then. I know that you meant the best by me. I know now that what I wrote wasn't worth anything, and just how you must have looked at it. I didn't know some things then that I do now; and since I have got to know a little more I have understood better what you meant by all you said." ...|$|E
50|$|One {{does not}} have to pay to look at the bridge, but there is a fee to cross it! This can change, but usually amounts to 400 taka (just under US$5) for a car to cross. Another {{experience}} can be to hire a local boat or fisherman to take you underneath the bridge, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> in <b>all</b> its concrete glory.|$|R

"They {{would not}} let me go," [...] went on Margaret; [...] "they forced me <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> The pair tarried for a while beneath some trees by the bath and were hidden there.

So it went on until the {{darkness}} fell, and we went, leaving them there. Now," [...] she added, with a little sob, [...] "what say you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{road was}} hard and smooth, and the {{spirited}} little team bowled the heavy wagon along at a swift pace. [...] "We're late," [...] Crandall said, as he snapped his long whip {{over the heads of}} his horses, [...] "and we've got to make it in twenty-five minutes or miss part of the show." [...] This caused Johnny great anxiety. He had never seen a play and wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> He looked at the flying legs of the horses and pushed on the dashboard, chirping at them slyly.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is just this," [...] Brooks said, {{in a low}} tone, [...] "just {{the thought}} of these people makes me afraid, {{positively}} afraid to argue with Henslow. You see--he may be right. I {{tell you that in}} a healthily-governed country there should be work for every man who is able and willing to work. And in England there isn't. Free Trade works out all right logically, but it's one thing <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> on paper, and it's another to see this--here around us--and Medchester isn't the worst off by any means." ...|$|E
