40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the impact of the length of <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> lag under <b>the</b> early disclosure system in Japan. First, we measure the length of <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> lag. Second, we investigate whether reducing <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> lag significantly increases patent applications. We use data from 1985 to 2000 on 101 Japanese companies. The parameter for <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> lag was significantly negative in all equations. Therefore, reducing <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> lag increases patent applications. We also empirically investigated the determination of R. <b>The</b> <b>grant</b> lag significantly affects R, Grant Lag, Patent Policy, R...|$|R

5|$|Within the Macedonian commonwealth, or the Koinon of Macedonians, {{there is}} some epigraphic {{evidence}} from the 3rd century BC that foreign relations were handled by the central government. Although Macedonian cities nominally participated in panhellenic events on their own accord, in reality <b>the</b> <b>granting</b> of asylia (inviolability, diplomatic immunity, {{and the right of}} asylum at sanctuaries) to certain cities (e.g. Kyzikos in Anatolia) was handled directly by the king or a preexisting regulation. Likewise, the city-states within contemporary Greek koina (i.e., federations of city-states, the sympoliteia) obeyed the federal decrees voted on collectively by the members of their league. In city-states belonging to a league or commonwealth, <b>the</b> <b>granting</b> of proxenia (i.e. the hosting of foreign ambassadors) was usually a right shared by local and central authorities. While there is plenty of surviving evidence that <b>the</b> <b>granting</b> of proxenia was the sole prerogative of central authorities in the neighboring Epirote League, a small amount of evidence suggests the same arrangement in the Macedonian commonwealth. However, city-states that were allied with the Kingdom of Macedonia and existed outside of Macedonia proper issued their own decrees regarding proxenia. Foreign leagues also formed alliances with the Macedonian kings, such as when the Cretan League signed treaties with Demetrius II Aetolicus and Antigonus III Doson ensuring enlistment of Cretan mercenaries into the Macedonian army, and elected Philip V of Macedon as honorary protector (prostates) of the league.|$|E

40|$|Using a {{database}} of 605, 106 option grant filings by insiders between 1992 and 2002, we find significant abnormal stock return reversals around <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> date. Consistent with the hypothesis that managers influence their pay, the reversals are positively related to <b>grant</b> size and <b>the</b> seniority of the manager, and negatively related to the firm size. The reversals are also more pronounced for grants that are not awarded on a regular schedule. The returns following <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> date are negatively correlated to the returns prior to <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> date, indicating that some firms are attempting to influence <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> date stock price by more than just timing <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> date or timing information releases around <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> date. We find that the extent of reversals are positively related to {{the magnitude of the}} time interval between <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> date and <b>the</b> date <b>the</b> <b>grants</b> are reported to the SEC, suggesting that some firms are setting <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> date on a back-date basis, i. e., picking a date in the past with a lower stock price compared to that on the decision date...|$|R

5|$|Architectural {{historian}} Anthony Emery {{argues that}} the castle was built in three phases, starting with the central keep, which he believes {{was intended as a}} largely unfortified summer residence for the Abbot.

5|$|Bills {{for three}} {{similarly}} inspired new underground railways were also submitted to Parliament for the 1892 parliamentary session, and, {{to ensure a}} consistent approach, a Joint Select Committee was established to review the proposals.

After rejecting the construction of stations on land owned by the Crown Estate and the Duke of Portland between Oxford Circus and Baker Street, the Committee allowed the BS bill to proceed for normal parliamentary consideration.|$|E

40|$|The (Master's) Thesis {{deals with}} the process of {{awarding}} <b>the</b> <b>grants</b> to <b>the</b> municipalities. The main emphasis of the Thesis is put on the following questions: who (political representatives in particular committees, councils and local authorities, or clerks), under which standards and in what way decides about the funds distribution. The research will be made in chosen municipalities. There will be given certain standards that will serve as a base for the research analysis of the transparency of the process of awarding <b>the</b> <b>grants.</b> In <b>the</b> primary phase, the data will be collected by the means of standardized interview of particular municipal employees concerned with <b>grant</b> policy. <b>The</b> secondary phase of the research will be based on desk research method.

The attempts of Otto to conciliate Greek sentiment through efforts to enlarge the frontiers of his kingdom, for example, by the suggested acquisition of Crete in 1841, failed in their objective, and only succeeded in embroiling him in conflict with the Great Powers.|$|E

40|$|This {{empirical}} study {{takes advantage}} of a new intergovernmental grant in order to investigate the expenditure behavior of the municipalities in Sweden in two ways. First, <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> is used to study the effect on municipal spending related to <b>the</b> <b>grant.</b> Second, <b>the</b> <b>grant</b> is used to test a hypothesis of spatial interaction among municipalities due to mimicking behavior. <b>The</b> <b>grant</b> and expenditures studied here pertain to one specific service area of the Swedish municipalities; services to functionally impaired individuals. <b>The</b> <b>grant</b> was introduced in 2004. The data used pertains to the period before (2001 - 2003) and after (2004 - 2007) the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>grant.</b> A fixed-effects spatial lag model is used to study the (possible) spatial interactions among municipalities. Interestingly, {{the results show that}} during the first time period, the municipalities interact with their neighbors when setting the expenditure level, possibly due to mimicking. In the second time period, after the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>grant,</b> {{there is no evidence of}} interaction.
