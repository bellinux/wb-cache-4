25|$|The two, at {{the extreme}} of their rivalry, {{climbing}} the road wrapped like a ribbon round the majestic volcano, terribly steep, in parallel action... I've always been convinced that in these moments that supreme player of poker, the Norman , used his craftiness and his fearless bluffing to win his fifth Tour. Because, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> clear that Anquetil was at the very limit of his strength and that had Poulidor attacked him repeatedly and suddenly {{then he would have}} cracked... Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly too big a gear, which stopped his jumping away, I still think that it was in his head that Pou-Pou should have changed gears.|$|E

500|$|On February 20, {{the colonists}} {{set foot on}} land {{for the first time}} in three months since leaving Santo Domingo. They set up a {{temporary}} camp near the site of the present-day Matagorda Island Lighthouse. The chronicler of the expedition, Henri Joutel, described his first view of Texas: [...] "The country did not seem very favorable <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> flat and sandy but did nevertheless produce grass. There were several salt pools. We hardly saw any wild fowl except some cranes and Canadian geese which were not expecting us." ...|$|E

500|$|Officially it {{was called}} a [...] "planned withdrawal" [...] (...). But <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so much bullshit. The next day, we heard on the radio, in the 'news from the front' (Wehrmachtbericht) about the [...] "successful front correction" [...] in our Yelnya {{defensive}} lines and the enormous losses we inflicted on the enemy. But no single word was heard about a retreat, about the hopelessness of the situation, about the mental and emotional numbness of the German soldiers. In short, it was again a [...] "victory". But we {{on the front line}} were running back like rabbits in front of the fox. This metamorphosis of the truth from [...] "all shit" [...] to [...] "it was a victory" [...] baffled me, and those of my comrades who dared to think.|$|E
500|$|During the film's fire scene, Cody {{appears as}} a {{character}} in the barroom. [...] "To me, I am afraid of fire and fire technics {{and all that stuff}} which is why I don't know why I asked to be in the bar scene because I've never exploded before", she said. She had asked to be set on fire. [...] "That was me trying to conquer a fear. By the way, they would not allow me to do a full burn for insurance purposes, even though I argued that Burt Reynolds had done it once", stated Cody. [...] "But apparently he got really hurt, so they would not let me. To me, there's nothing more horrifying than being stuck in a claustrophobic space as it is burning down so, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> more like tapping into a personal fear. That's not tough." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Hand in Glove" [...] was {{released}} as the Smiths' debut recording in May 1983. The single sold consistently {{for the next}} 18 months. Although the single failed to reach the UK Singles Chart, it reached number three on the UK Indie Chart. Its relative success earned the group a listing in the Guinness Book of Records in January 1984 when it and the group's next two singles' [...] "This Charming Man" [...] and [...] "What Difference Does It Make?"' held the top three position on the UK Indie Chart. [...] "It {{should have been a}} massive hit", Morrissey later said, [...] "it was so urgent. <b>To</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a complete cry in every direction. It really was a landmark." [...] The single did raise the band's profile; a week after its release the band gained its first major live reviews in the music press, which in turn led to their first radio session with BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel.|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "Cyprus Avenue" [...] is a three chord blues {{composition}} and served {{for many years}} as the closing song for most of Morrison's live shows. [...] Along with [...] "Madame George", it {{is the centerpiece of}} the album and both songs are Belfast related and highly impressionistic. [...] The song is told {{from the point of view}} of an outsider watching from inside an automobile and getting tongue-tied as the refined school girl he fantasizes about appears and he imagines her a fine lady with [...] "rainbow ribbons in her hair" [...] in a carriage drawn by six white horses and [...] "returning from a fair". Van Morrison described Cyprus Avenue as [...] "a street in Belfast, [...] a place where there's a lot of wealth. [...] It wasn't far from where I was brought up and it was a very [...] different scene. [...] <b>To</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a very mystical place. [...] It was a whole avenue lined with trees and I found it a place where I could think." ...|$|E
500|$|On 27 December, French sources {{revealed}} that Manchester United {{was interested in}} signing Evra. Despite rumours of Monaco reaching a transfer agreement with Internazionale, on 3 January 2006, Evra revealed he preferred to move to England to join Manchester United. The following day, Manchester United officially issued a transfer bid for the player. On 6 January, United manager Sir Alex Ferguson confirmed a deal for Evra was reached. Four days later, the transfer was official as Evra joined the club for a transfer fee of around £5.5million and signed a three-and-a-half-year contract. Evra's arrival signalled Ferguson's intention {{to shore up the}} club's defence that had suffered since the sidelining of Gabriel Heinze. After joining the club, Evra affirmed that Manchester was his only future destination: [...] "I was not very keen to go forward in the talks with Arsenal, Liverpool or Real Madrid. They all talked with my agent in the past two seasons. But <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> over. As I said to the Monaco officials, I only wanted to hear about Manchester." ...|$|E
500|$|Shilts {{decided to}} write And the Band Played On after {{attending}} an awards ceremony in 1983 where he was to receive a commendation for his coverage on AIDS. As described in the book, television announcer Bill Kurtis gave the keynote address and told a joke: [...] "What's the hardest part about having AIDS? Trying to convince your wife that you're Haitian." [...] Shilts responded to the joke by saying that it [...] "says everything about how the media had dealt with AIDS. Bill Kurtis felt that he could go {{in front of a}} journalists' group in San Francisco and make AIDS jokes. First of all, he could assume that nobody there would be gay and, if they were gay, they wouldn't talk about it and that nobody would take offense at that. To me, that summed up the whole problem of dealing with AIDS in the media. Obviously, the reason I covered AIDS from the start was that, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> never something that happened to those other people." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Mercury had a {{long-term}} relationship with Mary Austin, whom he met through guitarist Brian May. He lived with Austin for several years in West Kensington, London. By the mid-1970s, the singer had begun {{an affair with a}} male American record executive at Elektra Records and, in December 1976, Mercury told Austin of his sexuality, which ended their romantic relationship. Mercury moved out of the flat they shared, into 12 Stafford Terrace in Kensington and bought Austin a place of her own nearby. They remained close friends through the years, with Mercury often referring to her as his only true friend. In a 1985 interview, Mercury said of Austin, [...] "All my lovers asked me why they couldn't replace Mary , but it's simply impossible. The only friend I've got is Mary and I don't want anybody else. To me, she was my common-law wife. <b>To</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a marriage. We believe in each other, that's enough for me." [...] He also wrote several songs about Austin, the most notable of which is [...] "Love of My Life". Mercury's final home, Garden Lodge, 1 Logan Place, a twenty-eight room Georgian mansion in Kensington set in a quarter-acre manicured garden surrounded by a high brick wall, had been picked out by Austin. In his will, Mercury left his London home to Austin, rather than his partner Jim Hutton, saying to her, [...] "You would have been my wife {{and it would have been}} yours anyway." [...] Mercury was also the godfather of Austin's oldest son, Richard.|$|E
500|$|During one scene, a {{frustrated}} Tom Cruise angrily {{jumps up and}} down on a couch while Oprah Winfrey sits next to him. This is a reference to an incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005, in which Cruise repeatedly jumped on the couch next to Oprah, fell to one knee and loudly professed his love for actress Katie Holmes. Cruise has been repeatedly mocked for his behavior. In another scene, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are shown to have actor Harrison Ford leashed, chained and ball-gagged, as the actor wears the fedora he wore in the Indiana Jones films. This is a reference to the twelfth season episode [...] "The China Probrem", in which Lucas and Spielberg literally rape Indiana Jones repeatedly, which served as a commentary by Parker and Stone for the poor quality of the 2008 Spielberg/Lucas film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. A cartoon image of film director Tim Burton is featured in the episode, despite having not been previously ridiculed by the show. In the episode, Burton is mocked for not having an original idea since the 1988 comedy horror film Beetlejuice, and for his tendency to feature film actor Johnny Depp in so many of his films that he should [...] "just have sex with him [...] already". Cartman's Jennifer Lopez hand-puppet repeatedly demands food from the American restaurant chain Taco Bell, particularly enchiritos, {{which is one of the}} many Hispanic stereotypes utilized by the character. [...] Also, when the celebrities are discussing who to bring in to help capture Mohammed, Barbra Streisand is referenced as [...] "her," [...] to which the discussion goes [...] "her who?" [...] "her" [...] "oh...her." [...] This is slightly reminiscent of the movie Little Shop of Horrors when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin are talking about Audrey, who the dentist had physically abused, where Steve asks [...] "what did I ever do to you" [...] and Rick answers [...] "it wasn't what you did <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> what you did to her" [...] Steve: [...] "her? oh...her" ...|$|E
500|$|Entering the 2005–06 season, Horton {{stated in}} {{response}} to a question about his shoulders, [...] "I feel better. I feel stronger, bigger." [...] In the season opener against the Atlanta Thrashers, Horton scored the first goal for the Panthers. Through the first games of the season, Horton was tied for the team lead in goals. On November 8, 2005, Horton was placed on injured reserve because of a knee injury. He was activated on December 1 and scored in his first game back against the Washington Capitals to help the Panthers win 32. Horton added 2 goals against the Chicago Blackhawks in the Panthers' next game to bring his season total to 10 in 17 games. Against the Nashville Predators on December 13, Horton recorded his first career hat trick and stated after the game that, [...] "It's a pretty nice feeling. I felt like there was no one on me. I just tried to get it to the net and it went in every time." [...] Despite missing 10 games to injury, Horton was tied with teammate Olli Jokinen for the team lead in goals with 16 after 38 games. Against Washington on January 9, Horton and Joe Nieuwendyk scored a goal in the shootout to help the Panthers win 43. Two days after his shootout goal, Horton was promoted to the Panthers' first line. Despite his promotion to the first line, Horton's name was mentioned in a potential trade with the Vancouver Canucks; however, nothing materialized. [...] In a 62 win over the Ottawa Senators, Horton scored 2 goals including one on a rebound, after which he said, [...] "It just popped right out <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> a long time coming for goals for me. I got lucky tonight and hopefully they keep going in." [...] In March, Horton began playing in penalty kill situations for the first time in his career. Also against the Lightning, Horton scored the Panthers' only goal with his 27th goal of the season. Horton completed the season playing 71 games, scoring 28 goals and adding 19 assists.|$|E

2500|$|Furman {{has said}} he felt Death's Head II [...] "lost his [...] most {{important}} aspect; the dark-edged gallows humour.

But Julia was actually flattered: [...] "I thought, really, {{that was one of the}} nicest things anyone ever said <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> hard to go out with other guys after that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Santana {{moved to}} San Francisco and, in October 1966, started the Santana Blues Band.
