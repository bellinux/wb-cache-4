There are numerous anatropous (curved) ovules which display axile placentation (parietal in Scoliopus and Medeola), usually with an integument and thinner megasporangium. The embryo sac (megagametophyte) varies by genera, but is mainly tetrasporic (e.g. Fritillaria).

50|$|One sperm fertilizes the {{egg cell}} {{and the other}} sperm {{combines}} with the two polar nuclei of the large central cell of the megagametophyte. The haploid sperm and haploid egg combine to form a diploid zygote, while the other sperm and the two haploid polar nuclei of the large central cell of the megagametophyte form a <b>triploid</b> <b>nucleus</b> (triple fusion). Some plants may form polyploid nuclei. The large cell of the gametophyte will then develop into the endosperm, a nutrient-rich tissue which provides nourishment to the developing embryo. The ovary, surrounding the ovules, develops into the fruit, which protects the seeds and may function to disperse them.|$|E

40|$|The haploid {{chromosome}} number in Tamarix ericoides Rottl., {{reported for the}} first time, is twelve. The archesporial cell is single, rarely double. There is no tetrad formation, division of the megaspore mother-cell; instead, a four nucleate embryo-sac results. The nuclei are originally arranged in a cruciform type, but later form a I+ 3 arrangement. As {{a result of the}} third division, the embryo-sac is again four-nucleate, with two haploid nuclei at the micropylar end and two <b>triploid</b> <b>nuclei</b> at the chalazal end. The cells of the embryo-sac are formed {{at the end of the}} fourth division, the embryo-sac thus representing the sixteen nucleate condition. The development of the embryo-sac of Tamarix ericoides conforms to the Fritillaria-type. The endosperm is free nuclear, and the embryo is characteristic in developing a massive suspensor and a large pad of cellular tissue from the proximal cell. Double embryo-sacs and the occurrence of polyembryony are reported for the first time in the family...|$|R
40|$|The {{endosperm}} is at {{the center}} of successful seed formation in flowering plants. Being itself a product of fertilization, it is devoted to nourish the developing embryo and typically possesses a triploid genome consisting of two maternal and one paternal genome complement. Interestingly, endosperm development is controlled by epigenetic mechanisms conferring parent-of-origin-dependent effects that influence seed development. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we have previously described an endosperm-specific heterochromatin fraction, which increases with higher maternal, but not paternal, genome dosage. Here, we report a detailed analysis of chromosomal arrangement and association frequency in endosperm nuclei. We found that centromeric FISH signals in isolated nuclei show a planar alignment that may results from a semi-rigid, connective structure between chromosomes. Importantly, we found frequent pairwise association of centromeres, chromosomal segments, and entire arms of chromosomes in 3 C endosperm nuclei. These associations deviate from random expectations predicted by numerical simulations. Therefore, we suggest a non-random chromosomal organization in the <b>triploid</b> <b>nuclei</b> of Arabidopsis endosperm. This contrasts with the prevailing random arrangement of chromosome territories in somatic nuclei. Based on observations on a series of nuclei with varying parental genome ratios, we propose a model where chromosomes associate pairwise involving one maternal and one paternal complement. The functional implications of this predicted chromosomal arrangement are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{nucellus}} (plural: nucelli) {{is part of}} {{the inner}} structure of the ovule, forming a layer of diploid (sporophytic) cells immediately inside the integuments. It is structurally and functionally equivalent to the megasporangium. In immature ovules, the nucellus contains a megasporocyte (megaspore mother cell), which undergoes sporogenesis via meiosis. In gymnosperms, three of the four haploid spores produced in meiosis typically degenerate, leaving one surviving megaspore inside the nucellus. Among angiosperms, however, a wide range of variation exists in what happens next. The number (and position) of surviving megaspores, the total number of cell divisions, whether nuclear fusions occur, and the final number, position and ploidy of the cells or nuclei all vary. A common pattern of embryo sac development (the Polygonum type maturation pattern) includes a single functional megaspore followed by three rounds of mitosis. In some cases, however, two megaspores survive (for example, in Allium and Endymion). In some cases all four megaspores survive, for example in the Fritillaria type of development (illustrated by Lilium in the figure) there is no separation of the megaspores following meiosis, then the nuclei fuse to form a <b>triploid</b> <b>nucleus</b> and a haploid nucleus. The subsequent arrangement of cells is similar to the Polygonum pattern, but the ploidy of the nuclei is different.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} the potential value of interphase cytogenetic and argyrophilic nucleolar organiser region (AgNOR) analyses {{in the diagnosis}} and classification of hydatidiform moles. METHODS: Serial tissue sections from 37 hydatidiform moles, histologically classified as 11 complete and 15 partial, and from 11 hydropic abortuses were examined by in situ hybridisation using digoxigenin labelled probes specific for chromosomes 1, X, and Y, and a one step silver staining method. The percentages of diploid and <b>triploid</b> <b>nuclei,</b> and {{the mean number of}} AgNORs for each tissue were determined. RESULTS: Interphase cytogenetics showed that eight of the 11 cases (73 %) each of complete mole and hydropic abortus had diploid pattern and the three remaining cases (27 %) of each group were triploid. Two of the triploid complete moles and one of the triploid hydropic abortuses were revised to partial moles and one remaining triploid complete mole was revised to hydropic abortus. Of the 15 partial moles, nine (60 %) were triploid, and six (40 %) were diploid. These diploid cases were revised to three complete moles and three hydropic abortuses. There was a significant difference (p or = 5. The results of analyses by the two methods were closely correlated. CONCLUSIONS: Interphasecytogeneticanalysis using chromosome specific probes and AgNOR count provides a valuable approach for ploidy analysis in histological sections of hydatidiform moles and helps to resolve difficult cases...|$|R
40|$|Diploid frog nuclei from {{differentiated}} somatic cells, transplanted into enucleated eggs {{to determine}} whether cell specialization generally involves irreversible genetic changes, have shown that nuclei from specialized somatic cells still contain the genes specifying the cell types and organ systems of swimming tadpoles. However, those tadpoles failed to feed and did not survive beyond the initial tadpole stages. Here we report that, after incubation in oocytes, <b>triploid</b> erythrocyte <b>nuclei</b> from juvenile frogs of Rana pipiens directed the formation of feeding tadpoles that survived up to a month and had differentiated hind limb buds. These tadpoles occurred at a high yield and showed the most extensive development so far obtained from documented differentiated somatic nuclei...|$|R
50|$|Fertilisation or {{fertilization}} (see spelling differences), {{also known}} as generative fertilisation, conception, fecundation, syngamy and impregnation, is the fusion of gametes to initiate {{the development of a}} new individual organism. The cycle of fertilisation and development of new individuals is called sexual reproduction. During double fertilisation in angiosperms the haploid male gamete combines with two haploid polar nuclei to form a <b>triploid</b> primary endosperm <b>nucleus</b> by the process of vegetative fertilisation.|$|R
