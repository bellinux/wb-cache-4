5|$|As cancers do not {{immediately}} emerge after {{exposure to radiation}} instead radiation-induced cancer has a minimum latency period of some 5+ years. An epidemiology study by the RERF estimates that from 1950 to 2000, 46% of leukemia deaths and 11% of solid cancers of unspecificed lethality, {{could be due to}} radiation from the bombs, with the statistical excess being 200 leukemia deaths and 1,700 solid cancers of undeclared lethality. Both of these statistics being derived from the observation of approximately half of the total survivors, strictly <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> part in the study.|$|E
5|$|In the report, Hamilton {{felt that}} the {{securities}} should be paid at full value to their legitimate owners, including <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> the financial risk of buying government bonds that most experts thought would never be redeemed. He argued that liberty and property security were inseparable {{and that the government}} should honor the contracts, as they formed the basis of public and private morality. To Hamilton, the proper handling of the government debt would also allow America to borrow at affordable interest rates and would also be a stimulant to the economy.|$|E
5|$|On 27 November 1095, Urban II called {{together}} the Council of Clermont in France. There, amid {{a crowd of}} thousands {{who had come to}} hear his words, he urged all present to take up arms under the banner of the Cross and launch a holy war to recover Jerusalem and the east from the 'infidel' Muslims. Indulgences were to be granted to all <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> part in the great enterprise. Many promised to carry out the Pope's command, and word of the Crusade soon spread across western Europe.|$|E

5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in late 2009 by the National Addiction Centre (UK) found 41.3% of readers of Mixmag had used mephedrone {{in the last}} month, making it the fourth-most popular drug amongst clubbers. Of those, two thirds snorted the drug and the average dosage per session was 0.9g; the length of sessions increased as the dosage increased. Users who snorted the drug reported using more per session than <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> it orally (0.97g compared to 0.74g) and also reported using it more often (five days per month compared to three days per month). An Irish study of people on a methadone treatment program for heroin addicts found 29 of 209 patients tested positive for mephedrone usage.|$|E
5|$|After taking 5/18 in an innings {{win over}} North Eastern Transvaal, Johnston was {{ineffective}} in the high-scoring drawn Fourth Test, taking 1/68. He took {{a total of}} 6/52 and scored 24 not out against Griqualand West, and finished the Test campaign with 3/22 in the Fifth Test in Port Elizabeth, taking all his wickets in the second innings as Australia completed an innings victory and took the series 4–0. It was a successful tour for Johnston, with 23 wickets at 17.04, taking the most wickets at the lowest average among the Australian pacemen among <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> more than three wickets. The entire first-class campaign was even more successful; Johnston took a total of 7/37 as the Australians ended their tour with an innings victory over a South African XI. Johnston ended the African summer with 53 wickets at 14.09.|$|E
5|$|Other sources include {{fortified}} food and dietary supplements in various forms. A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide, {{one of the}} most common supplements in the United States, and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body. This review cited studies that found lower plasma zinc concentrations in the subjects who consumed zinc oxide and zinc carbonate than in <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> zinc acetate and sulfate salts. For fortification, however, a 2003 review recommended cereals (containing zinc oxide) as a cheap, stable source that is as easily absorbed as the more expensive forms. A 2005 study found that various compounds of zinc, including oxide and sulfate, did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as fortificants to maize tortillas.|$|E

5|$|Participation in the Crusades {{was also}} {{seen as a}} form of pilgrimage, and indeed the same Latin word, peregrinatio, was {{sometimes}} applied to both activities. While English participation in the First Crusade between 1095 and 1099 was limited, England played a prominent part in the Second, Third and Fifth Crusades over the next two centuries, with many crusaders leaving for the Levant during the intervening years. The idea of undertaking a pilgrimage to Jerusalem was not new in England, however, as the idea of religiously justified warfare went back to Anglo-Saxon times. Many of <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> up the Cross to go on a Crusade never actually left, often because the individual lacked sufficient funds to undertake the journey. Raising funds to travel typically involved crusaders selling or mortgaging their lands and possessions, which affected their families and, at times, considerably affected the economy as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Training {{began in}} early October in Wales and was {{designed}} to be extremely arduous, not only to ensure that <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> part were at the peak of their physical and mental fitness, but also to eliminate any men unable to cope with the long marches and difficult terrain that would be encountered during the operation. When this portion of the training had been completed, the sappers were then transferred to the area around Fort William in Scotland, where they were familiarised with a hydroelectric plant similar in design to the one in Norway, and received training on {{the most efficient way to}} plant explosives in the Norsk Hydro plant to cause maximum damage.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{attempted}} {{to build up}} a base of political support for Matilda in both England and Normandy, demanding that his court take oaths first in 1127, and then again in 1128 and 1131, to recognise Matilda as his immediate successor and recognise her descendants as the rightful rulers after her. Stephen was amongst <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> this oath in 1127. Nonetheless, relations between Henry, Matilda, and Geoffrey became increasingly strained {{towards the end of the}} King's life. Matilda and Geoffrey suspected that they lacked genuine support in England, and proposed to Henry in 1135 that the King should hand over the royal castles in Normandy to Matilda whilst he was still alive and insist on the Norman nobility swearing immediate allegiance to her, thereby giving the couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death. Henry angrily declined to do so, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy somewhat earlier than intended. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels. In the middle of this confrontation, Henry unexpectedly fell ill and died near Lyons-la-Forêt.|$|E

5|$|The new senator {{took his}} seat when Congress convened in December 1857 (the term of his predecessor, James C. Jones, had expired in March). He came to Washington as usual without {{his wife and}} family; Eliza would visit Washington only once during Johnson's first time as senator, in 1860. Johnson {{immediately}} set about introducing the Homestead Bill in the Senate, but as most senators who supported it were Northern (many associated with the newly founded Republican Party), the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue. Southern senators felt that <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> advantage of {{the provisions of the}} Homestead Bill {{were more likely to be}} Northern non-slaveholders. The issue of slavery had been complicated by the Supreme Court's ruling earlier in the year in Dred Scott v. Sandford that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories. Johnson, a slaveholding senator from a Southern state, made a major speech in the Senate the following May in an attempt to convince his colleagues that the Homestead Bill and slavery were not incompatible. Nevertheless, Southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation, 30–22. In 1859, it failed on a procedural vote when Vice President Breckinridge broke a tie against the bill, and in 1860, a watered-down version passed both houses, only to be vetoed by Buchanan at the urging of Southerners. Johnson continued his opposition to spending, chairing a committee to control it.|$|E
