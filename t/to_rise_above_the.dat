5|$|Lōʻihi is {{following}} the pattern of development that is characteristic of all Hawaiʻian volcanoes. Geochemical evidence from Lōʻihi lavas indicates that Lōʻihi is in transition between the preshield and shield volcano stage, providing valuable clues to the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. In the preshield stage, Hawaiian volcanoes have steeper sides and {{a lower level of}} activity, producing an alkali basalt lava. Continued volcanism is expected to eventually create an island at Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi experiences frequent landslides; the growth of the volcano has destabilized its slopes, and extensive areas of debris inhabit the steep southeastern face. Similar deposits from other Hawaiian volcanoes indicate that landslide debris is an important product of the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. Lōʻihi is predicted <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> surface in 10,000 to 100,000 years.|$|E

25|$|The actual {{existence}} of far-reaching type-differences, of which I have described eight groups in , has {{enabled me to}} conceive the two controversial theories of neurosis as manifestations of a type-antagonism. This discovery brought with it the need <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> opposition {{and to create a}} theory which would do justice not merely to one or the other side, but to both equally (Jung, 1966: pars. 65-66).|$|E
25|$|Delfim Ferrerira (1888-1960) {{enlarged}} {{the estate}} he inherited and diversified his activities and investment, particularly in construction and dam operations so that, unlike {{the count of}} Vizela, he was able <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> constraints of a failing industry {{in a world of}} galloping change.

25|$|Although GOES-3 {{ceased to}} be used for weather {{operations}} in 1989, it spent over 20 years as a critical part of communications between the U.S. and Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station before being decommissioned in 2016. Geostationary satellites expend fuel to keep themselves stationary over the equator, and thus cannot normally ordinarily be seen from the poles. When that fuel is depleted, solar and lunar perturbations increase the satellite's inclination so that its ground track begins to describe an analemma (a figure-8 in the north-south direction). This usually ends the satellite's primary mission. However, when the inclination is high enough the satellite may begin <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> polar horizons at the extremes of the figure-8, as was the case for GOES-3. A nine-meter dish was constructed at the station, and communication with the satellite could be obtained for about five hours per day. Data rates were around 2.048 megabytes/second (bi-directional) under optimum conditions.|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1860s, it became {{apparent}} that new, larger canals needed to be built if more acreage was to be farmed. The first dam in the Jordan Narrows was constructed in 1872 and raised in 1880, sparking an outcry from residents living near Utah Lake who thought the dam was responsible for raising the level of the lake. After several years of dispute, a commission was established to determine an acceptable compromise for the elevation of Utah Lake. [...] The commission's 1885 decision stated that if the lake level were <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> established compromise level, the Jordan River could not be impeded by either dams or flood gates. [...] Additionally, the commission stated that after water pumps were installed at the source of the river, the pumps should all be working if the lake were <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> compromise level. [...] However, if the lake level fell below the compromise level, pumps could be turned off so that water could be held for storage in Utah Lake.|$|E

500|$|Sarah Churchwell sees The Great Gatsby as a [...] "cautionary {{tale of the}} decadent {{downside}} of the American dream." [...] The story deals with the limits and realities of America's myths of social and class mobility; and the inevitably hopeless lower class aspirations <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> station(s) of their birth. [...] The book in stark relief through the narrator, Nick Carraway, observes that: [...] "...a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at birth." [...] Using elements of irony and tragic ending, it also delves into themes of excesses of the rich, and recklessness of youth.|$|E
500|$|Certain {{bacteria}} in the mouth live off the remains of foods, especially sugars and starches. In the absence of oxygen they produce lactic acid, which dissolves the calcium and phosphorus in the enamel. This process, known as [...] "demineralisation", leads to tooth destruction. Saliva gradually neutralises the acids which cause the pH of the tooth surface <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> critical pH, typically considered to be 5.5. This causes 'remineralisation', {{the return of the}} dissolved minerals to the enamel. If there is sufficient time between the intake of foods then the impact is limited and the teeth can repair themselves. Saliva is unable to penetrate through plaque, however, to neutralize the acid produced by the bacteria.|$|E

500|$|The local Scottsdale {{architectural}} firm Allen+Philp accepted {{the task of}} renovation, and in researching the hotel's history, they found that in the 1950s, Varney had originally intended a tower of guest rooms <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> central lobby, a feature that was not built at the time. Allen+Philp designed a seven-story tower {{for the purpose of}} giving the new hotel owners a chance of greater financial viability.

[...] Interior designer Cole-Martinez carefully updated the decorations and furnishings with [...] "one foot firmly in the present with subtle salutes to the past".

500|$|Chatterjee's view of Larkin is {{grounded}} in {{a detailed analysis of}} his poetic style. He notes a development from Larkin's early works to his later ones, which sees his style change from [...] "verbal opulence through a recognition of the self-ironising and self-negating potentiality of language to a linguistic domain where the conventionally held conceptual incompatibles – which are traditional binary oppositions between absolutes and relatives, between abstracts and concretes, between fallings and risings and between singleness and multiplicity – are found to be the last stumbling-block for an artist aspiring <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> impasse of worldliness". This contrasts with an older view that Larkin's style barely changed {{over the course of his}} poetic career. Chatterjee identifies this view as being typified by Bernard Bergonzi's comment that [...] "Larkin's poetry did not ... develop between 1955 and 1974". For Chatterjee, Larkin's poetry responds strongly to changing [...] "economic, socio-political, literary and cultural factors".|$|E

500|$|In 1898, Knut Wicksell {{proposed}} a monetary theory centered on interest rates. His analysis used two rates: the market interest rate, {{determined by the}} banking system, and the real or [...] "natural" [...] interest rate, determined by the {{rate of return on}} capital. In Wicksell's theory, cumulative inflation will occur when technical innovation causes the natural rate to rise or when the banking system allows the market rate to fall. Cumulative deflation occurs under the opposite conditions causing the market rate <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> natural. Wicksell's theory did not produce a direct relationship between the quantity of money and price level. According to Wicksell, money would be created endogenously, without an increase in quantity of hard currency, as long as the natural exceeded the market interest rate [...] In these conditions, borrowers turn a profit and deposit cash into bank reserves, which expands money supply. This can lead to a cumulative process where inflation increases continuously without an expansion in the monetary base. Wicksell's work influenced Keynes and the Swedish economists of the Stockholm School.|$|E
500|$|The central {{character}} {{of the novel is}} James Bond. In The Man with the Golden Gun, he appears with a different personality from the previous stories and is robot-like, according to author of the [...] "continuation" [...] Bond novels, Raymond Benson. Benson also noted that Bond's character had not been developed any further than in the previous books. Academic Jeremy Black noted that when given two opportunities to kill Scaramanga in cold blood, he cannot bring himself to do it. The first time this happens, is when Bond sits in a car behind Scaramanga; the method of killing would be to shoot him {{in the back of the}} head and this is compared to the technique used by both the KGB and Nazis. According to Black, Bond has <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> actions and act more suitably for a British fictional hero. Once the mission is completed, Bond is offered the KCMG, but he refuses the honour and reflects on his own name, [...] "a quiet, dull, anonymous name", which had been Fleming's aim when he first named the character. Benson also points out that the touches of humour displayed by Bond in the previous novels disappeared and he appeared in the book as cold and emotionless.|$|E
500|$|Erika Ramirez of Billboard {{magazine}} {{noted that}} there were two highlights of the night, aside from the choreography and vocal prowess; the dynamic between Beyoncé and her fans and the video montages from her personal life. Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Beyoncé was in a [...] "fighting shape, breezing through four nights of wickedly aggressive modern R" [...] and added that the most [...] "attention-grabbing" [...] moments of the night were the covers of other artists that she performed during the concert. Chuck Darrow of the Philadelphia Media Network noted that [...] "Beyonce and her small army of supporting singers, dancers and musicians... conjured an impressive onslaught of sight, sound and motion." [...] He further noted that unlike Lady Gaga and Madonna who used [...] "sartorial extremism" [...] to call attention to themselves, [...] "It is testament to Beyonce's star-power that her stage incandescent presence never allowed the visual pyrotechnics behind her or the hyperkinetic dancers beside her <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> peripheral." [...] Praising the feminism showcased during the show, Tris McCall of The Star-Ledger wrote in his review that Beyoncé gave everything she had for the concert pulling them out as vigorously as she could. He further added [...] "The star gave Ovation Hall exactly what it wanted, and left the new theater smoking. The problem for Revel now: following it up." [...] In another review, he described the concert as [...] "spellbinding", wrote that everything onstage was perfectly choreographed, down to the [...] "goofy mid-song mugging" [...] that added so much character to her performances. He concluded that no other pop artist sounds [...] "quite as awake" [...] as Beyoncé does.|$|E

50|$|However, {{beginning}} in the 20th century the novel was frequently criticized for depicting Jim as a stereotype, and Tom as an aggressor.

Twain therefore resorted to minstrel show-style comedy to provide humor at Jim's expense, and ended up conforming to rather than challenging late-19th century racist stereotypes.|$|R
