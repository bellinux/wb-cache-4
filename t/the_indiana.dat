5|$|In 1897, {{an amateur}} American {{mathematician}} attempted to persuade <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> legislature to pass <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> Pi Bill, which described {{a method to}} square the circle and contained text that implied various incorrect values for , including 3.2. The bill is notorious {{as an attempt to}} establish a value of scientific constant by legislative fiat. The bill was passed by <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> House of Representatives, but rejected by the Senate, meaning it did not become a law.|$|E
5|$|By April 27, 1861, Indiana's {{first six}} regiments, {{all of which}} were {{organized}} at Indianapolis, were fully organized as <b>the</b> First Brigade, <b>Indiana</b> Volunteers, under <b>the</b> command of Brigadier General Thomas A.

5|$|In 1911, {{at the age}} of 16, Smith enlisted as {{a private}} in Company D of the 2nd Indiana Infantry of <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> National Guard. <b>The</b> <b>Indiana</b> National Guard was called out twice in 1913, for the Ohio River flood and during the Indianapolis {{streetcar}} strike. Smith was promoted to corporal and then sergeant. During the Pancho Villa Expedition he served on the staff of <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> National Guard.|$|E

There was {{little doubt that}} the majority of Indianapolis residents supported the Union. The city became a hub for Union troop organization and training. Pro-Union mobs would sometimes force individuals suspected of Confederate sympathies to take an oath of loyalty at the mayor's office. The most notable of these was J. J. Bingham, the editor of the Indianapolis Sentinel. A mob forced Bingham to take a loyalty oath after articles critical of his political views appeared in the Indianapolis Journal.|$|R
2500|$|The {{main battery}} {{consisted}} of 4 12-inch/35 caliber hydraulically powered guns–as {{opposed to the}} /40 caliber guns of <b>the</b> <b>Indianas.</b> <b>The</b> vessel had a larger margin of freeboard and a longer hull and forecastle, which resulted in greater stability. The increased deck height--made the guns less exposed to seawater, {{reducing the risk of}} malfunctions due to wet weather. By utilizing the Harvey process, Iowas armor was thinner but stronger than the nickel-steel armor used in <b>the</b> <b>Indianas.</b> Compared to British warships, Iowa had excellent speed–-but was [...] lighter.|$|R

5|$|The Governor of Indiana is {{the chief}} {{executive}} of the state of Indiana. The governor is elected to a four-year term, and responsible for overseeing the day-to-day management of the functions of many agencies of <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> state government.

The governor works out of <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> Statehouse and holds official functions at <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> Governor's Residence in the state capital of Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|Democrats won a {{majority}} in <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> House of Representatives in the 2006 and 2008 elections. This caused Indiana to have a divided government, with Democrats controlling <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> House of Representatives and the Republicans controlling the governor's office and <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> Senate. This also lead to a stalemate in the budget debate, which caused Mitch Daniels call a special session of <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> General Assembly. The state {{was faced with a}} $1 billion shortfall in revenue for the 2009–11 budget years. Daniels proposed a range of spending cuts and cost-saving measures in his budget proposal. The General Assembly approved some of his proposals, but relied heavily on the state's reserve funds to pay for the budget shortfall. Daniels signed the $27 billion two-year budget into law.|$|E

5|$|In 1809, {{after the}} {{separation}} of the western portion of <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> Territory to create the Illinois Territory, elections were held to select members of territorial legislature's upper and lower houses for the first time. (Previously, lower-house members were elected, but the territorial governor appointed members to the upper house.) Harrison found himself at odds with the legislature after the antislavery faction came to power and the eastern portion of <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> Territory grew to include a large, antislavery population. When <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> Territory's general assembly convened in 1810, its antislavery faction immediately repealed the indenturing laws enacted in 1803 and in 1805. After 1809 Harrison's political authority declined as <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> territorial legislature assumed more authority and the territory advanced toward statehood. By 1812 Harrison had moved away and resumed his military career.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{was elected}} to Phi Beta Kappa during his final year at college.

His great-uncle Woodson Marshall began to help him, but the younger Marshall soon moved to Columbia City, Indiana, to live with his parents. Marshall read law in the Columbia City law office of Walter Olds, a future member of <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> Supreme Court, {{for more than a year}} and was admitted to <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> bar on April 26, 1875.|$|E

5|$|The Court has no {{original}} {{jurisdiction in}} most cases, {{meaning that it}} can only hear cases appealed to the Court after having been previously heard in lower courts. Most cases begin in local circuit courts, where the initial trial is held and a jury decides {{the outcome of the}} case. The circuit court decision can be appealed to <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> Court of Appeals or <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> Tax Court, who can hear the case or enforce the lower court's decision. If the parties still disagree with the outcome of the case, they can appeal the decision to <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> Supreme Court. The Court can choose to hear the case and possibly overturn the previous judgment, or it can decline to accept the case and uphold the decision of the lower courts.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Indiana</b> National Guard was federalized during WWI; many {{units were}} sent to Europe. A {{separate}} organization, the Liberty Guard, had been formed in 1910, primarily for social purposes: members marched in parades and at patriotic events. Governor Samuel Ralston had to call out the Liberty Guard in November 1913 to put down a growing workers strike in Indianapolis. By 1920, the state decided to formalize this group, renaming it <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> Civil Defense Force and supplying it with equipment and training. In 1941, the unit was named <b>the</b> <b>Indiana</b> Guard Reserve; it effectively became a state militia.
