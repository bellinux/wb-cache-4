40|$|Native prairie {{species have}} been both {{promoted}} and questioned in their ability <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> vegetative <b>covers</b> for green roofs. The green roof environment with its exposure to intense sun and wind and limited moisture restricts the capacity for a large diversity of species. The result has been, in many cases, a standard, low-diversity mix of Sedum species often focused on ornament and minimizes the potential for wider environmental benefits. We reviewed the ecological literature on prairie and grassland communities with specific reference to habitat templates from stressed environmental conditions and examined analogs of prairie-based vegetation on twenty-one existing green roofs. We found that many, but not all prairie and grassland species will survive and thrive on green roofs, especially when irrigated as needed or given adequate growing medium depth. We raise several important questions about media, irrigation, temperature, biodiversity and their interactions needing more study...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 This project {{contends that}} the pop {{cultural}} production of the subject of third wave feminism [...] an empowered sexy yet tough, glamorous yet powerful woman [...] is deeply entangled in racial symbolism that ultimately re-assert whiteness and maintain racial inequity. Investigating the songs, videos, and public performances of three contemporary white female pop stars [...] Fergie, Gwen Stefani, and Lady Gaga [...] the analysis unpacks the ways that racial symbols, sublimated cultural memories, and repudiated racial narratives circulate in these stars' music, lyrics, and video narratives as well as visual indicators such as fashion, hair, make-up, and posture. Because these performances represent and promote female empowerment in ways contested, yet consistent, with third wave rhetoric, some feminist critics tend to dismiss the racial dynamics as incidental or include them only in apologetic footnotes. This project not only re-centers race as a primary investigative lens, but examines {{how many of the}} discourses of female empowerment circulating in these pop performances are dependent on racial hierarchy for their efficacy. Using a critical semiotics approach, the aim of this dissertation is to contribute to the bigger project of decolonial feminism by cutting through the feminist alibi that allows feminism <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a <b>cover</b> story for the cultural reproduction of whiteness and racial hierarchy...|$|R
40|$|In {{terms of}} {{artillery}} from shipwreck sites, gun tubes are typically the most well researched artifacts. Small finds like lead cannon aprons get significantly less attention but they too can reveal {{a great deal}} of information about past technologies and behaviors. The goal of this project is to shed light on this little researched class of artifacts, using the assemblage from the Queen Anne's Revenge shipwreck site as a case study.   Historical accounts agree that an apron's primary function was <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a touchhole <b>cover</b> <b>to</b> keep powder dry and chambers debris free when a ship's guns were not in use. Beyond this, little is known about aprons. Interestingly, more than half the aprons in the QAR assemblage bear inscribed markings that are not explained by this primary function. Documentation and analysis of the Queen Anne's Revenge aprons will not only fill gaps in the current knowledge of 18 th century naval ordnance, it will also help tell the story of the unknown sailors who marked them.   M.

50|$|According to the 2001 Greek census, {{there were}} 797,091 {{documented}} foreigners living in Greece, {{with a large}} number from Albania, Romania, Russia, and the Ukraine. Ten years before that, the number of legal immigrants was only 30,000. By 2009, the immigrant population had expanded to 1.2 million in a country of just of 11 million citizens—legal immigrants make up more than 10% of the Greek population, and the number of illegal immigrants increases the percentage of immigrants even more. The exponential increase in migration <b>to</b> Greece <b>serves</b> <b>as</b> a <b>cover</b> for traffickers, and facilitates their transportation of women for work in the sex industry in Greece. Because of the ease with which traffickers can disguise foreign victims among the immigrant population, Greeks are not typically the targeted victims of traffickers; instead women are brought in from outside the country to fuel the sex industry. Women are brought to Greece from a variety of places, but a large number come from Eastern Europe—a full 50-55% of sex workers in Athens are from former Soviet bloc countries. Greece is also a destination country for a large number of trafficked Moldavians.|$|R
6000|$|... "Meanwhile I {{had been}} busy {{building}} {{a sort of}} hut. I piled great stones against {{the foot of the}} cliffs, and turned the boat upside down to form a roof. The men helped me to do that job the last thing before they started. Then I blocked up the entrance, leaving only just room for me to crawl in and out. The snow began to fall steadily three days after the others had gone, and very soon covered my hut two feet deep. I melted the blubber of the whale in the boat's baler, for we had towed the fish ashore. The first potful or two I boiled over a few bits of drift-wood. After that it was easy enough, as I unravelled some of the boat's rope, dipped it in the hot blubber, and made a store of big candles. There was a lot of meat left on the sea-cows, so I cut that up, froze it, and stowed as much as I could in the hut. I was bothered about the rest, as I knew the bears were likely to come down; but I found a ledge {{on the face of the}} perpendicular rock, and by putting the boat's mast against it I was able to get up to it. Here I piled, I should say, a ton of meat and blubber. Then I set to work and collected some dried grass, and soon I had enough <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> bed and <b>covers.</b> It took me a month to do all this, and by that time winter was down on me in earnest. I had spent my evenings in making myself, out of the skins of the three cows, breeches, high boots, and a coat with a hood over the head, and in order to make these soft I rubbed them with hot oil. They were rough things, but I hoped that I might get a bear later on. Fortunately the boat had two balers, for I required one in which to melt the snow over the lamp.|$|R
40|$|U radu se analizira {{fragment}} rukopisa pisan karolinom, pohranjen u Državnom arhivu u Zadru: utvrđuje se kojem pravnom djelu pripada, na temelju datacĳe određuje se njegova pozicĳa među drugim prĳepisima u europskim knjižnicama, ispituje se na koji se način srednjovjekovna pravna praksa odnosila prema izvorima te zaključuje da je rĳeč o zasada jedinom materĳalnom ostatku nekog pravnog priručnika iz ranosrednjovjekovne Dalmacĳe. Since its {{discovery in}} the 1920 s, a ninth-century fragment, {{written in the}} Caroline script and filed in the Miscellanea of the State Archives of Zadar (HR-DAZD- 377, vol. 182, position 2), has not att racted much attention, probably because it was erroneously identified {{as a part of}} a monastic Regula. In fact, the fragment pertains to the legal text in which the quotes from the Old Testament were combined with Roman law to provide rules for certain criminal law matters. The collection was known under the name Lex Dei quam praecepit Dominus ad Moysen, as well as under the title Collatio legum Mosaicarum et Romanarum given by a sixteenth-century editor; the identification has been supported by Bernhard Bishoff ’s recently published catalogue of the ninth-century manuscripts. According to the expertise of David Ganz, the fragment was written in the second half of the ninth century and its probable provenance is Northern Italy. The text of Lex Dei is more or less integrally preserved in three codices kept in Berlin (Deutsche Nationalbibliothek, MS. Lat. fol. 269, early ninth c.), Vienna (ÖNB, MS. 2160, late ninth c.), and Vercelli (Biblioteca Capitolare Eusebiana, MS. 122, fi rst half of the eleventh c.). On the ground of language peculiarities and transcription errors, it seems that the Zadar fragment is not directly related to any of them, but stems independently from the archetype. All the three codices with Lex Dei include also the Epitome Iuliani, a summarized translation of Justinian’s Novellae, and the numeration of the tituli demonstrates that the same was true of a manuscript the Zadar fragment was a part of. As already argued by different scholars, between the ninth and the eleventh century, Lex Dei was copied because it could <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a guideline <b>to</b> bishop’s jurisdiction, which expanded from the area of civil litigation towards penal matters. To determine whether the Lex Dei should be counted among legal sources of the early medieval Dalmatian towns, the fragment’s history has been examined. Archive research showed that the bifolium with the text was recycled in 1403 by the Zadar notary Articutius de Rivignano <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a <b>cover</b> of one of his registers. It was the custom of the same notary to re-use dispensable parchments he found in the city offices or in his own production, but upon this particular one he might have stumbled in the chapter premises, where he also provided notary services in 1389 – 1396. By then, the manuscript had certainly been dismembered for quite some time. In all likelihood, the codex with Lex Dei and Epitome Iuliani was brought to Zadar prior to the twelft h century, i. e. before the new flourishing legal culture off ered text-books of superior quality, and made such old manuals obsolete. Therefore, the Zadar fragment is the only material survival of any legal text that may have been used in early medieval Dalmatian practice...|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} {{acknowledged}} that the current advances in virtualisation and the ubiquity and pervasiveness of high-speed networking are driving a complete rethink of the paradigm whereby organisations deploy and manage their own services and infrastructures [1]. This has mainly resulted in the increased popularity of service provisioning models such as cloud services. Beside the technological context that has made it possible, there is an economical and performance incentive for embracing the trend. Indeed, the complexity of today’s systems and networks, and the cost associated with their management and maintenance, has prompted the re-emergence of the old type computing usage characterised by timesharing, usage-based pricing and shared resources [2]. The timesharing model arose because computers were expensive and hard to maintain, while in contrast, modern computers and networks are drastically cheaper, but still hard to maintain. Once again, it becomes convenient and cheaper to outsource, especially {{when one considers that}} computing is now seen as a utility. Despite these benefits, security in cloud services poses increased challenges for consumers, since both the data and programs of the consumers may reside in geographically different locations, yet often within the Cloud Service Providers’ (CSPs) premises. Several studies (including [3 – 5]) have pointed out that despite the potential benefits of cloud services, security remains one of the major concerns that hinders a large scale adoption by big and medium-size corporations. In fact, having one’s data stored and processed within one’s organisational administrative domain gives the chance to select the appropriate protection mechanisms, and decide {{who may or may not}} have access to the data. Once the processing and/or storage of the data is delegated to a third party, one can only hope that the decisions on security matters will be as good as one would expect. This has led numerous surveys and technical contributions to focus on the security of cloud-based services. For instance, Subashini and Kavitha [6] surveyed the security concerns pertaining to each of the cloud models (Software as a Service-SaaS, Platform as a Service-PaaS and Infrastructure as a Service- IaaS) with a synopsis on the existing security solutions. According to the authors, the main concern with SaaS, as reported by enterprise actors, is the lack of visibility about the way their data is stored and secured. In addition, they are concerned about insider breaches, along with vulnerabilities in the applications and systems’ availability that could lead to loss of sensitive data and money. With respect to IaaS, the authors highlighted it only provides basic security such as perimeter firewall and load balancing. Thus applications moving into the cloud will need higher levels of security provided at host level. The PaaS model is said to be prone <b>to</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a <b>cover</b> environment for hackers, as one can easily leverage the PaaS cloud infrastructure for malware command and control and target IaaS applications [6]. Indeed, the capability of PaaS cloud to provide an environment for full life cycle software development and testing hides a darker side or so called “Malware as a Service”. The key concern is that hackers, rather than running their malicious code from local resources, will now tend to leverage the PaaS to develop and manage malicious codes that would ultimately take aim at resources available on the Internet included IaaS infrastructure.|$|R
