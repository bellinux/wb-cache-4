500|$|Kahne {{appeared}} in victory lane {{in front of}} the crowd of 170,000 to celebrate his sixth win of the season earning him $305,889. Kahne was delighted with his victory and thanked the people who worked on his car's transmission and rear-end: [...] "We had a great car. It was unbelievable all night. I slammed it into second gear at the end of pit road one time and I thought I had to break something. This isn't the special car. This car's been good two other <b>times</b> <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> but it went to waste. It's just an awesome team." [...] Second-place finisher Johnson said he finished the event where he ran in its duration: “I only made up ten points. But ten points is ten points.” Third-place finisher Burton was happy to recover from a tire issue from the previous race at Talladega Superspeedway. However, he was upset that he stalled his engine as he felt it cost him the chance of victory. Burton also said his late-race vibration was enough to scare him and was glad the race ended because of the amount of shudder coming from his car: [...] "I screamed, ‘We’ve got a wheel loose, we got a wheel loose’ and they said, {{we do not have a}} wheel loose, we know we got them tight." ...|$|E

And here must I take the brown-and-white jug, as it's niver been used three <b>times</b> <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> and go down i' the cellar myself, and belike catch my death, and be laid up wi' inflammation...." ...|$|E

A leash went from it last Monday week. When a man really means a thing, Miss Palliser, he can pretty nearly always do it." [...] Miss Palliser replied {{with a smile that}} she thought that to be true, and Mr. Spooner was not slow at perceiving that this afforded good {{encouragement}} to him in regard to that matter which was now weighing most heavily upon his mind.|$|E
6000|$|What a man {{he would}} have been for London life! How he would have enjoyed his club, picking up {{the news of the day}} from all lips, while he seemed to give it to all ears! How popular {{he would have been}} at the Carlton, and how men would have listened to him while every great or little crisis was discussed! How supreme he would have sat on the Treasury bench, or how unanswerable, how fatal, how joyous, when attacking the Government from the {{opposite}} seats! How crowded would have been his rack with invitations to dinner! How delighted would have been the middle-aged countesses of the time to hold with him mild intellectual flirtations--and the girls of the period, how proud to get his autograph, how much prouder to have touched the lips of the great orator with theirs! How the pages of the magazines would have run over with little essays from his pen! [...] "Have you seen our Cicero's paper on agriculture? That lucky fellow, Editor ----, got him to do it last month!" [...] "Of course you have read Cicero's article on the soul. The bishops don't know which way to turn." [...] "So the political article in the Quarterly is Cicero's?" [...] "Of course you know the art-criticism in the <b>Times</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> is Tully's doing?" [...] But that would probably be a bounce. And then what letters he would write! With the penny-post instead of travelling messengers at his command, and pen instead of wax and sticks, or perhaps with an instrument-writer and a private secretary, he would have answered all questions and solved all difficulties. He would have so abounded with intellectual fertility that men would not have known whether most to admire his powers of expression or to deprecate his want of reticence.|$|E

Up to the arrival of Sir Evelyn Wood, the chiefs did not fully realise that they were really {{independent}} at all. Now they do, and if I mistake not, like a beggar on horseback will ride to the devil sharp. Oham has begun by killing a large number of the Amagalusi people. My information is derived from native sources, and may be somewhat exaggerated. It is that the killed at Isandhlwana were few compared with those killed by Uhamu a few days ago. Usibebu also and Undabuka are, I am told, on the point of coming to blows; and if they do that it will be worse still, for Undabuka will find supporters throughout the length and breadth of Zululand. Undabuka, the full brother of the ex-king, is the protege of the Bishop of Natal. The Bishop, I find, has again sent one of his agents (Amajuba by name) calling for another deputation. The deputation is now on its way to Natal, and that, I understand, against the express refusal of the Resident to allow it." [...] In the issue of 14th November is published a letter from Mr. Nunn, a gentleman well known in Zululand, from which, as it is too long to quote in its entirety, I give a few extracts:--"Oham's Camp, Oct.15.--The Zulus cannot comprehend the Transvaal affair, and it has been industriously circulated among them that the English have been beaten and forced to give back the Transvaal. They do not understand gracious acts of restoration after we have been beaten. Four <b>times</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> has Umnyamana called his army together and menaced Oham, who has several times had to have parties of his followers sleeping around his kraal in the hills adjacent, so as to give him timely notice to fly. When Oham left his kraal for the purpose of attending the meeting at Inslasatye, the same day the whole of the Maquilisini Tribe came on to the hills adjacent to Oham's kraal, the 'Injamin,' and threatened that district. This has been the case on two or three former occasions, and simultaneously Umnyamana's tribe and Undabuka's followers always flew to arms, thus threatening on all sides. [...] . Trading is and has been for months entirely suspended in this district. The fields are unplanted, no ploughs or Kafir-picks at work--all {{are in a state of}} excitement, not knowing the moment a collision may take place. Hunger will stare many in the face next year, and all the men yelling to their chiefs to be let loose and put an end to this state of uncertainty." ...|$|E
