2500|$|During the pre-code period, {{after the}} {{crack down on}} crime films, {{production}} of films featuring prurient elements increased. Studios began putting in extra suggestive material which they knew would never reach theaters. MGM screenwriter Donald Ogden Stewart said that [...] " [...] wouldn't want to take out too much, so you would give them five things to <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> satisfy the Hays Office—and you would {{get away with murder}} with what they left in." [...] In 1932 Warner Brothers' policy was that [...] "two out of five stories should be hot", and that nearly all films could benefit by [...] "adding something having to do with ginger." [...] Films such as Laughing Sinners, Safe in Hell, The Devil Is Driving, Free Love, Merrily We Go to Hell, Laughter in Hell and The Road to Ruin were provocative in their mere titles. Studios marketed their films, sometimes dishonestly, by coming up with suggestive tag lines and lurid titles, even {{going so far as to}} come up with in house contests for thinking up provocative titles for screenplays. Commonly labeled [...] "sex films" [...] by the censors, these pictures offended taste in more categories than just sexuality. According to a Variety analysis of 440 pictures produced in 1932–33, 352 had [...] "some sex slant", with 145 possessing [...] "questionable sequences", and 44 being [...] "critically sexual"." [...] The trade paper summarized that [...] "over 80% of the world's chief picture output was...flavored with bedroom essence." [...] Attempts to create films for adults only (dubbed [...] "pinking") only served to bring larger audiences of all ages to the cineplex.|$|E

60|$|A few of {{the slaves}} spoke to Gervaise as {{they were waiting for}} food to be brought them, but the {{majority}} dropped upon the rushes, too exhausted with toil and heat to feel an interest in anything. The food consisted of rye bread, with thin broth, brought in a great iron vessel. Each slave had a horn, which was used for soup or water, and which, when done with, he had, by the rule enforced among themselves, to <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the fountain in the courtyard and wash, before it was added to the pile {{in the corner of the}} room.|$|E
60|$|In {{the ensuing}} {{fortnight}} {{a great many}} gaieties besides the Egyptian ball took place, and Colville went wherever he and Imogene were both invited. He declined the quiet dinners which he liked, and which his hearty appetite and his habit of talk fitted him to enjoy, and accepted invitations {{to all sorts of}} evenings and At Homes, where dancing occupied a modest corner of the card, and usurped the chief place in the pleasures. At these places it was mainly his business to see Imogene danced with by others, but sometimes he waltzed with her himself, and then he was complimented by people of his own age, who had left off dancing, upon his vigour. They said they could not stand that sort of thing, though they supposed, if you kept yourself in practice, it did not come so hard. One of his hostesses, who had made a party for her daughters, told him that he was an example to everybody, and that if middle-aged people at home mingled more in the amusements of the young, American society would not be the silly, insipid, boy-and-girl affair that it was now. He went to these places in the character of a young man, but he was not readily accepted or recognised in that character. They gave him frumps to <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> supper, mothers and maiden aunts, and if the mothers were youngish, they threw off on him, and did not care for his talk.|$|E

"She dyed her {{fair skin}} with walnut, wore russet gown and hood, {{and was a}} very {{nightingale}} for blitheness and sweet song through that first year," [...] said Henry; [...] "blither than ever when that little one {{was born in the}} sunshiny days of Whitsuntide. I tell thee, those were happier days than ever I passed as Lord de Montfort at Kenilworth. But after that, the bruised hurt in my side, which had never healed when the cleaner gashes did, became more painful and troublesome. Holy wells did nothing for it; and she wasted with watching it, as though my pain had been hers. Naught would serve her but coming here, because she had been told that the Knights of St. John had better experience of old battle-wounds than any men in the realm. Much ado had we to get here--the young babe in her arms, and I well- nigh distraught with pain. We crept into this same hut, and I had a weary sickness throughout the winter--living, I know not how, by the bounty of the Spital, and by the works of her fingers, which Winny would <b>take</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> sell on feast-days in the city.

50|$|Similarly, {{trash cans}} {{that are used}} inside and then <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the street and emptied into a Dumpster can be small or large.

Here the {{trade-off}} is frequency of having <b>to</b> put <b>out</b> the trash in the Dumpster against weight of can and potential for injury. If food waste is being put into a trash can, {{there is a second}} trade-off for large versus small trash cans. With a large trash can, food waste will sit for a longer time in the kitchen, attracting cockroaches and rodents. With a small trash can, the can will be <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the Dumpster more often, thus attracting less pests in the kitchen.|$|R
