25|$|The 1938 Democratic Senate primary {{featured}} {{an intense}} showdown between Barkley, liberal {{spokesman for the}} New Deal, and conservative governor Happy Chandler. The governor was a gifted public speaker, combining voice control, emotionalism, and singing with an unusual ability <b>to</b> <b>personalize</b> his speeches. He could remember everyone's name, and in turn they became emotionally involved in his campaign speeches. Barkley's methodical campaigning was bolstered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt's strong endorsement. Barkley handily defeated Chandler, with 56% of the vote. Farmers, labor unions, and city machines gave Barkley his margin, a vote which reaffirmed {{the popularity of the}} New Deal in Kentucky. Only a few months later, Chandler was appointed to the state's other Senate seat upon the death of Senator Mills Logan.|$|E
500|$|Privacy {{advocates and}} other critics have {{expressed}} concern regarding Windows10's privacy policies and its collection and use of customer data.

Users can opt out from most of this data collection, but telemetry data for error reporting and usage is also sent to Microsoft, and this cannot be disabled on non-Enterprise versions of Windows10. Microsoft's privacy policy states, however, that [...] "Basic"-level telemetry data is anonymized and cannot {{be used to identify}} an individual user or device.

The third-generation iPad can be jailbroken with Redsn0w 0.9.12 or Absinthe 2.0. Jailbreaking violates the factory warranty. One of the main reasons for jailbreaking is to expand the feature set limited by Apple and its App Store. Most jailbreaking tools automatically install Cydia, a native iOS APT client used for finding and installing software for jailbroken iOS devices. Many apps unapproved by Apple are extensions and customizations for iOS and other apps.

500|$|The 1950s jump {{started an}} {{industry}} of aftermarket add-ons for cars that continues today.

[...] Holley introduced the first modular four-barrel carburetor, which Ford {{offered in the}} 1957 Ford Thunderbird, and versions are still used by performance enthusiasts. Edelbrock started during the Great Depression and expanded after the war. They provided a variety of high performance parts for the new hot rodders, which was popular equipment for setting speed records at Bonneville Salt Flats.

[...] Media sources picked up on the exchange, reporting that Keyes had [...] "trashed", [...] "attacked," [...] and [...] "lashed out at" [...] Mary Cheney, and had called her a [...] "sinner"—provoking condemnation of Keyes by LGBT Republicans and several GOP leaders. Keyes noted that it was an interviewer, not he, who brought up Mary Cheney's name in the above incident, and he told reporters, [...] "You have tried <b>to</b> <b>personalize</b> the discussion of an issue that I did not personalize.

Moore wanted the second part {{to focus more on}} Jammer's role within the NCP, as he wanted <b>to</b> <b>personalize</b> somebody working for the police force. He also wanted to make Tigh know he's wrong with launching suicide bombers, but has to do so if he believes doing so will defeat the Cylons. This is also Tigh's principal trait and role in the series. Moore stated [...] "why is Colonel Tigh on Galactica? Why does Adama keep him around? Because when the chips are down, and they are way down, baby, in this situation, when you are in a foxhole, who do you want next to you?

500|$|Given {{the task}} of forming the personalities of the Crash Nitro Kart cast through the full-motion videos, the Red Eye Studio artists set certain rules for how each {{character}} would carry itself by default. As animator Thomas Happ noted, [...] "N. Gin, for example, would always default to twitchy, side-to-side glances, while Tiny would often scratch his head in confusion. There {{were a lot of}} scenes where the characters are just standing around listening to Emperor Velo talk, and we had to invent ways <b>to</b> <b>personalize</b> their mannerisms and create a uniquely 'thinking character'." [...] To achieve the bold and deeply saturated colors and textures for the characters and environments, the artists used Maya as well as Adobe Photoshop and Corel Painter. While the artists adapted many of the sets and props in the cinematics from in-game counterparts, they recreated the majority of these objects from scratch in order to add surrealism to the scenery. The cinematics were completed well in advance of the four-month deadline. The console version of Crash Nitro Kart was announced by Vivendi Universal prior to the Electronic Entertainment Expo of 2003, while the N-Gage version was announced on February 16, 2004. Crash Nitro Kart is among the first titles to be developed using the Intrinsic Alchemy middleware technology following Vicarious Visions' purchase of its rights from the defunct Intrinsic Graphics.|$|E
500|$|A new guitar {{controller}} {{was developed}} for the game to help with [...] "shredding" [...] and an art style to match the changes made in the game's visuals. The guitar hardware has been significantly redesigned to locate most of the base electronics and wireless controls into the main fretboard of the unit, containing the colored fret buttons, strum and whammy bar, and other controls for interacting with the game console. As such, this allows {{the body of the}} guitar to be swappable with custom designs, allowing players <b>to</b> <b>personalize</b> the control to their wishes; one design will be exclusive to those that pre-order the game through GameStop. The new guitar controller remains backwards compatible with previous games. Within North America, the new drum kit is also sold individually or in bundles with Warriors of Rock. The kit had previously been packed with Band Hero in the United Kingdom and with the Wii version of Band Hero in North America, but otherwise was not sold separately. The drum kit is MIDI-enabled with a detachable [...] "drum brain" [...] allowing other drum kits to be used instead with the game, while the game's kit can be used with any MIDI-capable music editing system. The music video for Soundgarden's [...] "Black Rain", is animated by Titmouse, Inc., the same studio that performs the in-game animations for Guitar Hero as well as Metalocalypse, and includes images of a young man playing Guitar Hero using the new guitar controller introduced in Warriors of Rock.|$|E
