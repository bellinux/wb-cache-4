The sample can be catapulted from a slide or special culture dish by a defocused U.V laser pulse which generates a photonic force to propel the material off the slide/dish, a technique sometimes called Laser Micro-dissection Pressure Catapulting (LMPC). The dissected material is sent upward (up to several millimetres) to a microfuge <b>tube</b> <b>cap</b> or other collector which contains either a buffer or a specialized tacky {{material in the}} <b>tube</b> <b>cap</b> that the tissue will adhere to.

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} and fracture behaviors of multiwalled WS 2 nanotubes produced by large scale fluidized bed method were investigated under uniaxial tension using in situ {{transmission electron microscopy}} probing; these were directly correlated to the nanotube atomic structures.

Surprisingly, these rather thick WS 2 nanotubes could bear much higher loadings than the thin WS 2 nanotubes with almost "defect-free" structures studied previously. In addition, the fracture strength of the "thick" nanotubes did not show common size dependent degradation when the tube diameters increased from approximately 20 to approximately 60 nm.

40|$|One {{limitation}} of small amplicon melting is {{the inability to}} genotype certain nearest-neighbor symmetric variations without manipulating the sample. We have developed a method for these exceptions: a high-resolution melting single nucleotide extension assay. Single nucleotide extension was performed in a new instrument, the LightScanner 32 (LS 32), which uses capillary reaction tubes and is capable of real-time PCR and sequential high-resolution melting of 32 samples. Asymmetric PCR used Platinum Taq and LC Green Plus in the master mix for target amplification. Dideoxynucleotides and extension oligonucleotides were sequestered in the <b>tube</b> <b>cap</b> and added post-PCR, maintaining a closed system. One dideoxynucleotides was used per capillary tube. Samples were cycled five times to incorporate dideoxynucleotides into the extension products using ThermoSequenase, followed by high-resolution melting. Single nucleotide polymorphisms from the RET proto-oncogene (n = 7), hemochromatosis (HFE, n = 30), coagulation factor 2 (F 2, n = 29), coagulation factor 5 (F 5, n = 30), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR, n = 60) genes were genotyped. The DNA melting profiles identified the target single nucleotide polymorphisms by the lowest melting temperature transition. All genotypes had a distinctive melting pattern. The method was 100 % concordant with samples previously genotyped at HFE, MTHFR, and F 2 and 90 % concordant with F 5. F 5 discordants were genotyped correctly by redesigning the assay.

However, this type of PCR is notorious for contamination problems related to the processing of the product {{between the first and}} the second PCR steps. In order to have a PCR method that is just as efficient but without the risk of contamination, we attempted the optimization of a single-tube nested PCR (STNPCR) method. During the first and the second PCR steps, we used the small subunit of ribosomal RNA (ssu rRNA) and the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) as targets, respectively. The performances of STNPCR and nested PCR in detecting the DNA of Leishmania chagasi were compared. In the case of STNPCR, the inner primers were immobilized on the interior of the <b>tube</b> <b>cap</b> by means of adsorption microtubes and then were solubilized before the second reaction. This procedure eliminated the need to open the microtube, which could have led to false-positive results through cross-contamination. The detection limit for the purified L. chagasi DNA was 1 fg by using nested PCR and 10 fg by using STNPCR. We also tested the specificity of the system against other parasites, and observed that Trypanosoma cruzi DNA was amplified with a detection limit of up to 1 pg.

The determination of detector characteristics {{was obtained from the}} detector enumeration with diameter variation, types of gas field, and temperature operation changes on Cs- 137 radiation. Data obtained from detector characteristics’ determination were the data count. Geiger Muller detector manufacturing process was started from the preparation of materials, the cathode tube and <b>tube</b> <b>cap</b> manufacture, installation of the detector and anode cap, vacuum tubes, gas fill, detector characteristic test, and data acquisition. The detector was made of stainless steel, the anode of tungsten wire with the length of 100 mm and diameters of 11 mm, 16 mm, 24 mm, and the anode diameter of 0. 08 mm. The gas field used alcohol argon and bromine argon, while for the temperature variation was increased from the temperature of 30 ºC to 70 ºC. Data obtained from the detector test were in the form of counts per minute (cpm) as a function of operating voltage (V) of the detector. From data of the test, it was illustrated the counting-per-minute graph on the detector’s operation voltage, so that the plateau, slope and resolving time of the detector could be determined. Research results obtained showed that the volume of the detector tube was influential on the detector characteristic curve. When the detector tube was varied, the initial voltage also changed. The change of gas field types also affected the detector characteristic curve. If the gas field type used argon gas having low ionization potential, the initial voltage of the detector would be smaller.
