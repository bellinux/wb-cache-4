40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} to analyse the Toyotist way of {{production in the}} post-Fordist era. The intention is {{to prove that the}} model, since its origins, has similar characteristics to those that originated the Fordism in the United States and was fundamental in the substitution of the latter after its collapse to the post-Fordist model. The study presents the influence of the model in the socio-cultural, political and economical aspects on the Japanese society and, then, the replication of its elements beyond the borders of Japan. Furthermore, the <b>Toyotism</b> is here presented as the model that restructured the capitalist system and kept it in the core and the basis of the flexibilisation in the post-Fordist era. For that, I am going to apply Gramsci’s theoretical framework in the discussion believing that the author’s preoccupation with the extension of the transformation within the working environment influences also the social, political and economical spheres of the society. The analysis made by the author on the Fordism in the United States is going to be used as the framework to this study to interpret the <b>Toyotism</b> and its consequences in these spheres. The scrutiny contains productive elements, changes and characteristics of the workers and the influence of theses changes in governments’ policies. The starting point is the analysis of the Fordism in the United State and the birth of a new accumulation system since this model is the predecessor and the basis of the Japanese <b>Toyotism.</b> Then, the decline of the model and the rigidity crises will be in the focus in order to present the <b>Toyotism,</b> the flexibilisation of the production and the changes that this model brought to the world’s society and productive system.

Desenvolve-se o toyotismo, ideologia orgânica da nova produção capitalista, 'momento predominante' da reestruturação produtiva do capital. Sob o toyotismo, tende a constituir-se, pelo menos como 'promessa frustrada' do capital, o que iremos denominar 'compressão psicocorporal'.

From a certain perpective, such models are not only the result of a choice of production system (and, in particular, of a logistics option) of the firm but of a particular industrial organization, on the limits of the control of the firm. In other words, Fordism couldn’t but emerge in United States of America while <b>Toyotism</b> but in Japan as these two countries know different systems of corporate governance which are materialized in particular supplier-client relations. The answer to the question whether one of these models is optimal for a particular industry in a particular period must be paired with a fundamental debate on the control relationship of the firm towards its industrial suppliers and clients.

Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs a case study approach using data obtained from 30 personal interviews, field notes, observations, and internet media sources. Findings: The paper reports how <b>Toyotism</b> shares three common features with Brahminism - renunciation, performance, and perfection - and how antipathy towards the manner in which these features were implemented in India caused significant resistance amongst the production workforce. Research limitations/implications: The paper has implications for academics and practitioners in helping to understand how employee relations, unrest and antagonism towards lean manufacturing practices are closely related to cross-cultural issues prevalent in host countries. Originality/value: The concept of Brahmanism in Indian employee relations is under-researched in comparison with other aspects of Indian culture and antipathy towards the concept as a source of resistance to the implementation of lean systems needs to be better understood. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|E

40|$|A realizaÃÃo dessa pesquisa partiu do interesse de explorar a relaÃÃo entre a consciÃncia dos trabalhadores e a implantaÃÃo dos modelos produtivos de base toyotista, devido ao carÃter pouco tematizado desta conexÃo. O objetivo central dessa investigaÃÃo foi analisar o tipo de consciÃncia dos trabalhadores a partir da implantaÃÃo de um modelo produtivo baseado nos pressupostos do toyotismo, e os reflexos desse modelo na vida profissional e pessoal dos funcionÃrios. Seus objetivos especÃficos foram: verificar os reflexos do modelo produtivo na prÃtica profissional do trabalhador; analisar o tipo de consciÃncia do trabalhador, a partir da implantaÃÃo do modelo produtivo baseado nos princÃpios do toyotismo, e seus reflexos na compreensÃo das mudanÃas no perfil profissional e no ambiente de trabalho; verificar os impactos do modelo produtivo baseado nos princÃpios toyotistas na vida pessoal do trabalhador. A opÃÃo metodolÃgica foi pelo mÃtodo materialista histÃrico dialÃtico, atravÃs de um estudo de caso em uma empresa do ramo tÃxtil. A empresa pesquisada foi escolhida por ter implantado um modelo produtivo de base toyotista desde 1994. Foram {{realizadas}} sete entrevistas semidiretivas com funcionÃrios de ambos os sexos, que trabalhavam nas diversas Ãreas, sem restriÃÃo quanto ao nÃvel hierÃrquico e funÃÃo e que foram admitidos em 1993, um ano antes da implantaÃÃo do modelo e que continuam trabalhando na empresa atÃ a presente data. Constatou-se que a implantaÃÃo do modelo produtivo provocou mudanÃas na rotina de trabalho, principalmente atravÃs da introduÃÃo das ferramentas: procedimento operacional e 5 S. Percebeu-se que o modelo produtivo adotado na empresa nÃo foi disseminado de forma sistÃmica. Houve uma intensificaÃÃo do trabalho apÃs a implantaÃÃo do modelo produtivo, principalmente no setor produtivo. Verificou-se que o tipo de consciÃncia predominante nos trabalhadores entrevistados Ã a consciÃncia transitiva ingÃnua porque existe uma compreensÃo da realidade, entretanto, ainda nÃo hÃ o aprofundamento da anÃlise dos fenÃmenos, o entendimento das conexÃes que se estabelecem entre eles, a problematizaÃÃo da realidade, bem como a existÃncia de uma postura prÃpria, ativa, de transformaÃÃo da realidade. Constatou-se tambÃm que independente de variÃveis como formaÃÃo escolar e nÃvel hierÃrquico, algumas prÃticas do modelo produtivo tiveram repercussÃes na vida pessoal dos entrevistados, mais especificamente, na vida familiar. The {{realization of}} this research arose from the interest of exploring {{the relation between the}} workersâ conscience and the implantation of productive models from a <b>toyotism</b> base, due to the little explored character of this connection. The main objective of this investigation was to analyze the kind of workersâ conscience from the implantation of a productive model based on the <b>toyotism</b> postulations, and the reflexes of this model in the professional and personal lives of the employees. The objectives were: to verify the reflexes of the productive model in the professional practice of the employee, to analyze the kind of conscience of the employees from the implantation of the productive model based on the principles of <b>toyotism,</b> and its reflexes in the understanding of the changes both in the professional profile and work environment, and to verify the impacts of the productive model based on toyotist principles in the personal life of the worker. The methodological option was the materialistic historic dialectic method through a study case in a textile company. The researched company was chosen for having implanted a toyotist base productive model since 1994. Seven semi-directive interviews were performed with employees from both sexes who worked in various areas, without any restriction as to the hierarchic level and position, who were hired in 1993, one year before the implantation of the model, and who are still working in the company up to the present moment. It was verified that the implantation of the productive model caused changes in the work routine, especially through the introductions of the tools: operational procedure and 5 S. It was noticed that the productive model used in the company was not disseminated in a systemic way. There was an intensification of work after the implantation of the productive model, mainly in the productive department. It was verified that the kind of predominant conscience in the interviewed employees is the transitive ingenious conscience because there is an understanding of the reality. Thus, there is not yet the deepening of the analysis of the phenomena, the understanding of the connections that are established among them, the problems related to reality as well as the existence of an active proper posture of transformation of the reality. It was also proved that independence of variables as school education and hierarchic level and some practices of the productive model had effects in the personal and, more specifically, family life of the interviewed employees...|$|E

O que pretendemos destacar é que ao longo do desenvolvimento do processo de trabalho - do taylorismo ao toyotismo - as transformações não significaram ruptura com o caráter capitalista do modo de produção e com seu complexo plano ideológico de controle da subjetividade do trabalhador. Exemplos disso são a apologia do individualismo, o aumento do desemprego, da intensificação e da precarização do trabalho, que marcam o mundo do trabalho na sociedade contemporânea.

40|$|Focussing {{primarily}} on Europe, this paper examines {{the evolution of}} the production technology associated with Henry Ford. Key elements identified are mass and flow production, the progress of which are traced from the early nineteenth century. The concentration of standardised demand, necessary for mechanisation and therefore mass production, was in war-related production and often state industry. Flow production involved linked processes and could be undertaken with malleable materials such as pastry and wood pulp but required the development of powerful machine tools to extend on a large scale to metal products. These tools were developed in the US {{towards the end of the}} nineteenth century under the stimulus of skilled labour shortages and raw material abundance. European conditions required compromises with this American technology, both because markets were less extensive and because skilled labour was more abundant. Some of these compromises might be described as ‘flexible production’, for example the early development of internal combustion motor vehicle technology in Europe. But the same technologies and organisations could not compete in supplying the mature, standardised, products. The Ford production line was created experimentally, through many trials and errors. Success bred complacency and institutional sclerosis, allowing General Motors to get ahead in the US during the later 1920 s and European producers to develop their own high volume models and production styles. Japanese competition in the form of <b>Toyotism</b> or lean production adopted a different approach to their workforces; an alternative organisation rather than machine technology. German arrangements, running second to the Japanese in efficiency in the 1980 s, also depended on the skills of their workforce even though often used in unskilled tasks. Despite employing similar machine technologies, national styles of production and productivity persisted, because national infrastructures, especially training systems, continued to differ...|$|E
40|$|The main {{research}} questions for this local study of Tarkett AB, a floor manufacturer, {{are based on}} the central characteristics of the third industrial revolution: globalization, technological development, and organizational change. As a background to the local development and change {{towards the end of the}} twentieth century, I have chosen to emphasize, on the one hand, the increasing need of the industry for internationalization, rationalization, and productivity development after fordism and the demise of the regulated “real wages capitalism” in the middle of the 1970 s, and, on the other, the work rights offensive of the labor movement in the 1970 s and its continued struggle for economic and industrial authority. The method to analyze the essential traits of the organizational change process has aimed to construe a field of organizational change whose ideal types are based on taylorism, <b>toyotism,</b> flexible specialization, just-in-time, and lean production. Methods used to analyze change from the perspective of social structuration are also related to the theories of dynamic contradictory class locations, local hegemony, and gender. Apart from traditional source material and interviews, the study builds on the results from a study group consisting of a number of factory workers from Tarkett. Technological change and development (IT) of the work process on the factory floor has been analyzed as technological rationalization, quality development, work environment improvement, and as issues of gender relations and class positions at the work place. As regards the management process, leadership and control, centralization and decentralization concepts are vital. In matters concerning working conditions, including salaries, working hours, and job profiles (qualifications required for employment) are central. The management process was subject to changes that entailed deviations from the principles of traditional tayloristic management philosophy. Instead a participant change strategy implemented decentralized leadership functions in the shape of management by objectives via autonomous groups according to principles of ”responsible autonomy”. The investigation shows that computer-aided centralized control functions, competence improvement, and intensified ideological control worked together to change the management process. Decentralization of responsibility, the integration of white-collar like duties, the general competence development, and the higher demands on job qualifications, combined to render workers’ class locations more contradictory. This, together with ideological control and change, contributed to consolidate local hegemony...|$|E
40|$|Este trabalho tem como objetivo geral demonstrar que a reengenharia foi a forma concebida pelo capital para consolidar a reestruturaÃÃo produtiva no nÃvel das empresas, na dÃcada de 1990, apropriando-se, em seguida, dos processos de educaÃÃo no trabalho, a fim de dar suporte conceitual a essas mudanÃas. A metodologia utilizada foi bibliogrÃfica, utilizando-se categorias empÃrico-descritivas, as que sÃo centrais para o trabalho, heurÃstico-interpretativas, que auxiliam a compreensÃo das primeiras e conceitos operacionais de suporte, utilizados para a compreensÃo dos demais tÃpicos do trabalho. A anÃlise parte da abordagem da reestruturaÃÃo produtiva do capital como um processo que compatibilizou mudanÃas institucionais e organizacionais nas relaÃÃes de produÃÃo e trabalho, bem como redefiniÃÃo de papÃis dos estados nacionais e das instituiÃÃes financeiras, visando resgatar os nÃveis de lucratividade e acumulaÃÃo dos anos pÃs-Segunda Guerra Mundial. Para aplicar os princÃpios da reestruturaÃÃo produtiva e do toyotismo, prÃtica japonesa de intensificaÃÃo do trabalho, o capitalismo se utilizou da reengenharia, ferramenta produzida pela escola {{americana}} de negÃcios que visava reestruturar as empresas priorizando-se os seus processos essenciais. A reengenharia influenciou uma sÃrie de obras para dar sustentaÃÃo ao seu modelo no campo do saber da administraÃÃo que, simultaneamente, tambÃm absorveu as abordagens de uma tendÃncia de comportamento social chamada de pÃs-modernidade. A produÃÃo de conhecimento desse campo do saber, como principal elaborador dos processos de educaÃÃo corporativa, deu origem a uma sÃrie de obras que se caracterizava pela defesa das mudanÃas causadas pela reengenharia, por um lado, e pelo outro, por uma crescente superficialidade no tratamento de questÃes sÃrias da vida empresarial. Recebendo esses conteÃdos do campo do saber da administraÃÃo, as empresas passaram a desenvolver os processos de educaÃÃo no trabalho e a formar seus trabalhadores em trÃs dimensÃes: individual, atravÃs dos trenamentos do tipo coaching e mentoring; grupal, por meio do desenvolvimento de equipes; e coletiva, consubstanciada atravÃs das universidades corporativas. Em todas as dimensÃes, o capital se utilizou das caracterÃsticas dos prÃprios processos de capacitaÃÃo para dar sustentaÃÃo conceitual Ã reestruturaÃÃo produtiva iniciada na dÃcada de 1990. This present Thesis has as {{its general}} objective the demonstration that reengineering was the way conceived by the capital to consolidate productive restructuring at firmsÂ level, in the 1990 Âs, and as a second step, appropriating the processes of labor education, {{in order to provide}} conceptual support to the changes proposed. The methodology used is both bibliographic, utilizing empirical-descriptive cathegories, those fundamental to this Thesis, and heusristic-interpretative cathegories that help understanding the first ones, besides supportive operational concepts intended to make further topics of this Thesis fully understood. The analysis starts from the approach of productive restructuring of the capital as a process that allowed institutional and organizational changes in the relation between production and labor, as well as the redefinition of the rÃles of national states and financial institutions, aiming at the recovering of the levels of profitability and wealth accumulation of post-WWII years. In order to apply the principles of productive restructuring and of <b>toyotism,</b> a Japanese practice aimed at labor intensification, the capitalism used reengineering, a tool designed by American school of business intended to restructure firms by prioritizing their essential processes. Reengineering has influenced a series of writings that were meant to support its model in the field of management knowledge, which simultaneously absorbed the approaches of a social behavior tendency called postmodernism. The produce of this field of knowledge, as the main elaborator of corporative educational processes, gave origin to a series of writings that were characterized, in one hand, by the defense of changes brought by reengineering, and in the other hand, by a growing superficiality in the treatment of serious questions related to business life. Upon receiving such contents from the fields of management knowledge, firms started to develop processes on labor education and to form their laborers under three dimensions: individual, by means of coaching and mentoring training methods; group, through team development; and collective, consubstantiated through corporative universities. In all the above dimensions, capital used inherent characteristics of the very processes of qualification to give conceptual support to the productive restructuring that was initiated in the decade of 1990...|$|E
40|$|Resumo: A década de 90 trouxe grandes mudanças nas relações entre o Estado, as empresas e os trabalhadores no Brasil. Na indústria automotiva, a abertura {{comercial}} permitiu às montadoras aplicar estratégias globais no suprimento de autopeças, configurando uma cadeia de fornecimento hierarquizada, onde, nos primeiros níveis, estão as fabricantes de sistemas completos dos veículos (sistemistas), as quais também reproduzem estas relações com suas fornecedoras. Acompanhando este processo, mudanças na gestão do trabalho têm reformulado as estruturas de cargos nas plantas, exigindo novas competências aos assalariados e alterando o relacionamento que mantêm entre si nas esferas gerenciais e operacionais, fatos que se refletiram na própria organização do movimento sindical. Focando tais transformações no setor de autopeças da região de Campinas, os objetivos desta tese são compreender: (1) os principais aspectos das relações estabelecidas entre plantas filiais de grupos transnacionais com suas matrizes, bem como com suas clientes e fornecedoras, nos processos de hierarquização e redução da cadeia automotiva, cujo deslanchar no Brasil ocorreu em meio à desnacionalização deste setor; (2) como estes aspectos se relacionam com a implantação da gestão flexível do trabalho nestas plantas filiais, inclusive no tocante à conjugação de métodos dos sistemas taylorista/fordista e toyotista; (3) como tais mudanças têm afetado os trabalhadores, seja quanto aos perfis profissionais e educacionais exigidos e o montante de empregos ofertados, seja quanto às formas de mobilização e negociação sindicais construídas neste contexto. Para a consecução destes objetivos, revisamos a literatura sobre a reestruturação produtiva e sua difusão no Brasil após os anos 90, e realizamos um estudo de caso empírico numa empresa transnacional, situada na região de Campinas e fornecedora tanto de grandes sistemistas de autopeças quanto de montadoras. O Sindicato dos Metalúrgicos de Campinas também foi pesquisado, mediante entrevistas junto à sua direção e presidência, nas quais se abordaram as ações desta entidade em face da reestruturação produtiva nas empresas e das políticas neoliberais, suas concepções acerca das conseqüências destes processos sobre os trabalhadores, bem como o relacionamento que o sindicato vem tendo com a CUT. Os resultados mostram que a desnacionalização do setor de autopeças brasileiro teve profunda relação com as estratégias globais dos grupos transnacionais desta indústria, refletindo um embate entre corporações dos EUA e da Europa frente ao avanço da concorrência nipônica, liderada pela Toyota, embate no qual têm contado com a atuação dos Estados e das classes trabalhadoras. A implantação da gestão flexível nas plantas filiais de países periféricos, por sua vez, não apenas é parte desta luta mundial pela acumulação de capital, como a reproduz no próprio relacionamento cotidiano entre os assalariados, das gerências ao chão de fábrica, onde a hibridez do taylorismo/fordismo com o toyotismo tem configurado perfis de qualificação que fragmentam social, econômica e politicamente os trabalhadores. Por fim, a terceirização e o desemprego que emergiram destes processos têm imposto obstáculos à ação sindical, levando tensões e rupturas entre instâncias locais, estaduais e federais nos setores mais combativos, como ilustra o rompimento do Sindicato dos Metalúrgicos de Campinas com a CUTAbstract: The Nineties brought {{significant changes}} to the relations among the state, the companies and the working class in Brazil. In the automotive industry, the commercial opening allowed car assembly companies to utilize global strategies on its parts supply, forming a hierarchized supply chain where, in the first levels are the manufacturers of complete vehicle systems (systemists), which also reproduce these relations with their suppliers. Following this process, changes in work management have remodeled the position structures in plants, demanding new competences to working class and altering the relationship that is maintained among them on the operational and managerial aspects, facts that reflected in the own union movement organization. Focusing on such transformations in the automotive components sector {{in the region of}} Campinas, this study is aimed at: (1) the main aspects of the relations established among branch plants belonging to transnational groups towards their headquarters, clients and suppliers, in the hierarquization and reduction of automotive chain whose boom occurred during this sector?s denationalization; (2) how these aspects are related to the implantation of flexible work management in these branch plants, including {{when it comes to the}} taylorist/fordist and toyotist systems; (3) how these changes have affected working class, whether to their required personal and educational skills, whether to their union mobilization and negotiations build in this context. In order to achieve these goals, we went over the literature about productive restructuration and its spread across Brazil after the nineties, and we carried out an empirical study case in a transnational company, located in the region of Campinas and both supplier of big automotive components and assembly companies. The Sindicato dos Metalúrgicos de Campinas was also surveyed, through interviews along with its management running, in which actions of this institution were approached in the face of companies productive restructuration and neo-liberal policies, their conceptions about the consequences of these processes to the working class, as well as the good relationship the union has had with CUT. Results have shown that the automotive components sector denationalization had a deep relation with the global strategies of transnational groups of this industry, reflecting a struggle between American?s and European?s corporations against the Nipponese competition, led by Toyota, struggle which has counted on States and the working class. The flexible management implantation in the branch plants of peripheral countries, on the other hand, is not only part of this world struggle for capital accumulation, as well as the reproduction on the daily relations among in shop floor managers, where the taylorism/fordism hybridity along with <b>toyotism</b> systems have formed profiles of qualification that fragment socially, economically and politically the working class. Lastly, outsourcing and unemployment which rose from these processes have build big roadblocks to union actions, conducting strains and ruptures among local, state and federal institutions in the most combative sectors, as it has shown the disruption between Sindicato dos Metalúrgicos de Campinas and CU...|$|E

Enriching Production was edited by professor Åke Sandberg, Arbetslivsinstitutet/ National Institute for Working Life and KTH The Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm. Enriching Production was followed up by a symposium on the general theme of ‘Good work and productivity’. The papers were collected in a special issue of Economic and Industrial Democracy, Vol. 19, No 1, February 1998. There will also be follow up articles on Volvo and alternative production systems in a forthcoming reader Absolut management. Scandinavian perspectives on management in the new working life, {{to be published by}} SNS förlag, Stockholm, 2007 / 2008. Abstract Both researchers and practitioners in industrial organization ask themselves today whether lean production is the only possible model for the future. Enriching Production proposes a radically different alternative, which was put into practice at Volvo’s Uddevalla plant during its brief life span. Skilled workers in autonomous teams could altogether abandon the assembly line. With a work content of several hours they built cars according to customer order, with a short delivery time, thus avoiding stocks. In spite of its good performance the plant was closed after only a few years without having developed its full potential. Enriching Production explains the design of the Uddevalla plant and tries to understand its closure against a background of organizational politics and Volvo’s production structure. In comparative chapters the NUMMI and Saturn plants in the US and European car manufacturers are contrasted to the Uddevalla model and also to Volvo’s Kalmar plant with still another form of group work. Chapters on social problems with lean production and recent developments in Japanese car manufacturing also contribute to an understanding of where the car building industry and the organization of industrial production is heading. Although the Uddevalla plant in its original form was closed, the vision of competitive systems of production that do not destroy but enhance human competencies and in a a wider sense a human working life lives on. Enriching Production contributes by reminding us that under certain circumstances good and competitive ways of arranging production are possible.

Writing context References, commentaries, critics “This book [...] a careful selection of well informed and provoking papers [...] provides a solid basis for a reassessment of the socio-technical experiments at the Uddevalla plant and for a critical debate of the lean production system in industry. ” Prof. Dr. Frieder Naschold “This volume should come to represent a classic for all those interested in different national and international trajectories of work and design in industry. ” Alan Jenkins, in Organization Studies “An invaluable aspect of Sandberg’s book is the wealth of comparative information, not only about other Volvo plants in Sweden, but also with regard to those in the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, Malaysia and Canada. … this invaluable collection of readings raises a wide range of additional questions which takes the critical debate about lean production significantly further. Its message is not only of relevance to academics, and managers unconvinced by the evangelical enthusiasm of many advocates of lean production, but also to those trade unions which are keen to preserve their independence through the development of new bargaining strategies {{in the face of an}} onslaught of new management techniques. ” Dave Beale, in Industrial Relations Journal “… this is an important book and one to be read by academics and practitioners alike. Although it appears as a narrative relating to a single company, it goes beyond this; asking what it is we seek from work reforms. ” Peter Cressey, in New Technology, Work and Employment “This book closes the chapter on Uddevalla’s heroic experiment. It helps the sympathetic reader understand what really happened there, and it draws out the positive lessons of Uddevalla for the very unfinished chapter of ongoing worldwide production and work reorganization in today’s turbulent markets. ” Lowell Turner, in Industrial and Labour Relations Review “…essential reading for all those interested in the auto industry and the challenging innovations associated with Volvo. ” Russel Lansbury, in Economic and Industrial Democracy “…detailed and compelling…Enriching Production provides researchers with a very deep vein of information and analysis. ” Steve Babson, in Work and Occupations “This is a valuable collection…for researchers in this area, and for those who teach in the field, this is a useful addition to the literature. ” Human Resource Management Journal “By its rich content, Enriching production is a good vehicle for keeping the discourse on alternative production systems rolling; and on the road” Lars Normann Mikkelsen, in Acta Sociologica Curent relevance See also ✔ Freyssenet M., “La production réflexive, une alternative à la production de masse et à la production au plus juste?”, Sociologie du Travail, n° 3 / 1995, pp 365 - 388.
