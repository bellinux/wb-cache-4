Vavilakolanu Subba Rao, known as ‘Andhra Valmiki’ for translating Valmiki’s Ramayana (the Hindu epic that narrates Rama's tale) into Telugu also spent his <b>time</b> <b>here</b> worshipping Rama.

5|$|Link is rescued at Windfall Island by {{a talking}} boat, the King of Red Lions, who {{explains}} that the bird's master is a returned Ganon. To defeat him, Link must find the Hero of Time's power, which requires the three Pearls of the Goddesses. Link finds Din's Pearl on Dragon Roost Island, home of the avian Rito and the dragon Valoo; Farore's Pearl in Forest Haven, home of the Great Deku Tree and the plant-like Koroks; and Nayru's Pearl with the water spirit Jabun on Outset Island. The King of Red Lions then takes Link to the Tower of the Gods, where he faces trials before descending beneath the ocean to a castle suspended in <b>time.</b> <b>Here</b> Link finds the Hero of Time's weapon, the Master Sword.|$|E
5|$|Middle Anglia as a {{political}} entity may have been created by Penda {{as an expression of}} Mercian power in the area following his victories over the East Angles. Previously there seem to {{have been a number of}} small peoples inhabiting the region, and Penda's establishment of Peada as a subking there may have marked their initial union under one ruler. The districts corresponding to Shropshire and Herefordshire, along Mercia's western frontier near Wales, probably also fell under Mercian domination at this <b>time.</b> <b>Here</b> a king called Merewalh ruled over the Magonsaete; in later centuries it was said that Merewalh was a son of Penda, but this is considered uncertain. Stenton, for example, considered it likely that Merewalh was a representative of a local dynasty that continued to rule under Mercian domination.|$|E

During his <b>time</b> <b>here,</b> Fischbach {{continued}} {{his work on the}} ARIA protein. When ARIA isolated from chick embryo brain was applied to chicken myotubes, which are developing chicken muscle fibers, it was shown to increase the rate of insertion of acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes. This indicated ARIA could play a role in acetylcholine receptor insertion in neuromuscular junctions. Additionally, it was demonstrated that ARIA stimulated the transcription of α acetylcholine receptor subunits leading to an increase in α subunit messenger RNA (mRNA) and precursors, but had no effect on the mRNA levels of the γ or δ acetylcholine receptor subunits. This indicated that the amount α acetylcholine receptor subunit limits the synthesis and subsequent insertion of acetylcholine receptors into chicken myotube membranes.|$|E

He commented that: All my <b>time</b> <b>here</b> was spent in heaving dead bodies into the mass graves kindly dug for us by 'outside workers' for we no longer had the strength for that type of work which, fortunately, must have been observed by the camp authorities. Jungle law reigned among the prisoners; at night you killed or were killed; by day cannibalism was rampant.|$|E
25|$|Rameau {{was taught}} music {{before he could}} read or write. He was educated at the Jesuit college at Godrans, {{but he was not}} a good pupil and {{disrupted}} classes with his singing, later claiming that his passion for opera had begun at the age of twelve. Initially intended for the law, Rameau decided {{he wanted to be a}} musician, and his father sent him to Italy, where he stayed for a short while in Milan. On his return, he worked as a violinist in travelling companies and then as an organist in provincial cathedrals before moving to Paris for the first <b>time.</b> <b>Here,</b> in 1706, he published his earliest known compositions: the harpsichord works that make up his first book of Pièces de clavecin, which show the influence of his friend Louis Marchand.|$|E
25|$|The {{books of}} those that wrote before us survive, and {{therefore}} we are taught about what was written then. For this reason it is good that we also in our <b>time,</b> <b>here</b> among us, write some material from scratch, inspired by the example of these old customs; so that it might, when we are dead and elsewhere, {{be left to the}} world's ear in the time coming after this. But because men say, and it's true, that when someone writes entirely about wisdom, it often dulls a man's wit who reads it every day. For that reason, if you permit it, I would like to take the middle way, and write a book between the two, somewhat of passion, somewhat of instruction, that whether of high or low status, people may like what I write about.|$|E

These have been identified as Cupid, Minerva, Prudence, Abundance, Saturn, and two figures of Pheme, all indicated by their traditional attributes, all bestowing their bounties on the Queen. (Cupid has his arrow; Prudence carries a snake entwined around her arm to indicate serpent-like wisdom; Abundance also appears with her cornucopia, also a reference to the fruits of Marie's regency. Minerva, goddess of wisdom, bears her helmet and shield and stands near Marie's shoulder, signifying her wise rule. Saturn has his sickle and is personified as <b>Time</b> <b>here</b> guiding France forward. Fame carries a trumpet to herald the occasion.)

The stage began with a loop to the south of Breda, around Ulvenhout, then crossed the finish line to begin a much larger loop.
