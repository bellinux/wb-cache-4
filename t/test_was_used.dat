25|$|The {{dictation}} <b>test</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> {{again in}} 1936, controversially and {{for reasons that}} were never made clear, to exclude Mabel Freer, a white British woman born in India, who was confronted with a test in Italian. Interior Minister Thomas Paterson resigned from the Lyons Cabinet following the controversy. The test was not abolished until 1958.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of neurosarcoidosis often is difficult. Definitive diagnosis {{can only be}} made by biopsy (surgically removing a tissue sample). Because of {{the risks associated with}} brain biopsies, they are avoided as much as possible. Other investigations that may be performed in any of the symptoms mentioned above are computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, lumbar puncture, electroencephalography (EEG) and evoked potential (EP) studies. If the {{diagnosis of}} sarcoidosis is suspected, typical X-ray or CT appearances of the chest may make the diagnosis more likely; elevations in angiotensin-converting enzyme and calcium in the blood, too, make sarcoidosis more likely. In the past, the Kveim <b>test</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> to diagnose sarcoidosis. This now obsolete test had a high (85%) sensitivity, but required spleen tissue of a known sarcoidosis patient, an extract of which was injected into the skin of a suspected case.|$|E
500|$|David Wechsler, {{developer}} of the Wechsler–Bellevue Scale of 1939 (which was later developed into the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale) popularized {{the use of}} [...] "deviation IQs" [...] as standard scores of IQ tests rather than the [...] "quotient IQs" [...] ("mental age" [...] divided by [...] "chronological age") then used for the Stanford–Binet test. He devoted a whole chapter in his book The Measurement of Adult Intelligence {{to the topic of}} IQ classification and proposed different category names from those used by Lewis Terman. Wechsler also criticized the practice of earlier authors who published IQ classification tables without specifying which IQ <b>test</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> to obtain the scores reported in the tables.|$|E
50|$|The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory <b>test</b> (VDRL) <b>is</b> a blood <b>test</b> for {{syphilis}} {{that was}} developed by the eponymous lab.

50|$|The 6.5% salt broth <b>test</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> {{to analyze}} the {{tolerance}} level of various bacteria under halophilic conditions.  This <b>test</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> because most organisms cannot survive in high salt concentrations while Staphylococci, Enterococci, and Aerococci are all expected to tolerate 6.5% NaCl concentrations.|$|R
2500|$|An {{episode of}} MythBusters tested this legend {{and found that}} as little as three poppy-seed bagels was enough to cause a {{positive}} result {{for the remainder of}} the day they were eaten (though participants tested clean the following day). [...] The results of this experiment are inconclusive, however, because a <b>test</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> with an opiate cutoff level of 300ng/mL instead of the current SAMHSA recommended cutoff level used in the NIDA 5 test, which was raised from 300ng/mL to 2,000ng/mL in 1998 in order to avoid such false positives from poppy seeds.|$|E
2500|$|Rorschach never {{intended}} the inkblots {{to be used}} as a general personality test, but developed them as a tool for the diagnosis of [...] schizophrenia. It was not until 1939 that the <b>test</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> as a projective test of personality, a use of which Rorschach had always been skeptical. Interviewed in 2012 for a BBC Radio 4 documentary, Rita Signer, curator of the Rorschach Archives in Bern, Switzerland, suggested that far from being random or chance designs, each of the blots selected by Rorschach for his test had been meticulously designed to be as ambiguous and [...] "conflicted" [...] as possible.|$|E
2500|$|The Mantoux test or Mendel-Mantoux test (also {{known as}} the Mantoux {{screening}} test, tuberculin sensitivity test, Pirquet test, or PPD test for purified protein derivative) is a tool for screening for tuberculosis (TB) and for tuberculosis diagnosis. It {{is one of the}} major tuberculin skin tests used around the world, largely replacing multiple-puncture tests such as the tine test. The Heaf test, a form of tine <b>test,</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> until 2005 in the UK, when it was replaced by the Mantoux test. The Mantoux test is endorsed by the American Thoracic Society and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [...] It was also used in the USSR and is now prevalent in most of the post-Soviet states.|$|E

2500|$|The {{sentence}} {{for an individual}} found guilty of witchcraft or sorcery during this time, and in previous centuries, typically included either burning at the stake or being tested with the [...] "ordeal of cold water" [...] or judicium aquae frigidae. [...] The cold-water test was primarily a Western European phenomenon, but {{was used as a}} method of truth in Russia prior to, and post, seventeenth-century witchcraft trials in Muscovy. [...] Accused persons who submerged were considered innocent, and ecclesiastical authorities would proclaim them [...] "brought back," [...] but those who floated were considered guilty of practicing witchcraft, and burned at the stake or executed in an unholy fashion. The thirteenth-century bishop of Vladimir, Serapion Vladimirskii, preached sermons throughout the Muscovite countryside, and in one particular sermon revealed that burning was the usual punishment for witchcraft, but more often the cold water <b>test</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> as a precursor to execution.|$|E
2500|$|This {{interpretation}} of the Free Exercise Clause continued into the 1960s and the ascendancy of the Warren Court under chief justice Earl Warren. [...] Applying a new standard of [...] "strict scrutiny" [...] in various areas of civil rights law, the Court began to apply this standard to the First Amendment religion clauses as well, reading the Free Exercise Clause to require accommodation of religious conduct except where a state could show a compelling interest and no less burdensome means to achieve that end. [...] One example was Sherbert v. Verner, where the Court overturned the state Employment Security Commission's decision to deny unemployment benefits to a practicing member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church who was forced {{out of a job}} after her employer adopted a 6-day work week, which would have required her to work on Saturdays against the dictates of her religion. [...] As Justice William Brennan stated for the majority, [...] "to condition the availability of benefits upon this appellant's willingness to violate a cardinal principle of her religious faith effectively penalizes the free exercise of her constitutional liberties." [...] This <b>test</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> through the years of the Burger Court, including particularly in the landmark case of Wisconsin v. Yoder (1972).|$|E
