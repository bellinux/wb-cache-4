25|$|Most {{fluorescent}} lamps use electrodes that operate by <b>thermionic</b> <b>emission,</b> meaning they are operated {{at a high}} enough temperature for the electrode material (usually aided by a special coating) to emit electrons into the tube by heat.|$|E
25|$|Cold cathode lamps are {{generally}} less efficient than <b>thermionic</b> <b>emission</b> lamps because the cathode fall voltage is much higher. The increased fall voltage results in more power dissipation at tube ends, {{which does not}} contribute to light output. However, this is less significant with longer tubes. The increased power dissipation at tube ends also usually means cold cathode tubes have to be run at a lower loading than their <b>thermionic</b> <b>emission</b> equivalents. Given the higher tube voltage required anyway, these tubes can easily be made long, and even run as series strings. They are better suited for bending into special shapes for lettering and signage, and can also be instantly switched on or off.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} also tubes that operate in cold cathode mode, whereby {{electrons}} are liberated into the tube only by the large potential difference (voltage) between the electrodes. This {{does not mean the}} electrodes are cold (indeed, they can be very hot), but it does mean they are operating below their <b>thermionic</b> <b>emission</b> temperature. Because cold cathode lamps have no <b>thermionic</b> <b>emission</b> coating to wear out, they can have much longer lives than hot cathode tubes. This quality makes them desirable for maintenance-free long-life applications (such as backlights in liquid crystal displays). Sputtering of the electrode may still occur, but electrodes can be shaped (e.g. into an internal cylinder) to capture most of the sputtered material so it is not lost from the electrode.|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{inertial}} {{electrostatic confinement}} (IEC) fusion reactor designs utilize an ion accelerating grid fabricated {{out of a}} refractory metal capable of operating at high temperatures to radiate off heat imparted by ion-grid collisions. Unfortunately, the high gird temperature allows for a substantial <b>thermionic</b> electron <b>emission</b> current, requiring a high power draw and significantly reducing reactor efficiency. Further, electrons emitted from the grid are accelerated into the reactor shell where they generate {{a significant amount of}} bremsstrahlung x-rays requiring additional shielding and increasing system size and weight. Presented is a novel modification to the traditional implementation of an IEC fusion reactor, designed to improve operating efficiency by reducing electron emission from the grid. A liquid cooled grid design is utilized to reduce <b>thermionic</b> electron <b>emission,</b> allowing for higher plasma densities, and greater input power while improving system efficiency and reducing x-ray output.

25|$|Irving Langmuir at the General Electric {{research}} laboratory (Schenectady, New York) had improved Wolfgang Gaede's high-vacuum diffusion pump {{and used it}} to settle the question of <b>thermionic</b> <b>emission</b> and conduction in a vacuum. Consequently, General Electric started producing hard vacuum triodes (which were branded Pliotrons) in 1915. Langmuir patented the hard vacuum triode, but De Forest and AT successfully asserted priority and invalidated the patent.|$|E
25|$|When {{the light}} is turned on, the {{electric}} power heats up the cathode enough for it to emit electrons (<b>thermionic</b> <b>emission).</b> These electrons collide with and ionize noble gas atoms inside the bulb surrounding the filament to form a plasma {{by the process of}} impact ionization. As a result of avalanche ionization, the conductivity of the ionized gas rapidly rises, allowing higher currents to flow through the lamp.|$|E
50|$|Physical vapor {{deposition}} {{takes place}} in a vacuum and produces a thin film of solar cells by depositing thin layers of metals onto a backing structure. Electron-beam evaporation uses <b>thermionics</b> <b>emission</b> to create a stream of electrons that are accelerated by a high-voltage cathode and anode arrangement. Electrostatic and magnetic fields focus and direct the electrons to strike a target. The kinetic energy is transformed into thermal energy at or near the surface of the material. The resulting heating causes the material to melt and then evaporate. Temperatures in excess of 3500 degrees Celsius can be reached. The vapor from the source condenses onto a substrate, creating a thin film of high-purity material. Film thicknesses from a single atomic layer to many micrometers can be achieved. This technique is used in microelectronics, optics, and material research, and to produce solar cells and many other products.|$|R

25|$|Vacuum tubes mostly rely on <b>thermionic</b> <b>emission</b> of {{electrons}} from a hot filament or a cathode heated by the filament. This type {{is called a}} thermionic tube or thermionic valve. A phototube, however, achieves electron emission through the photoelectric effect. Not all electronic circuit valves/electron tubes are vacuum tubes (evacuated); gas-filled tubes are similar devices containing a gas, typically at low pressure, which exploit phenomena related to electric discharge in gases, usually without a heater.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent light {{fixtures}} cannot {{be connected to}} dimmer switches intended for incandescent lamps. Two effects are responsible for this: the waveform of the voltage emitted by a standard phase-control dimmer interacts badly with many ballasts, and it becomes difficult to sustain an arc in the fluorescent tube at low power levels. Dimming installations require a compatible dimming ballast. These systems keep the cathodes of the fluorescent tube fully heated even as the arc current is reduced, promoting easy <b>thermionic</b> <b>emission</b> of electrons into the arc stream. CFLs are available that work {{in conjunction with a}} suitable dimmer.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it resembles}} a vacuum tube in appearance, its {{operation}} {{does not depend}} on <b>thermionic</b> <b>emission</b> of electrons from a heated cathode. It is therefore called a cold-cathode tube (a form of gas-filled tube), and is a variant of the neon lamp. Such tubes rarely exceed 40°C (104°F) even under the most severe of operating conditions in a room at ambient temperature. Vacuum fluorescent displays from the same era use completely different technology—they have a heated cathode together with a control grid and shaped phosphor anodes; Nixies have no heater or control grid, typically a single anode (in the form of a wire mesh, {{not to be confused with}} a control grid), and shaped bare metal cathodes.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{continuum}} model {{based on}} a drift-diffusion approach is applied to describe the dynamics of electronic excitation, heating and charge-carrier transport in metals and dielectrics under near-infrared femtosecond laser irradiation. The dependence of laser-induced charging of the targets on laser fluence and pulse duration is investigated. Various aspects concerning the mechanism of Coulomb Explosion (CE) are discussed. The CE threshold {{as a function of}} pulse duration is evaluated numerically for dielectric materials (sapphire and ULE glass). A special attention is paid to studies of interconnection between the electron emission yield and surface charging dynamics. It has been found that in dielectrics the photoemission yield saturates with increasing laser fluence as a result of self-regulation of the free-electron population. By contrast in metals, due to effective supply of electrons to the charging zone on the target surface, electron emission becomes unwarrantably high for short laser pulses and high fluences. However, photo- and <b>thermionic</b> <b>emissions</b> can be suppressed by the generated electric field whose amplitude is a function of pulse duration and laser fluence. The question on self-consistency of electron emission and surface charging is analyzed with outlining further studies...|$|R

25|$|The semi-resonant start circuit {{was invented}} by Thorn Lighting for use with T12 {{fluorescent}} tubes. This method uses a double wound transformer and a capacitor. With no arc current, the transformer and capacitor resonate at line frequency and generate about twice the supply voltage across the tube, and a small electrode heating current. This tube voltage is too low to strike the arc with cold electrodes, but as the electrodes heat up to <b>thermionic</b> <b>emission</b> temperature, the tube striking voltage falls below that of the ringing voltage, and the arc strikes. As the electrodes heat, the lamp slowly, over three to five seconds, reaches full brightness. As the arc current increases and tube voltage drops, the circuit provides current limiting.|$|E
25|$|This {{equation}} {{shows that}} in order to achieve sufficient current density it is necessary to heat the emitter, taking care not to cause damage by application of excessive heat. For this reason materials with either a high melting point, such as tungsten, or those with a low work function (LaB6) are required for the gun filament. Furthermore, both lanthanum hexaboride and tungsten thermionic sources must be heated in order to achieve <b>thermionic</b> <b>emission,</b> this can be achieved by the use of a small resistive strip. To prevent thermal shock, there is often a delay enforced in the application of current to the tip, to prevent thermal gradients from damaging the filament, the delay is usually a few seconds for LaB6, and significantly lower for tungsten.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>thermionic</b> <b>emission</b> was {{originally}} reported in 1873 by Frederick Guthrie, it was Thomas Edison's apparently independent {{discovery of the}} phenomenon in 1883 that became well known. Although Edison {{was aware of the}} unidirectional property of current flow between the filament and the anode, his interest (and patent) concentrated on the sensitivity of the anode current to the current through the filament (and thus filament temperature). Little practical use was ever made of this property (however early radios often implemented volume controls through varying the filament current of amplifying tubes). It was only years later that John Ambrose Fleming utilized the rectifying property of the diode tube to detect (demodulate) radio signals, a substantial improvement on the early cat's-whisker detector already used for rectification.|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of plasma rocket engine, the Kabila rocket, using a {{radioisotope}} heated thermionic heating chamber instead of a conventional combustion chamber or catalyst bed is introduced and it achieves specific impulses {{similar to the ones}} of conventional solid and bipropellant rockets. Curium- 244 is chosen as a radioisotope heat source and a thermal reductive layer is also used to obtain precise <b>thermionic</b> <b>emissions.</b> The self-sufficiency principle is applied by simultaneously heating up the emitting material with the radioisotope decay heat and by powering the different valves of the plasma rocket engine with the same radioisotope decay heat using a radioisotope thermoelectric generator. This rocket engine is then benchmarked against a 1  N hydrazine thruster configuration operated on one of the Pleiades-HR- 1 constellation spacecraft. A maximal specific impulse and power saving of respectively 529  s and 32 % are achieved with helium as propellant. Its advantages are its power saving capability, high specific impulses and simultaneous ease of storage and restart. It can however be extremely voluminous and potentially hazardous.

However, magnetrons are relatively low-power devices. The ability to synchronize multiple magnetrons to achieve higher total power output would increase the usefulness of magnetrons. It is impossible for most current magnetrons to achieve this ability because they use <b>thermionic</b> <b>emissions,</b> which is the emission of electrons by heating up a central cathode filament. That method is chaotic and unstable. Our solution is using gated field emission to inject electrons directly into the magnetron 2 ̆ 7 s interaction space. This research explores the hypothesis that a phase-controllable magnetron system, which could be used in a magnetron array, can be created using gated field emission devices modulated at the correct frequency.

25|$|In a {{conventional}} lamp, the evaporated tungsten eventually condenses {{on the inner}} surface of the glass envelope, darkening it. For bulbs that contain a vacuum, the darkening is uniform across the entire surface of the envelope. When a filling of inert gas is used, the evaporated tungsten is carried in the thermal convection currents of the gas, depositing preferentially on the uppermost part of the envelope and blackening just {{that portion of the}} envelope. An incandescent lamp that gives 93% or less of its initial light output at 75% of its rated life is regarded as unsatisfactory, when tested according to IEC Publication 60064. Light loss is due to filament evaporation and bulb blackening. Study of the problem of bulb blackening led to the discovery of the Edison effect, <b>thermionic</b> <b>emission</b> and invention of the vacuum tube.|$|E
25|$|When {{power is}} first {{applied to the}} circuit, {{there will be a}} glow {{discharge}} across the electrodes in the starter lamp. This heats the gas in the starter and causes one of the bi-metallic contacts to bend towards the other. When the contacts touch, the two filaments of the fluorescent lamp and the ballast will effectively be switched in series to the supply voltage. The current through the filaments causes them to heat up and emit electrons into the tube gas by <b>thermionic</b> <b>emission.</b> In the starter, the touching contacts short out the voltage sustaining the glow discharge, extinguishing it so the gas cools down and no longer heats the bi-metallic switch, which opens within a second or two. The current through the filaments and the inductive ballast is abruptly interrupted, leaving the full line voltage applied between the filaments at the ends of the tube and generating an inductive kick which provides the high voltage needed to start the lamp. The lamp will fail to strike if the filaments are not hot enough, in which case the cycle repeats; several cycles are usually needed, which causes flickering and clicking during starting (older thermal starters behaved better in this respect). A power factor correction (PFC) capacitor draws leading current from the mains to compensate for the lagging current drawn by the lamp circuit.|$|E

These InGaP barrier layers are effective at reducing diode dark current, and photogenerated carrier escape is maximized by the proper design of the electric field and barrier profile. With the new material, open-circuit voltage enhancements of 40 and 100 mV (versus PIN control systems) are possible without any degradation in short-circuit current. Basic tenets of quantum-well and quantum- dot solar cells are utilized, but instead of using multiple thin layers, a single wide well works better. InGaP is used as a barrier material, which increases open current, while simultaneously lowering dark current, reducing both hole diffusion from the base, and space charge recombination within the depletion region.

The operation of these detectors is enabled by the <b>thermionic</b> <b>emissions</b> from the GLs enhanced by the electrons heated by incoming THz radiation. The electron heating is primarily associated with the intraband absorption (the Drude absorption). We calculate the responsivity and detectivity as functions of the photon energy, GL doping, and the applied voltage for the GL detectors (GLDs) with different number of GLs. The detectors based on the cascade multiple-GL structures can exhibit a substantial photoelectric gain resulting in the elevated responsivity and detectivity. The advantages of the THz detectors under consideration are associated with their high sensitivity to the normal incident radiation and efficient operation at room temperature {{at the low end of}} the THz frequency range. Such GLDs with a metal grating, supporting the excitation of plasma oscillations in the GL-structures by the incident THz radiation, can exhibit a strong resonant response at the frequencies of several THz (in the range, where the operation of the conventional detectors based on A$_ 3 $B$_ 5 $ materials, in particular THz quantum-well detectors, is hindered due to a strong optical phonon radiation absorption in such materials).
