5|$|The Hampden Roar {{was first}} noticed {{in a game}} against England in 1929. Scotland, who had played the second half with ten players due to an injury to Alex Jackson, {{equalised}} in the final minute with a goal from Alec Cheyne direct from a corner kick. The roar that followed the goal was so loud that Jackson, who was a mile away in the Glasgow Victoria Infirmary, could <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> Scotland had scored.|$|E
5|$|The Harivamsa {{from the}} epic Mahabharata also narrates the {{incident}} {{in a similar fashion}} complete with Narada's praise identifying Krishna as Vishnu. The Vishnu Purana and the Harivamsa (1st - 2nd century BCE) <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> Keshi is the last agent sent by Kamsa to kill Krishna, after Keshi's killing, Krishna and Balarama go to Mathura, where Kamsa is killed. However, the Bhagavata Purana describes the killing of the demon Vyoma sent by Kamsa, before he leaves for Mathura.|$|E

Local stories <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> Colonel Birch's niece, Alice Birch, {{fell in love with}} a {{handsome}} Royalist, Charles Clifford; according to these stories the two attempted to escape before the final assault but died in a flash flood while trying to cross the River Wye, and live on as ghosts on the site.|$|E

5|$|In the Ramayana, the Linga Purana and the Mahabharata, Ila {{grows to}} become the king of Bahlika. While hunting in a forest, Ila accidentally trespassed Sharavana ("Forest of Reeds"), the sacred grove of the goddess Parvati, the consort of the god Shiva. Upon {{entering}} Sharavana, all male beings except for Shiva, including trees and animals, are transformed into females. In the Ramayana, even Shiva had assumed {{the form of a}} female to please the goddess. One legend tells that a female yakshini disguised herself as a deer and purposefully led Ila to the grove in order to save her husband from the king. The Linga Purana and the Mahabharata emphasize the sex change of Ila to be a deliberate act of Shiva to start the Lunar dynasty. The Bhagavata Purana et al. texts <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> Ila's entire entourage as well as his horse also changed their genders.|$|E
5|$|Malhari Mahatmya {{states that}} Khandoba first {{appeared}} on Champashasti, which was a Sunday, at Premapur, which identified as Pember (Adimailar, Mailarapur) near Bidar. Marathi traditions <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> Khandoba came originally from Premapuri, now Pember in Karnataka, then went to Naldurg, Pali and finally to Jejuri. Sontheimer suggests that the cult of Mailara may have originated in Pember and then spread to Maharashtra, merging with the cult of Khandaka— the patron yaksha (demi-god) of Paithan giving it its distinct Maharashtrain characteristics. Maharashtrains call the god - Kanadya Khanderaya, the god from Karnataka. The cult possibly was spread by Lingayat, Jain and other merchants, associated with Mailara-Khandoba, {{to other parts of}} the Deccan. Besides Mailara, Khandoba is identified with other deities of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, and is called as Mallanna, Mairala, and Mallu Khan. Other traditions like Shakta cults of folk goddesses were assimilated into the Khandoba cult, identifying the goddesses with Khandoba's wives Mhalsa or Banai.|$|E
25|$|Uttama Chola reigned 970-85. Inscriptions <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> {{at least}} from his time, Chola warriors wore waist coats of armour. Hence, one {{regiment}} was called Niyayam-Uttama-Chola-tterinda-andalakattalar. Paluvettaraiyar Maravan Kandanar served as a general under Uttama and his predecessor, Sundara.|$|E

The Skjöldunga saga, in Arngrímur Jónsson's abstract, chapter 3, <b>tells</b> <b>that</b> Hrōðgār (Roas) married {{the daughter of an}} English king. The Hrolfs saga kraka, chapter 5, <b>tells</b> <b>that</b> Hrōðgār (Hróarr) married Ögn who was the daughter of a king of Northumbria (Norðhymbraland) called Norðri.|$|R

25|$|The expansionist King Bimbisara conquered Anga {{in what is}} now West Bengal and {{strengthened}} the military of Magadh's capital, Rajagriha. Ajatashatru built a new fort at Pataliputra, Magadh's new capital, to launch an attack on Licchavis across the Ganges River. Jain texts <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> he used two new weapons, a catapult and a covered chariot with swinging mace that has been compared to modern tanks.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} a {{continuing}} misrepresentation, lying by omission occurs when an important fact is left out in order to foster a misconception. Lying by omission includes the failure to correct pre-existing misconceptions. For example, when the seller of a car declares it has been serviced regularly but does not <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> a fault was reported at the last service, the seller lies by omission. It {{can be compared to}} dissimulation.|$|E

25|$|The Chronicon Lethrense and the {{included}} Annales Lundenses report that Ro and Helghe were {{the sons of}} Haldan, who died of old age. The two brothers shared the rule, Ro taking the land and Helghe the water.

However, before Ro's nephew Rolf Krage (Hroðulf), who was Helghe's son by his own daughter Yrse, could ascend the throne, the rule of Denmark was given to a dog, on the orders of the Swedish king Hakon/Athisl (that is, Eadgils).|$|E
25|$|Treatment for {{meconium}} impaction typically {{involves the}} use of enemas, although persistent cases may require mineral oil or IV fluids. It is possible to <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> the meconium has passed when the foal begins to produce a softer, more yellow manure. Although meconium impactions rarely cause perforation, and are usually not life-threatening, foals are at risk of dehydration and may not get adequate levels of IgG due to decreased suckling and not enough ingestion of colostrum. Additionally, the foals will eventually bloat, and will require surgical intervention. Surgery in a foal can be especially risky due to immature immune system and low levels of ingested colostrum.|$|E
25|$|Ancient exegetes, {{such as the}} Midrash and the Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan, <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> {{the motive}} {{involved}} a desire for the most beautiful woman. According to Midrashic tradition, Cain and Abel each had twin sisters; each was to marry the other's. The Midrash states that Abel's promised wife, Aclima, was more beautiful. Since Cain would not consent to this arrangement, Adam suggested seeking God's blessing {{by means of a}} sacrifice. Whoever God blessed would marry Aclima. When God openly rejected Cain's sacrifice, Cain slew his brother in a fit of jealousy and anger. Analysts have described Cain's relationship to his sister as being incestuous.|$|E

25|$|The Chronicon Lethrense and the {{included}} Annales Lundenses <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> Haldan (Healfdene) had two sons, Helghe (Halga) and Ro (Hroðgar). When Haldan died of old age, Helghe and Ro divided the kingdom so that Ro ruled the land, and Helghe the sea. One day, Helghe arrived in Halland/Lolland and slept with Thore, {{the daughter of}} one of Ro's farmers. This resulted in a daughter named Yrse. Much later, he met Yrse, and without knowing that she was his daughter, he made her pregnant with Rolf. Eventually, Helghe found out that Yrse was his own daughter and, out of shame, went east and killed himself.|$|E

25|$|One of Caragiale's {{main and}} {{earliest}} types {{is that of}} the young man gripped by love, expressing himself through emphatic and Romantic clichés—its main representative is O noapte furtunoasăs Rică Venturiano. As Vianu commented, Caragiale exploited the theme to so much success that it took another generation for youthful love to be presented in a non-comedic context (with the common signature writings of Ştefan Octavian Iosif and Dimitrie Anghel). At the other end are patriarchal figures, heads of families who seem unable or unwilling to investigate their wives' adulterous relations with younger men. This behavior is notably present in O noapte furtunoasă, where the aged Dumitrache fails to note even the most obvious signs that his wife Veta is in love with his good friend Chiriac. A more complex situation is present in O scrisoare pierdută, where political boss Trahanache cannot <b>tell</b> <b>that</b> his wife Joiţica is having an affair with Tipătescu, and, when confronted with the evidence, is more interested in proving that she is not.|$|E
