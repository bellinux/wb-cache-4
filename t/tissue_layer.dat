5|$|Exipulum is a {{term used}} to refer to the tissue or tissues {{containing}} the hymenium of an ascomycete fruit body. The ectal excipulum (outer <b>tissue</b> <b>layer)</b> is thin (20–30µm thickness), made of a tissue type known as texura porrecta, consisting of more or less parallel hyphae all in one direction, with wide lumina and non-thickened walls. The medullary exipulum (middle <b>tissue</b> <b>layer)</b> is thick (200–600µm) and made of textura intricata, a <b>tissue</b> <b>layer</b> made of irregularly interwoven hyphae with distinct spaces between the hyphae. The asci (filamentous structures in which the ascospores develop) are cylindrical with gradually tapering bases, eight-spored, and measure 240–280 by 12–15µm. The ascospores have ellipsoidal to roughly cylindrical shapes, usually with blunt ends, and measure 19–22 by 10–12µm. They have smooth surfaces and usually contain two large oil drops. The paraphyses (sterile, filamentous hyphae present in the hymenium) are cylindrical, 2–3µm thick, barely enlarged at their apices, straight, and mostly unbranched above. They may sometimes anastomose, but do not form a conspicuous network. The paraphyses contain numerous red granules.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies, or apothecia, of Banksiamyces {{species are}} {{cup-shaped}} receptacles borne on a stipe (stalk), colored dark brown to black {{with a dark}} grey center. When dry, the apothecia are covered with a whitish powder. The edges of the cup may be rolled inwards (especially when dry), or be twisted and somewhat flattened. Both the outermost <b>tissue</b> <b>layer</b> (the ectal excipulum) and the tissue of the stalk are made of fungal cells with brown pigments that can be variously thick- or thin-walled, covered with small particles (granules), and spherical to ellipsoid. The middle <b>tissue</b> <b>layer</b> (the medullary excipulum) of both the cup and the internal <b>tissue</b> <b>layer</b> (the medulla) of the stalk contain a layer of tissue made of hyphae similar to the ectal excipulum. A second layer of tissue is made of hyphae that are translucent and gelatinous; this layer may be present in either the medullary excipulum, the medulla, or both.|$|E
5|$|In ascomycetes, dikaryotic hyphae of the {{hymenium}} (the spore-bearing <b>tissue</b> <b>layer)</b> form {{a characteristic}} hook at the hyphal septum. During cell division, {{formation of the}} hook ensures proper distribution of the newly divided nuclei into the apical and basal hyphal compartments. An ascus (plural asci) is then formed, in which karyogamy (nuclear fusion) occurs. Asci are embedded in an ascocarp, or fruiting body. Karyogamy in the asci is followed immediately by meiosis {{and the production of}} ascospores. After dispersal, the ascospores may germinate and form a new haploid mycelium.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tissue</b> <b>layers</b> {{formed from}} the {{primitive}} streak invaginate together into the embryo and the induced mesenchymal stem cells will ingress and form the mesoderm.

5|$|In the past, {{the species}} (when {{it was known}} as Calvatia utriformis) has been {{separated}} into three varieties (C.utriformis var. utriformis, C.utriformis var. hungarica and C.utriformis var. gruberi) based on differences in the ornamentation of the exoperidium (outer <b>tissue</b> <b>layer</b> of the wall, or peridium) and spores. However, a 1997 study of these characters revealed that the three varieties are not clearly demarcated. This study and others suggest that variations in the environmental conditions in which the specimens are grown can affect {{the development of these}} characteristics.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} L.incarnatum are tiny, oval to roughly spherical, and measure 35–1250 by 200–450μm. The {{floating}} balls are sometimes enclosed {{in a loose}} subiculum, with a whitish surface that is byssoid (consisting of fine threads). The peridium (the outer protective <b>tissue</b> <b>layer)</b> is 18–30μm thick, byssoid, and made of clamped hyphae typically 2.5–4μm in diameter intertwined with dendrophyses (irregularly branched cystidia) 1μm in diameter. The surface of the peridium is hydrophobic, a feature that helps keep water off the growing hymenium during its development, and gives the fruit body buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{ellipsoid}} {{and measure}} 12–14.5 by 6.5–8μm. They have a brownish-yellow wall greater than 1μm thick {{and a broad}} apical germ pore with an acute hilar appendix at the base (a region where the spore was once attached to the sterigma). The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are four-spored, hyaline (translucent), and measure 32–44 by 8–12μm. The cap cuticle is made of a layer 130–150μm thick, with hyaline, thin-walled gelatinized hyphae measuring 1.5–4μm broad. The hypodermium (the <b>tissue</b> <b>layer</b> directly under the pileipellis) is made of thin-walled, hyaline hyphae, 2.5–8μm broad, with a brownish incrusting pigment. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{complexity}} of temporoparietal anatomy {{is compounded by}} inconsistent nomenclature. OBJECTIVE: To provide {{a comprehensive review of}} the variations in terminology and anatomic descriptions of the temporoparietal soft <b>tissue</b> <b>layers,</b> with the aim of improving learning and communication across surgical disciplines. METHODS: MEDLINE (1950 - 2009) searches were conducted for anatomic studies of the temporoparietal region, and for studies describing temporoparietal anatomy in the context of surgical techniques. RESULTS: Sixty-nine articles were included in the review. Naming of the soft <b>tissue</b> <b>layers</b> of the temporoparietal region was inconsistent both within and across surgical disciplines, with several terms utilized for the same layer and occasionally the same term applied to different layers. Studies also varied in their description of the vascular, neural, and soft tissue architecture of the temporoparietal region. CONCLUSION: A uniform, descriptive nomenclature is paramount to facilitating surgical education and interpreting future studies. A naming system based on the Terminologica Anatomica is proposed in this review. From superficial to deep, the proposed terms for the soft <b>tissue</b> <b>layers</b> of the temporoparietal region include: temporoparietal fascia, loose areolar tissue plane, superficial leaflet of temporal fascia, fat pad of temporal fascia, deep leaflet of temporal fascia, fat pad deep to temporal fascia, temporalis or temporal muscle, and pericraniu...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of near {{electric}} and magnetic field magnitudes and pattern in <b>tissue</b> <b>layers</b> due to exposure from a dipole antenna would normally require extensive electromagnetic computation, with significant computing resource and time. In this paper, {{the authors have}} developed an analytical approach to provide a fast, intuitive estimate of near field exposure by direct closed-form formulae, without the need of integration by numerical computation. A computational tool based on the proposed approach has been developed in MATLAB&# 0174; to estimate near field exposure of various points of different <b>tissue</b> <b>layers</b> adjacent to a dipole operating in 900 MHz frequency. Results of this approach were obtained with significantly lower computational time when compared against those computed with a commercial Maxwell&# 8217;s equations solver FEKO&# 0174;. Empirically-derived correction factors are introduced to adjust for the assumptions required in developing direct closed-form formulae. We found that the {{root mean square error}} in using the analytical formulae is less than 16. 5 % for considered scenarios, where we represent <b>tissue</b> <b>layers</b> with dielectric layers. The approach developed here is used to observe near fields at closer distance in comparison to previous literature, is capable to investigate fields at continuous resolution without requiring more computational resource, and has reconciled some discordant results in the literature...|$|R
40|$|Although {{low-level}} {{laser therapy}} (LLLT) {{has been a}} valuable therapeutic technology in the clinic, its efficacy may be reduced in deep <b>tissue</b> <b>layers</b> due to strong light scattering which limits the photon density. In order to enhance the photon density in deep <b>tissue</b> <b>layers,</b> this study developed an optical tissue clearing (OTC) laser probe (OTCLP) system which can utilize four different OTC methods: 1) tissue temperature control from 40 to 10 ℃; 2) laser pulse frequency from 5 to 30 Hz; 3) glycerol injection at a local region; and 4) {{a combination of the}} aforementioned three methods. The efficacy of the OTC methods was evaluated and compared by investigating laser beam profiles in ex-vivo porcine skin samples. Results demonstrated that total (peak) intensity at full width at half maximum of laser beam profile when compared to control data was increased: 1) 1. 21 (1. 39) -fold at 10 ℃; 2) 1. 22 (1. 49) -fold at a laser pulse frequency of 5 Hz; 3) 1. 64 (2. 41) -fold with 95 % glycerol injection; 4) 1. 86 (3. 4) -fold with the combination method. In conclusion, the OTCLP system successfully improved the laser photon density in deep <b>tissue</b> <b>layers</b> and may be utilized as a useful tool in LLLT by increasing laser photon density...|$|R
5|$|The subhymenium (a {{layer of}} cells {{immediately}} below the hymenium) consists of spherical {{cells that are}} interwoven with hyphae; this layer is hyaline to yellowish or brownish, and does not have pigment crusted {{on the walls of}} the hyphae. The epicutis (the upper of two layers of the cap cuticle) is made of a thin gelatinous layer of hyaline or brownish hyphae measuring 1.5–2.5μm in diameter. The hypodermium (the cuticle <b>tissue</b> <b>layer</b> under the epicutis) is hyaline, and has elongated to roughly spherical hyphae that are 10–18μm in diameter. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of P.aztecorum.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} are white. Spores are cylindrical, smooth, hyaline (translucent), inamyloid, and measure 9–12 by 3–3.5µm. Pycnoporellus alboluteus has a monomitic hyphal system, meaning {{it is made}} of {{generative}} hyphae, which are thin-walled, branched, and narrow. Hyphae in the flesh layer are thin- to thick-walled, frequently branched, and measure 2–10µm in diameter, while those of the pores are roughly similar in morphology, but measure 3–5µm. Both forms have a thin incrustation on their walls that gives them a rough appearance when viewed with a light microscope. The hymenium (spore-bearing <b>tissue</b> <b>layer)</b> is 40–60µm thick, and has abundant cystidia, which are hyaline, and measure 7–9µm in diameter.

The cheilocystidia, which measure 32–46 by 8–14μm, are tapered on either end and can have two to several obtuse fingerlike projections {{arising from the}} apex. The gill flesh stains vinaceous-brown in iodine. The subhymenium (the <b>tissue</b> <b>layer</b> directly underneath the hymenium) is made of narrow, interwoven hyphae, with the central portion composed of long, cylindrical, and moderately broad cells.
