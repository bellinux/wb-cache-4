5|$|At present, it is {{not clear}} what {{evidence}} the President may rely on to be satisfied that the Prime Minister has ceased to command <b>the</b> <b>confidence</b> of a majority of MPs, as the Singapore courts have not yet had to decide the issue. In the Sarawak case of Stephen Kalong Ningkan v. Tun Abang Haji Openg, decided on provisions similar to those in the Singapore Constitution, the court found that the phrase ceased to command <b>the</b> <b>confidence</b> of a majority of the Members of Parliament was a term of art which had to be signified by a formal vote of no confidence taken by the legislature. In contrast, a Sabah court held in Datuk Amir Kahar v. Tun Mohd Said bin Keruak, Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sabah that loss of confidence could be assessed on the basis of evidence other than a legislative vote. This might include, for instance, media reports or letters addressed to the President.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies on}} {{macroeconomic}} effects of oil price changes and of oil price uncertainty have mainly focused on real economic outcomes, such as employment, consumption and aggregate output. This paper investigates {{the links between}} the oil price changes and <b>the</b> consumer <b>confidence</b> in Canada, at both the national and the regional levels, using the correlation analysis and least square econometric methods. The results of this paper suggest the oil price declines mainly affect <b>the</b> consumer <b>confidence</b> about <b>the</b> overall employment and about the overall buying conditions of durable goods. More specifically, the oil price declines have negative impacts on <b>the</b> consumer <b>confidence</b> about <b>the</b> overall employment in Canada. However, the impacts on <b>the</b> consumer <b>confidence</b> about <b>the</b> overall buying conditions of durable goods differ in the oil-producing regions and the oil-consuming regions. For the minority of the regions in Canada, the oil price changes affect <b>the</b> consumer <b>confidence</b> about <b>the</b> household financial positions. In addition, several oil price transformations are examined in this paper. The introduction of the asymmetric oil price changes reveals that the oil price declines are more important in affecting <b>the</b> consumer <b>confidence</b> about <b>the</b> employment expectation than the oil price rises. Although different levels of the oil price volatility might not affect <b>the</b> consumer <b>confidence,</b> <b>the</b> higher is the oil price volatility, the more sensitive is <b>the</b> consumer <b>confidence</b> to <b>the</b> oil price changes of the same size...|$|R

He inspired his men—Wellington said his presence on the battlefield was worth 40,000 soldiers, for he inspired confidence from privates to field marshals. He also unnerved the enemy. At the Battle of Auerstadt in 1806, King Frederick William III of Prussia outnumbered the French by 63,000 to 27,000; however, when he was told, mistakenly, that Napoleon was in command, he ordered a hasty retreat that turned into a rout.

40|$|This thesis assesses <b>the</b> {{usefulness}} of <b>confidence</b> indicators for short term forecasting {{of the economic}} activity in the Czech Republic. The predictive power of both <b>the</b> business <b>confidence</b> indicator and <b>the</b> customer <b>confidence</b> indicator is examined using two empirical approaches. First we predict the likelihood of economic downturn defined as a discrete event using logit models, later we estimate GDP growth out of sample forecasts {{in the framework of}} vector autoregression models. The results obtained from the downturn probability models confirm <b>the</b> ability of <b>confidence</b> indicators (especially <b>the</b> business <b>confidence</b> indicator) to estimate the current economic situation and to anticipate economic downturn one quarter ahead. Results from the out-of-sample GDP growth value forecasting are ambiguous. Nevertheless <b>the</b> customer <b>confidence</b> indicator significantly improved original forecasts based on a model with standard macroeconomic variables and therefore we conclude in favour of its predictive power. This result was indirectly confirmed by OECD as <b>the</b> Czech customer <b>confidence</b> indicator has been included as a new component in the OECD domestic composite leading indicator since April 2012...|$|R

We present our recent work on using a novel maximum entropy model with distribution constraints to calibrate <b>the</b> semantic <b>confidence</b> scores with <b>the</b> inputs of only <b>the</b> raw semantic <b>confidence</b> and <b>the</b> associated raw word confidence scores.
