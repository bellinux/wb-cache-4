500|$|In 1982, {{an investigative}} {{reporter}} named Gary Moore from the St. Petersburg Times drove from the Tampa area to Cedar Key looking for a story. When he commented to a local on the [...] "gloomy atmosphere" [...] of Cedar Key, and questioned why a Southern town was all-white when {{at the start of}} the 20th century it had been nearly half black, the local woman replied, [...] "I know what you're digging for. You're <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> talk about that massacre." [...] Moore was hooked. He was able to convince Arnett Doctor to join him on a visit to the site, which he did without telling his mother. Moore addressed the disappearance of the incident from written or spoken history: [...] "After a week of sensation, the weeks of January 1923 seem to have dropped completely from Florida's consciousness, like some unmentionable skeleton in the family closet".|$|E
2500|$|Walter Pincus, a Washington Post columnist, has {{reported}} that he was told in confidence by an unnamed Bush administration official on July 12, 2003, two days before Novak's column appeared, that [...] "the White House had not paid attention to former Ambassador Joseph Wilson's CIA-sponsored February 2002 trip to Niger because it was set up as a boondoggle by his wife, {{an analyst with the}} agency working on weapons of mass destruction." [...] Because he did not believe it to be true, Pincus claims, he did not report the story in The Washington Post until October 12, 2003: [...] "I wrote my October story because I did not think the person who spoke to me was committing a criminal act, but only practicing damage control by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stop writing about Wilson. Because of that article, The Washington Post and I received subpoenas last summer from Patrick J. Fitzgerald." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{commentators}} {{have said that}} the harassment associated with Gamergate springs from this existing well of deep-seated misogyny, and that it was merely brought to the fore by the anonymity of the Internet. Regarding the false allegations against Quinn, Amanda Marcotte in an article for The Daily Beast accused the video game world of being [...] "thick with misogynists who are aching to swarm" [...] with hate on any [...] "random woman held up for them to hate, no matter what the pretext". She related these attacks to harassment sent to a woman who criticized a Teen Titans cover and to a community manager of the Mighty No. 9 game because she drew a feminine Mega Man, and virtual rapes committed against women's player avatars in Grand Theft Auto V and DayZ. In an interview with the BBC, Quinn stated that [...] "Before [...] had a name, it was nothing but <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> kill myself, trying to get people to hurt me, going after my family. ... There is no mention of ethics in journalism at all outside of making the same accusation everybody makes towards any successful woman; that clearly she got to where she is because she had sex with someone." [...] Danielle Citron of the University of Maryland wrote that the intent of this type of harassment is to demean the victim, make them doubt their own integrity, and to redefine the victim's identity in order to [...] "fundamentally distort who she is".|$|E

"That's it," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Nott thoughtfully, plucking at his bushy whiskers {{with his}} fingers and thumb {{as if he were}} removing dead and sapless incumbrances in their growth, [...] "that's just what it is--them's ez in it themselves don't pay, and them ez haz left their goods--the goods don't pay.

That foolishness ez all he's good for. And yet thar might be suthin' in the paint, if a feller had nigger luck.

5000|$|Tom Lea of Fact {{commented on}} the album in 2015 that the album [...] "divided listeners". Whyte tweeted that he felt the Green Language was [...] "too A&Red", later {{explaining}} that his managers were [...] "trying to push me in one way, in kind of an avant garde, arty route, then I had other people <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do big singles, the vocal stuff and all that.

5000|$|On March 12, 2001, then Gold Age owner Parker Bradley was {{detained}} {{at his place}} of business in Syracuse, New York by US Secret Service agents investigating credit card fraud. Bradley claimed he has stopped accepting credit cards in 2000 due to too many people used stolen credit cards when conducting business with him. [...] "The interrogation became less about me and more about politics and e-gold," [...] Bradley said. [...] "They were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> blame e-gold for fraud.

5000|$|On 26 September 2006, in an {{interview}} on Fox News with Chris Wallace, former President Bill Clinton gave his version of events surrounding the mission in Somalia. Clinton defended his exit strategy for U.S. forces and denied that the departure was premature. He said conservative Republicans had pushed him to leave the region before the operation's objectives could be achieved: [...] "...Republicans were all <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> withdraw from Somalia in 1993 the next day after we were involved in 'Black Hawk down,' and I refused to do it and stayed six months and had an orderly transfer to the United Nations." ...|$|E

They were working to a tight deadline for the programme {{but in the end}} the pressure became too much and the programme was delayed with the BBC’s agreement. Jayne took a two-week break with her just-married husband Phil Christensen before returning to start work with Chris on Oscar Tango. Iceworks was later completed for transmission as part of Omnibus in 1991, and achieved the highest viewing figures ever for the programme.|$|E

5000|$|The Snowden Files was {{initially}} criticised by Snowden associate, journalist Glenn Greenwald, {{when he had}} only read extracts from Harding's book. Later, after reading the whole book, he conceded {{that it did not}} criticise Snowden. On February 14, 2014 Greenwald told the Financial Times: [...] "They are purporting to tell the inside story of Edward Snowden but it is written by someone who has never met or even spoken to Edward Snowden.

At the time, (manager) Bernie Finkelstein kept <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> record the song, and I told him I was going to save it for the last album. After a while it just kind of disappeared. When we started to record this album I thought it’d be cool to bring back 'Gifts' but not tell Bernie. I also felt that at this point you never know ... I’m not getting any younger. So maybe there will be another album or maybe there won’t. It’s not a prediction of any kind. I just thought it was time to get it on record."
