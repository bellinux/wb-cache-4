5|$|<b>The</b> <b>airport</b> {{is located}} next to European Road E6.

5|$|A {{branch to}} Sola has been {{considered}} to allow the trains to operate to Sola and <b>the</b> <b>airport.</b> The line would branch from the Sørland Line south of Gausel, and be built so trains from the branch could run both northwards and southwards. Proposed stations include <b>the</b> <b>airport,</b> Solakrossen, Forus West, Statoil's head office and possibly the shopping center Kvadrat. This would give a travel time of 17 minutes from <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> to the city center, and 10 minutes from <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> to Sandnes. This route has, however, also been proposed {{as part of the}} light rail system. It would give about 2.5 million annual passengers.|$|E
5|$|All {{services}} from <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> are operated by Widerøe with 39-seat Dash-8-100 aircraft.

5|$|All taxi cabs in Iloilo may {{be hired}} {{to get from}} <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> to Iloilo City Proper or vice versa.

5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> {{is capable}} of {{handling}} Boeing 767 aircraft, for large numbers of these aircraft, significant investment would be needed. Consequently, the largest aircraft regularly flying to <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> are Boeing 757. The main problem at <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> {{is the lack of}} ramp space, with just two parking positions for large aircraft. As a result, El Al operates regular shuttle flights to Ben Gurion International Airport carrying passengers from around the world on 757s and 737s.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>airport,</b> Jai is {{overwhelmed}} with guilt and asks Sahil to leave, {{to which he}} protests.

As he is walking away into <b>the</b> <b>airport,</b> Jai sends a text message to Sahil saying that he loves him. Alex arrives at <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> to pick Sahil up, much to his surprise.

5|$|Now {{returning}} to its pre-Kensington route, NY33 follows a six-lane, divided Genesee Street past <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> {{on one side}} and numerous associated businesses such as hotels and fast food restaurants on the other.

5|$|On 12 April 1990, Widerøe Flight 839 crashed {{one minute}} after take-off, killing all five on board. The {{cause of the}} {{accident}} was the turbulence and high wind speeds around <b>the</b> <b>airport.</b> <b>The</b> <b>airport</b> was immediately closed after the incident; no public flights have taken off from <b>the</b> <b>Airport</b> after Flight 839. Private flights still use <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> on occasion.

This made Værøy Airport the civilian airport in Europe to have operated the shortest time. Helikopter Service resumed helicopter flights from Hanna Bakken-jorden on 1 January 1993. Construction of a new heliport started in 1996 and Værøy Heliport opened on 15 February 1997.
