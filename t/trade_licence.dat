2500|$|Soon rumblings {{appeared}} amongst {{merchants in}} London that the monopoly {{granted to the}} East India Company in 1600, intended to facilitate its competition against Dutch and French in a distant region, was no longer needed. In response, in the Charter Act of 1813, the British Parliament renewed the Company's charter but terminated its monopoly except with regard to tea and trade with China, opening India both to private investment and missionaries. With increased British power in India, supervision of Indian affairs by the British Crown and Parliament increased as well. By 1820s British nationals could transact business or engage in missionary work {{under the protection of}} the Crown in the three presidencies. Finally, under the terms of The Charter Act of 1833, the British Parliament revoked the Company's <b>trade</b> <b>licence</b> altogether. This made the Company a part of British governance, but administration of British India remained the responsibility Company officers. The Charter Act of 1833 also charged the Governor-General-in-Council (to whose title was now added [...] "of India") with the supervision of civil and military administration of the totality of India, as well granting the office the exclusive power of legislation. Since the British territories in north India had now extended up to Delhi, the Act also sanctioned the creation of a Presidency of Agra. With the annexation of Oudh in 1856, this territory was extended and eventually became the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. In addition, in 1854, a Lieutenant-Governor was appointed for the region of Bengal, Bihar and Odisha, leaving the Governor-General to concentrate on the governance of India.|$|E
