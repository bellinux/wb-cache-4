5|$|Except for Æsthetic Club meetings, the <b>Tower</b> <b>Building</b> {{remained}} largely unoccupied for almost fifty years and suffered significant deterioration. The Æsthetic Club provided much-needed financial support {{during the period}} and even paid the electric bill during the Great Depression. The Æsthetic Club is still headquartered in the <b>Tower</b> <b>Building.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1942, the <b>Tower</b> <b>Building</b> was renovated due to {{the efforts}} of the Æsthetic Club, Little Rock philanthropist Frederick W. Allsop, and the Works Progress Administration. It became the new home of the Arkansas Museum of Natural History and Antiquities, which had been located in Little Rock City Hall. The museum {{remained}} in the <b>tower</b> <b>building</b> for approximately fifty-five years. The area surrounding the <b>Tower</b> <b>Building</b> had been known as Arsenal Park when the first decommissioned and then later renamed City Park. Due {{to the efforts of}} Bernie Babcock, however, the city finally named it MacArthur Park in 1942 in honor of Douglas MacArthur.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the Museum of Science and Natural History {{merged with}} the Little Rock Children's Museum, which had been located in Union Station, to form the Arkansas Museum of Discovery. The new museum was {{relocated}} to a historic building in the Little Rock River Market District. The MacArthur Museum of Arkansas Military History opened on May 19, 2001 in the <b>Tower</b> <b>Building.</b> The new museum's goal is to educate and inform visitors about the military history of Arkansas, preserve the <b>Tower</b> <b>Building,</b> honor servicemen and servicewomen of the United States and commemorate the birthplace of Douglas MacArthur.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} and the surrounding park were used for many public purposes throughout the early 20th century. The <b>Tower</b> <b>Building</b> served as headquarters for the United Confederate Veterans Reunion, May 15–18, 1911. Over 106,000 Civil War veterans, the largest popular gathering {{in the history of}} the city up to that time, attended and were housed in the building or camped in the park, which had also become a popular camping area. Later the building served as an armory for the Arkansas National Guard. In 1912, the second floor of the <b>Tower</b> <b>Building</b> became Little Rock's first public library. In 1917, Little Rock built a fire station in the park. A band shell named for H. H. Foster also was built in the park during this time, but no longer exists. In 1936, Works Progress Administration built the Museum of Fine Arts, now called the Arkansas Arts Center, just south of the <b>Tower</b> <b>Building.</b>|$|E

25|$|Before the Bell Tower was {{constructed}} in 1899, a farmhouse owned by James E. Williams, who would later be mayor of Atlanta, stood in the spot. From this location, General John B. Hood directed Confederate forces in the Battle of Atlanta on July 22, 1864. The Bell <b>Tower</b> <b>building</b> as it stands today was originally the sexton's office and living quarters. Atop the tower is a bell that was formerly used to signal for workers to gather at that location, and for funerals. The basement {{was used as a}} vault for storing coffins awaiting burial. In 1998 the Bell <b>Tower</b> <b>building</b> saw extensive restoration and now serves as the offices of the Historic Oakland Foundation as well as the cemetery's visitor center.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to longstanding FAA {{concerns that the}} airport's air traffic control tower, located atop Terminal 2, could not withstand a major earthquake, on July 9, 2012, crews broke ground for a new torch-shaped tower. The new tower is located between Terminals 1 and 2, and {{the base of the}} <b>tower</b> <b>building</b> contains passages between the two terminals for passengers both pre- and post-security screening, which dictated the narrow tower base. Originally scheduled for completion in the summer of 2016 at a cost of $102million, the new tower began operations on October 15, 2016.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, the University opened {{many more}} major buildings, {{such as the}} Jessop Building, the Soundhouse, Jessop West and the Information Commons.

A new six-storey building, the Diamond, was opened on 28 September 2015. In February 2016, the {{university}} started to work with Sheffield City Council to transform public spaces around the campus. The £8million project includes building and improving pedestrianisation, crossings, cycle routes, as well as greening the campus.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tower</b> <b>buildings</b> {{can be very}} {{sensitive}} to dynamic actions and their dynamic analysis is usually carried out numerically through sophisticated finite element models. In this paper, an equivalent nonlinear one-dimensional shear–shear–torsional beam model immersed in a three-dimensional space is introduced to reproduce, in an approximate way, the dynamic behavior of <b>tower</b> <b>buildings.</b> It represents an extension of a linear beam model recently introduced by the authors, accounting for nonlinearities generated by the stretching of the columns. The constitutive law of the beam is identified from a discrete model of a 3 D-frame, via a homogenization process, which accounts for {{the rotation of the}} floors around the tower axis. The macroscopic shear strain in the equivalent beam is produced by the bending of columns, accompanied by negligible rotation of the floors. A coupled nonlinear shear–torsional mechanical model is thus obtained. The coupling between shear and torsion is related to a non-symmetric layout of the columns, while mechanical nonlinearities are proportional to the slenderness of the columns. The model can be used for the analysis of the response of <b>tower</b> <b>buildings</b> to any kind of dynamic and static excitation. A first application is here presented to investigate the effect of mechanical and aerodynamic coupling on the critical galloping conditions and on the postcritical behavior of <b>tower</b> <b>buildings,</b> based on a quasi-steady model of aerodynamic forces...|$|R

25|$|At {{the time}} of its nationalisation, Northern Rock was {{developing}} two new offices. At its headquarters at the Regent Centre complex in Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne the bank was midway through construction of a 10-storey tower that would provide a focus for the whole site. As the redundancy programme has made the new space surplus to capacity, the bank sought to sell or lease the <b>tower</b> <b>building</b> to a third party. The bank also developed a site at Rainton Bridge, which was also surplus to capacity, and it sold the site to npower.|$|E
25|$|The 1960s saw {{the further}} {{development}} of the Queen's College campus {{with some of the}} earliest multi-story towers in Scotland being built for both teaching and student accommodation. The <b>Tower</b> <b>Building,</b> opened in 1961, exemplified early Scottish modernist architecture; it stands 140ft tall with ten storeys home to both academic and administrative departments of the university. Belmont Halls of Residence took inspiration from Danish design and aimed to provide modern, spacious quarters for students while keeping costs cheap; it was completed in 1963 on the site of Belmont Works, a former jute mill.|$|E

25|$|Windows on the World was {{a complex}} of venues on the top floors (106th and 107th) of the North <b>Tower</b> (<b>Building</b> One) of the {{original}} World Trade Center complex in Lower Manhattan that included a restaurant called Windows on the World, a smaller restaurant called Wild Blue, a bar called The Greatest Bar on Earth, and rooms for private functions. Developed by restaurateur Joe Baum and designed initially by Warren Platner, Windows on the World occupied 50,000 square feet (4,600 m²) of space in the North Tower. The restaurants operated from April 19, 1976 until September 11, 2001 when they were destroyed in the September 11 attacks.|$|E

In 1861 John Brunner came to work at Hutchinson's, joining his older brother Henry, and he was soon appointed as the office manager. In 1862 the German chemist Ludwig Mond also joined Hutchinson's and a friendship developed between the Brunners and Mond. The association between John Brunner and Ludwig Mond was later to develop into the chemical business of Brunner Mond and Company in Northwich.|$|E
