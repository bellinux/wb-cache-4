40|$|Threshold {{models are}} useful for {{understanding}} the evolution of dimorphic traits with polygenic bases. Selection for <b>threshold</b> <b>characters</b> on individuals {{is expected to be}} frequency dependent because of the peculiar way that selection views underlying genetic and environmental factors. Selection among individuals is inefficient because individual phenotypes fall into only two discrete categories that map imperfectly to the underlying genes. Incidence, however, can be continuously distributed among groups, making among-group selection relatively more efficient. Differently put, the group-mean phenotype can be a better predictor of an individual's genotype than that individual's own phenotype. Because evolution in group-structured populations is governed by the balance of selection within and between groups, we can expect threshold traits to evolve in fundamentally different ways when group mean fitness is a function of morph frequency. We extend the theory of selection on threshold traits to include group selection using contextual analysis. For the simple case of linear group-fitness functions, we show that the group-level component of selection, like the individual-level component, is frequency dependent. However, the conditions that determine which component dominates when levels of selection are in conflict (as described by Hamilton's rule) are not frequency dependent. Thus, enhanced group selection is not an inherent property of <b>threshold</b> <b>characters.</b> Nevertheless, we show that predicting the effects of multiple levels of selection on dimorphic traits requires special considerations of the threshold model...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Container code {{examination}} is {{an essential}} step in the container flow management. To date, this step is mostly achieved by human visual inspections, which are however time-consuming and error-prone. We hence propose a new computer vision system for automated container code recognition. The proposed system consists of model construction and code recognition stages. In the model construction stage, we first incorporate a locally thresholding method with prior knowledge of code character geometry to segment the code characters, including English characters A-Z and numeric characters 0 - 9, from a training set of container images. With the segmentation results of each character, we subsequently construct its Eigen-feature model using the principal component analysis (PCA). In the recognition stage, the code characters are firstly segmented from the given container image. Each segmented character is then recognized by finding the best matched Eigen-feature model that maintains the minimal PCA reconstruction error of the character appearance. Experiments showed that the proposed method achieved the code recognition with a high recognition rate and little recognition time for each image automatically. Overall, our proposed system has great potential for improving the efficiency of container terminals as well as enhancing the container management.

This includes as special cases the kinds of phenotypes usually considered (qualitative, quantitative, and <b>threshold</b> <b>characters)</b> and all others. Correspondingly general methods are indicated for analyzing data of all forms in terms of the classical Mendelian factor concept (as distinct from the biometrical methods usually applied to measurement and graded data, associated with the effective factor concept). These are applied in a new analysis of the data of E. L. Green (1951, 1954, 1962) on skeletal variation in the mouse. The adequacies of various classical one-factor and several-factor models are considered. Indications of an underlying scale are found from this new standpoint. The results are compared with those obtained by Green using the scaling approach. An illustrative application is also made to some of Bruell's (1962) continuous behavioural data on mice.

We assume for character extraction merely that characters occupy plane areas and consist of narrow lines. The proposed method makes it possible to choose an appropriate threshold for each point using the gray level of the nearest edge points.

40|$|Abstract Background Reading with {{a central}} scotoma {{involves}} the use of preferred retinal loci (PRLs) that enable both letter resolution and global viewing of word. Spontaneously developed PRLs however often privilege spatial resolution and, as a result, visual span is commonly limited by the position of the scotoma. In this study we designed and performed the pilot trial of a training procedure aimed at modifying oculomotor behavior in subjects with central field loss. We use an additional fixation point which, when combined with the initial PRL, allows the fulfillment of both letter resolution and global viewing of words. Methods The training procedure comprises ten training sessions conducted with the scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO). Subjects have to read single letters and isolated words varying in length, by combining the use of their initial PRL with the one of an examiner's selected trained retinal locus (TRL). We enrolled five subjects to test for the feasibility of the training technique. They showed stable maculopathy and persisting major reading difficulties despite previous orthoptic rehabilitation. We evaluated ETDRS visual acuity, <b>threshold</b> <b>character</b> size for single letters and isolated words, accuracy for paragraphed text reading and reading strategies before, immediately after SLO training, and three months later. Results Training the use of multiple PRLs in patients with central field loss is feasible and contributes to adapt oculomotor strategies during reading related tasks. Immediately after SLO training subjects used in combination with their initial PRL the examiner's selected TRL and other newly self-selected PRLs. Training gains were also reflected in ETDRS acuity, <b>threshold</b> <b>character</b> size for words of different lengths and in paragraphed text reading. Interestingly, subjects benefited variously from the training procedure and gains were retained differently as a function of word length. Conclusion We designed a new procedure for training patients with central field loss using scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. Our initial results on the acquisition of newly self-selected PRLs and the development of new oculomotor behaviors suggest that the procedure aiming primarily at developing an examiner's selected TRL might have initiated a more global functional adaptation process. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} of a displayed message {{is the first}} step of the cognitive process to identify its meaning. It can be psychophysically evaluated through measurement of contrast. The intrinsic contrast (Ci) is a physical parameter depending on display characteristics and environmental light distribution. The perceived contrast (Cp) is our real parameter of interest and it is obtained from Ci considering the veiling luminance (LVeil), evaluated with a mathematical model of the eyes properties. Disability glare is due to the scatter of light within the eye, and it results in veiling light superimposed over the normal scene, effectively reducing contrast of objects observed. On equal conditions of vision, it reduces perceived contrast and its value can descends under the threshold of perception making not legible the information displayed otherwise perfectly detectable. We calculate Cp adding LVeil both on target and background luminance, to Ci: As LVeil increase, Rc (Cp /Ci) goes from 1 to 0, Cp decreases and can reach a value under the contrast <b>threshold</b> rendering the <b>character</b> illegible.

The contrast threshold of visual words was measured with a spatial two-alternative forced-choice paradigm and a PSI adaptive method. The observers were to indicate which of two sides contained a stimulus in the detection task, and which contained a real character (as opposed to a pseudo- or non-character) in the discrimination task. When the target size was sufficiently small, the detection <b>threshold</b> of a <b>character</b> decreased as its size increased, with a slope of − 1 / 2 on log–log coordinates, up to a critical size at all eccentricities and for all stimulus types. The discrimination threshold decreased with target size with a slope of − 1 up to a critical size that was dependent on stimulus type and eccentricity. Beyond that size, the threshold decreased with a slope of − 1 / 2 on log–log coordinates before leveling out. The data was well fit by a spatial summation model that contains local receptive fields (RFs) and a summation across these filters within an attention window. Our result implies that detection is mediated by local RFs smaller than any tested stimuli and thus detection performance is dominated by summation across receptive fields.

We investigated the function of males' substrate-borne vibrations by examining phenotypic correlates of vibratory signal traits and assessing whether these affect female mating and remating decisions. Virgin females were first paired with males, and females that copulated in first trials were then paired with a second male to determine whether females remate. We measured vibratory signals produced by males during these interactions to determine 1) correlations between substrate-borne signal traits and male phenotypes, 2) whether properties of substrate-borne signals predicted mating success in first and second copulations, and 3) whether females of different mating status have different acceptance <b>thresholds</b> for male <b>characters.</b> Courtship vibration rate {{was positively correlated with}} male leg size, and signaling rate significantly predicted mating success in all copulations. Some females were polyandrous; however, copulation with mated females occurred after longer courtship durations, and courtship duration was positively correlated with male size, demonstrating that mated females are less receptive to mates and suggesting that females may be trading up in subsequent matings. Our study shows that males invest significant effort in courtship and that sexual selection via female choice may play a nontrivial role in the mating system. These results are the first to show that honest information about male size is encoded by substrate vibrations, and these signals are important for male mating success in both virgin and mated females.

40|$|One of {{the major}} reasons for {{socio-economic}} crises in democratic states and dissatisfaction of their citizens lies in the defects of the election procedures. This concerns, in particular, viewing the majority principle as an autonomous purpose of free elections. It is commonly acknowledged that the electoral act satisfies democratic standards if it guarantees a result {{which is consistent with}} the will {{of the major}}ity of electors. Areas such as individual traits of candidates, as well as an objective value of their responses to referendum questions, become of secondary importance and are not covered by the electoral law. Such an approach seems to be correct and is usually not challenged, and is even regarded to be an axiom that needs no justification. The matter ceases to be so certain, though, when in the hierarchy of purposes in a democratic system, the common good and personal interest related to it are placed above the majority principle. Although such a situation is generally provided for by constitutions, in political practice, when solving specific matters, this is no longer obvious and the will of the majority gains absolute dominance. In the assessment of such a state of affairs, one should also take into consideration the fact that the communication techniques used in election campaigns may distort the truth about the candidates or the actual value attached to the particular options offered in the referendum outcomes. Hence it seems necessary to incorporate in the electoral act {{as well as in the}} constitution certain criteria that would guarantee minimal <b>thresholds</b> of moral <b>character</b> and would determine the substantive competence of candidates running for public office. What is more, the law should preclude referenda on matters the objective value of which does not depend on the views of the electors.
