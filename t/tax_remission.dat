50|$|His three years' stay in Constantinople was wearisome and {{otherwise}} disagreeable; the leisure it forced upon him he devoted {{in part to}} literary composition. Aurelianus succeeded in granting him the <b>tax</b> <b>remission</b> for Cyrene and the Pentapolis and the exemption from curial obligations for him, but then he fell in disgrace and Synesius lost everything. Later Aurelian returned in power, restoring his own grants to Synesius. The poet, then, composed Aegyptus sive de providentia, an allegory in which the good Osiris and the evil Typhon, who represent Aurelian and the Goth Gainas (ministers under Arcadius), strive for mastery, {{and the question of}} the divine permission of evil is handled.|$|E

50|$|Like Guy Burgess, Blunt {{was known}} to be homosexual, which was a {{criminal}} activity at that time in Britain. Both were members of the Cambridge Apostles (also known as the Conversazione Society), a clandestine Cambridge discussion group of 12 undergraduates, mostly from Trinity and King's Colleges who considered themselves to be the brightest minds in the university. Many were homosexual and Marxist at that time. Amongst other members, also later accused of being part of the Cambridge spy ring, were the American Michael Whitney Straight and Victor Rothschild who later worked for MI5. Rothschild gave Blunt £100 to purchase Eliezar and Rebecca by Nicolas Poussin.

5000|$|With {{the help}} of his new foederati, Majorian entered the Rhone Valley, conquering its populations [...] "some by arms and some by diplomacy". He {{defeated}} the Burgundians and besieged and conquered the city of Lugdunum: the rebel city was heavily fined, while the Bagaudae were forced to join the Empire. Despite the fact that the Gallo-Roman aristocracy had sided with Avitus, Majorian wanted a reconciliation, not a punishment. With the intercession of Majorian, magister epistolarum Petrus, Sidonius Apollinaris, the son-in-law of Avitus, was allowed to deliver a panegyric in honour of the Emperor (early January 459), receiving in reward the appointment to the rank of comes spectabilis. Much more effective was, however, the granting of the <b>tax</b> <b>remission</b> that the citizens of Lugdunum had requested from Leo I.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the scaling down of {{hostilities}} as peace returned to China after the Manchu conquest, and also as {{a result of}} the ensuing rapid increase of population, land cultivation and therefore tax revenues based on agriculture, the Kangxi Emperor was able first to make <b>tax</b> <b>remissions,</b> then in 1712 to freeze the land tax and corvée altogether, without embarrassing the state treasury (although the dynasty eventually suffered from this fiscal policy).|$|R

The receipts ratio did not fall below the 1979 level until 1992. The expenditure ratio rose again after Thatcher's resignation in 1990, even climbing for a time above the 1979 figure. The cause was the heavy budget charge of the recessions of 1979-81 and 1990-92 and the extra funding required to meet the higher level of unemployment.|$|R
50|$|The real {{authority}} in Central Tibet {{during these years}} rested with the dpon-chen. A Changchub Rinchen was appointed by Khubilai Khan in 1281, but soon fell ill and died or was murdered (1281/82). He was succeeded by Kunga Zhonnu (1282-c. 1285) and Zhonnu Wangchuk (c. 1285-1288). At this time Central Tibet was severely impoverished. Kunga Zhonnu ordered a <b>tax</b> <b>remission</b> and in 1287 a revision of the 1268 census was carried out to establish a sounder fiscal base. As for Dharmapala he vacated his position as Dishi in 1286 and departed from the imperial court to revisit Tibet and Sakya. However, he died on his way at Tre Mandala (Chuwo) on 24 December 1287. He was married to Palden, a granddaughter of Köden, and also to a lady from Zhalu called Jowo Tagibum. The last-mentioned bore him a son Ratnabhadra who {{died at the age}} of five. Thus this branch of the Khon family died out. Khubilai Khan appointed a Sakya abbot and a Dishi, neither of whom belonged to the Khon lineage. It was only in 1306 that Sakya was once again ruled by a relative of Dharmapala, Zangpo Pal.|$|E
40|$|Extract] A uniform code - in Pt IVC of the TAA (ss 14 ZL to 14 ZZS) - {{governs the}} {{procedures}} for challenging a taxation decision made under various Commonwealth Tax Acts, including the ITAA 1997, ITAA 1936, TAA and FBTAA. The uniform code applies where an Act or Regulations provide {{that a person}} or entity "dissatisfied with" an assessment, determination, notice or decision or with a failure to make a private ruling may object against it in accordance with Pt IVC: s 14 ZL(1). For example, s 175 A of ITAA 1936 gives a taxpayer the right to object against an income tax assessment. A GST assessment is reviewable under Pt IVC: see s 105 - 40 Pt 3 - 10 Sch 1 TAA. The expression "dissatisfied with" is not defined in Pt IVC, {{but it seems that}} it means more than its ordinary dictionary meaning of "displeased with" and that an entity cannot object against a taxation decision unless the decision has legal effect in relation to that entity: see CTC Resources NL v FCT (1994) 27 ATR 403 at 414, 435. A mere curiosity or interest in the decision will not suffice. Importantly the Pt IVC system applies not only to assessments but also to a range of other decisions which the Commissioner may make under the various taxing Acts. Part IVC is based on the concept of the "taxation decision", which is defined in s 14 ZQ: [RL 1 / 2520 - 10]. The expression means any assessment, determination, notice or decision against which a "taxation objection" may be made; that is, any assessment, determination, notice or decision which the Commissioner may make under a taxing Act, and which that taxing Act provides may be objected against in the manner set out in Pt IVC. It includes a private ruling made under Div 359 of Schedule 1 TAA (per s 359 - 60) but not a public ruling made under Div 358. Each taxing Act now contains provisions which allow persons affected by certain assessments, determinations, notices, and decisions made under that Act to "object [...] . in the manner set out in Part IVC 1953 ". The objection is referred to as a "taxation objection": s 14 ZL(2) [RL 1 / 2505]. If two or more taxation decisions are notified in the one notice, they are treated as one decision for Pt IVC purposes, except to the extent that a decision consists of an ineligible income <b>tax</b> <b>remission</b> decision - that is taken to be a separate objection decision for the purposes of any review or appeal: s 14 ZR [RL 1 / 2530]...|$|E

50|$|To {{mitigate}} {{the damage caused}} by a series of natural disasters, Empress Dowager Deng's government attempted various relief measures of <b>tax</b> <b>remissions,</b> donations to the poor, and immediate shipping of government grain to the most hard-hit areas. Although some water control works were repaired in 115 CE and 116 CE, many government projects became underfunded due to these relief efforts and the armed response to the large-scale Qiang people's rebellion of 107-118 CE. Aware of her financial constraints, the Empress Dowager limited the expenses at banquets, the fodder for imperial horses who weren't pulling carriages, and the amount of luxury goods manufactured by the imperial workshops. She approved the sale of some civil offices and even secondary marquess ranks to collect more revenue; the sale of offices was continued by Emperor Huan and became extremely prevalent during Emperor Ling's reign.|$|R
5|$|Because small landowning {{families}} {{represented the}} mainstay of the Han tax base, the Han government attempted to aid and protect small landowners and to limit the power of wealthy landlords and merchants. The government reduced taxes in times of poor harvest and provided relief after disasters. <b>Tax</b> <b>remissions</b> and crop seed loans encouraged displaced peasants {{to return to their}} land. An edict in 94 AD excused displaced peasants from paying land and labor service taxes for a year upon returning to their own farms. The land tax on agricultural production was reduced in 168 BC from a rate of one-fifteenth of crop yield to one-thirtieth, and abolished in 167 BC. However, the tax was reinstated in 156 BC at a rate of one-thirtieth. At the beginning of the Eastern Han, the land tax rate was one-tenth of the crop yield, but following the stabilization following Wang Mang's death, the rate was reduced to the original one-thirtieth in 30 AD.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} Tacitus' treatment of eastern topics in {{sections of the}} Histories and 							the Annals related to trips from or to Rome.

Thus the internal structure and the connection with the surrounding narrative of 							each episode as well as the references to mythical and historical accounts and characters 							(from remote and recent history), and to ruins, sanctuaries and cult statues are explored. 							Chapter 1 (Titus' trip and the consultation of the sanctuary of Paphos, Hist. 2. 1 - 4) 							suggests that the remoteness of the place and of the traditions and Titus' oracle, do not 							divert the attention, but emphasise the beginning of the Flavian revolt. Chapter 2 							examines Vespasian's visits to the sanctuaries in Mount Carmel in Syria and in 							Alexandria in Egypt (Hist. 2. 78 and 4. 81 - 84). Chapter 3 deals with the account ofthe 							siege of Jerusalem and the digression on the Jews (Hist. 5. 1 - 13). Chapter 4 is about 							Germanicus' eastern trip (Ann. 2. 56 - 61). And finally, chapter 5 (Ann. 2. 47; 3. 60 - 65; 4. 							 13 - 14; 4. 55 - 56 and 12. 61 - 63) examines the interventions in the Senate of eastern 							ambassadors who ask for concessions such as <b>tax</b> <b>remissions,</b> rights of asylum and rights 							for constructing temples.
