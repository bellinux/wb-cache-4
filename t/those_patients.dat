5|$|Recent {{focus has}} been to reduce therapy for low and {{intermediate}} risk neuroblastoma while maintaining survival rates at 90%. A study of 467 intermediate risk patients enrolled in A3961 from 1997 to 2005 confirmed the hypothesis that therapy could be successfully reduced for this risk group. Those with favorable characteristics (tumor grade and response) received four cycles of chemotherapy, and those with unfavorable characteristics received eight cycles, with three-year event free survival and overall survival stable at 90% for the entire cohort. Future plans are to intensify treatment for <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> with aberration of 1p36 or 11q23 chromosomes {{as well as for}} those who lack early response to treatment.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive and emotional: neuropsychiatric {{symptomatology}} {{is common}} {{in the course of}} the disease. Depression and anxiety appear in up to 80% of patients,. Emotional lability leading to uncontrollable crying is also common. These symptoms can be treated with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy; however, high quality studies on efficacy are lacking. For example, in the specific case of antidepressants and depression, only two studies were considered worth considering as of 2011 by the Cochrane collaboration and they only showed a trend towards efficacy. Other neuropsychiatric symptoms are euphoria and disinhibition. Cognitive impairment is a frequent complication of MS even after the introduction of disease-modifying treatments in the last 20 years. Although the disease is usually the primary cause of cognitive problems, other factors such as medications, relapses or depression may be enhancing them so a correct evaluation of the deficits and factors exacerbating them is important. Regarding primary deficits, data point towards administration of L-amphetamine and methylphenidate being useful, whereas memantine and anticholinesterase drugs such as donepezil—commonly used in Alzheimer disease— are not considered effective in improving cognitive functions. Effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation therapy is more controverted. For <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> with MS who have pseudobulbar affect (PBA), characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays, Dextromethorphan/quinidine can be considered as treatment as it is the only FDA approved drug for treatment for PBA, though other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants have been used in clinical practice.|$|E
5|$|Many {{classification}} {{systems have}} been developed {{in an effort to}} predict difficulty of tracheal intubation, including the Cormack-Lehane classification system, the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS), and the Mallampati score. The Mallampati score is drawn from the observation that the size of the base of the tongue influences the difficulty of intubation. It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth, and in particular the visibility of the base of palatine uvula, faucial pillars and the soft palate. Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only <b>those</b> <b>patients</b> who are difficult to intubate. Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system, found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 25% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system. Under certain emergency circumstances (e.g., severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury), it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation. In such cases, alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{correlation}} of serum Lp-PLA 2 and NSE levels with nerve injury degree and lipid metabolism change in patients with acute cerebral infarction. Methods: Patients diagnosed with acute cerebral infarction in our hospital between March 2014 and October 2016 were selected as the cerebral infarction group of the study, and healthy subjects receiving physical examination {{during the same period}} were selected as control group. Serum was collected to determine the levels of Lp-PLA 2 and NSE as well as the content of nerve injury molecules and lipid metabolism molecules. Results: Serum Lp-PLA 2, NSE, NO, MDA, LPO, 8 -OHdG, ox-LDL, LDL-C and ApoB levels of cerebral infarction group were significantly higher than those of control group while HDL-C and ApoA 1 content were significantly lower than those of control group; serum NO, MDA, LPO and 8 -OHdG content of patients with NSE ＞Q 3 were significantly higher than <b>those</b> of <b>patients</b> with＜Q 1, Q 1 -Q 2 and Q 2 -Q 3, serum NO, MDA, LPO and 8 -OHdG content of patients with Q 2 -Q 3 were significantly higher than <b>those</b> of <b>patients</b> with＜Q 1 and Q 1 -Q 2, and serum NO, MDA, LPO and 8 -OHdG content of patients with Q 1 -Q 2 were significantly higher than <b>those</b> of <b>patients</b> with<Q 1; serum ox-LDL, LDL-C and ApoB content of patients with Lp-PLA 2 ＞Q 3 were significantly higher than <b>those</b> of <b>patients</b> with<Q 1, Q 1 -Q 2 and Q 2 -Q 3 while HDL-C and ApoA 1 content were significantly lower than <b>those</b> of <b>patients</b> with<Q 1, Q 1 -Q 2 and Q 2 -Q 3; serum ox-LDL, LDL-C and ApoB content of patients with Q 2 -Q 3 were significantly higher than <b>those</b> of <b>patients</b> with <Q 1 and Q 1 -Q 2 while HDL-C and ApoA 1 content were significantly lower than <b>those</b> of <b>patients</b> with<Q 1 and Q 1 -Q 2; serum ox-LDL, LDL-C and ApoB content of patients with Q 1 -Q 2 were significantly higher than <b>those</b> of <b>patients</b> with<Q 1 while HDL-C and ApoA 1 content were significantly lower than <b>those</b> of <b>patients</b> with<Q 1. Conclusion: Serum Lp-PLA 2 and NSE levels increase significantly in patients with acute cerebral infarction, the increase of Lp-PLA 2 is associated with abnormal lipid metabolism, and the increase of NSE is associated with neural oxidative damage...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study and}} {{investigate}} the diagnostic value of PETCT and CT perfusion imaging {{in the types}} and classifications of patients with cerebral tumor. Methods: A total of 75 patients with cerebral tumor treated in our hospital from December 2011 to April 2015 were selected as the research object. All the patients were scanned with PETCT, then they were detected with CT perfusion imaging, and then the detection results of patients with different types were compared. The detection results of patients with different classifications of brain glioma and different types of metastatic encephaloma were compared as well. Results: The CBF, CBV and PS in patients with meningiomas were all higher than <b>those</b> of <b>patients</b> with brain glioma and metastatic encephaloma, while the MTT was shorter than <b>those</b> of <b>patients</b> with brain glioma and metastatic encephaloma. The SUV value and SUVmax positive rate in patients with brain glioma and metastatic encephaloma were higher than <b>those</b> of <b>patients</b> with meningiomas, while the CBF, CBV, PS, SUV value and SUVmax positive rate in patients with higher classifications of brain glioma were all higher than <b>those</b> of <b>patients</b> with lower classifications, while the MTT was shorter than <b>those</b> of <b>patients</b> with lower classifications of brain glioma. But <b>those</b> indexes in <b>patients</b> with different types of metastatic encephaloma had no significant differences.

25|$|Adverse {{reactions}} to local anesthetics (especially the esters) are not uncommon, but true allergy is very rare.
