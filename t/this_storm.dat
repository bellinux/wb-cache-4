5|$|After no {{tropical}} cyclone activity in July and August, the third tropical storm formed offshore of southwestern Mexico on September3. Like {{the previous two}} {{tropical cyclone}}, <b>this</b> <b>storm</b> had a peak of 50mph (80km/h), and did not intensify further. Tropical Storm Three headed northwestward, and began paralleling the coast of Baja California. On September8, Tropical Storm Three turned abruptly south-southwestward, and dissipated by the next day. The outer rainbands of this system were expected to bring squally weather over the Baja California Peninsula; instead, <b>this</b> <b>storm</b> turned away without causing any impact.|$|E
5|$|As Ambo (Neoguri) passed {{directly}} through many parts Visayas and Mindanao, PAGASA issued Public Storm Warning Signals for these areas. Signal number one was issued for southern Negros, Siquijor and Camiguin. <b>This</b> <b>storm</b> signal was later scaled back {{up until the}} storm reached Palawan and the South China Sea.|$|E
5|$|Gale-force winds {{covered the}} far {{northern}} Atlantic between Western Europe and Atlantic Canada, {{due to the}} intensity of <b>this</b> <b>storm,</b> with hurricane-force winds confined near its center of circulation. After reaching its peak intensity, the system weakened as it moved into the far northeast Atlantic, dissipating by 17 January. <b>This</b> <b>storm</b> caused blizzards across much of Scotland {{and led to the}} final breakup of the oil tanker MV Braer, which had been stranded in rocks off the Shetland Islands by a previous storm nearly a week beforehand.|$|E
5000|$|<b>This</b> <b>stormed</b> {{formed in}} the {{southern}} Indian Ocean on 10 May 1997. It dissipated on 16 May. http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/history/wa/1997.shtml ...|$|R
30|$|Also, {{contrary}} {{to the findings of}} most storm damage-vegetation assessments, least sediment mass was generated from areas of pastoral hill country suggesting they lay at the outer edge of <b>this</b> <b>storms</b> influence and that rainfall intensity and totals were below the threshold required to initiate slope failure.|$|R
50|$|After a {{month of}} inactivity, a {{tropical}} storm formed several thousands of miles south-west of {{the southern tip of}} Baja California. <b>This</b> tropical <b>storm</b> began moving north-westwards while keeping its intensity. Winds peaked at 50 mph (85 km/h). On July 19, <b>this</b> tropical <b>storm</b> began moving west and finally dissipated 3 days later.|$|R
5|$|July 19, 1850 — A {{hurricane}} destroys a Coney Island bath {{house and}} causes heavy rain, although damage is unknown. <b>This</b> <b>storm</b> destroyed the ship Elizabeth off Fire Island and drowned American transcendentalist Margaret Fuller.|$|E
5|$|July 1954: Three years later, the {{remnants}} of another hurricane moved over Arizona from the south {{during the month of}} July. Damage from <b>this</b> <b>storm</b> is unknown.|$|E
5|$|November 10–14, 2009– The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Ida {{contribute to the}} emergence of an extratropical cyclone that brought heavy rainfall and gusty winds to the state. 7.40 in (188 mm) of rain fell in Assateague Island. <b>This</b> <b>storm</b> would later be known as the November 2009 Mid-Atlantic nor'easter.|$|E
50|$|I. On July 30 and July 31, <b>this</b> {{tropical}} <b>storm</b> affected Jamaica.|$|R
5000|$|On September 14, a {{tropical}} cyclone formed {{off the coast}} of Central America. <b>This</b> tropical <b>storm</b> tracked northwestward and intensified into a hurricane. [...] The sea-level pressure dropped to [...] or lower. The hurricane recurved gradually to the northeast and weakened over cool seas. On September 25, <b>this</b> tropical <b>storm</b> made landfall near Long Beach, California, and dissipated inland.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> {{significant}} <b>storm</b> killed 750 {{people and}} led to a loss of 30,000 cattle.|$|R
5|$|October 2, 1858: The 1858 San Diego {{hurricane}} approached {{very close}} to southern California. It brought several hours of hurricane and gale-force winds to an area stretching from San Diego to Los Angeles. <b>This</b> <b>storm</b> was reconstructed as just missing making landfall, dissipating offshore.|$|E
5|$|The name David was retired {{following}} <b>this</b> <b>storm</b> {{because of}} its devastation and high death toll, and will never be used again for an Atlantic hurricane, making it the first male hurricane name to be retired. It was replaced with Danny for the 1985 season.|$|E
5|$|The name Iniki was retired due to <b>this</b> <b>storm,</b> and was {{replaced}} with Iolana within the Central North Pacific tropical storm list. Less than three days after Iniki struck, Hurricane Orlene struck the Big Island as a depression.|$|E
500|$|On September 14, a {{tropical}} cyclone formed {{off the coast}} of Central America. [...] <b>This</b> tropical <b>storm</b> tracked northwestward and intensified into a hurricane.

On September 25, <b>this</b> tropical <b>storm</b> made landfall near Long Beach, California, and dissipated inland.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> was <b>Storming</b> Robots' {{first year}} {{participating}} in RCJ, {{and there were}} only two teams.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> {{short-lived}} <b>storm</b> {{was likely}} a subtropical storm {{but there was}} no satellite imagery to confirm its structure.|$|R
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>storm</b> {{is known}} {{from a single}} ship report. On July25, the bark Daniel bound for New York from Matamoros, Tamaulipas {{encountered}} a tropical storm off the Alacran reef, north of the Yucatan Peninsula. The vessel spent several hours in the cyclone and was also struck by lightning.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-two {{people lost}} their lives in {{accidents}} caused by Cyclone Rewa, while it affected parts off the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Australia, New Caledonia, Vanuatu and New Zealand. Due to the impact of <b>this</b> <b>storm,</b> the name Rewa was retired.|$|E
5|$|Another intense {{hurricane}} churned the Gulf of Mexico {{in early}} October, this time tracking from southwest to northeast. The storm moved very slowly and sank or impaired numerous ships along its course. Striking northern Florida on October 5 as {{the equivalent of}} a major hurricane, the cyclone produced extreme wind gusts to the north of its center and exceptionally high tides to the south. Extensive property in Tallahassee accounted for an estimated $500,000 (1842 USD) in losses. On Cedar Key, the storm surge demolished buildings and threatened to submerge the island. The storm turned northward as it entered the western Atlantic, resulting in strong winds and flooding tides in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina. Later in the month, an extremely rare hurricane formed in the far eastern Atlantic, to the southwest of Madeira. <b>This</b> <b>storm</b> passed near the islands on October 27 before making landfall in southwestern Spain. Accompanied by significant damage, both along the coast and inland, <b>this</b> <b>storm</b> is considered a historical analogue to Hurricane Vince of 2005. Several other storms also had an impact on land throughout the season.|$|E
50|$|Overall, <b>this</b> weak <b>storm</b> {{killed at}} least 180 people in Yemen. Damage is {{estimated}} at about $1 billion (US$).|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> {{tropical}} <b>storm</b> formed {{near the}} coast of Africa on September 7, however it was short lived and never approached land.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> same <b>storm</b> wrecked {{at least}} eleven ships, and damaged about 12 others, on the Great Lakes that day, with loss of several crews.|$|R
5|$|Convection {{continued}} but the cyclone was encountering extensive easterly to north-easterly {{wind shear}} which stinted {{the strengthening of}} <b>this</b> <b>storm</b> throughout its history. The cyclone initially headed toward the west-northwest around a subtropical ridge that was centered over the western Gulf of Mexico. The depression moved north west, parallel with {{the west coast of}} Mexico due to being steered by the mid/upper-level ridge. On August 31, it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette, 85miles (137km) south of Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|Maria never {{approached}} any land areas while {{a tropical}} system, but tracked toward northern Europe after becoming an extratropical storm on September 10. The first land effects were felt in Iceland on September 12, where tropical storm-force winds were reported. The strongest winds {{were recorded in}} Vestmannaeyjar where sustained winds in excess of 67mph (107km/h) were reported {{as well as a}} minimum pressure of 979 mbar. The storm then brushed the northernmost part of Scotland, with no reported damage there either. The extratropical Maria merged with another system and <b>this</b> <b>storm</b> made landfall in Norway. <b>This</b> <b>storm</b> brought tropical storm force winds and heavy rainfall to that country, and caused flooding and several mudslides, particularly around Bergen, the most important of which occurred in Hatlestad. One person was killed immediately, at least nine others were injured, and numerous homes were destroyed. Marine interests were also affected, as a large number of ferries were docked in the Baltic Sea. On September 18, a woman died of injuries. Her daughter died on February 7, 2006, after having been kept alive in a respirator since the accident.|$|E
5|$|More than 150 {{people were}} injured by the tornado outbreak, and one person was killed by straight-line {{thunderstorm}} winds. While tornado outbreaks {{in this area are}} unusual, <b>this</b> <b>storm</b> was especially rare in that it produced six significant tornadoes, two of which were violent F4s, and featured many tornadoes with tracks of several miles.|$|E

50|$|In both central Canada {{and central}} United States, cryoseisms (frost quakes) {{formed as a}} result of <b>this</b> ice <b>storm</b> were heard by a large number of people.|$|R
60|$|Had the Boers {{been the}} men of Colenso and of Spion Kop, <b>this</b> <b>storming</b> of Alleman's Nek {{would have been a}} bloody business. The {{position}} was strong, the cover was slight, {{and there was no way}} round. But the infantry came on with the old dash without the old stubborn resolution being opposed to them. The guns prepared the way, and then the Dorsets, the Dublins, the Middlesex, the Queen's, and the East Surrey did the rest. The door was open and the Transvaal lay before us. The next day Volksrust was in our hands.|$|R
5|$|Periods of rain {{impacted}} the British Isles {{early in}} the morning of 10 January, progressing from west to east. Wet and windy weather was seen across the region during the day, with a wintry mix of precipitation falling across northern sections of Britain. Within the area of wintry mix, the wind combined with the ongoing snowfall led to blizzards across most of Scotland. Precipitation became more showery in nature during the evening hours. Thunderstorms were observed despite the near-freezing temperature readings. Wind and waves associated with <b>this</b> <b>storm</b> were too much for the tanker MV Braer, which had become lodged on rocks in the Shetland Islands nearly a week beforehand. The tanker broke up and her remaining cargo of 84,500tons of light crude oil spilled into the ocean surrounding the islands. The rough conditions caused by <b>this</b> <b>storm</b> led to the rapid breakup of visible oil slicks.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{occurred during}} World War II, with activity from a German U-boat {{expected in the}} Gulf of Mexico. As a result, ship reports were silenced. At the time, the Weather Bureau relied primarily on ship and land weather station observations for issue storm warnings. Additionally, advisories had to be cleared through the Weather Bureau office in New Orleans, Louisiana, causing them to be released hours late; moreover the advisories contained no forecast information, which would have allowed for preparation before the storm struck. The news media after the hurricane was heavily censored by the government due to national security, as information could not be leaked to the Axis powers {{about the loss of}} production of war materials. Reportedly, the Federal Bureau of Investigation shut down a telegraph office in La Porte after a telegram was sent containing information about damage from the hurricane. The only news of <b>this</b> <b>storm</b> was published in Texas and Louisiana. After the loss of life in <b>this</b> <b>storm,</b> the Government of the United States has never censored hurricane advisories again.|$|E
5|$|The name Fefa {{was removed}} after <b>this</b> <b>storm</b> and {{replaced}} with Felicia in the 1997 season. The reason for the name retirement is unknown, as the storm itself caused little damage. Possible reasons listed {{for the removal of}} the name are pronunciation ambiguity, a socially unacceptable meaning in another language, or because the storm name represented a significant human disaster.|$|E
50|$|Wind {{damage was}} also a feature of <b>this</b> {{powerful}} <b>storm.</b> The 60-70 mph (100-120 km/h) winds damaged roofs, blew many trees down and caused a few buildings to collapse.|$|R
