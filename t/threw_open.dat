5|$|Sheriff Behan, testifying for the prosecution, {{said the}} Cowboys had not resisted, but had thrown {{up their hands}} and turned out their coats to show they were not armed. He said that Tom McLaury <b>threw</b> <b>open</b> his coat {{to show that he}} was not armed and that the first two shots were fired by the Earp party. Sheriff Behan insisted Doc Holliday had fired first using a {{nickel-plated}} revolver, although other witnesses reported seeing him carrying a messenger shotgun immediately beforehand.|$|E

He, England's first {{professional}} captain, was leading a triumphant team – in Australia!...He frowns on 'sleeping with the enemy' and counsels against our {{going into the}} Aussie dressing-room to fraternise with our affable opponents. In Melbourne, however, he could afford to be magnanimous. After the game he <b>threw</b> <b>open</b> {{the door of the}} English dressing room. The champagne flowed, flooding well into the night.|$|E
25|$|As {{the bidding}} went on, the {{soldiers}} reported {{to each of}} the two competitors, the one within the fortifications, the other outside the rampart, the sum offered by his rival. Eventually Sulpicianus promised 20,000 sesterces to every soldier; Julianus, fearing that Sulpicianus would gain the throne, then offered 25,000. The guards immediately closed with the offer of Julianus, <b>threw</b> <b>open</b> the gates, saluted him by the name of Caesar, and proclaimed him emperor. Threatened by the military, the senate declared him emperor. His wife and his daughter both received the title Augusta.|$|E

25|$|His next {{appointment}} was at Maharaja's College, Mysore as professor of History in 1913. He was then promoted as {{principal of the}} same college in 1916 and simultaneously appointed as Inspector General of Education in Mysore State. It was during this period that Reddy with great foresight <b>threw</b> <b>open</b> all the schools to Panchama children much against the local orthodox opposition. This was long before the days of Mahatma Gandhi's programme of temple entry for Harijans. Reddy is a revered name in Karnataka even today for this epoch-making step of social reform.|$|E
25|$|During this period, the World Bank and ITU {{had advised}} the Indian Government to liberalise long {{distance}} services {{to release the}} monopoly of the state owned DoT and VSNL and to enable competition in the long distance carrier business which would help reduce tariff's and better {{the economy of the}} country. The Rao run government instead liberalised the local services, taking the opposite political parties into confidence and assuring foreign involvement in the long distance business after 5 years. The country was divided into 20 telecommunication circles for basic telephony and 18 circles for mobile services. These circles were divided into category A, B and C depending on the value of the revenue in each circle. The government <b>threw</b> <b>open</b> the bids to one private company per circle along with government owned DoT per circle. For cellular service two service providers were allowed per circle and a 15 years licence was given to each provider. During all these improvements, the government did face oppositions from ITI, DoT, MTNL, VSNL and other labour unions, but they managed to keep away from all the hurdles.|$|E
2500|$|King Hussein {{declared}} {{martial law}} on 16 September and initiated the military actions later {{known as the}} Black September conflict. Hostage David Raab described the Jordanian military actions: [...] "We {{were in the middle}} of the shelling since Ashrafiyeh was among the Jordanian Army's primary targets. Electricity was cut off, and again we had little food or water. Friday afternoon, we heard the metal tracks of a tank clanking on the pavement. We were quickly herded into one room, and the guerrillas <b>threw</b> <b>open</b> the doors to make the building appear abandoned so it wouldn't attract fire. Suddenly, the shelling stopped." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Mexican {{bombardment}} {{continued through}} the morning of February 25. [...] At approximately 10 a.m. about 200300 Mexican soldiers, primarily cazadores from the Matamoros Battalion, crossed the San Antonio river and took cover in abandoned shacks approximately [...] to [...] from the Alamo walls. The Mexican soldiers were intending to use the huts as cover to erect another artillery battery, although many Texians assumed they were actually launching {{an assault on the}} fort. Travis called for volunteers to burn the huts, {{despite the fact that it}} was broad daylight and they would be within musket range of the Mexican soldiers. Charles Despallier, Robert Brown, James Rose and a few others volunteered for the mission. To provide cover, Dickinson and his men fired their 8-lb cannons, filled with grapeshot and canister, at the Mexican soldiers in the huts. Crockett and his men fired rifles, while other Texians reloaded extra weapons for them. Within two hours the battle was over. As soon as the Texians saw flames erupting from the huts they <b>threw</b> <b>open</b> the Alamo gate, and the Texians re-entered the Alamo, unscathed, although Rose was almost captured by a Mexican officer. The Mexican soldiers retreated, after six of their soldiers were killed and four wounded, while several Texians had been mildly scratched by flying rock.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the country}} agreed to pay all the usual taxes, but the Tudurs knew that they needed a {{bargaining}} chip {{if they were to}} lift the dire threat hanging over them. They decided to capture Edward I’s great castle at Conwy. Although the Conwy Castle garrison amounted to just fifteen men-at-arms and sixty archers, it was well stocked and easily reinforced from the sea; and in any case, the Tudurs only had forty men. On Good Friday, 1 April, all but five of the garrison were in the little church in the town when a carpenter appeared at the castle gate, who, according to Adam of Usk’s Chronicon, [...] "feigned to come for his accustomed work". Once inside, the Welsh carpenter attacked the two guards and <b>threw</b> <b>open</b> the gate to allow entry to the rebels. When Percy arrived from Denbigh with 120 men-at-arms and 300 archers, he knew it would take a great deal more to get inside so formidable a fortress and was forced to negotiate. A compromise was reached which would have resulted in pardons issued, but on 20 April, the king overruled Percy's local decision. It was not until Gwilym ap Tudur began to write directly to the king that an agreement was reached on 24 June. However, this was on the condition that nine of the defenders be turned over to justice.|$|E
