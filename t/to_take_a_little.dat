"In {{order to}} {{fine-tune}} Smash Bros., with this unprecedented game depth, {{we have decided}} that we have <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more time to complete the game than we announced before. We are sorry for the fans that are already anxiously waiting for the launch, but {{we would like to}} launch this game on January 24, 2008 in Japan. As for the North American launch, we will review that too, and our local subsidiaries will make their own announcements." ...|$|E
500|$|Connor Trinneer (who played Commander Trip Tucker), {{felt that}} the finale {{should have had a}} memorable {{farewell}} that he described as a [...] "M*A*S*H moment", but that the producers did not want to focus on such an element. Anthony Montgomery (who played Ensign Travis Mayweather) was similarly displeased with the finale and said [...] "I feel there could have been a more effective way to wrap things up for our show as well as the franchise as a whole. It just seemed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit away from what the Enterprise cast and crew worked so diligently to achieve over the past four years." [...] While Frakes enjoyed working with Sirtis again, he said that [...] "the reality is {{it was a bit of}} a stretch to have us shut down [...] show," [...] and that in hindsight it was a disservice to them. The early criticism forced the show's producers to hold a conference and address the issue. Braga admitted there was cast unrest, but defended the episode as a way to close not just Enterprise but Star Trek as a whole.|$|E
2500|$|A welterweight bout between former {{champion}} Robbie Lawler {{and former}} lightweight title challenger Donald Cerrone {{was the first}} confirmed bout of the event. However, {{just a few days}} after the announcement, it was revealed the Lawler decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more time to get ready for the fight after losing his title via knockout at UFC 201. He was replaced by [...] middleweight winner Kelvin Gastelum, who was scheduled to face Jorge Masvidal one week earlier than the event.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think we}} Western men who've come East are apt <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{ourselves}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too objectively {{and to feel}} ourselves rather more representative than we need," [...] March remarked.|$|R
2500|$|In a November 2011 interview, Dan Houser of Rockstar Games {{said that}} {{despite what the}} general public might think, Rockstar likes to [...] "spend a bit of time" [...] {{at the end of}} {{projects}} before deciding what to do next. [...] "Basically we have been meaning to start [...] for a while, but we have limited bandwidth and limited studios, and more games to make than we've started. So suddenly it was a good slot," [...] Houser said, explaining why it took eight years to follow up [...] [...] "Also, contrary to a lot of people, we like <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of time {{at the end of a}} game before starting a sequel, so we can wait for the excitement or disappointment and everything else of the experience to shake down and really see what we should do in the next game." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2011, in an {{interview}} with Gamasutra, Rockstar executive Dan Houser revealed the studio may focus on a sequel for Bully once Max Payne 3 is released. [...] "Contrary to a lot of people, we like <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of time {{at the end of a}} game before starting a sequel, so we can wait for the excitement or disappointment and everything else of the experience to shake down and really see what we should do in the next game," [...] he said. [...] "So we knew that we didn't want to start doing the Bully sequel instantly at that second with those guys -- even though it is a property that, like Max, we adore and might come back to in the future. There was just no impetus to do that then. So we said, 'You can do Max, and then we will see what we can do with Bully." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the abdication of the Tsar, the Yussupovs {{returned}} to the Moika Palace before going to Crimea. They later {{returned to}} the Palace to retrieve jewellery and two paintings by Rembrandt, the sale proceeds of which helped sustain the family in exile. In Crimea, the family boarded a British warship, HMS Marlborough, which took them from Yalta to Malta. Felix enjoyed boasting about killing Rasputin {{while he was on}} the ship. One of the British officers noted that Irina [...] "appeared shy and retiring at first, but it was only necessary <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> notice of her pretty, small daughter to break through her reserve and discover that she was also very charming and spoke fluent English". From there, they traveled to Italy and by train to Paris. In Italy, lacking a visa, Felix bribed the officials with diamonds. In Paris, they stayed a few days in Hôtel de Vendôme before they went on to London.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{pick up your}} {{goods and}} skip out!" [...] he cried, {{as he turned to}} the boy. [...] "And the next time you be careful how you disturb folks when they are trying <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> easy!" ...|$|R
50|$|D. {{began to}} venture into rapping as a hobby, making parodies to popular songs with his cousin. They began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{themselves}} <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more serious and formed a rap group with a few other close friends called the Starting Lineup.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of all things!" [...] {{burst out}} Laura. [...] "Say, Dave, will you ever settle down? Here I {{thought you were}} going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> nice <b>little</b> personally-conducted tour with us, and you talk of going land knows where to look for a lost gold mine!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Any romantic designs Clairmont {{might have}} had on Shelley were {{frustrated}} initially, but she did bring the Shelleys into contact with Lord Byron, with whom she entered into an affair before he left England in 1816 to live abroad. (A year marked by agricultural failures and widespread European famine, but also of significant literary advances as the Godwin-Shelley-Byron circle holed up indoors, 1816 would later {{be known as the}} [...] "year without a summer".) Clairmont hoped to become a writer or an actress and wrote to Byron asking for [...] "career advice" [...] in March 1816, when she was almost 18. Byron was a director at the Drury Lane Theatre. Clairmont later followed up her letters with visits, sometimes bringing Mary, whom she seemed to suggest Byron might also find attractive. [...] "Do you know I cannot talk to you when I see you? I am so awkward and only feel inclined <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> stool and sit at your feet," [...] Clairmont wrote to Byron. She [...] "bombarded him with passionate daily communiques" [...] telling him he need only accept [...] "that which it has long been the passionate wish of my heart to give you". She arranged for them to meet at a country inn. Byron, in a depressed state after the breakup of his marriage to Annabella Milbanke and the scandal over his relationship with his half-sister Augusta Leigh, made it very clear to Clairmont before he left that she would not be a part of his life. But she was determined to change his mind.|$|E

60|$|BROADBENT [not quite liking this]. My plan, sir, will be <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{money out}} of England and spend it in Ireland.|$|E
5000|$|Taylor felt [...] "it would've {{been nice}} for song [...] "Radio Prague" [...] <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more room" [...] as his purpose in {{choosing}} {{it was to}} [...] "change the mood {{at that point in}} the record", but felt the song seemed [...] "a little buried".|$|R
6000|$|John Burroughs, {{writing of}} Thoreau, says: [...] "He {{improves}} with age--in fact requires age <b>to</b> <b>take</b> off <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of his asperity, and fully ripen him. The world likes a good hater and refuser almost {{as well as}} it likes a good lover and accepter--only it likes him farther off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boy, I reckon {{you ought}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> that <b>a</b> <b>little</b> cheerfuller," [...] he went on. [...] "But--well it's been a hard time.... The men are leavin' now. In two hours the last wagons will unload at the railroad. The wheat {{will all be}} in the warehouse. An' our worry's ended." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{begged him}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> wine with me, and filled his glass till it burned like a ruby between their hands.|$|E

6000|$|... "Because you can’t" [...] said Captain Barber, emphatically. [...] "And no more can’t I {{get rid of}} ’er. You see, I ’appened <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{notice of}} ’er." ...|$|E
60|$|Lau. 'Twere a {{shame to}} quit my ground upon the first charge; yet if you please <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> truce <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> I will consent to go behind the lovers, and listen with you.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Easterfield smiled. He {{had really}} known the girl {{but for one}} day, for the first meeting did not count; {{and here he was}} {{defending}} the absolute beauty of her character. But the assumption of the genus young man often overtops the pyramids. She now determined <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more into her confidence.|$|R
6000|$|Gertrude {{made him}} the lowest of curtseys; for not <b>to</b> be <b>taken</b> for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> girl was the {{compliment}} she esteemed above all others. Dickie's next speech was, 'And is that Uncle Aubrey?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When you go," [...] {{she told}} him, [...] "I {{have made up}} my mind <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> holiday. I thought even of going to the South of France." ...|$|E
60|$|And he {{told them}} in the {{dormitory}} that he meant <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> holiday before his next crib, though a certain inherited reticence suppressed {{the fact of the}} legacy.|$|E
6000|$|I thought I {{had better}} leave the subject, and, [...] "By-the-way," [...] I said, [...] "how {{would you like}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tramp with me to-day farther up into the mountains?" ...|$|E
60|$|As for Eliphalet, he was {{beginning}} to like young Brice. He approved of any man from Boston who was not too squeamish <b>to</b> <b>take</b> pleasure in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> affair of this kind.|$|R
6000|$|... "You had better," [...] he said, {{looking at}} her with an ugly gleam in his eyes, [...] "persuade him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> you for <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tour on the Continent. It would be safer." ...|$|R
50|$|Audiobooks in India started <b>to</b> <b>take</b> shape <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{later as}} {{compared}} {{to the rest of the}} world. Only by 2010 did Audiobooks gain popularity in the Indian market. This is primarily due to lack of previous organized efforts on the part of publishers and authors. The marketing efforts and availability of Audiobooks has made India as one of the fastest growing Audiobooks markets in the world.|$|R
6000|$|Now, this is so--it {{is better}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{away at a}} [...] time and carry your staff with you, than to [...] take all at once and leave it behind.|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't {{be quite}} too horrid, Larry," [...] {{and there was}} a quiver in her voice. [...] "It wouldn't hurt you very much <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> thing like that from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’ll {{just keep}} my hand in," [...] said Captain Barber, thoughtfully. [...] "I can’t say as I find it disagreeable. I was always one <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{notice of the}} sects." ...|$|E
6000|$|But neither Josephine nor {{her young}} lady had any turn {{for what was}} [...] "triste."

6000|$|... "No; {{she thinks}} {{that it was an}} {{ordinary}} attack by robbers, and that the carriage was <b>to</b> <b>take</b> us <b>a</b> <b>little</b> way into the interior, so that they might hold us and demand a ransom. It was her own idea; I said nothing. I feel as though I were deceiving her, but I cannot tell her. She would never look upon your face again, Leonardo." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At least, it is {{scarcely}} likely <b>to</b> <b>take</b> place without <b>a</b> <b>little</b> judicious encouragement. The results, it is expected, would be repression and reprisal. It seems that a lenient native policy does not please everybody." ...|$|R
