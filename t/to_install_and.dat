5|$|Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) is an {{antivirus}} software (AV) product that provides protection against {{different types of}} malicious software such as computer viruses, spyware, rootkits and Trojan horses. Before version 4.5, MSE ran on , Windows Vista and Windows 7, but not on Windows 8 and later, which have built-in AV components. MSE 4.5 and later do not run on Windows XP. The license agreement allows home users and small businesses <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>and</b> use the product free of charge. It replaces Windows Live OneCare, a discontinued commercial subscription-based AV service, and the free Windows Defender, which until Windows 8 protected users from only adware and spyware.|$|E
5|$|These plugins {{are usually}} easy <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>and</b> can change almost {{everything}} in the game. Plugins can include new creatures, weapons, armor, quests, people, playable species, Easter eggs, stores, player-owned houses, cities, expand {{on the size of}} cities, and introduce new plotlines, and entire landmasses with {{some or all of the}} above. Organized projects, such as Tamriel Rebuilt and , attempt to recreate the originally envisioned Morrowind province and other parties of Tamriel, as seen in other The Elder Scrolls games. For example, there are interpretations of both Cyrodiil and Skyrim, the settings of later The Elder Scrolls games.|$|E
5|$|Though most {{computers}} since mid-2004 can boot from USB {{mass storage}} devices, USB {{is not intended}} as a primary bus for a computer's internal storage. Buses such as Parallel ATA (PATA or IDE), Serial ATA (SATA), or SCSI fulfill that role in PC class computers. However, USB has one important advantage, {{in that it is}} possible <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>and</b> remove devices without rebooting the computer (hot-swapping), making it useful for mobile peripherals, including drives of various kinds (given SATA or SCSI devices may or may not support hot-swapping).|$|E

5|$|On 28 October 2008, it was {{announced}} that the game would be released on Valve Corporation's content delivery system Steam on the official release date of 6 February; the game requires Steam <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>and</b> run for both retail and electronic versions and is integrated into Valve's Steamworks programme to allow updates and multiplayer to function more efficiently. The game's release was delayed in December 2008 to allow for the development of extended multiplayer features, with a new release date for March 2009. A demonstration of the game, featuring the Battle of Brandywine and the Battle of Lagos, was released over Steam on 20 February 2009. The game was released on 3 March 2009. Since release, Empire: Total War has been subject to updates delivered through the Steam system, aimed at optimising performance and removing any bugs remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|The Steam {{client was}} first made {{available}} for public beta testing in January 2003 during the beta period for Counter-Strike 1.6, {{for which it was}} mandatory <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>and</b> use. At the time, Steam's primary function was streamlining the patch process common in online computer games. Steam was an optional component for all other games. 80,000–300,000 gamers tested the system when it was in its beta period. The system and website choked under the strain of thousands of users simultaneously attempting to play the latest version of Counter-Strike. In 2004, the World Opponent Network was shut down and replaced by Steam. The online features of games which required World Opponent Network ceased to work unless they were converted to Steam.|$|E

25|$|For {{temporary}} railways {{that will}} be removed after short-term use, such as for construction, the logging industry, the mining industry, or large-scale construction projects, especially in confined spaces, such as the Channel Tunnel, a narrow-gauge railway is substantially cheaper and easier <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>and</b> remove. The use of such railways has almost vanished due to the capabilities of modern trucks.|$|E
25|$|More recently, in {{response}} to growing numbers of traffic accidents and speeding problems, cities across North America have begun creating traffic calming programs to improve safety and liveability on residential streets. Many municipalities create asphalt or concrete measures, although preformed rubber products that are easier <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>and</b> consistently meet standardized requirements are becoming increasingly popular. However, after two years, San Francisco's Vision Zero program, which heavily features traffic calming, failed to abate traffic fatalities.|$|E

25|$|The first PC {{operating}} systems to integrate such technology were Compaq DOS 3.31 (via CEMM) and Windows/386 2.1, both released in 1988. Since the 80286 version of Windows 2.0 (Windows/286), Windows applications {{did not suffer}} from the 640 KB barrier. Prior to DOS extenders, if a user installed additional memory and wished to use it under DOS, they would first have <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>and</b> configure drivers to support either expanded memory specification (EMS) or extended memory specification (XMS).|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the easiest}} face vise to install is the {{self-contained}} iron vise, {{sometimes called the}} 'quick-action' vise (except they are not all quick-action). This tool comes already assembled and only has to be mounted to the bench. Usually, auxiliary wooden jaws are added. The quick-action feature makes setting it much quicker and is quickly taken for granted. Not only are these vises easy <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>and</b> use, they are also robust. Their main drawback is the relatively high cost.|$|E
25|$|A newer form of tail vise does {{away with}} the need of a frame. It uses steel plates for its {{structure}} - one steel plate with the nut is mounted {{on the side of}} the bench, two others are built into a sliding jaw along with the bench screw. This is a robust design and it's easier <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>and</b> adjust than the older style. However, only a few sizes are commercially available (although larger sizes have been custom made).|$|E

The purpose of the facility is to arrive at an optimal design for OTEC heat exchangers, increasing performance and useful life while reducing cost (heat exchangers being the #1 cost driver for an OTEC plant). And in March 2013, Makai announced an award <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>and</b> operate a 100 kilowatt turbine on the OTEC Heat Exchanger Test Facility, and once again connect OTEC power to the grid.|$|E
25|$|A smart TV {{device is}} either a {{television}} set with integrated Internet capabilities or a set-top box for television that offers more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a contemporary basic television set. Smart TVs may {{be thought of as}} an information appliance or the computer system from a handheld computer integrated within a television set unit, as such a smart TV often allows the user <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>and</b> run more advanced applications or plugins/addons based on a specific platform. Smart TVs run a complete operating system or mobile operating system software providing a platform for application developers.|$|E
25|$|Air source {{heat pumps}} are {{relatively}} easy and inexpensive <b>to</b> <b>install</b> <b>and</b> have therefore historically {{been the most}} widely used heat pump type. However, they suffer limitations due to their use of the outside air as a heat source. The higher temperature differential during periods of extreme cold leads to declining efficiency. In mild weather, COP may be around 4.0, while at temperatures below around 0°C (32°F) an air-source heat pump may still achieve a COP of 2.5. The average COP over seasonal variation is typically 2.5-2.8, with exceptional models able to exceed this in mild climates.|$|E
