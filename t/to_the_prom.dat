Therefore, Homer pretends to be a French student so that he can be tutored by Marge and when Homer asks Marge to the senior prom she accepts. However, when Homer confesses that he is not really a French student, Marge is furious at him for making her lose sleep for a debate tournament the next morning. She ultimately loses to Artie, who asks her to be his partner to the prom; she agrees. Homer does not realize that Marge has changed her plans, and so he shows up at her house for prom night to pick her up. Moments later Artie shows up, causing confusion to Marge's family, and a despondent Homer leaves. Undaunted, he decides to go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prom</b> alone.|$|E

5|$|To prove {{she is able}} {{to handle}} her own affairs, Serena refuses to leave jail with either Lily or CeCe (Caroline Lagerfelt) {{although}} Lily drops the charges on which she had Serena arrested. Rufus (Matthew Settle) is also angry with Lily for Serena's arrest; Dan (Penn Badgley) and Jenny (Taylor Momsen) inform Vanessa (Jessica Szohr) that Rufus returned home without proposing to Lily, and he has remained in his bedroom ever since. Lily feuds with CeCe for telling Rufus about their lovechild. From jail, Serena encourages Blair (Leighton Meester) to enjoy prom with Nate (Chace Crawford) in the way Blair had chronicled in a scrapbook as a preteen, but each of the couple’s prom plans, such as the limo, hotel reservation and Blair's dress, inexplicably go awry.

At Nationals, as the New Directions are about to go on stage, Finn begs Rachel to get back together with him, but though she professes her love, she refuses, still torn between her love for New York and Broadway and her love for him. At the end of their duet—"Pretending", written by Finn—an enthusiastic audience falls silent when Rachel and Finn share an overlong, unscripted kiss; the glee club comes in twelfth. Back in Ohio, Finn reminds Rachel that she has a year until graduation and any move to New York; he kisses her, and their relationship resumes.|$|E

Kat confesses to Bianca that she dated Joey when they were freshmen and, succumbing to peer pressure, had sex with him. Afterward she regretted it and Joey dumped her, so she vowed to never again do anything just because everyone else was doing it. Bianca insists that she can make her own choices, so Kat agrees to go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prom</b> with Patrick, and Bianca decides to go with Cameron instead of Joey.|$|E

500|$|... "The Way We Was" [...] is {{the twelfth}} episode of The Simpsons second season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox {{network in the}} United States on January 31, 1991. In the episode, Marge {{tells the story of}} how she and Homer first met and fell in love. Flashing back to 1974, we see how Homer falls in love with Marge in high school and tries to get close to her by enlisting her as his French tutor. After several hours of verb conjugation, Marge falls for Homer too, only to become enraged when he admits that he is not a French student.

500|$|The {{television}} {{show that the}} Simpson family watches {{at the beginning of}} the episode, in which the two reviewers discuss the latest McBain film, is a parody of the American television series Siskel & Ebert & the Movies. In the flashback sequence, Homer is seen singing along to the 1973 song [...] "The Joker" [...] by the Steve Miller Band while driving to school. Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin posters hang on the wall of Homer's 1974 bedroom. The 1970 song [...] "(They Long to Be) Close to You" [...] by The Carpenters is heard when Homer sees Marge for the first time. Homer eats a bucket of Shakespeare Fried Chicken when he reveals his feelings towards Marge to Grampa. At the debate, Homer disagrees about the idea of lowering the United States national speed limit to 55mph (90km/h), arguing that [...] "Sure, it'll save a few lives, but millions will be late!" [...] This is a reference to the National Maximum Speed Law provision of the 1974 Emergency Highway Energy Conservation Act that prohibited speed limits higher than 55mph. Barney asks a girl named Estelle if she wants to go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prom</b> with him, but she tells him that she would not go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prom</b> with him even if he were American actor Elliott Gould. Artie says he can think of a dozen highly cogent arguments to why Marge should accept his prom offer, one of which is from a Time magazine titled [...] "America's Love Affair with the Prom: Even wallflowers can look forward to one date a year," [...] a reference to the American magazine Time. Songs played in the episode include [...] "The Streak" [...] by Ray Stevens , [...] "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" [...] by Elton John, [...] "Colour My World" [...] by Chicago, [...] "Pick Up the Pieces" [...] by Average White Band, and [...] "The Hustle" [...] by Van McCoy.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, as {{a measure}} of {{objective}} functional impairment in lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD), complements patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of subjective functional impairment. METHODS Prospective two-center study on consecutive patients scheduled for surgical treatment for lumbar DDD who underwent an objective (TUG test) and subjective (PROMs) functional assessment before, as well as one and three days after surgery. <b>PROMs</b> included <b>the</b> Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Roland-Morris Disability Index (RMDI), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Euro-Qol (EQ- 5 D) and Short Form (SF) - 12 questionnaires. Upon completion of each assessment, patients were asked whether they would prefer performing the TUG test or completing <b>the</b> <b>PROMs</b> questionnaires. RESULTS A total of n= 109 / 125 patients (87. 2 %) completed the assessments. Preoperatively, patients were 2. 18 times as likely <b>to</b> prefer <b>the</b> TUG test <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>PROMs</b> (OR 2. 18, 95 %CI 1. 27 - 3. 75). On postoperative days one and three, patients were 5. 79 (OR 5. 79, 95 %CI 3. 23 - 10. 37) and 6. 33 times as likely <b>to</b> prefer <b>the</b> TUG test <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>PROMs,</b> respectively (OR 6. 33, 95 %CI 3. 51 - 11. 41). There were no statistical differences in baseline characteristics, TUG t-scores, VAS, RMDI, ODI, SF- 12 and EQ- 5 D index between patients preferring either the TUG test or <b>the</b> <b>PROMs</b> questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS <b>The</b> TUG test is preferred over a battery of PROMs by 60 - 70 % of patients with lumbar DDD not only in the preoperative, but also in the postoperative setting. High functional disability does not result in avoidance of the TUG test and repeated assessments lead to higher preference...|$|R

500|$|Rhimes {{entitled}} the episode [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] {{because she felt}} [...] "that {{is what happens to}} each intern in this episode.

And that leads to her letting go of medicine. Alex lets go of his rage against Izzie. And Meredith... well, Meredith just lets go." [...] The costumes were designed by Mimi Melgaard; Rhimes noted that everyone was dressed in dark funeral colors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prom,</b> except Stevens who was dressed in pink. Stevens' dress was an Amsale creation. Monologues done by the five main characters were used in this episode. Rhimes commented: [...] "this was something we'd never done and I wasn't sure would work. But you place those pages {{into the hands of the}} actors and each and every one of them layered their characters' souls right into the dialogue." [...] The episode's theme was the prom; Rhimes said she wanted to do it since the beginning of the season.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons uses a {{floating}} timeline {{in which the}} characters do not physically age, and as such the show is generally assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events {{have been linked to}} specific time periods, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Marge Simpson is the wife of Homer and mother of Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. She was raised by her parents, Jacqueline and Clancy Bouvier. She has a pair of sisters, the joyless Patty and Selma, both of whom vocally disapprove of Homer. In [...] "The Way We Was" [...] (season two, 1991), it is revealed via flashback that Marge attended Springfield High School, and in her final year met Homer Simpson. She was at first wary of Homer, but agreed to go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prom</b> with him, although she ended up going with Artie Ziff. However, she regretted going with Artie and ended up with Homer, a decision solidified when she heard Jackie and Clancy voicing their negative opinions on Homer. After the two had been dating for several years, Marge discovered she was pregnant with Bart, and she and Homer were married in a small wedding chapel across the state line. Bart was born soon after, and the couple bought their first house. The episode [...] "That '90s Show" [...] (season 19, 2008) contradicted much of the established back-story; for example, it was revealed that Marge and Homer were childless in the early 1990s although past episodes had suggested Bart and Lisa were born in the 1980s.|$|E

30|$|There {{are a few}} {{limitations}} to our study. In 37 of 138 patients treated for SCFE between 1980 and 2002 in four hospitals, no information could be found on severity of the slip, and these patients therefore had to be excluded, leaving 101 potential patients for the study. Despite extended efforts to reach and motivate all patients <b>to</b> complete <b>the</b> <b>PROMs</b> and/or visit <b>the</b> outpatient clinic for radiological follow-up, only 68 patients (67  %) committed <b>to</b> completing <b>the</b> <b>PROMs</b> or making <b>the</b> follow-up X-rays. Gender and age at surgery were equal in the patients who entered the study and the patients who did not. Patients who completed <b>the</b> <b>PROMs</b> had a longer follow-up and a higher Southwick angle than patients who did not. This last feature {{can be explained by}} the fact that some of the patients we called <b>to</b> participate in <b>the</b> study did not want to do so because they had no functional problems of the hip.

Lana's jealousy over Clark and Chloe going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>prom</b> begins to come out; although Kristin Kreuk believes that Lana {{does not want to be}} jealous, and wants to be able to support Clark with his newfound feelings for Chloe. According to Eric Johnson, Whitney finally gets to show a side of himself that Johnson wishes the audience would have been able to see sooner, as Whitney gives Lana a private dance before the prom knowing that she will not be able to go because he is leaving town. To add further depth to his character not previously seen, Millar and Gough decided to send Whitney off to war, instead of killing the character outright. The idea of sending Whitney off to war was something that came to Millar and Gough midway through the season. They knew they did not want to kill him, because they wanted the ability to bring him back at some point in the future, so they came up with this [...] "noble, heroic, send-off" [...] for the character. For Lex, this episode featured the moment when he finally began to contemplate what his life would be like if his father was no longer a part of it. As Rosenbaum sees it, the moment that Lex hesitates to free his father from the support beam that collapses on him is the moment that the audience gets to see a hint of the evil man they know Lex will one day become. This is a brief moment where Lex forgets who he is, and if he had let his father die he would have certainly made his [...] "turn to the dark side".|$|E
