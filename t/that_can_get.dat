5|$|The Dorset is {{an ancient}} breed that was most likely {{developed}} from horned sheep that lived in the valleys and pastures of southwestern England. Dorset Horn sheep were imported into the United States in 1860, and the first U.S. national flock book was formed in 1891. Today, the Dorset is found in two varieties globally, Horned and Polled. In the Horn variety, both ewes and rams have horns, while the polled variety have no horns at all. Polled Dorsets are ideal for commercial settings {{because they do not}} have horns <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> caught in fencing or cause damage when they butt.|$|E

Lennon and Ono pledged to auction the shorn hair for a charitable cause, having similarly announced on 5 January that they would donate all future royalties from their recordings to the peace movement. Also while in Denmark, the Lennons, Cox and the latter's current partner, Melinde Kendall, discussed the concept of [...] "instant karma", whereby the causality of one's actions is immediate rather than borne out over a lifetime. Author Philip Norman writes of the concept's appeal: [...] "The idea was quintessential Lennon – the age-old Buddhist law {{of cause and effect}} turned into something as modern and synthetic as instant coffee and, simultaneously, into a bogey under the stairs <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> you if you don't watch out." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Not on Drugs" [...] is {{the opening}} track on Tove Lo's debut {{extended}} play, Truth Serum. According to the artist, {{the songs on}} the EP talk about her [...] "most intense" [...] failed relationship from beginning to end, which started [...] "really happy and passionate". Following the narrative of Truth Serum, the track conveys the time when Lo was [...] "really {{in love with someone}} and [...] think straight" [...] and felt [...] "high" [...] all the time. She also stated that she wanted to write a happy and euphoric song that represented the positive beginning of her relationships, since most of her tracks are about the decay of them. In an interview with MTV UK, the artist said, [...] "'Not On Drugs' is, like many of my songs so far, about love. At least it's about the happy kind of love where you feel like there's nothing <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> you higher than the person you're with and have these feelings for". [...] "Not on Drugs" [...] was also included in [...] "The Love" [...] section of Lo's debut studio record, Queen of the Clouds, a concept album that describes the pattern of the singer's relationships.|$|E

500|$|Even before {{viewing the}} script, Reznor and Ross opted {{to use a}} redolent {{approach}} to creating the film's score. After discussing with Fincher the varying soundscapes and emotions, the duo spent six weeks composing. [...] "We composed music we felt might belong," [...] stated the Nine Inch Nails lead vocalist, [...] "and then we'd run it by Fincher, to see where his head’s at and he responded positively. He was filming at {{this time last year}} and assembling rough edits of scenes to see what it feels like, and he was inserting our music at that point, rather than using temp music, which is how it usually takes place, apparently." [...] Finding a structure for the soundtrack was arguably the most strenuous task. [...] "We weren’t working on a finished thing, so everything keeps moving around, scenes are changing in length, and even the order of things are shuffled around, and <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> pretty frustrating when you get precious about your work. It was a lesson we learned pretty quickly of, 'Everything is in flux, and approach it as such. Hopefully it’ll work out in the end.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Walter Afanasieff, long-time Mariah Carey collaborator, {{worked with}} Simpson on three cuts from Irresistible. One of the songs, [...] "When You Told Me You Loved Me", {{was written by}} Afanasieff in {{collaboration}} with Billy Mann. In an interview with Allpop, Simpson named the song {{as one of her}} favorites and said, [...] "I really base that on a situation of a friend of mine whose parents are divorced. I like the emotion behind that song." [...] Cory Rooney wrote [...] "Hot Like Fire" [...] solely, which Simpson described as [...] "certainly not kid stuff", a song [...] "with a lot of attitude." [...] Louis Biancaniello and Sam Watters were also brought in to write and produce songs for the album. One of the cuts, [...] "For Your Love", according to Simpson, is reminiscent of [...] "I Wanna Love You Forever" [...] (1999). Simpson covered the gospel hymn [...] "His Eye is on the Sparrow" [...] as the last song of the album. She said, [...] "I wanted to give my audience a piece of my heart and soul. The message is there's so much in life <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> you discouraged, but if you trust that you're being watched over, you have a reason to live and a sense of freedom. It's different for everyone, but for me, my relationship with God is the way I clear out the shadows that hang in our lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mad Men has {{encouraged}} much discussion about gender. The show presents a subculture in which men, {{many of whom}} are engaged or married, frequently enter sexual relationships with other women. Most of the main characters have strayed outside of their marriages. Marie Wilson, in an op-ed for The Washington Post said that [...] "it is difficult and painful to see the ways in which women and men dealt {{with each other and with}} power. It's painful because this behavior is not as far back in our past as we would like to think. Our daughters continually get the messages that power still comes through powerful men. And unfortunately being pretty is still a quality <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> you on the ladder—though it still won't take you to the top." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Wii Zapper is a gun shell {{accessory}} for the Wii Remote. As {{shown in}} the image, the shell receives both the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, and contains a trigger that actuates the Wii Remote's B button; all other buttons are still accessible while the remote and Nunchuk are in the shell. The name is {{a reference to the}} NES Zapper light gun for the Nintendo Entertainment System. According to an interview with Shigeru Miyamoto, the idea of a Zapper-type expansion formed when the Wii Remote was first created. He expressed that [...] "What we found is that the reason we wanted to have a Zapper is when you hold a Wii Remote, it can be difficult for some people to keep a steady hand. And holding your arm out like <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> your arm somewhat tired."

The Wall Street Journal said, [...] "Walking with Dinosaurs... is the only new release targeted at children {{and is expected to}} appeal primarily to young ones."

2500|$|Chardonnay was {{believed}} to be first planted in Chablis by the Cistercians at Pontigny Abbey in the 12th century. Today, the Chardonnay made in the Chablis region is one of the [...] "purest" [...] expression of the varietal character of the grape due to the simplistic style of winemaking favored in this region. Chablis winemakers want to emphasise the terroir of the calcareous soil and cooler climate that help maintain high acidity. The wines rarely go through malolactic fermentation or are exposed to oak (though its use is increasing). The biting, green apple-like acidity is a trademark of Chablis and can be noticeable in the bouquet. The acidity can mellow with age and Chablis are some of the longest-living examples of Chardonnay. Some examples of Chablis can have an earthy [...] "wet stone" [...] flavor <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> mustier as it ages before mellowing into delicate honeyed notes. The use of oak is controversial in the Chablis community, with some winemakers dismissing it as counter to the [...] "Chablis style" [...] or terroir, while others embrace its use, though not to the length that would characterise a [...] "New World" [...] Chardonnay. The winemakers who use oak tend to favor more neutral oak that does not impart the vanilla characteristic associated with American oak. The amount of [...] "" [...] in the barrel is often very light, which limits the amount of [...] "toastiness" [...] perceived in the wine. The advocates of oak in Chablis point to the positive benefits of allowing limited oxygenation with the wine through the permeable oak barrels. This can have the effect of softening the wine and making the generally austere and acidic Chablis more approachable at a younger age.|$|E
2500|$|NME {{considered}} it a [...] "comeback single" [...] for the [...] "pop queen". CNN called it a [...] "pleasing single", also labeled [...] "peppy, radio-perfect" [...] and [...] "funky fun". Entertainment Weekly {{considered it}} [...] "competent hack-pop", and Newsday declared the song [...] "breathy" [...] and [...] "carefree". The former publication also exclaimed the song [...] "delivers", adding it [...] "slides nicely from a half-time, stutter-beat verse to a memorably singsongy chorus, on which Janet's restrained cooing lets the melody do all the work." [...] In a later anecdote, it was described as [...] "Bacharachian" [...] as well as [...] "peppy" [...] and [...] "cute", commending its [...] "bells and whistles in the production" [...] and Jackson's [...] "falsetto trill". MTV News labeled it [...] "a return to Jackson's more melodic, pop side and {{a departure from the}} more groove-based The Velvet Rope." [...] Vibe called it [...] "blissful" [...] with a [...] "bright, shiny sound", and MacKenzie Wilson of AllMusic considered it [...] "sweet upbeat" [...] and a large contrast from other songs on the film's soundtrack. It was also considered [...] "a less suffocating shade of pop" [...] for radio, both [...] "blippy" [...] and [...] "joyful". Film magazine Empire called it [...] "soulful hip-pop" [...] and [...] "popcorn for the ears", likened to [...] "vodka on the rocks" [...] for its [...] "Pepsi commercial" [...] semblance. Furthermore, Jeff Stark of Salon declared it as [...] "skittery" [...] and [...] "subdued", and Slant Magazine described it as laced with [...] "minimal percussive programming".
