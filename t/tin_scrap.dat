His second patent was on a process for purifying paraffin wax in 1876. Both of these became important to industry. Paraffin wax was formerly a waste by-product in oil refining, but with his invention, it became capable of utilization {{in the manufacture of}} candles and for other industrial purposes. He also developed paraffin paper, which had great and varied uses as a waterproof packing material for foodstuffs, confectionery, etc., and made possible the safe transportation and preservation of many substances, otherwise perishable. Other earlier inventions were connected with the production of oil, salt, and white lead.|$|E
40|$|The {{tin metal}} could be {{retractable}} from wasted <b>tin</b> <b>scrap,</b> sludge, and wasted electroplated solution hydrometallurgical treatment, and purification process. In {{order to be}} used as resource of electronic devices, the retracted crude metal should be purified to the extent of higher than 99. 9 %. In this study, tin electro-refining process was performed to purify the casted tin crude metal at various experimental conditions: at the current density of 3, 5 A/dm 2, and in various electrolytes such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and methansulfonic acid. Additional experiment was conducted using Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE) in order to investigate the rate determining step of tin electro-refining process. The current efficiency, 65. 6 %, was achievable at the condition of current density, 5 A/dm 2, and in the electrolyte of Hydrochloric acid. During tin electro-refining process, impurity dissolved from tin crude metal into the electrolyte was analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES), and the result showed the concentration of impurity metal gradually increased. Quantitative analysis on casted tin crude metal showed that it consists of tin with 93. 9 wt. % and several impurity metals of Ag, Bi, Pb, Cu, and etc. After tin electro-refining process, the purity of tin increased up to 99. 985 wt. %...|$|E

50|$|Analysis of {{the source}} of copper used in the {{manufacture}} of Egyptian blue indicates a relationship with the contemporaneous metal industry. Whereas in the earlier periods, it is most probable that copper ores were used, during the reign of Tutmosis III, the copper ore is replaced by the use of bronze filings. This has been established by the detection of a specific amount of tin oxide in Egyptian blue which could only have resulted from the use of <b>tin</b> bronze <b>scraps</b> as the source of copper, which coincides with the time when bronze became widely available in ancient Egypt.|$|R

40|$|The indium <b>tin</b> oxide <b>scrap</b> (ITOS) was {{mechanically}} {{activated by}} a stirring ball mill and subsequently studied for the leaching behavior and kinetics of extracting indium from ITOS in hydrochloric acid solution. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) {{analysis showed that}} MA caused the decrease in crystalline phase and increase in lattice distortion. The effects of reaction temperature and hydrochloric acid concentration on the leaching rate of indium were also investigated, which showed that the indium extraction from ITOS had significant dependency on temperature and HCl concentration. The equal-recovery method was used for kinetics analysis. When ITOS was mechanically activated for 15 and 30 min, the apparent activation energy decreased from 90. 6 kJ/mol to 70. 3 and 53. 0 kJ/mol, respectively, which indicated that MA could enhance the reactivity of ITOS and accelerated the reaction. The reaction orders of extracting indium from the nonactivated, milled for 15 and 30 min ITOS with respect to HCl concentration were 2. 30, 1. 44, and 1. 31, respectively...|$|R
5000|$|Returning to the East by 1870, {{he became}} a {{respected}} New York City chemist and began experimenting with electricity. He operated nickel plating works in Newark and patented a method to remove <b>tin</b> from <b>scrap,</b> patented in 1876.

He was active in professional organizations, being a co-founder of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers and editor and founder of Electronic World. At {{the same time he}} authored Magnetic and Dynamo-Electric Machines (1884) and translated German texts on electric motors. Lured West again, in 1884 he built the first electric plant for San Francisco. Between 1884 and 1893 he {{was among the first to}} apply electricity to mining, especially electro-metallurgy. Located in San Francisco he served as consultant to mining companies across the West. He would also patent several more pieces of mine machinery (a ball crusher [...] "Keith Pulverizer") and amalgamation equipment (the commonly used centrifugal electrical amalgamation machine). In San Francisco, he also sold electric motors to meet burgeoning demand, but sold out with the crash of 1893.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As the {{extension}} of mineral processing, recycling metals from wastes {{is very important for}} a sustainable society. We have been working on mechanochemistry and its engineering applications. One of the applications is to recover and separate useful components from different kinds of wastes emitted in our society. When a waste sample is subjected to grinding in air so called mechanical treatment, it changes its structure to disordered system, resulting in chemical reactions with other substances when it takes over the certain level of energy. Depending on the existing states of target elements in the wastes, mechanical activation and mechanochemical (MC) reaction can be applied for the recycling of useful compositions and a process based on MC treatment has been developed. We will report several examples from our research experiences at the conference. The first example is to recover rare earths from fluorescent powders in waste lamps. The waste is firstly subjected to dry grinding to cause amorphization of their structures. This amorphization makes it possible to dissolve the rare earths from the waste at high yield by leaching with mild acid solution at room temperature. Similar phenomenon {{can be seen in the}} case of ITO (indium <b>tin</b> oxide) <b>scrap</b> when it is ground, followed by leaching with acid solution. In this case, dry grinding the scra...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVery {{little is}} known about early {{metallurgical}} activity in the north-western part of the Arabian Peninsula, despite the region's cultural importance. To begin to address this research lacuna, metallurgical remains including crucible fragments, metal dross and a copper artefact were sampled from two oases in northwest Arabia, Qurayyah and Tayma. The metallurgical activity in Qurayyah is dated to the Late Bronze Age, and in Tayma to the Roman/Late Roman period. At both sites we identified evidence for copper alloying and refining. Small scale copper smelting might also have been practiced in Qurayyah. Arsenical copper was processed at both sites, but in Tayma tin bronze and leaded tin bronze dominated. The chemical analysis of metal prills in crucible linings showed that fresh copper and <b>tin</b> instead of <b>scrap</b> metal were employed in these processes. Lead isotope analysis indicates {{that at least some of}} the Tayma metal was imported. Access to raw materials from remote areas is consistent with the importance of Tayma in the trading network of northwest Arabia...|$|R
40|$|Lead-free solders used in {{electronic}} components are predominately composed of alloys rich in tin. Significant quantities of partially oxidized tin alloy are generated during typical processing operations. The scrap {{has generally been}} considered to be tin oxide and suitable for recovery using electrolysis or reduction with charcoal and fuel oil at temperatures above 1000 °C. This experimental work examines alternative processes for the recovery of metallic <b>tin</b> from this <b>scrap.</b> Microstructural and chemical characterisation of the scrap revealed that metallic tin was the predominant phase and {{was surrounded by a}} cover layer of tin oxide ranging in thickness from a few μm (micrometres) to 100 μm. It was shown that even the thin layer of tin oxide prevented the coalescence of the metallic tin and inhibited recovery. It was concluded that removal of the oxide layer is the key step required in recovering the metal. The removal of the tin oxide was attempted using mechanical attrition (grinding in a ball mill) and chemical dissolution of the tin oxide layer by means of hydrochloric acid (HCl). The results of attrition in a ball mill indicated that the tin oxide covering layer was effectively reduced from the material over 53 μm and the removed oxide was concentrated in particles less than this size. Furthermore, the remaining tin oxide layer can be almost completely removed by an acidic treatment with 2 M HCl at room temperature and agitation for 30 min. A flow sheet for the recovery of the metallic tin is presented below based on the obtained experimental results...|$|R
