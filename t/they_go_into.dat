A man dressed in a black, hooded coat appears and directs Sora towards a massive {{fortress}} called Castle Oblivion. Upon entering, the travelers realize that they have forgotten all of their abilities. The hooded man explains that the deeper <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the castle, the more memories they will lose, but they will also uncover new memories in the process. He creates {{a deck of cards}} made from Sora's and his friends' memories, and tells them that everything they encounter in this castle will be based on their memories.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} multiple endings. During {{the original}} playthrough, if Class Zero accept the Vermillion Bird Crystal's offer {{for them to}} become l'Cie, <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> battle against the Rursus and die, dooming Orience to be destroyed in Tempus Finis and reborn in another spiral of history. In a sequence unlocked during the second playthrough, it is revealed that Cid wanted to free Orience from the Crystals' control, and killed himself in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent Gala from using him. After the Arbiter's defeat, Joker and Tiz speak with Arecia and show her the memories of Class Zero {{and the people of}} Orience to make her reconsider restarting the experiment. After speaking with Machina and Rem, Arecia decides to abandon the experiment and returns the two to human form. In an alternate ending, Arecia chooses to remove the crystals from Orience's history, creating a new timeline where the war never occurred and the world's population can live happily.|$|E

25|$|They can be {{difficult}} pets to care for, requiring regular attention and a very specific diet of grasses and hay. Each year, <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> a period called rut that can last for several months, in which their personalities can drastically change, often becoming defensive or even aggressive. Despite their needs, prairie dogs are very social animals and come to seem as though they treat humans as members of their colony, answering barks and chirps, and even coming when called by name.|$|E

25|$|According to Zbigniew Dumienski, {{the very}} concept of human {{trafficking}} is murky and misleading. It has been argued that while human trafficking is commonly seen as a monolithic crime, in reality it is an act of illegal migration that involves various different actions: some of them may be criminal or abusive, but others often involve consent and are legal. Laura Agustin argues that not everything that might seem abusive or coercive is considered as such by the migrant. For instance, she states that: 'would-be travellers commonly seek help from intermediaries who sell information, services and documents. When travellers cannot afford to buy these outright, <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> debt'. Dumienski says that while these debts might indeed be on very harsh conditions, they are usually incurred on a voluntary basis.|$|E
25|$|The ACNA is a conciliar {{church where}} both clergy and laity {{participate}} in church governance. Every five years, between 250 and 300 diocesan delegates meet {{as a representative}} body called the Provincial Assembly. Each diocese is represented by its bishop, two clergy delegates, and two lay delegates. In addition, a diocese receives one additional clergy delegate and one additional lay delegate for every 1,000 constituents, calculated by average attendance at Sunday church services. Dioceses also send youth representatives {{between the ages of}} 16 and 26, and these representatives have full voting rights. The Provincial Assembly must approve all constitutional amendments and new canons before <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> effect. Other duties of the assembly include deliberating on church affairs and making recommendations to the provincial governing bodies on such matters.|$|E
25|$|When {{a person}} drinks the Draught of Living Death, <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> {{a deep sleep}} so strong that {{they appear to be}} dead, hence the name. It is made from {{powdered}} root of asphodel which is added to an infusion of wormwood, and was first mentioned in Harry's first potions lesson with Snape in Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone. It was later mentioned in his first Potions lesson with Horace Slughorn in Half-Blood Prince when Harry receives top marks in Horace Slughorn's first NEWT (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests) Potions class for brewing this potion so well, having used the handwritten advice in the Half-Blood Prince's book. He is then awarded a small bottle of the potion Felix Felicis as a prize. This potion is described as changing in colour during the process of being made. It has a texture and consistency akin to that of clear water. A process of examining the potency of the potion is to drop a new or fresh leaf in it – the leaf is instantaneously reduced to ashes.|$|E

25|$|The {{germination}} percentage {{is simply the}} proportion of seeds that germinate from all seeds subject to the right conditions for growth. The germination rate is {{the length of time}} it takes for the seeds to germinate. Germination percentages and rates are affected by seed viability, dormancy and environmental effects that impact on the seed and seedling. In agriculture and horticulture quality seeds have high viability, measured by {{germination percentage}} plus the rate of germination. This is given as a percent of germination over a certain amount of time, 90% germination in 20 days, for example. 'Dormancy' is covered above; many plants produce seeds with varying degrees of dormancy, and different seeds from the same fruit can have different degrees of dormancy. It's possible to have seeds with no dormancy if they are dispersed right away and do not dry (if the seeds dry <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> physiological dormancy). There is great variation amongst plants and a dormant seed is still a viable seed even though the germination rate might be very low.|$|E
25|$|The Bombardier ART {{model has}} {{undergone}} several redesigns {{from the original}} UTDC ICTS model, and the Mark II design has been updated by Bombardier, with this newest offering being the Innovia Metro 300. Dimensions {{are similar to the}} Mark II, with capacity improvements offered over the outgoing model through redesigned car layout. TransLink ordered 28 Mark III cars, which began delivery in 2015, and went into service beginning in August 2016. The vehicles appear sleeker, with larger windows {{on the sides of the}} train, and redesigned windows and headlights on the ends of the cars. The interior is largely similar to the second generation of Mark II cars, with the some seats removed to better accommodate bicycles and strollers. TransLink has claimed that the interior of the Mark III offers better sound and heat insulation. TransLink ordered the cars for the Evergreen Extension in a 4-car articulated configuration, with two centre cars, to allow full length train movements by passengers. However, due to a shortage of trains, the Mark IIIs are being used on the Expo Line, while 2-car Innovia 200 (Mk2) serve the Millennium Line. On December 16, 2016, TransLink ordered 28 more Mark III cars, which will bring the total number of Mark III cars to 56 once <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> service in early 2019.|$|E

As a result, <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> a time warp, {{experiencing}} a [...] "living death" [...] where time passes in a nonlinear fashion, and are unable to return to Earth. The whole band helped with the arrangement, coming up with musical themes to match the lyrical theme of isolation and fear.|$|E

500|$|For {{women with}} {{injuries}} above T6, a risk during labor and delivery that threatens {{both mother and}} fetus is autonomic dysreflexia, in which the blood pressure increases to dangerous levels high enough to cause potentially deadly stroke. Drugs such as nifedipine and captopril {{can be used to}} manage an episode if it occurs, and epidural anesthesia helps although it is not very reliable in women with SCI. [...] Anesthesia is used for labor and delivery even for women without sensation, who may only experience contractions as abdominal discomfort, increased spasticity, and episodes of autonomic dysreflexia. Reduced sensation in the pelvic area means women with SCI usually have less painful delivery; in fact, they may fail to realize when <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> labor. If there are deformities in the pelvis or spine caesarian section may be necessary. Babies of women with SCI {{are more likely to be}} born prematurely, and, premature or not, they are more likely to be small for their gestational time.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of Sticky Fingers, the Rolling Stones left England after {{receiving}} financial advice from their financial manager at the time, Prince Rupert Loewenstein, recommending that <b>they</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> tax exile {{before the start of}} the next financial year. They had learned that despite promises made that taxes were taken care of, they had not been paid for seven years and that they owed the UK government a relative fortune that could have meant the end of the band. They moved to the South of France, where Richards rented the Villa Nellcôte and sublet rooms to band members and entourage. Using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, they held recording sessions in the basement; they completed the resulting tracks, along with material dating as far back as 1969, at Sunset Studios in Los Angeles. The resulting double album, Exile on Main St. (UK No. 1; US No. 1), was released in May 1972. Given an A+ grade by critic Robert Christgau and disparaged by Lester Bangs – who reversed his opinion within months – Exile is now accepted as one of the Stones' best albums. The films Cocksucker Blues (never officially released) and [...] (released in 1974) document the subsequent highly publicised 1972 North American Tour.|$|E
