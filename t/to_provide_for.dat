Thomas Henry's father, Peter Matthews, did not marry Marten but regularly sent money <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> the child.|$|E
5|$|In his Federalist No. 43, {{published}} January 23, 1788, James Madison {{argued that}} the new federal government would need authority over a national capital <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> its own maintenance and safety. Five years earlier, a band of unpaid soldiers besieged Congress while its members were meeting in Philadelphia.

5|$|Launched in 1987 {{priced at}} £350, Artemiz is the {{flagship}} tonearm whose design {{was also a}} break from established conventions.

40|$|The use of {{batteries}} <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> storage <b>for</b> photovoltaic {{power has}} been evaluated in various contexts. In grid-connected applications, batteries can serve <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> firm peak-shaving <b>for</b> distributed PV installations. To date, however, the use of batteries from parked electric-drive vehicles (EDV) <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> buffer storage <b>for</b> PV capacity value has not been analyzed. The emerging vehicle to grid (V 2 G) concept suggests that battery-powered EDVs can <b>provide</b> power <b>to</b> the grid to serve various markets. This paper evaluates the use of battery-powered EDVs <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> buffer storage <b>for</b> grid-connected PV installations, assuming a V 2 G infrastructure. The approach could serve <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> capacity value <b>for</b> PV installations, thus enhancing their value as distributed demand-side resources...|$|R

5|$|While Rastignac desires {{wealth and}} social status, Goriot longs {{only for the}} love of his daughters: a longing that borders on idolatry.

Even as he is dying in extreme poverty, {{at the end of the}} book, he sells his few remaining possessions <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> his daughters so that they might look splendid at a ball.|$|E

5|$|After independence, the Parliament of Singapore {{remained}} fully elected until 1984, when {{amendments to}} the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act were passed <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>for</b> Non-constituency Members of Parliament ("NCMPs"). NCMPs, who are declared elected by the returning officer, consist of the best performing losers in general elections based on the percentage of votes cast. The scheme ensures that opposition representation is accounted for in the Parliament. In 1990, yet another type of unelected Member was introduced – the Nominated Member of Parliament ("NMP"). These non-partisan Members were brought in to provide alternate views on policies that differed from the opinions espoused by the political parties represented in Parliament.|$|E
