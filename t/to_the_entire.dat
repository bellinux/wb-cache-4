5|$|A large {{broadcasting}} {{tower was}} {{needed in the}} Kantō region after NHK, Japan's public broadcasting station, began television broadcasting in 1953. Private broadcasting companies began operating {{in the months following}} the construction of NHK's own transmission tower. This communications boom led the Japanese government to believe that transmission towers would soon be built all over Tokyo, eventually overrunning the city. The proposed solution was the construction of one large tower capable of transmitting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> region. Furthermore, because of the country's postwar boom in the 1950s, Japan was searching for a monument to symbolize its ascendancy as a global economic powerhouse.|$|E

5|$|Although NY99 {{was signed}} as a state highway, {{maintenance}} on the route was performed by Franklin County, which designated the roadway as CR26. All of NY99 was initially a gravel road; however, most of the road was paved in the early 1970s {{through the use of}} state funds procured by New York State Senator Ronald Stafford of Plattsburgh. The western and eastern extents of the road were paved soon afterward; however, the road was left unpaved in the vicinity of Loon Lake—a lake near the midpoint of the route—even though the necessary gravel base was applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> highway. The unpaved section deteriorated as a result, and the NY99 designation was removed from the roadway on September26, 1994.|$|E

The British ships in fact had seen Moltke, but had decided to not open fire in order to not reveal their location <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> German fleet. At 23:55, and again at 00:20, Kapitän von Karpf tried to find a path through the British fleet, but both times was unable to do so. It was not until 01:00, after having steamed far ahead of the Grand Fleet, that Moltke was able to make good her escape.|$|E

Warren demanded an immediate halt <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> cleanup operation. He was especially concerned about plutonium, which was undetectable on site.|$|E
