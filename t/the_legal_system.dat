40|$|Efficient and {{sustainable}} use of forest resources depend on various factors. However, {{one of the}} most emphasized and discussed topics among these factors is forest ownership. Comparative law is an important way of analyzing and understanding <b>legal</b> <b>systems</b> of different countries, and identifying different aspects of <b>the</b> current <b>legal</b> <b>systems.</b> This study tries to analyze forest ownership with regard to comparative law. France for <b>the</b> Continental-European <b>legal</b> <b>system,</b> Great Britain for <b>the</b> Anglo-Saxon <b>legal</b> <b>system,</b> and Russia Federation for <b>the</b> Socialist <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> are taken respectively as a base. Thus, how right to ownership is evaluated in different <b>legal</b> <b>systems</b> and what are the main features of that are indicated. As a result, private forest ownership is common in <b>the</b> Continental-European <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> and Anglo-Saxon <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> while state ownership is common in <b>the</b> Socialist <b>legal</b> <b>system.</b> Prevalence of private forest ownership in the Continental-European and <b>the</b> Anglo-Saxon <b>legal</b> <b>systems</b> is also closely related to the previous use rights transferred into right to ownership. In addition, it is concluded regarding the historical process that many changes occurred on forest ownership types without considering differences in <b>legal</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

Across the country, the aristocracy and middle classes spoke French, often as a second language, and French was the language of <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> and government. There was a huge variation in accents, spelling and grammar across the country, particularly in Flanders, where regional dialects were almost incomprehensible to those from other regions.|$|E

5|$|The English law legal system, {{developed}} over the centuries, {{is the basis of}} common law legal systems used in most Commonwealth countries and the United States (except Louisiana). Despite now being part of the United Kingdom, <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> of the Courts of England and Wales continued, under the Treaty of Union, as a separate legal system from the one used in Scotland. The general essence of English law is that it is made by judges sitting in courts, applying their common sense and knowledge of legal precedent—stare decisis—to the facts before them.|$|E

5|$|Whatever Coke's meaning, {{after an}} initial period during which his {{decision}} enjoyed some support but no statutes were declared void, Bonham's Case was thrown aside, in favour of the growing doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty.

Parliamentary sovereignty is now the accepted judicial doctrine in <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> of England and Wales.|$|E

5|$|A {{young girl}} was found raped and murdered, and Max Stuart, an Aborigine, {{was convicted and}} sentenced to be {{executed}} only a month later, {{on the basis of a}} confession gained during interrogation, although he had protested his innocence in pidgin English. Stuart's lawyer claimed that the confession was forced, and appeals to the Supreme and High Courts were dismissed. A linguist who investigated the case thought that the style of English in the confession was inconsistent with Stuart's background and speech. This aroused disquiet and objections against the fairness of the trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, and The News brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign. Soon, the case attracted international attention, some on the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> was racist. The former High Court Justice Sir John Latham also spoke out.|$|E
5|$|Americans' mistrust and {{dislike of}} lawyers was a {{frequent}} topic of dissection in social problem films such Lawyer Man (1933), State's Attorney, and The Mouthpiece (1932). In films such as Paid (1930), <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> turns innocent characters into criminals. The life of Joan Crawford's character is ruined and her romantic interest is executed so that she may live free, although she is innocent of the crime for which the district attorney wants to convict her. Religious hypocrisy was addressed in such films as The Miracle Woman (1931), starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Frank Capra. Stanwyck also portrayed a nurse and initially reluctant heroine who manages to save, via unorthodox means, two young children in danger from nefarious characters (including Clark Gable as a malevolent chauffeur) in Night Nurse (1931).|$|E

5|$|As English courts do {{not form}} part of Singapore's {{hierarchy}} of courts, decisions of such courts are not binding on Singapore courts. However, {{as a result of}} Singapore's colonial heritage, English judicial precedents continue to exercise a strong influence on <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>system</b> and are regarded as highly persuasive, particularly as regards the development of the common law, and the interpretation of English statutes applicable in Singapore and Singapore statutes modelled on English enactments. Judicial precedents from other jurisdictions may also be persuasive in specific areas of Singapore law. For instance, Indian decisions are persuasive in the areas of criminal law and procedure because Singapore borrowed heavily from India in these areas.|$|E
5|$|Donna Lee Brien {{stated that}} just as the filmmakers {{attempted}} {{to distance themselves from}} Leigh's murder, the city of Newcastle attempted to distance itself from Blackrock. A 1999 feature in The Sydney Morning Herald discussing cinematic production in Newcastle mentioned everything from Mel Gibson's 1977 debut film Summer City to a short film festival that year, but made no mention of Blackrock. Brien theorised that some of the condemnation the film received may have been due to public frustration with <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>system,</b> as the film achieves justice for the victim, whereas no one was ever convicted of raping Leigh. Brien cited the film as an example of why sensitivity and care must be taken when fictionalising an actual crime.|$|E
5|$|Evidence for Edward's {{involvement}} in legal reform {{is hard to}} find but his reign saw a major programme of legal change. Much of the drive and determination is likely to have come from the king and his experience of the baronial reform movement of the late 1250s and early 1260s. With the Statutes of Mortmain, Edward imposed his authority over the Church; the statutes prohibited land donation to the Church, asserted the rights of the Crown at the expense of traditional feudal privileges, promoted the uniform administration of justice, raised income and codified <b>the</b> <b>legal</b> <b>system.</b> His military campaigns left him in heavy debt and when Philip IV of France confiscated the Duchy of Gascony in 1294, Edward needed funds to wage war in France. When Edward summoned a precedent-setting assembly in order to raise more taxes for military finance, he included lesser landowners and merchants. The resulting parliament included barons, clergy, knights, and burgesses for the first time.|$|E
