5|$|Charles Pearson (1793–1862) had {{proposed}} an underground railway connecting the City of London {{with the main}} line rail termini in around 1840. In 1854 he commissioned the first <b>traffic</b> <b>survey,</b> determining that each day 200,000 walked into the City, 44,000 travelled by omnibus, and 26,000 in private carriages. A Parliamentary Commission backed Pearson's proposal over other schemes. Despite concerns about vibration causing subsidence of buildings, the problems of compensating the many thousands whose homes were destroyed during digging of the tunnel, and fears that the tunnelling might break into Hell, construction began in 1860. On 9January 1863 the line opened as the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the world's first underground passenger railway.|$|E
5|$|In 1837 Euston {{railway station}} opened, the first railway station {{connecting}} London with the industrial heartlands of the West Midlands and Lancashire. Railways were banned by a Parliamentary commission from operating in London itself, {{and thus the}} station was built on {{what was then the}} northern boundary of the city. Other main line termini north of London soon followed at Paddington (1838), Bishopsgate (1840), Fenchurch Street (1841), King's Cross (1852) and St Pancras (1868). All were built outside the built-up area of the city, making them inconvenient to reach. Charles Pearson (1793–1862) had proposed the idea of an underground railway connecting the City of London with the relatively distant London main line rail termini in around 1840. In 1854 to promote the scheme he commissioned the first ever <b>traffic</b> <b>survey,</b> determining that each day 200,000 walked into the City of London, 44,000 travelled by omnibus, and 26,000 travelled in private carriages.

Past these businesses, the adjoining land is not developed {{for a short}} distance, and the roadway runs through some woodlands. North of the intersection with Golden Avenue, the highway passes through a residential neighborhood before terminating at M-96 (Columbia Avenue). The highway lies entirely within Emmett Township just southeast of Battle Creek. The trunkline carries an average annual daily traffic of 6,078vehicles south, and 5,728vehicles north, of Golden Avenue according to a <b>traffic</b> <b>survey</b> completed by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in 2010.

5|$|The traffic {{projections}} for the bridge {{at the planning stage}} {{have not been}} achieved. A <b>traffic</b> <b>survey</b> carried out for a week during June 2012 recorded traffic of 29,000 vehicles over the bridge in comparison to a projected 85,000. A survey conducted during the same period in June 2012 indicated a figure of 31,865 vehicles, though it is reported by the concerned traffic and transportation engineer that the rate of increase in traffic has been one percent per year on the basis of traffic surveys carried out from the time of commissioning of the bridge. The reason for the fall in traffic during 2012 is attributed to the peak monsoon effect during the survey period.|$|E
25|$|Interest in {{the project}} was rekindled in the late 1970, when the subsea Vardø Tunnel was planned and later built. The choice of a subsea tunnel {{alternative}} would allow for major costs savings, easily shaving away half the cost. Another contributing factor was the Oslo Airport location controversy, which proposed various locations for a new airport. A fixed crossing would be allow for a fixed service from Vestfold and Buskerud if an airport was located in Hobøl or Ås, and it would allow for a fixed service from Follo and Østfold if the airport was located in Hurum. Also {{the construction of a}} new plant at Tofte Cellulosefabrikk was expected to give a large rise in lumber transport to the region and could contribute to cross-fjord traffic. Previous analysis had been based on traffic data collected for other uses, so in 1980 a dedicated <b>traffic</b> <b>survey</b> was carried out.|$|E
500|$|Davison Avenue predates {{both the}} Davison Freeway and the M-8 state {{trunkline}} designation in the area. The roadway {{was named for}} Jarad Davison, an English immigrant {{and one of the}} early settlers of the area. The street {{was the only one of}} the 30 parallel streets in Highland Park that crossed through the city from border to border and connected with Detroit streets. This road was heavily congested, approaching gridlock during rush hour by 1940. A <b>traffic</b> <b>survey</b> showed that 96% of the traffic using the street was crossing Highland Park with no destination in the city. A proposal to rebuild the street as a six-lane, limited-access highway was approved by the Highland Park City Council on March 17, 1941. The council also appropriated $100,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) for the construction with Wayne County and the remaining $3,400,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) paid by state and federal government appropriations.|$|E

500|$|M-152 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with South County Line Road {{on the border}} between Van Buren and Berrien counties just west of Round Lake. [...] Known as 92nd Avenue, M-152 travels due east past the Sister Lakes area before turning south on 66th Street. From there, the road passes between Dewey and Magician Lakes before returning to its easterly course where it assumes the name Dewey Lake Street. Between the western terminus and Dewey Lake Street, the highway passes provides access to the cabins around the lakes. The route continues eastward for nearly three and a half miles through farmland before terminating at a junction with M-51. M-152 is not on the National Highway System, a system of regionally important highways. In a <b>traffic</b> <b>survey</b> by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in 2009, the department measured the average annual daily traffic (AADT), a computation of the average traffic levels for a segment of roadway on any given day of the year. This was calculated at 3,318vehicles over the entire length of M-152. The commercial AADT in the same survey was 73vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|ODOT {{measures}} the traffic volumes on its roadways via automated traffic recorders (ATRs), time-lapsed videos, and piezometric tube counters and then generate a <b>Traffic</b> <b>Survey</b> Report. The majority of sensors exist within the major cities, though more {{are planned for}} installation throughout the state. [...] The department also partners with the Ohio Department of Public Safety to monitor traffic related crashes. [...] Traffic crash reports are entered into a database that is shared by both departments. This Base Transportation Reporting System (BTRS) allows ODOT to review the number, frequency and severity of accidents that occur on its system. Traffic engineering is then used to establish safety threshold numbers and signal areas of concern for traffic safety.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1950s, {{the bridge}} had {{become part of}} a de facto outer ring road as it formed part of a main road, the A575, from Stretford to Bolton, {{avoiding}} both Manchester and Salford. A <b>traffic</b> <b>survey</b> in 1954 revealed 9,600 vehicles were using the bridge daily and it closed 7,000 times a year. A replacement bridge was considered vitally important to the local economy, particularly that of Trafford Park. William Proctor, MP for Eccles, said [...] "I cannot think of any other project in the North of England which should have higher priority than the Barton Bridge scheme." [...] Construction of the replacement Barton High Level Bridge started in 1957; the bridge opened to traffic in October 1960 and has been referred to informally as the [...] "Barton Bridge". Traffic on the swing bridge has also been reduced by the construction of Centenary Bridge located upstream towards Salford.|$|E

2500|$|Two controlled-access {{highways}} {{had been}} built prior to the Nazi era. The [...] long Avus (short for Automobil-Verkehrs- und Übungsstraße - automobile traffic and practice road) was built in Berlin starting in 1913. The corporation to build it was organized in 1909, and construction continued during World War I using prisoners of war, {{but it was not}} completed and officially opened until 1921. This was originally intended as a race track, and was used for testing vehicles and road surfaces, but it had many of the characteristics of the later Reichsautobahn and served as a model for Piero Puricelli's 1924 autostrada between Milan and the Northern Italian lakes, the first true motorway in the world. In 192932, a highway some [...] long that also resembled the Reichsautobahn except for the lack of a median strip was built between Cologne and Bonn using unemployed labor; on the basis of this, the then Lord Mayor of Cologne and Chairman of the Provincial committee for autostraßen, Konrad Adenauer, could be credited as having built an autobahn before Hitler. The [...] "Opladen bypass" [...] between Cologne and Düsseldorf was also built in 193133.
