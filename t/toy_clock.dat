50|$|While {{the system}} is shut down, time is kept by a Time-of-Year ("TOY") {{hardware}} clock. This clock keeps time to a lower resolution (perhaps 1 second) and generally, a lower accuracy (often 0.025% versus 0.01%). When {{the system is}} restarted, the VMS 64-bit time value is recomputed based on the time kept by the <b>TOY</b> <b>clock</b> and the last recorded year (stored on the system disk).|$|E
40|$|Young {{children}} are devoting increasing time to playing on handheld touchscreen devices (e. g., iPads). Though thousands of touchscreen apps are {{claimed to be}} educational, {{there is a lack}} of sufficient evidence examining the impact of touchscreens on children’s learning outcomes. In the present study, the two questions we focused on were (a) whether using a touchscreen was helpful in teaching children to tell time, and (b) to what extent young children could transfer what they had learned on the touchscreen to other media. A pre- and posttest design was adopted. After learning to read the time on the iPad touchscreen for 10 minutes, three groups of 5 - to 6 -year-old children (N = 65) were respectively tested with an iPad touchscreen, a <b>toy</b> <b>clock</b> or a drawing of a clock on paper. The results revealed that posttest scores in the iPad touchscreen test group were significantly higher than those at pretest, indicating that the touchscreen itself could provide support for young children’s learning. Similarly, regardless of being tested with a <b>toy</b> <b>clock</b> or paper drawing, children’s posttest performance was also better than pretest, suggesting that children could transfer what they had learned on an iPad touchscreen to other media. However, comparison among groups showed that children tested with the paper drawing underperformed those tested with the other two media. The theoretical and practical implications of the results, as well as limitations of the present study, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Detailed documentations of {{creative}} invention are scarce {{in the professional}} literature, but could be useful to those engaging in or studying the problem solving process. This investigation describes the creative process of graduate students (7 female, 4 male) in a problem-solving theory and practice course grappling {{with the task of}} creating products from four identical recyclable items that were circular, star-impressed bottoms of plastic juice bottles. Several popular models of the problem-solving process are compared to the participants’ steps in this invention problem. Participants first provided emotional reactions to the given ill-defined problem of making a product from the specified items. They used several techniques to generate ideas and to restrict or define the problem, choosing an optimal product that fits their require-ments. An analysis of participants’ reflections concerning their creative process showed that although participants first found the problem challenging and could not conceptualize effective products, the idea-generating activities assisted them in making a wide variety of useful products. Participants’ knowledge and skill areas were highlighted by their choices of products. After completing and presenting a first product, participants engaged in additional activities to generate ideas for a second product. The second product was either an improvement of the first product, a new but related product, or a product inspired by the work of others in the class. Products of this loosely defined problem included: maracas, dish, spin top, candy suckers, closet organizers, party decorations, yoyo, ladybug, wall décor, flowers, catch game, party hat, candle holders, moth life cycle, catapult game, <b>toy</b> <b>clock,</b> goblets, castanets, accessory organizer, and spice shaker. </p...|$|E

25|$|Limited-range drivers, {{also used}} alone, are {{typically}} found in computers, <b>toys,</b> and <b>clock</b> radios. These drivers are less elaborate {{and less expensive}} than wide-range drivers, {{and they may be}} severely compromised to fit into very small mounting locations. In these applications, sound quality is a low priority. The human ear is remarkably tolerant of poor sound quality, and the distortion inherent in limited-range drivers may enhance their output at high frequencies, increasing clarity when listening to spoken word material.|$|R

50|$|A popular <b>clock</b> <b>toy,</b> marketed by Fisher-Price from 1962 to 1968, had a dial on it that, when turned, {{caused the}} music box {{mechanism}} in the toy to play the song along with clock-like ticking and moving hands {{on the face of}} the clock. An updated version of the toy (which is completely made of plastic and with other activities like a clicking plastic mouse on the side) has been manufactured by Fisher-Price since 1994. Imitations of the toy made by various companies exist and are sold in various countries worldwide.|$|R
50|$|Tik-Tok (sometimes spelled Tiktok) is a round-bodied {{mechanical}} {{man made}} of copper, {{that runs on}} clockwork springs which periodically need to be wound, like a wind-up <b>toy</b> or mechanical <b>clock.</b> He has separate windings for thought, action, and speech. Tik-Tok is unable to wind any of them up himself. When his works run down, he becomes frozen or mute or, for one memorable moment in The Road to Oz, continues to speak but utters gibberish. When he speaks, only his teeth move. His knees and elbows are described as resembling those in a knight's suit of armor. Being a machine, he is endowed with superhuman strength, allowing him to single-handedly overpower a whole horde of Wheelers without much difficulty, as demonstrated in a scene of the 1985 movie, Return to Oz.|$|R
50|$|The {{economic}} development of the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone took off after the reform programme was instituted. The region's GDP grew from just over US$8 billion in 1980 to more than US$89 billion in 2000 and nearly US$221.2 billion in 2005. During that period, the average real rate of GDP growth in the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone exceeded 16 percent, well above the People's Republic of China national figure of 9.8 percent. Since the onset of China's reform programme, the Pearl River Delta Economic Zone has been the fastest growing portion {{of the fastest growing}} province in the fastest growing large economy in the world. In the process, a region that was once largely agricultural has emerged as a manufacturing platform of global importance. It is a world leader in the production of electronic goods, electrical products, electrical and electronic components, watches and <b>clocks,</b> <b>toys,</b> garments and textiles, plastic products, and a range of other goods.|$|R
5000|$|Each episode {{would also}} include a short story read from a book, {{introduced}} by checking the time on a clock. Normally the clock would show either an hour or a half hour and the young viewers were asked, [...] "Can you tell what time the clock says today? Well, the long hand is pointing straight up, so that means it's something o'clock - and the short hand is pointing to the number...two (or whatever). So today, the clock says, two...o'...clock" [...] (the latter phrase always delivered very slowly). This was followed by, [...] "But what's underneath the clock?", and viewers would then see a turntable under the clock featuring certain items such as <b>toy</b> animals or <b>clocks,</b> which were, in a clever twist, always {{a clue to the}} forthcoming story. This was all accompanied by a slightly eerie, yet undeniably catchy, clock-like tune. (On one occasion, the item under the clock turned out to be none other than Little Ted, so the presenter concerned said, [...] "What a very odd place for a toy to be!" [...] and the story appropriately turned out to be about odd things).|$|R
