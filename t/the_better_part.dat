5000|$|The album art, {{conceived}} by Nascimento, was drawn by a California-based comics artist Ramiro Montanez. [...] Nascimento describes the album cover: [...] "It’s metaphorical {{in the sense}} that it depicts both aspects of my life; light and darkness.

50|$|Modern life in China's {{urban village}} is vastly {{different}} from the traditional agricultural way of life {{due to the lack}} of farmland. A new lifestyle has developed in which landowners build multi-story houses (which is allocated by the village collective) and rent them to the city’s floating population, who are not able to afford an apartment in <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>parts</b> of <b>the</b> city.|$|R

5|$|The Weather Bureau {{had issued}} {{the first of}} its twice-daily reports at {{approximately}} 8:00a.m.; it did not send another report to Washington, D.C. until 8:00p.m. This proved to be a serious problem: the storm would have <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of a day to build up hurricane forces before the Bureau headquarters in Washington, D.C., would have detailed information.|$|E
5|$|Torres {{was drafted}} {{out of the}} Ontario Hockey League (OHL), where he played three seasons with the Brampton Battalion. He was a two-time OHL Second Team All-Star during his junior career. Beginning in 2001–02, he turned {{professional}} with the Islanders' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate. He spent <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of two seasons in the AHL before the Islanders traded him to the Oilers in 2003. He played five seasons in Edmonton, becoming a full-time NHL player with the club. He recorded career numbers as an Oiler in 2005–06, while also helping them to the Stanley Cup Finals that year. In the 2008 off-season, he was dealt to the Blue Jackets, where he played <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of two seasons. After a brief stint with the Sabres in 2009–10, he signed with the Canucks and played one year for them where they reached the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals.

5|$|Once {{freed from}} running <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of two businesses, and financially independent, Muller went to Germany to study {{geography}} and ethnography. He attended lectures at the universities of Heidelberg and Leipzig before completing his doctorate at the University of Giessen in 1894, summa cum laude. His thesis Land und Leute zwischen Zambezi und Limpopo (Land and People between Zambezi and Limpopo) was mainly based on secondary material, {{rather than the}} materials collected and observations made by Muller himself during his time in East Africa. This limited the originality of the study, although in its time it was appreciated as an important piece of academic work, and was also published in a commercial version.|$|E

50|$|Four More Respected Gentlemen (Reprise RS 6309) is an {{unreleased}} album by the British {{rock group}} The Kinks. Most {{of the songs}} were recorded in 1968, the year the album was assembled solely for the US market. This album would have been released in parallel with a Europe-only 12-song early version of The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society. Instead, manufacture of the 12-song album was stopped (where possible) and a 15-song version of The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society—combining <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>parts</b> of both albums and adding newly recorded songs—was released instead, in both the UK and USA.|$|R

5|$|The Melbourne Storm has {{a strong}} rivalry with Brisbane, built {{in large part on}} the large number of finals games played between the teams, {{including}} one final in each year from 2004 to 2009; the Storm winning all but one of them. The move of Brisbane assistant coach Craig Bellamy to Melbourne has also been attributed to fueling the rivalry, as well as the wide spread of Queensland Origin players across their squads in <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of the past decade.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Empire conquered Dacia in AD 101 and 106, {{during the}} rule of Trajan, and the Roman {{settlement}} Napoca, established thereafter, is first recorded on a milestone discovered in 1758 {{in the vicinity of}} the city. Trajan's successor Hadrian granted Napoca the status of municipium as municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napocenses. Later, in the 2nd century AD, the city gained the status of a colonia as Colonia Aurelia Napoca. Napoca became a provincial capital of Dacia Porolissensis and thus the seat of a procurator. The colonia was evacuated in 274 by the Romans. There are no references to urban settlement on the site for <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of a millennium thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} factor that negatively affects maintenance is the low and irregular pay that soldiers receive, resulting in the theft and sale of spare parts and even basic equipment to supplement their meager salaries. When not stealing spare parts and equipment, maintenance personnel often spend <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of their duty day looking for other ways to profit. American maintenance teams working in Zaire found that providing a free lunch to the work force was a good, sometimes the only, technique to motivate personnel to work {{at least half of}} the duty day.|$|E
5000|$|Hammerstein's Roof Garden (1899 - 1915) was the {{official}} name the semi-outdoor vaudeville venue that theatre magnate, Oscar Hammerstein I, built atop the Victoria Theatre and the neighboring Theatre Republic, commonly known {{then as the}} Belasco Theatre. Unlike Hammerstein’s first roof garden theatre, which crowned his failed Olympia Theatre, the Paradise Roof Garden was able to rise to prominence and contend with its rivals for <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>parts</b> of two decades. [...] For New York City theatre-goers, the name Hammerstein’s grew to encompass both the Victoria and its roof garden.From 1904 to 1914 it was run by Willie Hammerstein, who put on highly popular vaudeville acts.|$|R

The soundtrack was also praised as one of <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>parts</b> of <b>the</b> game by critics. New soundtracks usually come out to coincide with a new DLC or heist. There are currently around 56 tracks in the game, five of which are remixes of songs from the first game, Payday: The Heist.A second soundtrack entitled A Merry Payday Christmas features music played during the [...] "GO Bank" [...] heist from a boombox in said bank. It consists of humorous Christmas music sung by Hoxton (Pete Gold) from Payday: The Heist while in prison.|$|R
5|$|Through the {{influence}} of a rise in follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few ovarian follicles are stimulated. These follicles, which were present at birth and have been developing for <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of a year in a process known as folliculogenesis, compete with each other for dominance. Under {{the influence}} of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity. The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary, or Graafian, follicle, and it contains the ovum.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} company's major offerings, {{the chicken}} fries are {{sometimes}} the center of product advertising for the company. The original advertisements were created by the firm of Crispin, Porter + Bogusky and were the subject of both criticism and legal action by the nu metal band Slipknot over claims of intellectual property rights, while later advertising programs started the company on a new direction of digital-based, multi-media advertising. With the product's North American reintroduction in 2014 and 2015, Burger King utilized a heavy social media campaign to help entice fans of the product back into restaurants. The company has also relied heavily on product tie-ins with the NFL, NCAA and NASCAR to promote the product across different demographic groups. Even though the product has been a prominent part of the menu for <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of a decade, Burger King has released very few limited-time (LTO) variants of the product – its first one being released {{in the summer of}} 2015. Despite being a major product line in the company's portfolio, Burger King has registered very few, if any, global trademarks to protect its investment in the product.|$|E
5|$|The rise {{to power}} of the Nazi Party on 30 January 1933 gave German motor companies, notably Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union, an {{opportunity}} to return to motor racing. Having secured promises of funding shortly after the Nazis' {{rise to power}}, both companies spent <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of 1933 developing their racing projects. Alfred Neubauer, the Mercedes racing manager, travelled to the Caracciolas' chalet in Lugano in November {{with a plan to}} sign him for the 1934 Grand Prix season if he was fit. Neubauer challenged Caracciola to walk, and although the driver laughed and smiled while he did so Neubauer was not fooled: Caracciola was not yet fit. Nevertheless, he offered him a contract, provided he prove his fitness in testing at the AVUS track early in the next year. Caracciola agreed and went to Stuttgart to sign the contract. The trip wore him out so much he spent much of his time lying on his hotel bed recuperating.|$|E
40|$|PEP-II {{transverse}} profiles {{are measured}} by imaging visible synchrotron light from dipoles {{in the two}} rings. The images are broadened by surface errors on the primary extraction mirrors, which have a complex design due to high beam currents. To improve vertical beam-size measurements, we installed a synchrotron-light interfero-meter, following Mitsuhashi at KEK. In a two-slit inter-ferometer, fine fringes modulate the single-slit pattern from a point source. As the source size increases, the fringe depth decreases, providing a sensitive tool. Because the slits pass light from two stripes along the mirror, we can select <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>parts</b> of its surface.

The blonde Borden won scholarships as the 1957 Miss Arizona and then as a contestant in the 1958 Miss America pageant. She lost to Marilyn Van Derbur of Colorado but was nevertheless a preliminary swimsuit winner and a Top 10 semi-finalist. She enrolled at the University of Arizona-Tucson, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in theater.

5|$|With the {{resumption}} of hostilities, Napoleon (proclaimed Emperor in 1804) planned an invasion of England, spending <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>part</b> {{of the next two}} years (1803–05) on this objective. In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish agreement {{led to the creation of}} the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France and neutralising the threat of invasion. Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes, and by April 1805, the two had signed a treaty of alliance. Alarmed by Napoleon's consolidation of northern Italy into a kingdom under his rule, and keen on revenge for having been defeated twice in recent memory by France, Austria would join the coalition a few months later.|$|E
5|$|Between 1946 and 1950, Snetkov was {{assistant}} {{chief of staff}} for operations of a regiment, and then entered the Military Academy of the Armored Forces, graduating in 1953. Until 1965, he successively served as a regimental chief of staff, chief of a division's operations staff department, and commander of a tank regiment. Between 1965 and 1966 Snetkov was chief of staff of a division, and in 1968 he graduated from the Military Academy of the General Staff. After graduating, Snetkov took command of a tank division in the Kiev Military District, and in May 1971 transferred to the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany (GSFG) as chief of staff and first deputy commander of the 3rd Shock Army. He was promoted to major general in 1972, and would serve in the GSFG for <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>part</b> of the decade. He was appointed commander of the 1st Guards Tank Army in August 1973, after which he was promoted to lieutenant general in 1974, and became First Deputy Commander in July 1975. He left East Germany to command the Siberian Military District in January 1979, and was promoted to colonel general that year, moving westwards again to lead the Leningrad Military District in November 1981.

5|$|The {{lectures and}} book had been {{originally}} scheduled for 2009, but were {{moved up to}} 2008 to avoid conflicting with Atwood's forthcoming novel after the latter book was delayed by its publisher. The content examines borrowing and lending from financial, psychological, theological, literary, and ecological points of view. Its release coincided with extensive {{media coverage of the}} recent financial crisis which led numerous critics to comment on the book's timeliness. In the Canadian market, the book peaked at #1 on The Globe and Mail bestseller list on October 25 and out-sold all previous Massey Lecture books. Critics found the book well-researched, thought-provoking, and humorous. Various reviewers found the discussions on the non-monetary aspects of debt to be <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>parts</b> of <b>the</b> book, while some critics identified the sections on ecological debt as the worse parts of the book.|$|R

60|$|Alas for them! {{there are}} many excuses. Sorrow may be a {{softening}} medicine at last, but at first it is apt to be a hardening one; and that savage outlaw life which they were leading can never have been a wholesome one for any soul of man, and its graces must have existed only in the brains of harpers and gleemen. Away from law, from self-restraint, from refinement, from elegance, from the very sound of a church-going bell, they were sinking gradually down {{to the level of}} the coarse men and women whom they saw; the worse and not <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>parts</b> of both their characters were getting the upper hand; and it was but too possible that after a while the hero might sink into the ruffian, the lady into a slattern and a shrew.|$|R
40|$|The {{historical}} {{report on the}} cholera epidemic of 1855, conserved in Ferrara City's archives allowed us to verify the probable relation between the environment and epidemic in a broad sense, using log-linear analysis and multiple logistic regression. Two thousand and thirty-three cases were analyzed and the quantitative/qualitative variables available from the report were analyzed in relationship with mortality and morbidity rates, considered as response variables. From {{the analysis of the}} quantitative variables, it emerges that the variables having a significant influence on the morbidity/mortality rates are the number of individuals and the average number of inhabitants per house. From the analysis of the qualitative variables, it emerges that all the descriptive variables {{of the state of the}} streets and houses express a strong association with mortality and morbidity. With the present analysis, data available [...] a detailed 'street by street' morbidity and mortality recording from cholera in 1855 in Ferrara [...] were analyzed with modern means and the overall picture that emerge is that in <b>the</b> <b>better</b> kept houses in <b>the</b> <b>better</b> <b>parts</b> of <b>the</b> town had less cholera morbidity and especially mortality...|$|R
