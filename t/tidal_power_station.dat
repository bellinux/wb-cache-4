5|$|Unlike {{wind and}} wave, tidal power is an {{inherently}} predictable source. However {{the technology is}} in its infancy and numerous devices are in the prototype stages. Today {{it is known that}} a tall tubular tower with three blades attached to it is the typical profile of a wind turbine, but twenty-five years ago there were a wide variety of different systems being tested. This is the current situation with regard to tidal power. Some systems capture energy from the tides in a vertical direction. The tide comes in and raises the water level in a basin. As the tide lowers the water in the basin is discharged through a turbine. Tidal stream power captures energy from the flow of tides, usually using underwater plant resembling a small wind turbine. An example is Marine Current Turbines SeaGen 1.2MW device at Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland, which is the largest tidal stream turbine in the world. To date the only two installed tidal power plants of notable size are the Sihwa Lake <b>Tidal</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea and the Rance <b>Tidal</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> in Brittany, France, rated at 254 MW and 240 MW respectively. There are also many small scale projects throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|The world's first {{large-scale}} {{tidal power}} plant was the Rance <b>Tidal</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> in France, which became operational in 1966. It was the largest <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> in terms of output until Sihwa Lake <b>Tidal</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> opened in South Korea in August 2011. The Sihwa station uses sea wall defense barriers complete with 10 turbines generating 254 MW.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tidal</b> <b>power</b> is {{the most}} {{predictable}} of all the variable renewable energy sources. Twice a day the tides vary 100%, but they are never intermittent, on the contrary they are completely reliable. It is estimated that Britain could obtain 20% of energy from <b>tidal</b> <b>power,</b> only 20 sites {{in the world have}} yet been identified as possible <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{studies have}} {{proposed}} {{the possibility of}} erecting <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> generating <b>stations</b> within the strait, to be powered from the predictable current at the strait.|$|R
40|$|With {{continuous}} development of marine engineering, {{more and more}} new structures {{are used in the}} exploring of tidal current energy. Three are there different kinds of support structures for <b>tidal</b> current <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> which are sea-bed mounted/gravity based system, pile mounted system and floating moored platform. Comparison with them, the floating mooring system is suit for deep water and the application of which will be widely. In this study, catamaran and semi-submersible as floating platform of <b>tidal</b> current <b>power</b> <b>station</b> are studied. And they are compared with its economic, efficiency of turbine and stability of station. It is found that the catamaran is optimal choice. Based on basic ship theory and using software MOSES, the stability of Catamaran <b>tidal</b> current <b>power</b> <b>station</b> is also calculated. The research of this study is significant and it will be as the reference for the future study...|$|R
25|$|The first <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> was the Rance {{tidal power}} plant built {{over a period of}} 6years from 1960 to 1966 at La Rance, France. It has 240MW {{installed}} capacity.|$|E
25|$|The Indian {{state of}} Gujarat is {{planning}} to host South Asia's first commercial-scale <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>station.</b> The company Atlantis Resources planned to install a 50MW tidal farm in the Gulf of Kutch on India's west coast, with construction starting early in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The Jiangxia <b>Tidal</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Station,</b> {{south of}} Hangzhou [...] in China has been {{operational}} since 1985, with current installed capacity of 3.2 MW. More tidal power is planned {{near the mouth}} of the Yalu River.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{production}} from <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> {{is still in}} a pre-commercial stage. The European Marine Energy Centre has installed a wave testing system at Billia Croo on the Orkney mainland and a <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> testing <b>station</b> on the nearby island of Eday. Since 2003, a prototype Wave Dragon energy converter has been in operation at Nissum Bredning fjord of northern Denmark.|$|R
50|$|The {{coastline}} of Pakistan, {{which is}} about 1,045 km-long with dominant features, is the best resource for harnessing tidal energy. In Sindh, two sites, creek system of Indus delta of 170 km and two to five metres tidal heights at the Korangi Creek, are available to exploit the tidal energy. Sonmiani Beach and Kalamat are also good prospects of tidal energy in Balochistan. Government has issued licence to private companies to take measures to build <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> in February 2013. Since then, the engineering work is under process, and initially a 10 MW plant is proposed at Sonmiani Bay. Construction was expected to start {{by the end of}} 2013.|$|R
5000|$|The barrage {{will not}} create a [...] "lagoon"—as both opponents and {{supporters}} have sometimes claimed. <b>Tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations</b> by definition require that the tide flows through the barrage, but the tidal range in the Severn would be halved. There are claims that the migration of fish would be hampered, but these are contested. The Severn bore would also be eliminated. Any barrage {{would be likely to}} stimulate coastal erosion in some areas, and create a negative visual impact upon the landscape (subjective, similar to wind turbines). There would also be negative consequences of the huge amount of concrete (and other materials) needed, with the quarrying of stone likely to impact on other areas.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> {{makes use}} of the daily {{rise and fall of}} ocean water due to tides; such sources are highly predictable, and if {{conditions}} permit construction of reservoirs, can also be dispatchable to generate power during high demand periods. Less common types of hydro schemes use water's kinetic energy or undammed sources such as undershot water wheels. Tidal power is viable in {{a relatively small number of}} locations around the world. In Great Britain, there are eight sites that could be developed, which ...|$|E
2500|$|The lagoons {{can also}} be in double (or triple) format without pumping [...] or with pumping that will flatten out the power output. The pumping power could be {{provided}} by excess to grid demand renewable energy from for example wind turbines or solar photovoltaic arrays. Excess renewable energy rather than being curtailed could be used and stored for a later period of time. Geographically dispersed tidal lagoons with a time delay between peak production would also flatten out peak production providing near base load production though at a higher cost than some other alternatives such as district heating renewable energy storage. The proposed Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay in Wales, United Kingdom would be the first <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> of this type once built.|$|E
50|$|Opened in 1966 as the world's first <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>station,</b> it is {{currently}} operated by Électricité de France and was for 45 years the largest <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>station</b> {{in the world by}} installed capacity until the South Korean Sihwa Lake <b>Tidal</b> <b>Power</b> <b>Station</b> surpassed it in 2011.|$|E
50|$|SeaGen was {{the first}} {{full-scale}} <b>tidal</b> flow <b>power</b> <b>station</b> {{to be connected to}} the grid to produce electricity for consumption. It was due to be installed in 2007 but delays with the installation barge meant that it was not installed until March 2008 after being modified extensively to permit the use of a crane barge rather than a jackup as originally planned.|$|R
50|$|The tides in Penzhin Bay are 9 m high, {{and reach}} 12.9 m {{in the case}} of spring tides, which is the highest {{magnitude}} for the Pacific Ocean. As the area of the bay basin is 20,530 km2 (7,930 mi2), it corresponds to diurnal discharge of 360-530 km3 (86-130 cu mi). This water rate is 20-30 times higher than that of the world's biggest river, the Amazon River. Two projects were developed for <b>tidal</b> <b>power</b> <b>stations.</b> The first would use the entire basin of the bay. The second proposes a smaller-scale plant, using {{the northern part of the}} basin with higher tides:Due to the lack of existing local energy consumers or long-distance power distribution infrastructure, there are suggestions of a discrete work of the station to supply power-consuming production. One such consumer, for example, would be the production of liquid hydrogen.|$|R

40|$|Tidal {{energy has}} been used for centuries. Tidal current and rise and fall of tides were both put to work.
