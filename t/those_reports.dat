5|$|After the team’s 44 finish, Michigan {{dismissed}} Harry Kipke as head coach. Anderson, {{described by}} Heikkinen as the “greatest line technician in football today,” also resigned as line coach. Asked about rumors that players {{did not like}} Kipke, Heikkinen said <b>those</b> <b>reports</b> were probably originated by disgruntled players who {{did not make the}} squad or were in other ways dissatisfied. However, just over a year later, in February 1939, Heikkinen led the opposition when Kipke ran for the University’s Board of Regents and campaigned actively for Kipke’s opponent.|$|E

Sources close to the film's unit initially denied <b>those</b> <b>reports.</b> Samantha later tweeted that Akhil appeared for shooting his portions in the film. When his health conditions worsened, Nageswara Rao asked Nagarjuna to bring the dubbing equipment to dub for his role fifteen days before his surgery as he did not want any other artist to do it if his voice worsened. He completed those activities just before he died on 22 January 2014. Only an appearance in a song remained incomplete.|$|E

Billboard felt that Sony acquiring the estate's stake was the most likely outcome, noting the potential revenue the library could bring in regards to licensing for on-demand music streaming services.|$|E

5|$|In 1937 Briskin was {{responsible}} for bringing Milton Berle to the screen. During a strike by the Federated Motion Picture Crafts union in 1937, there was concern {{that they would be}} joined by members of the Screen Actors Guild. Briskin was one of four producers chosen by the producers guild to negotiate with the actors' union to head off them joining the walkout. As the new film season started in the summer of 1937, Briskin announced that RKO would have a significant increase in their overall production budget from $14.5 million in the 1936–37 season, to $18 million for the 1937–38 season. In mid-July 1937, it was announced that Briskin had received a long-term extension on his contract, however, several months later it was revealed that the deal had never been finalized, and that Briskin was considering leaving RKO. In early November the change became official when Briskin resigned as RKO's head of production. Briskin had been offered a three-year deal by the studio, which he rejected. Rumors began to circulate about where Briskin was headed. In early December it was being reported that Briskin would be heading to Paramount, although he denied <b>those</b> <b>reports.</b>|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{association}} between perceived environmental barriers to and facilitators for outdoor mobility with life-space among older people. Methods: Community-dwelling, 75 - to 90 -year-old people (n = 848) were interviewed face-to-face using standard questionnaires. The Life-Space Assessment (LSA), indicating distance and frequency of moving and assistance needed in moving (range 0 - 120), was used. Environmental barriers and facilitators outdoors were self-reported. Results: Altogether, 41 % (n = 348) of the participants had restricted life-space (LSA score < 60). <b>Those</b> <b>reporting</b> one or more environmental barriers had {{more than double the}} odds for restricted life-space compared with <b>those</b> <b>reporting</b> no barriers after adjustments for ill health, functioning, and socioeconomic status (SES) differences. Similarly, <b>those</b> <b>reporting</b> four to seven facilitators had lower odds for restricted life-space compared with <b>those</b> <b>reporting</b> three or fewer facilitators.

25|$|Before the Wall Street Crash of 1929, {{there was}} no {{regulation}} of securities at the federal level. Even firms whose securities were publicly traded published no regular reports or even worse rather misleading reports based on arbitrarily selected data.

It required the disclosure of the balance sheet, profit and loss statement, the names and compensations of corporate officers, about firms whose securities were traded.

After checking with Chikatilo's present and previous employers, investigators were able to place him in various towns and cities at times when several victims linked to the investigation had been killed. Questioning of former colleagues from Chikatilo's teaching days revealed that Chikatilo had been forced to resign from two teaching positions due to repeated complaints of lewd behaviour and sexual assault made by his pupils.|$|E
25|$|Only {{about one}} in one million of the {{intermediaries}} decay along the third pathway, making its products comparatively rare {{when compared to the}} other paths. This result is consistent with the predictions of the Bohr model. If one watt (1 eV = 1.602 x 10−19 joule) of nuclear power were produced from deuteron fusion consistent with known branching ratios, the resulting neutron and tritium (3H) production would be easily measured. Some researchers reported detecting 4He but without the expected neutron or tritium production; such a result would require branching ratios strongly favouring the third pathway, with the actual rates of the first two pathways lower by at least five orders of magnitude than observations from other experiments, directly contradicting both theoretically predicted and observed branching probabilities. <b>Those</b> <b>reports</b> of 4He production did not include detection of gamma rays, which would require the third pathway to have been changed somehow so that gamma rays are no longer emitted.|$|E

The Greek Government has created a corporation, Olympic Properties SA, which is overseeing the post-Olympics management, development and conversion of these facilities, some of which will be sold off (or have already been sold off) to the private sector, while other facilities are still in use just as during the Olympics, or have been converted for commercial use or modified for other sports.
