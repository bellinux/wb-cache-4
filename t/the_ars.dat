However, {{sports fans}} {{continually}} {{argued for a}} three-mile (5km) extension to the Capital Centre sports arena in Largo, Maryland. On February 27, 1997, the WMATA board approved construction of the extension. By the time the extension opened in 2004, professional basketball and hockey had relocated to a new arena atop the Gallery Place Station and the Capital Centre was replaced with a shopping mall. However, the extension still drew considerable sport spectator traffic because it is {{within walking distance of}} the FedExField football stadium. The extension cost $456 million.|$|E
5|$|While a {{cut-and-fill}} tunnel for Yellow Line {{was built}} under 7th Street and U Street, both street traffic and pedestrian access on those streets were difficult. The {{result was the}} loss of the traditional retail businesses along the route. The downtown segment of the line was originally projected to open in September 1977. Obtaining approval of the District of Columbia and Prince Georges' County of the exact alignment of the Yellow Line north of U Street delayed construction. Originally, <b>the</b> <b>ARS</b> called for the line to be placed in the median strip of the planned North Central Freeway, but after that road was cancelled, the route of the replacement subway tunnel became controversial, resulting in years of expensive delays.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background A crucial {{event in}} Prostate Cancer {{progression}} is the conversion from a hormone-sensitive to a hormone-refractory disease state. Correlating with this transition, androgen receptor (AR) amplification and mutations are often observed in patients failing hormonal ablation therapies. β-Catenin, {{an essential component}} of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, was shown to be a coactivator of <b>the</b> <b>AR</b> signaling in <b>the</b> presence of androgens. However, it is not yet clear what effect the increased levels of <b>the</b> <b>AR</b> could have on the Wnt signaling pathway in these hormone-refractory prostate cells. Results Transient transfections of several human prostate cancer cell lines with <b>the</b> <b>AR</b> and multiple components of the Wnt signaling pathway demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>AR</b> overexpression can potentiate the transcriptional activities of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling. In addition, the simultaneous activation of the Wnt signaling pathway and overexpression of <b>the</b> <b>AR</b> promote prostate cancer cell growth and transformation at castration levels of androgens. Interestingly, the presence of physiological levels of androgen or other AR agonists inhibits these effects. These observations are consistent with the nuclear co-localization of <b>the</b> <b>AR</b> and β-Catenin shown by immunohistochemistry in human prostate cancer samples. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that Wnt 3 A can recruit <b>the</b> <b>AR</b> to <b>the</b> promoter regions of Myc and Cyclin D 1, which are well-characterized downstream targets of the Wnt signalling pathway. The same assays demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>AR</b> and β-Catenin can be recruited to the promoter and enhancer regions of a known AR target gene PSA upon Wnt signaling. These results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>AR</b> is promoting Wnt signaling at the chromatin level. Conclusion Our findings suggest that <b>the</b> <b>AR</b> signaling through <b>the</b> Wnt/β-Catenin pathway should be added to the well established functional interactions between both pathways. Moreover, our data show that via this interaction <b>the</b> <b>AR</b> could promote prostate cell malignancy in a ligand-independent manner. </p...|$|R

30|$|Augmented reality (AR) {{has been}} widely applied in our lives. An AR tag is usually used and stacked on {{products}} for sake of being detected and recognized easily.

40|$|<b>The</b> {{androgen}} receptor (<b>AR)</b> is a nuclear hormone receptor superfamily member that conveys both trans repression and ligand-dependent trans-activation function. Activation of <b>the</b> <b>AR</b> by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) regulates diverse physiological functions including secondary sexual differentiation {{in the male}} and the induction of apoptosis by the JNK kinase, MEKK 1. <b>The</b> <b>AR</b> is posttranslationally modified on lysine residues by acetylation and sumoylation. The histone acetylases p 300 and P/CAF directly acetylate <b>the</b> <b>AR</b> in vitro at a conserved KLKK motif. To determine the functional properties governed by AR acetylation, point mutations of the KLKK motif that abrogated acetylation were engineered and examined in vitro and in vivo. <b>The</b> <b>AR</b> acetylation site point mutants showed wild-type trans repression of NF-κB, AP- 1, and Sp 1 activity; wild-type sumoylation in vitro; wild-type ligand binding; and ligand-induced conformational changes. However, acetylation-deficient AR mutants were selectively defective in DHT-induced trans activation of androgen-responsive reporter genes and coactivation by SRC 1, Ubc 9, TIP 60, and p 300. <b>The</b> <b>AR</b> acetylation site mutant showed 10 -fold increased binding of the N-CoR corepressor compared with <b>the</b> <b>AR</b> wild type {{in the presence of}} ligand.
