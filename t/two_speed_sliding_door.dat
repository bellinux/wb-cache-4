50|$|The {{introduction}} of High <b>Speed</b> Trains and <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> carriages in the 1970s and 1980s, {{did much to}} improve access for disabled passengers, especially with wider doors and priority seating giving people more leg room.|$|R
50|$|Splish Splash {{was built}} in 1989, headed by Chip Cleary with the {{original}} owners being the same as Adventureland. It opened in May 1991 with three body <b>slides,</b> <b>two</b> <b>speed</b> <b>slides,</b> <b>two</b> kiddie pools, two tube slides, a lazy river, and a restaurant. In 1995, the Lazy River opened. The park has been {{owned and operated by}} Palace Entertainment since 2001. Today the lazy river is 1300 ft long and is accompanied by 18 water slides, 2 wave pools, several kiddie attractions, and a spray and play pirate theme attraction. It spans over 90 acre. In 2006, Splish Splash added a new funnel-shaped ride called Alien Invasion. In July 2008, they announced that they would be adding 7 rides over the next few years, including Dr. Von Dark's Tunnel of Terror for 2009, Kahuna Bay for 2011, Bootlegger's Run for 2013, and The Battle of Mutiny Bay for 2014.|$|R
50|$|A <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> {{operator}} (or <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> opener or automatic <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> operator) is {{a device}} that operates a <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> for pedestrian use. It opens the door automatically, waits, then closes it.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> {{contain a}} motor and {{activation}} system to open them. These are called <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> operators. Automatic <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> are {{commonly found in}} offices and shop entrances. These doors contain a magnetic locking mechanism that automatically unlocks during emergencies.|$|R
50|$|A <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> {{is a type}} of door {{which opens}} {{horizontally}} by sliding, usually parallel to a wall. <b>Sliding</b> <b>doors</b> can be mounted either on top of a track below or be suspended from a track above and some types 'disappear' in a wall when slid open. There are several types of <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> such as pocket doors, Arcadia doors, and bypass <b>doors.</b> <b>Sliding</b> <b>doors</b> are commonly used as shower doors, glass doors, screen doors, wardrobe doors or in vans.|$|R
50|$|Generation III {{examples}} of the Town & Country with only the passenger side <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> (vs. both rear <b>sliding</b> <b>doors)</b> were only offered for 1996.|$|R

50|$|The {{fuel tank}} access door was {{installed}} {{on the right side}} for all versions sold internationally, however, for the LHD models, and the <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> was on the right side, care needed to be taken to avoid opening the <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> when fuel was being added to the fuel tank. An interlock prevented the <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> from opening too far when the fuel filler door was open.|$|R
25|$|Automatic <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> {{are open}} and closed either by power, spring, or by a sensor. This {{eliminates}} the need for a person to open or close a door by turning a doorknob or pressing up against a bar on the <b>door</b> itself. Automatic <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> are commonly found at entrance and exits of supermarkets, department stores, and airport terminals. In 1954, Dee Horton and Lew Hewitt co-invented the automatic <b>sliding</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R

50|$|To {{compensate}} {{for the lack of}} a driver's side <b>sliding</b> <b>door,</b> the edge of the driver's door was extended rearward six inches (152 mm), as {{it was not possible to}} create a driver's side <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> with the current body shell. When the Windstar was being designed in the early 1990s, Ford claimed that a driver's side <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> was not noted as a key feature indicated by focus groups; also at that time, minivans with that feature had sold very poorly.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} used {{to operate}} a <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> is called <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> gear. There are two standard types, top hung or bottom rolling systems. Both types {{do not have a}} perfect seal. To reduce air- and smoke-tightness and sound insulation, brush seals are commonly used.|$|R
50|$|A single {{compartment}} (with toilets) at the no.1 end of {{the carriage}} was reserved for ladies; {{at the opposite end}} of each car three compartments were reserved for smokers, with brass spitoons recessed into the floor. <b>Sliding</b> <b>doors</b> were fitted at every third compartment along the hallway, with an additional <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> to separate the five non-smoking from the single ladies' compartment. The partitions fitted with <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> were full-height and fitted with luggage racks overhanging the seats, while partitions between back-to-back seats were lower.|$|R

50|$|Opens {{normally}} like {{a traditional}} van <b>sliding</b> <b>door,</b> but unlike most <b>sliding</b> <b>doors</b> where the track ison {{the exterior of}} the vehicle, this type has it inside and {{on the side of the}} door itself. This allows the exterior to remain clean in design and yet the <b>door</b> can <b>slide</b> past the trailing edge of the car. However, this design is very unusual and can only be found on the Mitsubishi RVR (Space Runner, not ASX). Invented by Mitsubishi Motors, it was designed because the RVR is a short car compared to the size of the siding door, making it incapable of having a track on {{the exterior of the}} car. Thus, the inner-track mechanism was used so the <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> can <b>slide</b> open wide enough to let passengers enter and exit the car easily. The new Mitsubishi EK Wagon/Nissan Otti also uses this type of <b>sliding</b> <b>door,</b> but has it only on one side while the driver's side door of the back seats is a normal hinge <b>door.</b> The <b>sliding</b> <b>door</b> of the EK wagon is also electric-powered.|$|R

50|$|A typical ryokan has a {{relatively}} large entrance hall, with couches and chairs where guests can sit and talk; a modernized ryokan often has a television in the hall as well. Guest rooms are constructed using traditional Japanese methods: flooring is tatami, and <b>doors</b> are <b>sliding</b> <b>doors.</b> Even if the inn uses hinged doors for security, it usually opens into a small entranceway where guests can take off their shoes before stepping onto the tatami floor, which would be separated by a <b>sliding</b> <b>door.</b> Many ryokan rooms also feature a porch or balcony, also set off with a <b>sliding</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
