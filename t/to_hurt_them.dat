25|$|The use {{of animals}} in the circus has been {{controversial}} since animal welfare groups have documented instances of animal cruelty during the training of performing animals. Numerous instances of animal abuse in circuses have been documented such as confining enclosures, lack of regular veterinary care, abusive training methods and lack of oversight by regulating bodies. Animal trainers have argued that some criticism {{is not based on}} fact, including beliefs that shouting makes the animals believe the trainer is going <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>them,</b> that caging is cruel and common, and the harm caused by the use of whips, chains or training implements.|$|E

Time magazine reported the fedayeen had been warned in advance by Egyptian intelligence, and most of the 2,000 Arab commandos who used Karameh as a training base had pulled back into the surrounding hills to snipe at the Israelis. Some 200 guerrillas stayed inside to defend the town. [...] Later, Arafat's deputy, Abu Iyad, claimed in his memoirs that he and Arafat had been tipped off about the Israeli attack by Jordanian officers, who learned it from the CIA.|$|E

She states that Burt and Carole will be there, and that she hasn’t been talking with them {{recently}} (presumbably since Finn's death), and doesn’t want <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>them.</b> Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) reassure her that they’ll want her to move on, just like they did with their first spouses’ death. They both indeed support her to find love again with Sam. He officiates the wedding, which much to his surprise, his son is also getting married. He is in the flashback episode [...] "2009", which is set during the same time period as the show's pilot episode. Burt is contacted by McKinley High counsellor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) to tell him that Kurt seemed to be isolated and had shown interest in a pamphlet on suicide. Burt tells Kurt that he must join a school team within a week, or face punishment. Although Burt had meant a sports team, when Kurt enthusiastically tells Burt that he has join the glee club, he accepts this as an adequate substitute in part due to its competitive aspect. In the show's final episode, [...] "Dreams Come True", Burt and Carole attend the rededication ceremony of the McKinley High auditorium in the year 2020, when it is renamed the [...] "Finn Hudson Memorial Auditorium". He enjoys the final performance from the New Directions of all generations and take a bow with the other Glee Cast members.|$|E

500|$|According to Saadiq, {{the opening}} track [...] "Thinking of You" [...] is [...] "a really soul, southern, funky song" [...] {{inspired}} by Al Green. It has light guitar strokes and is sung in a Southern twang by Saadiq, while [...] "Top Notch" [...] features jazz elements and the vocalist's playful {{promise of a}} trip to Denny's for [...] "the most expensive dinner we can find". On [...] "Still a Man", he sings {{from the perspective of}} a man who was left by his wife to raise their children alone. The backing vocalists sing the meditative hook, [...] "Have you ever loved somebody / Who loves you so much it hurts you <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>them</b> so bad?" [...] On [...] "Holy Smokes & Gee Whiz", Saadiq's older brother Randall Wiggins sings lead. The song was described by Washington City Paper journalist Rickey Wright as a modernized version of the Stylistics' 1972 song [...] "Betcha by Golly, Wow", featuring [...] "a dead-on impression of Russell Thompkins' unmistakable falsetto and precise diction". [...] "Annie May" [...] was written by Wiggins as a story about a [...] "good girl next door" [...] who becomes an exotic dancer, while [...] "Let Me Know" [...] is a love song with Wall of Sound elements. According to Nick Krewen of The Spectator, [...] "Wild Child" [...] is [...] "a ballad in the grand sense" [...] of the 1977 Earth, Wind & Fire song [...] "Be Ever Wonderful". [...] "Party Don't Cry" [...] is a meditation on mortality with jazzy, philosophical overtones. Wright believed the song [...] "expresses an overt spirituality unheard in the Tonyies' past songs". The closing track is a gospel-influenced instrumental and variation of [...] "Lovin' You" [...] composed by Saadiq. Its sole lyric, according to Wright, is an universalist platitude.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{prominent}} example of lesbian slang is the rising reappropriation {{of the word}} [...] "dyke". Though still in many contexts considered pejorative, dyke {{has become a symbol}} for increasing acceptance of the lesbian movement and identity. Lesbians themselves use it to further solidarity and unity among their community. Examples include dyke marches (female-exclusive pride parades), [...] "dykes with tykes" [...] (describing lesbian motherhood), and Dykes on Bikes (a motorcycle group that traditionally leads the San Francisco Pride parade). Like other minorities, female homosexuals are slowly reclaiming a word that was once used <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>them</b> in the past. [...] This even had legal repercussions, in that the [...] "Dykes on Bikes" [...] group was formerly known as the [...] "Women's Motorcycle Contingent" [...] since they were refused the right to register under their preferred name by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, until 2006 when they finally were able to trademark the name, having persuaded the Office that [...] "dyke" [...] was not an offensive word.|$|E

Charles J. Cooper made an opening statement for the defendants, saying that marriage had been universally limited to opposite-sex couples.

2500|$|In his statements, Goetz {{described}} his past mugging, {{in which he}} was injured and the only assailant arrested went unpunished. He called New York City [...] "lawless" [...] and expressed contempt for its justice system, calling it a [...] "joke," [...] a [...] "sham," [...] and [...] "a disgrace". Goetz said that when the four men he shot surrounded him on the train, he feared being [...] "beaten to a pulp" [...] as well as being robbed. He denied any premeditation for the shooting, something that had been speculated on by the press. Asked what his intentions were when he drew his revolver, Goetz replied, [...] "My intention was to murder them, <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>them,</b> to make them suffer as much as possible." [...] Later in the tape, Goetz said, [...] "If I had more bullets, I would have shot 'em all again and again. My problem was I ran out of bullets."

[...] Sir John listened with tears rolling down his reddening cheeks and, unable to find the words in French, replied [...] "Damn it, I can't explain. [...] Tell him that all that men can do our fellows will do". [...] When Murray protested that the BEF could not be ready as soon as Joffre hoped, Joffre replied that Sir John's word was good enough for him. Joffre and Gamelin recorded Joffre's words slightly differently in their memoirs, as: [...] "il y a que l'honneur de l'Angleterre" [...] ("the honour of England (sic) is at stake"), but Spears' account more closely matches the contemporary diaries of Wilson and Clive, and so is in Prete's view more likely to be correct. Although Joffre had dealt tactfully with Sir John (he later claimed in his memoirs that his visit to Melun had simply been to congratulate Sir John on his willingness to co-operate), {{at a time when he}} sacked three of his own army commanders (including Lanrezac), ten corps commanders, and thirty-eight divisional commanders— Neillands writes that [...] "one cannot help wonder" [...] whether French would not have suffered the same fate had he reported directly to Joffre. Joffre believed at the time that the BEF were technically under his orders and that French's uncooperativeness was because the British government were too weak to insist that he obey orders. [...] French was conscious that he was Joffre's senior in rank and had more combat experience.|$|E

If the bird is a non-imprinted captive-bred, {{it is very important to}} establish in the bird's mind that the falconer will facilitate hunting, and thus food. The bird will be getting accustomed to its new 'furniture' (equipment) as well as its new owner.|$|R

He is also given the additional abilities to seal demon larvae and to create a barrier around a battle to keep the environment from being harmed by battles with the larvae.
