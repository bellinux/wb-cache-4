40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{examination}} of the potentially efficacy of a group based intervention called <b>the</b> <b>Girlfriends</b> Project, which specifically targeted African American women for HIV and STI education in the home. The premise of the project was that by having HIV discussions in an environment where women did not feel judged or intimidated, and where they were surrounded by "girlfriends," that the stigma attached to sex and HIV would be diminished. Because African American women suffered disproportionality for HIV and STIs, interventions that could effectively reduce the rate of infection among that population were greatly needed. Therefore, the public health significance of this essay was to evaluate whether <b>the</b> <b>Girlfriends</b> Project was an intervention that could fill that need. The hypothesis of this paper was that because <b>the</b> <b>Girlfriends</b> Project addressed a majority of the elements designated as necessary for behavioral change by the Social Cognitive Theory and the Theory of Gender and Power, <b>the</b> <b>Girlfriends</b> Project would be effective in reducing the incidence of HIV and STI among African American women by increasing the use of risk-reduction behaviors. In this paper the components of <b>the</b> <b>Girlfriends</b> Project were compared to each of the individual elements of the Social Cognitive Theory and the Theory of Gender and Power. From this comparison {{it was found that the}} components of <b>the</b> <b>Girlfriends</b> Project were in fact congruent with the elements of the both theories. From the apparent congruency, it was concluded that there appeared to be evidence that if widely disseminated <b>the</b> <b>Girlfriends</b> Project had <b>the</b> potential to be effective in changing the attitudes and social norms of African American women, which in turn would lead to behavior change that would reduce the incidence of HIV and STI among African American women. While the evidence supported the hypothesis of the efficacy of <b>the</b> <b>Girlfriends</b> Project there were several gaps in <b>the</b> <b>Girlfriends</b> Project where it could have more fully addressed the elements of the SCT and the TGP. Recommendations were provided which would allow <b>the</b> <b>Girlfriends</b> project to fill those gaps and more effectively achieve their goal...|$|R

On an episode in November 1996, when Sajak proved unable to host the bonus round segment because of laryngitis, he and White traded places for that segment. On the March 4, 1997 episode, Rosie O'Donnell co-hosted the third round with White after O'Donnell's name was used in a puzzle.|$|E

5|$|Hanson {{remained}} silent during the team's interviews while Hawk {{did most of}} the talking. The team won its first title on August 3, 1965, when they defeated Hiro Matsuda and Duke Keomuka to win the Florida version of the NWA World Tag Team Championship. They also competed in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, where they became the inaugural NWA Atlantic Coast Tag Team Champions.

5|$|In 2001, Ed Harris {{directed}} Connelly in the biopic Pollock {{in which}} she played Ruth Kligman, Jackson Pollock's mistress. In 2000 she appeared in what critics considered her breakthrough film, Requiem for a Dream, directed by Darren Aronofsky {{and based on the}} novel of the same name by Hubert Selby, Jr. Connelly played Marion Silver, <b>the</b> <b>girlfriend</b> of Harry, played by Jared Leto; the movie also starred Marlon Wayans and Ellen Burstyn. Her character is a middle-class girl from Manhattan Beach who pursues the dream of establishing a dress shop. She becomes addicted to heroin and descends into a life of prostitution. Connelly prepared for the role by renting an apartment in the building where the character lived. During her time in the apartment, Connelly isolated herself, painted, listened to music that she considered that her character would, designed clothes, and used the time to reflect about addictions and their origin. Connelly also talked to addicts and attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings with a friend who was in recovery. Critics acclaimed the individual performances for the actors' emotional courage in portraying physical and mental degradation. Connelly said she became interested in the script for its depiction of the addictions and their effects on the lives and affections of the characters and their relatives.|$|E

5|$|Staley met guitarist Jerry Cantrell at a {{party in}} Seattle around August 1987. A few months before that, Cantrell had watched a concert of Staley's then-band, Alice N' Chains, in his {{hometown}} at the Tacoma Little Theatre and was impressed by his voice. Cantrell was homeless after being kicked out of his family's house, so Staley invited Cantrell to live with him at the rehearsal studio Music Bank, and the two struggling musicians became roommates. Alice N' Chains soon disbanded, and Staley joined a funk band. Cantrell's band, Diamond Lie, broke up and he wanted to form a new band, so Staley gave him the phone number of Melinda Starr, <b>the</b> <b>girlfriend</b> of drummer Sean Kinney, so that Cantrell could talk to him. Cantrell called the number and set up a meeting with Kinney. Kinney and his girlfriend went to the Music Bank and listened to Cantrell's demos, who mentioned that they needed a bass player to jam with them, and he had someone in mind: Mike Starr, with whom Cantrell had played in a band in Burien called Gypsy Rose. Kinney then mentioned that his girlfriend was actually Mike Starr's sister, and that he had been playing in bands together with Starr since they were kids. Kinney called Starr and a few days later he started jamming with him and Cantrell at the Music Bank, but they didn't have a singer. Staley's funk band also required a guitarist at the time, and Staley asked Cantrell to join as a sideman. Cantrell agreed on condition that Staley join his band, because Cantrell, Starr and Kinney wanted Staley to be their lead singer, so they started auditioning terrible lead singers in front of Staley to send a hint. The last straw for Staley was when they auditioned a male stripper – he decided to join the band after that. Eventually the funk project broke up, and in 1987 Staley joined Cantrell's band on a full-time basis. Two weeks after the band's formation, they were playing a gig at the University of Washington, trying to fill out a 40-minute set with a couple of original material along with Hanoi Rocks and David Bowie covers.|$|E
