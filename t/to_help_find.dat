40|$|Individuals prefer helping {{some people}} more that others {{when it comes}} to finding a mate, and these {{preferences}} depend on whether long- or short-term mates are considered. Study 1 (N = 108) examined three theoretical frameworks (inclusive fitness, reciprocal altruism, and parental investment) for understanding why individuals would be more willing <b>to</b> <b>help</b> some individuals <b>find</b> mates instead of others. College participants reported how willing they were <b>to</b> <b>help</b> different types of individuals (e. g., sister, stranger) find a mate. When considering willingness <b>to</b> <b>help</b> others <b>find</b> a long-term mate, people preferred kin over nonkin, supporting an inclusive fitness model. However, when considering willingness <b>to</b> <b>help</b> others <b>find</b> short-term mates, people preferred helping people their own age, supporting a reciprocal altruism model. Study 2 (N = 143) replicated this age-cohort effect. Although rates of willingness <b>to</b> <b>help</b> others <b>find</b> mates were generally low, people were more likely <b>to</b> <b>help</b> others <b>find</b> a long-term mate than a short-term one...|$|R

5|$|The {{editorial}} work was largely done by Sloane, but Gernsback retained final say over the fiction content. Two consultants, Conrad A. Brandt and Wilbur C.

5|$|Multiple {{sequence}} alignments {{can also}} be used to identify functionally important sites, such as binding sites, active sites, or sites corresponding to other key functions, by locating conserved domains. When looking at multiple sequence alignments, it is useful to consider different aspects of the sequences when comparing sequences. These aspects include identity, similarity, and homology. Identity means that the sequences have identical residues at their respective positions. On the other hand, similarity has to do with the sequences being compared having similar residues quantitatively. For example, in terms of nucleotide sequences, pyrimidines are considered similar to each other, as are purines. Similarity ultimately leads to homology, in that the more similar sequences are, the closer they are to being homologous. This similarity in sequences can then go on <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>find</b> common ancestry.|$|E
5|$|Polio {{vaccination}} {{programs have}} received resistance from {{some people in}} Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria (the three countries with remaining polio cases). There is distrust surrounding vaccines in Pakistan as in 2011 the CIA organized a fake vaccination program in order <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>find</b> Osama Bin Laden. Additionally, some people believe that the vaccines are secretly being used for sterilization of Muslims. In 2015, the World Health Organization announced {{a deal with the}} Taliban to encourage them to distribute the vaccine in areas they control. However, on September 11, 2016, two unidentified gunmen associated with the Pakistani Taliban, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, shot Zakaullah Khan, a doctor who was administering polio vaccines in Pakistan. The leader of the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed responsibility for the shooting and says that the group will continue to keep doing these kinds of attacks. This resistance to and skepticism of vaccinations has consequently slowed down the polio eradication process within the three remaining countries.|$|E

Ephemer, however, abandons the player to explore the tower himself. During the player's exploration, the tower is discovered to be the base of the Foretellers, and while there, the player is confronted by Master Ava, the Foreteller they had met previously. She challenges the player to test their strength, and afterwards tells the player they have sadness in their hearts, which links them to the darkness. Undeterred, the player continues their mission and later meets another Keyblade wielder named , who comes from Ephemer's union. She expresses an interest in further exploring the mysterious tower of the Foretellers.

They finally decide to search in Bob's trailer at the dam construction site, and discover a briefcase full of cash. On being interrupted by Bob, the children run and hide inside the dam's turbine room, but are cornered. When confronted with the money, Bob denies knowing anything about it, stating that he's putting up his finances to build the dam walls out of concrete, but is distraught to see the walls empty and poorly constructed. The kids then believe that Bob is cutting back on construction materials by embezzling the money for himself, but Cecil shows up {{with a gun and}} reveals that {{he is the one who}} embezzled the money; now he plans on framing Bob and using him as a scapegoat when the poorly constructed dam collapses. He officially declares his greed of the money motivated him to enact his plan, though he privately admits to Bob that his true motivation was because of Bob being chosen as Krusty's sidekick instead of Cecil. Without hesitation, Cecil locks Bob, Bart and Lisa in the dam and prepares to blow it up, taking the money with him.|$|E
