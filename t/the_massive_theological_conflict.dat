50|$|The GPV {{was founded}} in 1948 {{as the result of}} a <b>theological</b> <b>conflict</b> within the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, which led to the {{creation}} of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (Liberated). In 1944 a group of orthodox Protestants left the Reformed Church, because they disagreed with Abraham Kuyper's view that God had created multiple branches of Christianity (Catholicism, Protestantism etc.), each with their own sphere.|$|R
50|$|In the <b>theological</b> <b>conflict</b> of {{the time}} he played a large part, doing what he could to mediate between the extremists. From 1559 to the close of his life he was {{superintendent}} general of the electorate of Saxony. He attained some fame as a hymn writer, his best-known composition being Wenn wir in höchsten Nothen sein. He died at Wittenberg on 10 December 1569.|$|R

40|$|Although the {{students}} of Prague’s Charles University are mostly remembered for starting the Velvet Revolution in the 20 th Century, the university’s history of revolution started nearly seven hundred years earlier with a young priest named Jan Hus.

40|$|Intellectual {{property}} rights afford inventors, and authors {{in the case}} of copyright, protection from imitation and give rights holders substantial discretion over how to use or license their intellectual property. Antitrust laws prohibit arrangements that restrain competition. There is an apparent conflict between the two regimes. One body of law promotes higher prices by excluding at least some competition, while the other body of law promotes lower prices by prohibiting conduct that limits competition. Courts, practitioners, academics, and enforcement agencies have attempted to reconcile the apparent conflict by noting the rewards of the intellectual property system also enhance competition by creating incentives to develop new products and processes. 1 Nevertheless, the large number of antitrust cases in both the US and the EU involving intellectual property and the confusing opinions in many of these cases suggest that the boundaries that define the scope of intellectual property and antitrust law are far from clear, indeed, the differences between antitrust-centric and patentcentric lawyers, economists and academics are suggestive of a <b>theological</b> <b>conflict.</b> The indicia of <b>theological</b> <b>conflict</b> include: (i) strong beliefs that either a strong patent system or * University of California at Berkeley.

25|$|Multiple {{denominations}} {{experienced a}} split from 1861 until 1865 {{due to the}} ongoing political climate but also slavery. Often to distinguish these denominations the word Southern was used. Hence, for denomination that remained in the North the word Northern was used. Examples include Southern Presbyterians and Northern Presbyterians, Southern Baptists and Northern Baptists, Southern Episcopalians and Northern Episcopalians, {{and so on and}} so forth. Such splits entailed no <b>theological</b> <b>conflicts</b> or doctrine changes, and adjectives Southern/Northern were only used to describe one's base in the Confederacy/the Union, territorial scope, political allegiance/preferences or stance on slavery.|$|R
2500|$|With the {{exception}} of Pope Martin I, no pope during this period questioned {{the authority of the}} Byzantine monarch to confirm the election of the bishop of Rome before consecration could occur; however, <b>theological</b> <b>conflicts</b> were common between pope and emperor in the areas such as monotheletism and iconoclasm. Greek speakers from Greece, Syria, and Byzantine Sicily replaced members of the powerful Roman nobles in the papal chair during this period.

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} the Emperor Theodosius II (408 - 450) at the <b>theological</b> <b>conflict</b> that emerged during his government and got notorious by historiography as Nestorian Controversy. Such a conflict was led by the bishops Cyril of Alexandria and Nestorius of Constantinople, who diverged about the relationship established between the divine and human natures of the incarnate Christ. Since theological formulations of such nature were used in Late Antiquity to support ideological formulations of sustaining and unity of the imperial power, we aim to highlight the role of centrality of the Emperor as a mediator in this conflict...|$|R
2500|$|During the 17th century, Europe was {{undergoing}} expansive social, cultural, and economic growth, {{known as the}} Dutch Golden Age in the Netherlands. [...] Nations vied for domination of lucrative trade routes around the globe, particularly those to Asia. Simultaneously, philosophical and <b>theological</b> <b>conflicts</b> were manifested in military battles across the continent. [...] The Republic of the Seven United Netherlands had become a home to many intellectuals, international businessmen, and religious refugees. In the Americas, the English had a settlement at Jamestown, the French had small settlements at Port Royal and Quebec, and the Spanish were developing colonies to exploit trade in South America and the Caribbean.|$|R
50|$|Theologically, the {{position}} {{is a little}} more complex. Followers of the Assyrian Church of the East, Ancient Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Assyrian Pentecostal Church and Assyrian Evangelical Church usually adhere to an Assyrianist position, although sometimes the term Chaldo-Assyrian is used to avoid <b>theological</b> <b>conflict</b> between Assyrian followers of the original Church of the East and those who broke away between the late 17th and early 19th centuries and entered communion with the Roman Catholic Church, which named this new church the Chaldean Catholic Church in 1830. Chaldean Catholics {{should not be confused with}} ancient Chaldeans, a long extinct people with whom they share no links.|$|R

5|$|Justinian {{entered the}} arena of ecclesiastical statecraft shortly after his uncle's {{accession}} in 518, {{and put an end}} to the Acacian schism. Previous Emperors had tried to alleviate <b>theological</b> <b>conflicts</b> by declarations that deemphasized the Council of Chalcedon, which had condemned Monophysitism, which had strongholds in Egypt and Syria, and by tolerating the appointment of Monophysites to church offices. The Popes reacted by severing ties with the Patriarch of Constantinople who supported these policies. Emperors Justin I (and later Justinian himself) rescinded these policies and reestablished the union between Constantinople and Rome. After this, Justinian also felt entitled to settle disputes in papal elections, as he did when he favoured Vigilius and had his rival Silverius deported.|$|R
2500|$|Arius {{is notable}} {{primarily}} because of {{his role in the}} Arian controversy, a great fourth-century <b>theological</b> <b>conflict</b> that rocked the Christian world and led to the calling of the first ecumenical council of the Church. [...] This controversy centered upon the nature of the Son of God, and his precise relationship to God the Father. [...] Leading up to the council of Nicaea, the Christian world had many different competing Christological formulae. After Nicaea, the dominant orthodox worked to conceal the earlier disagreement, portraying [...] "Arianism" [...] as a radical disagreement to the [...] "norm". The Nicaean formula was a rapidly concluded solution to the general Christological debate that did not have prior agreement.|$|R
50|$|The Zahiri Revolt was a {{conspiracy}} leading to a failed coup d'état against {{the government of the}} 14th-century Mamluk Sultanate, having been characterized as both a political struggle and a <b>theological</b> <b>conflict.</b> While the initial support for the potential overthrow of the sultan began in Egypt, movement of Egyptian ideological agitators to Syria eventually caused the actual planned uprising to take place in Damascus in 1386. Rallying around Ahmad al-Zahiri, a cleric of the Zahirite school of Sunni Islam, the agitators mobilized from Hama to the capital. Having failed to secure the support of both the Mamluks and local Arab tribes, they were arrested by the authorities of Barquq before armed conflict could even take place.|$|R
50|$|As a Southern diocese, {{historically}} Mississippi parishes and missions have {{leaned toward}} evangelical, or low church, practice {{over the course}} of the diocese's history. However, unlike most of the other major religious traditions in the state, the Episcopal Church in Mississippi has usually tolerated freedom of belief and differing types of ritual practice (e.g., Anglo-Catholicism in Biloxi and a liberal orientation in communities like Oxford and Starkville where colleges have significant presences). As such, the fallout from the ideological and <b>theological</b> <b>conflicts</b> that beset the Episcopal Church between the 1970s and 2000s (such as the Gene Robinson controversy) has not been large in comparison to other Southern dioceses (e.g., Tennessee, Fort Worth, South Carolina).|$|R

5|$|The 1925 General Assembly {{faced the}} threat of schism over {{the actions of the}} Presbytery of New York. Attempting to deescalate the situation, General Assembly {{moderator}} Charles Erdman proposed the creation of a special commission to study the church's problems and find solutions. The commission's report, released in 1926, sought to find a moderate approach to solving the church's <b>theological</b> <b>conflict.</b> In agreement with the Auburn Affirmation, the commission concluded that doctrinal pronouncements issued by the General Assembly were not binding without the approval of a majority of the presbyteries. In a defeat for conservatives, the report was adopted by the General Assembly. Conservatives were further disenchanted in 1929 when the General Assembly approved the ordination of women as lay elders.|$|R
25|$|By the 4th century Christianity {{had spread}} to {{numerous}} regions. A number of influential schools of thought had arisen, particularly the Alexandrian and Antiochian philosophical approaches. Other groups, such as the Arians, had also managed to gain influence. However, their positions caused <b>theological</b> <b>conflicts</b> within the Church, thus prompting the Emperor Constantine {{to call for a}} great ecumenical synod in order to define the Church's position against the growing, often widely diverging, philosophical and theological interpretations of Christianity. He made it possible for this council to meet not only by providing a location, but by offering to pay for the transportation of all the existing bishops of the Church. Most modern Christian Churches regard this synod, commonly called the First Council of Nicaea or more generally the First Ecumenical Council, as of major importance.|$|R
50|$|In the 16th century, as {{many cities}} in Prussia became Lutheran, the {{population}} began {{to seek a}} Lutheran education. The University of Königsberg in neighbouring Ducal Prussia, founded in 1544, was not big enough to educate all the new Protestant clerics and administrators needed for the newly Lutheran state in addition to arrivals from the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, so local Latin schools in the Commonwealth were upgraded. The future home of the Gymnasium would be the former Franciscan monastery turned into a school. In 1539, a Schola Dantiscana program was started by Andreas Aurifaber. In 1558 Johann Hoppe founded a secular gymnasium that would become the Academic Gymnasium Danzig. Achatius Curaeus (1531-1594), from the University of Wittenberg, was made the first rector, but due to the <b>theological</b> <b>conflicts</b> between Gnesio-Lutherans and Philippists, he soon left.|$|R
50|$|Theoria is {{the main}} aim of hesychasm, which, under the {{influence}} of St. Symeon the New Theologian, developed out of the practice of quietism. Symeon believed that direct experience gave monks the authority to preach and give absolution of sins, without the need for formal ordination. While Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience, and met with strong resistance for his charismatic approach, and his support of individual direct experience of God's grace. According to John Romanides, this difference in teachings on the possibility to experience God or the uncreated light is {{at the very heart of}} many <b>theological</b> <b>conflicts</b> between Eastern Orthodox Christianity and Western Christianity, which is seen to culminate in the conflict over hesychasm.|$|R
5000|$|In 1540 {{the church}} became the {{property}} of The Crown once again when King Henry VIII abolished the Knights Hospitaller in England and confiscated their property. Henry provided a priest for the church under the former title [...] "Master of the Temple".

Shakespeare was familiar with the site and the church and garden feature in his play Henry VI, part 1 as the setting for the fictional scene of the plucking of two roses of York and Lancaster and the start of the Wars of the Roses. In 2002 this event was commemorated with the planting of new white and red roses in the modern gardens.|$|R

50|$|From {{the middle}} of the 5th century onward, {{increasingly}} arduous tasks confronted the emperors of the East in ecclesiastical matters.

50|$|Orthodox theologians {{assert that}} the {{theological}} division of East and West culminated into a direct <b>theological</b> <b>conflict</b> known as the Hesychasm controversy during several councils at Constantinople New Rome, between the years 1341-1351. They argue that this controversy highlighted the sharp contrast between what is embraced by the Roman Catholic Church as proper (or orthodox) theological dogma and how theology is validated and what is considered valid theology by the Eastern Orthodox. The essence of the disagreement {{is that in the}} East a person cannot be a genuine true theologian, or teach knowledge of God, without having experienced God, as is defined as the vision of God (theoria). At the heart of the issue was the teaching of the Essence-Energies distinctions (which states that while creation can never know God's uncreated essence, it can know his uncreated energies) by Gregory Palamas.|$|R
5000|$|Stevie Davies in The Independent writes [...] "Gee's {{gentle and}} {{restrained}} story celebrates {{the sanctity of}} the ordinary and the beauty of holiness. In a cynical age, such innocent writing is startling. Simplicity of heart and the hearth's pieties represent an ideal under threat...This novel, categorically, ought not to work. It treats us to passages of Scripture and chunks of liturgy. The dialect characters ought to be shot ("Minna Davies! How be thee keeping this long time?"). The archaic <b>theological</b> <b>conflicts</b> have little sharpness. However, the novel transcends all this. Its clement and often sombre prose intelligently gratifies a taste for romance. The Marches countryside and homely interiors are Vermeer-ish. The relationship between husband and wife is the novel's most memorable aspect: the dignified cleric is reduced to childlike vulnerability as he enters into a consciousness of death." ...|$|R

2500|$|According to 19th-century German theologian F. C.

However, <b>theological</b> <b>conflict</b> between Paul and Peter is recorded in the New Testament and was widely discussed in the early church. Marcion and his followers stated that the polemic against false apostles in Galatians was aimed at Peter, James and John, the [...] "Pillars of the Church", as well as the [...] "false" [...] gospels circulating through the churches at the time. Irenaeus and Tertullian argued against Marcionism's elevation of Paul and stated that Peter and Paul were equals among the apostles.
