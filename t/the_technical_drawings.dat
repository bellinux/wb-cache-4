50|$|The North German baroque organ in Örgryte Nya Kyrka is a {{pipe organ}} in Gothenburg, Sweden. It was built within a {{research}} project at GOArt, University of Gothenburg and dedicated on August 12, 2000. The goal {{of the project was}} to recreate the construction techniques and design philosophies of 17th-century German organbuilder Arp Schnitger. Even though the instrument was built in the style of this single builder it was not modeled after a single instrument. No single model could be used since no large Schnitger organ has been preserved in original condition. The construction of the organ was carried out by an international team of organ builders. Henk van Eeken was responsible for the design and <b>the</b> <b>technical</b> <b>drawings,</b> Munetaka Yokota for the pipe work and Mats Arvidsson oversaw the building process. The instruments contains almost 4000 pipes and is the largest existing organ tuned in quarter-comma meantone.|$|E

The drawings are: never executed Bielsko-Biała waterworks project by engineer Grahn (1887) with the aim to build water intake on the River Soła in Kęty-Podlasie, the project of waterworks for the City of Biała with water intake in Straconka by engineer Pfister (1898), and the project of the dam in Wapienica by Dyckerhoff & Widmann company (1927). <b>The</b> <b>technical</b> <b>drawings</b> are complemented by various postcards, photos and archives available thanks to National Archives in Katowice, Bielsko-Biała branch as well as a few old water meters.|$|E
50|$|Varo’s father, Rodrigo Varo y Zajalvo, was an {{intellectual}} {{man who had}} a strong influence on his daughter’s artistic development. Varo would copy the blueprints he brought home from his job in construction, and he helped her further develop her technical drawing abilities. He encouraged independent thought and supplemented her education with science and adventure books, notably the novels of Alexandre Dumas, Jules Verne, and Edgar Allan Poe. As she grew older, he provided her with text on mysticism and philosophy. Varo’s mother, Ignacia Uranga Bergareche, was born to Basque parents in Argentina. She was a devout Catholic and commended herself to {{the patron saint of}} Anglès, the Virgin of Los Remedios, promising to name her first daughter after the saint. Her father was a hydraulic engineer, and the family traveled the Iberian Peninsula and into North Africa. To keep Remedios busy during these long trips, her father had her copy <b>the</b> <b>technical</b> <b>drawings</b> of his work with their straight lines, radii, and perspectives, which she reproduced faithfully. As a child, she read much with favorite authors including Jules Verne, Edgar Allan Poe, and Alexandre Dumas. She also read books about oriental philosophy and mysticism. Those first few years of her life left an impression on her that would later show up in motifs like machinery, furnishing, artifacts, and Romanesque and Gothic architecture unique to Anglès.|$|E

50|$|Unlike the Präsident, {{the first}} {{passenger}} car made by NW, the original of the First Truck has not survived. After {{the work on}} Präsident passenger car replica was finished in 1977, the decision was taken to build {{a replica of the}} First Truck. After all, the main production of the Tatra company were the trucks at the time. However the task was more complicated than in case of Präsident, as there was also lack of original technical documentation. There was one original photograph of the truck's side view, but this one was made after partial reconstruction of the original. Very important was the photographic tablet of the original technical description, this one was however representing a later truck, which was made on May 22, 1900, and which had only one engine (instead of the two installed on the first truck), different gear box and a different steering. Only the concept of the front and rear axles, cooling, the frame and chassis itself were the same. The last source for the project was a description given by a Viennese editor named Adolf Schmal jnr., who described in a newspaper the truck he saw in Nesselsdorf in spring of 1899. Fortunately his description was very detailed. There were also 39 usable original technical drawings: another 702 had to be made from scratch. <b>The</b> <b>technical</b> <b>drawings</b> for the engine, electrics, and fuel tank were taken from those for the Präsident. The replica is made from 1333 pieces. More than 500 enthusiastic Tatra employees took part {{in the construction of the}} replica after working hours. The replica was finished in autumn of 1979. The First Truck replica can by now seen in Tatra Technical Museum in Kopřivnice.|$|E
5000|$|The central square, named 4 November and {{recently}} restructured, {{is the heart}} of the activities and the life of Fornaci. It accommodates the main events of the village and provides a meeting place for people in their free time, thanks also to the adjacent gelateria, bars, pubs and restaurants. The central square opens onto the Via Repubblica, the main street of the village on which are situated many shops, giving rise to the slogan “100 shops having a single display window”. On some festival days, for example May 1 and June 2, the road is closed to traffic and transformed into a pedestrian area. The church of Christ Redentore, constructed in a modern style, is the main church of Fornaci. It is located in the centre of the village, in Don Minzoni square. Monsignor Matteucci, archbishop of Pisa, blessed its foundation stone on May 22, 1971 and consecrated the church on September 27, 1974. The church was built on land given to the parish by Società Metallurgica Italiana which also donated copper for the roof. Remarkable inside the church is the mosaic of Christ. The notable bronze covering of the main door of the church is the work of professor Franco Pegonzi http://www.francopegonzi.it/, created in commemoration of the Holy Jubilee Year 2000 http://www.parrocchie.it/fornacidibarga/porta_santa.htm. In the neighbourhood of the church is located the pretty park [...] "Felice Menichini" [...] with a playground for children and a general purpose sports field for others. The church of Santissimo Nome di Maria in Fornaci Vecchia was erected in 1741 and is of more traditional architecture. It is loved by those people who prefer old memories and slightly less adventuristic architecture. The church became a parish church in 1923 and an “arcipretura” in 1962. Of indisputable beauty is the Romanesque pieve of Saint Maria Assumpta in Loppia. Probably already built in the 6th century, it is certain that the pieve was restored at the beginning of the second millennium at the request of countess Beatrice di Canossa and was reconsecrated on Saturday February 4, 1058 by the bishop of Lucca, Anselmo da Baggio, the future Pope Alexander II. A museum has been created in what was once the research centre of Società Metallurgica Italiana. This museum, of national importance, is managed by the Ing. Luigi Orlando Foundation and contains the correspondence, the archive documents, <b>the</b> <b>technical</b> <b>drawings</b> and samples of machinery that was used in the several plants of the group and is of great value, both historically and culturally. One of the curiosities, certainly not for its artistic value, which should be mentioned is the [...] " [...] fontanina dell' amore", surrounded by nature in the northern part of the village. A poem by the poet Geri di Gavinana has been dedicated to this fountain and to the lovers who visit it looking for a secluded place. A plaque positioned on the fountain reminds the poem. Because Fornaci lies in a part of the country which is rich in history and of unspoilt natural beauty and far from mass tourism, and because it has its own tourist facilities, it is ideal as a base for touring the Media Valle del Serchio and Garfagnana.|$|E
