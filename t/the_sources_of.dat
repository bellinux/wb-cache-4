5|$|Trade {{was a key}} {{component}} of Maya society, and {{in the development of the}} Maya civilization. The cities that grew to become the most important usually controlled access to vital trade goods, or portage routes. Cities such as Kaminaljuyu and Q'umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands, and Chalchuapa in El Salvador, variously controlled access to <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> obsidian at different points in Maya history. The most important cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula controlled access to <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> salt. In the Postclassic, the Maya engaged in a flourishing slave trade with wider Mesoamerica.|$|E
5|$|Data {{from the}} Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere {{satellite}} suggests that noctilucent clouds require water vapour, dust, and very cold temperatures to form. <b>The</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> both {{the dust and}} the water vapour in the upper atmosphere are not known with certainty. The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the stratosphere.|$|E

5|$|The {{coronation}} of Æthelstan {{took place}} on 4 September 925 at Kingston upon Thames, perhaps due to its symbolic location {{on the border between}} Wessex and Mercia. He was crowned by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Athelm, who probably designed or organised a new ordo (religious order of service) in which the king wore a crown for the first time instead of a helmet. The new ordo was influenced by West Frankish liturgy and in turn became one of <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> the medieval French ordo.|$|E
5|$|The {{rings of}} Neptune, {{like those of}} Uranus, {{are thought to be}} {{relatively}} young; their age is probably significantly less than that of the Solar System. Also, like those of Uranus, Neptune's rings probably resulted from the collisional fragmentation of onetime inner moons. Such events create moonlet belts, which act as <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> dust for the rings. In this respect the rings of Neptune are similar to faint dusty bands observed by Voyager 2 between the main rings of Uranus.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh's teachings {{focus on}} the unity of God, religion, and mankind. Similar to other monotheistic religions, God is {{considered}} {{the source of all}} created things. Religion, according to Bahá'u'lláh, is renewed periodically by Manifestations of God, people who are made perfect through divine intervention and whose teachings are <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> the major world religions throughout history. Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh as the first of these teachers whose mission includes the spiritual unification of the entire planet through the eradication of racism and nationalism. Bahá'u'lláh's teachings include the need for a world tribunal to adjudicate disputes between nations, a uniform system of weights and measures, and an auxiliary language that could be spoken by all the people on earth. Bahá'u'lláh also taught that the cycles of revelatory renewal will continue in the future, with Manifestations of God appearing every thousand years or so.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Catherine's ukase of 1788, just as other nations were {{entering}} the maritime fur trade, the Russians had spent over 40 years establishing and expanding their maritime operations in North America. A number of colonies were being established over a large region stretching from the Aleutian Islands to Cook Inlet and Prince William Sound. Many ships sailed from Kamchatka to Alaska each year. The Russians not only had an early start, but they also controlled the habitats {{of the most valuable}} sea otters. The Kurilian, Kamchatkan, and Aleutian sea otters' fur was thicker, glossier, and blacker than those on the Northwest Coast and California. The four grades of fur were based on color, texture, and thickness. The most prized furs were those of Kurilian and Kamchatkan sea otters, Aleutian furs were second grade, those of the Northwest Coast third, and the poorest grade was those of Californian sea otters. Russia also controlled <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> sable furs, the most valuable fur-bearing land mammal.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{its status}} an {{international}} language, English is expeditious {{when it comes}} adopting foreign words, and borrows vocabulary from {{a large number of}} other sources. Early studies of English vocabulary by lexicographers, the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality linguistic corpora, collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published {{before the end of the}} 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.|$|E

Filitti had few visiting friends, among them Alexandru Filitti-Robănești, teacher Alexandru Pisoschi, historians Emanoil Hagi-Moscu and G. D. Florescu. He was however in constant correspondence with other scholars who shared his passions, including Greek jurist Panagiotis Zepos, His Majesty's Antiquarian G. T. Kirileanu, bibliophile Constantin Karadja, regional historian G. Poboran, academician-priest Nicolae M. Popescu and Hungarian archivist Endre (Andrei) Veress. In addition to the anti-Germanophile Nicolae Iorga, his rivals in academia included a new generation of leading historians, who were targets of his polemical articles: Gheorghe I. Brătianu, George Fotino, Constantin C. Giurescu and P. P. Panaitescu.
