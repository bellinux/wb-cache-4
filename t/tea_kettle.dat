Du Maurier {{was quoted}} as saying she called Lawrence by the {{nickname}} [...] "Cinders," [...] short for Cinderella. Either while negotiating to appear in September Tide or rehearsing it, Lawrence stayed in [...] "a flat in London somewhere," [...] according to what du Maurier told Morley decades later. Boiling water in her <b>tea</b> <b>kettle</b> for a visitor was stressful for Lawrence. Du Maurier also told the biographer that she had forgotten all the dialogue she had written for September Tide and that shortly before her interview with Morley she had [...] "been searching my shelves for a copy of the play. ... I cannot remember how Cinders looked, what she wore, far less what she said." [...] Du Maurier's contribution to the Morley biography of Lawrence consists of little more than that.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, LAMP archaeologists {{discovered}} the second oldest shipwreck in northeast Florida waters, an unidentified colonial sailing vessel {{known as the}} [...] "Storm Wreck". The wreck site, completely buried when initially discovered, has been subject to excavations each summer from 2010 to 2012, and seems to consist of scattered remnants of cargo, ship's equipment and components, military hardware, and personal possessions. LAMP archaeologists, along with volunteer and student divers, have documented and recovered {{a wide range of}} well-preserved artifacts, including numerous iron and copper cauldrons, pewter spoons and plates, an iron <b>tea</b> <b>kettle,</b> ceramic and glass fragments, belt and shoe buckles, a brass candlestick, bricks, a flintlock Queen Anne pistol, three Brown Bess muskets (two of which were loaded, one with buck and ball), thousands of lead shot, military buttons (including one from a Royal Provincial unit and one from the 71st Regiment of Foot, Fraser's Highlanders), a cask of nails, tools and navigational equipment (including a sight from an octant), ship's hardware and rigging elements, the ship's lead deck pump, a bronze ship's bell, a 4-pounder cannon, and a 9-pounder carronade, believed to be the second oldest in the world. After three seasons of excavation and laboratory analysis of artifacts, it is believed that this vessel was a ship involved in the December 18, 1782, evacuation of Charleston {{at the end of the}} American Revolution, carrying Loyalist refugees and troops to St. Augustine, which was a loyal British colony at the time. This was the final British fleet to leave Charleston, and when it arrived between December 24 and 31, 1782, as many as sixteen vessels were lost on the sandbar in front of the St. Augustine inlet. In 2015-2016 LAMP discovered three additional historic shipwrecks, and is currently excavating one of these that appears to date to the second half of the 18th century, the so-called [...] "Anniversary Wreck." ...|$|E

In whistling <b>tea</b> <b>kettles,</b> when the steam building up in the container of the kettle tries to escape, it causes vibrations to occur within the chamber.

6000|$|This {{interest}} was further increased by the graphic account that honest John Buzzby gave {{of the death}} of poor Mrs Ellice, and the enthusiastic way in which he spoke of his old captain. Fred, too, had, by his frank, affable manner, and somewhat reckless disposition, rendered himself a general favourite with the men, and had particularly recommended himself to Mivins the steward (who was possessed of an intensely romantic spirit), by stating once or twice, very emphatically, that he (Fred) meant to land on the coast of Baffin's Bay, should the captain fail to find his father, and continue the search on foot and alone. There was no doubt whatever that poor Fred was in earnest, and had made up his mind to die in the search, rather than not find him. He little knew the terrible nature of the country in which for a time his lot was to be cast, and the hopelessness of such an undertaking as he meditated. With boyish inconsiderateness he thought not of how his object was to be accomplished; he cared not what impossibilities lay in the way, but with manly determination he made up his mind to quit the ship and search for his father through the length and breadth of the land. Let not the reader smile at what he may perhaps style a childish piece of enthusiasm. Many a youth, at his age, has dreamed of attempting as great if not greater impossibilities. All honour, we say, to the boy who dreams impossibilities, and greater honour to him who, like Fred, resolves to attempt them! James Watt stared at an iron <b>tea</b> <b>kettle</b> till his eyes were dim, and meditated the monstrous impossibility of making that kettle work like a horse; and men might (perhaps did) smile at James Watt then; but do men smile at James Watt now--now that thousands of iron kettles are dashing, like dreadful comets, over the length and breadth of the land, not to mention the sea, with long tails of men, and women, and children behind them? ...|$|E

50|$|Revere Ware {{is a line}} of {{consumer}} and commercial kitchen wares introduced in 1939 by the Revere Brass & Copper Corp. Focusing primarily on consumer cookware such as (but not limited to) skillets, sauce pans, stock pots, and <b>tea</b> <b>kettles.</b> Initially Revere Ware {{was the culmination of}} various innovative techniques developed during the 30's, the most popular being construction of Stainless Steel with rivetlessly attached bakelite handles, copper clad bases and rounded interiors for ease of cleaning. Over the next 40+ years, Revere Ware would introduce new series to position itself in competition with other manufacturers at various price points, or for specific specialty markets. In the early 60's the profitability of Revere Ware began to level off. Coinciding with new series introductions, cost cutting measures were implemented in the manufacture of the traditional cookware. The bakelite handles were changed from two piece to one, and the thickness of utensil walls and copper cladding were reduced.|$|R

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{application}} of the so-called global approaches, arising from the field of hydrodynamical instabilities, to aeroacoustic resonators. We illustrate the potential of the approach for the case of a jet passing through two successive holes (”hole-tone” configuration) which is relevant to human whistling, birdcalls and <b>tea</b> <b>kettles.</b> First, treating the hydrodynamic system as locally incompressible and linearized around a base flow, we compute the conductance of the double aperture and show that this one can provide positive energy feedback to an external system. Secondly, introducing the coupling with an acoustical resonator through convenient impedances imposed as boundary conditions and solving an eigenvalue problem, we show that the full system is e ectively linearly unstable and able to support self-sustained oscillations. The results compare favorably with recent experiments, and the analysis yields novel insight into the nature of the feedback mechanism responsible for the whistling. The application to the related situation of a corrugated pipe, and to more realistic instruments such as ocarinas and free reeds, will also be discussed...|$|R
