PCA used {{only a few of}} training images <b>to</b> <b>verified</b> an unknown image so it can reduce the time that waste to train the training images. The concept that used in this verification method is to compared the weight of training images with the weight of test image...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Abstract interpretation-based model {{checking}} {{provides an}} approach <b>to</b> <b>verifying</b> properties of infinite-state systems. In practice, most previous work on abstract model checking is either restricted <b>to</b> <b>verifying</b> universal properties, or develops special techniques for temporal logics such as modal transition systems or other dual transition systems. By contrast we apply completely standard techniques for constructing abstract interpretations to the abstraction of a CTL semantic function, without restricting {{the kind of}} properties that can be verified. Furthermore we show that this leads directly to implementation of abstract model checking algorithms for abstract domains based on constraints, making use of an SMT solver. ...|$|R

5|$|Empiricist David Hume's {{requirement}} that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the logical positivist movement, particularly the philosopher A. J. Ayer. The movement proposed that, for {{a statement to}} hold meaning, it must be possible <b>to</b> <b>verify</b> its truthfulness empirically– with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible <b>to</b> <b>verify.</b> Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued {{that he could not}} have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher Antony Flew proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that, in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.|$|E

40|$|In {{this section}} we propose giving LOTOS {{programs}} a temporal semantics, i. e. the temporal logic formula expressing {{the properties of}} their execution sequences. The advantages of the temporal semantics approach when providing the semantics for concurrent programs {{can be summed up}} in the following observations: i) verifying that a program satisfies a given property (expressed by a temporal logic formula) is reduced <b>to</b> <b>verifying</b> that the formula expressing the temporal meaning of the program logically implies the given property formula. ii) verifying the equivalence of programs is reduced <b>to</b> <b>verifying</b> logic equivalence. These observations make it possible to unify these two verification problems, as they amount to checking the validity of a logic formula. Here mechanic tools can help, such as decision procedures and theorem provers...|$|R
