5|$|After his {{accession}} to the throne, King Rama VI occasionally stayed at <b>the</b> <b>palace.</b> King Rama VII stayed at <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> {{for a few}} nights before his coronation in 1925, while King Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII) made <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> his main place of residence upon his return to Thailand from Switzerland in December 1945. He lived in this palace with his younger brother Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej (later King Rama IX) and his mother Princess Sri Sangwan. On the morning of 9 June 1946 <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> bore witness to his mysterious and unexplained death by gunshot. King Rama IX later refurbished <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> and added an extra wing extending south.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} kingdom period, <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> {{controlled}} the economy, but wealthy families managed their financial affairs without government intervention. The economic system was redistributive; <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> distributed food to its permanent and seasonal workers. It {{is estimated that}} around 40,000 persons contributed to this system, but in general, and unlike in Mesopotamia, land stayed {{in the hands of}} villages, which paid an annual share to <b>the</b> <b>palace.</b> Agriculture was mainly pastoral; large herds of cattle were managed by <b>the</b> <b>palace.</b> The city's inhabitants owned around 140,000 head of sheep and goats, and 9,000 cattle.|$|E
5|$|During the war, Adolf Hitler {{presented}} <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> as {{a reward}} to Field Marshal Erich von Manstein, who made it personal headquarters. This explains why <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> was so well preserved. The building was later converted into a museum for Wehrmacht officers stationed in and around Crimea. Originally, the Nazis had planned to dynamite <b>the</b> <b>palace,</b> but the rapid advance of the Separate Coastal Army and supporting Yalta partisan groups during the Crimean Offensive saved <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> from destruction.|$|E

50|$|Building of <b>the</b> <b>palaces</b> on <b>the</b> {{western side}} of the square started in 1750. When Eigtved died in 1754 <b>the</b> two western <b>palaces</b> had been completed.

5|$|From the mid-Heian period, <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> {{suffered}} several {{fires and}} other disasters. During reconstructions, emperors {{and some of}} the office functions resided outside <b>the</b> <b>palace.</b> This, along with the general loss of political power of the court, acted to further diminish the importance of <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> as the administrative centre. Finally in 1227 <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> burned down and was never rebuilt. The site was built over so that almost no trace of it remains. Knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> is thus based on contemporary literary sources, surviving diagrams and paintings, and limited excavations conducted mainly since the late 1970s.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Palace</b> of Whitehall, to {{the east}} of the road, was {{originally}} named York Palace, but was renamed during the reign of Henry VIII. <b>The</b> <b>palace</b> was redesigned in 1531–32 and became the King's main residence later in the decade. He married Anne Boleyn here in 1533, followed by Jane Seymour in 1536, and died at <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> in 1547. Charles I owned an extensive art collection at <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> and several of William Shakespeare's plays had their first performances here. It ceased to be a royal residence after 1689, when William III moved to Kensington Palace. <b>The</b> <b>palace</b> was damaged by fire in 1691, following which the front entrance was redesigned by Sir Christopher Wren. In 1698, most of <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> burned to the ground accidentally after a fire started by a careless washerwoman.|$|E

A hall at the top floor that was used as a leisure room overlooks the Karakoram mountain range and the lawns around <b>the</b> <b>palace.</b> Other notable rooms of <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> include the Royal meeting room (Chogoraftal), Royal balcony (Chogojarokh), Princess dressing room (Lainakhang), and Queen room.|$|E
5|$|Work on <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> {{began in}} 1747 under Portuguese {{architect}} Mateus Vicente de Oliveira. Despite being far smaller, <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> {{is often referred}} to as the Portuguese Versailles. From 1826, <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> slowly fell from favour with the Portuguese sovereigns. In 1908, it became the property of the state. Following a serious fire in 1934, which gutted one-third of the interior, <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> was extensively restored, and today is open to the public as a major tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|According to Moberly and Jourdain, the {{two women}} decided to visit <b>the</b> <b>Palace</b> of Versailles as part of several trips. On 10 August 1901, they {{travelled}} by train to Versailles.

5|$|Additionally, Darius {{sponsored}} large {{construction projects}} in Susa, Babylon, Egypt, and Persepolis. In Susa, Darius {{built a new}} palace complex {{in the north of}} the city. An inscription states that <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> was destroyed during the reign of Artaxerxes I, but was rebuilt. Today only glazed bricks of <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> remain, the majority of them in the Louvre. In Pasargadae Darius finished all incomplete construction projects from the reign of Cyrus the Great. A palace was also built during the reign of Darius, with an inscription in the name of Cyrus the Great. It was previously believed that Cyrus had constructed this building, however due to the cuneiform script being used, <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> {{is believed to have been}} constructed by Darius.|$|E
5|$|After {{completion}} of <b>the</b> <b>palace,</b> Hunt remained at Alupka {{working on an}} assortment of projects {{in and around the}} estate building long carriage drives, roads and structural improvements to the gardens surrounding <b>the</b> <b>palace.</b> One of his largest projects was an extension to <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> itself, the Shuvalov wing, which was to be the summer retreat of the Vorontsov's daughter Countess Sofia Shuvalova and her children, the countess was estranged from her husband This wing linked <b>the</b> <b>palace</b> to the western gatehouse, and created the enclosed Shuvalov Passage leading to the main entrance. Hunt remained in the Prince's employ until his retirement in 1852.|$|E
5|$|After the {{destruction}} by fire of <b>the</b> <b>Palace</b> of Whitehall in 1698, the surroundings of the Privy Garden changed dramatically.

With the demise of the Privy Gallery, the Privy Garden was extended north to include the Pebble Court behind the Banqueting House.|$|E

5|$|By the 18th century, {{traffic was}} {{struggling}} {{along the narrow}} streets south of Holbein Gate, which led to King Street Gate being demolished in 1723. Holbein Gate, in turn, was demolished in 1759. Meanwhile, Parliament Street was a side road alongside <b>the</b> <b>palace,</b> leading to <b>the</b> <b>Palace</b> of Westminster. After <b>the</b> <b>Palace</b> of Whitehall was destroyed, Parliament Street was widened to match Whitehall's width. The present appearance of the street dates from 1899 after a group of houses between Downing Street and Great George Street were destroyed.|$|E
