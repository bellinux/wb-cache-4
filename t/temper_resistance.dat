In the present study, the different aspects associated with the steel properties as related to the milling cutter body application are reviewed. The working performance of a tool holder depends in particular on the fatigue strength, high temperature properties and machinability of the tool steel used. Rotating tools, tool {{going in and out}} of cutting engagement, impose dynamic stresses and require adequate fatigue strength off the tool. Different publications, as well as internal investigation at Uddeholm Tooling AB show that the working temperatures of milling cutter bodies in the insert pocket vary from 300 to 600 degrees Celsius depending on the cutting conditions and material of the workpiece. As a result, steel for this application needs good hot properties such as high <b>temper</b> <b>resistance,</b> high hot hardness values, etc. Machinability is also essential as machining of steel represents a large fraction of the production cost of a milling cutter.

The overall {{aim of this}} work has been to investigate the precipitation during secondary hardening of these low-chromium steels using electron microscopy and atom probe. Modelling and experimental evaluation was also done {{in order to see}} if it is possible to add nitrogen to low-chromium steel and still get secondary hardening. The steels was analyzed as-hardened as well as tempered. With no nitrogen added the secondary precipitates were found to be MC and M 2 C with mixed compositions regarding vanadium, molybdenum and chromium. In the as-hardened state there was some auto-tempering, resulting in the precipitation of ε-carbide and M 3 C. When tempering at 625 ºC for 2 + 2 hours the microstructure is peppered with small (< 5 nm) secondary precipitates and after slight overtempering there had been some coarsening. However, there was still large amounts of very small precipitates, which indicates that there had been further precipitation during the overtempering. With the nitrogen addition the modelling suggested that the M(C,N) phase would be difficult to dissolve much during austenitizing, but it also predicted {{that there would be a}} potential for secondary precipitation. The three trial alloys confirmed that the hardening response was lowered as the nitrogen level was increased; and all three alloys had clear secondary hardening during high temperature tempering.

40|$|Chromium {{martensitic}} hot-work {{tool steel}} (AISI H 13) {{is commonly used}} as die material in hot forming techniques such as die casting, hot rolling, extrusion and hot forging. They are developed to endure the severe conditions by high mechanical properties attained by a complex microstructure. Even though the hot-work tool steel has been improved {{over the years by}} alloying and heat treatment, damages still occur. Thermal fatigue is believed {{to be one of the}} most common failure mechanisms in hot forming tools. In this thesis tools used in hot forging and die casting were examined to determine damage, material response, thermal fatigue crack initiation and propagation. Different chromium martensitic hot-work tool steels, heat treated at four different austenitizing temperatures were experimentally tested in thermal fatigue and isothermal fatigue. The materials were then evaluated using X-ray line broadening analysis and transmission electron microscopy to explore the relation between fatigue softening and the change in microstructure. The high temperature fatigue softening was also simulated using an elasto-plastic, non-linear kinematic and isotropic model. The model was implemented in a numerical simulation to support the integration of die design, tool steel properties and its use. It was found that the dominant damage mechanisms in the investigated tools were thermal fatigue and that tool material experiences a three stage softening at high temperature loading. The primary stage was concluded to be influenced by the dislocation density and the second stage by the <b>temper</b> <b>resistance</b> i. e. carbide morphology. The microstructural changes during the softening stages were also connected to the non-linear kinematic and isotropic model.

40|$|Large {{improvements}} in cutting tool design and technology, including {{the application of}} advanced surface engineering treatments on the cemented carbide insert, have been achieved in the last decades to enhance tool performance. However, the problem of improving the tool body material is not adequately studied. Fatigue {{is the most common}} failure mechanism in cutting tool bodies. Rotating tools, tool {{going in and out of}} cutting engagement, impose dynamic stresses and require adequate fatigue strength of the tool. Working temperatures of milling cutter bodies in the insert pocket can reach up to 600 °C depending on the cutting conditions and material of the workpiece. As a result, steel for this application shall have good hot properties such as high <b>temper</b> <b>resistance</b> and high hot hardness values to avoid plastic deformation in the insert pocket of the cutting tool. Machinability of the steel is also essential, as machining of steel represents a large fraction of the production cost of a milling cutter. This thesis focus on the improvement of the cutting tool performance by the use of steel grades for tool bodies with optimized combination of fatigue strength, machinability and properties at elevated temperatures. The first step was to indentify the certain limit of the sulphur addition for improved machinability which is allowable without reducing the fatigue strength of the milling cutter body below an acceptable level. The combined effect of inclusions, surface condition and geometrical stress concentrator on the fatigue life of the tool steel in smooth specimens and in tool components were studied in bending fatigue. As the fatigue performance of the tools to a large extent depends on the stress relaxation resistance at elevated temperature use, the second step in this research was to investigate the stress relaxation of the commonly used milling cutter body materials and a newly steel developed within the project. Compressive residual stresses were induced by shot peening and their response to mechanical and thermal loading as well as the material substructures and their dislocation characteristics were studied using X-ray diffraction. Softening resistance of two hot work tool steels and a newly developed steel was investigated during high temperature hold times and isothermal fatigue and discussed of with respect to their microstructure.

40|$|Performance of {{indexable}} insert {{cutting tools}} {{is not only}} about the performance of cutting inserts. It is also about the cutting tool body, which has to provide a secure and accurate insert positioning as well as its quick and easy handling under severe working conditions. The common damage mechanisms of cutting tool bodies are fatigue and plastic deformation. Cutting tools undergo high dynamic stresses going in and out cutting engagement; as a result, an adequate level of fatigue strength is the essential steel property. Working temperatures of tool bodies in the insert pocket can reach up to 600 °C, why the tool steel requires high softening resistance to avoid plastic deformation. Machinability is also essential, as machining of the steel represents a large fraction of the production cost of a cutting tool. The overall aim of the study is to improve the tool body performance by use of an advanced steel grade with an optimized combination of all the demanding properties. Due to the high-temperature conditions, the thesis concerns mostly hot-work tool steels increasing also the general knowledge of their microstructure, mechanical properties and machinability. Knowing the positive effect of sulphur on machinability of steels, the first step was to indentify a certain limit of the sulphur addition, which would not reduce the fatigue strength of the tool body below an acceptable level. In tool bodies, where the demand on surface roughness was low and a geometrical stress concentrator was present, the addition of sulphur could be up to 0. 09 wt%. Fatigue performance of the cutting tools to a large extent depended on the steel resistance to stress relaxation under high dynamic loading and elevated temperatures. The stress relaxation behaviour, material substructure and dislocation characteristics in low-alloyed and hot-work tool steels were studied using X-ray diffraction under thermal and mechanical loading.  Different tool steels exhibited different stress relaxation resistance depending on their microstructure, <b>temper</b> <b>resistance</b> and working temperature. Hot-work tool steels showed to be more preferable to low-alloyed tool steels because of their ability to inhibit the rearrangement and annihilation of induced dislocations. High-temperature softening resistance of the hot-work tool steels was investigated during high-temperature hold-times and isothermal fatigue and discussed with respect to their microstructure. Carbide morphology and precipitation were determined using scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Machinability of a prehardened hot-work tool steel of varying nickel content from 1 to 5 wt% was investigated in end milling and drilling operations. Machining the higher nickel containing steels resulted in longer tool life and generated lower cutting forces and tool/workpiece interface temperature. The difference in machinability of the steels was discussed in terms of their microstructure and mechanical properties. ...|$|E

Post-tempering examinations of the super-bainitic samples showed that low temperature tempering cycles (400 – 500 °C) resulted in carbides formation, and some increases in the hardness possibly due to precipitation strengthening in the Co & Al contained steel. Once the tempering temperature increased to 600 °C, the hardness plummeted in both steels due to the concurrent coarsening of the bainitic ferrite plates and more precipitation of carbides. At the higher tempering temperature of 700 °C, further reduction in the hardness occurred because of the accelerated recovery of ferrite and spheroidization of carbides.

40|$|The {{addition}} of molybdenum to steel welds in quite small concentrations {{leads to a}} variety of anomalous microstructural and mechanical property effects. In some cases, the effects manifest even when there are no obvious changes in microstructure at the resolution of a transmission electron microscope. There are two particular discrepancies. A quantitative analysis of molybdenum-containing steel welds indicates that there is a degree of strengthening which cannot be explained by the known solid solution or microstructural effects of molybdenum in steels. Secondly, in multirun welds, the {{addition of}} molybdenum appears to make the microstructure which evolves during solidification (the primary microstruet 1 lre) extremely stable. These and other associated phenomena are examined in this thesis. The molybdenum effects mentioned above have been reproduced in detail, using a series of 'high-purity' multirun welds. Having confirmed that molybdenum increases the fraction of primary microstructure in such welds, an attempt was made to see whether the effect is attributable to a change in the austenitisation characteristics with alloying additions. Extensive work using dilatometric techniques backed by microscopy analysis has demonstrated that molybdenum does not lead to any substantial or unexpected changes in the ability to form austenite. The second hypothesis, that the primary microstructure is stabilised as molybdenum increases the <b>tempering</b> <b>resistance,</b> is proven and provides a good explanation of the observations. A series of tempering experiments have established that the anomalously high strength of the molybdenum containing welds cannot be attributed to solid solution strengthening or microstructural effects. Indeed, it appears that there is a submicroscopic secondary hardening type effect which enhances the strength. Even the thermal treatment that occurs as the weld cools from the solidification temperature is shown to be sufficient to induce molybdenum based secondary hardening type effects. Some preliminary atomic resolution effects also lend support to this concept. Titanium as a trace element is important in steel welds, as an element which promotes the intragranular nucleation of acicular ferrite on titanium-rich phases. It is demonstrated that the titanium effect is not intrinsically different for molybdenumcontaining welds. However, the extra hardenability associated with molybdenum certainly helps to suppress the formation of other grain boundary nucleated phases which might swamp events that occur on the inclusions within the grains. An interesting observation is that titanium has a positive effect in limiting the grain boundary nucleated phases, because the intragranularly nucleated acicular ferrite to some extent stifles the formation of other phases...|$|R

Here we show that NOTCH 1 regulates the expression of PTEN (encoding phosphatase and tensin homolog) and the activity of the phosphoinositol- 3 kinase (PI 3 K) -AKT signaling pathway in normal and leukemic T cells. Notch signaling and the PI 3 K-AKT pathway synergize in vivo in a Drosophila melanogaster model of Notch- induced tumorigenesis, and mutational loss of PTEN is associated with human T- ALL resistance to pharmacological inhibition of NOTCH 1. Overall, these findings identify transcriptional control of PTEN and regulation of the PI 3 K-AKT pathway as key elements of the leukemogenic program activated by NOTCH 1 and provide the basis for the design of new therapeutic strategies for T- ALL...|$|R
40|$|In this {{research}} work the welded surface suing submerged arc weld overlay cladding technique is investigated {{to determine which}} sample mixture has higher hardness, higher wear resistance at various conditions. The materials used for surface layering of base metal is of different waste material powders collected for the research purpose and these powders are mixed in various proportions to prepare five samples. Samples are tested for hardness after welding using Rockwell hardness test and then the samples are cut into three different parts for further examination. Microstructure examination is done is {{this research}} using microscope that has maximum magnification range of 250 x. Wear test is performed using the wear testing machine for which the samples are cut into 6 mm length small piece These three parts are used as each for analyzing the hardness, inspecting the microstructure and calculating the wear <b>resistance.</b> <b>Tempering</b> of the samples are done to investigate whether at which tempering temperature {{the efficiency of the}} samples are increasing and also to evaluate the value it is increasing. The results obtained from these tests are studied, analyzed and investigated in this work and the usefulness of the waste material powder are assessed...|$|R

6000|$|... 182. But we {{do worse}} than this. Within {{the last few}} years some sense of the real {{tendency}} of such teaching has appeared in some of our younger painters. It only could appear in the younger ones, our older men having become familiarized with the false system, or else having passed through it and forgotten it, not well knowing the degree of harm they had sustained. This sense appeared, among our youths,--increased,--matured into resolute action. Necessarily, to exist at all, it needed the support both of strong instincts and of considerable self-confidence, otherwise it must at once have been borne down by the weight of general authority and received canon law. Strong instincts are apt to make men strange and rude; self-confidence, however well founded, to give much of what they do or say the appearance of impertinence. Look at the self-confidence of Wordsworth, stiffening every other sentence of his prefaces into defiance; there is no more of it than was needed to enable him to do his work, yet it is not a little ungraceful here and there. Suppose this stubbornness and self-trust in a youth, laboring in an art of which the executive part is confessedly to be best learnt from masters, and we shall hardly wonder that much of his work has a certain awkwardness and stiffness in it, or that he should be regarded with disfavor by many, even the most temperate, of the judges trained in the system he was breaking through, and with utter contempt and reprobation by the envious and the dull. Consider, further, that the particular system to be overthrown was, in the present case, one of which the main characteristic was the pursuit of beauty at the expense of manliness and truth; and it will seem likely à priori, that the men intended successfully to resist the influence of such a system should be endowed with little natural sense of beauty, and thus rendered dead to the temptation it presented. Summing up these conditions, there is surely little cause for surprise that pictures painted, in a <b>temper</b> of <b>resistance,</b> by exceedingly young men, of stubborn instincts and positive self-trust, and with little natural perception of beauty, should not be calculated, at the first glance, to win us from works enriched by plagiarism, polished by convention, invested with all the attractiveness of artificial grace, and recommended to our respect by established authority.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyses {{resistance to}} a regional development programme, which centred {{on the construction}} of a dam at Cerro de Oro, Ojitlan, Oaxaca, Mexico and the resettlement of the affected Chinantec population into an area of Uxpanapa, Veracruz. The resistance of the people of Ojitlan took various forms over a seven year period (1972 - 9), including political action, a syncretic millenarian movement, a reassertion of traditional forms of community fiestas and passive resistance to resettlement. Ojitlan has been affected by national economic and political changes since before the Spanish Conquest. Large plantations established in the tropical lowland areas in the 19 th century ceded place to small "ejido" communities, set up under land reform in the 1930 s. Control of land and the economic relationships of production are seen as factors affecting the patterns of resistance in Ojitlan. The dissertation reviews the anthropological literature on resistance and on ethnicity. The series of forms of resistance studied can be seen as multiple cultural articulations - attempts to "bridge the gap" between the established Ojitec life and the "modern" systems of work and life introduced by the development project of the Papaloapan River Commission. The Ojitec struggle with modernity involved dealing not just with the question of resettlement in the collective ejidos of Uxpanapa, but also with the reforms promoted in the Oaxacan Catholic Church. The traditional ritual of indigenous Catholicism offered a sphere of legitimate agency and autonomy for the Ojitec in the face of new models of agency and power. The dissertation suggests the usefulness of the concept of <b>resistance,</b> <b>tempered</b> with an analysis of accompanying processes of accommodation to change. Evidence from the 1990 s indicates that ethnic identity continues to be important in political resistance to the state in Uxpanapa, a sign of the resilience of forms of Ojitec culture...|$|R
40|$|The {{mainstreaming}} of {{the optional}} Transition Year (TY) programme in 1994 {{was a significant}} innovation in Irish second-level schooling. TY offers schools and teachers extensive freedom to devise imaginative curricula with a particular emphasis on personal and social development and education for citizenship. In this study, an historical perspective identifies ambiguous attitudes to TY since its origins in 1974. The relevant literature on key concepts associated with schools as organisations, educational innovation and resistance, young people’s learning, school leadership and teacher development is reviewed. A central focus of the study involves exploring the attitudes to TY of students, parents, teachers and school leaders {{using a combination of}} qualitative and quantitative methods. A consistent pattern through the emerging data is that students are more mature {{as a result of the}} TY experience. Young people’s confidence grows, student-teacher relationships are enhanced and opportunities to explore adult and working life are seen as distinct benefits. Individual schools tend to domesticate TY according to their particular histories, traditions, values and contexts. Domestication involves highlighting features of the TY guidelines that fit with schools’ existing identities and neglecting others. The quality of school leadership, particularly by principals and TY co-ordinators, is identified as critically important for effective implementation of the programme. Parents’ attitudes to TY tend to be positive, though they consistently express a desire for more information about the programme. TY’s relationship with other second-level programmes is seen as problematic and significant tensions are identified. The second part of the research involved seeking the perceptions of and attitudes to TY of senior personnel in nine key agencies involved in the making, shaping and implementing of education policy were sought. Discussion resulting from both sets of data examines paradoxical positions where some features of TY are embraced and others resisted. Policy weaknesses are seen as contributing to ambiguous attitudes. Enthusiasm for the innovation is <b>tempered</b> by covert <b>resistance</b> that isolates TY in a type of parallel universe and ensures the hegemony of existing arrangements in schools, notably, the established Leaving Certificate programme and the associated ‘points system’. Current practices which ensure that some young people benefit from six years of second-level schooling and other receive five is seen as unjust and deserving of policy-makers’ urgent attention. Policy implications of the findings, particularly for teachers’ professional development, are discussed...|$|R
