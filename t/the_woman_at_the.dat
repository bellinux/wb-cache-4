5|$|Come to the Well is {{the fifth}} studio album by American {{contemporary}} Christian band Casting Crowns, released on October 18, 2011 through Beach Street and Reunion Records. The album, which has a predominantly pop rock and rock sound, {{was based on the}} Biblical story of <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> well. In writing the album, lead vocalist Mark Hall collaborated with songwriters Steven Curtis Chapman, Matthew West, and Tom Douglas. The album received mostly positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised the album's songwriting, and received the award for Top Christian Album at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards.|$|E
5|$|Edward and Karl find {{a fork in}} {{the road}} and travel down {{separate}} paths. Edward follows a path through a swamp and discovers the secret town of Spectre, the cheery locals claiming he was expected. There, he befriends Ashton poet Norther Winslow and the mayor’s daughter Jenny. However, Edward leaves Spectre, unwilling to settle down but promises Jenny he will return. In the present day, Joséphine speaks to the bed-ridden Edward and asks him to tell her the story of how he met his wife Sandra, with Will listening outside the door. Returning to his reminisces, Edward reunites with Karl and they visit the Calloway Circus, where Edward {{falls in love with a}} beautiful woman. Karl and Edward get jobs in the circus where the ringmaster Amos Calloway reveals to Edward one detail about <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of every month.|$|E

25|$|Ziegler's {{presence}} allows Kubrick {{to change}} {{the mechanics of the}} story in a few ways. In the film, Bill first meets his piano-playing friend at Ziegler's party, and then while wandering around town, seeks him out at the Sonata Café. In the novella, the café encounter with Nightingale is a delightful coincidence. Similarly, the dead woman whom Bill suspects of being <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> party who saved him is a baroness that he was acquainted with earlier, not a hooker at Ziegler's party.|$|E
500|$|Musical styles {{from abroad}} have been merged with {{pre-existing}} Malagasy musical traditions to create distinctly Malagasy sounds with foreign roots. [...] An {{example of this}} is the Afindrafindrao, a tune based on the French quadrille that was popularized in the Malagasy court in the 19th century. [...] A specific form of partner dance accompanies this piece, in which dancers will form a long chain of male-female pairs with <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front of each pair, both facing forward holding each other's hands while advancing to the rhythm of the music. [...] From its origins as a courtly dance, the afindrafindrao today is a quintessentially Malagasy tradition performed {{at the beginning of a}} social event or concert to kick off the festivities.|$|E
500|$|To try {{to change}} the public {{backlash}} related to the alleged 1999 rape, The Birth of a Nations studio hired The Glover Park Group and Don McPherson to give Parker media training and public relations advice. [...] Despite this media and public relations training, industry sources stated, [...] "They gave him talking points and he just didn't execute". [...] The same sources also noted that, while [...] "Parker seemed at times to understand the need to emphasize his sorrow about the devastating impact of the 1999 encounter on <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> center of the charges, sources say when the cameras rolled he reverted to his original position." [...] In an October 2016 60 Minutes interview, Parker maintained that he was innocent of the crime and that he did not feel guilty about it, but conceded that, {{from the perspective of a}} 36-year-old man, he had done something morally wrong.|$|E

2500|$|Although he {{attended}} performances of Wagner's operas, {{he was much}} more interested in the music than the plot.

But she [...] "stated not knowing where the switch was located." [...] BC Ferries' report {{questions}} the validity of this evidence [...] "as the autopilot disengages simply with a single switch {{and would have been}} operated numerous times by the [...]" [...] However, in its own report, BC Ferries states the master found it necessary to post a note for navigational crew on how to operate the autopilot and included procedures for changing modes. Evidence was given that <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> wheel didn't know the location of the ship when she took over as lookout--or that the ferry was about to crash until she saw trees. She said she was asked to make only one, maybe two small course changes as directed by the fourth officer after she started her shift but that was...until just before the vessel hit Gil Island.|$|E
2500|$|... {{collection}} <b>The</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Washington Zoo was published. [...] Starting {{with this}} book, Jarrell broke free of Auden's influence {{and the influence}} of the New Critics and developed a style that mixed Modernist and Romantic influences, incorporating the aesthetics of William Wordsworth in order to create more sympathetic character sketches and dramatic monologues. The scholar Stephen Burt notes, [...] "Jarrell took from Wordsworth the idea that poems had to be 'convincing as speech' before they were anything else." [...] His final volume, The Lost World, published in 1965, continued in the same style and cemented Jarrell's reputation as a poet; many critics consider it to be his best work. Stephen Burt states that [...] "in the 'Lost World' poems and throughout Jarrell's oeuvre[...] [...]he took care to define and defend the self [...] [...] [...]his lonely personae seek intersubjective confirmation and [...] [...] [...]his alienated characters resist the so-called social world." [...] Burt identifies the chief influences on Jarrell's poetry to be [...] "Proust, Wordsworth, Rilke, Freud, and the poets and thinkers of Jarrell's era [...]" ...|$|E

Little, however, is known about disclosure of abuse in community and in clinical settings. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore whether there was a difference in the disclosure of abuse experience among women who were attending the emergency department (ED) at Landspitali University Hospital or were located at a university site, that is, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University Square <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Iceland. A cross-sectional research design was used.

A significantly higher proportion of <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ED reported that they were victims of IPV in their current marital/partner relationship and scored higher on <b>the</b> <b>Women</b> Abuse Screening Tool total scale than <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> university site. This gave a clear indication that <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ED experienced significantly more frequent and more severe IPV in their current marital/partner relationship compared with <b>the</b> <b>women</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> university site.
