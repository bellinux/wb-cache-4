25|$|All of the Bayou Operations were failures, but Grant {{was known}} for his {{stubborn}} determination and would not quit. His final option was bold but risky: March the army down {{the west side of the}} Mississippi, cross the river south of Vicksburg, and either attack Vicksburg from the south and the east or join forces with Banks, capture Port Hudson, and then together reduce Vicksburg. Porter would have to sneak past the guns to get sufficient gunboats and transport ships south of the city. Once they had completed the downstream passage, they would not be able to return past Vicksburg's guns because the river current would slow <b>them</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2005, a flag-to-flag {{rule for}} MotoGP was introduced. Previously, if a race started dry and rain fell, {{officials}} could red-flag (stop) {{the race and}} either restart or resume on 'wet' tyres. Now, when rain falls, a white flag is shown, indicating that riders can pit to swap the motorcycle on which they started the race for an identical one, {{as long as the}} tyres are different (that is, intermediates or slicks instead of wets). Besides different tyres, the wet-weather bikes have steel brake rotors and different brake pads instead of the carbon discs and pads used on the 'dry' bikes. This is because the carbon brakes need to be very hot to function properly, and the water cools <b>them</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> The suspension is also 'softened' up somewhat for the wet weather.|$|E
500|$|Mahathir {{wrote an}} open letter to the Tunku, accusing him of [...] "giving the Chinese what they demand ... you have given <b>them</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> face." [...] Soon, {{students}} at higher educational institutions across the country began to hold mass demonstrations, calling for the Tunku to step down in favour of a leader who would restore [...] "Malay sovereignty". Sporadic rioting, believed to have been instigated by the Tunku's opponents, broke out.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of The Curse of the Black Pearl, the {{challenge}} to creating a sequel was, according to Verbinski, [...] "You don't want just the Jack Sparrow movie. It's like having a garlic milkshake. He's the spice and you {{need a lot of}} straight men... Let's not give <b>them</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> Jack. It's like too much dessert or {{too much of a good}} thing." [...] Although Dead Man's Chest was written to propel the trilogy's plot, Sparrow's state-of-mind as he is pursued by Davy Jones becomes increasingly edgy, and the writers concocted the cannibal sequence to show that he was in danger whether on land or at sea. Sparrow is perplexed over his attraction to Elizabeth Swann, and attempts to justify it throughout the film.|$|E
500|$|Children {{generally}} {{remained in}} the direct care of their mothers {{until the age of}} about eight years old, after which time it was not uncommon for the child to be placed in the foster care of another family. There were any number of reasons for a child to be [...] "put-out" [...] in this manner. Some children were placed into households to learn a trade, others to be taught to read and write. It seems that there was a theological reason for fostering children, as with almost every decision in the colony. It was assumed that children's own parents would love <b>them</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> and would not properly discipline them. By placing children in the care of another family, there was little danger of them being spoiled.|$|E
500|$|Matsui {{had told}} friends {{before going to}} Sugamo Prison that at the IMTFE he planned to defend not only himself but also Japan's wartime conduct as a whole. Matsui insisted that Japan had acted defensively against {{aggression}} by foreign powers and that Japan's war aims were to liberate Asia from Western imperialism. Concerning {{the origins of the}} Second Sino-Japanese War, Matsui called it [...] "a fight between brothers within the 'Asian family'" [...] and stated that the war was fought against the Chinese, not [...] "because we hate them, but on the contrary because we love <b>them</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> It is just the same in a family when an elder brother has taken all that he can stand from his ill-behaved younger brother and has to chastise him in order to make him behave properly." ...|$|E

500|$|Ferguson in his {{autobiography}} said a major turning point in his relationship with Wenger was after the Champions League semi-final of 2009; the Arsenal manager invited his competitor into the dressing room and congratulated him on United's win. Wenger admitted their relationship had become genial since his team stopped competing with Manchester United for trophies. The move to the Emirates Stadium in 2006 is often cited as the reason why, given it coincided with a transitional phase for the club. Several experienced first teamers were displaced in favour of youth and the style of football became shifted more towards ball retention. Ferguson assessed the change in philosophy proved that Wenger did not [...] "like to blend <b>them</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> with older players;" [...] he also felt the team lacked a much needed balance between attack and defence.|$|E
500|$|Investigations {{were held}} in various states, {{including}} Arkansas, Michigan, and Missouri, which led to lawsuits that accused brokers of illegally reselling tickets from the Best of Both Worlds Tour. [...] "When you allow the hijacking of the market, it's literally the worst of both worlds. You get charged too much, and there's no access for the locals", said Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon. Numerous ticket brokers accessed tickets prior to fans {{as a result of}} a software program by RMG Technologies Inc, which permitted its clients to circumvent Ticketmaster.com's CAPTCHA access controls, and use the copyrighted website in a manner that violated the site's [...] "Terms of Use". Ticketmaster took legal action against RMG Technologies via the United States District Court for the Central District of California, claiming that the developed software for ticket brokers illegally [...] "allows them to cut in line". RMG Technologies representative denied the allegations and said they should not be held accountable because Ticketmaster is getting still paid for the tickets. [...] "This may be the only time in history that any seller sued its customers for paying <b>them</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> money", the attorney for RMG Technologies wrote in court documents.|$|E
500|$|Soon after, Barker, Corbett and Josephine Tewson {{performed}} a sketch about Henry VIII at the 1971 BAFTAs, with Barker playing Henry. The two {{also had to}} keep the audience entertained for eight or so minutes as the show was stopped because of technical difficulties. Their performance at the award show impressed the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment Bill Cotton and Controller of BBC One Paul Fox, who {{were sitting in the}} audience. Not knowing they were both essentially unemployed, although still contracted to Paradine, Cotton signed the duo up for their own show together, and a series each on their own; he later joked he [...] "must have offered <b>them</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> money." [...] Barker and Corbett wished to avoid being remembered primarily as a duo, and felt they could not work {{in the same way as}} a conventional double act like Morecambe and Wise, and so each maintained their solo careers as well. They each were given a one-off variety special; Barker's, called The Ronnie Barker Yearbook, featured a sketch for each month of the year, although because of time constraints the first two had to be cut. Barker also reprised his character Lord Rustless in the sitcom His Lordship Entertains in 1972. Barker wrote all seven episodes, again with the pseudonym Jonathan Cobbald.|$|E
50|$|The {{tropical}} {{pocket gopher}} has a diploid number of 38. This is {{low compared to}} similar species. This could help them adapt to their restricted habitat.

2500|$|In Game 2, Curt Schilling gave up one run in 5 innings, and Hideki Okajima and Jonathan Papelbon {{finished}} the game flawlessly. [...] This time, the dominance was necessary, as the Red Sox scored two times, with Jason Varitek driving in Mike Lowell in the fourth, then Lowell driving in David Ortiz {{in the fifth}} for their only offense of the game. [...] With a 2–1 Game 2 win, the Red Sox went to Coors Field in Denver with the advantage, hoping the rarefied air would not affect <b>them</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Of {{the entire}} cast, only Eastwood was an {{established}} actor; the Hmong actors had relatively little experience, {{and some were}} not proficient in English. Jeff Baenen said that Eastwood used a [...] "low-key approach to directing." [...] Eastwood said that [...] "I’d give them little pointers along the way, Acting 101. And I move along {{at a rate that}} doesn’t give <b>them</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> of a chance to think." [...] Bee Vang said that he originally felt fright, but was able to ease into the acting. Baenen said that Eastwood was a [...] "patient teacher" [...] of the first-time actors. According to Vang, Eastwood did not say [...] "action" [...] whenever filming a particular shoot began.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2008, the Republican Movement {{suggested}} electing the Governor-General as {{an interim}} step to a republic, arguing [...] "Electing the Governor-General allows for easier {{transition to a}} republic, because the populace is used to electing someone as a ceremonial de facto head of state." [...] With {{the introduction of the}} Governor-General Act 2010, Green MP Keith Locke suggested Parliament recommend the next Governor-General's appointment to the Queen, with a recommendation endorsed by three-quarters of parliament. In its submission to the select committee considering the Bill, the Republican Movement suggested parliament appoint the next Governor-General with a three-quarters majority plus a majority of party leaders in parliament, with a similar dismissal process and a fixed five-year term. National MP Nikki Kaye queried whether several one-member parties in parliament could veto the decision, which could give <b>them</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> power if an appointment was based on one vote per leader. The Republican Movement responded that the method would ensure appointments were made that most MPs and parties found acceptable.|$|E
60|$|What may we suppose is {{the reason}} of this great stillness and soberness of the gospels? I believe {{that it may be}} {{explained}} thus. The men who wrote <b>them</b> were <b>too</b> <b>much</b> awed by our Lord, to make more words about him than they absolutely needed.|$|R

2500|$|Ismail's {{reputation}} for fairness but uncompromising toughness – at one point, he declared he would arrest {{his own mother}} if she had broken the law – has been cited {{by a number of}} top officials as greatly contributing to stability {{in the wake of the}} riots. During this period, several Malay [...] "ultras" [...] such as Mahathir bin Mohamad and Musa Hitam called for the resignation of the Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman. Mahathir penned an open letter to the Tunku, accusing him of [...] "giving the Chinese what they demand ... you have given <b>them</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> face." [...] Soon, students at higher educational institutions across the country began to hold mass demonstrations, calling for the Tunku to step down in favour of a leader who would restore [...] "Malay sovereignty". Sporadic rioting, believed to have been instigated by the Tunku's opponents, broke out. The Tunku responded by forcing Mahathir and Musa out of UMNO, while Ismail as Home Affairs Minister issued a statement: [...] "These ultras believe in the wild and fantastic theory of absolute dominion by one race over the other communities, regardless of the Constitution. ... Polarisation has taken place in Malaysian politics and the extreme racialists among the ruling party are making a desperate bid to topple the present leadership." ...|$|E
