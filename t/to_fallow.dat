And now the land is being deserted, the arable land is going back <b>to</b> <b>fallow.</b> Why? Why, says the driver, because {{the owners of the}} land won't spend any capital. They have got the capital locked up, and the land is dead. They find it cheaper to let all the arable go back <b>to</b> <b>fallow,</b> and raise a few head of cattle, rather than to pay high wages, grow corn, and get small returns.|$|E

Chemical fallow is examined {{as an alternative}} <b>to</b> tillage <b>fallow</b> for moisture and soil conservation.

50|$|The sandy soils in the {{semiarid}} areas {{south of}} the desert in northern Kurdufan and northern Darfur states support vegetation used for grazing.

Livestock raising is this area's major activity, but a significant amount of crop cultivation, mainly of pearl millet, also occurs. Peanuts and sesame are grown as cash crops. The qoz sands are the principal area from which gum arabic is obtained through tapping of Acacia senegal (known locally as hashab). This tree grows readily in the region, and cultivators occasionally plant hashab trees when land is returned <b>to</b> <b>fallow.</b>|$|E
50|$|The 1855 NYS census {{gives us}} an account on how the farm land was used. The farm was divided into plowed, fallow, pasture and meadow zones. The plowed land was further divided. Products {{produced}} from seed in 1854 included; winter wheat, oats, Barley, buckwheat, corn, and Irish potatoes. The orchard produced 150 bushels of apples, and 2 barrels of cider were made. The meadow produced 10 tons of hay plus a half bushel of grass seed was harvested. Additionally, 11 acres were allowed to sit fallow - were not used allowing weeds and grass to grow. This last point is interesting because six of the Schenckâ€™s immediate neighbors who were not of German or Pennsylvanian German heritage {{did not have any}} recorded land left <b>to</b> <b>fallow.</b>|$|E

25|$|Spring was {{the rainy}} season; farmers took {{advantage}} of this <b>to</b> bring <b>fallow</b> ground back into production. They practised biennial crop rotation, alternating from year <b>to</b> year between <b>fallow</b> and cultivated. Attempts to introduce triennial crop rotation with legumes in the third year, ran into problems due to the poor Greek soil, lack of power, and absence of mechanization. The Greeks did not use animal manure, possibly due to the low number of cattle. The only soil additive was weeds ploughed back into the ground after fields came out of fallow.|$|R
50|$|Crop {{rotations}} {{also affect}} {{the timing and}} length of when a field is subject <b>to</b> <b>fallow.</b> This is very important because depending on a particular region's climate, a field {{could be the most}} vulnerable to erosion when it is under fallow. Efficient fallow management {{is an essential part of}} reducing erosion in a crop rotation system. Zero tillage is a fundamental management practice that promotes crop stubble retention under longer unplanned fallows when crops cannot be planted. Such management practices that succeed in retaining suitable soil cover in areas under fallow will ultimately reduce soil loss. In a recent study that lasted a decade, it was found that a common winter cover crop after potato harvest such as fall rye can reduce soil run-off by as much as 43%, and this is typically the most nutritional soil.|$|E
5000|$|Their {{livelihood}} {{is based}} on slash-and-burn agriculture, although hunting with spears and dogs, fishing, and gathering wild roots and berries {{plays an important role}} in their economy. Bush meat is transported in a net, called kenken, from the forest to the house and markets. The Shabo live in small cleared plots in the middle of dense forests, which are being gradually deforested by the coffee agribusiness. Their small huts, made with pieces of wood and palm-leaves, stand in the middle of the cleared area, surrounded by haphazard cultivations of sorghum and corn. After six or seven years, the plot is left <b>to</b> <b>fallow</b> and a new plot is opened nearby. As among the Majangir, Shabo family units are well spaced out. There are no villages in the usual sense of the term. The Shabo have traditionally exchanged game, fish, skins and honey with the people of the Ethiopian Highlands.|$|E
50|$|Crop {{rotation}} in the soudanian zone traditionally {{begins with}} sorghum or millet {{in the first}} year. Mixed crops of sorghum and-or millet, with peanuts, legumes, or tubers, are then cultivated for approximately three years. Farmers then return the land <b>to</b> <b>fallow</b> for periods up to fifteen years, turning to different fields for the next cycle. Preparation of a field begins with cutting heavy bush and unwanted low trees or branches that are then laid on the ground. Collectively owned lands are parceled out during the dry season, and the fields are burned just {{before the onset of}} the first rains, usually around March. Farmers work most intensively during the rains between May and October, planting, weeding and protecting the crops from birds and animals. Harvesting begins in September and October with the early varieties of sorghum. The main harvest occurs in November and December. Farmers harvest crops of rice and berebere, the hardiest of Chad's varieties of millet, grown along receding water courses, as late as February.|$|E
50|$|While {{laboratory}} studies of certain antibiotics have been promising, {{there are no}} effective methods of eradication, so prevention is important. Oysters from populations or farms that have experienced disease should not be moved to areas without infestations, because the protist is easily introduced and transmitted. In aquaculture, there are efforts to locate and breed more resistant strains of oysters. Infested seed oysters should not be planted in oyster beds, and in disease-ridden areas the oysters should be removed and the site allowed <b>to</b> lie <b>fallow</b> <b>to</b> reduce the protist load.|$|R
