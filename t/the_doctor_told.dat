25|$|In early 1962, Mangeshkar {{was given}} slow poison. A doctor was called. He came with an x-ray machine to examine her, {{and gave her}} an {{injection}} to render her unconscious, because she was in pain. For three days, she had a close brush with death. After ten days, she began to recover. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> her that somebody had given her slow poison. The slow poison incident rendered her very weak. She was bedridden for nearly 3 months. The most surprising thing was that soon after the incident, the cook {{who used to work}} at Lataji's home, suddenly vanished without taking his wages. The cook had earlier worked with some Bollywood people. Bollywood lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri used to regularly visit Lataji at her home daily at 6 pm. Majrooh used to first taste the food and then allow Lata to eat. He used to recite poems and stories to keep Lata in good humour.|$|E

500|$|When {{looking into}} Rose's mind, Gwyneth is frightened and breaks off contact {{when she sees}} [...] "the things you've seen... the darkness... the Big Bad Wolf!" [...] The phrase [...] "bad wolf" [...] recurred {{in most of the}} stories in this season, {{culminating}} in the episode [...] "Bad Wolf" [...] and finally explained in [...] "The Parting of the Ways". The Doctor reacts visibly when the Gelth mention the Time War; the event had been alluded to in [...] "Rose" [...] and [...] "The End of the World", when <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>told</b> Rose that his people had been destroyed in a war. The Cardiff rift reappears in the episodes [...] "Boom Town" [...] and [...] "Utopia", and is a direct or indirect element in many of the alien encounters in the spin-off series Torchwood, set in Cardiff. The events of the episode are referenced in The Unicorn and the Wasp, when Donna compares the absurdity of the episode's events to [...] "meeting Charles Dickens, surrounded by ghosts, at Christmas", and [...] "The End of the World", when <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>told</b> Rose that his people had been destroyed in a war.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{anonymous}} eyewitness, {{women in the}} Marshalsea were in constant moral danger: [...] "How often has female virtue been assailed in poverty? Alas how often has it fallen, in consequence of a husband or a father having been a prisoner for debt?" [...] The prison doctor would visit every other day to attend to prisoners, and sometimes their children—to [...] "protect his reputation", according to a doctor testifying in 1815 to a parliamentary commission—but would not attend to their wives. This left women to give birth alone or {{with the help of}} other prisoners. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> the commission he had helped just once with a birth, and then only as a matter of courtesy, because it was not included in his salary.|$|E

2500|$|I {{was with}} her when she died. She left this world {{literally}} screaming {{at the top of her}} lungs. I {{was with her}} constantly, she lived not even 3 miles from my house, we were together practically every day.

Up until the last two days, she was still moving around. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> us she will leave very quickly and her body will just start to shut down. But when she left, she left the world with a bang, she left it how she lived it. She screamed her way out of here, literally. I truly believe her survival instincts were so part of her DNA that she was not going to go quietly or willingly. It was just the two of us hanging out [...] she was very funny. We didn't have to [...] because I always knew how she felt about me. I was the love of her life, so the last part of her life we didn't have to have these heart to heart talks.|$|E

2500|$|In this tent live Mrs B's five {{children}} (three quite grown up) {{and a little}} Kaffir servant girl. Many tents have more occupants. Mrs M. ...has six children in camp, all ill, two in the tin hospital with typhoid, and four sick in the tent. A terrible evil just now is the dew. It is so heavy, and comes through the single canvas of the tents, wetting everything… All the morning the gangways are filled with the blankets and odds and ends, regularly turned out to dry in the sun. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> me today he highly disapproved of tents for young children, and expected a high mortality before June.|$|E

And I'd say 'OK' – because I'm like that. They'd keep up the pressure so that I kept on writing. I was there in their offices working like that for six or eight weeks and when I flew home to Manchester I went straight round to see my doctor. I was feeling sick and could not eat. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> me: 'You are totally over-worked.'

2500|$|Madhubala's {{illness was}} known to Kishore, but like all the others, he did not realize its gravity; Ataullah Khan did not approve of his {{son-in-law}} at all, but he had lost the courage to disapprove. Ashok Kumar reminisced in a Filmfare interview: [...] "She suffered a lot and her illness made her very bad-tempered. She often fought with Kishore, and would take off to her father's house where she {{spent most of her}} time." [...] Madhubala's sister echoes this view albeit in a slightly different tone: [...] "After marriage they flew to London where <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> her she had only two years to live. After that Kishore left her at our house saying: 'I can't look after her. I'm on outdoors often'. But she wanted to be with him. He’d visit her once in two months, though. Maybe he wanted to detach himself from her so that the final separation wouldn't hurt. But he never abused her as was reported. He bore her medical expenses. They remained married for nine years.|$|E

50|$|On Monday December 24, 1974 <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>told</b> al-Atrash {{that after}} two days he could go home.

2500|$|In November 1948, a tiny {{cancerous}} lump {{was found}} on Ramana's arm and was removed in February 1949 by the ashram's doctor. Soon, another growth appeared, and another operation was performed by an eminent surgeon in March 1949 with radium applied. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>told</b> Ramana that a complete amputation of the arm to the shoulder was required to save his life, but he refused. A third and fourth operation were performed in August and December 1949, but only weakened him. Other systems of medicine were then tried; all proved fruitless and were stopped {{by the end of}} March when devotees gave up all hope. To devotees who begged him to cure himself {{for the sake of his}} followers, Ramana is said to have replied, [...] "Why are you so attached to this body? Let it go," [...] and [...] "Where can I go? I am here." [...] By April 1950, Ramana was too weak to go to the hall and visiting hours were limited. Visitors would file past the small room where he spent his last days to get one final glimpse. He died on 14 April 1950 at 8:47p.m. At the same time a shooting star was seen, which impressed some of his devotees as a synchronicity.|$|E
