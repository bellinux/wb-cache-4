30|$|The ERTMS was {{introduced}} {{as a standard}} in order to replace and harmonize national railway control and signalling systems, which vary greatly {{from country to country}} [25]. There are three ETCS levels. Level 1 represents track to train communication, provided by Eurobalises located along tracks that interface with the existing signalling system and line side signals. Level 2 is an enhancement of Level 1 with movement authority from Radio Block Centre (RBC) through interlocking to on-board ECTS via GSM-R link, which enables the elimination of trackside signals. Level 2 covers <b>track-to-train</b> <b>communication</b> and vice versa. On this level, RBC calculates the correct movement authority, giving authorization to proceed (or not), with balises used to transmit static messages such as location, line profile, and speed limit. Further, Level 3 improves the ability of Level 2 so that train detection by the trackside is no longer required. At this level, the RBC uses GSM-R for transmission between track and train. Compared with Level 1 and 2 which are based on a fixed block signalling system, Level 3 allows a moving block signalling system; this means that as the train travels, the track receives the train location and train integrity from the train. Levels 1 and 2 are already widely applied in Europe, while Level 3 is currently under development [11, 110]. The ERTMS has been adopted in countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Algeria, Argentina, and New Zealand.|$|E
