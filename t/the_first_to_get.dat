5|$|General Matsui, {{along with}} the Army General Staff, envisaged making a slow and steady march on Nanking, but his {{subordinates}} refused to play along and instead raced eagerly {{with each other to}} be <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the city. Soon all units were roaring to Nanking at the breakneck pace of up to forty kilometers (25 miles) per day. For instance, the 10th Army captured the key town of Guangde on November 30 three days before it was even supposed to start its planned advance, and the SEA captured Danyang on December 2 more than five days ahead of schedule. In order to achieve such speeds, the Japanese soldiers carried little with them except weaponry and ammunition. Because they were marching well ahead of most of their supply lines they had to purchase or loot their food from Chinese civilians along the way.|$|E
5|$|The group quickly {{separated}} {{on the run}} leg and {{the lead}} group was down to eight athletes after one lap of the running course. They were Spirig, Nordén, Densham, Jenkins, Groff and Hewitt, Ainhoa Murúa (Spain) and Emma Jackson (Australia). Jackson was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> dropped and was followed by Groff and Murúa. The five remaining athletes finished the second run lap together. The group was then reduced to four when Hewitt was dropped. The American Groff then rejoined the group at the very start of the final run lap after been dropped earlier on in the race. With 500 metres in the final lap to race Jenkins was dropped by the other four athletes. In the ensuing sprint finish between Spirig, Nordén, Densham and Groff, Spirig pushed the pace and held off a fast-finishing Nordén to win by an estimated margin of 15 centimetres. Both athletes recorded a time one hour, 59 minutes and 48 seconds, and were separated by a photo finish. Densham finished two seconds behind Spirig to win bronze. Groff finished fourth with Jenkins fifth, Hewitt sixth, Murúa seventh and Jackson eighth.|$|E

5|$|The women's triathlon {{took place}} on 4 August 2012, {{featuring}} 55 women from 31 countries. Lucy Hall (Great Britain), the youngest athlete in the race, led early in the swim and finished the swim leg first {{in a time of}} 18 minutes and 27 seconds. Hall led a group of seven; Line Jensen (Denmark), Mariko Adachi (Japan), Pâmella Oliveira (Brazil), Claudia Rivas (Mexico), Laura Bennett (United States) and Jessica Harrison (France); out of the water. In {{the early stages of the}} bike leg, Hall slowed the leading pack down so that her teammate Helen Jenkins (Great Britain) could catch-up. The lead pack joined with the peloton at the end of the second cycling lap to form a 22-women strong group. Despite the chase group chasing hard, all 22 athletes finished the cycling leg in the same pack without any additions. There was a time difference of one minute and 44 seconds between the 22nd and 23rd athletes after the bike leg. Due to overnight rain the roads were wet and multiple athletes crashed on the bike leg. Two athletes in Kathy Tremblay (Canada) and Emma Moffatt (Australia) had to withdraw from the race due to crashing. Moffatt, one of the pre-race favourites crashed on the first lap of the cycling leg. The lead group quickly separated on the run leg and the lead group was down to eight athletes after one lap of the running course. They were Nicola Spirig (Switzerland), Lisa Nordén (Sweden), Erin Densham (Australia), Jenkins, Sarah Groff (United States) and Andrea Hewitt (New Zealand), Ainhoa Murúa (Spain) and Emma Jackson (Australia). Jackson was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> dropped and was followed by Groff and Murúa. The five remaining athletes finished the second run lap together.

Groff finished fourth with Jenkins fifth, Hewitt sixth, Murúa seventh and Jackson eighth. After the race, Nordén and the Swedish Olympic Committee appealed against the result in the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The organisation turned down the appeal and Spirig retained the gold medal.|$|E

They reached 100 stores in August 2009 and, as of December 2009, the retail chain had acquired and reopened 52 former Woolworths stores.

25|$|Warne is {{also noted}} for his exuberant (and {{sometimes}} effective) lower-order batting, once famously being dismissed for 99 with a reckless shot {{on what was}} later {{shown to be a}} no ball. In fact, of all Test cricketers Warne has scored the most Test runs without having scored a century, with two scores in the nineties being his best efforts (99 and 91). Warne is also third overall in the most international test ducks. Of players who have batted in more than 175 Test innings, his proportion of dismissals by being out bowled is the lowest, at under seven percent. In 2006 Warne and Glenn McGrath reportedly lost a bet of which bowler would be <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a Test century with fellow Australian bowler Jason Gillespie after Gillespie scored a record double-century as a nightwatchman against Bangladesh.|$|E

25|$|Player {{and team}} {{strategy}} {{varies depending on}} the size and layout of the field and the total number and experience level of players. The most basic strategy is to coordinate with the team to distribute the team members across the field roughly perpendicular to the line between starting stations to cover all potential lines of advance; a team that runs all in the same direction is easily flanked by opponents moving around the field on the opposite side. A second basic goal is to control as much of the field as possible, as early as possible, either by being <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to advantageous obstacles on the field or by quickly eliminating one or more opponents {{to reduce the number of}} directions each player has to watch for incoming paint. The more territory that the members of a team have behind them, the more options they have for choosing effective cover and changing position to get a good shot at one or more opponents, and because the field is of finite size, the fewer options the opposing team has.|$|E

This installment was described by GameSpy as a hard overhaul of F-Zero and featured improvements to its graphical effects. F-Zero GX and AX, were released for the Nintendo GameCube and the Triforce arcade system board respectively in 2003, was the first significant video game collaboration between Nintendo and Sega. GX is the first F-Zero game to include a story mode, while AX was called by GameSpot as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a [...] "proper arcade release".

500|$|Similar to Kameny's regret {{at his own}} {{reaction}} to the shift in attitudes after the riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as [...] "one of the greatest mistakes of his life". The image of gays retaliating against police, {{after so many years}} of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, [...] "stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals". Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, [...] "Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement... Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement. Certainly it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale." [...] David Carter, in his article [...] "What made Stonewall different", explained that even though there were several uprisings before Stonewall, the reason Stonewall was so historical was that thousands of people were involved, the riot lasted a long time (six days), it was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> major media coverage, and it sparked the formation of many gay rights groups.|$|E
500|$|After graduating, Hoffman {{worked in}} off-Broadway theater and made {{additional}} money with customer service jobs. He made his screen debut in 1991, in a Law & Order episode called [...] "The Violence of Summer", playing a {{man accused of}} rape. His first cinema role came the following year, when he was credited as [...] "Phil Hoffman" [...] in the independent film Triple Bogey on a Par Five Hole. After this, he adopted his grandfather's name, Seymour, to avoid confusion with another actor. More film roles promptly followed, with appearances in the studio production My New Gun, and a small role in the comedy Leap of Faith, starring Steve Martin. Following these roles, he gained attention playing a spoiled student in the Oscar-winning Al Pacino film Scent of a Woman (1992). Hoffman auditioned five times for his role, which The Guardian journalist Ryan Gilbey says gave him an early opportunity [...] "to indulge his skill for making unctuousness compelling". The film earned US$134 million worldwide and was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Hoffman noticed. Reflecting on Scent of a Woman, Hoffman later said [...] "If I hadn't gotten into that film, I wouldn't be where I am today." [...] At this time, he abandoned his job in a delicatessen to become a professional actor.|$|E
