25|$|Parasympathetic {{stimulation}} originates {{from the}} cardioinhibitory region with impulses traveling via the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X). The vagus nerve sends branches {{to both the}} SA and AV nodes, and to portions of both the atria and ventricles. Parasympathetic stimulation releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction. ACh slows HR by opening chemical- or ligand-gated potassium ion channels to slow the rate of spontaneous depolarization, which extends repolarization and increases the time before the next spontaneous depolarization occurs. Without any nervous stimulation, the SA node would establish a sinus rhythm of approximately 100 bpm. Since resting rates are considerably less than <b>this,</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> evident that parasympathetic stimulation normally slows HR. This is similar to an individual driving a car with {{one foot on the}} brake pedal. To speed up, one need merely remove one’s foot from the brake and let the engine increase speed. In the case of the heart, decreasing parasympathetic stimulation decreases the release of ACh, which allows HR to increase up to approximately 100 bpm. Any increases beyond this rate would require sympathetic stimulation.|$|E

60|$|Without enlarging, however, {{on these}} and many minor facts, we venture {{to think that}} the {{evidence}} already assigned is sufficient to justify our position. Had the proofs been few or of one kind, little faith could have been placed in the inference. But numerous as they are, alike in the case of titles, in that of complimentary phrases, and in that of salutes--similar and simultaneous, too, as the process of depreciation has been in all of these; the evidences become strong by mutual confirmation. And when we recollect, also, that not only have the results of this process been visible in various nations and in all times, but that they are occurring among ourselves at the present moment, and that the causes assigned for previous depreciations may be seen daily working out other ones--when we recollect <b>this,</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> scarcely possible to doubt that the process has been as alleged; and that our ordinary words, acts, and phrases of civility were originally acknowledgments of submission to another's omnipotence.|$|E
60|$|The next {{property}} constantly observable in {{such objects}} is smoothness;[24] a quality so essential to beauty, that I do not now recollect anything beautiful {{that is not}} smooth. In trees and flowers, smooth leaves are beautiful; smooth slopes of earth in gardens; smooth streams in the landscape; smooth coats of birds and beasts in animal beauties; in fine women, smooth skins; and in several sorts of ornamental furniture, smooth and polished surfaces. A very considerable part {{of the effect of}} beauty is owing to this quality; indeed the most considerable. For, take any beautiful object, and give it a broken, and rugged surface; and, however well formed it may be in other respects, it pleases no longer. Whereas, let it want ever so many of the other constituents, if it wants not <b>this,</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> more pleasing than almost all the others without it. This seems to me so evident, that I am a good deal surprised that none who have handled the subject have made any mention of the quality of smoothness in the enumeration of those that go to the forming of beauty. For, indeed, any ruggedness, any sudden, projection, any sharp angle, is in the highest degree contrary to that idea.|$|E

6000|$|If {{these views}} are correct, why may not an English writer secure a {{right in this}} country, by selling it in season, to a citizen here? An {{equitable}} trust might not, probably would not be sufficient; but a bona fide transfer for a valuable consideration, I begin to think, would. It {{seems to me that}} all the misconception which has existed on this point has arisen from supposing that the term publication refers to other than a publication in the country. But, when one remembers how rare it is to get lawyers to agree on a question like <b>this,</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> a layman to advance his opinion with great humility. I suppose, after all a good way of getting an accurate notion of the meaning of the law, would be to toss a dollar into the air, and cry [...] "heads," [...] or [...] "tails." [...] Sir Walter Scott seemed fully aware of the great circulation of his books in America, as well as how much he lost by not being able to secure a copyright.

6000|$|Relationships are all due to {{the joint}} action of two groups of {{variable}} causes, the one common to both of the related objects, the other special to each, {{as in the case}} just discussed. Using an analogous nomenclature to that already employed, the peculiarity of one of the two objects is due to an aggregate of variable causes that we may call C+X, and that of the other to C+Z, in which C are the causes common to both, and X and Z the special ones. In exact proportion as X and Z diminish, and C becomes of overpowering effect, so does the closeness of the relationship increase. When X and Z both disappear, the result is identity of character. On the other hand, when C disappears, all relationship ceases, and the variations of the two objects are strictly independent. The simplest case is that in which X and Z are equal, and in <b>this,</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> easy to devise a scale in which 0° shall stand for no relationship, and 100° for identity, and upon which the intermediate degrees of relationship may be marked at their proper value. Upon this assumption, but with some misgiving, I will attempt to subject the digits to this form of measurement. It will save time first to work out an example, and then, after gaining in that way, a clearer understanding of what the process is, to discuss its defects. Let us select for our example the case that brings out these defects in the most conspicuous manner, as follows:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{hypothesis}} once entertained, is seen {{to harmonise}} with all primitive ideas and practices. The sons of the deified chief reigning after him, it necessarily happens that all early kings are held descendants of the gods; {{and the fact that}} alike in Assyria, Egypt, among the Jews, Phoenicians, and ancient Britons, kings' names were formed out of the names of the gods, is fully explained. The genesis of Polytheism out of Fetishism, by the successive migrations of the race of god-kings to the other world--a genesis illustrated in the Greek mythology, alike by the precise genealogy of the deities, and by the specifically asserted apotheosis of the later ones--tends further to bear it out. It explains {{the fact that in the}} old creeds, as in the still extant creed of the Otaheitans, every family has its guardian spirit, who is supposed to be one of their departed relatives; and that they sacrifice to these as minor gods--a practice still pursued by the Chinese and even by the Russians. It is perfectly congruous with the Grecian myths concerning the wars of the Gods with the Titans and their final usurpation; and it similarly agrees with the fact that among the Teutonic gods proper was one Freir who came among them by adoption, [...] "but was born among the Vanes, a somewhat mysterious other dynasty of gods, who had been conquered and superseded by the stronger and more warlike Odin dynasty." [...] It harmonises, too, with the belief that there are different gods to different territories and nations, as there were different chiefs; that these gods contend for supremacy as chiefs do; and it gives meaning to the boast of neighbouring tribes--"Our god is greater than your god." [...] It is confirmed by the notion universally current in early times, that the gods come from this other abode, in which they commonly live, and appear among men--speak to them, help them, punish them. And remembering <b>this,</b> <b>it</b> <b>becomes</b> manifest that the prayers put up by primitive peoples to their gods for aid in battle, are meant literally--that their gods are expected to come back from the other kingdom they are reigning over, and once more fight the old enemies they had before warred against so implacably; and it needs but to name the Iliad, to remind every one how thoroughly they believed the expectation fulfilled.|$|E
