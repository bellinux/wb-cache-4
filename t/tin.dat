5|$|Owing to the ageing of buildings, the {{reconstruction}} of Lam <b>Tin</b> Estate was announced in September 1995 {{as part of an}} urban renewal project. Demolition started in 1997 and was completed in 2002. After reconstruction, Lam <b>Tin</b> Estate became Kai <b>Tin</b> Estate, Tak <b>Tin</b> Estate, Ping <b>Tin</b> Estate and Hong Yat Court.|$|E
5|$|The colonial {{government}} built Lam <b>Tin</b> Estate in the 1960s to settle low-income residents during {{the influx of}} population from mainland China after the Korean War. Gradually, Lam <b>Tin</b> became a common term to Hongkongers describing the areas around Lam <b>Tin</b> Estate. The dragon emblem painted on Block 15 of Lam <b>Tin</b> Estate {{was a symbol of}} Lam Tin's unity until the building's demolition in 1998. The land of Lam <b>Tin</b> Estate was absorbed into Ping <b>Tin</b> Estate, Kai <b>Tin</b> Estate, Tak <b>Tin</b> Estate and Kwong <b>Tin</b> Estate.|$|E
5000|$|Snorkers is the {{nickname}} for Palethorpe's pre-cooked <b>tinned</b> sausages. The nickname originated aboard World War II Royal Navy submarines, {{along with other}} culinary delights such as HITS (<b>tinned</b> Herrings In Tomato Sauce) and Baby's Heads (<b>tinned</b> steak and kidney pudding). Fresh food lasted {{only a few days}} aboard submarines so nearly everything was <b>tinned.</b>|$|R
50|$|Early {{hot rolling}} strip mills {{did not produce}} strip {{suitable}} for <b>tinning,</b> but in 1929 cold rolling began {{to be used to}} reduce the gauge further, which made <b>tinning</b> achievable. The plate was then <b>tinned</b> using the process outlined above.|$|R

5|$|The entire Lam <b>Tin</b> area {{is served}} by both tap water and {{flushing}} sea water supplies. The tap water is piped either from surface water or Dongjiang River into two service reservoirs and then pumped to individual households. The two service reservoirs that serve Lam <b>Tin</b> are Lam <b>Tin</b> Low Level Fresh Water Service Reservoir and Lam <b>Tin</b> High Level Service Reservoir. Built together with Lam <b>Tin</b> Estate, the low level reservoir {{is covered with a}} concrete-surfaced football field. The reservoir is now located between Kai <b>Tin</b> Estate and Tak <b>Tin</b> Estate. The high level reservoir, on the other hand, is farther away from residential estates. It is located near Lam <b>Tin</b> Park, on the slope of Black Hill.|$|E
5|$|The first bus {{terminus}} {{built in}} Lam <b>Tin</b> {{was then called}} Lam <b>Tin</b> Bus Terminus, which is today's Tak <b>Tin</b> Bus Terminus. It is built on the slope of Lam <b>Tin</b> Hill, in the north part of Lam <b>Tin</b> Estate, to serve the neighbourhood's residents. Buses ran from Kwun Tong to the bus terminus through Lei Yue Mun Road, then turned left and ascended the hill along Kai <b>Tin</b> Road, Ping <b>Tin</b> Street, On <b>Tin</b> Street and Tak <b>Tin</b> Street.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} housing estate in Lam <b>Tin</b> was Lam <b>Tin</b> Estate. The estate {{was built in}} the 1960s and the 1970s to settle the influx of {{mainland}} immigrants. The late 1980s saw the district's first private residential buildings. Various facilities built during the 1990s made Lam <b>Tin</b> a compact residential area, however Lam <b>Tin</b> Estate was demolished in the 1990s and was redeveloped into Ping <b>Tin</b> Estate, Tak <b>Tin</b> Estate and Kai <b>Tin</b> Estate.|$|E

50|$|Tadley treacle mines had a local hotel {{named after}} {{them and a}} Tadley Treacle Fair is held. Legend says the name derives from using treacle <b>tins</b> to store money because banks could not be trusted. The <b>tins</b> were buried around the village. Criminals mined for <b>tins.</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Several {{pieces of}} {{evidence}} indicate that tumor-infiltrating neutrophils (<b>TINs)</b> are correlated to tumor progression. In the current study, we explore the relationship between <b>TINs</b> and clinicopathological features of gastric adenocarcinoma patients. Furthermore, we investigated the prognostic value of <b>TINs.</b> Patients and Methods: The study was comprised of two groups, training group (115 patients) and test group (97 patients). Biomarkers (intratumoral CD 15 + neutrophils) were assessed by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between clinicopathological features and patient outcome were evaluated using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: Immunohistochemical detection showed that the tumor-infiltrating neutrophils (<b>TINs)</b> in the training group ranged from 0. 00 – 115. 70 cells/high-power microscopic field (HPF) and the median number was 21. 60 cells/HPF. Based on the median number, the patients were divided into high and low <b>TINs</b> groups. Chi-square test analysis revealed that the density of CD 15 + <b>TINs</b> was positively associated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0. 024), distance metastasis (p = 0. 004) and UICC (International Union Against Cancer) staging (p = 0. 028). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with a lower density of <b>TINs</b> had a better prognosis than patients with a higher density of <b>TINs</b> (p = 0. 002). Multivariate Cox’s analysis showed that the density of CD 15 + <b>TINs</b> was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival of gastric adenocarcinoma patients. Using another 97 patients as a test group and basing on the median number of <b>TINs</b> (21. 60 cells/HPF) coming from th...|$|R
5|$|Being {{a compact}} {{residential}} area, Lam <b>Tin</b> has various facilities to satisfy its residents' daily needs. These include shopping malls, recreational facilities, water and other supplies. Furthermore, during the 1970s and 1980s, Lam <b>Tin</b> hosted landfills.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{recreation}} grounds, Lam <b>Tin</b> also hosts Stage 3 of Wilson Trail. The section {{starts at}} Exit A of Lam <b>Tin</b> MTR Station, runs east along Kai <b>Tin</b> Road and Lei Yue Mun Road, up Black Hill {{along the road}} towards Junk Bay Chinese Permanent Cemetery, west along the Black Hill, and finally leaves Lam <b>Tin</b> near Ma Yau Tong towards the section's terminus at Tseng Lan Shue.|$|E
5|$|Between 1989 and 1994, Lam <b>Tin</b> MTR Station, Laguna City and Pik Wan Road were built. To serve these newly {{populated}} areas, {{three new}} bus termini were constructed: Lam <b>Tin</b> MTR Bus Terminus, now commonly named Lam <b>Tin</b> Bus Terminus as {{shown on the}} wall painting of the terminus; Laguna City Bus Terminus, which took up routes originally terminating at Kwun Tong Ferry; and Kwong <b>Tin</b> Bus Terminus, with new routes initiated to serve exclusively Lam <b>Tin</b> and the area nearby.|$|E
5000|$|The First World War saw a {{break in}} the supply of {{decorated}} biscuit <b>tins.</b> Many manufacturers hesitated to resume production of [...] "fancy" [...] <b>tins</b> once the restrictions had been lifted.

5|$|In 1990 Tseung Kwan O Tunnel {{was built}} with its {{southern}} entrance in Lam <b>Tin,</b> adding a convenient and direct route to Tseung Kwan O. Junk Bay Chinese Permanent Cemetery {{was built in}} the same year. Despite being located in Tseung Kwan O, the cemetery's only motor-enabled exit is located in Lam <b>Tin.</b> As a result, Lam <b>Tin</b> becomes crowded with people tending graves during the various festivals.|$|E
5|$|In common speech, {{the name}} Lam <b>Tin</b> {{in the past}} usually {{included}} the areas of Lei Yue Mun and Yau Tong. However, new infrastructure and housing estates that were built there are not now considered part of Lam <b>Tin.</b> Conventional boundaries of Lam Tin: west to Laguna City, southeast to Kwong <b>Tin</b> Estate, north {{to the entrance of}} Tseung Kwan O Tunnel, southwest to Victoria Harbour.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, John Dalton used {{the concept of}} atoms to explain why {{elements}} always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the law of multiple proportions). For instance, {{there are two types}} of <b>tin</b> oxide: one is 88.1% <b>tin</b> and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% <b>tin</b> and 21.3% oxygen (tin(II) oxide and <b>tin</b> dioxide respectively). This means that 100g of <b>tin</b> will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units—in other words, atoms. In the case of <b>tin</b> oxides, one <b>tin</b> atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tins</b> {{shaped like}} actual objects {{began to be}} made in the late 1890s. The earlier <b>tins</b> were shaped like baskets but {{gradually}} a whole range of fine art objects appeared.
