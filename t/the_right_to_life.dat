5|$|Article 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, {{specifically}} Article 9(1), guarantees <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> and {{the right}} to personal liberty. The Court of Appeal has called <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> the most basic of human rights, but has yet to fully define the term in the Constitution. Contrary to the broad position taken in jurisdictions such as Malaysia and the United States, the High Court of Singapore has said that personal liberty only refers to freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{difficult}} questions involving <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> is when exactly life begins and ends. If an unborn child is treated as a living person, then it should be accorded <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> under the Constitution. Laws permitting abortion would thus be unconstitutional. This issue has yet to come before the Singapore courts.|$|E
5|$|Human {{rights in}} Turkey {{have been the}} subject of some {{controversy}} and international condemnation. Between 1998 and 2008 the European Court of Human Rights made more than 1,600 judgements against Turkey for human rights violations, particularly regarding <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>life,</b> and freedom from torture. Other issues, such as Kurdish rights, women's rights, LGBT rights, and press freedom, have also attracted controversy. Turkey's human rights record continues to be a significant obstacle to future membership of the EU.|$|E

5|$|The {{constitution}} also imposes {{restrictions on}} these rights. The government restricts these freedoms {{in the interest}} of the independence, sovereignty and integrity of India. In the interest of morality and public order, the government can also impose restrictions. However, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> and personal liberty cannot be suspended. The six freedoms are also automatically suspended or have restrictions imposed on them during a state of emergency.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore, the Penal Code {{lays out}} {{sanctions}} for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, which limits abortion {{to women who}} have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. By not conferring <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect {{the life of the mother}} and the life of the unborn from conception. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.|$|E
5|$|Rights of {{a person}} arrested under {{ordinary}} circumstances is laid down in <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> and personal liberty. No one can be arrested without being told the grounds for his arrest. If arrested, the person {{has the right to}} defend himself by a lawyer of his choice. Also an arrested citizen has to be brought before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours. The rights {{of a person}} arrested under ordinary circumstances are not available to an enemy alien. They are also not available to persons detained under the Preventive Detention Act. Under preventive detention, the government can imprison a person for a maximum of three months. It means that if the government feels that a person being at liberty can be a threat to the law and order or to the unity and integrity of the nation, it can detain or arrest that person to prevent him from doing this possible harm. After three months such a case is brought before an advisory board for review.|$|E

They emphasise on the fundamental unity of India by guaranteeing to all citizens the access {{and use of the}} same facilities, irrespective of background. Some {{fundamental rights}} apply for persons of any nationality whereas others are available only to the citizens of India. <b>The</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>life</b> and personal liberty is available to all people and so is the right to freedom of religion. On the other hand, freedoms of speech and expression and freedom to reside and settle in any part of the country are reserved to citizens alone, including non-resident Indian citizens. The right to equality in matters of public employment cannot be conferred to overseas citizens of India.|$|E
