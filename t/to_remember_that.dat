5|$|Anne Whittle (Chattox) {{was accused}} {{of the murder of}} Robert Nutter. She pleaded not guilty, but the {{confession}} she had made to Roger Nowell was read out in court, and evidence against her was presented by James Robinson, who had lived with the Chattox family 20 years earlier. He claimed <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> Nutter had accused Chattox of turning his beer sour, and that she was commonly believed to be a witch. Chattox broke down and admitted her guilt, calling on God for forgiveness and the judges to be merciful to her daughter, Anne Redferne.|$|E

25|$|A vacancy {{opened in}} September 1859, and Buchanan {{personally}} delivered the appointment to Montgomery Meigs. Meigs thanked Floyd in a letter. He gave {{a copy of}} it to John, telling him to save it and <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> John B. Floyd was his patron.|$|E
25|$|Domestic abuse can be {{broadly defined}} as {{any form of}} abusive {{behaviours}} by one or both partners in an intimate relationship, such as marriage, cohabitation, family, dating, or even friends. It is important <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> abuse is always intentional, and can not happen by accident.|$|E

25|$|Although {{it helps}} focus managers' {{attention}} on strategic {{issues and the}} management of the implementation of strategy, it is important <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> the balanced scorecard itself has no role in the formation of strategy. In fact, balanced scorecards can co-exist with strategic planning systems and other tools.|$|E
25|$|If wound pain is not {{assessed}} {{and documented}} {{it may be}} ignored and/or not addressed properly. It is important <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> increased wound pain may be an indicator of wound complications that need treatment, and therefore practitioners must constantly reassess the wound {{as well as the}} associated pain.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} {{of two or more}} incomes, allow for households to increase their income substantially without moving higher on the occupational ladder or attaining higher educational degrees. Thus it is important <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> the favorable economic position of households in the top two quintiles is in some cases the result of combined income, rather than demand for a single worker.|$|E

25|$|On many lines, the new {{units were}} warmly welcomed. It is {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> {{while the first}} generation DMUs had given many years of service, in very many cases, they suffered from lack of and/or poor maintenance, with sometimes filthy and worn interiors, and leaking exhaust systems. Ignoring arguments over comfort and style, {{the mere fact that}} the trains were clean and new was enough to make them welcome countrywide.|$|E
25|$|Considering the biomechanical {{force system}} {{generated}} by a cantilever, it is important <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> {{a combination of a}} moment and a force is produced at the unit into which the cantilever is inserted, whereas only a single force is developed with respect to the point of force application of the other end. The magnitude of the two forces is equal and opposite, according to the third law of Newton, and the activation can be measured by a dynamometer.|$|E
25|$|This rescued work {{contains}} a great wealth of material, {{in which one}} follows {{in the footsteps of}} a master historian. Yet, perhaps because of its nature as reconstructed student lecture notes, it more often lacks the fine points of literary composition and style, and of course the narrative drive of the original three volumes. Nonetheless it is well <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> the students involved here in taking the lecture notes were themselves quite accomplished people, and one listener and recorder was already a mature father.|$|E

In 2014 he added six books to the total, including his prison journal. Sales have been brisk. The books have received highly favorable reviews from readers, {{most of whom are}} too young <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> Irving was the author of the Hughes Hoax. Irving has been open about it, and offers the text of the hoax autobiography for sale in book form. In May 2014 Irving launched his official website, cliffordirving.com.|$|E
25|$|Social classes feature {{their own}} sub-cultures and have {{therefore}} developed slightly different manners of socializing their offspring. Due to class mobility individuals may also acculturate {{to the culture}} of another class when ascending or descending in the social order. However, one does need <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> all social classes in the United States, except the upper class, consist of tens of millions of people. Thus social classes form social groups so large that they feature considerable diversity within and any statement regarding a given social class' culture needs {{to be seen as a}} broad generalization.|$|E
25|$|Heat {{generated}} by fission products would initially be at about 7% of full reactor power, which requires significant cooling. The CANDU designs have several emergency cooling systems, {{as well as}} having limited self-pumping capability through thermal means (the steam generator is well above the reactor). Even {{in the event of}} a catastrophic accident and core meltdown, it is important <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> the fuel is not critical in light water. This means that cooling the core with water from nearby sources will not add to the reactivity of the fuel mass.|$|E

25|$|It is good <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> {{all these}} {{documents}} {{were written by}} humans, who used human judgment as to whether to note something. For example, once in Europe, German air raids and picking up dead bodies from the sea were fairly common occurrences. At some point, they became too common to report. The Deck Log might mention an air raid on one day but the War Diary might make no mention of it. A week later, the opposite might be true. The clearest picture comes from reading all the documents.|$|E
25|$|In 1628, {{during the}} {{political}} turmoil {{that culminated in}} his assassination, Buckingham commissioned another masque-like painting from Gerrit van Honthorst, The Liberal Arts presented to King Charles and Henrietta Maria. In this the Duke is cast as Mercury, the patron of the arts, the procession of whom is brought in his train {{to the presence of}} the king and queen in the guise of Apollo and Diana. In this validation of his artistic credentials, it is appropriate <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> Buckingham had taken part in the masque Mercury Vindicated at the start of his career in 1615.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> unlike, for example, Roman roads, these medieval routes were not essentially physical entitiesâ€”thin strips of land with physical boundaries; rather they were rights of way, sometimes with legal and traditional status. Routes tended {{to follow the}} line of least resistance, twisting and turning to avoid poorly drained areas and land that was easily overlooked. Where there was a hill to climb or a difficult area to pass through, multiple tracks would develop, the traveller taking the easiest route. Routes may also have varied seasonally as changing weather affected {{the condition of the}} pathway.|$|E
