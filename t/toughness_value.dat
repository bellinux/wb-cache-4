From the above discussion, {{it is clear that}} an accurate determination of the plane-strain fracture toughness requires a specimen whose thickness exceeds some critical thickness (B). Testing has shown that plane-strain conditions generally prevail when:When a material of unknown fracture toughness is tested, a specimen of full material section thickness is tested or the specimen is sized based on a prediction of the fracture toughness. If the fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>value</b> resulting from the test does not satisfy the requirement of the above equation, the test must be repeated using a thicker specimen.

50|$|Generally, {{materials}} display {{either a}} flat R curve or a rising R curve. For a flat R curve, material resistance is constant {{with respect to}} crack extension. When the resistance curve is flat, it exhibits a critical value of energy release rate Gc. A material with a rising R curve, however, cannot be uniquely characterized with a single <b>toughness</b> <b>value.</b> A flawed structure fails when the driving force curve is tangent to the R curve, but this point of tangency depends on {{the shape of the}} driving force curve, which depends on the configuration of the structure. Materials with rising R curves are generally characterized by the value of G at the beginning of crack growth, but the precise moment of initiation is unclear. The R curve for an ideally brittle material is flat because the surface energy is a fixed property. Nonlinear behavior, like ductile fracture, can result in a rising R curve as the plastic zone at crack tip increases in size with extension. Falling R curves occur when a metal fails by cleavage. Cleavage propagation is unstable and very high strain rates are found near the crack tip. This suppresses plastic deformation.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to compare torsional strength, distortion angle, and toughness of various nickel-titanium (NiTi) rotary files. Methods: Five NiTi rotary instruments with different cross-sectional geometries were selected: TF and RaCe with equilateral triangle, ProTaper with convex-triangle, ProFile with U-shape, and Mtwo with S-shape. The size 25 /. 06 taper of TF, RaCe, ProFile, and Mtwo and the ProTaper F 1 files were tested, all with the same diameter at D 5. A metal mounting block with a cubical hole was constructed in which 5 mm of the file tip was rigidly held in place by filling the mold with a resin composite. The files were subjected to clockwise rotation at 2 rpm in a torsion tester. The torque and angular distortion were monitored until the file failed. The data were compared statistically for the yield and ultimate strengths, plastic hardening period, and toughness. Results: TF and RaCe had significantly lower yield strength than other systems. TF had a significantly lower ultimate strength than other files, whereas Mtwo showed the greatest. ProFile showed the highest distortion angle at break, followed by TF. ProFile also showed the highest <b>toughness</b> <b>value,</b> whereas TF and RaCe both showed a lower <b>toughness</b> <b>value</b> than the others (P <. 05). Fractographic examination revealed typical pattern of torsional fracture for all brands, characterized by circular abrasion marks and skewed dimples near the center of rotation. Conclusions: Under the limitations of the present study, the 5 tested NiTi rotary files showed a similar mechanical behavior under torsional load, with a period of plastic deformation before actual torsional breakage but with unequal strength and <b>toughness</b> <b>value.</b> Copyright © 2011 American Association of Endodontists. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Not only {{intergranular}} (IG) crack {{but also}} quasi-cleavage (QC) crack {{play a vital}} role in the hydrogen assisted fracture process of Q/T ASTM A 490 steels. Fractographic analysis of the fracture surface of the specimen revealed that at the beginning of a fracture process a QC crack was developed at the site of a micro-defect, such as a non-metallic inclusion inherent in the engineering materials, and grew to critical size, triggering the fatal unstable growth of an IG crack, involving a change of the propagation mode from QC to IG cracking. A particular fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>value</b> associated with hydrogen degradation can be obtained from the event of unstable growth of an IG crack during the fracture test. This fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>value,</b> KIH, can be explained as the critical condition for the onset of unstable growth of an IG crack or crack growth resistance of the hydrogen-damaged grain boundary. The generality of the statement was confirmed by further experiments employing a specially prepared unnotched specimen, having a fatigue precrack that triggered the onset of IG crack growth in the same manner as the QC crack. Furthermore, the discussion is extended to the essential nature of the hydrogen assisted fracture process by comparing the cracking behaviour in notched and unnotched specimens...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Fracture {{toughness}} {{of material}} {{has a great}} importance in {{the determination of the}} resistance of the material to crack propagation. The starting point in fracture mechanics analysis is to consider a crack of a certain size located in a component or specimen. The pure tensile specimen e. g., SENT (single edge notch tension), have the lowest constraint, while specimens dominated by bending have the highest constraint. In this paper, the woven carbon/epoxy composite material with eight lamina was produced which has a volume fraction of carbon fiber of approximately 60 % mechanical properties of this woven composite have been calculated. The fracture <b>toughness</b> <b>value</b> was measured by using the crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) method experimentally.

The J-integral is applied to character the fracture initiation of a tough polymer for which the concept of linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) are inapplicable for reasonably sized specimen due to extensive plasticity. In this paper, the multiple specimen resistance curve technique was employed for J-integral. The normal single side notched three-point bend (3 PB) specimen was used to study the characteristic fracture parameter of high-density polyethylene pipe and its butt-fusion joints at different temperature. Testing results show that values of characteristic fracture parameter are affected by the welding process and experimental temperature respectively. The <b>toughness</b> <b>value</b> of HDPE butt-fusion joint is lowered than that of HDPE pipe.

40|$|During {{the impact}} of thin {{composite}} panels, well-defined flaps can develop on the exit face {{as a consequence of}} through-thickness penetration of the panel. For certain materials (for example, CFRP panels based on plies of plain-woven fabric) the flaps develop as four triangles, with the apex of each triangle at the point of impact. As the impactor is driven through the panel, the flap (i. e. crack) lengths increase, until complete penetration of the panel by the impactor occurs. In the experiments described within this paper, CFRP panels fabricated from epoxy resin reinforced with plain-woven carbon fibre fabrics have been impacted using controlled multiple impact tests. During these tests, the impactor is driven at a controlled velocity to a particular depth of penetration through the composite panel, withdrawn, and then driven further through the panel subsequently. The experimental results show that the dependence of the flap compliance is proportional to the square of the flap length, which is in agreement with theoretical predictions. This compliance/crack-length also enables a <b>toughness</b> <b>value</b> for the composite panel to be derived that is directly relevant to through-thickness impact.
