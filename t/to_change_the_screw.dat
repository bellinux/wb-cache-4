40|$|Manufacturers {{utilizing}} both post-consumer resins (PCRs) and virgin resins {{often have}} difficulty producing a homogenous materials mix. The ability {{to obtain a}} homogeneous PCR/virgin mix is affected by such PCR materials characteristics as varying melt points, viscosity levels, densities, and form (flake or pellet). An often overlooked remedy to a poor materials mix is <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> design of the machine being used in product manufacture. Optimizing the screw design for use with PCR materials enables manufacturers to obtain consistent processing characteristics and contributes to maximizing material properties. This may result in improved output, increased recycled content, or better performance properties. This technology brief provides background information on plastics processing screws and highlights the important points to consider when evaluating screw design for use with PCR materials. The Plastic Screw The plastic screw {{is an essential part}} of all extrusion, injection and blow molding machines. The screw is a helically flighted shaft that rotates within a cylindrical housing called a barrel. The screw’s purpose is to mechanically mix, melt and advance the material being processed into a mold or die (2). Typical Screw. Schematic courtesy of Xaloy, Inc. The typical screw is composed of three sections, each designed for a specific purpose. The feed sectio...|$|E
50|$|In 1939, Kamerawerk Niedersedlitz Dresden {{presented}} the Praktiflex at the Leipzig spring fair. The camera was a waist type with a M40x1 screw mount and a horizontal cloth focal shutter. This camera is {{the pattern for}} most of the 35 mm SLR cameras, and also the japanese and the digital SLR cameras today. After the war, Praktiflex was the most manufactured 35 mm SLR in Dresden, especially for the Russians as reparations. KW <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> M42 <b>screw</b> mount invented at Zeiss for Contax S. In 1949, it was redesigned with longer shutter speeds. <b>The</b> name was <b>changed</b> <b>to</b> Praktica. In 1958, KW Niedersedlitz became a part of the VEB Kamera- und Kinowerk (old Zeiss), later VEB Pentacon. Praktica was typically a consumer/ amateur camera. Many developments were added.

30|$|As {{the plate}} is pre-contoured, {{it does not}} seat equally well in all {{patients}} and bending the plate can potentially damage <b>the</b> locking hole <b>screw</b> threads and can also <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> direction <b>to</b> a certain extent.

To circumvent this problem, plate bending should be done after blocking <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> holes with locking sleeves and bending the plate only in between <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> holes.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT There are {{few studies}} about the {{treatment}} options for cranial cruciate ligament rupture in growing dogs, especially with epiphysiodesis techniques. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the electrocautery technique for proximal tibial epiphysiodesis in Labrador retriever puppies. The novel electrocautery technique was compared with <b>the</b> <b>screw</b> technique regarding <b>the</b> efficacy for tibial plateau leveling in growing dogs. Six healthy Labrador retriever puppies were divided into two groups. <b>The</b> <b>screw</b> technique was used in one group and the electrocautery technique was used in the other group. Both proximal tibial epiphysiodesis techniques for tibial plateau leveling were effective in achieving reduced tibial plateau angle and did not cause significant joint <b>changes.</b> <b>The</b> <b>screw</b> technique was more invasive and caused slightly greater morbidity than the electrocautery technique. The electrocautery technique seems to be a good alternative for proximal tibial epiphysiodesis in young dogs...|$|R

These tests were all successful, but the river current interfered with some tests, so Fulton took the boat to Le Havre {{to work in the}} quiet salt water of the harbor. He tested endurance with a candle lit, and found the flame did not challenge the air capacity of the snorkel. He also tested the speed of his two men cranking against that of two men rowing on the surface. Nautilus covered the 360 ft course two minutes faster than the rowing crew.
