25|$|The {{chest was}} a very {{important}} piece of furniture, and is often to be met with covered with the most elaborate carving (Orleans Museum). There is a splendid chest (14th century) in the Cluny Museum; the front is carved with twelve knights in armour standing under as many arches, and the spandrels are filled in with faces, dragons and so on. But it is to the 15th century <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> for the best work of this class; there is no finer example than that in the Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin. The front is a very animated hunting scene most decoratively arranged in a scheme of foliage, and the top bears two coats of arms with helms, crests and mantling. But the more general custom in chest decoration was to employ tracery with or without figure work; Avignon Museum contains some typical examples of the latter class.|$|E

Manager Arsène Wenger used his press conference to look ahead to the new season and felt his team's chances were as good, if not better than Chelsea's: [...] "I can understand <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> a little bit poor and out of shape but what is important is what happens on the pitch and you will see <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> good.

Wade recognizes that his ideas may not be acceptable to everyone but warns that [...] "to falter in scientific inquiry would be a retreat into darkness". He seems to be warning, appropriately enough, against benighted political correctness. But we should never become casual about how comparable [...] "slopular" [...] science and very similar speculative evolutionary reasoning by leading scientists fed a venomous kind of darkness not too many decades ago. Wade's post-hoc tales often put him in step with a long march of social darwinists who, with comfortable detachment from the (currently) dominant culture, insist <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> starkly at life in the raw and not blink at what we see.|$|E

500|$|Several {{references}} to popular culture, including a meta-reference to The Simpsons, {{are included in}} [...] "The Ten-Per-Cent Solution". The three The Itchy & Scratchy cartoons that are shown {{at the beginning of}} the episode as Krusty is hosting his show are all parodies of films released in 2010: the first one, titled The Cat's Speech, is a parody of The King's Speech; the second one, titled The Social Petwork, parodies The Social Network in that the storyline is partially explained through the use of screens containing nothing but text; and the final one, titled Black and Blue Swan, references Black Swan. [...] After the three cartoons are shown, Krusty points out that [...] "It’s like those parodies were written when the movies came out, but it took so long to animate them <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> dated and hacky!" [...] This is a reference to the long time it takes to produce an episode of The Simpsons—hence why cultural references on the show can often be seen as dated. Pop culture allusions at the television museum include a brief appearance by the main characters of the animated series King of the Hill as cardboard cutouts being taken down in a process similar to the opening of the show, an exhibit devoted to the sitcom The Beverly Hillbillies, and the showing of one of Homer's favorite television shows, Fatso Flanagan, which is a knockoff of the sitcom The Honeymooners.|$|E

We have got to assure them that we will never allow a second Holocaust, despite, again, warnings from Iran and any other country that would seek to destroy Israel, {{that that is what}} they would like to see.

Let no one have any doubts about it: we are celebrating a religious occasion; we are reflecting on a religious assassination, not a political one. Fr. Kaiser has been murdered because he was, and in the eternity of God still is, a Catholic priest who preached the Gospel. Those who killed him, those who planned his killing, wanted to silence the voice of the Gospel.... Only two days before his death, I met Fr. Kaiser for a long conversation. At the end, he asked my blessing, which I reluctantly gave him. At that moment, I thought {{it would have been better}} if he, an old and worthy missionary, had blessed me.

2500|$|Fellow crime writer Anthony Berkeley Cox, writing {{under the}} nom de plume of Francis Iles, {{reviewed}} the novel in the 6 December 1957 issue of The Guardian, {{in which he}} confessed to being disappointed with the work: [...] "I have only pity for those poor souls who cannot enjoy the sprightly stories of Agatha Christie; but though sprightliness is {{not the least of}} this remarkable writer's qualities, there is another <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> for in her, and that is detection: genuine, steady, logical detection, taking us step by step nearer {{to the heart of the}} mystery. Unfortunately it is that quality that is missing in 4.50 from Paddington. The police never seem to find out a single thing, and even Miss Marples (sic) lies low and says nuffin' to the point until the final dramatic exposure. There is the usual small gallery of interesting and perfectly credible characters and nothing could be easier to read. But please, Mrs Christie, a little more of that incomparable detection next time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Morton starred as {{a mother}} in the First World War context in Cider with Rosie, a made-for-television {{adaptation}} of the book with the same name by Laurie Lee. The film, described by The Telegraph as a [...] "lyrical, languid and poetic" [...] production, aired on BBC One in September 2015. In the same year, she took on {{a leading role in}} the European limited television series The Last Panthers. The six-part crime drama, inspired by the notorious Balkan jewel thieves the Pink Panthers, saw her play an insurance investigator charged with recovering stolen diamonds whatever the cost. Morton found her character to be a [...] "very truthful, [...] strong woman" [...] and described her as a [...] "female Bond". The show was broadcast on Sky Atlantic in the UK, and on SundanceTV in the US, to generally favourable reviews and moderate attention from viewers. Genevieve Valentine for The AV Club wrote: [...] "Morton might at first seem a tough sell as someone so hard-boiled, but the taciturn, untouchable edifice she presents is leaking just enough poison at the edges <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> forward to watching her strike—the sort of character a six-hour miniseries was made for".|$|E

It's just that the really sloppy platforming and box-moving, which take up {{a good chunk of}} the game, puts a big damper on any joy that we might find in shooting up bandits and cowboys." [...] Sterling McGarvey also scored the Xbox 360 version 2.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "yet another Tex-Mex shooter that seems to have been made by a bunch of guys who've watched a few too many Westerns but haven't figured out how to get the ambience and authenticity of the historical period down." [...] He praised the shooting mechanics, but concluded [...] "For the most part, Call of Juarez has taken two core ideas and melded them into a game. [...] There will be inevitable comparisons to Neversoft's GUN, but CoJ feels much more a next-gen version of the lackluster Dead Man's Hand than anything else." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash asked why, in [...] Jacob [...] "offered {{sacrifices to}} the God {{of his father}} Isaac," [...] {{and not to the}} God of Abraham and Isaac. Judah ben Pedayah, the nephew of Ben HaKappar, {{explained}} that when one encounters a teacher and the teacher's disciple walking on a road, one first greets the disciple and then the teacher. Rabbi Johanan said that the reason was because a person owes more honor to a parent than to a grandparent. Resh Lakish said that Jacob offered sacrifices (in thanksgiving) for the covenant with the ancestors (which Isaac had conveyed to Jacob with his blessing). Bar Kappara discussed the question with Rabbi Jose bar Patros. One of them said that Jacob declared that as Isaac had been eager for his food (for, as [...] reports, Isaac loved Esau because Esau brought Isaac venison), so Jacob was eager for his food (and thus was headed to Egypt to avoid the famine). The other explained that as Isaac had distinguished between his sons (as [...] reports, loving Esau more than Jacob), so Jacob would distinguish among his sons (going to Egypt for Joseph's account alone). But then Jacob noted on reconsideration that Isaac was responsible for only one soul, whereas Jacob was responsible for 70 souls. Rabbi Judan said that Jacob declared that Isaac blessed him with five blessings, and God correspondingly appeared five times to Jacob and blessed him (in [...] and [...] ). Rabbi Judan also said that Jacob wanted to thank God for permitting Jacob to see the fulfillment of those blessings. And the blessing that was fulfilled was that of [...] "Let people serve you, and nations bow down to you," [...] which was fulfilled with regard to Joseph. (And thus Jacob mentioned Isaac then on going down to witness Joseph's greatness.) Rabbi Berekiah observed that God never unites God's Name with a living person (to say, for example, [...] "I am the God of Jacob," [...] while they are alive) except with those who are experiencing suffering. (And thus Jacob referred to the God of Isaac instead of the God of Jacob.) And Rabbi Berekiah also observed that Isaac did indeed experience suffering. The Rabbis said <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> upon Isaac as if his ashes were heaped in a pile on the altar. (And thus Jacob referred to Isaac to invoke the memory of Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac in [...] {{as if it had been}} carried out).|$|E
