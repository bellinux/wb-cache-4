40|$|Background: Plantar {{fasciitis}} is {{a painful}} condition caused by microtrauma to plantar fascia due to overuse. It {{is a most}} common cause of heel pain in runners. Various studies proved <b>taping</b> <b>and</b> Iontophoresis as effective in the treating plantar fasciitis. But there are no studies comparing the combined effect of iontophoresis with <b>taping</b> <b>and</b> <b>taping</b> alone in the treatment of plantar fasciitis. Methods: 50 patients suffering from plantar fasciitis who met the inclusion criteria were selected. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups i. e. Group A and Group B. Group A received taping, iontophoresis with plantar fascia stretching. Group B received <b>taping</b> <b>and</b> plantar fascia stretching. A total of 6 treatment sessions were given on alternate days over a period of two weeks for both the groups. Results: VAS and FFI scores across baseline and post intervention showed a significant improvement statistically in their mean scores between Groups A and B (P< 0. 05). Between group comparison of VAS and FFI scores, it showed that subject treated with Iontophoresis in combination with <b>taping</b> <b>and</b> plantar fascia stretch (Group A) had significant improvement in VAS and functional ability when compared to subjects treated with <b>taping</b> <b>and</b> plantar fascia stretching alone (Group B). Conclusion: Iontophoresis along with <b>Taping</b> <b>and</b> plantar fascia stretching gave an additional benefit when compared with <b>Taping</b> <b>and</b> plantar fascia stretching alone in reducing pain and improving function in plantar fasciitis.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the differences in electromyographic (EMG) activities of upper limb muscles between cross- <b>and</b> parallel-aligned <b>taping</b> <b>and</b> to compare the effects of these 2 taping methods in healthy adults. Thirty subjects, who volunteered for this study, were tested under 3 taping conditions in random order: (1) no taping, (2) cross-aligned <b>taping,</b> <b>and</b> (3) parallel-aligned <b>taping.</b> EMG activities of the biceps brachii, triceps brachii, flexor carpi ulnaris, and extensor carpi radialis muscles were measured. All muscles showed significant differences in EMG activity among the 3 conditions (p<. 05). In the post hoc test, biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles showed significant differences in EMG activity between the no <b>taping</b> <b>and</b> the cross-aligned <b>taping</b> conditions <b>and</b> between the no <b>taping</b> <b>and</b> the parallel-aligned <b>taping</b> conditions. Additionally, the EMG activities of the flexor carpi radialis and extensor carpi radialis muscles appeared to be significantly different between the no <b>taping</b> <b>and</b> parallel-aligned <b>taping</b> conditions. These findings demonstrate that taping may be helpful for decreasing muscle activity, regardless of the direction of tape application. This study provides useful information to future researchers regarding the effects of taping on muscle activity...|$|R

His success continued through the early 1980s until he invested heavily in the Technicolor Compact Video Cassette (CVC), a 1/4in(0.6cm) system designed to compete with Betamax, VHS, and the Super 8 film home-movie system. The CVC format failed in the marketplace, sales quickly eroded, and Muntz's store closed soon after.|$|E

In December 1973, Lennon collaborated with Phil Spector to record the oldies album, Rock 'n' Roll. The alcohol-fueled recording sessions became legendary. Every musician in L.A. wanted to participate, but soon Lennon's drinking and Spector's erratic behavior (which included his firing a gun in the studio control room) caused the sessions to break down. Then Spector, who claimed to have been in a car accident, took the sessions <b>tapes</b> <b>and</b> was unreachable.|$|E

5|$|At first clients sent hole-punched {{accounting}} records to a Reynolds processing center, which would print a complete accounting that is {{sent back to}} the client by mail. The development of modems and internet technology in the 1970s led to several advancements. Reynolds provided 3,600 specialized modems to dealerships between 1974 and 1978. The modems communicated with Reynolds' VIM-brand minicomputers at 80 Reynolds locations, which provided computing power and printed forms. This eliminated the need for clients to ship data to Reynolds in <b>tapes</b> <b>and</b> allowed daily access to online services. By the end of the 1970s, batch processing and computer processing centers were being phased out in response to personal computers kept at the dealership. In the years 1978 and 1982, Reynolds introduced VIM-brand computer systems that were kept at dealerships.|$|E
