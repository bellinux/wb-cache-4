5|$|The actor John Payne {{attempted}} {{to take up}} the option on the film rights to the book in 1955, but nothing came of the attempt. The Rank Organisation also came to an agreement to make a film, but this likewise fell <b>through.</b> <b>The</b> <b>novel</b> was not one of Fleming's stories acquired by Eon Productions in 1961; in 1969 the company acquired the rights and commissioned Gerry Anderson to produce and co-write a screenplay. Anderson and Tony Barwick prepared a 70-page treatment that was never filmed, but some elements were similar to the final screenplay of The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E

500|$|A Wizard of Earthsea {{focuses on}} Ged's {{adolescence}} and coming of age, {{and along with}} the other two works of the original Earthsea trilogy forms a part of Le Guin's dynamic portrayal of the process of growing old. The three novels together follow Ged from youth to old age, each of them also follow the coming of age of a different character. The novel is frequently described as a Bildungsroman. Mike Cadden stated that the book is a convincing tale [...] "to a reader as young and possibly as headstrong as Ged, and therefore sympathetic to him". Ged's coming of age is also intertwined with the physical journey he undertakes <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b>|$|E

500|$|After this incident, {{she falls}} ill and {{experiences}} nightmares, suggesting {{that when she}} underwent the rituals that made her the [...] "eaten one", some of her personality and her regard for life remained. She questions her faith (another theme that runs <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel),</b> and begins to {{develop a sense of}} self apart from it, helped in this process by Ged. She wrestles with her contradictory thoughts for a long time; keeping Ged alive would be contrary to all her teachings and the powers she serves, but sacrificing him would be contrary to her developing respect for life. An important moment in this process is when Ged calls her by her true name, and clarifies for her the choice between remaining in the Tombs as Arha and embracing Tenar and stepping into the larger world of Earthsea. Afterwards she has a nightmare about suffocating, a motif Cummins describes as being common to female coming-of-age stories.|$|E
500|$|Bette's {{relationship}} with Valérie is layered with overtones of lesbianism. Early {{in the book}} Bette is [...] "captée" [...] ("bewitched") by Valérie, and quickly declares to her: [...] "Je vous aime, je vous estime, je suis à vous!" [...] ("I love you, I esteem you, I am wholly yours!") This affection may have been platonic, but neighbors of the Marneffes– along with many readers– suspect that their bond transcends friendship. As with Steinbock, Bette and Valérie assume butch and femme roles; the narration even mentions [...] "Le contraste de la mâle et sèche nature de la Lorraine avec la jolie nature créole de Valérie" [...] ("The contrast between Lisbeth's dry masculine nature and Valerie's creole prettiness"). The homoeroticism evolves <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel,</b> as Bette feeds on Valérie's power to seduce and control the Hulot men. As one critic says: [...] "Valérie's body becomes, at least symbolically, the locus of Bette's only erotic pleasure." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{extraterrestrial}} civilizations {{are also}} depicted. The [...] "Arachnids" [...] or [...] "Bugs" [...] are shown as communal beings originating {{from the planet}} of Klendathu. They have multiple castes; workers, soldiers, brains, and queens, similar to ants and termites. The soldiers {{are the only ones}} who fight, and are unable to surrender in battle. The [...] "Skinnies" [...] are depicted as less communal than the Arachnids but more so than human beings. The events of the novel take place during an interstellar war between the Terran Federation and the Arachnids. At the beginning of the story, Earth is not at war, but war has been declared by the time Rico has completed his training. The Skinnies are initially allies of the Arachnids, but switch to being allies of the humans midway <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b> Faster-than-light travel exists in this future: spacecraft operate under the [...] "Cherenkov drive", and can travel [...] "Sol to Capella, forty-six lightyears, in under six weeks".|$|E

500|$|Other reviewers {{were less}} enthusiastic. The Daily Telegraphs Catherine Taylor found the protagonist [...] "a little too credulous." [...] She also found McEwan's [...] "wilful {{narrative}} sadism" [...] sadly {{missing from the}} work. The review in The Economist was even more scathing: referring to Sweet Tooth as [...] "not Mr McEwan's finest book", the reviewer concluded that by the end, [...] "it is hard to feel much of anything for these heroes, who are all notions and no depth." [...] James Lasdun of The Guardian {{found that there were}} [...] "momentous political questions" [...] raised in the earlier parts of the novel, which were not fully addressed by the end. Stylistically, Serena found herself caught in exactly the kind of narrative she disliked, but, asked Lasdun, [...] "to what end?" [...] Particularly the ending of the book was polarising. Kellaway saw it as [...] "a good excuse {{to go back to the}} beginning and read this rich and enjoyable novel all over again", while another reviewer confessed that, though the ending [...] "might be enough to send McEwan acolytes scurrying back <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> to see how he did it... it made me want to throw the book out the window." ...|$|E
500|$|Stirling was {{concerned}} by {{the proximity of the}} coast and hailed Pique with orders to anchor before it grounded, but Milne did not hear the order correctly and instead increased sail, lurching ahead of Jason and straight onto a sandbank close to La Tranche-sur-Mer on the Vendée coast. Seine too had struck the shore a little distance ahead, and Stirling was unable to arrest Jasons momentum before his ship too became stuck, lying between Pique and Seine. The French ship had been badly damaged in the crash, all three masts collapsing overboard at impact, but actually lay in a stronger position: Jason blocked Piques arc of fire and Stirling's ship had swung with the rising tide, leaving its stern exposed. Bigot took advantage of this position to fire several raking broadsides into Jason, during which Stirling was wounded and command passed to Lieutenant Charles Inglis. Inglis responded to the fire by cutting stern gunports to fire chase guns at Seine, and Milne succeeded in dragging his frigate around <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> expedient of ordering his men to run towards the bows carrying round shot. This sudden shift in weight gently rotated the grounded ship to face Seine and Milne could direct four of his 12-pounder long guns at the French ship. [...] Under fire and with Mermaid finally approaching, Bigot determined that further resistance was hopeless and struck his colours.|$|E
500|$|Clarke's {{style has}} {{frequently}} {{been described as}} a pastiche, particularly of nineteenth-century British writers such as Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, and George Meredith. Specifically, the novel's minor characters, including sycophants, rakes, and the Duke of Wellington, evoke Dickens' caricatures. Laura Miller, in her review for Salon, suggests that the novel is [...] "about a certain literary voice, the eminently civilized voice of early 19th century social comedy", exemplified by the works of Austen. The novel even uses obsolete spellings—chuse for choose and shewed for showed, for example—to convey this voice as well as the free indirect speech made famous by Austen. Clarke herself notes that Austen's influence is particularly strong in the [...] "domestic scenes, set in living rooms and drawing rooms where people mostly chat about magic" [...] where Dickens's is prominent [...] "any time there's more action or description". While many reviewers compare Clarke's style to that of Austen, Gregory Feeley argues in his review for The Weekly Standard that [...] "the points of resemblance are mostly superficial". He writes that [...] "Austen gets down to business briskly, while Clarke engages in a curious narrative strategy of continual deferral and delay." [...] For example, Clarke mentions Jonathan Strange on the first page of the novel, but only in a footnote. He reappears in other footnotes throughout the opening but does not appear as a character in the text proper until a quarter of the way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to Eleanor Coerr's story {{first published in}} 1977, Sadako's story has become familiar to many school children around <b>the</b> world <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>novels</b> <b>The</b> Day of the Bomb (1961, in German, Sadako will leben) by the Austrian writer Karl Bruckner.

500|$|Starship Troopers {{has been}} {{referred}} to as a bildungsroman or [...] "coming-of-age" [...] story for Rico, as he matures through his tenure in the infantry. His training, both at boot camp and at officer candidate school, involves learning the value of militarism, thus inviting the reader to learn it as well. This is especially true of the parts of his training that involve indoctrination, such as the claim by one of his instructors that rule by military veterans is the ideal form of government, because only they understand how to put collective well-being above the individual. The story traces Rico's transformation from a boy into a soldier, while exploring issues of identity and motivation, and traces his overall moral and social development, in a manner identified by commentators as similar to many stories about German soldiers in World War I. Rico's transformation has been likened to the common narrative within stories with military themes by scholar Howard Franklin. This typical narrative is that of a sloppy and unfit civilian being knocked into shape by tough officers, whose training is [...] "calculated sadism" [...] but is depicted as fundamentally being on the right side. The letter Rico receives from Dubois, partly responsible for Rico [...] "crossing the hump" [...] with his training, is shown as a turning point in his development. The classroom scenes embedded in the story serve to explain Rico's adventures, and highlight his reactions to events around. A notable example is the execution Rico is forced to witness after a deserter from his unit murders a young girl; Rico is uncertain of his own reaction until he remembers a lecture by Dubois in which the latter argues that [...] "moral sense" [...] derives entirely from the will to survive. The concept of the American frontier is also related to the coming-of-age theme. Young protagonists across Heinlein's novels attain manhood by confronting a hostile [...] "wilderness" [...] in space; coming-of-age in a military, alien context is a common theme in Heinlein's earlier works as well. Rico's coming-of-age has also been described as being related to his relationship with his father; the journey [...] "outward" [...] <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> also contains a search for Rico's childhood and a reunion with his estranged parent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{novel is}} {{partially}} {{set at a}} film noir festival. [...] Krentz brings this theme <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b> [...] The book references many classic noir films, and the plotting essentially puts the characters in a real film noir situation.|$|E

2500|$|Orr is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the classic novel Catch-22 [...] by Joseph Heller. Orr is a World War II bomber pilot who shares a tent with his good friend, the protagonist of the novel, Yossarian. Described as [...] "a warm-hearted, simple-minded gnome," [...] Orr is generally considered crazy. His most notable feature is repeatedly being shot down over water, but, until his final flight, always managing to survive along with his entire crew.

2500|$|Taylor Caldwell's The Arm and the Darkness (1943) also {{deals with}} this period in France, while Hilda Lewis' Wife to Great Buckingham (1959) {{goes so far}} as to make Buckingham's love for the French queen the main cause of his undoing. The Duke also figures in {{historical}} romances like Evelyn Anthony's Charles, The King (1963) and Bertrice Small's Darling Jasmine (2007), although the main focus there is on other protagonists. In Philippa Gregory's Earthly Joys (1998), which has as its subject the famous gardener John Tradescant the elder; the bewitching Duke appears halfway <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> as the object of Tradescant's love. [...] Another historical fiction, Ronald Blythe's The Assassin (2004), is written from his killer's point of view as a final confession while awaiting execution in the Tower of London.|$|E
2500|$|The {{novel is}} thematically complex, {{exploring}} {{the effect of}} the War on identity, masculinity, and social structure. Moreover, the novel draws extensively on period psychological practices, emphasising River's research as well as Freudian psychology. <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel</b> Barker enters a particular tradition of representing the experience of World War I in literature: many critics compare the novel to other , especially those written by women writers interested in the domestic repercussions of the war, including Rebecca West's The Return of the Soldier (1918) and Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway (1925). Barker both drew on those texts of the period that initially inspired her and makes references to a number of other literary and cultural works and events. These give an impression of historical realism, even though Barker tends to refute the claim that the novel is [...] "historical fiction".|$|E
2500|$|The {{opening scene}} of the novel {{describes}} Sophie's perceptions of the small Ohio town. [...] She distrusts small towns and sees the landscape as ominous. [...] The last scene is a transformation of the first; Sophie views the same scenery through her new perspective and experiences it as happy and hopeful. [...] The theme is carried <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>novel.</b> [...] Sophie is preoccupied with the fading wallpaper in her kitchen; {{in the beginning of}} the book, she sees them as cherries, which reminds her of the humiliation that followed her first sexual experience. [...] Later in the novel, it is revealed that the images are actually apples. [...] The description of the water tower, likewise, evolves from a penis to lipstick to a breast. [...] With these [...] "shifting visual images", Crusie demonstrates that initial assumptions are often false. [...] This theme manifests even more explicitly with the movie the characters are filming. [...] Multiple iterations exist - depending on the perceptions of the character, the movie could be a documentary, soft-core porn, or hard-code porn.|$|E
50|$|A {{marriage}} {{based on}} love was rarely {{an option for}} most women in the British Regency, as securing a steady and sufficient income was the first consideration for both {{the woman and her}} family.
