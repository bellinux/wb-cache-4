5|$|In 1990, the IRS seized most of Nelson's assets, {{claiming}} that he owed US$32,000,000. In addition to the unpaid taxes, Nelson's situation was worsened by the weak investments he had made during the early 1980s. In 1978, after he fired Reshen, Nelson was introduced by Dallas lawyer Terry Bray to the accounting firm Price Waterhouse. To repay the debt Reshen had created with the IRS, Nelson was recommended to invest in <b>tax</b> <b>shelters</b> that ultimately flopped. While the IRS disallowed his deductions for 1980, 1981 and 1982 (at a time that Nelson's income multiplied), due to penalties and interests, the debt increased {{by the end of}} the decade.|$|E

Near the end of his life, Caspersen was subjected to an IRS audit with a possible focus on alleged offshore accounts. An attorney for Caspersen’s estate claimed that in 2013 the IRS effectively exonerated Caspersen posthumously—with no penalties or fines for offshore accounts or anything else.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, I.R.S. issued summonses to KPMG for {{information}} about certain <b>tax</b> <b>shelters</b> and their investors. In February 2004, the U.S. justice Department commenced a criminal inquiry. The United States member firm, KPMG LLP, has been accused by the United States Department of Justice of fraud in marketing abusive <b>tax</b> <b>shelters.</b> KPMG fired or forced the retirement of over a dozen who were involved. KPMG LLP admitted criminal wrongdoing in creating fraudulent <b>tax</b> <b>shelters</b> to help wealthy clients avoid $2.5 billion in taxes between 1996 and 2002 and agreed to pay $456 million in penalties to avoid indictment. Under the deferred prosecution agreement, KPMG LLP would not face criminal prosecution if it complied with the terms of its agreement with the government. On 3 January 2007, the criminal conspiracy charges against KPMG were dropped.|$|E

25|$|Various {{efforts have}} been made to {{quantify}} the relationship between tax revenue and tax rates (for example, in the United States by the Congressional Budget Office). While the interaction between tax rates and tax revenue is generally accepted, the precise nature of this interaction is debated. In practice, the shape of a hypothetical Laffer curve for a given economy can only be estimated. The relationship between tax rate and tax revenue is likely to vary from one economy to another and depends on the elasticity of supply for labor, as well as various other factors. Even in the same economy, the characteristics of the curve could vary over time. Complexities such as progressive taxes and possible differences in the incentive to work for different income groups complicate the task of estimation. The structure of the curve may also be changed by policy decisions. For example, if tax loopholes and <b>tax</b> <b>shelters</b> are made more readily available by legislation, the point at which revenue begins to decrease with increased taxation is likely to become lower.|$|E

500|$|In the 1980s, Arabians {{became a}} popular status symbol and were marketed {{similarly}} to fine art. Some individuals also used horses {{as a tax}} shelter. Prices skyrocketed, especially in the United States, with a record-setting public auction price for a mare named NH Love Potion, who sold for $2.55million in 1984, and the largest syndication in history for an Arabian stallion, Padron, at $11,000,000. The potential for profit led to over-breeding of the Arabian. When the Tax Reform Act of 1986 closed the tax-sheltering [...] "passive investment" [...] loophole, limiting the use of horse farms as <b>tax</b> <b>shelters,</b> the Arabian market was particularly vulnerable due to over-saturation and artificially inflated prices, and it collapsed, forcing many breeders into bankruptcy and sending many purebred Arabians to slaughter.
