6000|$|... "And now, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> affairs, Francisco. Where was it {{you fell}} in with the Genoese galley, and by what miracle did you get off?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "WW: Can you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>your</b> {{cooperation with}} Frank Zappa? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Amen," [...] murmured the widow, as Will {{drained the}} glass; [...] "I hope {{they may get}} plenty of gold without {{catching}} the gold-fever, which is just {{another name for the}} love of gold, and that, you know, is the root of all evil. But go on <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> adventures, Will; I never tire of hearing you relate them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll be {{frivolous}} enough {{later on}} this evening. I've been wondering if you'd think it impertinent if I asked you to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> guardian." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I've {{no doubt}} you have much to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> trip, and if you'll talk about Edinburgh and London, I won't let anybody in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{this they}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> saving a man's life?" [...] he asked, sinking {{into one of}} the vacant chairs and {{regarding}} Austen with his twinkling eyes.|$|E
40|$|Please <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> {{the changes}} in the {{situation}} of the Urum people in the last twenty years. The best {{way to do this is}} to start by <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> and/or your families experiences at the time Georgia became independent. Try to remember those events and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> the course of events until today. Please take your time in doing this and give me all the details you consider important, because I am interested in everything that is important for you. ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to hear this. Will you please <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> more <b>about</b> <b>your</b> {{troubles}} with the Skeezers? Then perhaps I can help you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{have settled}} it. Poor unhappy man! We will talk of {{something}} more pleasant. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> shipwreck, and that place,--Aberalva, is it not? What a pretty name!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't mention them!" [...] she cried. [...] "Let them build tower on tower, spire on spire, crypts, picture galleries, altars, confessionals, if they like. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> new cook." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad I {{can take}} your word, Mr. Johnstone. Now I must ask you to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> recent adventures on the sands. You see, I'm in touch with Lieutenant Rankine and the coastguards." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, I don't {{intend to}} walk home; I shall take a cab," [...] said the mild little woman. [...] "Do <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{something}} <b>about</b> <b>your</b> department." ...|$|R
6000|$|He sat not {{far from}} {{opposite}} to her at table, and could sometimes hear what she said in answer to Sir Hugo, who was at his liveliest in conversation with her; but though he looked toward her {{with the intention of}} bowing, she gave him no opportunity of doing so for some time. At last Sir Hugo, who might have imagined that they had already spoken to each other, said, [...] "Deronda, you will like to hear what Mrs. Grandcourt <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> favorite Klesmer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “We’ll {{let that}} go; I need help. You can {{begin with the}} {{stacking}} gang, but something better may turn up. Now <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> something <b>about</b> <b>your</b> northern trip.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> {{uncle and}} aunt,' the good lady began, when Constance was seated beside her. 'Yes, I {{have heard from}} Mrs. Bury, but I {{want to know whether}} the place is tolerably comfortable.' ...|$|E
60|$|BOHUN (pouncing forward again). Stop. You're {{going to}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> feelings, Mr. Crampton. Don't: I sympathize with them; but they're not my business. Tell us {{exactly what you}} want: that's {{what we have to}} get at.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go down {{to dinner}} and smile upon everybody, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> conquests to-morrow. And say to your dear papa, that as he is so kind as to wish to see me, I will join them after dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{question}} is withdrawn, Mr. Brice," [...] said the Judge, [...] "Virginia, you may strike {{it from the}} records. And now, sir, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> something <b>about</b> <b>your</b> trip." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were not}} so laconic at the ranch," [...] said the girl, who smiled at him. [...] "Once upon a time you would <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>your</b> plans." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{much for}} our doings; now sit down comfortably in my tent, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>your</b> journey. I see you have brought Pierre and your two men back with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] he said, [...] "I {{dare say}} I could, but I hadn't {{the time to}} spare to look them up. Now <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> visit to England. Where {{are you going to}} stay? In the country or in London?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> farm in South Africa. It always stimulates my {{imagination}} {{to think of}} these places. I can fancy all the tall ostriches being driven out by a black herd--to graze, I suppose. How do ostriches feed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} be bashful. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> adventures in the mountains, with all the hairbreadth escapes, fantastic coloring, and romantic medley of {{incidents}} that must be crowded {{into the life of}} anyone engaged in such work as yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|JOHNNY. Ah! <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>your</b> beastly time; it'll do you good. You and I are {{different}} from anybody else in this house. We've lived they've just vegetated. Come on; <b>tell</b> <b>me!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come here," [...] said Nootka--of {{course in}} Eskimo--as she dragged rather than led her new friend into the boudoir; [...] "I {{want you to}} <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>your</b> saving my brother's life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} your story, Myeerah, {{and it is}} wonderful. You must <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>your</b> life with the Indians. You speak my {{language}} almost as well as I do. Who taught you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} girl, with {{a twinkle in}} her eyes, [...] "I came across two {{successful}} prospectors in Vancouver not long ago, and there was really nothing to suggest it in their appearance. So you didn't find the mine? Won't you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> journey?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She's {{pretty in}} an unformed way, {{which is more}} to the purpose," [...] Mrs. Chudleigh rejoined. [...] "I heard the old woman abusing the manager because one of her ridiculous pets is missing. But this is of no consequence.

6000|$|... "Aunt {{seems to}} be asleep, but she isn't," [...] she declared. [...] "She is really a very {{efficient}} chaperon. Talk to me about China, please, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>about</b> <b>your</b> Dragon airship.

6000|$|... "Hwat!" [...] shrieked the old lady. [...] "Mr. Hwat? Mais, ma chere, c'est impayable. Come along--here's the carr'age! Give me your arm, Mr. Hwat, and get inside, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>your</b> {{thirteen}} aunts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I come West," [...] said Moss, sincerely, [...] "we'll go camping together, {{and every}} night by the fire we'll smoke and you can <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all <b>about</b> <b>your</b> journeys. I assure you they are epic to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will find," [...] Pamela {{warned her}} {{companion}} almost {{as they took}} their places, [...] "that I am a very curious person. I am more interested in people than in events. <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> something <b>about</b> <b>your</b> work at the War Office?" ...|$|R
