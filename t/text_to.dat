5|$|Sima Daad {{from the}} Department of Comparative Literature at the University of Washington {{feels that the}} {{creative}} merit of Kiarostami's adaptation of Sohrab Sepehri and Forough Farrokhzad's poems extends the domain of textual transformation. Adaptation {{is defined as the}} transformation of a prior <b>text</b> <b>to</b> a new text. Kiarostami's adaptation arrives at theoretical realm of adaptation by expanding its limit from inter-textual potential to trans-generic potential.|$|E

5|$|The Telugu {{version of}} the Yogatattva Upanishad has 142 verses, while the {{shortest}} surviving manuscript in Sanskrit is just 15 verses.

He wrote the critically acclaimed artist's book Agrippa (a book of the dead) in 1992 before co-authoring The Difference Engine, an alternate history novel that would become a central work of the steampunk genre. He then spent an unfruitful period as a Hollywood screenwriter, with few of his projects seeing the light of day and those that did being critically unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{aesthetic}} {{involved with the}} poetry goes much farther {{back in time and}} is used much more subtly than these examples suggest. Beyond issues of adaptation of <b>text</b> <b>to</b> film, Kiarostami often begins with an insistent will to give visual embodiment to certain specific image-making techniques in Persian poetry, both classical and contemporary, and often ends up enunciating a larger philosophical position, namely the ontological oneness of poetry and film.|$|E

He offers to help Arthur fight a mysterious sprite (controlled by the magician, King Cornwall) which has entered his chamber.

The Green Knight eventually gains so much control over the sprite through this text that he convinces it to take a sword and strike off its master's head.|$|E

5|$|Purcell {{did not set}} any of Shakespeare's <b>text</b> <b>to</b> music; {{instead he}} {{composed}} music for short masques in every act but the first. The play itself was also slightly modernised in keeping with seventeenth-century dramatic conventions, but in the main the spoken text is as Shakespeare wrote it. The masques {{are related to the}} play metaphorically, rather than literally. Many critics have stated that they bear no relationship to the play. Recent scholarship has shown that the opera, which ends with a masque featuring Hymen, the God of Marriage, was composed for the fifteenth wedding anniversary of William III and Mary II.|$|E
5|$|Ram Shankar Bhattacharya, an Indologist, dates the Pune {{version of}} a {{manuscript}} of the <b>text</b> <b>to</b> about the 13th or 14th century CE, and notes that {{this version of the}} Yoga Yajnavalkya quotes verses from Hatha Yoga texts. He also points out that Gargi is mentioned as the wife of Yajnavalkya in the manuscript. However, no other text affirms that Gargi was the wife of Yajnavalkya; rather, Maitreyi and Katyayani are listed as his two wives, leading to the theory that the Pune manuscript is a corrupted and more modern edition of the original text.|$|E

Part five offers an interview with Chomsky undertaken at the University of Maryland, while the book is rounded off by Chomsky's tribute to the late activist Howard Zinn and the National Lawyers Guild's legal advice to Occupy protesters.|$|E

Other reviews merely analyzed the decision and how it affected government-tribe trust cases. Alex Tallchief Skibine opined that the case was almost unique, and he did not foresee that it would be significant for other tribes.|$|E
