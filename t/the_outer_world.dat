The sequence establishes the protagonist as an introvert, {{a man who}} mediates his experience of the world through deliberation, and positions the film's subjective perspective through his narrative eyes. Charalampos Goyios argued that this hero, as an opera lover, maintains a sense of distance from <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>world</b> and that ramifications therein {{pale in comparison to}} the purity of interior experience.|$|E

If the spontaneous activity in the brain is not counterbalanced with information from the senses, loss from reality and psychosis may occur after some hours. A similar phenomenon is paranoia in the elderly, when poor eyesight, hearing and memory make the person abnormally suspicious of the environment.|$|E
25|$|To {{believe in}} God means to accept {{life on the}} {{assumption}} that it harbors conditions in <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>world</b> and drives in the human spirit which together impel man to transcend himself. To believe in God means to take for granted that it is man's destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society. In brief, God is the Power in the cosmos that gives human life the direction that enables the human being to reflect the image of God.|$|E

25|$|The {{human brain}} {{perceives}} {{the external world}} through the senses, and each individual human is influenced greatly {{by his or her}} experiences, leading to subjective views of existence and the passage of time. Humans are variously said to possess consciousness, self-awareness, and a mind, which correspond roughly to the mental processes of thought. These are said to possess qualities such as self-awareness, sentience, sapience, and the ability to perceive the relationship between oneself and one's environment. The extent to which the mind constructs or experiences <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>world</b> is a matter of debate, as are the definitions and validity of many of the terms used above.|$|E

Attention has frequently been drawn to the resemblances in manner and even in some points of detail between the chants of the muezzin and of the reader of the Qur'an with much of the hazzanut, not alone of the Sephardim, who passed so many centuries in Arab lands, but also of the Ashkenazim, equally long located far away in northern Europe.|$|E
25|$|Max Heindel {{divided the}} subtle body into: Vital Body made of Ether, our {{instrument}} for specializing the vital {{energy of the}} sun, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about {{an inch and a}} half outside the body; the Desire body, which is our emotional nature and pervades both the vital and dense bodies, seen by clairvoyant vision to extend about 16inches outside our visible body, related to the Desire World; and the Mental body, which functions like a mirror, reflects <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>world</b> and enables the Ego to transmit its commands as thought, word and action. The human being is seen as a threefold Spirit, possessing a Mind by which he governs the threefold Body that he transmutes into a threefold Soul. The Human Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the desire body to be transmuted into the Emotional Soul; the Life Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the vital body to be transmuted into the Intellectual Soul; the Divine Spirit aspect has emanated from itself the dense body to be transmuted into the Conscious Soul.|$|E

500|$|Several {{academic}} {{commentators have}} highlighted {{the existence of}} a position within the ONA called an [...] "Outer Representative", who serves as an official spokesperson for the group to <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>world.</b> The first to publicly claim to be the group's [...] "Outer Representative" [...] was Richard Moult, an artist and composer from Shropshire who used the pseudonym of [...] "Christos Beest". Moult was followed as [...] "Outer Representative" [...] by [...] "Vilnius Thornian", who held the position from 1996 to 2002, and who has been identified by ONA insiders as the Left Hand Path ideologue Michael Ford. Subsequently, on the blog of the White Star Acception, the claim was made that the group's member Chloe Ortega was the ONA's Outer Representative, also this blog later became defunct by 2013.

500|$|A second {{influence}} on Durkheim's view of society beyond Comte's positivism was the epistemological outlook called social realism. Although he never explicitly exposed it, Durkheim adopted a realist perspective {{in order to}} demonstrate the existence of social realities outside the individual and to show that these realities existed {{in the form of}} the objective relations of society. As an epistemology of science, realism can be defined as a perspective that takes as its central point of departure the view that external social realities exist in <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>world</b> and that these realities are independent of the individual's perception of them. This view opposes other predominant philosophical perspectives such as empiricism and positivism. Empiricists such as David Hume had argued that all realities in the outside world are products of human sense perception. According to empiricists, all realities are thus merely perceived: they do not exist independently of our perceptions, and have no causal power in themselves. Comte's positivism went a step further by claiming that scientific laws could be deduced from empirical observations. Going beyond this, Durkheim claimed that sociology would not only discover [...] "apparent" [...] laws, but would be able to discover the inherent nature of society.|$|E

Just a trifle less than seventy-two hours after our departure into the sands of the Sahara, we broke through the surface of Pellucidar.|$|R
50|$|Jon Serl {{painted in}} oil paint on a found surface. He mainly painted {{characters}} that {{were known to}} be expressionistic and complex, but also brash and bold. It was part of his trademark, which also included the long elegant arms, clownish expressions and large eyes. Because of his vaudeville childhood, his canvases were often compared to theatrical stages. His works explored the inner and <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>worlds</b> with a strange narrative, which usually expressed dualities such as: female against male, good against evil, or nature against technology.|$|R

2500|$|For a {{long time}} the Sephardim took {{an active part in}} Spanish literature; they wrote in prose and in rhyme, and were the authors of theological, philosophical, [...] (aesthetic rather than content based writing), pedagogic (teaching), and {{mathematical}} works. The rabbis, who, in common with all the Sephardim, emphasized a pure and euphonious pronunciation of Hebrew, delivered their sermons in Spanish or in Portuguese. Several of these sermons have appeared in print. Their thirst for knowledge, together with the fact that they associated freely with <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>world,</b> led the Sephardim to establish new educational systems. Wherever they settled, they founded schools that used Spanish as the medium of instruction.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the heart}} of Strauss & Howe's ideas is a basic {{alternation}} between {{two different types of}} eras, Crises and Awakenings. Both of these are defining eras in which people observe that historic events are radically altering their social environment. Crises are periods marked by major secular upheaval, when society focuses on reorganizing <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>world</b> of institutions and public behavior (they say the last American Crisis was the period spanning the Great Depression and World War II). Awakenings are periods marked by cultural or religious renewal, when society focuses on changing the inner world of values and private behavior (the last American Awakening was the [...] "Consciousness Revolution" [...] of the 1960s and 1970s).|$|E

According to the game, after winning the war with the aliens, the Confederation did not relinquish its naval power and began exploiting the resources of <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>worlds.</b> Those worlds eventually seceded, provoking a civil war. The Rebellion is in turn criticized for its aggressive nature, support of quasi-criminal organizations, and attacks on civilian shipping and liners. The Rebellion uses four ships in their campaign against the Confederation, namely the Manta, the Rebel Destroyer, the Rebel Cruiser and the Escort Carrier, the last of which is seen only when the player is working for the Confederation.|$|R
2500|$|Withdrawal or {{detachment}} from <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>world</b> is a characteristic feature of schizoid pathology, but may appear either in [...] "classic" [...] or in [...] "secret" [...] form. When classic, it matches the typical {{description of the}} schizoid personality offered in the DSM-5. It is however [...] "just as often" [...] a hidden internal state: that which meets the objective eye may not match the subjective, internal world of the patient. Klein therefore cautions that one should not miss identifying the schizoid patient because one cannot see the patient's withdrawal through the patient's defensive, compensatory interaction with external reality. He suggests that one need only ask the patient what his or her subjective experience is in order to detect {{the presence of the}} schizoid refusal of emotional intimacy.|$|E
2500|$|The ancient {{philosophy}} {{and practices of}} the Greeks, thereafter Romans, were imbued with polytheistic idolatry. They debate what is an image and if the use of image is appropriate. To Plato, images can be a remedy or poison to the human experience. To Aristotle, states Paul Kugler, an image is an appropriate mental intermediary that [...] "bridges between the inner world {{of the mind and}} <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>world</b> of material reality", the image is a vehicle between sensation and reason. Idols are useful psychological catalysts, they reflect sense data and pre-existing inner feelings. They are neither the origins nor the destinations of thought but the intermediary in the human inner journey. Fervid opposition to the idolatry of the Greeks and Romans was of Early Christianity and later Islam, as evidenced by the widespread desecration and defacement of ancient Greek and Roman sculptures that have survived into the modern era.|$|E
2500|$|The second path, that {{of dynamic}} psychiatry, began in 1924 with {{observations}} by Eugen Bleuler, who {{observed that the}} schizoid person and schizoid pathology were not things to be set apart. [...] Ronald Fairbairn's seminal work on the schizoid personality, from which most {{of what is known}} today about schizoid phenomena is derived, was presented in 1940. Here Fairbairn delineated four central schizoid themes: (1) the need to regulate interpersonal distance as a central focus of concern, (2) the ability to mobilize self preservative defenses and self-reliance, (3) a pervasive tension between the anxiety-laden need for attachment and the defensive need for distance that manifests in observable behavior as indifference, and (4) an overvaluation of the inner world at the expense of <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> <b>world.</b> Following Fairbairn, the dynamic psychiatry tradition has continued to produce rich explorations on the schizoid character, most notably from writers Nannarello (1953), Laing (1965), Winnicott (1965), Guntrip (1969), Khan (1974), Akhtar (1987), Seinfeld (1991), Manfield (1992) and Klein (1995).|$|E
