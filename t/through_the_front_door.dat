While Leaf is able to pass <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and return to Earth, {{the presence of a}} Nithling duplicate of Arthur prevents him from doing so, and he is forced to remain in the Lower House.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{they play}} their {{favorite}} game, Eels and Escalators. Patrick always gets escalators but SpongeBob always gets eels. Eventually, he loses {{the game and}} accidentally utters the swear word. Patrick then races to the Krusty Krab to tell Mr. Krabs with SpongeBob trying to stop him, inadvertently getting Patrick to say the word in the process. When SpongeBob bursts <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and tells Mr. Krabs that Patrick said the swear word, Patrick then joins along. Eventually, Mr. Krabs stops their gibberish explanations, and takes SpongeBob and Patrick outside and makes them paint the Krusty Krab as punishment.|$|E

They entered it <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of the sheriff's office. Payne, the jailer, said he had left it {{unlocked}} to let in a detective from McAlester, who was looking for an escaped prisoner. He said the men bound, gagged and blindfolded him at gunpoint, took his keys, and cut the telephone line. He was unable to identify them.|$|E

25|$|As February 2008, 98 B-Line route {{passengers}} with valid {{proof of}} payment were permitted to board using {{any of the three}} doors at any stop. To facilitate this, the bus driver controlled the operation of all three doors at each of the stops. Passengers paying cash or validating FareSavers had to board <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1774, when Squire fled a ransacked house, he ran {{straight}} into {{several members of}} the local constabulary and was arrested for highway robbery. This was actually a lucky break. By escaping <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> which opened onto the highway, he avoided a more serious charge of stealing. Although Squire was sentenced to be transported to America for 7 years, he elected to serve in the army and returned to Kingston as a free man within 4 years.|$|E

50|$|If the matador {{makes a good}} kill, {{the public}} asks the {{president}} of the ring to reward the matador by waving bandanas or small fans. The reward is cutting the ears and/or tail of the bull; earning the tail is more prestigious than earning the ears. A higher reward is that of exiting the plaza de toros (bullring) <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors,</b> which are called puertas grandes.|$|R
5000|$|... "Blobfest"is {{an annual}} 3-day event each summer, started in 1999, held in {{downtown}} Phoenixville that features multiple screenings of The Blob and other horror films.

25|$|Along {{with the}} hastily built wooden {{factories}} constructed by Ybor and Haya, {{some of the}} first structures in Ybor City were 50 small houses (‘’casitas’’) for prospective employees. These narrow shotgun-style homes (so called because a shot fired <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> would theoretically exit harmlessly out of the aligned back door) were small wooden structures, but they were well-built and relatively comfortable. Ybor offered them for sale at a price just above his cost to build them (initially $400), payable in small deductions from the workers’ salary in his cigar factory.|$|E
25|$|The MBTA's {{solution}} was to turn the surface portion of the Green Line into a proof-of-payment system {{to increase the efficiency}} of boarding at peak times on surface Green Line stops. All doors on all trolleys open at some or all stations, depending on the branch. Passengers can pay their fare in several ways, depending on their payment method. Passengers paying with cash must enter <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and pay at the farebox, where they may receive a proof-of-payment receipt. Stored-value CharlieCard or CharlieTicket holders may also need to pay at the farebox.|$|E
25|$|The closing {{sequence}} for {{the first}} season featured a simple, dark background as the credits rolled. In the second season, Wally and Beaver are seen walking home from school with their schoolbooks and entering the house <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> In the third through fifth seasons, Wally and Beaver are seen walking towards the Pine Street house. Beaver carries a baseball glove and limps along the curbstone.

25|$|Adair {{also sought}} {{to work closely with}} Belfast-based dissidents such as Frankie Curry and Jackie Mahood, {{provoking}} further anger from the UVF. Another loyalist feud erupted, and ended with several men dead and scores evicted from their homes. The Rathcoole home of long-standing UDA member Sammy Duddy was raked by gunfire; although Duddy was not injured in the shooting attack, his pet chihuahua Bambi was fatally wounded by shots fired <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> by masked gunmen from Adair's C Company. Adair later admitted in an interview he gave for journalist Suzanne Breen that Duddy never got over the loss of Bambi.|$|E
25|$|Wong entered <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> {{firing a}} number of bullets at people in his path. At 10:30a.m. Broome County Communications {{received}} several 911 calls, and the first police were dispatched to the scene. Two of the Civic Association's receptionists {{were among the first}} victims shot. While one of the receptionists was reported to have been shot through the head and killed, the second, shot in the stomach, feigned death and, when the gunman moved on, took cover under a desk and called 911. The receptionist's call was taken by 911 staff at 10:38a.m. The wounded receptionist, 61-year-old Shirley DeLucia, remained on the line for 39 minutes, despite her gunshot wound, and relayed information until she was rescued. She later recounted that the gunman had opened fire without saying anything.|$|E
25|$|According to {{accounts}} of the following event reported by Glenn Boyer in I Married Wyatt Earp, Earp had run two cowboys, Tobe Driscall and Ed Morrison, out of Wichita earlier in 1878. During the summer, the two cowboys—accompanied by another two dozen men—rode into Dodge and shot up the town while galloping down Front Street. They entered the Long Branch Saloon, vandalized the room, and harassed the customers. Hearing the commotion, Earp burst <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> and before he could react, {{a large number of}} cowboys were pointing their guns at him. In another version, there were only three to five cowboys. In both stories, Holliday was playing cards {{in the back of the}} room and upon seeing the commotion, drew his weapon and put his pistol at Morrison's head, forcing him and his men to disarm, rescuing Earp from a bad situation. No account of any such confrontation was reported by any of the Dodge City newspapers at the time. Whatever actually happened, Earp credited Holliday with saving his life that day, and the two men became friends.|$|E
50|$|The Grantura {{bodyshell}} {{was made}} from glass-reinforced plastic and made use {{of a variety of}} proprietary components. <b>The</b> bonnet was <b>front</b> hinged. There was no opening at the rear but the boot could be accessed from inside the car - the spare wheel had to be removed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors.</b> Buyers could choose from a range of powerplants which included a choice of side or overhead valve engines from Ford, a Coventry Climax unit or the MGA B-series engine.|$|R
50|$|Some {{residents}} praise Pusser as {{an honest}} cop in a crooked town; others denounce {{him as a}} bully willing to break some laws to uphold others. Pusser is attacked several times, and finally he and Pauline are ambushed in their car. Pauline is killed and Pusser is seriously injured. He is {{admitted to the hospital}} after being shot and while still in a neck and face cast, attends his wife's funeral. Afterward he rams a sheriff cruiser <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> of <b>the</b> Lucky Spot, killing two of his would-be assassins.|$|R

25|$|In April 2000 (See: Death of John Carthy), the ERU {{was brought}} into the public {{spotlight}} after killing a 27-year-old man with a known mental disorder in controversial circumstances, following a 25-hour barricaded siege in Abbeylara, County Longford. John Carthy fired up to 7 shots from a legally held double-barreled shotgun, both at unarmed and armed Gardaí after a dispute with his family (he held no hostages). An ERU tactical team arrived from Dublin and {{took charge of the}} incident and attempted to negotiate with Carthy, but he repelled their attempts. After 25 hours, he exited his house <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> with a loaded shotgun in his hands. He was repeatedly ordered at gunpoint to drop his weapon, but refused, and advanced towards the perimeter. Upon exiting his premises and walking towards the local town, he was shot four times by two ERU snipers (who fired two shots each) and died. No-one else sustained injuries, although a police car was damaged by Carthy. The resulting Barr Tribunal was critical of the Gardaí, suggesting Carthy's life could have been preserved, however it found that the ERU team had acted within the law. The incident brought a number of changes in procedures when dealing with barricade incidents.|$|E
500|$|Wyatt {{told the}} court {{afterward}} that Ike Clanton had bragged that he would kill the Earps or Doc Holliday at his first opportunity, but when the gunfight broke out, Clanton ran forward and grabbed him, exclaiming that he was unarmed {{and did not want}} a fight. To this protest Wyatt said he responded, [...] "Go to fighting or get away!" [...] Clanton ran <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> of Fly's boarding house and escaped, unwounded. Other accounts say that Ike drew a hidden pistol and fired at the Earps before disappearing. Billy Claiborne also ran from the fight.|$|E
500|$|In the episode's DVD commentary, MacFarlane {{addressed}} what viewers {{perceived to}} be a rather abrupt ending to the episode. As Peter has lost all hope in getting custody of his kids back, Lois walks <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> returning from the hospital, and has brought the kids home with her. MacFarlane stated, [...] "Some of the fans actually noticed, commented {{on the fact that}} this was a very abrupt resolution, but, to that I would say, you're not watching [...] wouldn't you rather we throw in more jokes and fill up the time, and then hustle to the finish line at the last minute?".|$|E
50|$|Open Door Ceremony: This {{tradition}} {{started in}} 1923 during {{the presidency of}} William F. Curtis. While the actual process changes slightly each year, the sentiment of this tradition - that Cedar Crest welcomes students through its doors with open arms - remains the same. New students exit <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> of Blaney Hall and announce their names and hometowns to the college community. As they descend the steps, the students are given welcome gifts from the Student Affairs staff and the Alumnae Association, and add their name to the registry of students who came before them.|$|R

50|$|This {{design was}} {{distinguished}} from other streetcars {{of the era}} by its use of the center door as an exit only, with a conductor stationed inside just in <b>front</b> of <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Passengers could board <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>doors</b> without waiting or paying; they could pay the conductor immediately {{and sit in the}} rear of the car (in the nicer seats), or wait in front and pay just before they exit. This had the effect of reducing the car's dwell time at stops, improving schedule times and increasing capacity. Many vehicles were later converted to pay-as-you-enter operation in order to reduce the number of staff needed, but they continued to be known as Peter Witt cars.|$|R
500|$|Armed with a CZ 75B {{semi-automatic}} pistol, {{which is}} {{manufactured in the}} town, and an Alfa 820 revolver, [...] opened fire without any warning immediately after entering the restaurant, shooting his victims directly in the head. Eight died immediately or soon afterwards. One female victim, who was shot twice in the chest, managed to leave the restaurant, while Gabriel remained hidden in the restaurant's bathroom. Eight other people escaped the building through the back door. Another customer, , who took cover under a table, used a moment in which [...] was reloading, and threw a chair at him, hitting him on the neck. This gave him an opportunity to run out <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> with two other people.|$|E
500|$|Marshall {{discovered}} other {{building and}} vehicle remains that became debris missiles, including a twisted [...] steel beam, a steel leg broken {{off of a}} lawn chair that was impaled into a [...] post by the violent winds and a [...] section of a sewer pipe that was blown into the interior hallway of one house <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> The team's findings also revealed that several homes were obliterated before they experienced {{the full impact of}} the vortex's peak wind velocities, with some disintegrating as the external winds surrounding the parent tornado reached speeds of F2 intensity. Three months later, as homes were being built in the damage path, Marshall found their construction to be scarcely superior to that of the homes destroyed in the May 3 storm.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons {{fly through}} a tipping metal water tower and Bob cuts {{a big hole}} into Hell. Maggie, now giant-sized after {{entering}} the reactor room during Pre-show 2, appears and grabs Bob and slams him into the vehicle, which almost plummets into Hell before it is saved by Professor Frink. Bob then steals Maggie's pacifier and tells her that she must destroy Springfield to get it back. Riders then take a ride through Springfield with references to the original opening sequence before encountering Maggie again, who mistakes their car for a new pacifier, and sucks on them repeatedly, before spitting them out (getting riders wet), onto overhead power lines and catapulting them into the Simpsons' house by crashing right <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> While Maggie is sucking on the riders, the aroma of baby powder is released.|$|E
5000|$|The 1998 {{memorial}} for the 1973 UpStairs Lounge arson {{attack and}} fire {{proved to be}} a turning point for the modern LGBTQ modern rights movement in New Orleans when mourners refused to avoid TV cameras and media awaiting outside the service.
