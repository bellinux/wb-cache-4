In January 1957, Häyhänen received a message from Moscow promoting him to Lieutenant Colonel and granting him leave in the Soviet Union. Upon hearing he was due to return to Moscow, Häyhänen was fearful {{that he would be}} severely disciplined or even executed. Häyhänen fabricated stories to justify his delay, claiming to Fisher that the FBI had taken him off the RMS Queen Mary. Fisher, unsuspecting, advised Häyhänen to leave the U.S. immediately to avoid FBI surveillance and handed him <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> for travel expenses. Prior to his departure, Häyhänen returned to Bear Mountain Park and retrieved the buried five thousand dollars for his own use.

Cardinal Cappellari, afterwards Pope Gregory XVI, donated <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars.</b> The Russian ambassador to the United States loaned him $5,000, and then used the promissory note to light his cigar. Later, when Gallitzin was suggested for the see of Philadelphia in 1814, Bishop Carroll objected.

[...] In 1815, Gallitzin was suggested for the bishopric of Bardstown, Kentucky, and in 1827 for the proposed see of Pittsburgh.

If the evidence went as far toward establishing a guilty profit of one or two hundred thousand dollars, as it does of one or <b>two</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars,</b> the case would, on the question of guilt, bear a far different aspect. That on this contract, involving from one million to twelve hundred thousand dollars, the contractors should attempt a fraud which at the most could profit them only one or two hundred, or even one thousand dollars, is to my mind beyond the power of rational belief. That they did not, in such a case, strike for greater gains proves that they did not, with guilty or fraudulent intent, strike at all. The judgment and sentence are disapproved and declared null, and the accused ordered to be discharged." ...|$|E
