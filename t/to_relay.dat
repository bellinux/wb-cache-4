5|$|KAL007's {{divergence}} {{prevented the}} aircraft from transmitting its position via shorter range {{very high frequency}} radio (VHF). It therefore requested KAL015, also en route to Seoul, <b>to</b> <b>relay</b> reports to air traffic control on its behalf. KAL007 requested KAL015 <b>to</b> <b>relay</b> its position three times. At 14:43UTC, KAL007 directly transmitted a change of {{estimated time of arrival}} for its next waypoint, NEEVA, to the international flight service station at Anchorage, but it did so over the longer range high frequency radio (HF) rather than VHF. HF transmissions are able to carry a longer distance than VHF, but are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference and static; VHF is clearer with less interference, and preferred by flight crews. The inability to establish direct radio communications to be able to transmit their position directly did not alert the pilots of KAL007 of their ever-increasing divergence and was not considered unusual by air traffic controllers. Halfway between Bethel and waypoint NABIE, KAL007 passed through the southern portion of the North American Aerospace Defense Command buffer zone. This zone is north of Romeo 20 and off-limits to civilian aircraft.|$|E

5|$|A {{communications}} variant designated Tu-142MR ("Bear J") was {{the last}} production version of the Tu-142. It was tasked with long-range communications duties with Soviet ballistic missile submarines, a role {{similar to that of}} the Boeing E-6 Mercury. The Tu-142MR differed from the ASW Tu-142s in having less-sophisticated avionics, but had a long trailing wire radio aerial <b>to</b> <b>relay</b> messages to submerged Soviet submarines in times of nuclear war. This was amongst the many distinctive features of the Tu-142MR that allows it to communicate with satellites, airborne and ground-based command posts, and submarines. The aircraft replaced the Ilyushin Il-80 in the airborne command and control role. Tu-142s are currently operated by the 76th Naval Aviation Regiment from Kipelovo. Other developments of the Tu-142 include the one-off Tu-142MRT maritime reconnaissance variant, and the unbuilt Tu-142MS missile-carrying variant.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Tor {{anonymity}} network {{depends on}} volunteers <b>to</b> oper-ate <b>relays,</b> and might offer higher bandwidth with lower response laten-cies if more users could be incentivized <b>to</b> contribute <b>relay</b> bandwidth. We introduce TEARS, a system rewarding useful service with traffic prior-ity. TEARS audits relays and rewards them with anonymous coins called Shallots, proportionally to bandwidth contributed. Shallots may be re-deemed anonymously for PriorityPasses, {{which in turn}} may be presented <b>to</b> <b>relays</b> <b>to</b> request traffic priority. The PriorityPass construction enables <b>relays</b> <b>to</b> prevent double spending locally without leaking information. Unlike previous incentive proposals, TEARS incorporates transparent and distributed banking using protocols from distributed digital cryp-tocurrency systems like Bitcoin. Shallots are publicly-verifiable, minimiz-ing reliance on and trust in banking authorities, making them auditable while naturally distributing bank functionality and associated overhead. Further, these distributed banking protocols resist denial-of-service at-tacks and can recover from catastrophic failures. TEARS may either be deployed in the existing Tor network or operate alongside it. ...|$|R
