40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{clinical}} presentation, treatment and outcome of tetanus in a European population. DESIGN: A retrospective study. SETTING: A large university {{hospital with a}} regional {{as well as a}} referral service. SUBJECTS: All patients with tetanus from 1983 till 1993. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients (13 men, 14 women; mean age 68. 5 years) were studied. Seventeen out of 24 wounds (three patients had no history of a recent wound) were described as <b>tetanus-prone.</b> Ten patients had medical wound care, but none received tetanus immunoglobulins despite the absence of tetanus immunity. All patients had the generalized type of the disease. The classical symptoms of trismus, dysphagia and muscular rigidity were present in all patients. Treatment consisted of wound management, neutralization of tetanus toxin by immunoglobulins, antibiotics, treatment of muscle spasm and instability of the autonomic nervous system, and supportive care. Twenty-five patients were admitted to the intensive care unit for a mean duration of 25. 7 days. Sixteen patients were artificially ventilated for a mean duration of 27. 5 days. Three patients died, 11 patients had a complicated course caused by haemodynamic instability and 15 patients had pulmonary complications. CONCLUSIONS: Tetanus has not vanished. It remains a difficult-to-treat disease with a substantial morbidity and mortality rate. Prevention during wound management of <b>tetanus-prone</b> wounds was inappropriate in many patients. The elderly population may have the highest risk for tetanus since they may not have had tetanus toxoid immunization or regular booster injections. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackgroundTétanos Quick Stick® (TQS) is a {{test for}} tetanus {{immunity}} screening for wounded patients in emergency departments (EDs), but represents additional costs compared with a medical interview on vaccination history. The study objective {{was to assess the}} effectiveness and cost of the TQS in French EDs. MethodsWe performed a model-based analysis that simulates screening of tetanus immunity and risk of tetanus based on prophylaxis administration. Strategies compared were: i) diagnosis of tetanus immunity by “TQS”; ii) “Medical Interview” (current practice). The study population was 1, 658, 000 French adults seeking ED care for a wound in 2012. Model parameters were estimated based on French national surveillance data, and published literature. Outcome measures were number of tetanus cases, life years gained and costs (2012 €) from a societal perspective. ResultsUse of TQS had negligible impact on health outcomes (0. 02 tetanus cases/year in France vs. 0. 41 for “Medical Interview”), but resulted in a decrease in annual costs of € 2, 203, 000 (− 42 %). Base case and sub-group analysis showed that with the same effectiveness, the average cost per patient was: € 13 with “Medical Interview” vs. € 11. 7 with TQS for the overall cohort; € 28. 9 with “Medical Interview” vs. € 21 with “TQS” for <b>tetanus-prone</b> wounds; € 15 with “Medical Interview” vs. € 14. 1 with “TQS” for patients aged ≥ 65 years; and € 6. 2 with “Medical Interview” vs. € 7. 8 with “TQS” for non-tetanus-prone wounds. ConclusionsUse of TQS is as effective and less costly than “Medical Interview” when applied in ED to wounded patients with <b>tetanus-prone</b> wounds or aged ≥ 65 years. However, it is more expensive in patients with non-tetanus-prone wounds...|$|E
40|$|Tetanus {{is a life}} {{threatening}} non-communicable infection caused by the anaerobic bacillus tetanus clostridium which enters the body through a wound. The World Health Organisation (2006) aim to eradicate tetanus incidence globally {{is supported by the}} implementation of national vaccination programmes. The United Kingdom population receive tetanus prophylaxis through a robust vaccination infrastructure and unscheduled tetanus prophylaxis when patients present to emergency departments following penetrating injury. However, individual patient recall of tetanus immune status is problematic. The decision to prescribe tetanus prophylaxis is dependent on accurate assessment of a <b>tetanus-prone</b> wound and current tetanus immunity status so one solution is the use of tetanus immunoassay. This paper presents an analysis of expenditure on unscheduled tetanus prophylaxis in two emergency departments at one NHS Foundation Trust in the North of England. Consideration is given to potential benefits of single step point-of-care tetanus immunoassay using one drop of the patient???s blood. Cost-savings were limited however critical to the discussion is the impact of tetanus immunoassay on patient choice. Any prospective change to an A&E departments??? tetanus prophylaxis practise must guarantee no less a level of seroprotection than necessary and preferably should enhance individual patients??? safety, comfort and choice...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{assess the}} {{knowledge}} and current tetanus prevention practices of various staff members in accident and emergency (A&E) departments. Design, setting and participants: A structured questionnaire containing 16 questions on tetanus guidance, anti-tetanus practice, vaccination preparations and information on the population served by the department was sent to medical and nursing staff in A&E departments across England. Results: 366 completed questionnaires from 67 hospitals were returned. 48. 9 % of the questionnaires were completed by the medical staff and 39. 9 % by the nursing staff at various grades. 75 % of respondents said that their department had a local tetanus guideline, but only 29 % stated that the tetanus guidelines were always followed. 31. 4 % of respondents said that injecting drug users were managed as a high-risk group in their department. Many respondents did not follow the national policy; they tended {{to err on the}} side of caution when it came to defining and treating <b>tetanus-prone</b> wounds, with 22. 1 % stating that they would consider any wound tetanus prone. Contrary to current Department of Health guidelines, 46. 2 % of respondents said that they would give a booster dose if the fifth dose had been given. 10 years ago. Conclusions: There are clear differences between the recommended guidelines for tetanus prevention and current practice in A&E departments. The changes announced in 2002 do not seem to have been widel...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{choice of}} tetanus {{prophylaxis}} {{for patients with}} wounds depends on obtaining their vaccination history, which has been demonstrated to be unreliable. Use of a rapid immunoassay (Tétanos Quick Stick, the TQS), combined with knowledge of certain demographic characteristics, may improve the evaluation of tetanus immunity and thus help to avoid inadequate prophylactic measures and reduce costs. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate {{the contribution of the}} TQS in the choice of tetanus prophylaxis and to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis. The final aim was to define the place of the TQS in a modified algorithm for assessment of tetanus immunity in the emergency department. METHOD: In this Belgian prospective, double-blind, multicentre study, 611 adult patients with a wound were included; 498 (81. 5 %) records were valid. The TQS test was performed by a nurse before the vaccination history was taken and the choice of prophylaxis was made, using the official algorithm (Belgian Superior Health Council), by a doctor who was unaware of the TQS result. RESULTS: The prevalence of protective anti-tetanus immunity was 74. 1 %. Immunity was lower in older patients and in female patients. The TQS was a cost-effective tool for patients presenting with a <b>tetanus-prone</b> wound and considered from the vaccination history to be unprotected. Use of the TQS would have improved management in 56. 9 % (95 % CI 47. 7 % to 65. 7 %) of patients by avoiding unnecessary treatments, leading to a reduction in the mean cost per patient (10. 58 euros/patient with the TQS versus 11. 34 euros/patient without). The benefits of the TQS use were significantly greater in patients < 61 years old: unnecessary treatment would have been avoided in 76. 9 % (95 % CI 65. 8 % to 85. 4 %) of cases and the mean cost per patient reduced to 8. 31 euros. CONCLUSION: In selected patients, the TQS is a cost-effective tool to evaluate tetanus immunity. An algorithm is proposed for ED assessment of tetanus immunity integrating age and the TQS result.

40|$|Tetanus is {{an acute}} disease {{caused by the}} action of tetanus toxin, {{released}} following infection by the bacterium Clostridium tetani. Tetanus spores are present in soil or manure and may be introduced into the body through a puncture wound, burn or scratch – which may go unnoticed. Neonatal tetanus is due to infection of the baby’s umbilical stump. The bacteria grow anaerobically {{at the site of the}} injury and have an incubation period of between four and 21 days (most commonly about ten days). The disease is characterised by generalised rigidity and spasms of skeletal muscles. The muscle stiffness usually involves the jaw (lockjaw) and neck and then becomes generalised. The case–fatality ratio ranges from 10 to 90 %; it is highest in infants and the elderly. It varies inversely with the length of the incubation period and the availability of intensive care. Tetanus can never be eradicated because the spores are commonly present in the environment, including soil. Tetanus is not spread from person to person. History and epidemiology of the disease Tetanus immunisation was first provided in the UK to the Armed Forces in 1938. From the mid- 1950 s it was introduced in some localities as part of the primary immunisation of infants, then nationally in 1961. The disease had almost disappeared in children under 15 years of age by the 1970 s (Galbraith et al., 1981). In 1970, it was recommended that people with <b>tetanus-prone</b> wounds should routinely be offered passive immunisation and complete a primary immunisation course. Between 1984 and 2004, there were 198 cases of tetanus (combined data from notifications, deaths and laboratory reports) in England and Wales (Rushdy et al., 2003). Seventy-four per cent occurred in individuals aged 45 years or over, and 16 % were in individuals aged from 25 to 44 years. The highest incidence of tetanus was in adults over 65 years of age, with no cases of tetanus reported in infants or children under five years of age. Three cases were notified in Northern Ireland between 1984 and 2002. Twenty cases of tetanus were reported in injecting drug users (IDUs) betwee...|$|E
40|$|In a monocentric, double-blind, {{randomized}} trial, {{we examined}} the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of a new, pasteurized, human tetanus immunoglobulin (P-HTIG). As part of the purification process, P-HTIG has undergone a heat treatment step (10 h at 60 °C) {{and the removal of}} Merthiolate. Forty-eight adults with a history of tetanus vaccination were randomized into four groups (n = 12 per group) to receive one of two different batches of this P-HTIG simultaneously with either tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine (sham, postexposure prophylaxis of tetanus) or placebo. Local reactions at the injection site were followed for the first 3 days after injection, and systemic reactions were followed during the entire study period, i. e., up to 42 days posttreatment. Blood samples for tetanus antibody titer determination (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method) were drawn prior to treatment on day 0 and on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42. A normalization of tetanus antibody titers (subtraction of the day 0 value for each subject at each time period) was performed to assess the additive effect of P-HTIG on tetanus antibody titers. The pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by both a compartmental analysis (modelization) and a noncompartmental analysis. No severe adverse reactions were reported. The rate of local reactions at the P-HTIG injection site was 27 %. All local reactions were mild and resolved within 2 days. In contrast, local reactions at the vaccine injection site were seen in 79 % of the subjects. The rate of systemic reactions was similar in the P-HTIG plus Td vaccine group (33 %) and in the P-HTIG plus placebo group (21 %), and all these reactions were mild. In the P-HTIG plus placebo group, tetanus antibody titers rose to a maximum of 0. 313 ± 2. 49 IU/ml after 4. 4 days; in the P-HTIG plus Td vaccine group, a maximum concentration of 15. 2 ± 2. 42 IU/ml was reached 19 days postinjection. In both groups, 100 % of the patients had seroprotective levels of tetanus antibodies (≥ 0. 01 IU/ml) 2 days following treatment. An anamnestic response to Td vaccine appeared 7 days postimmunization. In conclusion, P-HTIG has a good safety and pharmacokinetic profile. Our results confirm that immunoglobulin should be associated with vaccine in the treatment of <b>tetanus-prone</b> wounds...|$|E
