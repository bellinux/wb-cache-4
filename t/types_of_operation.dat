500|$|The Raid on Dunkirk of 7 July 1800 was {{an attack}} by a British Royal Navy force on the well-defended French {{anchorage}} of Dunkirk in the English Channel during the French Revolutionary Wars. French naval forces had been blockaded in their harbours during the conflict, and often the only method of attacking them was through fireships or [...] "cutting-out" [...] expeditions, in which boats would carry boarding parties into the harbour at night, seize ships at anchor and bring them out. The attack on Dunkirk {{was a combination of}} both of these <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> aimed at a powerful French frigate squadron at anchor in Dunkirk harbour.

The transport of data often involves the coordinated execution of the specified remote operations, and thus the operations can be viewed as extensions to standard data transport.

5000|$|Planning {{permission}} in the United Kingdom {{refers to}} the planning permission required in the United Kingdom and Ireland {{in order to be}} allowed to build on land, or change the use of land or buildings. Within the UK the occupier of any land or building will need title to that land or building (i.e. [...] "ownership"), but will also need [...] "planning title" [...] or planning permission. Planning title was granted for all pre-existing uses and buildings by the Town and Country Planning Act 1947, which came into effect on 1 July 1948. Since that date any new [...] "development" [...] has required planning permission. [...] "Development" [...] as defined by law consists of any building, engineering or mining operation, or the making of a material change of use in any land or building. Certain <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> such as routine maintenance of an existing building are specifically excluded from the definition of development. Specified categories of minor or insignificant development are granted an automatic planning permission by law, and therefore do not require any application for planning permission. These categories are referred to as permitted development.|$|E
