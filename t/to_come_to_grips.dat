5|$|After lunch, Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> with the bowling. Yardley took the new ball {{in an attempt}} to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more quickly. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked {{to the edge of the}} playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester’s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped to swing the match back from England's firm control.|$|E

50|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, Toni Morrison’s Beloved {{remains an}} important milestone for Afrosurrealists. Here, Morrison imagines {{a narrative of}} a slave women grieving {{the death of her}} baby daughter, Beloved. With no trace of a past, Beloved reappears of on the steps of 124, confused and looking for her mother. Following this moment, the novel crafts a haunting tale of a woman seeking to understand the sudden reappearance of her daughter and the scars left behind from slavery. In Beloved, Morrison attempts <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> with the legacies left by slavery, challenging the notion that these legacies exits only from the past. From the epigraph, “Sixty Million and more,” Morrison presupposes {{there is no way to}} count those affected from slavery and additionally, that the number is ever-growing into the present.

25|$|The {{narrative}} use of fragmented {{sentences and}} stream of consciousness does {{not conform to}} the rules of traditional grammar or sentence structure.

The timing of the publication is significant: during the 1980s, Austria's younger generation was trying <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> with their country's Nazi past. The story of a February hidden in shadows—February Shadows—forces the readers, most of whom would be Austrians, to relieve the experience of that February and thus remember a past that most Austrians wanted to suppress. In this way, it is both a culturally revealing and politically charged story.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{infidelity}} are found acted out in television and film {{because of the}} drama often.

She never married again, or even held a serious relationship for long, during her time on the series and let her bitterness for Derek’s unfaithfulness be known. Another example is the film The Other Women. It is based off the unfaithfulness of one man to three different women. When the wife finds out about the affair she has a breakdown. She cries, she becomes helpless without the support of others and she drinks in attempts <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> with the infidelity.

25|$|The Russians met fierce {{resistance}} from Chechen rebel fighters intimately familiar with their capital city. The defenders {{had chosen to}} withstand the heavy Russian bombardment for the chance <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grips</b> with their enemy {{in an environment of}} their choosing, using interconnected firing positions and maneuver warfare. In stark contrast to the ad-hoc defense of 1994, the separatists prepared well for the Russian assault. Grozny was transformed into a fortress city under the leadership of field commander Aslambek Ismailov. The Chechens dug hundreds of trenches and antitank ditches, built bunkers behind apartment buildings, laid land mines throughout the city, placed sniper nests on high-rise buildings and prepared escape routes. In some instances whole buildings were booby-trapped; the ground floor windows and doors were usually boarded-up or mined, making it impossible for the Russians to simply walk into a building. Relying on their high mobility (they usually did not use body armor because of lack of equipment), the Chechens would use the trenches to move between houses and sniper positions, engaging the Russians as they focused on the tops of buildings or on windows. Well-organized small groups of no more than 15 fighters moved freely about Grozny using the city's sewer network, even sneaking behind Russian lines and attacking unsuspecting soldiers from the rear.|$|E

40|$|Since its {{establishment}} in the 1970 ies sociological network theory {{is concerned with}} boundaries. This mostly implicit concern comes quite naturally because {{the very concept of}} network allows to bracket the boundary problem (Wellman 1988) —only to make it even more salient. Thinking relationally means facing the problem how distinct identities, bound social entities or delimited domains emerge out of networks of relations that just don‘t lend easily to any concept of boundary (Emirbayer 1997). The salience of the problem notwithstanding boundaries remained only the hidden theoretical agenda of network research. But in the meantime the search for solutions has been reinforced (Abbott 1995; Eigmüller and Vobruba 2006; Lamont and Molnár 2002; Tilly 2005; Zerubavel 1991). In my presentation I will focus on some distinguished theoretical ideas and statements of a few relational thinkers <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>grip</b> with boundaries and their connection to networks. This connection might prove to be much closer than expected. To be able to distill the main theoretical ideas out of the body of literature I will basically use three restrictions that will guide the selection. This proceeding has two further effects. It serves to keep some of the preoccupations of social boundary research at bay which only distract us from the main subject, that is, boundaries. Additionally it serves as a discription of my own boundaries with respect to boundary research (a paltry excuse though). My first and main restriction is to pick up for discussion only propositions that focus on boundaries explicitly. This proves of value because sociological studies on boundaries are rather preoccupied with identity than with boundaries (cf. Tilly 2004 : 213 - 14). Without any doubt identity formation is very close to boundary setting so that any presumed identity can serve as an indicator of some boundary. Nevertheless identities and boundaries are different simply because one boundary can bring about at least two identities. (Besides, we wouldn‘t need two terms to indicate something that is identical.) The second restriction is to preclud...|$|R

50|$|The novel {{begins with}} an aged woman named Kanchan {{returning}} to her native village in Jhalawad region of peninsular Saurashtra during the 1980s.

The story alternates between {{the past and the}} present. It is a chronicle of the upheavals in the protagonist's personal as well as family life. She was married to an enterprising Brahmin young man, who had migrated to Karachi before India was partitioned. The story unfolds the past on multiple time levels: Pre-independence era especially in the social context, the historical perspective of the partition days and of the socio-cultural turbulence it evoked and engulfed the family of man (This parts describes her years of growth, adolescence and marriage, motherhood), and a vivid portrayal of the violent aftermath of the partition, the fight of the refugees who survived the communal strife, their bizarre movements, separations and reunions as well as socio-ecomomic upheavals they had to face individually and collectively, and finally the era of development and renaissance that swept through the rural Gujarat. The story thus dwells on four generations of Kanchan's clan. The post-partition narration is dominated by a very strong story element including bizarre events, unexpected turns and ever changing dilemma of the protagonist Kanchan. The whole novel contains dialects, proverbs and the folk tongue of Jhalawad, of Karachi and in general of Saurashtra at different times of history.The title Akhepatar is originally a Sanskrit word Akshaypaatra (Devnagari: अक्षयपात्र) which means An inexhaustible container.

Manpower losses could always be made up with more infiltration of regulars from the North and additional recruitment of VC within the South.

The average of battalion sized attacks for example dropped from 9.7 per month to 1.3, while small-scale actions climbed by 150 percent.
