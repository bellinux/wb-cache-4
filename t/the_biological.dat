5|$|Convict {{cichlids}} {{may show}} extended biparental care and adopt unrelated young {{of the same}} species of similar or smaller body size compared to their own biological offspring. The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect, which is when the risk of predation for an individual is reduced because the group size is larger. Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are larger than <b>the</b> <b>biological</b> offspring may be a direct predatory threat to them. However, {{it has been shown that}} as <b>the</b> <b>biological</b> offspring develop and become stronger swimmers, the parents are less active about rejecting larger foreign young, but when they do reject, often foreign young are rejected before they are large enough to be perceived as a direct threat to <b>the</b> <b>biological</b> offspring. Thus, it can be concluded that the brood adoption and rejection rely more heavily on the protection of <b>the</b> <b>biological</b> offspring from differential predator instead of from larger adopted cichlids.|$|E
