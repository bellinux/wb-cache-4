Thinking that Lauren {{had died in the}} explosion, Scott is furious with her. Sugar then proceeds to stab him in order to exact her revenge on Sheila. Troy, a police officer, arrives to the scene and arrests her. Upon seeing her, Lauren immediately knows it is not Sheila whose ankle is sprained. Sugar walks well and has a raspy voice. She confirms that she is Sugar and hates Sheila for ruining her life. Troy then explains Sugar's fingerprints do not match Sheila Carter's. Sheila is then seen in an unidentified plastic surgeon's office. She tells him: [...] "Thank God! Your people were able <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> me." [...] She then uses crutches to walk, has a seat and asks him for a new face.|$|E

6000|$|... "Because {{some people}} are your very {{excellent}} good friends.

60|$|Buster Bear hadn't {{actually}} {{taken the}} fish away from Little Joe. But {{looking at the}} matter as Little Joe did, it amounted to the same thing.

6000|$|... "That is so, chief; we {{will change}} every hour. But {{it will be}} mighty cold. I don't see why we shouldn't rig up a shelter against the wall, and {{have a bit of}} a fire there.

60|$|Timtom {{thanked the}} little wren most gratefully, {{and called to}} the spider <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> its eye.

60|$|Lucy and Mary {{walked along}} the other shore at a greater distance, looking for shells. They found a great many.

60|$|Then Joe {{tried his}} skill at monkey-catching, coming about as near success as Toby had done; and Leander was roused to {{action by the}} new phase the chase had assumed.

6000|$|... "Sure-ly, Mr. Forbes. You've got {{twenty minutes}} {{according}} <b>to</b> regulations. I'll <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> you then. Sorry we haven't any reception {{room in the}} jail. All visits {{has to be made}} in the cells." ...|$|R
60|$|The idea of pining for a dun!

But he never {{collected}} that bill, at last nor {{any part of}} it. I lived to pay it to the banker myself.|$|R

6000|$|The {{well-known}} curly white {{head was}} {{popped out of}} the broken window, and a mild whine seemed to say, [...] "Don't be alarmed, ladies; we won't hurt you.

60|$|But Little Joe wouldn't. The fact is, he {{was afraid}} to. He snarled at Buster Bear and called him a thief and {{everything}} bad he could think of. Buster didn't seem to mind. He chuckled as if he thought it all a great joke and repeated his invitation to Little Joe <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> his fish. But Little Joe just turned his back and went off down the Laughing Brook in a great rage.|$|E
60|$|Another time I {{was perched}} up in a lodged tree, some twenty {{feet from the}} ground, {{watching}} a big bait of fish which I had put in an open spot for anything that might choose <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> it. I was hoping for a bear, and so climbed above the ground {{that he might not}} get my scent should he come from leeward. It was early autumn, and my intentions were wholly peaceable. I had no weapon of any kind.|$|E

6000|$|... "I argey it {{out with}} them.

60|$|At first, it {{was more}} like a dare than {{anything}} else, for when Jim Leonard said he knew a watermelon patch that the owner had no use for, the other boys dared him to tell where it was. He wagged his head, and said that he knew, and then they dared him to tell whose patch it was; and all at once he said it was Bunty Williams's, and dared them <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> the melons with him. None of the boys in the Boy's Town would take a dare, and so they set off with Jim Leonard, one sunny Saturday morning in September.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Christie, not forgotten, only kept {{until the}} last. To-day {{is a good}} day to forgive, as we would be forgiven, and I mean to do it before I sleep," [...] Then holding Christie close, she added, with a quiver of emotion in her voice: [...] "I have no words warm enough to thank you, my good angel, for all you have been to me, but I know {{it will give you}} a great {{pleasure}} to do one thing more.

60|$|Westover, did {{not meet}} Durgin for several days after his return from Lion's Head. He brought {{messages}} for him from his mother and from Whitwell, and he waited for him <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> them so long {{that he had to}} blame himself for not sending them to him. When Jeff appeared, {{at the end of a}} week, Westover had a certain embarrassment in meeting him, and the effort to overcome this carried him beyond his sincerity. He was aware of feigning the cordiality he showed, and of having less real liking for him than ever before. He suggested that he must be busier every day, now, with his college work, and he resented the air of social prosperity which Jeff put on in saying, Yes, there was that, and then he had some engagements which kept him from coming in sooner.|$|E
6000|$|... "They are at {{a cottage}} where an old woman named Brice lives. We were going to stop for {{a drink of water}} when we heard voices, and saw the young men.

They said they would remain, and, if possible, hear what it was all about." ...|$|R

50|$|An {{example of}} Hallstavik's {{outstanding}} citizens, Minnah Karlsson who came {{second in the}} Swedish Idol 2010, Minnah {{is one of the}} few Idol-participants world over who has once been voted out, <b>to</b> then <b>come</b> back <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the final.|$|R
6000|$|M. Nioche {{continued}} {{to stare at the}} bottom of his glass, and his daughter got up, still bravely smiling. [...] "You mean that I look so much like one? That's more than most women do nowadays. Don't judge me yet a while," [...] she added. [...] "I mean to succeed; that's what I mean to do. I leave you; I don't mean to be seen in cafes, for one thing. I can't think what you want of my poor father; he's very comfortable now. It isn't his fault, either. Au revoir, little father." [...] And she tapped the old man on the head with her muff. Then she stopped a minute, looking at Newman. [...] "Tell M. de Bellegarde, when he wants news of me, <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> it from ME!" [...] And she turned and departed, the white-aproned waiter, with a bow, holding the door wide open for her.|$|E
60|$|So David triumphed: and {{yet that}} triumph was only the {{beginning}} of his troubles. Sad and weary years had he to struggle on before he gained the kingdom which God had promised him. So it is often with God's elect. He gives them blessings at first, to show them that He is really with them; and then He lets them be evil-entreated by tyrants, and suffer persecution, and wander out of the way in the wilderness, that they may be made perfect by suffering, and purified, as gold is in the refiner's fire, from all selfishness, conceit, ambition, cowardliness, till they learn to trust God utterly, to know their own weakness, and His strength, and to work only for Him, careless what becomes of their own poor worthless selves, provided they can help His kingdom <b>to</b> <b>come,</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> His will to be done on earth as it is in heaven.|$|E
60|$|I {{was eager}} to be ashore and see Japan, but the first day was devoted to ship's work, and not until evening did we sailors land. And here, by the very system of things, by the way life was {{organised}} and men transacted affairs, John Barleycorn reached out and tucked my arm in his. The captain had given money for us to the hunters, and the hunters were waiting in a certain Japanese public house for us <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> it. We rode to the place in rickshaws. Our own crowd had taken possession of it. Drink was flowing. Everybody had money, and everybody was treating. After the hundred days of hard toil and absolute abstinence, in the pink of physical condition, bulging with health, over-spilling with spirits that had long been pent by discipline and circumstance, of course {{we would have a}} drink or two. And after that we would see the town.|$|E
50|$|In 2017, Ramírez {{started as}} an {{important}} reliever out of the bullpen, but when struggling youngster Blake Snell was demoted, Ramírez was put in the starting rotation. On May 28, Ramírez was forced <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a save in a fifteen inning affair with the Minnesota Twins. On May 29, Ramírez became the first pitcher since Dennis Martinez, Ramírez's childhood idol, to start a game the day after receiving a save.|$|R
