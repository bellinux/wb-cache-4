500|$|The {{production}} team wanted the episode {{to be about}} trash, and show runner Mike Scully pitched the idea that Homer should run for office. Writer Ian Maxtone-Graham {{had a friend who}} had made their way in Chicago politics, through the Sanitation Commission, and so he decided that Homer should run for Sanitation Commissioner. They then {{spent a lot of time}} trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> that Homer would have an [...] "over filled trash can", and through its extensive use of packaging, the concept of Love Day was formed. Originally the episode saw Homer running for mayor, but this idea was abandoned. The ending was talked about for a while, with the original idea being that the whole town would be raised up and the rubbish be swept underneath. The ending was not intended to carry an environmental message, but it played well and is what the staff believe won the episode an Emmy.|$|E

2500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Michelle Erica Green called the episode [...] "an episode of mythic proportion, with a tour de force {{performance}} by Avery Brooks" [...] in her review for TrekNation. She praised the plot in the episode saying that [...] "what Sisko really did was choose tactics over intuition, or perhaps intellect over spirituality...and it was the wrong choice. This is a stunning moment for Star Trek: an acknowledgement that there are forces in the universe which cannot be coerced, manipulated, or (as in the case of Q and the Organians) talked into submission by Starfleet captains." [...] She hoped that the repercussions from the episode would lead into the seventh series. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] thought that the episode took a while <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point,</b> but then it delivered, using the death of Jadzia in a way to drop Sisko [...] "into an abyss of despair". He thought that the melodrama in Jadzia's pregnancy and subsequent death was exaggerated, and that the manner of the death was random, but the context of the effects of Jadzia's death and the funeral scene [...] "really works". While he was pleased with some of the characterizations in the episode, such as Jeffrey Combs as Weyoun, he felt that the scene with Quark and Bashir was unnecessary. He gave the episode a score of three and a half out of four.|$|E
