5|$|Adobe Systems' first {{acquisition}} was Emerald City Software in March 1990. In August 1994, {{the company}} acquired Aldus, a Seattle-based software company credited with creating <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> publishing industry with its PageMaker software. The company's products were integrated into Adobe Systems' product line {{later in the}} year, and re-branded as Adobe PageMaker and Adobe After Effects; Aldus also owned the TIFF file format, transferring ownership to Adobe. In October 1995, Adobe acquired <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> publishing software company Frame Technology for US$566million, and re-branded its FrameMaker software to Adobe FrameMaker. Adobe acquired GoLive Systems in January 1999 and obtained its CyberStudio HTML editor software, releasing it as Adobe GoLive. In May 2003, Adobe acquired Syntrillium Software and its digital audio editor software Cool Edit Pro, and merged it into its product line, re-releasing it as Adobe Audition.|$|E
5|$|Since GNOME 3.2 Web allows {{creating}} application launchers for web applications. The subsequent {{invocation of}} a launcher {{brings up a}} plain single instance of Web limited to one domain, with off-site links opening in a normal browser. The launcher created this way is accessible from <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> and {{is not limited to}} GNOME Shell. For instance it may be used with Unity, used on Ubuntu. This feature facilitates the integration of <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> and World Wide Web, which is a goal of Web's developers. Similar features {{can be found in the}} Windows version of Google Chrome. For the same purpose Mozilla Foundation previously developed a standalone application Mozilla Prism, which was superseded by the project Chromeless.|$|E
50|$|On each <b>desktop,</b> <b>the</b> tray icon {{also allows}} access to <b>the</b> other <b>desktop's</b> files. <b>The</b> user can {{copy and paste}} files or text between <b>the</b> <b>desktops.</b>|$|R
50|$|In March 2008, the ultra-small M57 and M57p {{desktops}} were announced. This {{was because}} the M57 and M57p were <b>the</b> first <b>desktops</b> from any manufacturer to receive a GREENGUARD certification. <b>The</b> <b>desktops</b> were also rated by EPEAT Gold and Energy Star 4.0, and were <b>the</b> first ThinkCentre <b>desktops</b> to feature post-consumer recycled content. The noise levels of <b>the</b> <b>desktops</b> were also low - at 4.0bels or lower.|$|R
50|$|Unlike most {{more recent}} virtual window managers, tvtwm models the root window {{as a single}} large space, with <b>the</b> {{physical}} <b>desktop</b> being a viewport onto that virtual root window. The user can scroll the viewport around <b>the</b> virtual <b>desktop</b> either by pressing certain keys or by clicking into a scaled down representation of <b>the</b> virtual <b>desktop,</b> <b>the</b> so-called panner.|$|R
5|$|The last section {{provides}} {{access to}} TuneUp Styler and TuneUp System Control. TuneUp System Control is a program that allows access {{to some of the}} obscure or harder-to-access settings of Microsoft Windows, similar to Tweak UI. TuneUp Styler allows for customization of the Windows user interface by changing <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> appearance, icons, and the logon and startup screens.|$|E
5|$|AMD chose a {{different}} direction, designing the less radical x86-64, a 64-bit extension {{to the existing}} x86 architecture, which Microsoft then supported, forcing Intel to introduce the same extensions in its own x86-based processors. These designs can run existing 32-bit applications at native hardware speed, while offering support for 64-bit memory addressing and other enhancements to new applications. This architecture has now become the predominant 64-bit architecture in <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> and portable market. Although some Itanium-based workstations were initially introduced by companies such as SGI, {{they are no longer}} available.|$|E
5|$|Charms {{have been}} removed; their {{functionality}} in Windows Store apps is accessed from an App commands menu on their title bar. In its place is Action Center, which displays notifications and settings toggles. It is accessed by clicking an icon in the notification area, or dragging {{from the right}} of the screen. Notifications can be synced between multiple devices. The Settings app (formerly PC Settings) was refreshed and now includes more options that were previously exclusive to <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> Control Panel.|$|E
50|$|Motif is {{the basic}} {{building}} block of <b>the</b> Common <b>Desktop</b> Environment, which was <b>the</b> standard <b>desktop</b> for commercial Unix.|$|R
50|$|Window {{management}} as of version 6.0.2 is handled by <b>the</b> Xfce <b>Desktop</b> Environment. Previous versions used <b>the</b> LXDE <b>Desktop</b> Environment.|$|R
50|$|Foresight {{focuses on}} {{delivering}} <b>the</b> latest in <b>desktop</b> technologies. It usually has current packages for <b>the</b> GNOME <b>desktop</b> environment, sometimes even {{within a day}} of their release. Projects such as GNOME Do, Banshee and PackageKit are delivered in the default Foresight installation. Beyond the existing GNOME Edition, Xfce and KDE Edition are available. These two editions have the same focus of delivering <b>the</b> latest <b>desktop</b> technologies for <b>the</b> respective <b>desktop</b> environments.|$|R
5|$|There is no upgrade path to Windows 10 for devices running Windows RT. Windows 10 Mobile, {{based on}} Windows Phone, was {{unveiled}} {{for use on}} future tablets and smartphones with ARM architecture. Subsequently, Microsoft {{announced that it would}} also support <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> version of Windows 10 on ARM architecture devices (particularly laptops), with emulation of the IA-32 architecture to enable compatibility with existing software.|$|E
5|$|Windows 8.1 {{received}} mixed reception, {{although more}} positive than Windows 8, with critics praising the expanded functionality available to apps {{in comparison to}} 8, its OneDrive integration, along with its user interface tweaks {{and the addition of}} expanded tutorials for operating the Windows 8 interface. Despite these improvements, Windows 8.1 was still criticized for not addressing all digressions of Windows 8 (such as a poor level of integration between Metro-style apps and <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> interface), and the potential privacy implications of the expanded use of online services. , the market share of Windows 8.1 is 6.40%.|$|E
5|$|According to StatCounter {{market share}} {{statistics}} (based on web use proxy), Iceland {{was the first}} country where Windows 10 was ranked first (not only on <b>the</b> <b>desktop,</b> it also holds across all platforms), with several bigger European countries following (a British Crown dependency Isle of Man got there first ahead of any country, late in 2015) and others such as Canada (most popular on desktops; iOS still more popular, ranked first). For one week late in November 2016, Windows 10 overtook first rank from Windows 7 in the United States, before losing it again; it becomes more popular every weekend.|$|E
50|$|In March 2009, two small, {{low-cost}} desktops {{were announced}} by Lenovo: the ThinkCentre A58 and the ThinkCentre M58e. <b>The</b> A58 <b>desktop</b> {{was designed for}} small and medium businesses, while the M58e was designed for medium-sized and large enterprises. <b>The</b> <b>desktops</b> were made available in both tower and small form-factor versions.|$|R
5000|$|All IdeaCentres are {{all-in-one}} machines, combining {{processor and}} monitor {{into a single}} unit. <b>The</b> <b>desktops</b> were described by HotHardware as being [...] "uniquely designed". <b>The</b> first IdeaCentre <b>desktop,</b> <b>the</b> IdeaCentre K210, was announced by Lenovo on 30 June 2008. While the IdeaCentre line consists only of desktops, it shares design elements and features with the IdeaPad line. One such feature was Veriface facial recognition technology.|$|R
50|$|Bodhi Linux {{was built}} around <b>the</b> Enlightenment 17 <b>desktop,</b> but forked it to create <b>the</b> Moksha <b>desktop.</b>|$|R
5|$|Adobe Systems is an American {{computer}} software company headquartered in San Jose, California. In 1982, John Warnock and Charles Geschke left Xerox PARC and established Adobe Systems {{to develop and}} sell the PostScript page description language. Apple Computer licensed PostScript in 1985 for use in its LaserWriter printers, which helped spark <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> publishing revolution. The company has acquired 25companies, purchased stakes in 5 companies, and divested 6companies, {{most of which were}} software companies. Of the companies that Adobe Systems has acquired, 18 were based in the United States. Adobe Systems has not released the financial details for most of these mergers and acquisitions.|$|E
5|$|Cooperative {{multitasking}} {{made its}} Macintosh debut in March 1985 {{with a program}} called Switcher by Andy Hertzfeld, which allowed the user to launch multiple applications and switch between them. Many programs and features did not function correctly with Switcher. Also, Switcher did not display windows of other applications beside the selected one. It was not included with the operating system, but was available from Apple for purchase separately. Both System 5 and System 6 had a feature called MultiFinder instead, which was much more mature and widely used in System 6. MultiFinder could be enabled or disabled, with a reboot. If disabled, the Finder would quit when the user launched another application, thus freeing RAM for it. If enabled, the system behaved as in the nowadays familiar multitasking tradition, with <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> and windows of other applications in the screen's background.|$|E
5|$|The PowerBook100 was {{the first}} PowerBook to {{incorporate}} SCSI Disk Mode, which allowed it {{to be used as}} an external hard disk on a desktop Macintosh. This provided a convenient method for software to be installed onto the PowerBook or transferred to <b>the</b> <b>desktop,</b> without the need for the 100's optional floppy disk drive. A specialized SCSI cable with a unique connector was required, however, to use any SCSI device on the PowerBook series. A second dedicated cable was required for SCSI Disk Mode. This feature was unique to the 100 until Apple introduced new PowerBooks more than a year later.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> Plasma <b>Desktop,</b> {{being one}} of the most {{recognized}} projects of KDE, is <b>the</b> default <b>desktop</b> environment on many Linux distributions, such as openSUSE, Mageia, Chakra, Kubuntu, Manjaro Linux, and PCLinuxOS. It was also <b>the</b> default <b>desktop</b> environment on PC-BSD, but was later replaced with Lumina, a desktop environment which, like KDE, is written in C++ and Qt.|$|R
50|$|Updates to <b>the</b> Windows <b>Desktop</b> Update {{were part}} of IE 4.0 hotfixes and service packs. Later, shell {{security}} updates for Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 included both the update to <b>the</b> Windows <b>Desktop</b> Update version and the original version. Also sometimes <b>the</b> Windows <b>Desktop</b> Update version and the update to the original version were packaged separately.|$|R
50|$|The ThinkCentre M57 and M57p {{desktops}} {{were announced}} in September 2007 by Lenovo. These were <b>the</b> first <b>desktops</b> from a manufacturer {{to receive a}} GREENGUARD certification. In addition, both desktops were EPEAT Gold and Energy Star 4.0 rated. They were also <b>the</b> first ThinkCentre <b>desktops</b> to incorporate recycled material from consumer plastics. <b>The</b> <b>desktops</b> were equipped with up to Intel Core 2 Duo processors, up to 2GB DDR2 RAM, integrated graphics, and up to 160GB hard disk drive.|$|R
5|$|The {{suite of}} pre-loaded apps bundled with Windows 8 were changed in Windows 8.1; PC Settings was {{expanded}} to include options that were previously exclusive to <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> Control Panel, Windows Store was updated with an improved interface for browsing apps and automatic updates, the Mail app includes an updated interface and additional features, the Camera app integrates Photosynth for creating panoramas, and additional editing tools {{were added to the}} Photos app (while integration with Flickr and Facebook was completely removed). A number of additional stock apps were also added, including Calculator, Food and Drink, Health and Fitness, Sound Recorder, Reading List (which can be used to collect and sync content from apps through OneDrive), Scan, and Help + Tips. For Windows RT users, Windows 8.1 also adds a version of Microsoft Outlook to the included Office 2013 RT suite. However, it does not support data loss protection, Group Policy, Lync integration, or creating emails with information rights management. Windows Store is enabled by default within Windows To Go environments.|$|E
25|$|JPEG files can be {{natively}} set as <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> wallpaper {{without using}} Active Desktop (which {{is no longer}} supported). Also, the aspect ratio of images is maintained properly while applying them as <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> wallpaper.|$|E
25|$|The {{version is}} {{considerably}} similar to <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> version, however still lacking {{several of the}} key features seen on <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> version such as God Mode and My Sim mode. This version is no longer available on Apple's iTunes App Store.|$|E
50|$|Additional updates to <b>the</b> <b>desktops</b> {{included}} {{greater use}} of ThinkVantage technologies. All desktop models were made available with ImageUltra. <b>The</b> three <b>desktop</b> models also included an 'Access IBM' button, allowing access to onboard resources, diagnostic tools, automated solutions, and links to online updates and services. Select models featured IBM's Embedded Security Subsystem, with an integrated security chip and IBM Client Security Software.|$|R
50|$|Dreamlinux 3.5 is {{an update}} to the {{original}} Dreamlinux 3.0 desktop. This release features <b>the</b> XFCE <b>desktop</b> with <b>the</b> Gnome <b>Desktop</b> as an additional option {{in the form of}} a module. This release uses <b>the</b> Debian Lenny <b>desktop.</b> It features <b>the</b> Linux kernel version 2.6.28.5 as well as new icons and a new GTK+ theme.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also an}} Internet Café {{in which}} service members and {{contractors}} can connect to the pay-as-you-go internet with laptops or use <b>the</b> <b>desktops</b> provided. Internet cards {{can be purchased at}} Planet Mazar.|$|R
25|$|Users {{can select}} <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> {{environment}} within Wubi. But, because each desktop environment {{is also available}} as an application package, {{it is recommended that}} users install Ubuntu (default option) and from there install the other desktop environments. When users log in, they can choose <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> environment to use.|$|E
25|$|These include {{grouping}} {{and multiple}} row layout {{in the task}} bar, icon hiding in the system tray, panel autohiding, window previews and tooltips {{are back in the}} panel and task bar, notifications and job tracking by Plasma, and the ability to have icons on <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> again by using a Folder View as <b>the</b> <b>desktop</b> background where icons now remain where they are placed.|$|E
25|$|The December CTP {{was also}} the last build of Windows Vista that {{supported}} the bypassing of the WDDM driver model requirement, hence allowing <b>the</b> <b>Desktop</b> Window Manager (UXSS {{at the time of}} the build) to run using software vertex emulation. Because of this change post the 5270 builds, the well known keys 'UseMachineCheck' and 'EnableMachineCheck do not allow running <b>the</b> <b>Desktop</b> Window Manager in software emulation mode.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, an ultra-small {{version of}} the S50 was announced, <b>the</b> {{smallest}} <b>desktop</b> PC introduced until that time by IBM. The ultra-small ThinkCentre S50 <b>desktop</b> weighed approximately <b>the</b> same as IBM's first notebook (IBM 5140 PC Convertible). <b>The</b> ultra-small <b>desktop</b> was roughly <b>the</b> size of a New York city phonebook, or a box of cereal. <b>The</b> ultra-small <b>desktop</b> also featured a tool-free tool-less steel chassis and IBM ThinkVantage Technologies.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> user's <b>Desktop</b> is {{a special}} folder that resides {{at the root of}} the Shell namespace. Although this folder maps by default to a {{physical}} folder stored in the user's profile folder, <b>the</b> special <b>desktop</b> folder is represented as a distinct object from <b>the</b> physical <b>desktop</b> folder. <b>The</b> same holds true with the [...] "My Documents" [...] (Windows 95 through XP) or user [...] "Documents" [...] (Windows Vista+) folder.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>the</b> Cinnamon <b>desktop</b> {{environment}} {{intends to}} implement a graphical user interface (GUI) distinct from <b>the</b> GNOME <b>desktop</b> environment, many of the GNOME Core Applications were forked, so that their GUIs can be rewritten appropriately.|$|R
