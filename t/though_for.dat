5|$|Historically, Aldermaston was a hundred, <b>though</b> <b>for</b> {{a period}} it {{was within the}} Theale hundred. By the 19th century, the {{hundreds}} had been superseded by other sub-divisions. From then on, Aldermaston was, at times, part of the Bradfield Poor Law Union and Sanitary District, and the registration sub-districts of Mortimer (late 19th century) and Bucklebury (early 20th century). It was at all times an ecclesiastical parish and acquired civil parish status in the 1890s.|$|E

5|$|According to William of Tyre, on 27 July the crusaders {{decided to}} move to the plain on {{the eastern side of the}} city, which was less heavily {{fortified}} but had much less food and water. It was recorded by some that Unur had bribed the leaders to move to a less defensible position, and that Unur had promised to break off his alliance with Nur ad-Din if the crusaders went home. Meanwhile, Nur ad-Din and Saif ad-Din had by now arrived. With Nur ad-Din in the field it was impossible to return to their better position. The local crusader lords refused to carry on with the siege, and the three kings had no choice but to abandon the city. First Conrad, then the rest of the army, decided to retreat to Jerusalem on 28 July, <b>though</b> <b>for</b> their entire retreat they were followed by Turkish archers who constantly harassed them.|$|E
5|$|After her Carlisle victories, Ferrier {{began to}} receive offers of singing engagements. Her first {{appearance}} {{as a professional}} vocalist, in autumn 1937, was at a harvest festival celebration in the village church at Aspatria. She was paid one guinea. After winning the gold cup at the 1938 Workington Festival, Ferrier sang Ma Curly-Headed Babby in a concert at Workington Opera House. Cecil McGivern, producer of a BBC Northern radio variety show, was in the audience and was sufficiently impressed to book her for the next edition of his programme, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 23 February 1939. This broadcast—her first as a vocalist—attracted wide attention, and led to more radio work, <b>though</b> <b>for</b> Ferrier the event was overshadowed {{by the death of}} her mother at the beginning of February. At the 1939 Carlisle Festival, Ferrier sang Richard Strauss's song All Souls' Day, a performance which particularly impressed one of the adjudicators, J. E. Hutchinson, a music teacher with a considerable reputation. Ferrier became his pupil and, under his guidance, began to extend her repertoire to include works by Bach, Handel, Brahms and Elgar.|$|E
5|$|Amidst the {{backdrop}} of the Battle of Britain, while stationed on Salisbury Plain the battalion carried out garrison duties and undertook training to enable them to rapidly respond in the event that an invasion took place. They received a large amount of new equipment during this time to improve their mobility, including new Universal carriers, weapons and lightweight personal load carrying equipment. They also experienced German air attacks for the first time, and on 8 July 1940, the battalion incurred its first casualty when one of its members was wounded in an air raid. In early October, the 2/10th undertook a large-scale exercise near Tidworth, and then {{in the middle of the}} month, as winter set in they were moved to Colchester, where they replaced the tents they had been living in with the stone buildings and Nissen huts of Hyderabad Barracks. The battalion's stay there was short-lived, <b>though,</b> <b>for</b> the following month, after the threat of invasion had passed, the order arrived for the Australians to embark for the Middle East. The 2/10th subsequently entrained at Colchester in mid-November and moved north to Scotland where, on 17 November, they boarded the Straithaird.|$|E

5|$|As Galveston's {{traditional}} economy declined, Texas' {{oil boom}} began in 1901, with oil wells and refineries constructed throughout the state. Galveston's direct {{role in this}} boom was minimal as investors avoided building pipelines and refineries on the island itself (<b>though</b> <b>for</b> a time oil was shipped through the island). Nevertheless, wealth {{brought on by the}} boom transformed nearby Houston, Texas City, Goose Creek (modern Baytown), and other communities. Houston in particular became home to a large community of wealthy businessmen and investors. Galveston became even more tourism-focused as the city sought to attract these nearby nouveau riche. Still, in the first two decades after the 1900 storm, the city's economy struggled to recover.|$|E
5|$|Caracalla {{was born}} in Lugdunum, Gaul (now Lyon, France), on 4April 188 to Septimius Severus and Julia Domna. He had a {{slightly}} younger brother, Geta, who would briefly rule as co-emperor alongside him. Caracalla's father, Septimius Severus, appointed Caracalla joint Augustus and full emperor from the year 198 onwards. His brother Geta was granted the same title in 210. In 202 Caracalla was forced to marry the daughter of Gaius Fulvius Plautianus, Fulvia Plautilla, a woman whom he hated, <b>though</b> <b>for</b> what reason is unknown. By 205 Caracalla had succeeded in having Plautianus executed for treason, though he had probably fabricated {{the evidence of the}} plot himself. It was then that he banished his wife, whose later killing might have been carried out under Caracalla's orders.|$|E
5|$|Howard Shore composed, orchestrated, conducted, and {{produced}} the trilogy's music. He {{was hired in}} August 2000 and visited the set, and watched the assembly cuts of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King. In the music, Shore included many (85 to 110) leitmotifs to represent various characters, cultures, and places - the largest catalogue of leitmotives {{in the history of}} cinema, surpassing - for comparison - that of the entire Star Wars saga. For example, there are multiple leitmotifs just for the hobbits and the Shire. Although the first film had some of its score recorded in Wellington, virtually all of the trilogy's score was recorded in Watford Town Hall and mixed at Abbey Road Studios. Jackson planned to advise the score for six weeks each year in London, <b>though</b> <b>for</b> The Two Towers he stayed for twelve. As a Beatles fan, Jackson had a photo tribute done there on the zebra crossing.|$|E
