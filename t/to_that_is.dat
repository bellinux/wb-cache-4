5|$|Within {{the genus}} Gymnopilus, {{it is located}} in the {{subgenus}} Gymnopilus and section Macrospori. The subgenus Gymnopilus was proposed by Henri Romagnesi as Cortinatae (while the genus was known as Fulvidula) in 1942, though the name Gymnopilus was given later by Rolf Singer. The subgenus is characterised by mushrooms that feature either no veils, or veils that do not form rings. The section Macrospori, proposed by Guzmán-Dávalos in 1995, is made up of large-spored species with ringless mushrooms. Molecular analysis revealed that G.maritimus forms a sister group <b>to</b> (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> shares an immediate common ancestor with) the spectabilis–imperialis clade, a clade that includes G.imperialis, G.spectabilis, G.junonius (often considered synonymous with G.spectabilis), G.pampeanus, and others. G. maritimus forms a more inclusive clade along with the members of spectabilis–imperialis; while it produces the smallest fruit bodies, it shares with the other members strong, sturdy mushrooms, caps with fibrils (sometimes with scales) and large, warty spores that turn red in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's iodine.|$|E
25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} there are six grades of ritual baths, each higher than the other. The first is {{rainwater}} in a water hole.

Superior <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the water of a fountain whose own water is little but has been increased by a greater quantity of drawn water. Superior to that are salty or hot waters from a spring, which can render clean when flowing. And superior to that are living waters, which serve for the immersion of persons who have a running issue and for the sprinkling of persons with skin disease, and are valid for {{the preparation of the}} water of purification.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1470s, he began to expand his printing and publishing range. Besides theological works, Eggestein now increasingly printed legal works of canon and civil law, such as the Decretum Gratiani (1471), as well as the Decretales of Gregory IX and the Constitutiones of Pope Clement V. That put him in direct competition with Peter Schöffer, who also issued legal titles in on a large scale. Furthermore, Heinrich Eggestein printed antique classics (e.g., Virgil's Bucolica, Cicero's De officiis or Julius Caesar's De bello gallico), but directed his special interest to Latin works of Medieval authors. Thus he published the Legenda aurea of Jacobus de Voragine, De miseria conditionis humanae by Pope Innocent III, as well as works by Bonaventura and Bernhard von Clairvaux, among others. German language titles were quite rare in his range. An important exception <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the second German Bible, based on the Mentelin Bible, which Eggestein published in 1470. Further vernacular titles were Lucius Apuleius' The Golden Ass (Translator: Niklas von Wyle) and an edition of Belial.|$|E

25|$|Wolverhampton has {{a number}} of live music venues; the largest {{occasionally}} used being the football ground, Molineux Stadium, which was used for a Bon Jovi concert in 2003, but the biggest indoor venue regularly used is Wolverhampton Civic Hall, with a standing capacity of 3,000. Second <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> Wulfrun Hall (part of the same complex as the Civic Hall, which is owned and operated by the City Council) which has a standing capacity of just over 1,100. The Civic Halls complex also has a newer venue, The Slade Rooms (named after the 1970s rock band), which has a capacity of approximately 550 standing. There are also a number of smaller venues with capacities of between 100 and 250, although the longest-established of these, the Wolverhampton Varsity, is now closed, as is the Little Civic. Other venues include the Light Bar in Fryer Street, the 'Numa Bar' and the Dog & Doublet (next to the old Little Civic), although the situation in this area of entertainment remains fluid. The 18th-century St John's Church is a popular venue for smaller scale classical concerts. The city is also home to Regent Records, a choral and organ music recording company, and Wolf Town DIY, an independent record label that primarily releases punk and alternative music by underground artists. The Midland Box Office is the primary sales point for most of Wolverhampton's venues and is situated in Queen Square, it is manned by a small team of dedicated and enthusiastic staff.|$|E
500|$|Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which {{modify the}} {{activity}} of other proteins by adding phosphate groups <b>to</b> (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> phosphorylating) them, are important regulators of homologous recombination in eukaryotes. [...] When DNA replication begins in budding yeast, [...] the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 begins homologous recombination by phosphorylating the Sae2 protein. [...] After being so activated {{by the addition of}} a phosphate, Sae2 uses its endonuclease activity to make a clean cut near a double-strand break in DNA. [...] This allows a three-part protein known as the MRX complex to bind to DNA, and begins a series of protein-driven reactions that exchange material between two DNA molecules.|$|E

The building has a slate roof with copings of stone. At the west end, there is a gabled bellcote with one bell; crosses made of iron are fixed to the roofs of the chancel and south chapel. The nave of the church, which has two bays, was probably built in the 12th century. An entrance at {{the west end of}} the nave has been blocked up and plastered over on the outside. The chancel, which is smaller than the nave, and a chapel (on {{the south side of the}} building attached to the nave) were added in the 14th century, and the arches dividing the nave from the chapel and the chancel are of this date.
