5|$|In 2010, {{writer and}} {{researcher}} Bea Uusma at Karolinska institutet, Sweden, rejected the <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> larvae of Trichinella spiralis killed the expedition members. After examining the men's clothes, she concluded {{that at least}} Strindberg was killed by polar bears.|$|E

40|$|Argentina's {{economic}} and institutional decline has long posed a conundrum to economists and social scientists. In particular, it challenges <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> seek to explain cross-country growth differences over time. Those <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> claim that institutions have a first-order effect on growth cannot explain the persistent economic decadence {{of a country}} that in 1930 was among the most institutionally advanced in Latin America. <b>Theories</b> <b>that</b> claim that that education and growth precede inclusive institutions face a similar problem, since Argentina {{was one of the most}} educationally advanced countries in Latin America. The same can be said of <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> claim that social capital is the determinant factor that explains long-term growth. This paper emphasizes the key role played by recurrent cycles of populism in pushing the country into secular decadence and posits that, in Argentina, rising commodity prices have driven the cycles of populism...|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> attempt to explain what love is, and what function it serves. It {{would be very difficult}} to explain love to a hypothetical person who had not himself or herself experienced love or being loved. In fact, to such a person love would appear to be quite strange if not outright irrational behavior. Among the prevailing types of <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> attempt to account for the existence of love there are: psychological theories, the vast majority of which consider love to be very healthy behavior; there are evolutionary <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> hold that love is part of the process of natural selection; there are spiritual <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> may, for instance consider love to be a gift from God; there are also <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> consider love to be an unexplainable mystery, very much like a mystical experience.|$|R
30|$|We first {{discuss the}} strong {{relationship}} between RDR and default theories. We also characterised default <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> can be mapped to RDR trees. We then discuss the relationship between default theories and NRDR. We discuss how the policies presented {{in the previous section}} translate to constraints on default <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> can be mapped to NRDR. We will show how default <b>theories,</b> <b>that</b> can be mapped to NRDR, are less constrained than theories which can be mapped to RDR. That is, the set of default <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> can be mapped to NRDR is larger than the set of those that can be mapped to RDR.|$|R
5|$|A <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> {{they were}} {{descendants}} of a 2nd-century chieftain called Kandachaliki Remmanaka, a feudatory of the Andhra Ikshvaku (from an Ikshvaku inscription of the 2nd century) was put forward. This according to Kamath {{has failed to}} explain the difference in lineage. The Kandachaliki feudatory call themselves Vashisthiputras of the Hiranyakagotra. The Chalukyas, however, address themselves as Harithiputras of Manavyasagotra in their inscriptions, {{which is the same}} lineage as their early overlords, the Kadambas of Banavasi. This makes them descendants of the Kadambas. The Chalukyas took control of the territory formerly ruled by the Kadambas.|$|E
5|$|Another area of {{interest}} for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies. Her discovery that some gas and stars moved {{in the opposite direction}} to the rotation {{of the rest of the}} galaxy challenged the prevailing <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> all of the material in a galaxy moved in the same direction, and provided the first evidence for galaxy mergers and the process by which galaxies initially formed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} theoretical {{idea that}} {{plays a role}} in M-theory is supersymmetry. This is a mathematical relation that exists in certain physical theories between a class of particles called bosons and a class of particles called fermions. Roughly speaking, fermions are the constituents of matter, while bosons mediate interactions between particles. In theories with supersymmetry, each boson has a counterpart which is a fermion, and vice versa. When supersymmetry is imposed as a local symmetry, one automatically obtains a quantum mechanical <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> includes gravity. Such a theory is called a supergravity theory.|$|E
50|$|Although the <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> premise doublespeak {{are still}} indefinite, {{there are some}} <b>theories</b> <b>that</b> have {{parallels}} with the theory of doublespeak and Orwell's ideology in Nineteen Eighty-Four and might possibly provide {{a better understanding of}} where doublespeak's theories could have come from.|$|R

5|$|At a waterfall, {{another girl}} commits suicide by drowning. The girl, Carlin, looks {{identical}} to Lauren. Andrews performs an autopsy on Carlin as well, finding the same astrological symbol. It also {{becomes clear that}} the two girls are related—identical twins, born seven years apart. The girls are clones, produced using a technique {{similar to that used}} to create identical cattle. Black believes that this is connected to Hoffman's Earth Changes <b>theory,</b> <b>that</b> someone is breeding offspring destined to survive May 5, 2000.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with William Stanley Jevons and Clément Juglar in the 1860s, economists {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} cycles of frequent, violent shifts in economic activity. A key milestone in this endeavor was {{the foundation of the}} U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research by Wesley Mitchell in 1920. This marked the beginning of a boom in atheoretical, statistical models of economic fluctuation (models based on cycles and trends instead of economic <b>theory)</b> <b>that</b> led to the discovery of apparently regular economic patterns like the Kuznets wave.|$|E
5|$|Conservapedia's {{article on}} {{evolution}} presents evolution as a naturalistic <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> lacks support and that conflicts with {{evidence in the}} fossil record that creationists perceive to support creationism.

5|$|During World War II, {{he worked}} on the Manhattan Project that {{developed}} the first atomic bombs. In 1949, he began developing his <b>theory</b> <b>that,</b> contrary to what was then believed, not all atomic nuclei are spherical. His ideas were later tested and confirmed by Aage Bohr's and Ben Mottelson's experiments. He also contributed to the scientific understanding of X-rays and participated in the United States Atomic Energy Commission and naval research projects.|$|E
5|$|During its review, Sandia {{determined}} that a significant overram of the powder bags into the gun had occurred as it was being loaded and that the overram could have caused the explosion. A subsequent test by the Navy of the overram scenario confirmed that an overram could have caused {{an explosion in the}} gun breech. Sandia's technicians also found that the physical evidence did not support the U.S. Navy's <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> an electronic or chemical detonator had been used to initiate the explosion.|$|E

5|$|Eastern Orthodox theologians are {{generally}} {{critical of the}} <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> Gregory was influenced by neoplatonism. For example, Metropolitan Hierotheos of Nafpaktos argues in Life After Death that Gregory opposed all philosophical (as opposed to theological) endeavour as tainted with worldliness. This view is supported by Against Euthonius, where Gregory denounces Euthonius for placing {{the results of his}} systematic Aristotelean philosophy above the traditional teachings of the Church.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, the Estonian {{astronomer}} Ernst Öpik gave {{a distance}} determination {{that supported the}} <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> the Andromeda Nebula is indeed a distant extra-galactic object.

Wilson telescope, Edwin Hubble was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some Cepheid variables, thus allowing him to estimate {{the distance to the}} nebulae: they were far too distant {{to be part of the}} Milky Way. In 1936 Hubble produced a classification of galactic morphology that is used to this day.|$|E
