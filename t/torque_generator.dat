A Knee brace also has a knee joint mechanism for securing stability of a knee during the stance phase. Performance of the prosthetic knee joint highly affects activity and a cure of the patient. However, the practical knee joint mechanism that can generate active joint torque has almost never appeared, because of the problems of overweight, mechanical noise and energy consumption. In this study, a new joint mechanism that would be able to generate extensional knee joint torque by utilizing ground reaction force without an external energy source was examined.

Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a number of motB mutants. As found previously for motA, many alleles of motB were dominant, as expected if MotB is a component of the motor.

Most of the mutations mapped to a hydrophilic, periplasmic domain of the protein, and nothing comparable to the slow-swimming alleles of motA, which show normal torque when tethered, was found.

40|$|Lower Extremity Exoskeleton {{technology}} has been geared towards benefiting medical and augmentation fields. Functional modularity in exoskeleton design allows practitioners to prescribe exoskeletons which can be geared towards the user's needs and abilities. While most modular knee exoskeleton technology either live {{in the realm of}} medicine or augmentation, a stance assistive knee exoskeleton can benefit both able bodied individuals as well as individuals with decreased quadriceps function or knee weakness. Fully passive systems are lower cost but have limited functionality. Powered systems have diverse functionality but are expensive and large. Microcontroller controlled resistive knees are more functionally diverse than fully passive system, but only provide system resistance to motion and can be expensive. Passive microcontroller controlled systems can lead to a low cost and functionally versatile system. By embedding some of the required functionality into the mechanical hardware of the system, the burden on the microcontrollers and need for sensors is reduced. To determine the required functionality the characteristic behavior of the knee during level walking and stair descent were studied. Characteristics for a stance assistive knee joint exoskeleton are derived using biomechanics data. These characteristics are 1) 	The joint provides resistance to flexion during stance 2) 	The joint does not impede extension during stance 3) 	The joint can enter free mode under load at any knee angle 4) 	The joint has very low impedance / is free while extending and flexing during swingA dual jointed architecture with a clutch connected across one joint and a <b>torque</b> <b>generator</b> connected across the other is developed to mechanically achieve requirements 1 and 4. By requiring the clutch or <b>torque</b> <b>generator</b> to provide resistance in one direction but no impedance in the other, characteristic 2 is achieved. By controlling the locking and unlocking of the clutch, characteristic 3 is achieved. The <b>torque</b> <b>generator</b> and clutch requirements can be fulfilled by several passive mechanical components. Several passive mechanical components were analyzed. It was determined that using a wrap spring clutch as the clutch and using a gas spring as the <b>torque</b> <b>generator</b> provides the required characteristics. This combination requires only a small actuator to lock and unlock the clutch. This combination also allows the restoration of energy during extension after it is stored during the resistance phases. This hardware combination results in a stance assistance knee exoskeleton which is relatively small, light and can further help reduce the metabolic cost associated with wearing an exoskeleton. A simplified controller was implemented to gauge system performance. Additional applications for the hardware architecture are proposed. These applications include use of the knee exoskeleton with a modular hip. The hardware is not limited to use as a knee exoskeleton. It can be used to reduce the erector spinae muscles forces in the back, if it is installed at the user's hip.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Subject-specific forward-dynamics simulation models of human movement incorporating torque generators have typically represented the torque at a joint based on the kinematics of only that joint. Representing the net torque exerted at a joint by considering the kinematics of two joints ought to better represent the torques exerted by the two-joint biarticular muscles. In this study two-joint <b>torque</b> <b>generator</b> representations including monoarticular and biarticular torque components and single-joint <b>torque</b> <b>generator</b> representation of the lower limb were determined for a single male participant using strength measurements collected on an isovelocity dynamometer. For plantar flexion, knee flexion, knee extension torques, a two-joint representation was found to offer better agreement with torques measured on an isovelocity dynamometer than a single joint representation when the joint angle of a secondary joint was changed by 37 ˚ or more. In addition a two-joint representation should account for the biarticular knee flexor and extensor contributions to hip joint torques. Two subject-specific simulation models of squat jumping, one with single-joint torque generators and another with two-joint torque generators were created to establish the necessity for two-joint torque representation in whole-body simulation models of human movement. Including the two-joint torque generators was shown to provide better agreement with a participant performance than a single-joint torque-driven simulation model. The simulation of a maximal effort human movement should include two-joint torque representations when both of the following characteristics {{are present in the}} task to be simulated: a) the task does not have a large initial whole-body momentum; b) the task involves multiple joint kinematics with a large biarticular muscle contribution.

The model consists of nine segments with three rotational degrees of freedom at the shoulder, two at the elbow, two at the wrist, three at the grip and two between the racket handle and racket head. Seven pairs of <b>torque</b> <b>generators</b> were used to control joint angle changes with each pair of <b>torque</b> <b>generators</b> representing the <b>torque</b> exerted by the corresponding agonist-antagonist muscles across a joint. The torque exerted during a simulation was determined by multiplying maximum voluntary torque and the corresponding torque activation level which was specified {{as a function of}} time using flexor and extensor torque activation profiles. The stringbed was represented by nine point masses connected to each other and the racket frame with elastic springs and three torsional springdampers between the hand and the racket were used to represent grip tightness. The model was designed so that the ball could contact the racket at any of the nine point mass locations and therefore allow simulations for different ball impact locations. The starting point of all simulations was a matched centre impact trial with all parameters in the model kept at the values used in the matching simulation apart from ball impact location. For each perturbation of ball impact location, simulations were run for a 50 ms period starting with ball-racket impact. The effect of ball impact location on the movement of the racket and wrist could be clearly grouped into three impact locations; above the longitudinal axis of the racket, on the longitudinal axis of the racket and below the longitudinal of the racket. Simulations showed that during off-centre impacts below the longitudinal axis of the racket, the wrist was forced to flex up to 16 ∘ more due to substantial racket rotation within the hand when compared to a matched centre impact simulation. As a consequence off-centre impacts below the longitudinal axis of the racket may be a substantial contributing factor for tennis elbow injuries due to forced wrist flexion and eccentric contraction of the wrist extensors...|$|R

Research in biomechanics tries to explain the functioning and design of real biological muscles and therefore lays the fundament for the development of functional artificial muscles. Recently, the hyperbolic Hill-type force-velocity relation was derived from simple mechanical components. In this contribution, this theoretical yet biomechanical model is transferred to a numerical model and applied for presenting a proof-of-concept of a functional artificial muscle. Additionally, this validated theoretical model is used to determine force-velocity relations of different animal species that are based on the literature data from biological experiments. Moreover, it is shown that an antagonistic muscle actuator can help in stabilising a single inverted pendulum model in favour of a control approach using a linear <b>torque</b> <b>generator.</b> 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{new model}} of the flagellar motor is {{proposed}} {{that is based on}} established dynamics of the KcsA potassium ion channel and on known genetic, biochemical, and biophysical facts, which accounts for the mechanics of torque generation, force transmission, and reversals of motor rotation. It predicts that proton (or in some species sodium ion) flow generates short, reversible helix rotations of the MotA-MotB channel complex (the stator) that are transmitted by Coulomb forces to the FliG segments at the rotor surface. Channels are arranged as symmetric pairs, S and T, that swing back and forth in synchrony. S and T alternate in attaching to the rotor, so that force transmission proceeds in steps. The sense of motor rotation can be readily reversed by conformationally switching the position of charged groups on the rotor so that they interact with the stator during the reverse rather than forward strokes. An elastic device accounts for the observed smoothness of rotation and a prolonged attachment of the <b>torque</b> <b>generators</b> to the rotor, i. e., a high duty ratio of each torque-generating unit...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an observer backstepping controller as feasible solution to {{variable speed control}} of wind turbines to maximize wind power capture when operating between cut-in and rated wind speeds. The wind turbine is modeled as a two-mass drive-train system controlled by the <b>generator</b> <b>torque.</b> The nonlinear controller aims at regulating the <b>generator</b> <b>torque</b> such that an optimal tip-speed ratio can be obtained. Simply relying on the measured rotor angular velocity the proposed observer backstepping controller guarantees global asymptotic tracking of the desired trajectory while maintaining a globally uniformly ultimately bounded torsional angle. The proposed controller shows convincing performance when simulated in closed loop within a stochastic environment...|$|R
