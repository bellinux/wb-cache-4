5|$|The MacBook Pro {{comes with}} the {{successor}} to BIOS, Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) 1.1. EFI handles booting differently from BIOS-based computers, but provides backwards compatibility, allowing dual and triple boot configurations. In addition to OS X, the Microsoft Windows operating system is installable on Intel x86-based Apple computers. Officially, this is limited to both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 with the necessary hardware drivers included with the Boot Camp software. Other x86 operating systems such as Linux are also unofficially supported.

25|$|Since the {{introduction}} of Windows Vista, most attempts at circumvention of product activation have focused on using leaked SLP product keys and BIOS information used by OEMs to preactivate Windows. In 2007, a circumvention measure was developed for Windows Vista by warez-group Paradox that simulates <b>the</b> <b>BIOS,</b> allowing leaked SLP information to be fed to the operating system, bypassing activation.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>BIOS</b> {{directly}} controlled hardware components {{other than}} the CPU and main memory. It contained functions such as character input and output and the reading and writing of disk sectors. The BDOS implemented the CP/M file system and some input/output abstractions (such as redirection) on top of <b>the</b> <b>BIOS.</b> The CCP took user commands and either executed them directly (internal commands such as DIR to show a directory or ERA to delete a file) or loaded and started an executable file of the given name (transient commands such as PIP.COM to copy files or STAT.COM to show various file and system information). Third-party applications for CP/M were also essentially transient commands.|$|E

25|$|When a PC {{is powered}} on its BIOS follows the {{configured}} boot {{order to find}} a bootable device. This can be a harddisk, floppy, CD/DVD, network connection, USB-device, etc. depending on <b>the</b> <b>BIOS.</b> In {{the case of a}} floppy <b>the</b> <b>BIOS</b> interprets its boot sector (first sector) as code, for NTLDR this could be a NTLDR boot sector looking for the ntldr file on the floppy. For a harddisk the code in the Master Boot Record (first sector) determines the active partition. The code in the boot sector of the active partition could then be again a NTLDR boot sector looking for ntldr in the root directory of this active partition. In a more convoluted scenario the active partition can contain a Vista boot sector for the newer Vista boot manager with an {ntldr} entry pointing to another partition with a NTLDR boot sector.|$|E
25|$|The first {{reserved}} sector (logical sector 0) is the Boot Sector (also called Volume Boot Record {{or simply}} VBR). It includes an area called <b>the</b> <b>BIOS</b> Parameter Block (BPB) which contains some basic file system information, in particular its type and pointers {{to the location}} of the other sections, and usually contains the operating system's boot loader code.|$|E
25|$|Customization was {{required}} because hardware choices were not constrained by compatibility with any one popular standard. For example, some manufacturers used separate computer terminal, while others designed a built-in integrated video display system. Serial ports for printers and modems could use {{different types of}} UART chips, and port addresses were not fixed. Some machines used memory-mapped I/O instead of the 8080 I/O address space. All of these variations in the hardware were concealed from other modules of the system by use of <b>the</b> <b>BIOS,</b> which used standard entry points for the services required to run CP/M such as character I/O or accessing a disk block. Since support for serial communication to a modem was very rudimentary in <b>the</b> <b>BIOS</b> or may have been absent altogether, it was common practice for CP/M programs that used modems to have a user-installed overlay containing all the code required to access a particular machine's serial port.|$|E

40|$|Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells {{generally}} cannot synthesize biotin, a vitamin {{required for}} many carboxylation reactions. Although sake yeasts, {{which are used}} for Japanese sake brewing, are classified as S. cerevisiae, they do not require biotin for their growth. In this study, we identified a novel open reading frame (ORF) in the genome of one strain of sake yeast that we speculated {{to be involved in}} biotin synthesis. Homologs of this gene are widely distributed in the genomes of sake yeasts. However, they are not found in many laboratory strains and strains used for wine making and beer brewing. This ORF was named BIO 6 because it has 52 % identity with BIO 3, a biotin biosynthesis gene of a laboratory strain. Further research showed that yeasts without <b>the</b> <b>BIO</b> 6 gene are auxotrophic for biotin, whereas yeasts holding <b>the</b> <b>BIO</b> 6 gene are prototrophic for biotin. <b>The</b> <b>BIO</b> 6 gene was disrupted in strain A 364 A, which is a laboratory strain with one copy of <b>the</b> <b>BIO</b> 6 gene. Although strain A 364 A is prototrophic for biotin, a BIO 6 disrupted mutant was found to be auxotrophic for biotin. <b>The</b> <b>BIO</b> 6 disruptant was able to grow in biotin-deficient medium supplemented with 7 -keto- 8 -amino-pelargonic acid (KAPA), while <b>the</b> <b>bio</b> 3 disruptant was not able to grow in this medium. These results suggest that Bio 6 p acts in an unknown step of biotin synthesis before KAPA synthesis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that expression of <b>the</b> <b>BIO</b> 6 gene, like that of other biotin synthesis genes, was upregulated by depletion of biotin. We conclude that <b>the</b> <b>BIO</b> 6 gene is a novel biotin biosynthesis gene of S. cerevisiae...|$|R

25|$|These {{included}} {{reading or}} writing single characters {{to the system}} console and reading or writing a sector of data from the disk. The BDOS handled some of the buffering of data from the diskette, but before CP/M 3.0 it assumed a disk sector size fixed at 128 bytes, as used on single-density 8-inch floppy disks. Since most 5.25-inch disk formats used larger sectors, the blocking and deblocking and the management of a disk buffer area was handled by model-specific code in <b>the</b> <b>BIOS.</b>|$|E

It was suggested that this was due to an under-valued capacitor in the power circuit. This problem appeared to be resolved in the 350-40, which had a different PSU.|$|E

25|$|By design, the 286 {{could not}} revert from {{protected}} mode {{to the basic}} 8086-compatible real address mode ("real mode") without a hardware-initiated reset.

(<b>The</b> <b>BIOS</b> is necessarily involved because it obtains control directly whenever the CPU resets.) Though it worked correctly, the method imposed a huge performance penalty.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of the complexity in CP/M was isolated in the BDOS, {{and to a lesser}} extent, the CCP and transient commands. This meant that by porting the limited number of simple routines in <b>the</b> <b>BIOS</b> to a particular hardware platform, the entire OS would work. This significantly reduced the development time needed to support new machines, {{and was one of the}} main reasons for CP/M's widespread use. Today this sort of abstraction is common to most OSs (a hardware abstraction layer), but at the time of CP/M's birth, OSs were typically intended to run on only one machine platform, and multilayer designs were considered unnecessary.|$|E
