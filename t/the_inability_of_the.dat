5|$|In May 1991, the Croatian National Guard (ZNG), {{subsequently}} {{renamed the}} Croatian Army (HV) in November, was {{formed as a}} result of growing support for the RSK from the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Croatian Police to cope with the situation.|$|E
5|$|Control of {{the growing}} {{tensions}} became hampered by increasing support of SAO Krajina being provided by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA). <b>The</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Croatian Police {{to cope with the}} situation led to the establishment of the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) in May 1991. However, the development of the ZNG into a military force was hampered by a UN arms embargo, introduced in September, while the military conflict in Croatia continued to escalate—the Battle of Vukovar started on 26 August.|$|E

5|$|Haydock also {{considered}} a {{theme in the}} film to be <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church to fulfill individual spiritual needs.

5|$|The 27th Regiment became {{locked in}} fierce {{fighting}} with the Partisan 27th East Bosnia Division and 38th Bosnia Division, which had launched an offensive near Vlasenica. <b>The</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 27th Regiment to push forward meant that the plan to encircle the Partisan force was not achieved and the Partisans escaped by crossing the Vlasenica–Han Pijesak road to the east.

5|$|The {{economy of}} the small island of Cyprus with 840,000 people was hit by several huge blows in and around 2012 including, amongst other things, the €22 billion {{exposure}} of Cypriot banks to the Greek debt haircut, the downgrading of the Cypriot economy into junk status by international rating agencies and <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government to refund its state expenses.|$|E
5|$|The {{next major}} Japanese {{reinforcement}} effort failed during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, undertaken as Shōji and his troops struggled to reach friendly lines near the Matanikau.

5|$|During the {{preceding}} Tang dynasty, {{the civil service}} examinations did not yet produce {{the high number of}} officials as they would during the Song dynasty; a hereditary aristocracy remained dependent on the court for attaining rank and holding office. Song rulers, particularly Emperor Huizong, encountered a great deal of political opposition despite attempts to attain the ideals of the sage kings of antiquity. <b>The</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sovereign to monopolize political authority was linked to the rise of a new class of gentry and scholar-official who filled the bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|In 1495 the Italian Renaissance {{arrived in}} France, {{imported}} by King Charles VIII after his invasion of Italy. A factor that promoted {{the spread of}} secularism was <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church to offer assistance against the Black Death. Francis I imported Italian art and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, and built ornate palaces at great expense.

5000|$|As {{the discussions}} on <b>the</b> {{doctrine}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Messiah continued, Astruc HaLevi {{emphasized that the}} word [...] "messiah" [...] in its Jewish and Christian meanings is completely different. Thus, he said, {{there is no difference}} of opinion between Jews and Christians over <b>the</b> question <b>of</b> his coming, rather the debate is over what a messiah really is. Afterwards, he nullified <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> debate. A failure in the debate cannot prove <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> faith, but only <b>the</b> <b>inabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arguer.

40|$|Ricoeur’s phenomenological hermeneutics can be {{understood}} as an anthropological hermeneutics of l’homme capable: As the human person I can speak, I can narrate, I can act, and I can feel responsible. <b>The</b> fundamental capabilities/incapabilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human person are linked to their corresponding vulnerabilities. As existing and inhabiting the world, the human person is also l’homme faillible by virtue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very nature <b>of</b> being a human being. The fallibility, weakness, and suffering describe <b>the</b> <b>inabilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capable person. Ricoeur’s anthropology develops as the transition from is <b>the</b> phenomenology <b>of</b> a suffering human being toward <b>the</b> phenomenological hermeneutics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capable person. Any account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human person will be always provisional, partial, and incomplete because we are finite human beings...|$|R
5|$|On {{an early}} test run the R engine {{produced}} 1,400hp (1,040kW) and was noted to idle happily at 450revolutions per minute (rpm). With increased boost ratings and fuel developed by Banks, the R engine ultimately developed 2,530hp (1,890kW) at 3,200rpm; well over double the maximum power {{output of the}} Buzzard. The engine was further tested and cleared for limited sprint racing at 2,783hp (2,075kW) at 3,400rpm and +21lb (1.45bar) of boost, but this capability was not used due to concerns with the S.6B's airframe {{not being able to}} withstand the power, and <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft to lift the extra fuel required to meet the increased consumption.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} of the Ottoman fleet could not be concealed from foreign observers, which {{proved to be an}} embarrassment for the government and finally forced Abdul Hamid II to authorize a modernization program, which recommended that the ironclads be modernized in foreign shipyards. German firms, including Krupp, Schichau-Werke, and AG Vulcan, were to rebuild the ships, but after having surveyed the ships, withdrew from the project in December 1897 owing to the impracticality of modernizing the ships and <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman government to pay for the work. By 1900, the contracts were finally awarded, and Necm-i Şevket {{was not included in the}} program.

5|$|The {{submarines}} {{have been}} the subject of many incidents and technical problems since the design phase, including accusations of foul play and bias during the design selection, improper handling of design changes during construction, major capability deficiencies in the first submarines, and ongoing technical problems throughout the early life of the class. These problems have been compounded by <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RAN to retain sufficient personnel to operate the submarines—by 2008, only three could be manned, and between 2009 and 2012, on average two or fewer were fully operational.

5|$|Allied armies {{had also}} reached the pre-war German {{territorial}} borders and now occupied some German towns and cities.

The Kammhuber Line—German air defence system—which had extended through occupied France, Belgium and the Netherlands was now broken and much of its early warning network had been lost. Along with the battlefield reverses was <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe to produce enough experienced night fighter crews which was exacerbated by the crippling shortage of fuel {{at this stage in}} the war which contributed to the collapse of training programs and grounded combat units.

5|$|In 2036, FBI Agents Simon Foster (Henry Ian Cusick) and Henrietta 'Etta' Bishop (Georgina Haig) {{recover the}} body of Walter Bishop (John Noble), Walter having purposefully encased himself and his team in amber shortly after the Observer takeover. Though {{they are able to}} release him from the amber, they find that he has {{suffered}} memory damage and lacks the mental capacity to build a strange device of his own design. Simon and Etta talk to Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), learning that Walter had William Bell remove a piece of his brain some time in the past, which she postulates could be used to heal Walter's brain now. However, the piece is still in storage in the old Massive Dynamic facility on the main island of New York City, tightly controlled by Observers who can read their thoughts, making its recovery difficult. They are able {{to make it to the}} vault in Massive Dynamic, in part due to <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Observers to read Etta's mind, and successfully restore Walter's memories. They are, however, unaware that they have alerted Fringe division—still led by Agent Broyles (Lance Reddick)—and the Observers to their presence; a coordinated team, instructed to shoot on sight, is dispatched.|$|E
5|$|On 31 October 1918, {{at the end}} of World War I and the {{dissolution}} of Austria-Hungary, the majority of the area was taken over by local Polish authorities supported by armed forces. The interim agreement of 2 November 1918 reflected <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two national councils to come to final delimitation. On 5 November 1918, the area was divided between Poland and Czechoslovakia by an interim agreement of two local self-government councils (Czech Zemský národní výbor pro Slezsko and Polish Rada Narodowa Księstwa Cieszyńskiego). Before that, the majority of the area was taken over by Polish local authorities. In 1919 both councils were absorbed by the newly created and independent central governments in Prague and Warsaw.
