40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 42 - 45) This {{study investigated}} the effect of <b>symbol</b> <b>tracking</b> training on figure-ground perception. Attneave's (1971) theory concerning the multistability of figure-ground perception {{was the basis for}} the belief that figure-ground perception might be particularly vulnerable to <b>symbol</b> <b>tracking</b> training. The literature indicated disagreement regarding the definition of perception and its relationship to other functions. Reports were contradictory regarding the effectiveness of visual training on both perception and reading. The following three hypotheses were analyzed: 1. There will be a significant difference (p <. 05) in the mean scores of the Southern California Figure-Ground Visual Perception Test (SCFGVPT) by Ayres between pretest and posttest scores of an experimental group who have received training in <b>symbol</b> <b>tracking.</b> 2. There will not be a significant difference (p <. 05) in the mean scores of the SCFGVPT between pretest and posttest scores of a control group who have not received training in <b>symbol</b> <b>tracking.</b> 3. There will be a significant difference (p<. 05) in the mean scores between posttest scores of an experimental group who have received training in <b>symbol</b> <b>tracking</b> and posttest scores of a control group who have not received training in <b>symbol</b> <b>tracking.</b> South Park Elementary School, a Title One school in the Los Angeles" Unified School District, was chosen as the site for the study. Sixty second-grade students were selected. Thirty subjects were designated as the experimental group and 30 Ss as the control group.

During an eight-week period the experimental group was given training in <b>symbol</b> <b>tracking</b> using the Michigan <b>Tracking</b> Program: <b>Symbol</b> <b>Tracking</b> Workbook, Figure-ground perceptual ability was retested.

40|$|This study investigates dynamic 3 D target acquisition. The {{focus is}} on the {{relative}} effect of specific perceptual cues. A novel technique is introduced and we report on an experiment that evaluates its effectiveness. There are two aspects to the new technique. First, in contrast to normal practice, the <b>tracking</b> <b>symbol</b> is a volume rather than a point. Second, the surface of this volume is semi-transparent, thereby affording occlusion cues during target acquisition. The experiment shows that the volume/occlusion cues were effective in both monocular and stereoscopic conditions. For some tasks where stereoscopic presentation is unavailable or infeasible, the new technique offers an effective alternative.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The {{purpose was}} to study the effects on the nervous system in welders exposed to {{aluminium}} and manganese. METHODS [...] The investigation included questionnaires on symptoms, psychological methods (simple reaction time, finger tapping speed and endurance, digit span, vocabulary, <b>tracking,</b> <b>symbol</b> digit, cylinders, olfactory threshold, Luria-Nebraska motor scale), neurophysiological methods (electroencephalography, event related auditory evoked potential (P- 300), brainstem auditory evoked potential, and diadochokinesometry) and assessments of blood and urine concentrations of metals (aluminium, lead, and manganese). RESULTS [...] The welders exposed to aluminium (n = 38) reported more symptoms from {{the central nervous system}} than the control group (n = 39). They also had a decreased motor function in five tests. The effect was dose related in two of these five tests. The median exposure of aluminium welders was 7065 hours and they had about seven times higher concentrations of aluminium in urine than the controls. The welders exposed to manganese (n = 12) had a decreased motor function in five tests. An increased latency of event related auditory evoked potential was also found in this group. The median manganese exposure was 270 hours. These welders did not have higher concentrations of manganese in blood than the controls. CONCLUSIONS [...] The neurotoxic effects found in the groups of welders exposed to aluminium and manganese are probably caused by the aluminium and manganese exposure, respectively. These effects indicate a need for improvements in the work environments of these welders...|$|E

This recursive approach, EM-SD, could be viewed as the Kalman filter with soft decision feedback. A soft sphere decoder with soft interference cancelation was proposed to lower the complexity of the BCJR algorithm when large input signal constellation was used.; Second, a complete solution to joint channel <b>tracking</b> and <b>symbol</b> detection for bit-interleaved MIMO-OFDM systems in a time-varying frequency-selective fading environment is proposed in this research. In the training mode, the Rao-Blackwellised particle filter (RBPF) is used to estimate the phase offset (PO) and the carrier frequency offset (CFO). The EM-SD algorithm is then applied in data mode to perform the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimation and the maximum a posterior (MAP) probability symbol detection jointly.; Finally, feedback-directed adaptive scheme is shown to achieve the same pre-log factor of the lower bound of the noncoherent capacity of MIMO-OFDM systems in ergodic channels. It also has the same tradeoff of diversity and multiplexing gain as the MIMO systems employed with random Gaussian codewords in nonergodic channels. It is shown that throughput of OFDMA with opportunistic scheduling performs better than traditional OFDM-TDMA scheduling with constant enhancement independent of SNR in multiuser downlink environment...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new joint channel <b>tracking</b> and <b>symbol</b> {{detection}} scheme for pilot symbol-assisted OFDM systems in multipath fading. The proposed scheme uses Kalman filters for both channel tracking and subsequent equalization which are combined in the coupled estimator structure. Modelling the multipath fading channel as random processes to describe channel variations {{in a general}} AR framework lends itself to a state-space representation that enables the application of Kalman filtering for the tracking of channel variations. However, the proposed tracking algorithm requires knowledge of the transmitted symbols. This implies that an iterative method should be sought to obtain alternatively either channel or transmitted symbols. To compose the coupled estimator structure, a linear Kalman filter equalizer with the corresponding state-space model is therefore proposed {{for the detection of}} transmitted symbols. With the proposed Kalman filters, iterative structure is utilized to decode transmitted symbols and subsequently to track channel parameters. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is investigated through the experimental results. Publisher's Versio...|$|R
