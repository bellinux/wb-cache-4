5|$|Another {{factor in}} Wallace's <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> his belief that, {{because of the}} action of natural selection, organisms were {{in a state of}} balance with their environment, and that {{everything}} in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results. Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.|$|E

50|$|<b>Thinking</b> <b>is</b> {{more than}} just conceiving ideas and drawing inferences; <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> also {{reflection}} and contemplation. When we take embodied thinking rather than abstract reasoning as a goal for our mind, then we understand that <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> a transformative act. The mind will not only deduce, speculate, and comprehend, {{but it will also}} awaken, will enlighten and inspire. Si, is how I have thought, and always will think.|$|R
5|$|To begin with, {{the number}} of the party members is {{extremely}} large. Millions of people believed in the National Socialist philosophy; they were influenced by the broadcasts of the Führer and the detailed party propaganda. Individual <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> switched off, and the party members allowed their leaders to set the guidelines in everything for them--and this spread throughout the entire population. In this way, more fanatics were created who were ready to use brute force, and other means of terror, to eliminate any internal resistance.|$|E
5|$|Weber's <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> {{strongly}} influenced by German idealism and particularly by neo-Kantianism, {{to which he had}} been exposed through Heinrich Rickert, his professorial colleague at the University of Freiburg. Especially important to Weber's work is the neo-Kantian belief that reality is essentially chaotic and incomprehensible, with all rational order deriving from {{the way in which the}} human mind focuses its attention on certain aspects of reality and organises the resulting perceptions. Weber's opinions regarding the methodology of the social sciences show parallels with the work of contemporary neo-Kantian philosopher and pioneering sociologist Georg Simmel.|$|E
5|$|Romantic <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> {{also evident}} in the {{writings}} of Hugh Miller, stonemason and geologist, who followed in the tradition of Naturphilosophie, arguing that nature was a pre-ordained progression towards the human race. Publisher, historian, antiquarian and scientist Robert Chambers (1802–71) became a friend of Scott, writing a biography of him after the author's death. Chambers also became a geologist, researching in Scandinavia and Canada. His most influential work was the anonymously published Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844), which was the most comprehensive written argument in favour of evolution before the work of Charles Darwin (1809–82). His work was strongly influenced by transcendental anatomy, which, drawing on Goethe and Lorenz Oken (1779–1851), looked for ideal patterns and structure in nature and had been pioneered in Scotland by figures including Robert Knox (1791–1862).|$|E

In general parallel <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> a further development of the well known lateral thinking processes, focusing even more on explorations—looking for what can be rather than for what is.|$|R

Engineering design <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> “a complex cognitive process” including divergence–convergence, a systems perspective, ambiguity, and collaboration (Dym, Agogino, Eris, Frey, & Leifer, 2005, p. 104).

25|$|In a 1995 {{edition of}} Hirsch' Nineteen Letters, {{commentator}} Rabbi Joseph Elias makes an extensive effort to show Hirsch' sources in Rabbinic literature, parallels {{in his other}} works {{and those of other}} post-Talmudic Jewish thinkers.

25|$|The new government's {{strategic}} <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> sharply divided. Pitt {{had been}} a long-term advocate of Britain playing as small a role on the European continent while concentrating their resources and naval power to strike against vulnerable French colonies. Newcastle remained an old-school continentalist—who believed that the war would be decided in Europe, and was convinced that a strong British presence there was essential. He was supported in this view by George II.|$|E
50|$|Psychologists {{have found}} that a high IQ alone does not {{guarantee}} creativity. Instead, personality traits that promote divergent <b>thinking</b> <b>are</b> more important.

40|$|Abstract: Systems <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> an inquiry-based {{method of}} {{learning}} that uses the technique of perspective-taking, fosters holistic thinking, and engages in belief-testing.

Results suggest that systems <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> well suited for this purpose...|$|R

25|$|His {{writings}} on politics, law, art, and culture emphasized the positive {{element of the}} spiritual and secular unification of Russia with the acceptance of Christianity. He warned of the negative element in Russia, portraying democratic and liberal movements as enemies of the national and religious unity of Russian people. Achieving a harmonious society, said Pobedonostsev, meant there was a collective responsibility to uphold political and religious unity, hence close supervision of Russian behaviour and <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> a necessity.|$|E
25|$|In February 1919, Briggs {{began to}} change his ideas, and his new <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> {{expressed}} in articles in the Crusader. He began to draw parallels between the plight of black workers in the United States and impoverished working class whites, who were mostly recent immigrants or their descendants from Europe. Over ensuing months, Briggs began to consider the system of capitalism as the villain, and he argued {{in favor of a}} common cause and common action by workers of all races.|$|E
25|$|The {{background}} of my early <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> a German home {{in which the}} ideals of the revolution of 1848 were a living force. My father, liberal, but not active in public affairs; my mother, idealistic, with a lively interest in public matters; the founder about 1854 of the kindergarten in my home town, devoted to science. My parents had broken through the shackles of dogma. My father had retained an emotional affection for the ceremonial of his parental home, without allowing it to influence his intellectual freedom.|$|E

5000|$|Stochastic <b>thinking</b> may <b>be</b> {{looked upon}} as the {{opposite}} of causal thinking; however, the term stochastic <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> rather ambiguous, because the meaning of stochastics is not clear.

Here stochastic <b>thinking</b> <b>is</b> explained in the sense of Bernoulli stochastics.|$|R
25|$|Beveridge saw full {{employment}} (defined as unemployment {{of no more}} than 3%) as the pivot of the social welfare programme he expressed in the 1942 report. Full Employment in a Free Society, written in 1944 expressed how this goal might be gained. Alternative measures for achieving it included Keynesian-style fiscal regulation, direct control of manpower, and state control of the means of production. The impetus behind Beveridge's <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> social justice, and the creation of an ideal new society after the war. He believed that the discovery of objective socio-economic laws could solve the problems of society.|$|E
25|$|A {{study by}} {{psychologist}} J. Philippe Rushton found creativity to correlate with intelligence and psychoticism. Another study found creativity {{to be greater}} in schizotypal than in either normal or schizophrenic individuals. While divergent <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> associated with bilateral activation of the prefrontal cortex, schizotypal individuals {{were found to have}} much greater activation of their right prefrontal cortex. This study hypothesizes that such individuals are better at accessing both hemispheres, allowing them to make novel associations at a faster rate. In agreement with this hypothesis, ambidexterity is also associated with schizotypal and schizophrenic individuals. Three recent studies by Mark Batey and Adrian Furnham have demonstrated the relationships between schizotypal and hypomanic personality and several different measures of creativity.|$|E
25|$|The {{major shift}} in medical <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> the gradual rejection, {{especially}} during the Black Death in the 14th and 15th centuries, {{of what may be}} called the 'traditional authority' approach to science and medicine. This was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so, then that was the way it was, and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly (which was paralleled by a similar shift in European society in general – see Copernicus's rejection of Ptolemy's theories on astronomy). Physicians like Vesalius improved upon or disproved some of the theories from the past. The main tomes used both by medicine students and expert physicians were Materia Medica and Pharmacopoeia.|$|E

25|$|The Pope had {{appointed}} Carlo Maderno in 1602. He was {{a nephew}} of Domenico Fontana and had demonstrated {{himself as a}} dynamic architect. Maderno's idea was to ring Michelangelo's building with chapels, but the Pope was hesitant about deviating from the master's plan, {{even though he had}} been dead for forty years. The Fabbrica or building committee, a group drawn from various nationalities and generally despised by the Curia who viewed the basilica as belonging to Rome rather than Christendom, were in a quandary as to how the building should proceed. One of the matters that influenced their <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> the Counter-Reformation which increasingly associated a Greek Cross plan with paganism and saw the Latin Cross as truly symbolic of Christianity.|$|E
25|$|In {{his work}} on the history of religion, Eliade is most highly {{regarded}} for his writings on Alchemy, Shamanism, Yoga and what he called the eternal return—the implicit belief, supposedly present in religious thought in general, that religious behavior is not only an imitation of, but also a participation in, sacred events, and thus restores the mythical time of origins. Eliade's <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> in part influenced by Rudolf Otto, Gerardus van der Leeuw, Nae Ionescu and the writings of the Traditionalist School (René Guénon and Julius Evola). For instance, Eliade's The Sacred and the Profane partially builds on Otto's The Idea of the Holy to show how religion emerges from the experience of the sacred, and myths of time and nature.|$|E
25|$|One {{concern of}} the pilots was that no {{airfield}} then in existence, in their view, could safely take an eight-ton aircraft. They also objected {{to the use of}} Hornet engines, because most pilots were accustomed to the less-powerful Wasps and would find Hornets overpowering. Pratt & Whitney's chief engineer, George Mead, knew that this <b>thinking</b> <b>was</b> misguided and that within a few years it would seem antiquated. P's president, Frederick Rentschler, faced with a tough decision, decided to acquiesce to the airline pilots' unanimous demand. The decision created a rift between Mead and Rentschler. Despite the bitter disagreements on design and engines, the 247 was still a remarkable achievement and was Boeing's showcase exhibit at the 1933 Chicago World's Fair.|$|E
