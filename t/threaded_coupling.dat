40|$|Supporting dynamic {{parallelism}} {{is important}} for GPU to benefit {{a broad range of}} applications. There are cur-rently two fundamental ways for programs to exploit dy-namic parallelism on GPU: a software-based approach with software-managed worklists, and a hardware-based approach through dynamic subkernel launches. Neither is satisfactory. The former is complicated to program and is often subject to some load imbalance; the latter su↵ers large runtime overhead. In this work, we propose free launch, a new software approach to overcoming the shortcomings of both meth-ods. It allows programmers to use subkernel launches to express dynamic parallelism. It employs a novel compiler-based code transformation named subkernel launch removal to replace the subkernel launches with the reuse of parent <b>threads.</b> <b>Coupled</b> with an adaptive task assignment mechanism, the transformation reas-signs the tasks in the subkernels to the parent threads with a good load balance.

An annular compression ring with a tapered internal bore surface is arranged about the cannula with the tapered internal surface in a facing relationship to the external tapered surface. The angle of inclination of the tapered surfaces is converging such that the spacing between the tapered surfaces decreases {{from one end of the}} external tapered surface to the other end thereby providing a clamping action of the tapered surface on a cannula which increases as a function of the length of cannula segment between the tapered surfaces.

The calculations investigated three sucker rod sizes and various combinations of the slimhole, Spiralock, and Flexbar modifications to the coupling. In addition, the effect of various make-ups (assembly tightness) on the performance of coupling was investigated. An axial load was applied to the sucker rod ranging from {minus} 5 ksi to 40 ksi, encompassing three load cycles identified on a modified Goodman diagram as acceptable for indefinite service life of the sucker rods. The simulations of the various coupling geometries and make-ups were evaluated with respect to how well they accomplish the two primary objectives of preloading threaded couplings: (1) to lock the <b>threaded</b> <b>coupling</b> together so that it will not loosen and eventually uncouple, and (2) to improve the fatigue resistance of the threaded connection by reducing the stress amplitude in the coupling when subjected to cyclic loading. Perhaps the most significant finding in this study was the characterization of the coupling parameters which affect two stress measures. The mean hydrostatic stress, which determines the permissible effective alternating stress, {{is a function of the}} coupling make-up. Whereas, the alternating effective stress is a function of the relative stiffnesses of the pin and box sections of the coupling and, as long as the coupling does not separate, is unaffected by the amount of circumferential displacement applied during make-up.

40|$|Threaded {{connections}} are responsible assemblies, defining sucker rod string reliability. Despite {{the variety of}} their design, industrial materials analysis shows that breakages occur in rod body and threaded connections. In the process of lowering and lifting operations, aimed at well pump replacement, screwing and unscrewing of sucker rods threaded joints is repeated, so pin threads and couplings are worn. After analyzing the method of pin threads wear determining while screwing, unscrewing, connection and breakout sucker rods tightening, proposed by S. A. Babayan, {{it has been found}} out that the amount of thread wear during the makeup is 20 30 times greater than thread wear while fastening. According to this method the last three threads are practically unworn and deterioration of the first coil is 10 - 12 times greater than the wear of the last turns. The results of calculation correspond with the wear data in the course of sucker rods operation in an industrial environment. To identify and compare the distribution of stresses in the sucker rods threaded connections using the developed computer ANSYS, finite element axisymmetric models of new and worn standard threaded connections with a diameter of 19 mm have been created. Screw connections were loaded by axial force and torque make-up. Having analyzed the simulation results we have made a conclusion that with the increase of sucker rod wear, stress distribution in pin thread becomes uniform, respectively, it has positive effect on the threaded connection durability under cyclic dynamic loads. With further deterioration, thread tensions are rising in the middle turns, and in extreme turns - are reduced, so the impact of further deterioration on the connection durability is negative. Also it have been found that at the limit thread wear maximum stresses are concentrated in the <b>thread</b> <b>coupling,</b> resulting in the fracture of its body...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{paradigm}} of cloud computing has emerged as an architecture for computing that makes use of distributed (networked) computing resources. In this paper, we consider a distributed computing algorithmic scheme for stochastic optimization which relies on modest communication requirements amongst processors and most importantly, does not require synchronization. Specifically, we analyze a scheme with $N> 1 $ independent threads implementing each a stochastic gradient algorithm. The <b>threads</b> are <b>coupled</b> via a perturbation of the gradient (with attractive and repulsive forces) {{in a similar manner}} to mathematical models of flocking, swarming and other group formations found in nature with mild communication requirements. When the objective function is convex, we show that a flocking-like approach for distributed stochastic optimization provides a noise reduction effect similar to that of a centralized stochastic gradient algorithm based upon the average of $N$ gradient samples at each step. The distributed nature of flocking makes it an appealing computational alternative. We show that when the overhead related to the time needed to gather $N$ samples and synchronization is not negligible, the flocking implementation outperforms a centralized stochastic gradient algorithm based upon the average of $N$ gradient samples at each step. When the objective function is not convex, the flocking-based approach seems better suited to escape locally optimal solutions due to the repulsive force which enforces a certain level of diversity in the set of candidate solutions. Here again, we show that the noise reduction effect is similar to that associated to the centralized stochastic gradient algorithm based upon the average of $N$ gradient samples at each step.
