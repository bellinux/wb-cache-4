A new Aeromatic variable pitch prop is fitted, the only one available in the warehouse. On 28 June he leaves for Catania and on the 30th flies to Palermo.

One thing they do to accomplices this is <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> drift ferries to cable ferries. In 2010, the Vectura Consulting AB, designed a ferry berth at Hemsö for a cable ferry, commissioned by the Swedish Transport Administration. A CAD software used to design the ramp and ferry flap to pass the set-up requirements for buses clearance. Working methodology proved to be both time-consuming and difficult. This thesis is about to check whether the place molded convex concrete ramp, which was designed are a good solution for ferry berths with extreme water level differences. In addition a program is developed for solving the geometric problem. The program analyzes the problem in two dimensions, x and y direction. The program is developed in MatLab and a non-linear solution method has been used. Using the program, a locally optimal solution is found in about one day when the variables are given, compared with about a week of work with a CAD program. A comparison has been made between the projected solution to Hemsö and the solution offered by the program. The program's solution was better based on the conditions set out in this thesis. The prerequisites were however changed {{at the last moment}} for the design of Hemsö which may make the comparison a little misleading. For buses (type vehicles) tested in the program, it was difficult to find a design solution with a convex situ concrete ramp when the difference in water levels is very large. It’s a very unstable solution that should be planned with caution. As each small change in clearance requirements or design prototype vehicle has great influence on the ramp geometry. The final solution can be used when the water level difference is about 0. 7 m from minimum to maximum water levels for the design vehicl...|$|E

40|$|The {{low-speed}} aerodynamic {{performance characteristics}} of two advanced counterrotation pusher-propeller configurations with cruise design Mach numbers of 0. 72 were investigated in the NASA Lewis 9 - by 15 -Foot Low-Speed Wind Tunnel.

The investigation determined the effect of nonuniform inflow on <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> performance characteristics for several blade angle settings and a range of rotational speeds. The inflow was varied by yawing <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> mode to angle-of-attack by as much as plus or minus 16 degrees and by installing on <b>the</b> counterrotation <b>propeller</b> test rig near <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> rotors a model simulator of an aircraft engine support pylon and fuselage.

40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of the study is}} in {{transient}} torque vibration due to ice excitation on propulsion machinery components but some background for ice class rules is also presented generally. It is studied how the ice classification calculation process for propeller units could be done more automatically and how sensitive the process is to different parameters. Additionally aspects of the upcoming rule updates are discussed. These updates try to harmonize the ice class calculations internationally and bring out alternatives for the calculation process. As a part of this study partly automated calculation process was developed with Matlab as a sales team tool to ease the preliminary calculations that have to be made during the sales offer. The program includes simulation of a thruster unit and gear calculations based on the given input parameters. This kind of a tool is needed because the offered thruster needs to be classified accordingly and on the current rules this is the safest way to ensure that the offered values can be achieved. The program was developed for a single thruster unit using Finnish-Swedish ice class rules and marine gear rating rules. First in the program ice class excitation loads are calculated and simulated. Then the gears are evaluated to find out validity of power for the chosen thruster unit. This program can be applied to other units as well by making <b>the</b> necessary <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> unit’s simulation model and by changing the mass-elastic data. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted for Rolls-Royce US 305 azimuthing thruster unit. The results showed that the most critical factor is the gear design itself because it needs to be optimized for heavy loads and the current designs are based on the free running conditions. Other design factors influence the resulting maximum power as well and may have significance cumulatively but otherwise their effect is minimal compared to the gears. Flexible coupling is also quite critical component because of the damping properties and its effect on systems nominal frequencies. Higher power can be achieved by choosing a lower inertia engine or motor and choosing a lower input speed. Additionally propeller design parameters like pitch have some effects but the most important factor is the choice between open and ducted propeller. Open propellers have notably higher loads than ducted in the rules. Other important factor in the design is <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> diameter, bigger diameter increases the ice load...|$|R

5000|$|New planes {{outdated}} the Torpedo Mark 13, but drag {{rings and}} stabilizers renewed its usefulness. Throughout 1943 torpedo performance remained poor, but {{the following year}} witnessed {{a revolution in the}} behavior of the Mark 13. Minor <b>changes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>propeller</b> blades and a reduction in gyro damage helped, but the greatest improvement resulted from the stabilizing effects of two appendages--the drag ring and the shroud ring.The first assembly, known familiarly as the pickle barrel, was readied for use by 1944. Early experiments with parachutes attached to aircraft torpedoes had demonstrated that a drag had a beneficial effect on the airflight characteristics of the weapon. While parachutes did not appear be the solution to the problem, discovery of the principle involved {{led to the development of}} the drag ring. Constructed of plywood, the ring was attached to the head of a torpedo and served as a stabilizer for the period that the weapon was airborne. Oscillations were reduced and the ring effected a 40 percent deceleration in air speed, then acted as a shock absorber when the torpedo struck water. Better water entry, a byproduct of air stabilization, reduced damage so substantially that pilots were able to increase the heights and speeds at which torpedoes were released.The drag ring went a long way toward making the Mark 13 a reliable torpedo, but underwater performance still called for improvement. By midsummer 1944, however, the shroud ring developed by the California Institute of Technology completed the torpedo revolution that had seemed so remote the year before. Almost an exact duplicate of an assembly developed by Newport in 1871, the shroud ring was made to fit over the tail blades of the torpedo. Known to pilots as the ring tail, it produced a steady water run by reducing hooks and broaches and eliminating much of the water roll which characterized the Mark 13. Speed and range were reduced but slightly. Early tests showed that ring-tailed torpedoes took too deep an initial dive, but readjustments of controls soon remedied that last obstacle. Hot, straight, and normal runs approached 100 percent, and the once critical battle reports soon became enthusiastic in praise of the Mark 13. Even psychologically, the appendages contributed to success,since the external design of the torpedo equipped with a pickle barrel and ring tail and the improved appearance of its underwater travel caught the fancy of the airmen.To speed the availability of the modified torpedo the Bureau built tail assemblies with the shroud ring attached, then sent them to the fleet as substitutes for the equipment on hand. By the fall of 1944 the revamped weapon had a wide distribution. As a result of the new improvements, torpedo drops at altitudes up to 800 feet and at speeds up to 300 knots were authorized. Experience soon indicated that these limits could be extended even further. On one occasion in early 1945, 6 Mark 13 torpedoes were released from altitudes between 5000 and 7000 feet; 5 out of the 6 were observed to run hot, straight, and normal. Combat use increased rapidly and the new effectiveness seemed out of all proportion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> made. On one air strike on April 7, 1945. Mark 13's sent to the bottom the 45,000 ton (sic) battleship Yamato, a light cruiser, and several destroyers. Months before the end of the war the Mark 13 was universally accepted as the best aircraft torpedo owned by any nation.|$|R
