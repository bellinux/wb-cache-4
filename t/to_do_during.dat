5|$|Jim's plan {{to drive}} home from Philadelphia to see his {{daughter}} CeCe's ballet recital hits a snag when a major investor says he is backing out. Jim asks his wife Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) to record the recital with her phone, which she agrees <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>During</b> {{the opening of the}} recital, she stops recording to take a phone call informing her that she has been chosen to paint an important public mural. In her excitement, she messes up the recording and fails to record any of CeCe's appearance. Jim calls her that evening to tell her the investor backed out, and his group will have to work long hours to make up the lost funds. He asks her to send him her recording of the recital as a way to cheer him up, and Pam confesses that she did not tape it. She tries to make light of the mishap by making self-deprecating remarks and pointing out that they can get recordings of the recital from other attendees, but he becomes frustrated at her, scolding her and starting a fight over his new job, the time he spends away from the family, and the sacrifices they are making to get their new life to work. After he hangs up, Pam breaks down in tears. A previously unseen boom operator named Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos) enters into the shot and comforts her, and tells the crew to stop filming.|$|E

25|$|Vigorous {{opposition}} to the occupation continued, nevertheless, and after World War I it increased in the U.S. as well. There, President Warren G. Harding (1921–23), Wilson's successor, worked {{to put an end}} to the occupation, as he had promised <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>during</b> his campaign. The U.S. government's rule ended in October 1922, and elections were held in March 1924.|$|E

25|$|Gregory also {{mandated}} {{a number}} of practices within the Church. He decreed that in Lent, on the Thursdays, people should fast, {{just as they were}} required <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>during</b> the other days of the week. Apparently the practice had been frowned upon by popes of previous centuries, as pagans had fasted on Thursday as part of their worship of Jupiter. He also prescribed the offices to be said during church services on Thursdays in Lent, as prior to this, the Mass of the preceding Sunday was said on those Thursdays.|$|E
25|$|Gear sets may be {{replaced}} with closer ratios to keep the engine in the power band, or, on some cars that produce enough power and torque to four-gear transmissions {{similar to the ones}} used in NASCAR (such as the Andrews four-speed dog box that Vaughn Gittin Jr. ran in his 2016 Mustang) with more open-ratio gears, this limits the number of shifts the driver has <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>during</b> their run. These may be coarser dog engagement straight cut gears instead of synchronised helical gears, for durability and faster shifting at the expense of noise and refinement. Wealthier drifters may use sequential gearboxes to make gear selection easier and faster, while sequential shift lever adapters {{can be used to make}} shifts easier without increasing shift time.|$|E
25|$|Lloyd's second {{stint in}} WCW {{was when he}} was booked to be {{defeated}} by The Great Muta at a house show in Atlanta. Following that match, at Muta's request, Lloyd joined Muta on a string of WCW house shows before he moved to Japan in 1993. He joined the UWFI as a guest of shootfighter Nobuhiko Takada, and competed against Japanese and American fighters. Lloyd returned to the United States after UWFI folded in 1996, and during a conversation with friend Diamond Dallas Page, he mentioned that he was planning to integrate martial arts into his wrestling, which he had been unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>during</b> the early days of his career. At Page's request, WCW president Eric Bischoff, a martial arts practitioner himself, met with Lloyd for three hours and signed him to a contract.|$|E

25|$|Rolf {{served on}} Murray's {{transition}} team following his successful bid for Mayor of Seattle in 2013, {{and was named}} co-chair of the 23-person Income Inequality Advisory Committee, which addresses minimum wage and other social issues. In late December 2013, Murray announced plans to increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour, which he had pledged <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>during</b> his election campaign, earning him an endorsement from Local 775 of SEIU. Simultaneously, Rolf was working alongside newly elected Seattle City Council member Kshama Sawant, who had also advocated for a $15-per-hour minimum wage, to bring the issue into the mainstream and attract support for the policy from both Seattle Mayors Michael McGinn and Murray. Both politicians sought to earn the support of Rolf and Local 775 of SEIU {{in order to bring}} their agendas to fruition. The Income Inequality Advisory Committee was scheduled to make a recommendation by April 30, 2014, allowing Murray the ability to submit a proposal to City Council by the end of July.|$|E
25|$|Once La Rue {{was engaged}} with the Grande chapelle, he made two trips to Spain. On the second trip, in 1506, he was shipwrecked in the English Channel, and spent three {{months at the}} court of Henry VII of England. After two more years in Spain, {{in the service of}} Juana of Castile – Joanna the Mad – he {{returned}} to the Netherlands in 1508, probably because Juana had been forced out of power (her husband, Philip, had died of typhus in 1506). Juana was inconsolable, unable to leave the corpse of her dead husband, and had become quite insane; why La Rue stayed as long as he did is not known, but it is not impossible that his dark, intensely expressive music {{was one of the few}} things that brought her solace. In addition, he was treated well. Juana promoted him to premier chapelain, the head of the chapel, and paid him twice what the other singers received; paying the singers was apparently the one of the only practical administrative matters she was able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>during</b> the period of her madness.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} discipline, effort and {{attention}} needed from both divers in a buddy pair, and the even greater input required in a three diver team, is unattractive to a confident diver who has other things <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>during</b> a straightforward, low risk, recreational dive, {{and the system}} is undermined when {{any one of the}} divers fails to put in the effort, putting the burden on the remaining diver who takes the responsibilities more seriously. Familiarity with the environment, and the very low incidence of life-threatening accidents is likely to lead to a confidence that {{there will not be a}} problem on any given dive, so the divers may pay less attention to good buddy practices, and this may become habitual. This may be exacerbated by the divers being strangers thrown together by chance and the whims of the divemaster, who have no real interest in each other, and whose reasons to dive may be incompatible. Pairing an explorer with a macro photographer will annoy at least one, probably both, if they comply with recommended buddy diving practices. Many nominally buddy dives effectively become solo dives soon after entering the water, with the buddies occasionally checking for the presence of each other and often being beyond direct view of each other. In spite of this, very few of these divers die as a consequence.|$|E

25|$|A retired Chicago {{police officer}} named Bill Dorsch has stated he {{has reason to}} believe {{there may be more}} victims buried within the grounds of the {{apartment}} building located at the 6100 block of West Miami Avenue in Chicago; a property which Gacy is known to have been the caretaker of for several years prior to his 1978 arrest. In 1975, Dorsch—then a Chicago police officer—observed Gacy (whom he knew on a casual basis), holding a shovel {{in the early hours of}} the morning. When confronted by Dorsch as to his actions, Gacy stated he was performing work that he was too busy <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>during</b> the day. Dorsch has also related that several other residents of West Miami Avenue have stated that, in the early- to mid-1970s, they had observed Gacy digging trenches in the grounds of the property; one of these residents has also stated that Gacy would later place plants in the elongated trenches he had dug. At the time these actions had been observed, Gacy had still been married to Carole Hoff. Following his first murder in January 1972, he is not known to have buried any murder victims beneath his own home until one month after his March, 1976 divorce. (John Butkovitch had been buried beneath his garage and the unknown victim known as Body 28 had been buried in his backyard.) Gacy's wife had informed investigators that, on several occasions in the years preceding their divorce, she had found several men's wallets and identification cards discarded about the property at 8213 Summerdale. When she had confronted Gacy about these items, he had angrily informed her the property was none of her business.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{wanted to}} have gospel music {{as part of the}} song, with {{virtually}} no instrumentation, only the sound of an organ and her singing. So she started experimenting using just her vocals, giving away to the bridge being composed. After the full song was finalized, Madonna and Leonard decided to record it alongside a choir around September 1988. Both of them met with musician Andraé Crouch and vocalist Roberto Noriega, and signed their choir to provide background vocals. Crouch scrutinized the lyrics as he wanted to [...] "find out what the intention of the song might be. We're very particular in choosing what we work with, and we liked what we heard." [...] At Jonny Yuma recording studio, he got his choir together and explained to them what they needed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>during</b> the recording session. He had listened to the demo of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] in his car, and directed the choir accordingly. The choir was recorded separately, and Leonard wanted it to be added during post-production.|$|E

Madonna {{was supposed to be the}} center of attention during the Super Bowl halftime show Sunday, but the Queen of Pop was upstaged by her collaborator M.I.A., who flipped off the camera at one point during the performance, prompting swift apologies from the NFL and NBC." [...] Madonna herself expressed her disappointment during an interview with host Ryan Seacrest on his talk show, On Air with Ryan Seacrest. She felt that it was a [...] "teenager... irrelevant thing" [...] for M.I.A. <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>during</b> the show, since it was [...] "out of place". Brian McCarthy, spokesman for the NFL said, [...] "Our system was late to obscure the inappropriate gesture and we apologize to our viewers. The NFL hired the talent and produced the halftime show. There was a failure in NBC's delay system. The obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate, very disappointing, and we apologize to our fans." [...] McCarthy also clarified that the gesture was not revealed during rehearsals, M.I.A. improvised it on stage. [...] The league later fined the rapper a total of $16.6 million as penalty, which was resolved through a confidential agreement in 2014.|$|E
500|$|The band {{contributed to}} Bosnian relief efforts to enhance {{humanitarian}} and {{public awareness of}} the issue, and Bono and Carter subsequently collaborated on the documentary Miss Sarajevo, which showcased the war-torn city during Carter's six months living there. In 1995, U2 and Eno wrote the song [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] as a response to [...] "the surreal acts of defiance that had taken place during the siege of Sarajevo". One such act was a beauty pageant organized by Bosnian women who planned to fight the war with their [...] "lipstick and heels". During the pageant, all of the participants walked onto the stage carrying a banner that said, [...] "Don't let them kill us". [...] The winner of the pageant, 17-year-old Inela Nogić, later said the pageant [...] "was a crazy thing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>during</b> a war. But we tried to live a normal life. It was some kind of a defence mechanism we all had." [...] Years later, Bono said, [...] "It was pure Dada and it deserved to be celebrated in song." [...] Of the song's meaning, he said, [...] "Everywhere people had heard their call for help—but help never came. That was the feeling. I had tried to tackle subjects like this head-on, but I'd learnt a lesson. You have to try and make the same points, in a different, less direct, more surrealist way." [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] was recorded with Luciano Pavarotti and released as the first single from U2's side-project with Eno entitled Original Soundtracks 1; the record was released under the pseudonym [...] "Passengers".|$|E
