5|$|On {{checking}} {{records of}} telephone calls {{made to the}} dealer, the police found that some had been made from a mobile phone registered in Ireland, and on further checking the records of that phone {{it appeared that the}} calls were made from locations consistent with the known whereabouts of the Ford truck. One call was to a known IRA member. <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>was</b> last used at 9:23am {{on the morning of the}} bombing, just three minutes after the bombers had parked their truck in Corporation Street. On 27 June, the phone's registered owner reported that it had been stolen 17days earlier, but the police felt they had gathered enough evidence to bring a prosecution against the six IRA men held in London.|$|E
5|$|Several {{problems}} were experienced with the iPhone 5S's hardware after its release. The most widely reported {{issue is that}} the angle reported by the phone's level sensor had drifted by several degrees, which caused the gyroscope, compass, and accelerometer to become inaccurate. Reports suggested {{that this is a}} hardware-induced problem. Some encountered other problems such as crashing with a blue screen and then restarting, the power button making a rattling noise when <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>was</b> shaken, overheating, the microphone not working, and Touch ID not working for iTunes purchases. Some of these issues have been fixed by software updates.|$|E
25|$|At 7:40p.m., {{the killer}} called the Napa County Sheriff's office {{from a pay}} {{telephone}} to report this latest crime. <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>was</b> found, still off the hook, minutes later at the Napa Car Wash on Main Street in Napa by KVON radio reporter Pat Stanley, {{only a few blocks}} from the sheriff's office, yet 27 miles from the crime scene. Detectives were able to lift a still-wet palm print from the telephone but were never able to match it to any suspect.|$|E

5000|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> has <b>been</b> {{described}} by some sources {{as being more}} “evolutionary than revolutionary” - e.g. <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>is</b> a substantial improvement over the Treo 600 and 650 models {{but it does not}} offer new capabilities that would make the Treo 700p a quantum improvement over these and other products. <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>is</b> also certainly not a perfect product, with many reviewers citing the following issues: ...|$|R

25|$|Their last album {{containing}} new material, the 1985 dance/Hi-NRG release Sex Over <b>the</b> <b>Phone,</b> <b>was</b> {{not a huge}} commercial success, but it {{fared better}} in sales and club play than Renaissance. The title track, when released as a single, was banned by the BBC because of its subject matter: credit-card phone sex. The album featured yet another new lead singer, Ray Stephens (of The Great Space Coaster fame). Py Douglas came in to sub for Stephens {{for some of the}} group's live appearances in 1985.|$|E
25|$|The new device, officially called HTC One (M8) {{or the new}} HTC One, was {{unveiled}} during a press conference on March 24, 2014, that was held simultaneously in London and New York City. <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>was</b> released {{on the same day}} shortly after the press conference, and Verizon Wireless began offering the new One at its retail outlets while a number of major carriers in Canada and the United States began offering the device for purchase online with broad retail availability in North America set for April 10.

25|$|The first {{distress}} call {{had been made}} just hours after beginning their hike: one from Kremers's iPhone at 04:39 pm and shortly after that, one from Froon's Samsung Galaxy at 04:51 pm. None of the calls had gone through {{due to a lack}} of reception in the area except for one 911 call attempt on April 3 that lasted for a little over a second before breaking up. After April 5, Froon's phone battery became exhausted after 05:00 am and was not used again. Kremers's iPhone would not make any more calls either but was intermittently turned on to search for reception. After April 6, multiple attempts of a false PIN code were entered into the iPhone; it never received the correct code again. One report showed that between the 7th and 10th of April, there were 77 emergency call attempts with the iPhone. On April 11, <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>was</b> turned on at 10:51 am, and was turned off for the last time at 11:56 am.|$|E
5000|$|Included with <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>are</b> earbuds Amazon {{claims to}} be [...] "tangle-free"; the earbud tips can be {{attached}} to each other magnetically and also have a flat cable {{in order to minimize}} tangling.

25|$|On February 9, 2016, the FBI {{announced}} that it was unable to unlock one of the mobile phones they had recovered because of the phone's advanced security features. <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>was</b> an iPhone 5C owned by the county and issued to its employee, the shooter Farook. The FBI first asked the National Security Agency to break into the phone, but the NSA was unable to do so. As a result, the FBI asked Apple Inc. to create {{a new version of the}} phone's iOS operating system that could be installed and run in the phone's random access memory to disable certain security features. Apple declined due to its policy to never undermine the security features of its products. The FBI responded by successfully applying to a United States magistrate judge, Sherri Pym, to issue a court order, mandating Apple to create and provide the requested software. The order was not a subpoena, but rather was issued under the All Writs Act of 1789.|$|E
500|$|The {{specifications}} of <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>was</b> first {{leaked out}} by an HTC insider {{towards the end}} of 2012 that had claimed the device was then called [...] "Opera UL" [...] with a 1280x720 screen, and an Adreno 305 graphics processor with the Snapdragon 1.4 GHz CPU system on chip, which was later known to match the actual specifications of the final device.|$|E

500|$|Jobs {{later said}} that Apple had begun {{developing}} the iPad before the iPhone. Jonathan Ive in 1991 had created an industrial {{design for a}} stylus-based tablet, the Macintosh Folio, as his first project for Apple; by 2004 his studio at the company was participating {{in the development of}} a large tablet prototype, which he later described as [...] "very crude, involving projectors". Ive stated that after seeking to produce the tablet first, he came to agree with Jobs that <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>was</b> more important, as the tablet's innovations would work as well in it. The iPad's internal codename was K48, which was revealed in the court case surrounding leaking of iPad information before launch.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} iPhone 4 was launched, some {{consumers}} reported that signal strength of <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>was</b> reduced when touching {{the lower left}} edge of the phone, bridging {{one of the two}} locations which separates the two antennas, resulting in dropped calls in some areas with lower signal reception.

2500|$|In 2013, the Ventura County Star commemorated the 50th {{anniversary of}} the JFK {{assassination}} with a long article about the unknown woman who had used a phone {{in the vicinity of}} Oxnard, 50 miles away from Karyn Kupcinet's home, immediately before the shooting of JFK. [...] Citing FBI documents that were declassified decades after the events of November 1963, the Ventura County Star article claims that two telephone operators with General Telephone Company who listened to the unknown woman talking for approximately 15 minutes gave the FBI a description of her voice. [...] FBI agents questioned the two operators a very short time after JFK's death. Their description did not match Kupcinet's voice in the slightest, especially regarding her age bracket.

2500|$|The letters did {{not relate}} to the {{exchange}} name. For example, the exchange prefix for Essendon was FU (which translated to 37 and later became the 37x [...] exchange used by the whole City of Essendon [...] ). Although Melbourne city numbers began with 6, it was only rarely, and probably by accident, that any other exchanges had matching letters. Numbers using the old alphanumeric scheme were written as ab.xxxx, for example FU 1234 (the actual train of digits sent to <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>was</b> [...] "371234") or MW 5550 (685550). Seven-digit numbers started appearing as early as 1960, and were all numerical from the start. There were still some six-digit numbers in Melbourne as late as 1989, but by the 1990s, they all had been converted to seven-digit numbers. Footscray used 6-digit numbers in exchange code 68 until 1987, when they were changed to 687 or 689.|$|E
2500|$|On July 2, 2014, HTC Germany {{announced}} a Dual SIM variant via a press release. <b>The</b> <b>phone</b> <b>was</b> made available in Germany, Austria and Switzerland in calendar week 28 {{of that year}} for a price of €679 (799CHF) which {{at that time was}} slightly higher than the MSRP of €649 for the single SIM version but some €100 higher than typical retail prices which had already begun to drop for the regular model. Other selected markets followed. In Germany the release was limited with only METRO-owned electronics store chains Media Markt and Saturn carrying the phone in small quantities. The only color option is [...] "Gunmetal Grey". The hardware is mostly identical to the regular model without the option to double the 16GB of on-device storage {{as is the case with}} the single SIM variant. Also, the radio supports less LTE-bands, most notably omitting band 20 which reduces LTE-usability in countries like Germany where providers prefer the 800MHz frequency outside of downtown areas. Both SIM-slots are of nano-size and the device retains the additional microSD-slot.|$|E
