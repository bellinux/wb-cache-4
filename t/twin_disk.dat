40|$|This paper {{presents}} a first thorough investigation of different laboratory tests for rail materials combined with numerical simulations and metallographic investigations. A specific methodology {{for the latter}} is given in the Appendix. Laboratory tests for new rail materials are desirable supplements to field tests {{in order to save}} time and money. Thus, less valuable products can be early withdrawn from expensive field tests. Within this work package, test conditions for laboratory tests of rail materials have been defined and compared to field conditions. Existing test equipment and evaluation methods of the WP partners have been exploited for the laboratory tests in order to find out the applicability to the pre-defined field conditions. The tests were performed at the SUROS <b>twin</b> <b>disk</b> test machine, at the VAS linear full-scale test rig and at DB full-scale roller rigs. The results were compared among other with respect to metallography and material deterioration. Subsequent numerical calculations showed that the full-scale tests more or less deviate systematically from the expected contact conditions due to bending of wheel and rail. In addition, predictions regarding RCF have been carried out and compared to test results. It is shown that <b>twin</b> <b>disk</b> tests as well as tests on a full-scale linear test rig are suitable for practical use. The tests on full-scale roller rigs failed due to the need for specific rail samples, which ultimately destroyed the fixtures during the tests.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{laboratory}} tests of rail material by railway opera-tors as well as by manufactures. The tests should represent oper-ational conditions for the rail material. They should allow withdraw-ing less valuable products from far more expensive field tests. This guideline is based on the experience from the WP 4. 3 partners with respect to laboratory tests for rail steels. As the operational demands on rail material may differ from site to site (with respect to the curvature etc.), a suitable preparation of the laboratory tests is necessary. It should start with a definition of the conditions to be tested, e. g. with a testing matrix. According to present knowledge, related tests can be done at <b>twin</b> <b>disk</b> test rigs or at specialized full-scale linear test rigs. Full-scale roller rigs are not recommended because the fixing of the samples is difficult and the preparation of the rail material requires a huge effort. After testing the wear, RCF and deformation should be evaluated in accordance with a consistent evaluation scheme. Metallographic in-vestigations could be applied especially with respect to quantifying material deterioration. The compliance with the pre-defined requirements should be moni-tored throughout the test since contact conditions may vary due to profile wear and specific test rig deviations. If such deviations occur, the test conditions should be re-evaluated through numerical simula-tions. Thus, the effect on the test results may be estimated. The results of testing on <b>twin</b> <b>disk</b> tests as well as those on a linear test rig can provide results suitable for practical use.

The mathematical models for electrical and mechanical components and wheel and rail rollers are implemented using SimPowerSystems, SimDriveline and Simulink toolboxes. The static and dynamic responses of the rollers are measured with load cells and strain gauges. The experimental data show that the creep forces saturate in the low and very low adhesion conditions at the points where the creepages are large enough to give saturation. Also the lateral position and yaw angle are sufficient to capture the key stability and guidance aspects of the vehicle system dynamics. There is a close correlation between the simulated and measured lateral creep forces so the proposed multibody model is validated. The model represents an important contribution to railway condition monitoring techniques and predictive maintenance methods because it can be easily employed in hardware-in-the-loop applications allowing accurate estimation of forces acting on the wheel-rail interface...|$|E

Similar {{to the definition}} of habitable zones around stars, debris disk structures should be identified and characterized in terms of dust temperatures rather than physical distances so that the heating power of different spectral type of stars is taken into account and common features in disks can be discussed and compared directly. Common features, such as warm (~ 150 K) dust belts near the water-ice line and cold (~ 50 K) Kuiper-belt analogs, give rise to our emerging understanding of the levels of order in debris disk structures and illuminate various processes about the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems.

For this aim and to study the damage evolution at the wheel–rail interface, some <b>twin</b> <b>disk</b> rolling contact tests were carried out on a common wheel–rail material couple under a dry rolling–sliding condition typical of normal service. The tests were stopped at progressive cycles numbers for different couples of specimens, which were then cut and observed with optical and electron microscope in order to analyse the damage evolution in the zone near to the contact interface. A wear-rolling contact fatigue competition was observed with a progressive crack tip advance following a shear band cracking mechanism and crack tail removal due to wear.

40|$|A <b>twin</b> <b>disk</b> rig {{was used}} to perform a series of {{experiments}} investigating mixed lubrication. The disks used in the experiments were manufactured from case carburising steel, were hardened and had a surface finish ground transverse to the direction of oil entrainment in order to simulate the roughness orientation typically found on involute gear teeth. Roughness profile measurements were taken in-situ between experiments which showed that the initial phase of operation for as-manufactured surfaces {{is a period of}} rapid plastic deformation, where asperity features on the surfaces accommodate to one another. It was found that this reduction in roughness improved the state of lubrication by reducing instances of contact between the surfaces. Contact was assessed by measuring the electrical contact resistance between the disks during the experiments and the level of the contact voltage between the disks was used as an indicator of the state of lubrication existing between them. It was found that variations in the dimensionless film thickness strongly influenced the level of the contact voltage. The contact voltage waveform was also found to exhibit similarity between revolutions, indicating repeated contact between groups of interacting asperities. Realigned profile traces demonstrate that prominent asperity features undergo significant plastic deformation during the running-in process. Over extended operation, it was seen that these same roughness features can be subject to a degree of fatigue at the roughness scale, which has been identified as micropitting failure in the experiments. Modifications to an existing numerical model simulating the isothermal non-Newtonian EHL point contact to enable the use of measured 3 D roughness shows that high pressures are generated in the region of interacting asperity features.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was the {{investigation}} of the use of the twin disc machine testing as an experimental method to simulate, identify and evaluate rolling contact fatigue in a short time for different combinations (ESR and standard) of cam ring steels with different case heat treatments (tempered at 180 ˚C and 240 ˚C). The ring samples were machined to achieve an elliptic contact in order to increase the contact pressure and achieve fast results. The contact pressure was calculated according to the Hertzian formula taking in account the shape parameters of the rings. The tests were performed with higher or lower amount of cycles depending on the previous results (cracks found or not) and for different contact pressures. The contact area was SEM inspected after each test. Friction and wear plots were used as fatigue criteria complementarily to the SEM analysis. The tests conditions (shape, roughness, friction coefficient) were studied and appeared to cause a scatter in the results because of their variation from one sample to another affecting the stress distribution, type of damage and the lubrication regime (film thickness). Therefore, the stress distribution was simulated under the elliptic contact surface taking in account, these parameters (shape parameters, roughness, friction coefficient). The tests showed that the <b>twin</b> <b>disk</b> testing method was useful for pitting detection in RCF under lubrication. Meanwhile, the quality of the samples was of extreme importance in order to keep constant conditions in different runs. The contact area SEM inspection after each test showed that high contact pressures induce adhesive damage in the samples that may accelerate RCF damage. The highest rolling contact fatigue limit was observed for the ESR steels. Validerat; 20110921 (anonymous...|$|E
5000|$|During this period, Tektronix {{acquired}} {{what were}} sold as the 8000 and 8002 Microprocessor Development System (MDS), the 8000 being a software development system running editors and cross-compilers with <b>twin</b> floppy <b>disk</b> storage, while the 8002 could be fitted with real-time emulators for several processors including the 8080, Z80 and 6502. These were later {{replaced by the}} 8540/8550/8560. The 8550 was a standalone development system capable of being fitted with real time emulation hardware for several different processors. The 8560 emerged just after Bell Labs were able to sell UNIX commercially, and ran a mildly modified version of UNIX V7, called TNIX, supporting 4 or 8 (depending on how many I/O processor cards were fitted) serial terminals, with a special High Speed Input/Output, based on RS-422, to connect to a remote 8540. There was a hard drive of about 34MB, later increased, and a variable amount of RAM depending on the processor card fitted, which was either a DEC LSI11-23+ or a LSI11-73, which had a wider address bus {{as well as a}} higher clock speed. The final upgraded variant was the 8562. The 8540, of which several could be connected to the 8560, contained emulation hardware similar to that available for the 8540, including RAM cards, Trigger Trace Analyser, 1 or 2 processor emulator cards, each with external probe, etc. The 8540 had no software development capability, but worked with the 8560, or other systems such as a VAX, which would provide the software development environment. It was unique in its day, in that the serial terminal could be connected to the 8540, on the bench, or to the 8560, and would pass UNIX commands automatically to the 8560, which passed emulator commands back to the 8540 for execution, completely transparently. Thus a complete compile, link, load and emulate session could be run from a UNIX shell script, a facility probably not seen on any development system since. The 8540/8550/8560 supported many 8-bit and 16-bit microprocessor types, with a change of emulator cards and probes, and installation of assembler and possibly compiler software, and did not require any particular code to be linked in to the user's code to facilitate register tracing at breakpoints, a shortcoming of the only real alternative multi-manufacturer MDS of that era, by HP. However, an impressive feature was that by including a special instruction sequence, typically a double NOP followed by a call to a specific address, the emulator would generate a [...] "Service Call" [...] to take whatever action the user required, and continue execution. This for example could allow UNIX to write variables to a log file as commanded by the running program on the emulated microprocessor.|$|R
40|$|Vega and Fomalhaut {{are similar}} in terms of mass, ages, and global debris disk properties; therefore, they are often {{referred}} to as debris <b>disk</b> <b>twins.</b> We present Spitzer 10 - 35 micrometers spectroscopic data centered at both stars and identify warm, unresolved excess emission in the close vicinity of Vega for the first time. The properties of the warm excess in Vega are further characterized with ancillary photometry in the mid-infrared and resolved images in the far-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths. The Vega warm excess shares many similar properties with the one found around Fomalhaut. The emission shortward of approximately 30 micrometers from both warm components is well described as a blackbody emission of approximately 170 K. Interestingly, two other systems, Eri and HR 8799, also show such an unresolved warm dust using the same approach. These warm components may be analogous to the solar system s zodiacal dust cloud, but of far greater mass (fractional luminosity of approximately 10 (exp- 5) to 10 (exp- 6) compared to 10 (exp- 8) to 10 (exp- 7). The dust temperature and tentative detections in the submillimeter suggest that the warm excess arises from dust associated with a planetesimal ring located near the water-frost line and presumably created by processes occurring at similar locations in other debris systems as well. We also review the properties of the 2 micrometers hot excess around Vega and Fomalhaut, showing that the dust responsible for the hot excess is not spatially associated with the dust we detected in the warm belt. We suggest it may arise from hot nano grains trapped in the magnetic field of the star. Finally, the separation between the warm and cold belt is rather large with an orbital ratio greater than or approximately 10 in all four systems. In light of the current upper limits on the masses of planetary objects and the large gap, we discuss the possible implications for their underlying planetary architecture and suggest that multiple, low-mass planets likely reside between the two belts in Vega and Fomalhaut...|$|R

Accurate prediction of this wear can improve economy, ride comfort, prevention of derailment and planning of maintenance interventions.

However, prediction of wheel and rail wear is still a great challenge for railway engineers and operators. The aim {{of this paper is to}} predict wheel wear and rail wear using an artificial neural network. Nonlinear Autoregressive models with exogenous input neural network (NARXNN) have been developed for wheel and rail wear prediction. Testing with a twin disc rig, together with measurement of wear using replica material and a profilometer have been carried out for wheel and rail wear under dry, wet and lubricated conditions and after sanding. Tests results from the <b>twin</b> <b>disk</b> rig have been used to train, validate, and test the neural network.

Accuracy of wheel and rail wear prediction using the neural network was investigated and assessed in term of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The results demonstrate that the neural network can be used efficiently to predict wheel and rail wear. The methods of collecting wear data using the replica material and the profilometer have also proved effective for wheel and rail wear measurements for training and validating the neural network.

40|$|This thesis reports {{experimental}} and theoretical analyses {{to study the}} heat generation and partition between contacting bodies under rolling/sliding elastohydrodynamic (EHL) point contact. A <b>twin</b> <b>disk</b> test rig was re-commissioned and used for the experimental work. 76 mm diameter crowned, super-finished test disks, fixed on parallel shafts, {{were used in the}} experimental EHL tests. In each disk, 6 thermocouples were installed to measure the temperature during sliding/rolling contact under EHL conditions. In addition, ceramic washers were fixed on the plane sides of each disk to minimize heat transfer over those surfaces. A Labview data acquisition system was built for acquiring data from the sensors installed on the rig. The EHL experimental results show the fast disk has significantly higher bulk temperature than the slow disk. A transient two dimensional numerical model was constructed to calculate the average circumferential temperature distribution within the disks using three thermocouples as a boundary condition. The heat partition factor, , and convection heat transfer coefficient, h, were varied systematically in the model. A linear relationship between  and hf for the fast disk and 1 - and hs for the slow disk were obtained. These two linear relations were related together by the variation of h with the rotational speed. Over the approximately steady state condition, the calculated  using this approach was in the range of 0. 65 to 0. 77 for 32 EHL tests at different loads and sliding speeds. This means that the majority of heat is conducted to the fast disk, which is compatible with the previous findings. In order to carry out transient modelling, the unloading mechanism was developed to ensure rapid disk separation. This improved the temperature trend in the cooling phase. In addition, a microswitch was used to give accurate monitoring of the disks contacting and separation. The thermocouple arrangement within the disks and their installation technique were assessed and developed. An immersion test in a hot oil bath was used to test the thermocouples dynamic response. This test was modelled, and the results showed significant lag in the measurements. It was concluded that a system identification method is required to identify the dynamic characteristics of the temperature measurement system in order to compensate for time lagging Extensive studies were carried out to determine the cause behind some of the experimental uncertainties. It was found that the most likely reason behind these uncertainties is the contact pressure variation along the disk-shaft interference fit, which would result in significant thermal conductance variation. The traction force measurement within the EHL contacts has shown broadly linear increase with increased load at constant sliding speed. This indicates a constant coefficient of friction at constant sliding speed. The results also showed that the coefficient of friction decreases as the sliding speed increases...|$|E
40|$|The {{prediction}} of wheel wear {{is a significant}} issue in railway vehicles. It is correlated with safety against derailment, economy, ride comfort, and planning of maintenance interventions, and it can result in delay, and costs {{if it is not}} predicted and controlled in an effective way. However, the {{prediction of}} wheel and rail wear is still a great challenge for railway systems. Therefore, the main aim of this thesis is to develop a method for predicting wheel wear using artificial neural networks. Initial tests were carried out using a pin-on-disc machine and this data was used to establish how wear can be measured using an Alicona profilometer. A new method has been developed for detailed wheel wear and rail wear measurements using ‘Replica’ material which was applied to the wheel and rail surfaces of the test rig to make a copy of both surfaces. The replica samples were scanned using an optical profilometer and the results were processed to establish wheel wear and rail wear. The effect of load, and yaw angle on wheel wear and rail wear were examined. The effect of dry, wet, lubricated, and sanded conditions on wheel wear and rail wear were also investigated. A Nonlinear Autoregressive model with eXogenous input neural network (NARXNN) was developed to predict the wheel and rail wear for the twin disc rig experiments. The NARXNN was used to predict wheel wear and rail wear under deferent surface conditions such as dry, wet, lubricated, and sanded conditions. The neural network model was developed to predict wheel wear in case of changing parameters such as speed and suspension parameters. VAMPIRE vehicle dynamic software was used to produce the vehicle performance data to train, validate, and test the neural network. Three types of neural network were developed to predict the wheel wear: NARXNN, backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). The wheel wear was calculated using an energy dissipation approach and contact position on straight track. The work is focused on wheel wear and the neural network prediction of rail wear was only carried out in connection with the <b>twin</b> <b>disk</b> wear tests. This thesis examines the effect of neural network parameters such as spread, goal, maximum number of neurons, and number of neurons to add between displays on wheel wear prediction. The neural network simulation results were implemented using the Matlab program. The percentage error for wheel and rail wear prediction was calculated. Also, the accuracy of wheel and rail wear prediction using the neural network was investigated and assessed in terms of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The results reveal that the neural network can be used efficiently to predict wheel and rail wear. Further work could include rail wear and prediction on a curved track...|$|E
