40|$|Background: Children consume {{foods that}} are {{colorful}} which contain food additives that stain not only the tooth structure but also the restorations. As esthetics is of prime concern for both parents and children nowadays, long-term color stability of restorative materials is of utmost importance. Aim: To evaluate the color stability of two tooth-colored restorative materials (conventional glass ionomer cement [GIC] and giomer) when immersed in various consumable drinks and food (<b>aerated</b> <b>beverage,</b> ice candy, and health drink) at different immersion periods (low, moderate, and high). Materials and Methods: A total of 100 specimens were made with each restorative material. Ten were used as a control and remaining (n = 90) as experimental. The experimental specimens were divided into three groups based on media of immersion (n = 30 each) and were further divided into three subgroups based on immersion time (n = 10 each). The color changes (ΔE values) were measured using spectrophotometer. Results: Both the tested materials showed color change; however, conventional GIC showed greater ΔE values when compared to giomer and the samples exposed <b>to</b> <b>aerated</b> <b>beverage</b> resulted in highest color change. It is also noticed that greater the exposure time, higher are the ΔE values. Conclusion: Giomer showed more resistance to color change than conventional GIC with all the tested media and immersion regimes...|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{manifold}} {{increase in}} the consumption of <b>aerated</b> <b>beverages</b> has witnessed a twin increase in tooth wear and raised demand for esthetic restorative materials. This study aimed to evaluate the surface microhardness changes of esthetic restorative materials following treatment with <b>aerated</b> <b>beverages</b> in an in-vitro situation. Material and Methods: The initial surface microhardness of the restorative materials GC Fuji II LC, GC Fuji IX, Nano Glass ionomer, Resin and Nano composite was recorded. These materials were studied under 3 groups that included those exposed to the acidic beverages daily, weekly once in a month and those that had no exposures at all. The final surface microhardness of the materials was recorded following experimentation and was subjected to statistical comparisons. Results: The restorative materials were compared for their surface microhardness changes following respective treatments using the T-test and One-way ANOVA analysis. Inter-comparisons between the groups showed statistical significance (p<. 05), when treated with both the beverages. The five restorative materials revealed surface microhardness loss; the maximum reduction noticed with the Nano glass ionomer cement tested (p<. 0005). Conclusions: The surface microhardness of restorative materials markedly reduced upon repeated exposures with acidic beverages; the product with phosphoric acid producing the maximum surface microhardness loss...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{remarkable}} {{economic growth}} in Saudi Arabia has affected the population life style negatively. The increasing problem of obesity has been reported from different regions in the kingdom. The rate of overweight and obesity reached 65. 4 % in the eastern region among females aged 18 - 74 years old. Although there is considerable amount of data on prevalence of obesity, yet, data on dietary habits and food consumption pattern are limited. Objectives: The present study is a cross- sectional descriptive study aimed at exploring the BMI distribution among university female students. Food consumption pattern and health related behaviors were also assessed. Material and Methods: 799 students participated in the study; data were collected using self administered questionnaire. Body weight and height were measured to calculate the BMI. Results: Among the study participants, overweight and obesity reached 47. 9 %. Marriage, presence of obesity among family members, frequency of drinking <b>aerated</b> <b>beverages</b> increased the risk of obesity significantly.
