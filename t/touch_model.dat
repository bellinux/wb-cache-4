50|$|The iPod Touch runs Apple's Unix-based iOS {{operating}} system (called 'iPhone OS' until 2010) and includes bundled software to browse the Internet, view maps, {{send and receive}} email, view media, and work with office documents such as presentations and spreadsheets. Users type on a virtual keyboard displayed on the screen. Apple operates an online store, allowing users to buy and directly download music, videos and third-party software. From launch, the iPod Touch was described by journalists as an 'iPhone without the phone', and each iPod <b>Touch</b> <b>model</b> to date has been introduced with the same release number of iOS as the contemporary iPhone model.|$|E
40|$|Users often {{struggle}} to enter text accurately on touchscreen keyboards. To address this, {{we present a}} flexible decoder for touchscreen text entry that combines probabilistic touch models with a language model. We investigate two different touch models. The first <b>touch</b> <b>model</b> {{is based on a}} Gaussian Process regression approach and implicitly models the inherent uncertainty of the touching process. The second <b>touch</b> <b>model</b> allows users to explicitly control the uncertainty via touch pressure. Using the first model we show that the character error rate can be reduced by up to 7 % over a baseline method, and by up to 1. 3 % over a leading commercial keyboard. Using the second model we demonstrate that providing users with control over input certainty reduces the amount of text users have to correct manually and increases the text entry rate.

40|$|Neocortex, the {{neuronal}} structure at {{the base}} of the remarkable cognitive skills of mammals, is a layered sheet of neuronal tissue composed of juxtaposed and interconnected columns. A cortical column is considered the basic module of cortical processing present in all cortical areas. It is believed to contain a characteristic microcircuit composed of a few thousand neurons. The high degree of cortical segmentation into vertical columns and horizontal layers is a boon for scientific investigation because it eases the systematic dissection and functional analysis of intrinsic as well as extrinsic connections of the column. In this review we will argue that in order to understand neocortical function one needs to combine a microscopic view, elucidating the workings of the local columnar microcircuits, with a macroscopic view, which keeps track of the linkage of distant cortical modules in different behavioral contexts. We will exemplify this strategy using the model system of vibrissal touch in mice and rats. On the macroscopic level vibrissal touch is an important sense for the subterranean rodents and has been honed by evolution to serve an array of distinct behaviors. Importantly, the vibrissae are moved actively to touch - requiring intricate sensorimotor interactions. Vibrissal touch, therefore, offers ample opportunities to relate different behavioral contexts to specific interactions of distant columns. On the microscopic level, the cortical modules in primary somatosensory cortex process touch inputs at highest magnification and discreteness - each whisker is represented by its own so-called barrel column. The cellular composition, intrinsic connectivity and functional aspects of the barrel column have been studied in great detail. Building on the versatility of genetic tools available in rodents, new, highly selective and flexible cellular and molecular tools to monitor and manipulate neuronal activity have been devised. Researchers have started to combine these with advanced and highly precise behavioral methods, on par with the precision known from monkey preparations. Therefore, the vibrissal <b>touch</b> <b>model</b> system is exquisitely positioned to combine the microscopic with the macroscopic view and promises to be instrumental in our understanding of neocortical function...|$|E

30|$|In addition, {{we found}} that after {{removing}} non-substitution errors, there were {{no statistically significant differences}} in baseline typing error rates between sitting, standing, and walking. This is in contrast to the original study which included all errors. This potentially suggests that it is non-substitution errors — hitting keys in the wrong order, typing extra characters, or missing characters altogether — which increase when moving and typing. The exact causes of these phenomona are not known but we speculate they could be in the domain of touch/motor interaction or even cognition. Thus, it may make sense to investigate whether language models should be given greater weight in the text correction process when users are walking, as the language models can correct these errors when <b>touch</b> <b>models</b> cannot.|$|R

500|$|Arshagouni, on {{the other}} hand, {{describes}} the Devotions as Donne's most mature, perhaps most complex work: a remarkable, sustained prose-poem that not only expresses conflicting and powerful internal emotions but also consciously provides its readers with a <b>touching</b> <b>model</b> of the experiences of God's elect in confronting the inexorable course of human sinfulness that characterizes life on earth. Helen Wilcox writes that [...] "the mixture of elaborate rhetoric, painstaking argument, and the frank details of his melancholic 'ridling distemper' creates a particularly powerful impact" [...] and draws particular attention to Meditation XVII, noting that despite the apparent self-interest of the Devotions, that piece highlights Donne's recognition of the ultimate interconnectedness of humanity. Meditation XVII was also the focus of Robert Jungman, who, writing in American Notes and Queries, noted it as the most forceful statement of Donne's theme in what was ultimately a [...] "powerful psychological analysis".|$|R

30|$|Our results motivate {{a number}} of {{possible}} directions for future work. Existing <b>touch</b> <b>models</b> have assumed a single usage context, or considered coarse differences between stationary and walking users but ignored finer details. Commercial models can be quite basic — for example, early versions of the Android keyboard simply moved all touches up by ten pixels. Our results motivate a more nuanced approach. Gait phase angle, or other local movement predictions could be extracted at an operating system level and used to improve the input accuracy for all touches, not just those related to typing. Based on our results, this could have a related impact on use of small form factor devices like smartwatches. In general, our analysis reinforces the need for developers to consider the behaviour of users in multiple contexts, and tune their input techniques accordingly. This also points to another potential research area: accurate detection of these usage contexts and smooth adjustment of corrective behaviour.|$|R
40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{experiments}} on Pr 2 Ir 2 O 7, we provide {{a theory of}} quantum oscillations in the Luttinger model with quadratic band <b>touching,</b> <b>modelled</b> for the spin-orbit-coupled conduction electrons in pyrochlore iridates. The magneto- and Hall resistivities are computed for electron- and hole-doped systems, and the corresponding Shubnikov de Haas (SdH) signals are investigated. The SdH signals are characterized by aperiodic behaviors that originate from the unconventional Landau level structures of the Luttinger model near the neutrality point, such as the inter-Landau level crossing, nonuniform Landau level spacings and non-parabolic dispersions along the applied magnetic-field direction. The aperiodic SdH signals observed in the paramagnetic state of Pr 2 Ir 2 O 7 are shown {{to be consistent with}} such behaviors, justifying the use of the Luttinger model and the quadratic band touching spectrum as excellent starting points for physics of pyrochlore iridates. The implications of these results are discussed in light of recent theoretical and experimental devel- opments in these systems...|$|R
