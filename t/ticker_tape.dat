5|$|A {{ceremony}} of dedication {{was held on}} the afternoon of October 28, 1886. President Grover Cleveland, the former New York governor, presided over the event. On the morning of the dedication, a parade was held in New York City; {{estimates of the number of}} people who watched it ranged from several hundred thousand to a million. President Cleveland headed the procession, then stood in the reviewing stand to see bands and marchers from across America. General Stone was the grand marshal of the parade. The route began at Madison Square, once the venue for the arm, and proceeded to the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan by way of Fifth Avenue and Broadway, with a slight detour so the parade could pass in front of the World building on Park Row. As the parade passed the New York Stock Exchange, traders threw <b>ticker</b> <b>tape</b> from the windows, beginning the New York tradition of the ticker-tape parade.|$|E

30|$|In fact, {{securities}} trading mechanisms {{have been in}} a continuous state of evolution since 1602, when the Amsterdam Stock Exchange was launched as the world’s first stock exchange (Petram 2011). In the beginning, the volume of securities traded and the number of traders involved in various marketplaces was always very small, but they grew in Amsterdam and elsewhere over time. In the 1960 s, financial information still spread rather slowly, typically through <b>ticker</b> <b>tapes,</b> and phone-based communication was expensive (Brummer 2008). Trading was almost always a manual process.|$|R
25|$|<b>Ticker</b> <b>tape</b> is a {{means of}} {{transmitting}} stock price information over telegraph lines. It consists of a paper strip which ran through a machine called a stock ticker, which printed abbreviated company symbols followed by price and volume information. <b>Ticker</b> <b>tape</b> was invented in 1867 by Edward A. Calahan, an employee of the American Telegraph Company.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ticker</b> <b>tapes</b> {{then and}} now contain {{generally}} the same information. The ticker symbol is {{a unique set of}} characters used to identify the company. The shares traded is the volume for the trade being quoted. Price traded refers to the price per share of a particular trade. Change direction is a visual cue showing whether the stock is trading higher or lower than the previous trade, hence the terms downtick and uptick. Change amount refers to the difference in price from the previous day’s closing. These are reflected in the modern style tickers that we see today. Many today include color to indicate whether a stock is trading higher than the previous day’s (green), lower than previous (red), or has remained unchanged (blue or white).|$|R
5000|$|In 1978, KWHY-TV {{received}} the first subscription television license in the United States from the Federal Communications Commission and soon thereafter replaced {{much of the}} ethnic programming with the pay-TV service SelecTV. In 1982, Coast Television Corporation sold the station to Harriscope of Los Angeles, Inc. KWHY-TV took the business news programming {{through a number of}} facelifts and distribution expansions. In the 1980s as cable television's reach expanded beyond Los Angeles and Quotron's technology became obsolete, the business news format was reinvented. A complete graphical overhaul was made, creating the first multi-element screen. This showed all of the stock and commodity indexes, two rows of stock <b>ticker</b> <b>tapes</b> and over-the-shoulder real-time pricing information. Meanwhile, an anchor read the news live. The service was renamed [...] "The Business Channel". At the same time, KWHY faced competition from KSCI (channel 18), an affiliate of the Financial News Network. During this time, KWHY became the first station in the county with an automated commercial playback machine, and the first to utilize computer animation from an optical disc player.|$|R
40|$|A {{molecular}} {{device that}} records time-varying signals would enable new approaches in neuroscience. We have recently proposed such a device, termed a "molecular ticker tape", {{in which an}} engineered DNA polymerase (DNAP) writes time-varying signals into DNA {{in the form of}} nucleotide misincorporation patterns. Here, we define a theoretical framework quantifying the expected capabilities of molecular <b>ticker</b> <b>tapes</b> as a function of experimental parameters. We present a decoding algorithm for estimating time-dependent input signals, and DNAP kinetic parameters, directly from misincorporation rates as determined by sequencing. We explore the requirements for accurate signal decoding, particularly the constraints on (1) the polymerase biochemical parameters, and (2) the amplitude, temporal resolution, and duration of the time-varying input signals. Our results suggest that molecular recording devices with kinetic properties similar to natural polymerases could be used to perform experiments in which neural activity is compared across several experimental conditions, and that devices engineered by combining favorable biochemical properties from multiple known polymerases could potentially measure faster phenomena such as slow synchronization of neuronal oscillations. Sophisticated engineering of DNAPs is likely required to achieve molecular recording of neuronal activity with single-spike temporal resolution over experimentally relevant timescales...|$|R

25|$|As {{early as}} the 1870s, teleprinter-like devices were used to {{simultaneously}} type and transmit stock market text data from the keyboard across telegraph lines to stock ticker machines to be immediately copied and displayed onto <b>ticker</b> <b>tape.</b> The teleprinter, in its more contemporary form, was developed from 1907 to 1910 by American mechanical engineer Charles Krum and his son Howard, with early contributions by electrical engineer Frank Pearne.
