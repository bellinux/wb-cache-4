5|$|After her coronation, Anne {{settled into}} a quiet routine at the King's {{favourite}} residence, Greenwich Palace, to prepare for <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> her baby. The child was born slightly prematurely on 7 September 1533. Between three and four in the afternoon, Anne {{gave birth to a}} girl, who was christened Elizabeth, probably in honour of either or both Anne's mother Elizabeth Howard and Henry's mother, Elizabeth of York. But <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> a girl was a heavy blow to her parents, since they had confidently expected a boy. All but one of the royal physicians and astrologers had predicted a son for them and the French king had already been asked to stand as his godfather. Now the prepared letters announcing <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> a prince had an s hastily added to them to read princes and the traditional jousting tournament for <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> an heir was cancelled.|$|E
