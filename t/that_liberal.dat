5|$|Once more {{in nearly}} a two to one margin, the gay rights {{ordinance}} was defeated in Eugene. A poll taken after the vote showed <b>that</b> <b>liberal</b> voters who were not gay simply declined {{to show up and}} vote, and those who opposed the ordinance were much more motivated.|$|E
5|$|Some {{branches}} of feminism closely track the political leanings {{of the larger}} society, such as liberalism and conservatism, or focus on the environment. Liberal feminism seeks individualistic equality {{of men and women}} through political and legal reform without altering the structure of society. Catherine Rottenberg has argued that the neoliberal shirt in Liberal feminism has led to that form of feminism being individualized rather than collectivized and becoming detached from social inequality. Due to this she argues <b>that</b> <b>Liberal</b> Feminism cannot offer any sustained analysis of the structures of male dominance, power, or privilege.|$|E

25|$|The {{controversial}} democratic peace theory holds <b>that</b> <b>liberal</b> democracies {{have never}} (or rarely) made war {{on one another}} and that lesser conflicts and internal violence are rare between and within democracies. It also argues that {{the growth in the}} number of democratic states will, in the not so distant future, end warfare.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations International Bioethics Committee wrote <b>that</b> <b>liberal</b> {{eugenics}} {{should not}} be confused with the ethical problems of the 20th century eugenics movements. However that it is still problematic because it challenges the idea of human equality and opens up new ways of discrimination and stigmatization against those who do not want or cannot afford the enhancements.|$|E
25|$|Clark H. Pinnock, {{who later}} became an {{advocate}} of open theism, taught at the New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

He did not embrace more liberal views until later. Ironically, he was a great influence on future conservative leaders, including Paige Patterson.|$|E

25|$|The Globe {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of being a progressive institution, and especially on social issues. We are pro-choice; we're against the death penalty; we're for gay rights. But if people read us carefully, they will find that on a whole series of other issues, we are not knee-jerk. We're for charter schools; we're for any number of business-backed tax breaks. We are a lot more nuanced and subtle than <b>that</b> <b>liberal</b> stereotype does justice to.|$|E
25|$|Regarding {{the debate}} {{about the role of the}} liberal {{democratic}} model in peacebuilding, one side contends <b>that</b> <b>liberal</b> democracy is a viable end goal for peacebuilding activities in itself but that the activities implemented to achieve it need to be revised; a rushed transition to democratic elections and market economy can undermine stability and elections held or economic legislation enacted are an inappropriate yardstick for success. Institutional change is necessary and transitions need to be incremental.|$|E
25|$|At its 2007 convention, the PPD {{approved}} a new philosophy and set of ideals for the party. The new philosophy commits {{the party to}} defending a political status for the island that is based in the irrevocable {{right of the people}} of Puerto Rico to form a sovereign country. This shift in philosophy caused a stir among party detractors, since the PPD was not known for being <b>that</b> <b>liberal</b> before. Its conservative stance had been represented by its unshakable defense of the commonwealth status quo.|$|E

5000|$|Finkelstein {{is known}} for his hard-edged {{political}} campaigns, which often focus on a single message with great repetition. He is credited with helping to make [...] "liberal" [...] a dirty word in the United States during the late 1980s and 1990s through the use of commercial messages such as this, intended to damage the image of Jack Reed: <b>That's</b> <b>liberal.</b> <b>That's</b> Jack Reed. <b>That's</b> wrong. Call <b>liberal</b> Jack Reed and tell him his record on welfare is just too liberal for you.|$|R
25|$|During the 2004 Canadian federal election, {{controversy}} erupted over Layton's accusation <b>that</b> <b>Liberal</b> Prime Minister Paul Martin {{was responsible}} for the deaths of homeless people because he failed to provide funding for affordable housing. While rates of homelessness and homeless deaths increased during the eleven years of Liberal government, the link to Martin's decisions was indirect as affordable housing is a mainly provincial jurisdiction. Layton's charge was defended by some, including the Ottawa Citizen, but most attacked it as inaccurate and negative campaigning. Moreover, the controversy consumed the campaign, overshadowing policy announcements over the next week.|$|E
25|$|In May 2011, Nick Clegg {{revealed}} {{plans to}} make the House of Lords a mainly elected chamber, {{limiting the number of}} peers to 300, 80% of whom would be elected with a third of that 80% being elected every 5 years by single transferable vote. In August 2012, Clegg announced that attempts to reform the House of Lords would be abandoned due to opposition for the proposals by backbench Conservative MPs. Claiming the coalition agreement had been broken, Clegg stated <b>that</b> <b>Liberal</b> Democrat MPs would no longer support changes to the House of Commons boundaries for the 2015 general election.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the revolt}} was a proscribed topic during Nicholasâ€™ reign, Alexander Herzen placed the {{profiles}} of executed Decembrists {{on the cover}} of his radical periodical Polar Star. Alexander Pushkin addressed poems to his Decembrist friends, Nikolai Nekrasov wrote a long poem about the Decembrist wives, and Leo Tolstoy started writing a novel on <b>that</b> <b>liberal</b> movement, which would later evolve into War and Peace. In the Soviet era Yuri Shaporin produced an opera entitled Dekabristi (The Decembrists), about the revolt, with the libretto written by Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy. It premiered at the Bolshoi Theatre on 23 June 1953.|$|E

50|$|The {{birth of}} a {{distinctly}} Salvadoran literature must be placed in historical context. It was {{with the rise of}} Rafael ZaldÃ­var in 1876 <b>that</b> <b>liberals</b> defeated their conservative rivals. As they founded a national state from the ground up, literature became increasingly relevant.|$|R
25|$|One other effect <b>that</b> <b>Liberal</b> land reforms had was {{the start}} of coffee plantations, {{especially}} in the Soconusco region. One reason for this push in this area was that Mexico was still working to strengthen its claim on the area against Guatemalaâ€™s claims on the region. The land reforms brought colonists from other areas of the country as well as foreigners from England, the United States and France. These foreign immigrants would introduce coffee production to the areas, as well as modern machineray and professional administration of coffee plantations. Eventually, this production of coffee would become the state's most important crop.|$|E
25|$|Fascists believe <b>that</b> <b>liberal</b> {{democracy}} is obsolete and they regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state {{as necessary to}} prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties. Such a state is led by a strong leaderâ€”such as a dictator and a martial government composed {{of the members of}} the governing fascist partyâ€”to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society. Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature and views political violence, war and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation. Fascists advocate a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarky through protectionist and interventionist economic policies.|$|E
25|$|During the 1920s Henderson-Stewart {{worked at}} the British Overseas Bank in London. His {{political}} activity occurred through the Land and Nation League, a Liberal body which {{had been set up}} to promote the land policy which was being promoted by David Lloyd George. By 1929 he was Secretary of the League, and he was selected as the Liberal candidate for Dundee. Like Derby this was a two-member constituency but unlike Derby the Conservatives nominated only one candidate, and it was recognised <b>that</b> <b>Liberal</b> and Conservative voters (each of whom had two votes) would use their second vote for the other party's candidate. Henderson-Stewart finished as runner-up, some 13,712 votes from winning a seat but having put in a creditable performance.|$|E

25|$|Epstein (1972) argues <b>that</b> <b>liberals</b> were {{especially}} fascinated by Buckley, and often wanted to debate him, {{in part because}} his ideas resembled their own, for Buckley typically formulated his arguments in reaction to left-liberal opinion, rather than being founded on conservative principles that were alien to the liberals.|$|R
5000|$|Forza Italia thus {{presented}} {{itself as a}} bridge between Catholics and non-Catholics, who have been previously divided {{in the political system}} of the First Republic, and [...] "the union of three political-cultural areas: <b>that</b> of <b>liberal</b> and popular Catholicism, <b>that</b> of secular, <b>liberal</b> and republican humanism and <b>that</b> of <b>liberal</b> socialism". In a speech during a party congress in 1998, Berlusconi himself proclaimed: [...] "our liberal vision of the State is perfectly in agreement with the Catholic social teaching".|$|R
