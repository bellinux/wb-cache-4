50|$|<b>The</b> Christological <b>argument</b> for <b>the</b> {{existence}} of God {{is based on}} certain claims about Jesus. <b>The</b> <b>argument,</b> which exists in several forms, holds that if these claims are valid, one should accept God exists.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>argument</b> from {{desire is}} an <b>argument</b> for <b>the</b> {{existence}} of God and/or a heavenly afterlife. The best-known defender of <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> is <b>the</b> Christian writer C. S. Lewis. Briefly and roughly, <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> states that humans’ natural desire for eternal happiness must {{be capable of}} satisfaction, because all natural desires are capable of satisfaction. Versions of <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> have been offered since the Middle Ages, and <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> continues to have defenders today.|$|R
40|$|This article assesses <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> by Alan Gewirth, {{which is}} {{foundational}} for the Sheffield School of legal idealism, that every agent is rationally committed to asserting that {{it and all}} other agents have rights to freedom and well-being. It is shown that the most salient objection to <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> misunderstands its nature. However the initial part of <b>the</b> <b>argument,</b> because of its prudential character, is valid only in virtue {{of the fact that}} its 'protagonist', the individual for whom <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> is supposed to be rationally compelling, is identical to its 'subject', the individual about whom <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> makes its successive statements. This fact prevents <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> from establishing its central claim, as that claim must be interpreted to ground the rest of <b>the</b> <b>argument.</b> Therefore <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> as a whole fails. Some implications of this finding for the Sheffield School approach are suggested...|$|R

5|$|Other {{psychologists have}} {{questioned}} the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning. Social intuitionists such as Jonathan Haidt, for example, argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness, law, human rights, or abstract ethical values. Thus <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of intuitive decisions; moral reasoning may be less relevant to moral action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>arguments</b> for {{evolution}} being {{a religion}} generally amount to arguments by analogy: {{it is argued}} that evolution and religion have one or more things in common, and that therefore evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such arguments are statements that evolution is based on faith, and that supporters of evolution dogmatically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand. These claims have become more popular in recent years as the neo-creationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.|$|E

Whether Madison's theory of Republicanism really supported the nullification movement, and more broadly whether the ideas he expressed between 1798 and 1800 are consistent with his work before and after this period, are the main questions surrounding the Report in the modern literature.|$|E
