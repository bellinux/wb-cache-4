5|$|In 1989, annual <b>timber</b> <b>harvest</b> revenue {{on federal}} forest land {{nationwide}} peaked at $1.5 billion. Following that year, {{the impact of}} overharvesting and increased environmental concerns began to negatively impact timber sales on the O lands. In 1994, the federal Northwest Forest Plan was implemented. Designed to guide forest management of federal lands while protecting old-growth forest habitat for endangered species such as the Northern spotted owl, the plan restricted the land available for <b>timber</b> <b>harvest.</b> By 1998, revenue on federal forest lands fell {{to a third of}} the peak 1989 revenue, with areas in the Northwest particularly hard-hit.|$|E

25|$|Like many forested {{regions of}} the western United States and Canada, many large species of animal {{can be found in}} the woods of the region. Most common are the Roosevelt elk and black-tailed deer, as well as bobcats and North American cougar.

40|$|<b>Timber</b> <b>harvesting</b> and {{transport}} are crucial {{components of the}} cost of delivered wood to forest products processing facilities. In fact, harvesting and delivering wood often costs more than the entire costs of growing wood until <b>harvest.</b> As such, <b>timber</b> <b>harvesting</b> research and development are important. Additionally, research in this area is worthwhile because efficiency gains, cost improvements, and environmental benefits due to <b>timber</b> <b>harvesting</b> research can be realized {{in a very short time}} period, rather than the decades-long wait required for research investments in timber growing. This paper provides an overview of the means of measuring the impact of new technology on <b>timber</b> <b>harvesting</b> costs. In recent years, there have been many efforts to increase research for developing better harvesting equipment and methods. In conjunction with these efforts, greater demands have been made for research efficiency and accountability (Silversides et al. 1988); several studies have therefore been completed to measure the impacts of <b>timber</b> <b>harvesting</b> research and development. These studies, other means of evaluating <b>timber</b> <b>harvesting</b> research, and suggestions for future evaluations are discussed...|$|R

2500|$|Deforestation {{is also a}} large {{conservation}} {{concern because}} Igapó forests are characterized by slow tree growth due to low soil nutrient content and high soil acidity. Despite low nutrient availability, Igapó and other floodplain forests can be biodiverse with some partially endemic species. Due to soil chemistry and seasonal inundation, trees and other resources tend to grow back more slowly after harvest by humans than in other types of Amazonian forests, [...] Accordingly, igapó forests cannot sustain <b>timber</b> <b>harvest.</b> For the future, igapó forests should be fully protected from logging and deforestation because of the low productivity found in them.|$|E
