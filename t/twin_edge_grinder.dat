For this experiment, we used factorial designs and the result showed that the factors effected of surface roughness was the feed rate and the speed while the depth of cut did not effect with the surface roughness. Furthermore, the surface roughness was likely to reduce when the speed was 3, 600 rpm and the feed rates was 1, 000 mm/min.

40|$|Modification of the {{eutectic}} silicon in hypoeutectic Al–Si alloys {{causes a}} structural {{transformation of the}} silicon phase from a needle-like to a fine fibrous morphology and is carried out extensively in industry to improve mechanical properties. It has been documented that the fibrous silicon phase in chemically modified alloys is heavily twinned. It has been proposed that this increased density of twinning results from the adsorption of impurity-elements at the solid–liquid interface perpetuating further growth according to a <b>twin</b> plane re-entrant <b>edge</b> (TPRE) model. In this paper, we discuss this mechanism of eutectic modification in light of experimental data obtained by synchrotron radiation and predictions based on theoretical calculations. This research utilizes a μ-XRF (X-ray fluorescence) technique at the SPring- 8 synchrotron radiation facility X-ray source and reveals that different elements which theoretically satisfy the geometric requirements of the impurity-induced TPRE model {{do not have the}} same effect on the growth of silicon during solidification.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between the morphologies and growth mechanisms of primary silicon crystals were studied using a hot etching technique to observe growth steps across polished cross-sections. The most frequent morphologies of primary silicon observed were octahedral and starlike. Octahedral crystals are most often bifurcated across a central twin plane to form spinel twins. Their faceted growth isfacilitated by dislocations emerging from the faceted surfaces which nucleate successive atomic planes that spread across the facet surface. Alternatively, accelerated corner growth (skeletal growth) can also nucleate the atomic planes. Starlike crystals usually exhibit five branches in a twin relationship, radiating from a centre. Evidence is presented that each branch can grow as afaceted octahedron, although initial growth may occur by the <b>twin</b> plane re-entrant <b>edge</b> (TPRE) mechanism. This mechanism is the accepted growth mode of a third morphology, plate like growth, which has been described previously. There is {{a great variety of}} other morphologies, mostly irregular, described in the literature.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that growth of eutectic silicon in aluminium-silicon alloys occurs by a <b>twin</b> plane re-entrant <b>edge</b> (TPRE) mechanism. It {{has been proposed}} that modification of eutectic silicon by trace additions occurs due to a massive increase in the twin density caused by atomic effects at the growth interface. In this study, eutectic microstructures and silicon twin densities in samples modified by elemental additions of barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), yttrium (Y) and ytterbium (Yb) (elements chosen due to a near-ideal atomic radii for twinning) in an A 356. 0 alloy have been determined by optical microscopy, thermal analysis, X-ray diffractometry (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Addition of barium or calcium caused the silicon structure to transform to a fine fibrous morphology, while the addition of yttrium or ytterbium resulted in a refined plate-like eutectic structure. Twin densities in all modified samples are higher than in unmodified alloys, {{and there are no}} significant differences between fine fibrous modification (by Ba and Ca) and refined plate-like modification (by Y and Yb).

40|$|International audienceThe growth {{characteristics}} of eutectic Si in unmodified and Sr-modified Al- 12. 7 %Si alloys were investigated by microstructure-correlated crystallographic analyses. For the unmodified alloys, {{the formation of}} repeated single-orientation twin variants enables rapid growth of eutectic Si according to the <b>twin</b> plane re-entrant <b>edge</b> (TPRE) mechanism. Microscopically, Si crystals are plate-like elongated in one direction {{that is not in}} accordance with the growth assumed by the TPRE model. The growth direction is realized by paired zigzag growth on parallel twinning planes, leading to alternate disappearance and creation of 141 re-entrants. As each twinning plane is associated with three re-entrants, Si crystals may extend in three co-planar directions and cause the formation of equilateral plates. With the formation of cc-Al around eutectic Si, the number of re-entrants is reduced. The planar isotropic growth of eutectic Si becomes anisotropic, leading to the formation of long plates. The reduction of the number of re-entrants also accounts for the width and thickness changes over the length of Si plates. This complex growth mode results in Si crystals exposing only their low-energy planes to the melt. For the Sr-modified alloys, substantial changes appear in the eutectic Si morphology, attributable to the restricted TPRE growth and the impurity induced twinning (IIT) growth. The former enhances lateral growth by forming new twins with parallel twinning planes, while the latter leads to isotropic growth by forming differently oriented twins...|$|R
40|$|Many five-fold {{branched}} Si particles (Sip) {{were observed}} in Al– 40 wt% Si functionally graded materials produced by a single-step laser cladding process on cast Al-alloy substrate. In this paper the five-fold twinning and growth features of Sip are scrutinized with orientation imaging microscopy and electron microscopic examination. It is a more in depth study of formation of the Si particles in functionally graded materials as published earlier. These Si particles have grown from twinned decahedron nuclei consisting of five tetrahedrons that share a common 110 axis. The <b>twin</b> plane re-entrant <b>edge</b> (TPRE) mechanism explains both the branch growth in the radial direction and the elongation of Sip along their common 110 axis. Subsequent twinning within the twinned tetrahedrons provides additional re-entrant grooves on their top faces, which are important for the rapid elongation and consequently for the continuous growth of the branched particle. The 7. 5 ° mismatch that arises by putting together five tetrahedrons around a common 110 axis is accommodated by small-angle grain boundaries (SAGBs). The SAGBs may disturb the progress of growth steps, which causes the particles to branch. The most remarkable facts of the study are that the five-fold branched silicon particles are much bigger (25 ~ 40 µm) than the nanometer sizes previously {{reported in the literature}} and the 7. 5 ° mismatch is accommodated mainly by multiple SAGBs. The examples of a single SAGB reported before are just a special case of the SAGB mechanism. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} the current {{literature}} on binary eutectic systems shows that, although the simpler eutectic morphologies produced between phases of low entropy of fusion are now fairly well documented and understood, the same is not true {{when one of the}} phases has a high entropy of fusion. This thesis is an attempt to partially rectify this dearth of fundamental information on metal/non-metal eutectic systems. The system aluminium / silicon was chosen as being one typical of this class of eutectic alloys, High purity specimens were undirectionally solidified under carefully controlled and treasured growth conditions. The resultant microstructures were then classified in terms of the growth variables of R - the growth rate G - the temperature gradient in the liquid ahead of the growing interface C - the alloy composition The growth variables were found to greatly affect the mode of the eutectic reaction and to cause not only changes in the scale of the eutectic microstructure but to alter the form of the microstructure as well. The undirectionally grown specimens were subjected to detailed morphological and crystallographic analyses and in this way information was obtained about the possible growth mechanisms of these various forms of the eutectic microstructure. The various eutectic forms were as follows: a) Long range Diffusion When the Al/Si specimens were undirectionally solidified above a certain critical G/R value (G/R = 10 7 sec. °C. cm - 2), the two eutectic phases grew by means of a relatively long range diffusion process. The aluminium phase grew with an isothermal interface and the silicon grew with a non-isothermal interface, to produce a massive form of the eutectic. The interconnected silicon phase grew by a <b>twin</b> plane reentrant <b>edge</b> growth mechanism. b) Short range Diffusion Below this critical G/R value, the two eutectic phases grew by a short range diffusion process, which could be either steady or non-steady state depending on the growth conditions. The form of these short range diffusion types depended upon the growth kinetics of the silicon phase and the ease of aluminium overgrowth. i) Si growth textured form At low growth rates (R ~ 10 - 5 cm/sec.) the silicon phase grew by means of a screw dislocation kinetic mechanism and this produced interconnected silicon crystals elongated in the growth direction which had a Si growth texture; the width of these particles being affected by both growth rate and temperature gradient. This form of the eutectic silicon normally grew by a steady state and short range diffusion process. Corrugated silicon particles were observed, however, indicating that a non-steady state growth mechanism could also operate. ii) { 111 } Spinel twin related form When the pure eutectic alloy was unidirectionally grown at higher growth rates (R > 3 x 10 - 4 cm/sec.) the eutectic silicon phase grew by a different kinetic mechanism which involved the use of { 111 } spinel twins. Growth was normally by a non-steady state process and this produced an irregular microstructure. The eutectic silicon in this form of the alloy was always found to be interconnected, even at the highest attainable growth rates, (i. e. rapid quenches) and it was shown that isany of the irregular silicon particles grew by means of a <b>twin</b> plane reentrant <b>edge</b> mechanism and that the various particles were related to each other via multiple { 111 }; spinel twins. In hypereutectic alloys this same T. P. R. E. growth mechanism for the silicon phase produced a steady state complex regular structure with a Si growth texture in addition to the irregular form already mentioned above. c) Repeated Nucleantion and Growth No experimental evidence was obtained to show that Al/Si eutectic alloys ever grew by a process of repeated nucleation and growth. The eutectic silicon phase was always found to be interconnected. [...] Unidirectional solidification experiments with the other F. C. C. metal/silicon eutectic systems (Ag/Si and Au/Si) produced microstructures which showed the same silicon morphology and crystallography as the Al/Si system. Finally, {{in the light of the}} work on the pure Al/Si eutectic system, a series of controlled experiments were carried out on the modification of the alloy by metallic sodium. Results showed that the modified eutectic silicon was fibrous and interconnected and very similar to the rapidly quenched pure eutectic. It was concluded that the addition of sodium to Al/Si alloy must produce the change in microstructure by affecting the growth and not the nucleation of the eutectic silicon. From the experimental results it appeared that the sodium was affecting the growth of the eutectic silicon by preferential poisoning of twin plane reentrant growth sites. </p...|$|R
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made in this thesis to {{elucidate}} the effects of growth velocity, temperature gradient and impurity additions on the structure of the aluminium-silicon eutectic, and in particular on the transition from an (unmodified) flaky to a (modified) fibrous morphology. Samples of pure eutectic alloy have been unidirectionally solidified over a range of growth rates and at two temperature gradients, and specimens examined by optical, transmission electron and scanning electron microscopy in order to characterise the flake to fibre transition. It has been found that the transition occurs over a range of growth rates, with, increasing temperature gradient favouring the fibrous morphology. Transmission electron microscopy has confirmed the presence of twins in the flake silicon, but twins have not been observed in the fibrous silicon, although this is not considered to be conclusive evidence that twins were not present. Measurements have been made of the growth undercooling as a function of velocity for the flaky silicon, and it has been found that the flake silicon eutectic can be grown at undercoolings of 15 Â°C and over. In order to compare the effects of different modifying elements, ingots of pure alloy have been doped with various impurity elements and thermally analysed, after which the microstruetures have been examined using optical and scanning electron microscopy. It has been found that sodium, potassium and strontium modify the eutectic while other group II and the group V elements are ineffective. Comparison of growth undercoolings has showed that the modified eutectic grows at undercoolings of 3 Â°C and over, the undercooling under given conditions increasing in the order strontium, potassium, sodium. Lithium has been found to produce an anomalous microstructure. Phosphorous has been found to refine the primary silicon, and crystallographic particles inside the primary crystals have been shown by microprobe analysis to contain phosphorous and aluminium. A hot stage has been designed and constructed in which experiments using eutectic droplets melted onto silicon single crystal substrates have been carried out, Measurements have been made of undercoolings for nucleation of eutectic on silicon showing that silicon does not nucleate the eutectic. The droplets have been found by X-ray analysis to be polycrystalline, so no epitaxial relationship has been found for eutectic aluminium and primary silicon. Growth layers formed by cooling modified and unmodified droplets from above the eutectic temperature have been compared, and it has been concluded that these layers had been formed by layer growth of the { 111 } silicon substrate. Twinned primary silicon crystals have been observed projecting upwards from the growth layer and it has been concluded that growth using <b>twin</b> plane re-entrant <b>edges</b> is more kinetically favourable than { 111 } layer growth. The principle of temperature gradient zone melting has been used to compare the migration rates of modified and unmodified droplets across a silicon single crystal substrate in an applied temperature gradient. It has been found that modification by strontium reduces the migration rate. Finally, it has been proposed that morphological transitions in this system depend on the difference between the kinetic undercoolings of the aluminium and silicon phases, and that they do not occur at fixed total undercoolings. </p...|$|R
