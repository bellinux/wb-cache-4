5|$|The current 63rd Street Line was {{the final}} version of {{proposals}} for a northern midtown tunnel from the IND Queens Boulevard Line to the Second and Sixth Avenue lines, which date back to the IND Second System of the 1920s and 1930s. The current plans were drawn up in the 1960s under the MTA's Program For Action. In the original 1960s plans, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> station (in addition to or as an alternative to 21st Street–Queensbridge) located farther east at Northern Boulevard, one block north of the Queens Plaza station of the Queens Boulevard line. <b>There</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> pedestrian transfer passageway between the two stations.|$|E
5|$|The plans {{called for}} a two-track station which would be {{connected}} to the surface via elevators. At ground level, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> vestibule with traveller facilities and ticket sales. The main entrance was to be from Balchensgate, with a secondary entrance from the street junction Elisenbergveien–Frognerveien.|$|E

5|$|The Scott Wilson Report did not {{consider}} extending the line beyond Tweedbank due to the increased capital and operating costs of continuing further without a corresponding increase in passenger demand. The Campaign for Borders Rail consider nevertheless that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> strong case for reaching Melrose {{on the basis of}} the town's role in Borders tourism.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} is that megalodon bore a similarity to the whale shark (Rhincodon typus) or the basking shark (Cetorhinus maximus). The tail fin {{would have been}} crescent-shaped, the anal fin and second dorsal fin would have been small, and <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> caudal keel present {{on either side of}} the tail fin (on the caudal peduncle). This build is common in other large aquatic animals, such as whales, tuna, and other sharks, in order to reduce drag while swimming. The head shape, however, can vary between species as most of the drag-reducing adaptations are toward the tail-end of the animal.|$|E
5|$|Greenway {{suggested}} {{that both the}} French settlers and their slaves ate the Guadeloupe amazon, as well as destroying its habitat. The supposedly related imperial amazon survives in the steep mountain forests of Dominica, whereas Guadeloupe is less mountainous and more suitable for farming, and has a larger population of humans. Because of this, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> greater pressure on the Guadeloupe amazon, and {{it appears to have}} become extinct {{by the end of the}} 18th century. The amazons still surviving on the West Indian islands are all endangered since they are trapped for the pet-trade, overhunted for food, and because of destruction of their habitat.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{for a new}} {{building}} on the site have gone through several generations. The first design consisted of a six-storey building (including basement), which had a large shop on the ground floor, {{as well as an}} underground car park and four floors of residential apartments, with a top level to hold the building's mechanics. Each floor would have 4,000 square feet (372 m2), and <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> leaning tower {{to the side of the}} building. The design was given planning permission in 2005.|$|E
5|$|This {{season ends}} on a cliffhanger {{due to the}} Writers' Strike. The show's head writer and {{executive}} producer, Jason Katims, stated that this last episode was “not in any way viewed as the season finale... If we were leading {{to the end of}} the season , we would have most likely brought the story around to the coach and his family again,” and <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> strong football element as well, Katims said.

5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. <b>There</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E

5|$|Three {{construction}} {{options were}} evaluated during the project's Environmental Impact Study for {{the portion of}} the line between 11th Street and Hanover Square. One option known as the Shallow Chrystie Option would mainly use cut and cover, while the Deep Chrystie Street and Forsyth Options would use a combination of tunneling by Earth Pressure Balance Machines (EPBMs) and cut and cover. The Shallow Chrystie Option would have used the existing Confucius Plaza tunnel section between Canal and Division Streets, and like the plan from the 1970s, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> cross-platform transfer to the existing Grand Street station, with the transfer expected to be heavily used. However, this option would require digging up Sara Delano Roosevelt Park to the east as Chrystie Street is not wide enough to fit four tracks. Under this option, a track connection would be built to allow trains from Second Avenue to run via the Manhattan Bridge north tracks to allow service to Brooklyn. The Forsyth Option would curve below the park to Forsyth Street and the station would be built under Forsyth Street, requiring a 200-foot transfer passageway that would be less convenient than the other options. The Deep Chrystie Option would have the Second Avenue Subway run deeper underground, running underneath the existing Grand Street station, with a mezzanine in between the two stations. In order to allow for sufficient room for stairways to transfer to the Second Avenue Line, the Grand Street station would be widened to have twenty foot wide platforms. No track connection would be built under this option, and the Confucius Plaza tunnel section would not be used for subway service, but it instead might be used for ancillary subway facilities. Currently, this is the preferred option.|$|E

The fact that the Ashes must be fought for is a further damper. I believe that if a series is drawn, then the Ashes should at least go into pawn so that no one holds them.|$|E
25|$|Another study, also {{focused on}} the mtDNA (that which is {{inherited}} through only the maternal line), revealed that the indigenous people of the Americas have their maternal ancestry traced back to a few founding lineages from East Asia, which would have arrived via the Bering strait. According to this study, {{it is probable that}} the ancestors of the Native Americans would have remained for a time in the region of the Bering Strait, after which <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> rapid movement of settling of the Americas, taking the founding lineages to South America.|$|E
25|$|The {{name of the}} Globe {{supposedly}} {{alludes to}} the Latin tag totus mundus agit histrionem, in turn derived from quod fere totus mundus exerceat histrionem—"because all {{the world is a}} playground"—from Petronius, which had wide circulation in England in the Burbages' time. Totus mundus agit histrionem was, according to this explanation, therefore adopted as the theatre's motto. Another allusion, familiar to the contemporary theatre-goer, would have been to Teatrum Mundi, a meditation by the twelfth-century classicist and philosopher John of Salisbury, in his Policraticus, book three. In either case, <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> familiar understanding of the classical derivation without the adoption of a formal motto.|$|E

25|$|In turn, the {{thinking}} in Nordic Classicism {{became one of}} the basis for the development of Modernism in the Nordic Countries. The idea that <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> continuity between vernacular and modernism has been seen as counter to received historical opinion about the rise of Modernism, beginning with Le Corbusier and his 5 Points for Architecture, which are seen as overturning 5 basic principles of Classicism. A demonstration in real time of the move from Nordic Classicism to a pure Functionalism is offered by Alvar Aalto's design for the Viipuri Library (1927–35), which went through a profound transformation from the original architectural competition proposal in 1927 (owing much to Gunnar Asplund) to the severely functionalist building, completed eight years later in a purist modernist style, influenced by Le Corbusier.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to air brake systems, all locomotives and rail cars {{are equipped with}} at least one hand brake. This is a mechanical device that applies brake shoes to the wheels to prevent them from moving. The effectiveness of hand brakes depends on several factors, including their age, their maintained condition, their application in conjunction with air brakes, and the force exerted by the person applying the brake, which can vary widely. The TSB estimated that somewhere between 17 and 26 hand brakes would have been needed to secure the train. Which if <b>there</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> two-man crew the crew {{would have been able to}} perform a stabilization test, which is all air brakes released and ensuring just the hand brakes will hold the train. Since there was only a one-man crew this test was not possible.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, the {{railroad}} gained {{a connection with}} the Kings County Elevated Railway {{by means of a}} ramp and short elevated railway. The connection connected with the Fulton Street Elevated, which ran from Downtown Brooklyn to Jamaica and was completed in 1893. From there the line bridged over Atlantic Avenue, where the LIRR was still operating at grade. As part of the Atlantic Avenue Improvement program, this portion of the LIRR was submerged in a tunnel between 1903 and 1905. <b>There</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> future connection from the Atlantic Branch to the Brighton Line, for which provisions were provided. This connection would have been for two tracks, but it was never built. However, space in the tunnel wall, a bellmouth, was provided for this connection. Then the line connected to the existing line several blocks to the south.|$|E
