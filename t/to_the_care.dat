30|$|By {{highlighting}} the mediated factors in delivering intergenerational support, this article also points <b>to</b> <b>the</b> different roles played by <b>the</b> obligation <b>to</b> <b>care</b> and <b>the</b> capacity <b>to</b> <b>care</b> in <b>the</b> <b>care</b> circulation system. <b>The</b> moral ethics of filiality and rural material sociality owing to long-established urban-rural segregation tied people within interdependent networks of family obligation and reciprocity. <b>The</b> obligation <b>to</b> <b>care</b> served as <b>the</b> driver <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rural Chinese <b>care</b> circulation system. However, in order <b>to</b> materialize <b>the</b> obligation <b>to</b> <b>care,</b> <b>the</b> capacity <b>to</b> <b>care</b> served as <b>the</b> energy resource <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> <b>care</b> circulation system operate.

5|$|Cadron-Jetté {{was born}} and raised in Lavaltrie, Quebec, and in 1811 married Jean-Marie Jetté. They had 11 children, several of whom died young. In 1827 she moved to Montreal and in 1832 her husband died of cholera. From 1840, in {{collaboration}} with Ignace Bourget (then Bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Montreal), she engaged in the charitable care of unwed mothers. At this time in Montreal, unwed mothers and those associating with them attracted a significant social stigma. Cadron-Jetté operated initially out of her own home and the homes of her children, and later, with the aid of other women, worked from a series of buildings known as the Hospice de Sainte-Pélagie. In 1848, she took religious vows, along with several other women, and founded a Roman Catholic religious institute known as the Sisters of Misericorde, dedicated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> of unwed mothers and their children. In 1849 she obtained formal midwifery qualifications. In 1853 the Misericorde Sisters built a convent on the corner of Dorchester Boulevard and Saint-André Street, and she lived there the remainder of her life.|$|E

5|$|The Childhood Of Jack Harkaway is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Adapted from S.

Given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>care</b> of strangers after his birth, Jack grows up and is sent to a school at age 12. After being severely and unjustly punished by the schoolmaster, Jack runs away and comes across two thieves plotting a robbery. Jack hurries to the house and warns the mistress of the planned robbery.
