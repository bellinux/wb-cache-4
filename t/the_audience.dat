5|$|Colbert {{received}} a chilly reception from <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, although some in <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> such as Scalia, laughed heartily as Colbert teased them.

5|$|Early {{suggestions}} were to show cutaways {{of just a}} {{small portion}} of <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> but the full effect was achieved by only showing the back of <b>the</b> <b>audience.</b> To save time, most of <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> models were borrowed from the previous Pixar film, Ratatouille. Additionally, Presto's body (from the neck down) is Skinner's lawyer, and the carrot was one of the many food props from that film.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{introduces}} {{himself and}} Bart to Kashmir, who is preoccupied with getting on stage for her performance, though she understands what Homer {{is trying to}} get through for his son. Without knowing it, Homer accidentally finds himself on stage at the burlesque show. Homer is about to be thrown offstage when <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> recognize him from the picture. <b>The</b> <b>audience</b> applauds and Homer gets caught up in the fanfare and starts dancing with the showgirls, until he sees Bart and realizes what he is supposed to do. Homer stops the show and successfully manages to make a plea to <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> to treat women with respect. Marge, who is in <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> accepts Homer's apology and the two make up.|$|E

5|$|Narayan's {{style is}} {{characteristic}} of Hindustani classical music, but his choice of solo instrument and his background of learning from teachers outside his community are not common for the genre.

5|$|Stefano Ghislotti {{wrote an}} article in Film Anthology which {{discusses}} how Nolan provides the viewer with the clues necessary to decode the sujet as we watch and {{help us understand the}} fabula from it. The color sequences include a brief overlap to help clue <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> into {{the fact that they are}} being presented in reverse order. The purpose of the fragmented reverse sequencing is to force <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> into a sympathetic experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories, where prior events are not recalled, since <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> has yet to see them.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} aspect of entertainment is <b>the</b> <b>audience,</b> which turns a private recreation or leisure activity into entertainment. <b>The</b> <b>audience</b> may have a passive role, {{as in the case}} of persons watching a play, opera, television show, or film; or <b>the</b> <b>audience</b> role may be active, {{as in the case of}} games, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of theatre or concerts; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of children's games. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with stage magic. Films and video games, for example, although they use newer media, continue to tell stories, present drama, and play music. Festivals devoted to music, film, or dance allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.|$|E
