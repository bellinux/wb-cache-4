By statistical analysis of empirical data collected through the Eurobarometer, I discover that {{there is a difference between}} how the relationship between the European identity and the attitudes towards <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> changes during <b>the</b> <b>Euro</b> crisis.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} Austrian and {{euro area}} opinion polls {{to assess the}} Austrian public’s views about the single currency five years after <b>the</b> introduction of <b>euro</b> cash. <b>The</b> analysis focuses on the following questions: How are Austrians managing with <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> now? How do Austrians assess <b>the</b> opportunities <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> offers? How did the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB) and other institutions cope with the communication policy challenges involved in the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>euro?</b> How good a feel have people developed for euro prices? How happy are Austrians with <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> compared with people in other <b>euro</b> area countries? <b>The</b> survey results show that <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> is recognized as a stable currency; it fulfills Austrians’ demand for price stability. People have largely overcome whatever problems they had using <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> in day-to-day transactions initially. The overwhelming majority of people are aware of <b>the</b> advantages <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> has for <b>the</b> economy and for them personally. People’s perception of <b>the</b> value of <b>euro</b> prices is getting better by <b>the</b> year; <b>euro</b> cash is widely accepted.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impacts of}} <b>the</b> <b>Euro</b> adoption in Slovenia on its tourism. For this purpose, the empirical research among foreign tourists in Slovenia was conducted on their perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>Euro</b> adoption in Slovenia {{during the second half}} of 2007. The multivari-ate factor analysis was performed, which confirmed the four common dimensions of <b>the</b> <b>Euro</b> impacts on Slovenian tourism: attractiveness, costs, expensiveness, and comparison. The mean values of the ana-lyzed items indicate the most positive impacts of <b>the</b> <b>Euro</b> on <b>the</b> direct price comparison and the easiness of comparison among tourist des-tinations in <b>the</b> <b>Euro</b> zone. <b>The</b> empirical results suggest that <b>the</b> <b>Euro</b> adoption has had the greatest impacts on better comparisons among tourist destinations in <b>the</b> <b>Euro</b> zone, followed by a significant decline in travel-operational costs. The increase in the expensiveness of the des-tination among foreign tourists is confirmed, whereas no significant improvement in the attractiveness of Slovenia as a tourist destination was proved after <b>the</b> <b>Euro</b> adoption.

40|$|Decimal {{fractions}} are the {{subset of}} rational numbers {{that can be}} written as common fraction with a power of ten as denominator (e. g., 2 / 10) or using the place-value system (e. g., 0. 2). Learning about decimal fractions is notoriously difficult for children. In a first study, we investigated the impact of prior knowledge and the developmental changes in the comparison of decimal fractions. We distinguished {{the impact of the}} value of the digits from the impact of the length of the fractional part on children's pattern of responses. Although both kinds of impact affected the success rate, the digit values had a stronger impact and were mastered later than the length. In a second study, we aim to investigate the age-related changes in rational numbers processing using three notation formats: decimal (e. g., 0. 5), decimal fraction (5 / 10) and fraction (1 / 2) notations. Results showed that fraction notation of rational numbers is mastered later than the decimal notation. A third study investigated the precursors of decimal fraction processing through a longitudinal study. Results show that the decimal system understanding was the stronger predictor of further performance on decimal fractions. In a fourth study, we investigated the impact of a problem-centered intervention based on the approximation of real numbers in the decimal system. Results indicated that the intervention led to improvement in both conceptual and procedural knowledge. Finally, we investigated the impact of <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> <b>symbol</b> on the processing of decimal fractions. The results showed that <b>the</b> <b>euro</b> <b>symbol</b> stressed the processing of the fractional part of the decimal part of the decimal as a natural number. (PSY 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|E
