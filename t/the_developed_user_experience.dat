We deployed two distinct content-based web services to explore information retrieval of time-shifted TV content.

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{there has been an}} {{increased}} number of media applications that have migrated to the cloud, which will enable mobile users to engage in rich media experiences from any mobile platform. In this research, we develop techniques to model and enhance the quality of service for two cloud mobile media applications: Cloud Mobile Rendering (CMR) application and HTTP-based adaptive video streaming. In CMR application, compute intensive graphic rendering is performed on cloud servers, and the rendered video is encoded and transmitted through wireless network to mobile devices. Although promising to address the computation and battery limits of mobile devices, this approach suffers from challenges posed by limited and unstable wireless bandwidth, such {{that it is difficult to}} ensure the quality of service. In this research, we first develop a model to quantitatively measure the <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> of CMR application, considering rendering factors, encoding factors and network factors simultaneously. Secondly we derive several techniques to enhance the quality of service, including a) an adaptive rendering technique which dynamically select the optimal rendering factor based on network condition; b) a prioritized encoding technique which allocates bits among different regions of video frame depending on their priorities; c) an encoding acceleration technique which utilizes rendering information to reduce the computation complexity of video encoding while maintaining the video quality. In HTTP-based adaptive video streaming, video content are split into a sequence of small segments, which are encoded into several versions with different bit rates and quality, and streamed according to the requests from streaming client. The version of video segments will keep varying according to the available bandwidth. Flucating bandwidth will lead to temporal artifacts such as video rebuffering (freezing), and spatial artifacts such as visual quality variation. In this thesis, we <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> first <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> model for this application through extensive subjective experiments. We validate with high accuracy the <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> model, and demonstrates its applicability to video with different length and motion characteristics...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the intended teacher use of a technology-enhanced learning tool, Web-based Inquiry Science Environment (WISE), and the first experiences of teachers new to using it and untrained in its use. The {{purpose of the study}} was to learn more about the factors embedded into the design of the technology that enabled it or hindered it from being used as intended. The qualitative research design applied grounded theory methods. Using theoretical sampling and a constant comparative analysis, a document review of WISE website led to a model of intended teacher use. The experiences of four middle school science teachers as they enacted WISE for the first time were investigated through ethnographic field observations, surveys and interviews using thematic analysis to construct narratives of each teachers use. These narratives were compared to the model of intended teacher use of WISE. This study found two levels of intended teacher uses for WISE. A basic intended use involved having student running the project to completion while the teacher provides feedback and assesses student learning. A more optimal description of intended use involved the supplementing the core curriculum with WISE as well as enhancing the core scope and sequence of instruction and aligning assessment with the goals of instruction through WISE. Moreover, WISE projects were optimally intended to be facilitated through student-centered teaching practices and inquiry-based instruction in a collaborative learning environment. It is also optimally intended for these projects to be shared with other colleagues for feedback and iterative development towards improving the Knowledge Integration of students. Of the four teachers who participated in this study, only one demonstrated the use of WISE as intended in the most basic way. This teacher also demonstrated the use of WISE in a number of optimal ways. Teacher confusion with certain tools available within WISE suggests that there may be a way to <b>develop</b> <b>the</b> <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> through these touch points and help teachers learn how to use the technology as they are selecting and setting up a project run. Further research may study whether improving these touch points can improve the teachers’ use of WISE as intended both basically and optimally.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the concept of}} Quality of Experience (QoE) {{in the context of}} mobile electronic consumer devices, such as smartphones. The modern smartphone is expected to deliver a high level of <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> across a wide variety of tasks, whilst remaining as power efficient as possible. Commonly, mobile devices undergo runtime optimisation to achieve the required level of performance, with the energy consumption being a secondary concern. In this thesis, we stress that it is vital to not focus on the raw performance of the device, but instead to concentrate on the needs and desires of the end user. This approach ensures that the end-user is satisfied at all times, and that the power consumption for a given level of <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> is minimised. Hence, we advocate user-experience-aware system optimisation. We introduce the concept of Quality of Experience, which has traditionally been used only in the telecommunications industry, to mobile system optimisation. We <b>develop</b> <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> models in <b>the</b> form of utility functions, and use these to translate lowlevel metrics into the delivered <b>user</b> <b>experience.</b> Upon these models we build simple, yet effective, QoE-aware Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) governing algorithms which adjust the performance and power consumption at runtime to meet <b>user</b> <b>experience</b> requirements. When creating our algorithms, we first analyse and characterise the operation of both CPU and GPU workloads. Specifically, we investigate how the level of compute-boundedness or memory-boundedness of CPU workloads affects frequency scalability, as well as determining how the available bandwidth and core count for a GPU affects the rendering performance. We combine both gem 5 -based simulation driven analysis and hardware-based verification in order to validate our QoE-aware governing algorithms. Additionally, we validate the operation of our algorithms using a variety of common mobile workloads. As part of this work, we have also extended the gem 5 simulator to allow use to investigate the potential for finegrained Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) adjustment, and use this as a platform to investigate the operation of the Linux CPUFreq governors used on modern mobile platforms...|$|R
