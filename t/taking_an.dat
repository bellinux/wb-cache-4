5|$|Barnes {{attended}} Stanmore Public School and, {{although not}} a scholar, was a keen participant in sporting activities.

An early controversy saw Barnes suspended for three weeks for disputing an umpire's decision.

He linked up with resistance groups in Bengal and Madhya Pradesh, while traveling to these states. He established contact with Lokmanya Tilak and Sister Nivedita. He arranged the military training of Jatindra Nath Banerjee (Niralamba Swami) in the Baroda army and then dispatched him to organise the resistance groups in Bengal.|$|E

Grenades were used for clearing trenches and dugouts, each battalion carried forward two trench mortars to provide fire support.|$|E

5|$|Einstein's future wife, Mileva Marić, also {{enrolled}} at the Polytechnic that year.

Over the next few years, Einstein and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was <b>taking</b> <b>an</b> increasing interest. In 1900, Einstein was awarded the Zürich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Marić failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions. There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{started in}} August 2006 at the Wikimania 2006 conference, and by April 2007 {{the team had}} {{aggregated}} 100 hours of footage. Co-director Hill accompanied Wales during 2007, filming him as he journeyed around the globe. Hill took a two-person film crew and traveled to China, Indonesia, India, South Africa, Australia and Europe, interviewing editors and contributors. Hill is himself an editor of Wikipedia, starting an article about a graffiti artist. Gibson and Hill required expertise in the creative and funding aspects of film-making and invited Scott Glosserman to join the venture. Glosserman's involvement with the film began during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. After Glosserman signed on, {{the breadth of the}} endeavor became larger.

Fears of mob rule associated with republicanism after the French Revolution of 1789, {{as well as the}} example of the recent July Revolution in France, led the Congress to decide that Belgium would be a popular, constitutional monarchy. The Congress approached several candidates, but chose Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, a minor but well-connected German noble, to be the first King of the Belgians. He was officially inaugurated on 21 July 1831, after <b>taking</b> <b>an</b> oath to abide by the Constitution. Leopold I was generally unsatisfied with the amount of power allocated to the monarch, and sought to extend it wherever the Constitution was ambiguous or unclear while generally avoiding involvement in routine politics.|$|E

50|$|Kinetic {{photography}} (kinetic meaning “caused by motion”) is {{an experimental}} photographic technique {{in which the}} photographer uses movement resulting from physics to create an image.

This can include, but is not limited to; holding and shaking the wrist strap of the camera while <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> picture, dropping the camera off of objects while <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> picture, throwing or spinning the camera up in the air while <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> picture (called a camera toss), or rigorously moving the camera while <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> picture, etc. As the photographer has surrendered control over the camera to physical forces, this technique tends to produce abstract, random or blurred-motion photographs.|$|R
