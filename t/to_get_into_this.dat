500|$|A common {{criticism}} of Majora's Mask {{is that it}} is not as accessible as Ocarina of Time. GameSpot, which awarded Ocarina of Time a 10/10, gave Majora's Mask an 8.3/10, writing that some might [...] "find the focus on minigames and side quests tedious and slightly out of place." [...] Game Revolution wrote that it [...] "takes a little longer <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> Zelda", but also that [...] "there are moments when the game really hits you with all its intricacies and mysteries, and that makes it all worthwhile." ...|$|E
500|$|Raymond {{took the}} war in Europe seriously enough to {{incorporate}} it into his strips, with Flash returning to Earth in the Spring of 1941. Jungle Jim found himself {{involved in the conflict}} too, fighting in the U.S. Army. Raymond was becoming [...] "restive about doing his duty", a restlessness increased by the knowledge that four of his five brothers were already enlisted. [...] In February 1944, Raymond left King Features and his work on the Sunday Flash Gordon/Jungle Jim pages to join the US Marines, commissioned as a captain and serving in the public-relations arm. Raymond is quoted as stating [...] "I just had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> fight... I've always been {{the kind of guy who}} gets a lump in his throat when a band plays the 'Star Spangled Banner'".|$|E
500|$|Giuliani {{became the}} {{presumptive}} Republican nominee, and by April 1999 {{had formed a}} formal exploratory committee for a Senate run. [...] There were still possible Republican primary opponents. Rick Lazio, a Congressman representing Suffolk County on Long Island, was raising money and had a candidacy announcement scheduled for August 16; he had openly discussed a primary against Giuliani, believing his more conservative record would be appealing to Republican primary voters. [...] In early August, under pressure from state and national Republican figures, Pataki endorsed Giuliani. [...] Pataki prevailed upon Lazio to forgo his candidacy, which Lazio agreed to despite frustration that Giuliani had still not officially {{announced that he was}} running; Lazio said, [...] "If the mayor wants to be a candidate, I think he needs <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> race. It's time to put the soap opera aside and step up to the plate." [...] Nassau County Congressman Pete King also considered running and had raised some funds.|$|E

500|$|An ode to oral sex, [...] "Blow" [...] {{stands in}} line with the {{explicit}} theme of the album about frank female sexuality and eroticism. Lyrically, it refers to cunnilingus through heavy innuendos omitting subtlety; the lines [...] "Can you lick my Skittles, it's the sweetest in the middle/ Pink is the flavor, solve the riddle" [...] are sung [...] "flirtatiously" [...] by Beyoncé. It opens with a breathy atmosphere and Beyoncé singing the lines, [...] "I kiss you and you lick your lips/ You like it wet and so do I/ I know you never waste a drip/ I wonder how it feels sometimes". The chorus lines are [...] "pleaded" [...] by the singer as stated by Fallon: [...] "Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me humming, keep me moaning". The second half of the song contains a tempo change with a funkier beat and the singer singing verse-chorus-verse trajectories. Chris Richards of The Washington Post compared this type of songcraft with Maxwell, Erykah Badu and Frank Ocean's work. It starts with Beyoncé declaring [...] "I'm about <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> girls. This for all my grown women out there". During this part, Timbaland's vocals can be heard in the background as part of a call and response. It follows with Beyoncé singing the lines [...] "I can't wait 'til I get home so you can turn that cherry out" [...] to her man; according to Caitlin White of the website The 405, these line [...] "exhibit deep assurance of her usual freedom". During the second part, the lines [...] "turn that cherry out" [...] are repeatedly sung followed by the lyrics [...] "I'm-a let you be the boss of me". She finishes the second part by delivering, [...] "Don't slip off when it drip off on top of you... Gimme that daddy-long stroke". The second part was further described as a [...] "masterful recreation of mid-'80s First Avenue funk". At the end [...] "Blow" [...] features a French-language interlude.|$|E

Rose, listed at that time as R. Hyatt in the phone book, was reportedly pestered at all hours by prospective suitors who'd seen Jeremy in Playgirl. [...] "She had {{to move out of}} her apartment for a month," [...] he has said. [...] "My father told me, 'If you want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> naked, crazy business, so be it, but if you use the family name again, I'll kill you.'"

Regenvanu stated [...] "I’ve been preparing for it for a while, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> Ministry", adding: [...] "I think eighty percent of my time will be taken up with cleaning up the mess that’s been left". He announced he would pursue the reforms which {{he had begun to}} initiate during his previous (brief) term as Minister for Lands.

2500|$|Two {{allegations}} were made against another Republican Congressman, Jim Kolbe. The {{first to be}} made public involves a 1996 rafting trip Kolbe took on the Colorado River with two recently graduated, 17-year-old male pages, as well as Kolbe's sister, five of his staffers, and Gary Cummins, the deputy superintendent of the Grand Canyon National Park at the time. An anonymous participant told NBC that he was [...] "creeped out" [...] by the attention Kolbe paid {{to one of the}} pages, adding that Kolbe did a lot of [...] "fawning, petting and touching" [...] on the teenager's arms, shoulders and back. The page in question declined to address that statement, telling NBC, [...] "I just don't want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>this...</b> because I might possibly be considered for a job in the administration." [...] He did say that he had a [...] "blast" [...] on the trip and did not report anything improper to his parents or page officials afterwards.|$|E

2500|$|Sherwood wrote {{some of the}} film's {{locations}} {{into the}} script as homage to Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III. As Sherwood explains, [...] "The original Leatherface, Chainsaw 3, took {{the idea of the}} backwoods isolation of the original and exploded it tenfold. I always think of the locations of this film—the scrub brush filled badlands and remote roadside outposts as feeling like another world—a dark fairy tale land in some way. I filled my story with similar locations to hopefully capture a similar vibe." [...] The fictional Sawyer farm is a key location in Leatherface, which was rebuilt to accurately resemble its appearance in the first Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The farm was originally going to be used sparingly, until Sherwood discussed the matter with directors Maury and Bustillo. Sherwood stated, [...] "Developing the script with the directors was actually just super-easy. We knew {{what we wanted to do}} from the start, and they got it and they were right along with me. I didn't have the farmhouse a lot and they were like 'If we are going to build the set and this is the famous farmhouse, we should use it' and I totally agreed with that. And so we moved the third act, mostly taking place at the farmhouse." [...] The Sawyer homestead was adduced by cinematographer Antoine Sanier as being particularly rousing to film: [...] "It's a real house that has been shot many times, but we cannot see it very well [...] It's always a little bit hidden or dark, so it was really impressive <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> <b>this</b> process and also to be a link to the other guys that have been shooting this kind of set." ...|$|E
