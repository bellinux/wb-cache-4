5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Creator,</b> after {{creating}} Aquaria, {{created a}} series of civilizations, making a new one in turn when each one was destroyed. <b>The</b> <b>Creator</b> kidnaps Li, with whom Naija has fallen in love, and she attacks <b>the</b> <b>Creator</b> to get him back. The player defeats the god as the final boss of the game, and returns home with Li. In the epilogue, Naija is shown with Li and their child. If the player has found all of Naija's memories by discovering places she remembers, they reveal that the shadowy figure {{at the beginning of}} the game was her mother, Mia. Mia was made by <b>the</b> <b>Creator</b> and had the ability, like Naija, to use the different powers of all of the civilizations. She fled <b>the</b> <b>Creator,</b> and hid herself and Naija among several communities in succession; after the destruction of the last one she erased Naija's memory so that she would find out the history of Aquaria on her own and defeat <b>the</b> <b>Creator.</b> In the extended epilogue shown if the player has found all of the memories, Mia appears, telling Naija that the two of them can conquer the civilisations above the water. After Naija refuses, Mia kidnaps her, and vanishes; the extended epilogue ends with Lucien, Naija and Li's son, leaving to find her. If the player has not found all of the memories, the epilogue instead ends with Naija asking the player to find out about her past, and revealing that the narration of the game was intended to be heard by her son.|$|E

5|$|Climbing the tower, {{the party}} discovers {{the remains of}} a family that {{attempted}} to reach Paradise but failed, and a library suggesting Ashura is controlled by someone else. They encounter him at the top, guarding the final door; he offers each of them control of one of the worlds, but they refuse and defeat him. Before they can pass through the door, a trap drops them to the bottom floor. Encountering the allies they made along their journey, they decide to rescale the tower. As they climb stairs that wrap outside of the tower, they engage each of the fiends revived and defeat them. They find <b>the</b> <b>Creator</b> at the summit, and learn that the fiends and the tower itself are actually part of a game created by him to see heroes defeat evil; for succeeding they would be granted a wish as a reward. Angry at his manipulation, they reject the reward and challenge <b>the</b> <b>Creator,</b> who insists that because he created everything he was allowed to use them as he saw fit. They then attack and defeat <b>the</b> <b>Creator</b> in a fierce battle. The heroes then discover a door leading to an unknown location; they consider entering, but decide to return to their own world.|$|E

500|$|After {{designing}} the show, {{the two had}} significant difficulties getting the series green lit. It was not picked up for fifteen years.

5|$|A myth {{about the}} Eye, known from allusions in the Coffin Texts from the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC) {{and a more}} {{complete}} account in the Bremner-Rhind Papyrus from the Late Period (664–332 BC), demonstrates the Eye's close connection with Ra and Atum and her ability to act independently. The myth takes place before {{the creation of the}} world, when the solar creator—either Ra or Atum—is alone. Shu and Tefnut, the children of this creator god, have drifted away from him in the waters of Nu, the chaos that exists before creation in Egyptian belief, so he sends out his Eye to find them. The Eye returns with Shu and Tefnut but is infuriated to see that <b>the</b> <b>creator</b> has developed a new eye, which has taken her place. <b>The</b> <b>creator</b> god appeases her by giving her an exalted position on his forehead {{in the form of the}} uraeus, the emblematic cobra that appears frequently in Egyptian art, particularly on royal crowns. The equation of the Eye with the uraeus and the crown underlines the Eye's role as a companion to Ra and to the pharaoh, with whom Ra is linked. Upon the return of Shu and Tefnut, <b>the</b> <b>creator</b> god is said to have shed tears, although whether they are prompted by happiness at his children's return or distress at the Eye's anger is unclear. These tears give rise to the first humans. In a variant of the story, it is the Eye that weeps instead, so the Eye is the progenitor of humankind.|$|E
