5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Kiss</b> is an oil {{painting}} on canvas {{completed by the}} Norwegian symbolist artist Edvard Munch in 1897. Part of his Frieze of Life, which depicts the stages of a relationship between men and women, <b>The</b> <b>Kiss</b> is a realization of a motif with which he had experimented since 1888/89: a couple kissing, their faces fusing as one in a symbolic representation of their unity. Exhibited as early as 1903, this work is held at the Munch Museum in Oslo.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Kiss</b> was {{exhibited}} in 1903 at Munch's show Love's Awakening, {{paired with a}} copy of his Madonna. The painting is now part of the collection of the Munch Museum in Oslo, Norway; the museum is dedicated to Munch and his works.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>kissing</b> post, {{supporting}} Ellis Island’s registry room, is {{a famous}} column at which millions of US immigrants reunited with family. At the registry room, {{final stages of}} the immigration process were completed. Then, as immigrants moved towards the pillar it marked a significant moment in their journey. Processed immigrants would search for family members who were to meet them at <b>the</b> <b>kissing</b> post. <b>The</b> once ordinary post was named <b>the</b> <b>kissing</b> post by staff members at Ellis Island {{in reaction to the}} [...] "joyful reunions" [...] and kisses between relatives and loved ones. Not only did immigrants endure the long passage to the United States but upon arriving they underwent a lengthy inspection process. This emotional process included physical exams, medical detentions, Board hearings for unaccompanied women and children and separation from family members. Seeing <b>the</b> <b>kissing</b> post at <b>the</b> end of their journey to America was an emotional conclusion to their experience. <b>The</b> <b>kissing</b> post signifies freedom, reunion and a new beginning.|$|R

This work is an {{anthology}} of very short works (on average 50–60 seconds) contributed by international film directors in which each used the original Auguste and Louis Lumière's motion picture camera to make his film. <b>The</b> <b>Kiss</b> is the 52-second film made by director Jaco Van Dormael featuring actor Pascal Duquenne. At the same time, Van Dormael was at work writing his next major work.|$|E
5|$|Sky and Lana {{start to}} {{trust each other}} a little, and during a sleepover {{organised}} by Serena, they discover that they both like black and white films. They bond, and Lana later watches Sky fall asleep. Sky realises that Lana has hidden depths and tells her. Lana gets upset and tells Sky {{that she is not}} hiding anything. Sky calls a friend who attended Wattle Heights High with Lana and finds out about the bullying that caused Lana to change schools. During a playfight at a sleepover, Lana suddenly kisses Sky. She runs {{out of the house and}} goes to the Coffee Shop, where she finds Sindi. Lana reveals to Sindi that she is gay. Lana admits that she does not want to lose Sky as a friend and tries to pass <b>the</b> <b>kiss</b> off as a joke. Sky tells Boyd Hoyland (Kyal Marsh) about <b>the</b> <b>kiss,</b> and Lana is later outed at school.|$|E

40|$|Many RNAs contain {{tertiary}} {{interactions that}} contribute to folding the RNA into its functional 3 D structure. In the VS ribozyme, a tertiary loop–loop kissing interaction involving stem–loops I and V is also required to rearrange the secondary structure of stem–loop I such that nucleotides {{at the base of}} stem I, which contains the cleavage–ligation site, can adopt the conformation required for activity. In the current work, we have used mutants that constitutively adopt the catalytically permissive conformation to search for additional roles of <b>the</b> <b>kissing</b> interaction in vitro. Using mutations that disrupt or restore <b>the</b> <b>kissing</b> interaction, we find that <b>the</b> <b>kissing</b> interaction contributes ∼ 1000 -fold enhancement to the rates of cleavage and ligation. Large Mg 2 +-dependent effects on equilibrium were also observed: in the presence of <b>the</b> <b>kissing</b> interaction cleavage is favored > 10 -fold at micromolar concentrations of Mg 2 +; whereas ligation is favored > 10 -fold at millimolar concentrations of Mg 2 +. In the absence of <b>the</b> <b>kissing</b> interaction cleavage exceeds ligation at all concentrations of Mg 2 +. These data provide evidence that <b>the</b> <b>kissing</b> interaction strongly affects the observed cleavage and ligation rate constants and the cleavage–ligation equilibrium of the ribozyme...|$|R

Many of Rodin's best-known sculptures started as designs of figures for this composition, such as The Thinker, The Three Shades, and <b>The</b> <b>Kiss,</b> and were only later presented as separate and independent works.

5|$|In {{worsening}} health, Smetana {{continued to}} compose. In June 1876 he, Bettina {{and their two}} daughters left Prague for Jabkenice, {{the home of his}} eldest daughter Žofie where, in tranquil surroundings, Smetana was able to work undisturbed. Before leaving Prague he had begun a cycle of six symphonic poems, called Má vlast ("My Fatherland"), and had completed the first two, Vyšehrad and Vltava, which had both been performed in Prague during 1875. In Jabkenice Smetana composed four more movements, the complete cycle being first performed on 5November 1882 under the baton of Adolf Čech. Other major works composed in these years were the E minor String Quartet, From My Life, a series of Czech dances for piano, several choral pieces and three more operas: <b>The</b> <b>Kiss,</b> The Secret and The Devil's Wall, all of which received their first performances between 1876 and 1882.|$|E

5|$|One {{consequence}} of the reassessment of sources is the reappearance of Troilus in his ancient form of andropais. Troilus takes this form in Giraudoux's The Trojan War Will Not Take Place, his first successful reappearance in the 20th century. Troilus is a fifteen-year-old boy whom Helen has noticed following her around. After turning down the opportunity to kiss her when she offers and when confronted by Paris, he eventually accepts <b>the</b> <b>kiss</b> {{at the end of}} the play just as Troy has committed to war. He is thus a symbol of the whole city's fatal fascination with Helen.|$|E
5|$|Rodin {{restored}} {{an ancient}} role of sculpture– {{to capture the}} physical and intellectual force of the human subject– and he freed sculpture from the repetition of traditional patterns, providing the foundation for greater experimentation in the 20th century. His popularity is ascribed to his emotion-laden representations of ordinary men and women– to his ability to find the beauty and pathos in the human animal. His most popular works, such as <b>The</b> <b>Kiss</b> and The Thinker, are widely used outside the fine arts as symbols of human emotion and character. To honor Rodin's artistic legacy, the Google search engine homepage displayed a Google Doodle featuring The Thinker to celebrate his 172nd birthday on 12 November 2012.|$|E
5|$|Rodin's {{relationship}} with Turquet was rewarding: through him, {{he won the}} 1880 commission to create a portal for a planned museum of decorative arts. Rodin dedicated much of the next four decades to his elaborate Gates of Hell, an unfinished portal for a museum that was never built. Many of the portal's figures became sculptures in themselves, including Rodin's most famous, The Thinker and <b>The</b> <b>Kiss.</b> With the museum commission came a free studio, granting Rodin {{a new level of}} artistic freedom. Soon, he stopped working at the porcelain factory; his income came from private commissions.|$|E
