Mathematical psychology contributes to the establishment of law-like rules that pertain to quantifiable stimulus characteristics and quantifiable behavior. Because the quantification of behavior is fundamental to mathematical psychology, measurement is a central topic in mathematical psychology. Mathematical psychology is closely related to psychometric <b>theory.</b> However, psychometricians <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> <b>concerned</b> with individual differences in mostly static, trait-like variables. By contrast, the focal concern of mathematical psychology is process models in such areas as perception and cognition. Mathematical psychology is intimately involved in the modeling of data obtained from experimental paradigms, making it closely related to experimental psychology and cognitive psychology.|$|R

They are also important for the theory of imperfectly competitive general equilibrium and the microfoundations of macroeconomics. Because observations of demand are likely to occur at the aggregate level, whereas economic <b>theory</b> has <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> <b>concerned</b> with individual behavior, the {{properties of}} aggregate excess or market demand are central to econometric identification. The importance of these projects for the development of general equilibrium <b>theory</b> can <b>be</b> seen in Kenneth Arrow and Frank Hahn’s General Competitive Analysis (1971). Soon after their book was published, though, Hugo Sonnenschein (1973) posed the following problem. Consider a function that maps prices into quantities. What conditions must this function satisfy if it is to be the aggre-gate excess demand function of a well-behaved exchange economy? The existence theory highlighted the importance of the function’s satisfying continuity, homogeneity of degree zero, and Walras’s law. Were these all of the restrictions on aggregate excess demand implied by the usual History of Political Economy 38 (annual suppl.) DOI 10. 1215 / 00182702 - 2005 - 02...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecent work in {{real-time}} concurrency <b>theory</b> has <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> <b>concerned</b> with languages {{based on}} message passing, and execution models which assume an unlimited number of synchronous processors. Practical limitations on processor resources often make such theories unrealistic. We provide a denotational linear-history semantics for a real-time concurrent language L, under realistic {{assumptions about the}} execution environment. L is a low-level language which contains shared variables and constructs for synchronization and selective mutual exclusion. Among the execution models we consider are limited parallelism, in which the number of physical processors may he less {{than the number of}} processes, and asynchronous processors, which need not run at the same conceptual speed...|$|R
40|$|The legal {{regulation}} of the environment is exemplary of the formation, practice and challenge of modern legal discourse and governance. The {{latter part of the}} twentieth century has seen the emergence of environmentalism and the problematisation of the environment in terms of the management of hazard and risk. The social authority of law has meant that it has been inevitably implicated in the contestation and negotiation of environmental governance. In turn, environmental governance and discourse have required a certain refiguring of legal rationality as legal discourse has been confronted by the immanent critique of environmentalism. This thesis will focus on how the environment emerged as problematic and how it came to be governed and of legal interest. Several examples of legal thinking concerning specific environmental problems are analysed, {{and the manner in which}} the environment is constructed within the legal discursive domain is examined. Much modern knowledge and understanding regarding the environment developed in part from the specialisation of scientific discourse and experiment, which formed certain areas of expertise, including biology, ecology and toxicology. This scientific knowledge significantly contributed to governmental identification and elucidation of the environment. Modern ecology and associated technologies have facilitated the detailed mapping and auditing of physical environments, and have profoundly effected our modern appreciation of 'the environment' as an interdependent, dynamic and potentially fragile web of interdependent physical zones, spaces and activities. Modern environmentalism has emerged through the application of this type of technical scientific knowledge, in combination with certain forms of 'environmental sensibility' which treat the environment, not as a thing, or somehow 'out there', but as a dynamic process of which humans are a part, which has a history, an economy, and a power to transform and be transformed. The shape of modern environmental governance has been especially influenced by the scientific and ethical critique of environmentalism that connects the origin of ecological risks to technological application and commodity production. Throughout this thesis, specific aspects of the 'analytics of government' or governmentality approach derived from Foucault's writing on governmentality are taken up. Governmentality <b>theory</b> <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> <b>concerned</b> with the contingent relationship between knowledge and power; thus, with analysing specific discourses and associated spaces within which differing knowledge and forms of thinking interrelate and resist each other. The contestation and negotiation associated with environmental governance has confronted legal discourse and led to a refiguring of legal rationality. Legal governance of the environment has stretched and unsettled legal orthodoxy, as the environment does not readily fit into any of the usual categories pertaining to legal rights and interests. The environment, as a legal subject, is not simply a physical space; it is a contingent and instrumental concept, determined by human activity, social values and legal and non-legal calculation...|$|R
40|$|Internationalisation <b>theory</b> has <b>largely</b> <b>been</b> <b>concerned</b> with {{analysing}} firm internationalisation {{strategy and}} entry mode choice from a manufacturing firm&# 039;s perspective. Nonetheless, as {{the composition of}} a firm&# 039;s product usually contains both tangible and service characteristics, {{it is important to}} understand the extent of service components that embody, or are embedded in, a product. This paper introduces the concept of service embeddedness, which is defined as the service characteristics existing in all products and are usually incorporated to add value to a product offering. From this perspective, the paper continues to outline a value chain that shows how value is created through a series of activities similar, but somewhat distinguishable, from the value chain generally applied to manufactured goods. A conceptual model is introduced to determine the likely impact that service embeddedness may have on a firm&# 039;s value-creating activities and its choice of foreign market entry mode...|$|R
40|$|Background Health impact {{assessment}} (HIA) and Healthy public policy (HPP) {{have been used}} interchangeably in discussions about the increasing interest in influencing public policy to improve health and health equity. This has sometimes conflated expectations about what each approach can deliver, limited {{understanding of the relationship}} between them and failed to identify wider influences on the practice of each. Critical realist methodology was used to identify and explain the factors underpinning the relationship between HIA and HPP. Methodology and Method Nine interviews and a workshop were held with international practitioners working in HIA and HPP. First, the empirical data was analysed using established critical realist analytic questions. Second, the empirically generated results were re-described using institutional public policy theory, specifically Howlett et als Policy cycles and subsystems theory which explains how actors (emphasising people and their relationships), ideas (emphasising content) and institutions (emphasising systems) all play roles in progressing HIA and HPP. Findings Empirically HIA and HPP were demonstrated to be separate yet overlapping entities, each of which has essential and contingent characteristics. Public policy presupposes both HIA and HPP, and five public policy characteristics were identified as influences. Seven other contingent factors influence HIA and HPP and the relationship between them. Against <b>theory</b> HPP <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> <b>concerned,</b> tactically, with agenda-setting and HIA, technically and tactically, with policy formulation. Focussing in on HIA, particular emphasis is placed on substantive and procedural dimensions of public policy making. The findings include the institutional structures and mechanisms acting as conditions surrounding HIA for HPP, how the essential features of HIA fit with public policy making, and how the essential features of HIA as a policy formulation instrument operate and can be strengthened. Three propositions are developed which provide summary explanations for these features. Conclusion Separating the essential elements of HIA and HPP from contingent influences helps practitioners and researchers identify what can be directly controlled or changed to improve practice, and what else needs to be planned for as contingencies largely outside the control of HIA or HPP practitioners. Further case specific research is recommended to test the findings...|$|R
