50|$|A <b>transductor</b> (not to be {{confused}} with a transducer) is type of magnetic amplifier used in power systems for compensating reactive power. It consists of an iron-cored inductor with two windings - a main winding through which an alternating current flows from the power system, and a secondary control winding which carries a small direct current. By varying the direct current, the iron core of the <b>transductor</b> can be arranged to saturate at different levels and thus vary the amount of reactive power absorbed.|$|E

The optical response of the detectors was analysed by VIS absorption spectroscopy, since a change of colour took place when the detectors were submitted to different pH buffered solutions.

40|$|Muscle tone of {{coronary}} arteries is regulated by free calcium {{concentration in the}} myoplasm. Various agonists, autacoids and putative peptides modify the calcium concentration directly or through actions of second messengers (signal <b>transductors),</b> such as cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP), inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate, diacylgly-cerol or calmodulin. For example, acetylcholine (in the presence of intact endothelium cells), alpha-human natriuretic peptide or nitrate compounds {{increase the amount of}} cyclic GMP and isoproterenol, prostacyclin (prostaglandin I 2) or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide increases cyclic AMP.

40|$|ADVANCES IN MAN-MACHINE INTERFACES BASED ON BIOMETRICAL PARAMETERS Man-machine {{interfaces}} {{are necessary}} for {{a great amount of}} useful applications for society and have been a particularly active area of research in the last few years. The many types of man-machine interfaces include those based on detection of eye movement and tactile interfaces with applications for aiding disabled people, virtual reality, robotics and tele-surgery, among others. The objective of this project is to research various relevant aspects in man-machine interfaces based on eye detection and movements and vibrotactile stimulation. In man-machine interfaces, based on face detection and eye position, utilization of moulds based on anthropometry of the face was researched with a particular emphasis on eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, eyelids and iris and face contour. As for tactile interfaces, parameters that enable achieving a better detection with a minimum energy use were studied. In interfaces based on face detection and eye position, moulds that allow a precise and fast detection of both the position of the face and the iris were developed. These moulds were named anthropometric moulds given that they capture the typical features of the human face such as mouth, eyebrows, eye region, nose and lower contour of the face. It was shown that these moulds are more robust to changes in illumination and background than other methods widely used for this purpose such as Adaboost and neuronal models (Rowley). It was possible to make a 3 D face and iris detection in real time by using a scheme in which moulds are organized in a cube from where they are extracted. Additionally, it was proved that using moulds based on directional images also improves faced detection. An alternative method for optimizing moulds through smart computer algorithms was also developed. Thus, through the use of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), it was possible to design moulds that are smaller in number of points than anthropometric moulds which results in a faster processing. What is interesting about PSO moulds is that they selected face features that where not obvious to visual analysis. They are generally points in the face that remain invariable and allow characterizing it. It was showed that PSO moulds are more spatially selective and have a greater amplitude response. This means that when applied on the image, they have a higher response when match with the face and their response decreases quickly when position of the face moves with respect to the PSO mould. Moreover, PSO moulds can be personalised to a specific face given that the algorithm is applied on a set of images that can be of the same individual. Results show that this method is better than other methods widely used in face detection, especially in images with non-homogeneous illumination and background changes. A method that enables extracting eye corners through a set of Gabor filters to use as fixed reference in the face was also developed. This reference allows measuring the centre of the iris in relation to the reference and thus estimate the position of the eye. This reference enables using a virtual keyboard operated through eye position. An electronic model that allows modelling power consumptions in <b>transductors</b> of electromechanical and piezoelectric type was developed under tactile interfaces research. Power consumption was determined for both types of <b>transductors,</b> showing a significantly lower consumption in the case of piezoelectric <b>transductors.</b> Power measurements were conducted by capturing voltage and current waves in a digital oscilloscope connected to a PC, to later calculate instantaneous power and average power. Detection thresholds of tactile stimuli in presence of noise were studied with results that cannot be explained by the classical theory but that can be explained based on the signal detection theory and the theory of uncertainty. Results show that detection follows a sigmoidal form ranging from non-detection to full detection and therefore, there is a detection percentage for different amplitudes of stimulus. The classical threshold is only 50 % of detection and thus there is no sense in using this threshold for calculating the power required to operate tactile interfaces. An experiment was designed that allows proving that classical theory does not explain measurements of tactile thresholds and neither explains the stochastic resonance phenomenon when the stimulus is immerse in noise.

40|$|Nowadays {{the devices}} {{employed}} to evaluate individual radiation exposition {{are based on}} dosimetric films and ter-moluminescent crystals, whose measurements must be processed in specific <b>transductors.</b> Hence, these devices carry out indirect measurements. Although {{a new generation of}} detectors based on semiconductors which are employed in EPD’s (Eletronic Personal Dosimeters) being yet available, it high producing costs and large dimensions prevents the application in personal dosimetry. Recent research works reports the development of new detection devices based on photovoltaic PIN diodes, which were succesfully employed for detecting and monitoring exposition to X rays. In this work, we step forward by coupling a 2 mm antracene scintillator NE 1, which converts the high energy radiation in visible light, generating a Strong signal which allows dispensing the use of photomultipliers. A low gain high performance amplifier and a digital acquisition device are employed to measure instantaneous and cum-mulative dosis for energies ranging from X rays to Gamma radiation up to 2 MeV. One of the most important fea-tures of the PIN diode relies in the fact that it can be employed as a detector for ionization radiation, since it requires a small energy amount for releasing electrons. Since the photodiode does not amplify the corresponding photon current, it must be coupled to a low gain amplifier. Therefore, the new sensor works as a scintillator coupled with a photodiode PIN.

However, small molecule inhibitors of the EGFR tyrosine kinase showed disappointing efficacy in clinical trials for glioblastoma. Here we aimed at investigating the molecular effects of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib on the EGFR signaling pathway in human glioblastoma. Twenty-two patients selected for reoperation of recurrent glioblastoma were treated within a phase II trial for 5 days with 500 mg gefitinib before surgery followed by postoperative gefitinib until recurrence. Resected glioblastoma tissues exhibited high concentrations of gefitinib (median, 4. 1 ?g/g), 20 times higher than respective plasma. EGFR-pathway activity was evaluated with phosphorylation-specific assays. The EGFR was efficiently dephosphorylated in treated patients as compared to a control cohort of 12 patients. However, no significant effect on 12 pathway constituents was detected. In contrast, in vitro treatment of a glioblastoma cell line, BS- 153, with endogenous EGFRwt amplification and EGFRvIII expression resulted not only in dephosphorylation of the EGFR, but also of key regulators in the pathway such as AKT. Treating established xenografts of the same cell line as an in vivo model showed dephosphorylation of the EGFR without affecting downstream signal <b>transductors,</b> similar to the human glioblastoma. Taken together, gefitinib reaches high concentrations in the tumor tissue and efficiently dephosphorylates its target.

40|$|The Positron Accumulator Ring (PAR) {{consists}} of 8 dipole magnets connected in series. These magnets are energized via one 12 -pulse dc power supply. The power supply {{consists of}} four phase controlled half-wave wye group converters. Each of the two half-wave converters are connected through an interphase transformer to obtain a full-wave converter with 120 {degrees} conduction. The input voltage for these two half-wave converters are 180 {degrees} apart. The two full-wave converters are connected in parallel through a third interphase transformer. This type of connection of the converters not only provides the required output current, it also improves the input power factor of the power supply. The output of the wye group converters is filtered through a passive L-R-C filter to reduce the ripple content of the output current. At low current values of the power supply the current ripple is high, thus a large filter is needed, which adds {{to the cost of}} the power supply, however at high output current levels, the current ripple is less severe. The large size of the filter can be reduced by adding an anti-parallel rectifier diode(D 1) to the output of the power supply.

40|$|Abstract Background Dysmorphogenesis and {{multiple}} organ defects {{are well known}} in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos with T-box transcription factor 5 (tbx 5) deficiencies, mimicking human Holt-Oram syndrome. Methods Using an oligonucleotide-based microarray analysis to study the expression of special genes in tbx 5 morphants, we demonstrated that GH and some GH-related genes were markedly downregulated. Zebrafish embryos microinjected with tbx 5 -morpholino (MO) antisense RNA and mismatched antisense RNA in the 1 -cell stage served as controls, while zebrafish embryos co-injected with exogenous growth hormone (GH) concomitant with tbx 5 -MO comprised the treatment group. Results The attenuating effects of GH in tbx 5 -MO knockdown embryos were quantified and observed at 24, 30, 48, 72, and 96 [*]h post-fertilization. Though the understanding of mechanisms involving GH in the tbx 5 functioning complex is limited, exogenous GH supplied to tbx 5 knockdown zebrafish embryos is able to enhance the expression of downstream mediators in the GH and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) - 1 pathway, including igf 1, ghra, and ghrb, and signal <b>transductors</b> (erk 1, akt 2), and eventually to correct dysmorphogenesis in various organs including the heart and pectoral fins. Supplementary GH also reduced apoptosis as determined by a TUNEL assay and decreased the expression of apoptosis-related genes and proteins (bcl 2 and bad) according to semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analysis, respectively, as well as improving cell cycle-related genes (p 27 and cdk 2) and cardiomyogenetic genes (amhc, vmhc, and cmlc 2).

The potential of nine isolates of entomopathogenic fungi was evaluated after determining percent germination and relative conidial hydrophobicity.

The {{results showed that}} isolates B 6884 and M 9374 had 44. 51 % and 39. 02 % higher conidial hydrophobicity compared with isolate I 03011 (least virulent). The results of nutritional index assays revealed {{a significant reduction in}} growth indices after infection with different isolates. Compared with control, B 6884 and M 9374 greatly decreased larval growth by reducing the efficacy of conversion of ingested food (36 %– 47 %) and Efficacy of conversion of digested food (50 %– 63 %). Furthermore, only isolate B 6884 induced 100 % mortality within 12 days. Compared with control, isolate I 03011, possessing the lowest conidial hydrophobicity, only reduced 0. 29 % of the efficacy of conversion of ingested food (ECI) and 0. 48 % of the efficacy of conversion of digested food (ECD). Similarly, transcriptomic analysis of genes related to the Red palm weevil (RPW) immune response, including pathogen recognition receptors (C-type lectin and endo-beta- 1, 4 -glucanse), signal modulator (Serine protease-like protein), signal <b>transductors</b> (Calmodulin-like protein and EF-hand domain containing protein) and effectors (C-type lysozyme, Cathepsin L., Defensin-like protein, Serine carboxypeptidase, and Thaumatin-like protein), was significantly increased in larval samples {{infected with}} B 6884 and M 9374. These results suggest that for an isolate to be virulent, conidial hydrophobicity and germination should also be considered during pathogen selection, as these factors could significantly impact host growth and immune defence mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{gives the}} review {{on the role}} of calcium in many {{physiological}} processes of plant organisms, including growth and development, protection from pathogenic influences, response to changing environmental factors, and many other aspects of plant physiology. Initial intake of calcium ions is carried out by Ca 2 +-channels of plasma membrane and they are further transported by the xylem owing to auxins’ attractive ability. The level of intake and selectivity of calcium transport to ove-ground parts of the plant is controlled by a symplast. Ca 2 +enters to the cytoplasm of endoderm cells through calcium channels on the cortical side of Kaspary bands, and is redistributed inside the stele by the symplast, with the use of Ca 2 +-АТPases and Ca 2 +/Н+-antiports. Owing to regulated expression and activity of these calcium transporters, calclum can be selectively delivered to the xylem. Important role in supporting calcium homeostasis is given to the vacuole which is the largest depo of calcium. Regulated quantity of calcium movement through the tonoplast is provided by a number of potential-, ligand-gated active transporters and channels, like Ca 2 +-ATPase and Ca 2 +/H+ exchanger. They are actively involved in the inactivation of the calcium signal by pumping Ca 2 + to the depo of cells. Calcium ATPases are high affinity pumps that efficiently transfer calcium ions against the concentration gradient in their presence in the solution in nanomolar concentrations. Calcium exchangers are low affinity, high capacity Ca 2 + transporters that are effectively transporting calcium after raising its concentration in the cell cytosol through the use of protons gradients. Maintaining constant concentration and participation in the response to stimuli of different types also involves EPR, plastids, mitochondria, and cell wall. Calcium binding proteins contain several conserved sequences that provide sensitivity to changes in the concentration of Ca 2 + and when you connect ion conformationally rearranged, thus passing the signal through the chain of intermediaries. The most important function of calcium is its participation in many cell signaling pathways. Channels, pumps, gene expression, synthesis of alkaloids, protective molecules, NO etc. respond to changes in [Ca 2 +]cyt, while <b>transductors</b> are represented by a number of proteins. The universality of calcium is evident in the study in connection with other signaling systems, such as NO, which is involved in the immune response and is able to control the feedback activity of protein activators channels, producing nitric oxide. Simulation of calcium responses can determine the impact of key level and their regulation, and also depends on the type of stimulus and the effector protein that specifically causes certain changes. Using spatiotemporal modeling, scientists showed that the key components for the formation of Ca 2 + bursts are the internal and external surfaces of the nucleus membrane. The research was aimed at understanding of the mechanisms of influence of Ca 2 +-binding components on Ca 2 + oscillations. The simulation suggests the existence of a calcium depot EPR with conjugated lumen of the nucleus which releases its contents to nucleoplasm. With these assumptions, the mathematical model was created and confirmed experimentally. It describes the oscillation of nuclear calcium in root hairs of Medicago truncatula at symbiotic relationship of plants and fungi (rhizobia). Calcium oscillations are present in symbiotic relationships of the cortical layer of plant root cells. Before penetration of bacteria into the cells, slow oscillations of Ca 2 + are observed, but with their penetration into the cells the oscillation frequency increases. These processes take place by changing buffer characteristics of the cytoplasm caused by signals from microbes, such as Nod-factor available after penetration of bacteria through the cell wall. Thus, the basic known molecular mechanisms for regulation of calcium homeostasis in plant cells are reviewed. Data presented in the paper is important for understanding the role of calcium in the ions’ homeostasis and can be used for developing high-performance technologies of crops nutrition...|$|R
40|$|The KRAS gene (Ki-ras 2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral {{oncogene}} homolog) is an oncogene that encodes a small GTPase <b>transductor</b> protein called KRAS. KRAS {{is involved in}} the regulation of cell division {{as a result of its}} ability to relay external signals to the cell nucleus. Activating mutations in the KRAS gene impair the ability of the KRAS protein to switch between active and inactive states, leading to cell transformation and increased resistance to chemotherapy and biological therapies targeting epidermal growth factor receptors. This review highlights some of the features of the KRAS gene and the KRAS protein and summarizes current knowledge of the mechanism of KRAS gene regulation. It also underlines the importance of activating mutations in the KRAS gene in relation to carcinogenesis and their importance as diagnostic biomarkers, providing clues regarding human cancer patients' prognosis and indicating potential therapeutic approaches...|$|E
40|$|Two main {{difficulties}} for amplifiers {{that attempt to}} make precision DC measurements are the inherent low-frequency noise of the amplifier and the leakage current of the amplifier input stage. This thesis presents a novel fully integrated operational ampli-fier design that addresses both measurement limitations by using a fully differential mechanical <b>transductor</b> input stage, fabricated using SOI-MEMS technology. The input stage of the amplifier is a MEMS structure that provides a variable capacitance to transduce a low-frequency input voltage into a high-frequency AC current. This up-modulation of the input signal is exploited to reduce offsets and low-frequency noise, and the dielectric isolation of the MEMS structure provides high input impedance and low leakage currents. To function, the MEMS-based amplifier includes two co-dependent feedback loops. The ‘drive loop ’ utilizes closed-loop control to vibrate the MEMS structure at its mechanical resonant frequency to produce a modulating capacitance. The ‘sens...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this work, we {{describe}} how the Erbin PDZ domain interacts with Smad 3, a <b>transductor</b> of the Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGFbeta) pathway, via its MH 2 domain. This interaction {{was described as}} important for TGFbeta signaling as it could potentially repress the transcriptional activity of the growth factor. In order to clarify our preliminary experimental observations pointing this interaction, we built a 3 D model of the Erbin PDZ/Smad 3 MH 2 complex and checked its stability using molecular dynamics simulations. This model pointed out charged residues in Smad 3 and Erbin which could be important for the interaction. By introducing point mutations of these residues within the proposed binding domains, we experimentally confirmed that arginine 279, glutamic acid 246 in Smad 3 and glutamic acid 1321 in Erbin are important for the binding. These data suggest a possible novel interface of binding in the Erbin PDZ domain and reveal an unconventional mode of interaction for a PDZ domain and its ligand...|$|E

40|$|Project for the Workshop Title: "The {{role of the}} retinal bipolar {{cells in}} the {{sequential}} processing of the visual information" Author: Carolina Varela-Rodríguez The retina {{as a model of}} the Central Nervous System: Since Cajal’s works were published the retina has been considered a model of the Central Nervous System (CNS) in reason of two facts. The first one is that the retina is {{the only part of the}} CNS accessible to the simple clinical exploration, and it is also very to perform experimental manipulations. The second reason is that it has a very well organised nature, so it has been quite easy to find some of the circuits that underlay the processing of the visual information. The understanding of the retinal information processing can help to improve the electronic-computational devices inspired in the CNS. The retina transforms the energy, from luminous to electrical and this to chemical. So, the visual information travels through the CNS and allows the animal to perceive the visible world. However, the retina is much more than a <b>transductor</b> of the light into electrica...|$|E
40|$|Con el objetivo de evaluar las técnicas ecográficas transrectal y transabdominal para el examen de la glándula prostática en perros, se realizó un estudio en 20 perros machos enteros, clínicamente sanos, de 1, 5 a 10 años de edad y un peso de 15 a 35 kg, los que fueron anestesiados con xilacina y ketamina E V. Se realizó la ecografía transrectal en un corte {{longitudinal}} con un <b>transductor</b> lineal de 7, 5 MHz y la ecografía transabdominal con un <b>transductor</b> sectorial de 7, 5 MHz. Los parámetros para comparar ambas técnicas fueron: a) posibilidad de observación de la glándula prostática, b) largo y alto máximo de la próstata, ecogenicidad y ecotextura prostática. La próstata se observó en todos los casos ecografiados con la técnica transrectal, a diferencia de la técnica transabdominal, en que se logró obtener cuatro imágenes completas, 11 incompletas, no observándose la glándula en cinco perros. Se encontraron diferencias significativas (P The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the use of transrectal and transabdominal ultrasonographic techniques for the examination of the canine prostate gland. Twenty healthy male dogs, from 1. 5 to 10 years old, weighing between 15 and 35 kg were used. They were anesthetised intravenously with Xylazine and Ketamine. The transrectal ultrasound was performed using a 7. 5 MHz linear transducer and the transabdominal ultrasound with a 7. 5 MHz sector transducer. The parameters compared with both techniques were: detection of the prostate gland, its length, width echogenicity and echotexture. The transrectal technique allowed the detection of the prostate gland in all cases. The transabdominal technique achieved 4 complete images, 11 incomplete images and in 5 cases the prostatic gland was not detected at all. Significant differences in prostatic length and width were found comparing both techniques. The gland was longer with the transrectal technique and wider with the transabdominal method. There were no differences between both techniques when comparing the echogenicity and echotexture. However the obtained image detail was better with the transrectal technique. It can be concluded that the transrectal technique gives better information regarding prostatic size than the transabdominal technique. The transrectal technique is rarely used, because a rectal probe and general anesthesia are required. In dogs, both techniques are important and complementary in order to determine prostatic image...|$|E
