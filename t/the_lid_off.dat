25|$|In 302 BC he {{returned}} {{a second time}} to Greece as liberator, and reinstated the Corinthian League, but his licentiousness and extravagance made the Athenians long for the government of Cassander. Among his outrages was his courtship {{of a young boy}} named Democles the Handsome. The youth kept on refusing his attention but one day found himself cornered at the baths. Having no way out and being unable to physically resist his suitor, he took <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>off</b> the hot water cauldron and jumped in. His death was seen as a mark of honor for himself and his country. In another instance, Demetrius waived a fine of 50 talents imposed on a citizen in exchange for the favors of Cleaenetus, that man's son. He also sought the attention of Lamia, a Greek courtesan. He demanded 250 talents from the Athenians, which he then gave to Lamia and other courtesans to buy soap and cosmetics.|$|E
500|$|With the {{financial}} and critical success of Jaws, Spielberg earned {{a vast amount of}} creative control from Columbia, including the right to make the film any way he wanted. Schrader turned in his script, which Spielberg called, [...] "one of the most embarrassing screenplays ever professionally turned in to a major film studio or director. It was a terribly guilt-ridden story not about UFOs at all." [...] Titled Kingdom Come, the script's protagonist was a 45-year-old Air Force Officer named Paul Van Owen who worked with Project Blue Book. [...] " [...] job for the government is to ridicule and debunk flying saucers." [...] Schrader continued. [...] "One day he has an encounter. He goes to the government, threatening to blow <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>off</b> to the public. Instead, he and the government spend 15 years trying to make contact." [...] Spielberg and Schrader experienced creative differences, hiring John Hill to rewrite. At one point the main character was a police officer. Spielberg [...] " [...] it hard to identify with men in uniform. I wanted to have Mr. Everyday Regular Fella." [...] Spielberg rejected the Schrader/Hill script during post-production on Jaws. He reflected, [...] "they wanted to make it like a James Bond adventure." ...|$|E

60|$|The box was of iron. On <b>the</b> <b>lid,</b> in <b>the</b> moonshine, Jeanie {{could read}} the letters S. P. Q. R., {{but she did not}} know what they meant. The box had been locked, and chained, and clamped with iron bars. But all was so rusty that the bars were easily broken, and <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> torn <b>off.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... “It’s {{like taking}} <b>the</b> <b>lids</b> <b>off</b> boxes and seeing ugly toads staring at you. In every one. Every one. That’s {{what it is}} {{having to do with}} men more than mere—Good-morning—Good evening. And if you try to avoid meddling with their lids, some of them will take them off {{themselves}}. And they don’t even know, they don’t even suspect what they are showing you. Certain confidences—they don’t see it—are the bitterest kind of insult. I suppose Azzolati imagines himself a noble beast of prey. Just as some others imagine themselves to be most delicate, noble, and refined gentlemen. And as likely as not they would trade on a woman’s troubles—and in the end make nothing of that either. Idiots!” ...|$|R
500|$|Chris Power of BBC Music {{compared}} Homework [...] "less-is-more" [...] {{approach to}} compression's use as [...] "a sonic tribute" [...] to the FM radio stations that [...] "fed Daft Punk's youthful obsessions." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that [...] "while a few tracks are more daft than deft," [...] more recent groundbreakers like The Avalanches could never exist without [...] "Da Funk". Ian Mathers of Stylus Magazine noted that [...] "there's {{a core of}} unimpeachably classic work on Homework, hidden among the merely good, and when you've got such a classic debut hidden in {{the outlines of the}} epic slouch of their debut, it's hard not to get frustrated." [...] Rolling Stone awarded the album three stars out of five, commenting that [...] "the duo's essential, career-defining insight is that the problem with disco the first time around was not that it was stupid but that it was not stupid enough." [...] Rolling Stone ranked Homework at the top on their list of [...] "The 30 Greatest EDM Albums of All Time" [...] while affirming that Daft Punk's debut [...] "is pure synapse-tweaking brilliance." [...] According to Scott Woods of The Village Voice, [...] "Daft Punk [...] <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>off</b> the [...] sewer" [...] with the release of Homework. Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork awarded it 7.6 out of 10. He stated that [...] "Homework provides sixteen whole tracks of modern-day boom box bass n' drum and unlike your science project, it doesn't require a lot of intricate calculations to figure out how it works." [...] In his view, [...] "It sounds like an Atari 2600 on a killing spree." [...] By contrast, Robert Christgau of The Village Voice cited [...] "Da Funk" [...] as a [...] "choice cut", indicating [...] "a good song on an album that isn't worth your time or money". Darren Gawle from Drop-D Magazine also gave a negative review, stating that [...] "Homework is the work of a couple of DJs who sound amateurish at best." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Cracker Line" [...] {{having been}} opened, General Hazen joyfully exclaimed [...] "We've knocked <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>off</b> the cracker box!" [...] By mid {{afternoon}} on October 27 the pontoon {{bridge across the}} river was completed by the 1st Michigan Engineers. Hooker's Federal reinforcements {{were on their way}} toward Brown's Ferry. Fearing that this attack was merely a diversion while the real Union attack would come from the south, Longstreet failed to counterattack immediately. Under pressure from Bragg, Longstreet would launch an attack two days later in the Battle of Wauhatchie, but this attack failed.|$|E
2500|$|The GLBT History Museum is {{honored by}} the editors for [...] "Best Queer Exhibitionism" [...] in the [...] "City Living" [...] section of the 2011 [...] "Best of the Bay" [...] issue of the San Francisco Bay Guardian: [...] "The {{first of its kind}} in the U.S., the sleek {{storefront}} gallery may be small, but it packs a huge emotional and educational punch.... The museum's lavender arsenal has ripped <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>off</b> the often-obscured queer past, and attracted tens of thousands of curious visitors (Britney Spears among them)." ...|$|E
25|$|A good cooking pot {{design has}} an 'overcook edge'which is what <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> lies on. <b>The</b> <b>lid</b> has a {{dripping}} edge that avoids condensation fluid from dripping <b>off</b> when handling <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> (taking it <b>off</b> and holding it 45°) or putting it down.|$|R
5000|$|Institutions can {{purchase}} ready-to-feed formula in containers {{that can be}} used as baby bottles. [...] <b>The</b> <b>lid</b> screws <b>off</b> and is replaced by a disposable teat when the formula is ready to be used. This avoids storing the formula with the teat and possibly clogging the teat holes when formula is splashed within the bottle and dries.|$|R
2500|$|In {{fast food}} outlets, ketchup is often {{dispensed}} in small sachets or tubs. Diners tear the side or top and squeeze the ketchup {{out of the}} ketchup packets, or peel <b>the</b> foil <b>lid</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> tub for dipping. In 2011, Heinz began offering a new measured-portion package, called the [...] "Dip and Squeeze" [...] packet, which can be opened in either way, giving both options.|$|R

60|$|The {{policeman}} lifted <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>off</b> {{the great}} pot, which was {{hanging over the}} fire, and stirred up the contents with a stick.|$|E
60|$|He jumped up, took <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>off</b> {{a pot of}} pea-soup {{that was}} boiling on the fire, and dropped the hated book into it.|$|E
40|$|Today {{is the day}} to give a party. That laundry case, the {{one long}} awaited from home, finally has arrived. Clean handkerchiefs, socks, and blouses are on top, but nestled among the sheets is a large box crammed full of surprises. Before <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> comes <b>off,</b> a few friends should be called in for an 2 ̆ 2 Opening Party. 2 ̆...|$|R

50|$|The Apple II was {{designed}} to {{look more like a}} home appliance than a piece of electronic equipment. <b>The</b> <b>lid</b> popped <b>off</b> <b>the</b> beige plastic case without the use of tools, allowing access to the computer's internals, including the motherboard with eight expansion slots, and an array of random access memory (RAM) sockets that could hold up to 48 kilobytes worth of memory chips.|$|R
6000|$|... "Kalubi-that-were!" [...] murmured {{our guide}} in explanation. [...] "Look, Komba has made my box ready," [...] {{and he pointed}} to a new case with <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{just saw}} that rascal {{go into the}} cook's galley. Jeff wasn't there, and Semmel took <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>off</b> of a big pot on the stove and {{sprinkled}} something inside." ...|$|E
6000|$|McLeod, who, {{from his}} speech and bearing, was evidently {{a man of}} some education, placed chairs for his visitors, took <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>off</b> a large {{canister}} of tobacco, and, pushing it {{into the middle of}} the yellow table, said-- ...|$|E
5000|$|One error {{can be seen}} in the Bateson's Belfry sequence. When <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> is {{wrenched}} <b>off</b> <b>the</b> casket and Lesley-Anne Down bends in to {{pull out}} her [...] "brother," [...] Donald Sutherland's eyes twitch from left to right.|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>lid</b> sprang <b>off</b> <b>the</b> coffin {{with the}} shock, and the {{carpenter}} {{woke up and}} looked out. He remembered the whole affair; {{he knew that he}} was dead and was going to be buried, and recognising the smith, he said to him, in a low voice, 'My good neighbour, if I hadn't been dead already, I should have laughed myself to death now to see you coming like this to my funeral.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1990s, {{just prior}} to their buyout by Seagate, Conner Peripherals started using a {{cost-saving}} measure on its low-end drives. Instead of bolted-down, cast aluminum lids with rubber gaskets, Conner Peripherals {{came up with a}} design that used a thinner stamped aluminum lid, and a thick adhesive tape seal along the perimeter of <b>the</b> <b>lid,</b> where <b>the</b> lip of <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> meets <b>the</b> base casting. This design used no screws to hold on <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> [...] - [...] just cutting the tape could permanently damage the drive by making <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> come <b>off.</b> This design was kept well after the Seagate buyout, and was discontinued in 1999.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh no, we shouldn't. The king is too good-natured. Of {{course he}} didn't mean {{a little thing}} like this! Besides, {{there is no need}} to lift <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>off</b> altogether. Just raise one corner so that I may peep. We are quite alone: nobody will ever know.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You've {{skimmed the}} cream, Hughie,--you and Dickinson and Scherer and Grierson and the rest,--I've only filled my jug.

60|$|He {{washed and}} dried {{himself at the}} sink, while she heated the frying pan on the front hole of the stove with <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>off.</b> As he wiped his hands he watched her keenly, and cried out with {{approbation}} as she dropped the steak in the fryin pan.|$|E
50|$|In turn, the war {{resulted}} in a major crackdown against the Mafia, helped by the pentiti, Mafiosi who collaborated with the authorities after losing so many friends and relatives to the fighting. In effect, the conflict helped blow <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> of secrecy <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Mafia.|$|R
50|$|Del Ponte {{received}} {{inspiration for}} Soma while hosting a dinner party. He was {{too embarrassed to}} display his plastic water filter on the table, and when he attempted to decant the water into a glass carafe, <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> flew <b>off</b> <b>the</b> pitcher and water spilled on the floor. While cleaning up the mess with a dinner guest, Ido Leffler (the founder of Yes To, Inc), the two resolved to create a water filter that is well-designed, functional, eco-friendly, and delivered via subscription.|$|R
6000|$|The {{authority}} in Holmes's voice had its effect upon the bearers. Peters had suddenly {{vanished into the}} house, and they obeyed these new orders. [...] "Quick, Watson, quick! Here is a screw-driver!" [...] he shouted as the coffin was replaced upon the table. [...] "Here's one for you, my man! A sovereign if <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> comes <b>off</b> in a minute! Ask no questions--work away! That's good! Another! And another! Now pull all together! It's giving! It's giving! Ah, that does it at last." ...|$|R

[...] She was holding out a little round box with <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>off.</b> [...] "Just wet your finger with it, and dab it gently on." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{was taken}} aback and did not reply. She took <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>off</b> the pot, stirred the contents, {{and put it on}} again. A savoury smell spread over the air. She looked at him once more, with a quiet smile which barely {{separated}} her lips; it was more a smile of the eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, make it lunch,' said I. 'I am hungry, and I do {{not want}} to wait to get up a dinner.' Anita agreed to this, and we went to work to take <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> <b>off</b> a hamper which she told me had been packed by Mrs. Parker and {{contained}} everything we should want for several days.|$|E
25|$|Where possible, a {{cleaned and}} freshly oiled Dutch oven should {{be stored in}} a clean, dry {{location}} with <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> ajar or <b>off</b> to promote air circulation and to avoid the smell and taste of rancid oil. If the Dutch oven must be stored with <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> on, a paper towel or piece of newspaper should be placed inside the oven to absorb any moisture.|$|R

While the Aurora was unloading, a violent whirlwind lifted <b>the</b> [...] <b>lid</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> air-tractor's crate, throwing it [...] The main hut was erected immediately, but the strong winds meant that work on the air-tractor's hangar was delayed until March. When the winds abated, a [...] by [...] hangar was constructed next to the main hut, from empty packing cases.|$|R
50|$|The film then skips to Daniel and his father's funeral, {{in which}} Mother Maiden wheels past {{the rows of}} empty seats and heads for Daniel's coffin, which has a framed picture of him on top. She places {{her hand on the}} coffin and it shakes violently, after which <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> flies <b>off</b> and Mother Maiden disappears. Daniel climbs out and leaps onto the other coffin, {{throwing}} his father's picture to the ground and smashing it. His split personalities also come back and climb out of the same coffin to join him.|$|R
