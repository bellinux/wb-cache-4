Diploma III Program of Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences University of Sebelas Maret Surakarta. Along {{with the}} {{development}} time and technology progress, people is charged tomeet the needs of development with the existing technology. People aren’thave {{to meet the needs}} of some of the shortcut, some people arethrough to get one with a crime to steal. With advances in technology, each person can be prosecuted for giving the solution of the problem with a good security system on the house door. This final project, it task is made a prototypeautomaticdoor using the AT 89 S 51 microcontroller with passwordenough guaranteed. AT 89 S 51 Microcontroller will receive a password from the keypad and the data are processby the microcontroller system thatthe data input compared with reference data. The match appropriate passwordwill provide a process that is done microcontroller system <b>toopen</b> <b>the</b> door and is driven by a stepper motor. Meanwhile, the alarm will turn on if the door is opened by force and microswitch providessecurity so the password can not be replaced easily. Therefore, the tool is one of the solutions that are secure enough in providing security at the door of the house. By using the keypad and microswitch as inputs, as AT 89 S 51 microcontroller control and stepper motor and the output as an alarm. For the greatest security is equipped with facilities to change the password and the security alarm system that will work if the door is opened by forc...|$|R
