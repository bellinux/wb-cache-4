A detailed view of the spectrum is shown in Fig. 1. Mode-locking is further confirmed by an autocorrelator measurement, showing a 55 -ps duration second harmonic generated signal at FWHM. The optical spectra of both laser outputs, i. e. from clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) propagation, are given in Fig. 2.

In the proposed configuration, {{the integration of}} the end-fed launcher and <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>waveguide,</b> rather than <b>the</b> waveguide in itself, acts as a basic radiator. This allows the design of more compact antenna elements. In order to analyze and optimize the structure, an accurate full-wave simulation tool based on the multimode admittance matrix representation is developed. Results are validated against state-of-the-art commercial CAD software. Numerical simulations involving singly and doubly tuned configurations are presented and discussed to illustrate the potential convenience of the proposed configuration and of the CAD tool developed...|$|R
40|$|The {{monolithic}} integration of four 1. 50 -mu m range AlGaInAs/InP distributed feed-back lasers with a 4 x 1 multimode-interference optical combiner, a curved semiconductor optical amplifier and an electroabsorption modulator using relatively simple technologies - sidewall grating and quantum well intermixing - has been demonstrated. The four channels span the wavelength range of 1530 - 1566 nm and can operate separately or simultaneously. The epitaxial structure {{was designed to}} produce a far field pattern at <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>waveguide</b> facet, which is as small as 21. 2 degrees x 25. 1 degrees, producing a coupling efficiency with an angled-end single mode fiber at twice that of a conventional device design...|$|R

AlGaInAs-InPmicrocylinder lasers connected with an <b>output</b> <b>waveguide</b> are fabricated by planar technology. Room-temperature continuous-wave operation with a threshold current of 8 mA is realized for a microcylinder laser with the radius of 10 mu m and <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>waveguide</b> width of 2 mu m. The mode Q-factor of 1. 2 x 10 (4) is measured from the laser spectrum at the threshold. Coupled mode characteristics are analyzed by 2 -D finite-difference time-domain simulation and the analytical solution of whispering-gallery modes. The calculated mode Q-factors of coupled modes are in the same order as the measured value...|$|R
