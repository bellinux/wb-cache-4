40|$|Nevirapine (NVP) is an anti-HIV drug {{associated}} with severe hepatotoxicity and skin rashes, {{which raises concerns}} about its chronic administration. There is increasing evidence that metabolic activation to reactive electrophiles capable of reacting with bionucleophiles {{is likely to be}} involved in the initiation of these <b>toxic</b> <b>responses.</b> Phase I NVP metabolism involves oxidation of the 4 -methyl substituent and the formation of phenolic derivatives that are conceivably capable of undergoing further metabolic oxidation to electrophilic quinoid species prone to react with bionucleophiles. The covalent adducts thus formed might be at the genesis of <b>toxic</b> <b>responses.</b> As part of a program aimed at evaluating the possible contribution of quinoid derivatives of Phase I phenolic NVP metabolites to the <b>toxic</b> <b>responses</b> elicited by the parent drug, we have investigated the oxidation of 2 -hydroxy-NVP with dipotassium nitroso-disulfonate (Frémy’s salt), mimicking the one-electron oxidation involved in enzyme-mediated metabolic oxidations.

40|$|Ohio The {{toxicity}} data {{of pesticides}} were summarized and compared amongst different animal species {{and types of}} bioassays. These comparisons howed the expected inter-species and inter-bioas-say variability. After quantitative and statistical analysis of these data, it was concluded that, on the average, a 2 -year dog bioas-say detected <b>toxic</b> <b>responses</b> at similar doses as a 2 -year rat study, and that both of these bioassays detected <b>toxic</b> <b>responses</b> at lower doses than either a rat 2 -generation bioassay, a rat de-velopmental toxicity study, or a 2 -year mouse bioassay. Al-though these chronic dog and rat bioassays were found to detect <b>toxic</b> <b>responses</b> at lower doses than the other studies listed, this analysis {{does not reflect the}} seriousness of the effects that were compared. Within the confines of this analysis, then, it appears that a 2 -year dog and rat study, reproductive and developmental bioassays are a sufficient data base on which to estimate high confidence Reference Doses (RfDs), and furthermore, that an additional uncertainty factor is needed to estimate RfDs to ac-count for this inter-species and inter-bioassay variability when fewer than this number of bioassays are available...|$|R

50|$|The respirable {{fraction}} of lunar dusts may be toxic to humans. NASA has therefore determined that an exposure standard {{is necessary to}} {{limit the amount of}} respirable airborne lunar dusts to which astronauts will be exposed. The nominal toxicity that is expected from ordinary mineral dust may be increased for lunar dusts due to the large and chemically reactive surfaces of the dust grains. Human exposures to mineral dusts during industrial operations and from volcanic eruptions give researchers some sense of the relative toxicity of lunar dust, although the Earth-based analogs have serious limitations. Animal and cellular studies provide further evidence that mineral dusts can be somewhat toxic. Earth-based research of mineral dust has shown that freshly fractured surfaces are chemically reactive and can elicit an increased <b>toxic</b> <b>response.</b> Since lunar dust is formed in space vacuum from highly energetic processes, the grain surfaces can be expected to be indefinitely reactive on the lunar surface. NASA predicts that this chemical reactivity will change once the dust is brought into a habitable environment.|$|E
40|$|Methyl-tert-butyl ether (MTBE), a fuel {{oxygenate}} that {{is added}} to gasoline, commonly contaminates aquatic systems, {{many of which are}} already contaminated with pesticides. The toxic effects (EC 50 value) of several pure pesticides (Diuron, Linuron, Dichlofluanid, Sea nine, Irgarol and tributyltin (TBT)) were measured and compared with the EC 50 value of the pesticide mixed with MTBE, using the Vibrio fischeri and Daphnia magna acute toxicity assays. The interaction between chemicals was evaluated in terms of the effects of mixing on the EC 50 value (i. e. the concentration (mg/L) of a compound or mixture that is required to produce a 50 % change in a <b>toxic</b> <b>response</b> parameter) and the time required to generate the <b>toxic</b> <b>response.</b> Presence of MTBE enhanced the EC 50 value of several pesticides (Diuron, Dichlofluanid, TBT and Linuron) and/or the <b>toxic</b> <b>response</b> manifested more rapidly than with pure pesticides. Toxicity enhancements were quite substantial in many cases. For example, the presence of MTBE increased the toxicity of Diuron by more than 50 % when tested with the V. fischeri assay (5, 15 and 30 min exposure). Also, the <b>toxic</b> <b>response</b> manifested itself within 5 min whereas without the MTBE the same response arose in 30 min. Presence of MTBE increased the toxicity of Dichlofluanid by 30 % when measured with the D. magna assay.

40|$|AbstractThis review {{examines}} the common theme of adaptive responses of bHLH/PAS proteins, using the dioxin receptor as a prototype. The bHLH/PAS family of transcriptional regulators are {{a group of}} key developmental and environmental stress sensing proteins. They employ a variety of post-translational control mechanisms to regulate their transcriptional output. Amongst this family, the dioxin receptor {{is best known for}} its ability to elicit <b>toxic</b> <b>responses</b> to dioxin and dioxin like chemicals even though it mediates more benign adaptive responses to non-toxic xenobiotics. We discuss what is known about dioxin receptor physiology, both adaptive and inherent, along with its molecular regulation and put this into the context of the wider bHLH/PAS family. We also raise the issue of its <b>toxic</b> <b>responses,</b> in particular the idea that it is the dysregulation of its poorly characterised housekeeping functions that leads to these outcomes...|$|R

40|$|The aryl-hydrocarbon {{receptor}} (AHR), a ligand activated PAS superfamily transcription factor, mediates most, if not all, of {{the toxicity}} induced upon exposure to various dioxins, dibenzofurans, and planar polyhalogenated biphenyls. While AHR-mediated gene regulation plays {{a central role}} in the <b>toxic</b> <b>response</b> to dioxin exposure, a comprehensive understanding of AHR biology remains elusive. AHR-mediated signaling starts in the cytoplasm, where the receptor can be found in a complex with the heat shock protein of 90 [*]kDa (Hsp 90) and the immunophilin-like protein, aryl-hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP). The role these chaperones and other putative interactors of the AHR play in the <b>toxic</b> <b>response</b> is not known. To more comprehensively define the AHR-protein interaction network (AHR-PIN) and identify other potential pathways involved in the <b>toxic</b> <b>response,</b> a proteomic approach was undertaken. Using tandem affinity purification (TAP) and mass spectrometry we have identified several novel protein interactions with the AHR. These interactions physically link the AHR to proteins involved in the immune and cellular stress responses, gene regulation not mediated directly via the traditional AHR:ARNT heterodimer, and mitochondrial function. This new insight into the AHR signaling network identifies possible secondary signaling pathways involved in xenobiotic-induced toxicity...|$|E

40|$|The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AHR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that dimerizes with ARNT to mediate responses to compounds such as 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD and other AHR agonists cause <b>toxic</b> <b>responses</b> in early life stages of fish, including the zebrafish, Danio rerio. The most well characterized target gene for the AHR/{{aryl hydrocarbon}} receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) dimer is a cytochrome P 450, CYP 1 A. Induction of CYP 1 A by TCDD has been correlated with certain <b>toxic</b> <b>responses</b> in developing zebrafish and has been postulated to mediate these responses. To determine whether CYP 1 A is the important downstream effector enzyme for the AHR/ARNT pathway, we used morpho-Embryonic exposure to 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a widespread environmental contaminant, causes systemic toxicity during embryonic development in many fish species.

40|$|The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AHR) {{plays a role in}} three areas of biology that include the adaptive metabolism of xenobiotics, the <b>toxic</b> <b>responses</b> associated with exposure to 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (dioxin), and vascular remodeling of the developing embryo. To test the hypothesis that receptor signaling in different cell types is responsible for these aspects of AHR biology, we generated a conditional Ahr allele where exon 2 is flanked by loxP sites. Through the use of Cre-lox technology, we then investigated the role of AHR signaling in hepatocytes or endothelial cells in mediating prototypical endpoints of adaptive, toxic, or developmental signaling. Using this model, we provide evidence that AHR signaling in endothelial/hematopoietic cells is necessary for developmental closure of the ductus venosus, whereas AHR signaling in hepatocytes is necessary to generate adaptive and <b>toxic</b> <b>responses</b> of the liver in response to dioxin exposure. Taken together, these data illustrate the importance of cell-specific receptor signaling for the generation of distinct AHR-dependent physiological outcomes...|$|R

Here we investigate the accumulation of TCDD in selected tissues of adult female zebra-fish and maternal transfer to offspring following dietary exposure to TCDD (0. 08 – 2. 16 ng TCDD/fish/day). TCDD accumulated in tissues of zebrafish in a dose- and time-dependent manner, except for brain.

40|$|The results {{presented}} in {{this study indicate that}} the <b>toxic</b> <b>response</b> brought about by increasing concentrations of tert-butylhydroperoxide in CHP 100 cells was mitigated significantly by exogenously added nitric oxide donors via a cyclic GMP-independent mechanism, In contrast with these results, endogenous nitric oxide generated by the Ca 2 +-mobilizing agent caffeine was found to increase hydroperoxide toxicity. Under these conditions, nitric oxide was not directly toxic to the cells, Rather, nitric oxide was found to promote the caffeine-mediated release of Ca 2 + from ryanodine-sensitive Ca 2 + stores via a cyclic GMP-independent mechanism. Release of the cation from ryanodine-sensitive Ca 2 + stores was causally linked with the caffeine/nitric oxide-mediated enhancement of tert-butylhydroperoxide toxicity, It is concluded that endogenous and exogenous nitric oxide activate diverging signalling pathways independent of cyclic GMP formation and causing opposite effects on the <b>toxic</b> <b>response</b> evoked by tert-butylhydroperoxide in CHP 100 cells...|$|E

The most toxic snowmelt samples were found to be high acute hazard (class IV), while the remaining samples were rated as slight acute hazard (class II). L. sativum (in the Phytotox test) was the most sensitive test organism, giving 27 % of all <b>toxic</b> <b>responses,</b> followed by S. capricornutum with 23 % of all responses.

40|$|The {{effects of}} pH and ammonia {{concentration}} were studied separately, where possible, {{on a variety}} of organisms, including some isolated from natural environments of high pH and/or ammonia concentration. Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis are both extremely sensitive to ammonia. An aerobic organism (growth up to pH 11. 4) from an alkaline spring is more resistant, but exhibits a <b>toxic</b> <b>response</b> to ammonia at a pH much lower than its maximum for growth. The greatest ammonia resistance has been found in an unidentified organism growing at near neutral pH. Even in this case, however, urvival at ammonia concentrations reasonably expected on the Jovian planets is measured in hours. This is two to three orders of magnitude longer than for E. coli. Results support the tentative conclusion that contamination of the Jovian planets with terrestrial organisms that can grow is unlikely.

Cocaine, {{one of the most widely}} abused drugs in the United States can both impair the functions of macrophages & CD 4 + lymphocytes and also activate HIV- 1 expression in these cells. Cocaine is a multifactorial agent that acts globally to impair the functioning of brain resident cells through multiple pathways. The drug not only promotes virus replication in macrophages, microglia and astrocytes, but can also upregulate CCR 5 coreceptor, and reciprocally inhibit its ligands, thereby increasing virus infectivity. Cocaine is known to modulate astroglial function and activation. Cocaine causes a myriad of <b>toxic</b> <b>responses</b> in the neurons: a) it synergizes with viral proteins, Tat and gp 120 resulting in exacerbated neuronal apoptosis, b) it causes calcium mobilization and, c) generation of reactive oxygen species.

Here, we evaluated the idiopathic nature and the predose prediction of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity using a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) -based pharmacometabonomic approach. Cisplatin produced serious <b>toxic</b> <b>responses</b> in some animals (toxic group), but had little effect in others (nontoxic group), as judged by hematological and histological results. The individual metabolic profiles, assessed by urine NMR spectra, showed large differences between the post-administration profiles of the two groups, indicating the relevance of the NMR approach. Importantly, multivariate analysis of the NMR data showed that the toxic and nontoxic groups can be differentiated based on the pretreatment metabolite profiles. Leave-one-out analysis, performed to evaluate the practical performance of our approach, gave a 66 % accuracy rate in predicting <b>toxic</b> <b>responses</b> based on the pretreatment metabolite profiles. Hence, we provide a working model that can explain the idiopathic toxicity mechanism based on marker metabolites found by NMR analysis consistent with tissue NADH measurements.
