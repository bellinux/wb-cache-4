5|$|Marshall held another {{press conference}} on October 17 to {{announce}} that the NAACP was requesting a formal government investigation into the working conditions <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> the men to strike. He called attention to three aspects: the Navy policy that put {{the great majority of}} African Americans into segregated shore duty, the unsafe munitions handling practices and lack of training <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to the catastrophic detonationand the unfair manner in which 50 of 258 men had been singled out as mutineers. when their actions concerning loading ammunition after the explosion were not significantly different from the other 208 men. Marshall pointed to the men of Division One who had refused to load ammunition prior to August 9, but had been shipped out and given other duty, not arrested and court-martialled.|$|E
5|$|Alboin's {{death had}} a lasting impact, as it {{deprived}} the Lombards {{of the only}} leader they had that could have kept together the newborn Germanic entity. His end also represents {{the death of the}} last of the line of the hero-kings <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> the Lombards through their migrations from the Elba to Italy. His fame survived him for many centuries in epic poetry, with Saxons and Bavarians celebrating his prowess in battle, his heroism, and the magical properties of his weapons.|$|E
5|$|During the 10th and 11th centuries Worcester spread north {{beyond the}} {{original}} burh walls, and south-east to form Sidbury. In 1041 Worcester {{was attacked by}} the royal army of Harthacnut over a tax-dispute <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> {{to the death of}} two of the king's men; despite the defensive walls, the city was successfully taken and burnt.|$|E

5|$|Wiggins' family {{initially}} attributed {{his death}} to lung cancer <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to respiratory failure.

Several days later, a physician disclosed that Wiggins' health problems were complications of AIDS. Wiggins stated that he had contracted the disease via intravenous drug use. He became the first baseball player known to have died from AIDS.|$|E
5|$|A {{doctoral}} student of Curie, Marguerite Perey, {{became the first}} woman elected to membership in the Academy– over half a century later, in 1962. Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia—the same <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to the Dreyfus affair–which also fueled false speculation that Curie was Jewish. During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right wing press who criticised her for being a foreigner and an atheist. Her daughter later remarked on the public hypocrisy as the French press often portrayed Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but would portray her as a French hero when she received a foreign one such as her Nobel Prizes.|$|E

5|$|After {{considerable}} argument, {{the decision}} to proceed ultimately fell to an unlikely political expediency. At the time, the UK was pressing for admission to the European Common Market, which was being controlled by Charles de Gaulle who felt the UK's Special Relationship with the US made them unacceptable in a pan-European group. Cabinet felt that signing a deal with Sud would {{pave the way for}} Common Market entry, and this became the main deciding reason for moving ahead with the deal. It was this belief <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> the original STAC documents being leaked to the French. However, De Gaulle spoke of the European origin of the design, and continued to block the UK's entry into the Common Market.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the First English Civil War Rupert was {{employed}} by the young King Louis XIV of France to fight the Spanish during the final years of the Thirty Years' War. Rupert's military employment was complicated by his promises to the Holy Roman Emperor <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to his release from captivity in 1642, and his ongoing commitment to the English Royalist faction in exile. He also became a Knight of the Garter in 1642. Throughout the period Rupert was inconvenienced by his lack of secure income, and his ongoing feuds with other leading members of the Royalist circle.|$|E
5|$|In 965 or 966, a Bulgarian embassy {{visited the}} Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II Phokas (r. 963–969) at Constantinople {{to receive the}} annual tribute that had been agreed by the two powers {{as the price of}} peace in 927. Phokas, flush and self-confident from a series of {{victories}} against the Arabs in the East <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to the recovery of Crete, Cyprus and Cilicia, refused to comply, and even had the envoys beaten up. He followed this up with a show of military strength, by sending a small force to raze a number of Bulgarian border posts in Thrace.|$|E

5|$|Others {{expressed}} a broader analysis, framing Lépine's actions {{as the result}} of societal changes <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to increased poverty, powerlessness, individual isolation, and polarization between men and women. Noting Lépine's interest in violent action films, some suggested that violence in the media and in society may have influenced his actions. Following a shooting at Dawson College on September 13, 2006, Globe and Mail columnist Jan Wong controversially suggested that Marc Lépine may have felt alienated from Quebec society as he was the child of an immigrant.|$|E
5|$|Political {{and social}} trends {{of the late}} 1970s shifted away from the early 1970s hippie attitudes <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to the genre's {{development}} and popularity. The rise in punk cynicism made the utopian ideals expressed in progressive rock lyrics unfashionable. Virtuosity was rejected, as the expense of purchasing quality instruments and the time investment of learning to play them were seen as barriers to rock's energy and immediacy. There were also changes in the music industry, as record companies disappeared and merged into large media conglomerates. Promoting and developing experimental music {{was not part of}} the marketing strategy for these large corporations, who focused their attention on identifying and targeting profitable market niches.|$|E
5|$|The WIYN Observatory's 3.5m {{telescope}} {{was used for}} speckle imaging on June 18, 2010; in addition, the PHARO camera on the Palomar Observatory's 5m {{telescope was}} used for its adaptive optics capabilities. These observations, combined with observations of Kepler-10's spectrum taken from the W.M. Keck Observatory, ruled {{out the possibility that}} a nearby star's light was corrupting the observed spectrum of Kepler-10 and creating the results <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> astronomers to believe that a second planet existed in Kepler-10's orbit. All of these possibilities, with the exception of if such a star existed exactly behind or in front of Kepler-10, were effectively ruled out; even with this, the Kepler team found that if a star was indeed aligned with Kepler-10 as seen from Earth, such a star would probably not be a giant star.|$|E

5|$|The main {{shopping}} centre in Sale, the Square Shopping Centre, {{was constructed in}} the 1960s. Following the Trafford Centre's opening in 1998, {{it was expected that}} the centre would suffer, but it has since prospered. In 2003 the Square Shopping Centre underwent a £7million refurbishment, {{a major part of the}} redevelopment of Sale's town centre. It was sold for £40M in 2005, by which time the Square had experienced an increase in trade and demand for tenancy <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to an increase of 70% in rental income. The town's economy expanded to the extent that in 2007, at a time when the rest of south Manchester was oversupplied with office space, Sale's available office and commercial space was at an all-time low because of high demand.|$|E
5|$|When the German Operation Nordwind {{offensive}} threatened Strasbourg, Pash {{ordered all}} captured documents to be removed. Papers indicating {{the nature of}} the Alsos Mission were removed or destroyed. Although Strasbourg was not abandoned by the Allies, and ultimately did not fall, the Alsos Mission departed the city on 8 January 1945. Pash even ordered an evacuation plan to be prepared for the Alsos Mission's main headquarters in Paris. The embarrassing series of intelligence failures <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> up to the Battle of the Bulge cast doubts on the Alsos Mission's own findings. A four-man team under Eckman was sent to investigate a suspiciously devastating V-2 explosion near Antwerp, and Fred Wardenburg had to confirm {{that it was not a}} small nuclear explosion. Rumors that Germany had an atomic bomb persisted as late as March 1945.|$|E
5|$|After the war Blamey was Deputy Chief of the General Staff, and was {{involved}} {{in the creation of the}} Royal Australian Air Force. He resigned from the regular Army in 1925 to become Chief Commissioner of the Victoria Police, but remained in the Militia, rising to command the 3rd Division in 1931. As chief commissioner, Blamey set about dealing with the grievances <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to the 1923 Victorian Police strike, and implemented innovations such as police dogs and equipping vehicles with radios. His tenure as chief commissioner was marred by a scandal in which his police badge was found in a brothel, and a later attempt to cover up the shooting of a police officer led to his forced resignation in 1936. He later made weekly broadcasts on international affairs on Melbourne radio station 3UZ. Appointed chairman of the Commonwealth Government's Manpower Committee and controller general of recruiting in 1938, he headed a successful recruiting campaign which doubled the size of the part-time volunteer Militia.|$|E

5|$|Beebe was {{relatively}} undeterred by the scientific community's acceptance of Heilmann's rejection of his theory, as {{is evidenced by}} the fact that he was still writing about his Tetrapteryx hypothesis well into the 1940s. His adherence to his theory was well-placed, as in 2003 a revolutionary discovery was made in the early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning, China: Microraptor gui, the small, four-winged dromaeosaur <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to renewed credence of the arboreal model for the origin of bird flight. This animal's most remarkable feature was the existence of long, pennaceous feathers on both its arms and legs, forming a set of four aerodynamic wings that its discoverers theorized were used for gliding. This discovery had the immediate effect of resurrecting the idea that leg feathers may have had some bearing on the origin of flight in birds, building on the idea originally proposed by Beebe and rejected by Heilmann.|$|E
5|$|First {{emerging}} in New York City in 2011, the Occupy movement was an international protest movement against {{social and economic}} inequality, its primary goal being to make the economic structure and power relations in society more favorable to the underclasses. Different local groups have different foci, but among the prime concerns is the claim that large corporations and the global financial system control {{the world in a}} way that disproportionately benefits a minority, undermines democracy and is unstable. It was widely seen as a reaction to the 2008–2012 global recession, an economic crisis <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to high unemployment across the western world, and was also inspired by the Arab Spring, in which popular protest movements overthrew the governments of several countries in the Arab world. Chomsky became a supporter for the Occupy movement, joining protesters at some of their camps and advocating their cause in the mainstream press.|$|E
5|$|Nixon, {{somewhat}} dazed by {{the conversation}} with Dewey, dressed for the speech and reviewed his notes.

Nixon later stated that Chotiner's promise broke the tension and gave him a needed lift. Senator and Mrs. Nixon and his staff journeyed to the El Capitan, where they were met by a cheering group of Young Republicans on the sidewalk outside, including future White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman. In Cleveland, General and Mamie Eisenhower, with the general's aides, prepared to watch the speech on television in the manager's office above the Cleveland Public Auditorium, where the presidential candidate was to speak.|$|E
