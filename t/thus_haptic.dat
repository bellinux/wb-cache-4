40|$|Haptic {{algorithms}} compute {{forces from}} a virtual scene that are displayed via haptic interfaces to humans. This chapter focuses on suited algorithms and on control approaches for stable haptic interaction and highly transparent haptic rendering. In haptic control systems, a fixed update rate {{is crucial for}} stability of the control loop. <b>Thus,</b> <b>haptic</b> rendering has to fulfil the requirement of deterministic computation time. Furthermore, high transparency requires high spatial resolution of the device's sensors and of the haptic algorithm. Haptic rendering based on the Voxmap-PointShell approach {{has the advantage of}} guaranteed update rates for collision detection and high resolution models, and is therefore suitable for haptic interaction. Stability of haptic interaction limits the displayable stiffness of contacts in a virtual scene. Thus, a non-conservative stability condition is essential for high-transparent haptic interaction. The presented method is based on exact calculation of stability boundaries, which is in contrast to the widespread but conservative passivity-based approaches for haptic rendering. </p...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{interest}} into non-visual forms of data communication, not only driven by the need for accessible representations but also because researchers are realizing the potential of understanding information better or differently through other modalities. <b>Thus,</b> <b>haptic</b> visualization is an immature but exciting area; it represents the abstract realization of information {{through the use of}} tactile or force-feedback devices. Through such a realization the user can gain quantitative, qualitative or nominal understanding of some underlying data. This paper presents the growth and development of haptic visualization, shows current trends, and acts as a snapshot of history. In fact, we remember the past based on temporal landmarks: we remember what we were doing when we heard the news of 9 / 11. Thus it is interesting and useful to look at the subject in the context of key events and seminal work. Moreover, it helps us to not re-invent the wheel: something that is far too common with interdisciplinary work. Thus, we take a holistic approach to the literature and place the research in context of important historic events and seminal work, which shows the reader where we have been, and points towards the future. 1...|$|E
40|$|To derive an {{estimate}} of surface slant, the visual system combines information from several cues, each weighted according to its reliability. We asked whether the weights change after providing haptic feedback consistent with one cue only. During the feedback phase of the experiment, subjects pushed a cube across various planes. The cube and the planes were seen and felt. Visually the plane had texture and disparity gradients specifying different slants. Haptic sensations for the cube and plane were provided with a force-feedback device (PHANToM); the haptic feedback for the plane was consistent with its texture gradient only. Before and after the feedback phase, subjects made slant settings (without haptic feedback) from which we determined the weights assigned to texture and disparity. The texture weight increased significantly from 25 to 38. We also conducted two control experiments that showed that the change in weight does not occur over time without the texture - disparity conflict and that the weight change was not caused by visual experience alone. We conclude that giving haptic feedback consistent with one cue causes its weight to increase in a purely visual task. <b>Thus,</b> <b>haptic</b> feedback affects visual surface perception.

[...] The haptic device allows the artist to have direct contact with a virtual instrument that produces real-time sound or images.

This can be done with physical modeling synthesis.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{demonstrate}} that touch decreases the ambiguity in a visual image. It has been previously found that visual perception of three-dimensional shape is subject to certain variations. These variations can be described by the affine transformation. While the visual system thus seems unable to capture the Euclidean structure of a shape, touch could potentially be a useful source to disambiguate the image. Participants performed a so-called ‘attitude task’ from which {{the structure of the}} perceived three-dimensional shape was calculated. One group performed the task with only vision and a second group could touch the stimulus while viewing it. We found that the consistency within the haptics+vision group was higher than in the vision-only group. <b>Thus,</b> <b>haptics</b> decreases the visual ambiguity. Furthermore, we found that the touched shape was consistently perceived as having more relief than the untouched the shape. It was also found that the direction of affine shear differences within the two groups was more consistent when touch was used. We <b>thus</b> show that <b>haptics</b> has a significant influence on the perception of pictorial relief. Human Information Communication DesignIndustrial Design Engineerin...|$|R

A 2 Degrees of Freedom (DoF) haptic force feedback system was designed for a dual-axes compensatory tracking task. The haptic system was used in a human-in-the-loop experiment with inexperienced participants on a xed-base simulator. In the experiment, participants were divided into 3 groups. All participants performed 30 trials of the compensatory tracking task. A group of participants (NoHA group) performed the whole experiment without haptic aid. The other two groups (HA 20 and HA 10 groups) performed a training phase with haptic aid, followed by an evaluation phase without haptic feedback. The HA 20 group performed 20 trials in the training phase, whereas the HA 10 group performed only 10 trials. The results show that haptic aid was benecial for performing the tracking task in the training phase for both the axes, compared to manual control. In the pitch axis performance of the HA 20 group did not worsen when the feedback was switched o, whereas a considerable deterioration in performance was visible for HA 10 group. <b>Thus,</b> <b>haptic</b> force feedback was eective to learn the control task in the pitch axis, compared to manual control.

40|$|Haptics {{is not a}} term {{well known}} to the public. It {{is derived from the}} Greek word 3 psij-æ|, meaning “to come in contact with. ” As a {{scientific}} term it is traced to the German wordhaptik, as employed by M. Dessoir (1892) meaning “the study of touch and tactile sensations, especially as a means of communication ” (Oxford English Dictionary). Nowadays the term has expanded in scientific use beyond touch, embracing the breadth of the earlier Greek meaning — having to do with contact forces generally. In this meaning haptics includes not only cutaneous senses of force, which are distributed in time and space on the skin surface, but also the aggregations of skin contact forces to form vector resultants applied to the muscles and tendons and joints, sensed by different receptors in these structures. <b>Thus</b> <b>haptics</b> has come to include kinesthesis (sense of limb motion), and also proprioception (awareness of self, or sense of limb position relative to the body and gravity forces). Some researchers have used the term tactual to embrace cutaneous as well as muscle, tendon and joint sensing, restricting tactile to mean skin senses only, for example see Loomis and Lederman (1986). Others employ both tactual andtactile to mean skin sensing. The lay public’s understanding of the term touch only adds to the confusion, since to many people it means only contact sensing on the skin, but to others it includes as well what they feel in and with their limbs. This profusion and confusion of terms may have discouraged scientifi...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{improved}} method for directly tracing a sculptured surface. This method extends previous work by adding secondorder surface {{information to a}} closest point tracking algorithm which greatly increases the stability and also improves {{the accuracy of the}} algorithm.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a 2 -DOF electrostatic haptic joystick designed for neuroscience studies in an MRI/fMRI. The joystick is fabricated using non-magnetic materials and actuated by two high-power electrostatic motor units which produce various force fields in the horizontal plane. The electrostatic motor is a synchronous drive and thus the positioning of the joystick is achieved in an open-loop control. As for force sensing, a 2 -DOF force sensor is developed using non-magnetic materials and optical fibers so as to measure interaction force with a user; hence, the haptic rendering is based on the admittance control scheme that respects the rule of force-in and position-out. The operation of both the actuators and force sensor respects non-magnetic principles. <b>Thus,</b> the <b>haptic</b> joystick into which these components are integrated is expected to have high MR compatibility, although the evaluation of the MR compatibility {{is beyond the scope of}} this paper. In this paper, the device performance is evaluated in the normal environment, which verifies the operation of the unique electrostatic haptic device. T I...|$|R

Touch is a powerful conduit for emotional connectedness, and <b>thus</b> mediating <b>haptic</b> (touch) displays have been proposed to address this deficiency; but suitable evaluative methodology has been elusive. In this paper, we offer a first, structured examination of a design space for haptic support of remote affective communication, by analyzing the space and then comparing haptic models designed to manipulate its key dimensions. In our study, dyads (intimate pairs or strangers) are asked to communicate specified emotions using a purely haptic link that consists of virtual models rendered on simple knobs. These models instantiate both interaction metaphors of varying intimacy, and representations of virtual interpersonal distance. Our integrated objective and subjective observations imply that emotion can indeed be communicated through this medium, and confirm that the factors examined influence emotion communication performance as well as preference, comfort and connectedness. The proposed design space and the study results have implications for future efforts to support affective communication using the haptic modality, and the study approach comprises a first model for systematic evaluation of haptically expressed affect...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} novel {{training}} method with haptic aids {{based on a}} Force-Stiffness feedback that decreases throughout the training. The novel training method was tested in a human-in-the-loop experiment. In the experiment, participants were split into three groups: variable haptic aid (VHA), constant haptic aid (CHA) and no haptic aid (NoHA). The VHA and CHA groups performed a first training phase with variable and constant haptic feedback respectively, followed by an evaluation phase without external aids. The NoHA group performed the entire experiment without external aids. Results showed that in the training phase both VHA and CHA groups performed better than NoHA group. In the evaluation phase tough, only the VHA group obtained better performances than the NoHA group.

40|$|In {{previous}} experiments, {{we provided}} {{further evidence that}} 3 -D face stimuli can be learnt and recognized across haptic and visual modalities. Our results suggested information transfer across modalities to be asymmetric {{due to differences in}} visual versus haptic face processing (ie, configural vs featural). To test this hypothesis, we designed two experiments investigating a visual, haptic and cross-modal face-inversion effect: Experiment 1 used an old/new recognition task in which three upright faces were learnt visually followed by three visual test-blocks (one with upright and two with inverted faces) and one haptic test-block with inverted faces. We found a strong inversion effect for visually learnt faces (visual-upright: d'= 2. 07, visual-inverted: d'= 0. 6, haptic-inverted: d'= 0. 52). When we exchanged learning and testing modalities in Experiment 2 (haptic learning of upright faces followed by one haptic-upright, two haptic-inverted and one visual-inverted test-blocks), we failed to find an inversion effect for haptically learnt faces (haptic-upright: d'= 1. 45, haptic-inverted: d'= 1. 75, visual-inverted: d'= 1. 16). Whereas visual face processing <b>thus</b> operates configurally, <b>haptic</b> processing seems to rely on featural information...|$|R
40|$|THE {{clinical}} {{skills of}} medical professionals rely strongly on {{the sense of}} touch, combined with anatomical and diagnostic knowledge. Haptic exploratory procedures allow the expert to detect anomalies via gross and fine palpation, squeezing, and contour following. Haptic feedback is also key to medical interventions, for example when an anaesthetist inserts an epidural needle, a surgeon makes an incision, a dental surgeon drills into a carious lesion, or a veterinarian sutures a wound. Yet, current trends in medical technology and training methods involve less haptic feedback to clinicians and trainees. For example, minimally invasive surgery removes the direct contact between the patient and clinician that gives rise to natural haptic feedback, and furthermore introduces scaling and rotational transforms that confuse the relationship between movements of the hand and the surgical site. Similarly, {{it is thought that}} computer-based medical simulation and training systems require high-resolution and realistic haptic feedback to the trainee for significant training transfer to occur. The science and technology of <b>haptics</b> <b>thus</b> has great potential to affect the performance of medical procedures and learning of clinical skills.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that if multiple cues provide information about the same quantity, the information from these cues is combined by weighting each cue by the inverse of its variance. This implies that cue weights {{are determined by the}} cue variances only. However, this view is challenged by studies that showed that feedback about the actual value can induce changes in the cue weights when the feedback is consistent with one cue but not the other. We developed a paradigm that allowed us to measure the time course of this reweighting. Subjects placed an object flush onto a slanted surface. Monocular and binocular cues provided information about the slant and could be inconsistent with one another. Subjects received haptic feedback about whether they had oriented the object correctly when the object contacted the surface. This feedback was consistent with either the monocular or the binocular information. We found that the weight given to the visual cue that was consistent with the feedback increased relatively fast, leading to a mean weight change of 0. 18 after 52 conflict trials. <b>Thus,</b> unless the <b>haptic</b> feedback somehow influences the reliability of the individual visual cues, the cue weights are not fully determined by the cue variances but also depend on the accuracy of each cue...|$|R
40|$|How well can {{designers}} communicate {{qualities of}} touch? This paper presents {{evidence that they}} have some capability to do so, much of which {{appears to have been}} learned, but at present make limited use of such language. Interviews with graduate designer-makers suggest that they are aware of and value the importance of touch and materiality in their work, but lack a vocabulary to fully relate to their detailed explanations of other aspects such as their intent or selection of materials. We believe that more attention should be paid to the verbal dialogue that happens in the design process, particularly as other researchers show that even making-based learning also has a strong verbal element to it. However, verbal language alone {{does not appear to be}} adequate for a comprehensive language of touch. Graduate designers-makers’ descriptive practices combined non-verbal manipulation within verbal accounts. We <b>thus</b> argue that <b>haptic</b> vocabularies do not simply describe material qualities, but rather are situated competences that physically demonstrate the presence of haptic qualities. Such competencies are more important than groups of verbal vocabularies in isolation. Design support for developing and extending haptic competences must take this wide range of considerations into account to comprehensively improve designers’ capabilities...|$|R
40|$|The haptic-based sensing {{technology}} (HST) {{has the potential}} to be a powerful tool in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). When developing a new product, the trend is to compress product development cycles and reduce costs. Virtual modeling, sometimes referred as digital prototyping, is widely used in industry for simulating the visual appearance and functionalities.

40|$|The Tactile Internet is at {{the core}} of the 5 G era, when the world will experience {{paradigm}} shift from content-delivery networks to service/labour-delivery ones. Systems that enable wireless communications of haptic data feature bi-directionality, high packet rate and resolution, large degrees of freedom, and above all, strict latency requirements in many applications, aggravating the shortage of wireless resources. <b>Thus,</b> more efficient <b>haptic</b> data reduction techniques are continuously summoned for. Previous studies  on haptic compression mostly resort to DPCM/ADPCM plus entropy coding and perception-based down-sampling for real-time scenarios, and model-based techniques such as DCT and LP for the rest. However, with few exceptions they always segregate tactile signals from kinaesthetic signals, employing only kinaesthetic feedbacks in real-time compression experiments. In addition, these techniques are not optimized for efficient performance at scale.  This thesis project proposes a novel multi-channel real-time haptic compression system aimed at teleoperation applications with both kinaesthetic and tactile feedbacks. It consists of a lossy compression layer featuring predictive coding and a lossless layer featuring channel reshuffle and group transmission. By using different quantizer designs in the lossy layer, it abates the need for entropy coding, and leave room for future perception-based data compression modules. The lossless layer exploits inter-channel sparsity for further data reduction. The system is evaluated on a tactile texture database published by University of Pennsylvania in MATLAB.

40|$|Kinesthetic haptic devices {{can make}} us feel that we are {{touching}} or holding objects that are not actually there by applying a force directly onto a user's body. As a corollary of Newton's third law, these devices are typically attached to the ground or else {{they would not be}} able to apply a net force onto a user. <b>Thus,</b> kinesthetic <b>haptic</b> devices typically have small workspaces-the area in which they can be used-or are overly cumbersome and expensive. Consequently, they are incompatible with room-scale virtual reality, which allows users to move and walk within a room. The portable haptics interface overcomes this limitation because its wearable form factor means it's "grounded" directly to a user's back, making it portable. In other words, this device approximates the sensations of a kinesthetic haptic device while also being portable. The haptic device consists of a robotic arm that is mounted on a user's back, and its end-effector is attached to an HTC Vive controller, enabling use with virtual reality. A first example application uses the portable haptics interface to simulate the elasticity of a bow and arrow as a user pulls on the bowstring of a virtual bow. A second application renders haptic feedback for impacts by applying an impulse of in the appropriate direction when a user hits a tennis ball with a racket in virtual reality. In an evaluation, we asked users to shoot targets in virtual reality with and without haptic feedback. Our results suggest that haptic feedback increases spatial presence with a large effect size but does not affect involvement and experienced realism. Our results also suggest several improvements to the ergonomics of the system such as using thicker straps to better distribute the load. In summary, portable kinesthetic haptic devices such as the portable haptics interface provide room-scale virtual reality applications with the sense of touch without constraining users to a chair. by Andres Calvo.

Key Words: Contact, Fixation, Haptic, Stabilization, Technique The eyelets on the polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) intraocular lens (IOL) haptics permit sutures to be placed easily at symmetrical points. Various four-point fixation techniques using the eyelets have been shown to yield better stability and prevent tilt. 1 - 5 Suture fixation of PMMA IOLs requires at least 6. 0 mm incisions, so many authors have recently used foldable IOLs for suture fixation through a small incision. 6 - 8 However, foldable IOLs are manufactured in a form that has no eyelets on the <b>haptics.</b> <b>Thus,</b> tying the sutures at symmetrical haptic points can be technically difficult.

However, it has not yet been determined if suture fixation using the acrylic haptics results in stability of the IOL, which is very flexible.
