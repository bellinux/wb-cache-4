5|$|From 1820 to 1850, Jacksonian {{democracy}} began a set {{of reforms}} which included wider white male suffrage; {{it led to the}} rise of the Second Party System of Democrats and Whigs as the dominant parties from 1828 to 1854. <b>The</b> <b>Trail</b> <b>of</b> Tears in the 1830s exemplified the Indian removal policy that resettled Indians into the west on Indian reservations. The U.S. annexed the Republic of Texas in 1845 during a period of expansionist Manifest destiny. The 1846 Oregon Treaty with Britain led to U.S. control of the present-day American Northwest. Victory in the Mexican–American War resulted in the 1848 Mexican Cession of California and much of the present-day American Southwest.|$|E

Johnston was puzzled by the okapi tracks the natives showed him; while he had expected to be on <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>of</b> some sort of forest-dwelling horse, the tracks were of a cloven-hoofed beast.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in New York, Häyhänen {{spent the next}} two years establishing his identity. During that time he received money from his superiors left in dead-letter boxes in the Bronx and Manhattan. It is known he occasionally drew attention to himself by indulging in heavy drinking sessions and heated arguments with his Finnish wife Hannah. For six months Häyhänen checked the thumbtack and no one had made contact. He also checked a dead-drop location he had memorized. There he found a hollowed-out nickel. However, prior to opening the coin Häyhänen had misplaced it, either buying a newspaper with it or using it as a subway token. For the next seven months the hollow nickel travelled around the New York City economy, unopened. <b>The</b> <b>trail</b> <b>of</b> the hollow nickel ended when a thirteen-year-old newsboy was collecting for his weekly deliveries. The newsboy accidentally dropped the nickel and it broke in half, revealing a microphotograph containing a series of numbers. The newsboy handed the nickel to a New York detective, who in turn forwarded it to the FBI. From 1953 to 1957, though every effort was made to decipher the microphotograph, the FBI was unable to solve the mystery.|$|E
5|$|Arson {{investigators}} testified as to {{how they}} had located the origin and cause of the house fire, stressing that the multiple unconnected, small fires they had found in the home's basement were evidence of the fire having been set purposely and that char patterns on the house's floors were evidence of a liquid accelerant having been used to start the fire. The living room floor had contained the most significant amount of accelerant, and <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>of</b> accelerant had ended {{at the door of the}} master bedroom, which had been open while the fire burned. The state of the bedroom door contradicted Green's prior testimony to investigators that her bedroom door had been closed and she had only opened it briefly to look into the hallway.|$|E

5|$|Francis {{spends most}} of the season as the newly {{appointed}} Vice President of the United States. In early episodes Frank vanquishes reporters on <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>of</b> a murder he committed in the previous season. However, the drama soon shifts to tensions involving Frank, President Walker, the Chinese government, and the wealthy Raymond Tusk, eventually culminating in a bitter political war between Frank and Tusk.

The most significant new character is Jackie Sharp, Frank's successor as House Whip, who soon finds herself embroiled in Frank's plans. As the war between Frank and Tusk consumes the Presidency, things culminate in a scandal that leads to Walker resigning, Tusk being arrested, and Frank ascending to the Oval Office.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, a geisha {{was paid}} {{for the number of}} senkodokei (incense sticks) that had been {{consumed}} while she was present, a practice which continued until 1924. Incense seal clocks were used for similar occasions and events as the stick clock; while religious purposes were of primary importance, these clocks were also popular at social gatherings, and were used by Chinese scholars and intellectuals. The seal was a wooden or stone disk with one or more grooves etched in it into which incense was placed. These clocks were common in China, but were produced in fewer numbers in Japan. To signal the passage of a specific amount of time, small pieces of fragrant woods, resins, or different scented incenses could be placed on the incense powder trails. Different powdered incense clocks used different formulations of incense, depending on how the clock was laid out. The length of <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>of</b> incense, directly related {{to the size of the}} seal, was the primary factor in determining how long the clock would last; all burned for long periods of time, ranging between 12 hours and a month.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> <b>of</b> {{the related}} {{negative}} publicity, Turner accepted {{the lead role}} in Ross Hunter's remake of Imitation of Life (1959) {{under the direction of}} Douglas Sirk. Universal Studios capitalized on her new-found notoriety; the result {{was one of the biggest}} hits of the year, and the biggest of Turner's career; she owned 50% of the earnings of the picture and during just the first year of the film's release she earned $11 million. According to Hunter, the film made an excess of $50 million in box office receipts. Critics and audiences could not help noticing that the plots of Peyton Place and Imitation of Life each seemed to mirror certain parts of Turner's private life. Specifically, both films depicted the troubled, complicated relationship between a single mother and her teenaged daughter.|$|E
