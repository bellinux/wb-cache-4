One must be careful {{to ensure that the}} <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entireties designation is chosen as opposed to other forms of joint ownership such as joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, so that the benefits of <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entireties status is not lost. For example, under Florida law, if a bank account titling document allows for <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entireties and joint tenancy with rights of survivorship, if the account is opened as a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship account, the benefits of <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> entireties will not attach.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the {{entirety}} (sometimes called a <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entireties) {{is a type}} of concurrent estate formerly available only to married couples, where ownership of property is treated as though the couple were a single legal person. (In the State of Hawaii, the option of Tenants by the Entirety ownership is also available to domestic partners in a registered [...] "Reciprocal Beneficiary Relationship"; Vermont's Civil Union statute qualifies parties to a civil union for <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> {{the entirety}}.) Like a Joint Tenancy with Rights of Survivorship, the <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entirety also encompasses a right of survivorship, so if one spouse dies, the entire interest in the property is said to [...] "ripen" [...] in the survivor so that sole control of the property ripens, or passes in the ordinary sense, to the surviving spouse without going through probate.|$|R

5000|$|In some jurisdictions, {{to create}} a <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the {{entirety}} the parties must specify in the deed that the property is being conveyed to the couple [...] "as tenants by the entirety," [...] while in others, a conveyance to a married couple is presumed {{to create a}} <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entirety unless the deed specifies otherwise. (see also Sociedad de gananciales) Also, besides sharing the four unities necessary to create a joint tenancy with right of survivorship time, title, interest, and possession there must also be the fifth unity of marriage. However, unlike a JTWROS, neither party in a <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entirety has a unilateral right to sever the tenancy. The termination of the tenancy or any dealing with {{any part of the}} property requires the consent of both spouses. A divorce breaks the unity of marriage, leaving the default tenancy, which may be a tenancy in common in equal shares. Many US jurisdictions no longer recognize <b>tenancies</b> <b>by</b> the entirety. [...] Where it is recognized, benefits can include the ability to shield the property from creditors of only one spouse, as well as the ability to partially shield the property where only one spouse is filing a petition for bankruptcy relief. If a non-debtor spouse in a <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entirety survives a debtor spouse, the lien can never be enforced against the property. On the other hand, if a debtor spouse survives a non-debtor spouse, the lien may be enforced against the whole property, not merely the debtor spouse's original half-interest.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the Entirety (United States): [...] "TBE" [...] is a {{separate}} property system in which spouses are treated as one person, each having an equal ownership {{interest in the subject}} property.

40|$|What is {{the effect}} of a city {{ordinance}} which proposes to a public utility company the terms on which it may dispose of its product to the users, but which is rejected by the company? As to a company not yet doing business {{it is clear that the}} ordinance when rejected becomes a mere legal nullity. It never was more than an offer that might ripen into a binding contract by acceptance. That it is by no means a nullity as to a utility actually operating in the city after the expiration of its franchise and as a mere tenant <b>by</b> <b>sufferance</b> of the streets, is held in City and County of Denver v. Denver Union Water Co. Supreme Court of the U. S. Nos. 294 and 295, decided March 4, 1918. The city of Denver may well be surprised to learn that by passing an ordinance which the company rejected it was considerably worse off than if it had done nothing. In effect, by passing an ordinance fixing the maximum charges permitted to be made by the company 2 ̆ 2 during the time it shall further act as a water carrier and tenant <b>by</b> <b>sufferance</b> of said streets 2 ̆ 2, the city gave to the plant a value that made the rates illegal and defeated the ordinance. That any unaccepted ordinance should have such an effect is indeed startling, the more so that in this case the city was careful to expressly recite in the preamble that the company had for four years been without a franchise and a mere tenant <b>by</b> <b>sufferance</b> of the streets and that this enactment was made without recognizing the right of the company to occupy the streets or to continue its service...|$|R

40|$|The law {{fails to}} {{accommodate}} the inconvenient fact that an individual’s identifiable genetic information is involuntarily and immutably shared with her close genetic relatives. Legal institutions have established that individuals have a cognizable interest in controlling genetic information that is identifying to them. The Supreme Court recognized in Maryland v. King that the Fourth Amendment is implicated when arrestees’ DNA is analyzed, and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act protects individuals from genetic discrimination in the employment and health-insurance markets. But genetic information is not like other forms of private or personal information because it is shared — immutably and involuntarily — {{in ways that are}} identifying of both the source and that person’s close genetic relatives. Standard approaches to addressing interests in genetic information have largely failed to recognize this characteristic, treating such information as individualistic. While many legal frames may be brought to bear on this problem, this Article focuses on the law of property. Specifically, looking to the law of <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entirety, this Article proposes one possible framework for grappling with the overlapping interests implicated in genetic identification and analysis. <b>Tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entirety, like interests in shared identifiable genetic information, calls for the difficult task of conceptualizing two persons as one. The law of <b>tenancy</b> <b>by</b> the entirety thus provides a useful analytical framework for considering how legal institutions might take interests in shared identifiable genetic information into account. This Article examines how this framework may shape policy approaches in three domains: forensic identification, genetic research, and personal genetic testing. In some of these domains, experts are already advocating for policies consistent with this framework...|$|R
