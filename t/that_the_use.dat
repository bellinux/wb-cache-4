5|$|According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{the total}} number of animals used in the US during 2015 was 820,812, down from almost 1.2 million in 2005, however, this number does not include rats and mice, which make up around 90% of {{research}} animals. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.|$|E

A 2010 meta-analysis found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (apart from aspirin), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and other studies in the early 1970s, the current consensus is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E

5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} is rare, with {{an estimated}} 3-4 cases per million annual incidence in adults.

A 1995 report from Saudi Arabia found a doubled incidence at 7 cases per 100,000; this was attributed to the fact that Behçet's disease, which increases risk of CVST, is more common in the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|Dickens wrote A Christmas Carol {{because of}} how British social policy treated {{children}} at the time, and wished to use the novella {{as a means to}} put forward his arguments against it. The story shows Scrooge as a paradigm for self-interest, and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor, especially children in poverty—personified by the allegorical figures of Want and Ignorance. The two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers—as was Tiny Tim. Douglas-Fairhurst observes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of such figures allowed Dickens to present his message of the need for charity, without alienating his largely middle-class readership.|$|E

Many threatened to mutiny if not discharged. On October 13, 1794, Wayne finally ordered them home.

30|$|Several studies {{reported}} that irrigation of agricultural lands with wastewater {{has caused a}} substantial accumulation of heavy metals in soils compared to background values and control soils.

The application of a Nano form of these substrates such as Nano-zeolite might remarkably increase their cation exchange capacity and surface area, however, pH and reducing conditions can influence distribution of soluble metals and they should be assessed in future works.|$|R
5|$|Greenlandic is an ergative language. This means that, {{instead of}} {{treating}} the grammatical relations {{as in most}} European languages where grammatical subjects are marked with nominative case and objects with accusative, the grammatical roles are defined differently.

Research into Greenlandic as used by the younger generation has shown <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of ergative alignment in Kalaallisut may be becoming obsolete, converting the language into a nominative–accusative language.|$|E

The character is dressed in red and is called 'Saruman' and 'Aruman' at different points. Smith and Matthews suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> of 'Aruman' was intended to avoid confusion with 'Sauron'. The 1980 Rankin/Bass TV animated version of The Return of the King begins roughly where Bakshi's film ends but does not include Saruman's character.|$|E
