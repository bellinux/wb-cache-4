5|$|KRS-One {{considered}} Run-D.M.C. {{the epitome}} of rap music in 1984 and had begun to rap following their lead. But he has also said that BDP's approach reflected {{a feeling that the}} early innovators like Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J were by 1986 tainted by commercial success and out of <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> streets.|$|E

5|$|The Yankees {{finished}} 79–75 in 1959, {{in third}} place, their worst record since 1925, as the White Sox, managed by Lopez, won the pennant. There was considerable criticism of Stengel, who {{was viewed as}} too old and out of <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> players.|$|E
5|$|During the 1848 revolution, San Martin left Paris {{and moved}} to Boulogne-sur-Mer, a small city in {{northern}} France.

Shortly after receiving {{the news of the}} Argentine victory against the Anglo-French blockade, he died, three o'clock on 17 August 1850.|$|E
5|$|The {{supposed}} refusals {{from these}} first three artists to participate {{was seen as}} evidence of self-censorship {{out of fear of}} violence from Islamists, which led to much debate in Denmark. The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that they asked Bluitgen to put them in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> artists, so the claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved. The author refused, and nobody has ever been able to confirm whether the incident is properly described.|$|E

5|$|Brad and Tracy Stevens are {{involved}} with the American Cancer Society's Coaches Vs. Cancer. Brad says that the cause really hit home for them after Tracy's mother died of the disease in June 2004. The day before Butler's 2010 Final Four appearance, they hosted a fundraiser for the organization. Brad Stevens has also volunteered his time to the Jukes Foundation for Kids, a charity benefiting Ugandan children run by former Butler player Avery Jukes. Stevens remains in close <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Butler basketball family; he notably took a one-game leave from the Celtics in January 2016 to visit with Andrew Smith, a player on both of Butler's Final Four teams who was dying of cancer; Smith died {{less than a week}} later. At the request of Andrew's widow, Sam, Brad delivered the eulogy at the memorial service on January 17, 2016.|$|E
5|$|During the night, the Asia Corps lost <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> 16th and 19th Divisions, but {{following}} the direct orders of Liman von Sanders, these divisions withdrew {{to the west}} of Nablus. Here von Oppen got in contact with them during the morning of 21 September. At that time the remains of the 702nd and 703rd Battalions were reformed into one battalion, supported by a rifle company, a machine gun company and a trench mortar detachment. The 701st Battalion with its machine gun company of six guns, a troop of cavalry, an infantry-artillery platoon with two mountain guns or howitzers and a trench mortar section with four mortars and a cavalry squadron, remained intact.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Mau {{attempted}} to verify his navigational {{knowledge of the}} wider Pacific by working as a seaman on an inter-island ship run by the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. From 1969 to 1973, Mau became friends with Mike McCoy, a Peace Corps volunteer stationed on Satawal. As well as marrying Mau's niece, McCoy sailed with Mau and they worked together on a project tagging turtles. McCoy became interested in Satawalese navigation, published several articles on the topic and kept in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> anthropologist Ben Finney, who was researching Polynesian navigation. When McCoy's assignment on Satawal ended, he asked Pialug {{if he wanted to}} come to Hawaii with him.|$|E

5|$|Many Welsh {{painters}} gravitated {{towards the}} art capitals of Europe. Augustus John {{and his sister}} Gwen John lived mostly in London and Paris. However, the landscapists Sir Kyffin Williams and Peter Prendergast lived in Wales {{for most of their}} lives, while remaining in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> wider art world. Ceri Richards was very engaged in the Welsh art scene as a teacher in Cardiff and even after moving to London. He was a figurative painter in international styles including Surrealism. Various artists have moved to Wales, including Eric Gill, the London-Welshman David Jones and the sculptor Jonah Jones. The Kardomah Gang was an intellectual circle centred on the poet Dylan Thomas and poet and artist Vernon Watkins in Swansea, which also included the painter Alfred Janes.|$|E
5|$|McGovern did not mourn {{leaving the}} Senate. Although being {{rejected}} {{by his own}} state stung, intellectually he could accept that South Dakotans wanted a more conservative representative; he and Eleanor felt out of <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> country {{and in some ways}} liberated by the loss. Nevertheless, he refused to believe that American liberalism was dead in the time of Reagan; remaining active in politics, in January 1981 he founded the political organization Americans for Common Sense. The group sought to rally liberals, encourage liberal thinking, and combat the Moral Majority and other new Christian right forces. In 1982, he turned the group into a political action committee, which raised $1.2 million for liberal candidates in the 1982 U.S. Congressional elections. McGovern shut the committee down when he decided to run for president again.|$|E
5|$|Potter {{had become}} tired of writing for {{children}} and increasingly unfamiliar with them. The Moore children (for whom she had written several tales early in her career) were grown, and Potter had not replaced them with other children, although she continued to write letters to child fans who had written her. She was out of <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> interests of American children. Her marriage to William Heelis on October 15, 1913 effectively ended her literary and artistic career. Although she published sporadically {{in the years following}} her marriage, her works depended principally upon decades-old concepts filed away in her publisher's offices and ageing illustrations tucked away in her portfolio. Only The Tale of Johnny Town-Mouse (1918) brought forth a completely new set of illustrations from the artist. She devoted herself to marriage and farming, and avoided publicity and fans.|$|E

5|$|Responsibility {{for running}} the {{university}} is held at an executive level by the vice-chancellor, but the council is the only body that can recommend changes to the university's statutes and charter, {{with the exception of}} academic ordinances. These can only be made with the consent of the senate, the chief academic body in the university which also holds responsibility for teaching and learning, examinations and research and enterprise. The chancellor and pro chancellors are nominated by council and appointed formally by court, whose additional powers are now limited to these appointments and a few others, including some lay members of council. Finally, Convocation, the body of all staff, ceremonial officers and graduates of the university, returns 100 members to court and one member to council, but is otherwise principally a forum for discussion and to ensure graduates stay in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> university.|$|E
5|$|Some experts {{argue that}} exposing {{children}} to television {{at such an}} early age is taking technology too far or that parents are using BabyFirst as a digital babysitter. Parents in-turn refute that argument, claiming that experts have lost <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> realities of raising a child. BabyFirst suggests the programming {{is intended to be}} watched by parents and their children together in an interactive way. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against exposing {{children under the age of}} two to television, while a 2003 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that most children under two years of age are already watching TV. According to The Washington Post, very little is known about whether young children watching television has a negative or positive effect on them.|$|E
5|$|The Czech revolutionary {{network in}} Europe {{also had a}} role in the {{uncovering}} of Bagha Jatin's plans. The network was in <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> members in the United States, and may have also been aware of and involved in the uncovering of the earlier plots. The American network, headed by E. V. Voska, was a counter-espionage network of nearly 80 members who, as Habsburg subjects, were presumed to be German supporters but were involved in spying on German and Austrian diplomats. Voska had begun working with Guy Gaunt, who headed Courtenay Bennett's intelligence network, at the outbreak of the war and on learning of the plot from the Czech European network, passed on the information to Gaunt and to Tomáš Masaryk who further passed on the information the American authorities.|$|E
