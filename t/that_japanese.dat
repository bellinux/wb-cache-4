5|$|A {{recurring}} {{horror story}} on many websites and popular media outlets is <b>that</b> <b>Japanese</b> soldiers during World War II inflicted bamboo torture upon prisoners of war. The victim was supposedly tied securely in place above a young bamboo shoot. Over several days, the sharp, fast growing shoot would first puncture, then completely penetrate the victim's body, eventually emerging {{through the other}} side. Possibility of this method was tested on an episode of MythBusters, and confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Kitayama and Karasawa {{concluded}} <b>that</b> <b>Japanese</b> {{people do}} indeed have warm feelings towards themselves, just like Americans and Europeans, but that these feelings are masked when explicitly asked for.

5|$|The {{campaign}} that Australian planners developed entailed three separate drives: in the north, it was planned <b>that</b> <b>Japanese</b> forces {{would be forced}} into the narrow Bonis Peninsula and contained; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east–west avenues of approach, as well as affording them protection against further counter-attacks, while also opening {{the way for a}} drive to the east coast; and the main campaign in the south, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated around Buin.|$|E

5|$|After news of {{the atomic}} bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki reached the Indies in early August 1945, {{followed}} by the proclamation of Indonesian independence on 17 August, it was evident <b>that</b> <b>Japanese</b> control was weakening. Sudirman led a break out from the camp in Bogor. Although his fellow internees wanted to attack the Japanese soldiers, Sudirman convinced them against it. After ordering the others to their hometowns, Sudirman {{made his way to}} Jakarta and met with President Sukarno, who asked him to lead resistance against Japanese forces in the city. Unfamiliar with Jakarta, Sudirman refused, instead offering to lead forces in Kroya. He left for his former command on 19August 1945. At the same time, Allied forces {{were in the process of}} retaking the Indonesian archipelago for the Netherlands. The first British forces arrived on 8September 1945.|$|E

5|$|In the South West Pacific, a {{conventional}} strategic bombing campaign {{was out of}} the question, as industrial targets in Japan were well beyond the range of even the largest strategic bombers operating from bases in Australia and New Guinea. Therefore, the primary mission of the Allied bomber force was interdiction of Japanese supply lines, especially the sea lanes. The results of the effort against the Japanese convoy in January were very disappointing; some 416 sorties had been flown with only two ships sunk and three damaged, so clearly, a change of tactics was in order. Group Captain Bill Garing, an RAAF officer on Kenney’s staff with considerable experience in air-sea operations, including a tour of duty in Europe, recommended <b>that</b> <b>Japanese</b> convoys be subjected to simultaneous attack from different altitudes and directions.|$|E

To investigate further, on August 19, a Marine patrol of 60 men and four native scouts, commanded by U.S. Marine Captain Charles H. Brush, marched east from the Lunga Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Second, it {{was then}} that Japan {{underwent}} a period of intense Westernization in order to compete with other developed countries. Initially architects and styles from abroad were imported to Japan but gradually the country taught its own architects and began to express its own style. Architects returning from study with western architects introduced the International Style of modernism into Japan. However, it was not until after the Second World War <b>that</b> <b>Japanese</b> architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like Kenzo Tange and then with theoretical movements like Metabolism.|$|E

5000|$|Scott Esposito of the Los Angeles Times {{said that}} the book [...] "offers {{evidence}} <b>that</b> the <b>Japanese</b> master has regained his footing."

5|$|Taiko {{performance}} is generally taught orally and through demonstration. Historically, general patterns for taiko were written down, {{such as in}} the 1512 encyclopedia called the Taigensho, but written scores for taiko pieces are generally unavailable. One reason for the adherence to an oral tradition is that, from group to group, the rhythmic patterns in a given piece are often performed differently. Furthermore, ethnomusicologist WilliamP. Malm observed <b>that</b> <b>Japanese</b> players within a group could not usefully predict one another using written notation, and instead did so through listening. In Japan, printed parts are not used during lessons.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} subsequently {{developed into}} three separate drives by the Australians, who fanned {{out from the}} main Allied base at Torokina: in the north, centre and southern parts of the island. The first actions were fought around the seizure of Pearl Ridge in late December 1944 to secure control of the east–west avenues of approach across the island, and to prevent any possible Japanese counter-attacks against Torokina. This was followed by actions in the north, where it was planned <b>that</b> <b>Japanese</b> forces would be forced into the narrow Bonis Peninsula and contained, while the main drive {{took place in the}} south, where the main Japanese forces were concentrated, with an initial drive towards Mosigetta, followed by an advance towards Buin on the coast. The drive south subsequently resulted in several actions around Slater's Knoll and around the Hongorai River.|$|E
5|$|The next raid on Singapore {{took place}} in January 1945. Following reports <b>that</b> <b>Japanese</b> {{warships}} damaged during the Philippines Campaign were being repaired at Singapore, a force of 47 Superfortresses was dispatched from India to attack the AdmiraltyIX Floating Dock {{as well as the}} King's Dock on the island's south coast. These aircraft took off at about midnight on 10January and began to arrive over Singapore at 08:20 on 11January. Only 27 of the attackers struck the docks, and due to heavy anti-aircraft fire from Japanese warships in the Straits of Johor the bombers did not cause any damage. The other aircraft bombed Penang in Malaya, Mergui in Burma and several targets of opportunity, generally without success. Two B-29s were lost during this operation.|$|E

5|$|The {{object of}} the sortie was to attack Japanese {{transports}} at Kota Bharu, but in the afternoon of 9 December the Japanese submarine I-56 spotted the British ships, and in the evening they were detected by Japanese aerial reconnaissance. By this time it had been made clear that no RAF fighter support would be forthcoming. At midnight a signal was received <b>that</b> <b>Japanese</b> forces were landing at Kuantan in Malaya. Force Z was diverted to investigate. At 02:11 on 10 December the force was again sighted by a Japanese submarine and at 08:00 arrived off Kuantan, {{only to discover that}} the reported landings were a diversion.|$|E
5|$|In November–December 1944, the Australian II Corps—consisting of Militia {{troops from}} the 3rd Division and the 11th Brigade—under Lieutenant General Stanley Savige took over {{responsibility}} for Allied operations on Bougainville from the American XIV Corps {{as part of a}} plan to free up the US troops for the fighting in the Philippines. Mistakenly believing that the Japanese forces on the island numbered just 17,500 men it was decided that the Australians should pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the Japanese from Bougainville. After taking over the US perimeter that had been established around Torokina, the Australian campaign developed into three separate drives: in the north, it was planned <b>that</b> <b>Japanese</b> forces would be forced into the narrow Bonis Peninsula and contained; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east–west avenues of approach, as well as affording them protection against further counter-attacks, while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast; and the main campaign in the south, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated. Allied estimates of Japanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after the war {{it was found that the}} number of Japanese alive on the island at this time was closer to 40,000.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August, seven {{landing craft}} {{carrying}} 353 Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces {{troops of the}} 5th Sasebo Special Naval Landing Force, supplemented by a few engineers of the 14th and 15th Pioneer Units (Setsueitai), set out from Cape Nelson in the dark {{to participate in the}} attack on the Allied forces at Milne Bay. Upon reaching Goodenough Island they were unable to locate a suitable hiding place during the day for their landing craft, which had to be left on the beach, where the Allies discovered them. A coastwatcher at Cape Nelson reported the Japanese movements, and Milne Bay received a report around midday on 25 August <b>that</b> <b>Japanese</b> were on the west coast of Goodenough Island. Nine Kittyhawks from No. 75 Squadron RAAF were despatched to investigate. They located the landing craft and destroyed all seven, along with the Japanese force's radio and most of its stores. The air raid killed eight Japanese; the survivors, lacking transport, were stranded. Meanwhile, the American detachment on Goodenough Island destroyed its own radios and withdrew from the island.|$|E

5|$|The main Japanese air {{offensive}} against the Mariana Islands began in early November 1944. On November1, a B-29 flying from the Marianas overflew the Tokyo region {{for the first}} time. The next day, nine or ten IJN G4Ms belonging to the IJN Attack Hikōtai 703 struck Isley Field and the adjacent Kobler Field on Saipan. The raiders arrived over Saipan shortly after 1:30am and dropped their bombs from low altitude. Only five bombs struck Isley Field, and these caused little damage. A Black Widow from the 6th Night Fighter Squadron shot {{down one of the}} G4Ms and another two were lost to other causes. On November3 the Imperial General Headquarters issued a statement which falsely claimed <b>that</b> <b>Japanese</b> aircraft had bombed and destroyed fifteen locations in Saipan and Tinian. A further attack by either five or ten G4Ms with fighter escorts took place at 1:30am on November7, but also caused little damage. The USAAF official history states that three G4Ms were downed in this raid while another source states there were no Japanese losses. Imperial General Headquarters claimed that 20 B-29s out of 40 located were destroyed in the November7 raid. These and all subsequent Japanese air attacks on the Marianas were overseen by the Air Training Army.|$|E
