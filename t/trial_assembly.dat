5000|$|The {{proposal}} was approved {{and the site}} was purchased {{with some of the}} profits from the Exhibition. Once the remaining funds had been raised, in April 1867 Queen Victoria signed the Royal Charter of the Corporation of the Hall of Arts and Sciences which was to operate the Hall and on 20 May, laid the foundation stone.The Hall was designed by civil engineers Captain Francis Fowke and Major-General Henry Y. D. Scott of the Royal Engineers and built by Lucas Brothers. [...] The designers were heavily influenced by ancient amphitheatres, but had also been exposed to the ideas of Gottfried Semper while he was working at the South Kensington Museum. The recently opened Cirque d'Hiver in Paris was seen in the contemporary press as the design to outdo. The Hall was constructed mainly of Fareham Red brick, with terra cotta block decoration made by Gibbs and Canning Limited of Tamworth. The dome (designed by Rowland Mason Ordish) on top was made of wrought iron and glazed. There was a <b>trial</b> <b>assembly</b> made of the iron framework of the dome in Manchester, then it was taken apart again and transported to London via horse and cart. When the time came for the supporting structure to be removed from the dome after reassembly in situ, only volunteers remained on site in case the structure dropped. It did drop - but only by five-sixteenths of an inch. The Hall was scheduled to be completed by Christmas Day 1870 and the Queen visited a few weeks beforehand to inspect.|$|E

40|$|Assembly process {{engineering}} {{is one of}} the biggest challenges in modern preproduction engineering. The quality of the process largely depends on the sequence of machine or device assembly. With increasing number of parts in the engineering system the number of allowable assembly sequences is rapidly increasing. It is impossible to analyse this copious combinatorial space without using the cutting-edge methods of mathematical modelling. The paper offers the algebraic models that can be used to select the rational design solutions at the preproduction engineering stage of the assembly operation. When assembling any engineering system the coherence and sequence conditions should be met. It is shown that an adequate mathematical description of sequential and coherent assembly operation is shrinkage of edges of the hyper-graph, which describes a mechanical structure of the product. For the product and its parts must be provided a property of the independent assembly. It is shown that this property can be represented as an action of the closure operator on a set of the product parts. The representations of this operator are parts to be assembled independently (the s-sets). Arranged by inclusion, an aggregate of all the sets is a lattice. The lattice is an algebraic structure where are specified two stable operations, namely: lattice intersection and lattice jog. It turned out that it is possible to use this structure, as a universal generating medium to a diversity of design options for the assembly conversion. The lattice terms are used to describe the sequences of product assembly and disassembly, the sequences of assembly and disassembly of the assembly units, the multi-level diagrams of the assembly decomposition, etc. The properties of the independent assembly are required not only to provide the assembly. A lot of design and technology operations can be performed, provided that a set of the parts has a stable and coordinated configuration within the product, i. e. an s-set of the lattice. For example, those are adjustment operation, various types of tests, fitting and <b>trial</b> <b>assembly,</b> etc. One of the most important operations when designing the engineering system is the synthesis of a rational system of design dimension chains. It is shown that the lattice operations can be used to find the minimum length design chains. The lattice structure allows us to state and solve a problem of minimizing the number of tests for geometric solvability (geometric access) while assembling the products of complicated Science & Education of the Bauman MSTU 231 configuration. It is shown that the set of all solvable configurations is the sub-lattice within the lattice of all the assembled configurations. This allows us to solve the problem of minimizing the number of geometrical tests through the algebraic lattice restoration methods...|$|E

At the third aviation salon in Paris 1911, Coandă displayed a scale model of the aircraft which used two Gnome rotary engines mounted back to back, connected by a bevel gear to a single two-bladed propeller. The combination of two engines connected to one propeller was originally intended to drive a new turbine, but Coandă was unable to fund one.

40|$|In {{order to}} develop {{realistic}} and robust maritime evacuation procedures, {{it is vital to}} understand how passengers behave in emergency situations. An essential component of this understanding is the collection and characterization of human performance data. However, little data relating to passenger response time or fullscale validation data in maritime environments exists. Although the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO) evacuation protocol Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) Circ. 1033 and its successor, MSC Circ. 1238, are of great use, it is known in the industry that the existing data is not representative of passenger ships in general. The SAFEGUARD project addresses the IMO Fire Protection Sub Committee’s requirement to collect full-scale data for calibration and validation of ship-based evacuation models, as well as proposing and investigating additional benchmark scenarios to be used in certification analysis. Funded through the European Commission’s 7 th Framework Programme, the Newfoundland and Labrador Research and Development Corporation and Transport Canada (Marine Safety), SAFEGUARD has brought together leading industry experts and the project findings will play an integral role in framing the next iteration of international guidelines for ship evacuation analysis.
