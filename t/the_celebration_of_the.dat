5|$|All the {{criminal}} proceedings against him were canceled and {{the charges of}} blasphemy were officially withdrawn. Alcibiades was able to assert his piety and to raise Athenian morale by leading the solemn procession to Eleusis (for <b>the</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eleusinian Mysteries) by land {{for the first time}} since the Spartans had occupied Decelea. The procession had been replaced by a journey by sea, but this year Alcibiades used a detachment of soldiers to escort the traditional procession. His property was restored and the ecclesia elected him supreme commander of land and sea (strategos autokrator).|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1524, Bucer {{concentrated}} on the main issue dividing leading reformers, the eucharist. In this dispute, he attempted to mediate between Martin Luther and Huldrych Zwingli. The two theologians disagreed on whether the body and blood of Christ were physically present within the elements of bread and wine during <b>the</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord's Supper. Luther believed in a corporeal or physical real presence of Christ; and Zwingli believed Christ's body and blood where made present by the Holy Spirit. By late 1524, Bucer had abandoned the idea of corporeal real presence and, after some exegetical studies, accepted Zwingli's interpretation. However, {{he did not believe}} the Reformation depended on either position but on faith in Christ, other matters being secondary. In this respect he differed from Zwingli.|$|E

5|$|Cẩn's {{influence}} {{began to}} wane after his elder brother Ngô Đình Thục was appointed the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế. Thục overshadowed Cẩn and aggressively promoted Catholicism, {{which led to}} the banning of the Buddhist flag in 1963 during Vesak, <b>the</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> birthday of Gautama Buddha. Cẩn's forces opened fire on a crowd who were protesting the ban, killing nine and precipitating the Buddhist crisis. Ongoing demonstrations intensified throughout the summer as the regime responded with increased brutality, sparking the toppling of the Diem regime in a November 1963 coup. Cẩn had been offered asylum by the US Department of State, but ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. had CIA agent Lucien Conein arrest the fallen Ngô in Saigon. Cẩn was turned over to the military junta, which tried and executed him in 1964.|$|E
5|$|In 1606 Vincenzo's heir Francesco {{commissioned}} from Monteverdi {{the opera}} L'Orfeo, to a libretto by Alessandro Striggio, for the Carnival season of 1607. It was given two performances in February and March 1607; the singers included, {{in the title}} role, Rasi, who had sung in the first performance of Euridice witnessed by Vincenzo in 1600. This was followed in 1608 by the opera L'Arianna (libretto by Ottavio Rinuccini), intended for <b>the</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marriage of Francesco to Margherita of Savoy. All the music for this opera is lost apart from Ariadne's Lament, which became extremely popular. To this period also belongs the ballet entertainment Il ballo delle ingrate.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{a unique}} case among English medieval monasteries that almost nothing has survived of {{what must have been}} a number of books owned by the house as such or in the keeping of {{individual}} monks. These would include at least a small library with biblical texts, spiritual works and perhaps some books on practical subjects, bearing in mind that the management of the abbey plant would have been a considerable challenge. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liturgy for a large part of the day and night would necessitate texts for the different participants, who as monks were for the most part not spectators but active participants, some of them with particular roles.|$|E

5|$|The Day of Reconciliation is {{a public}} holiday in South Africa held {{annually}} on 16 December. The holiday came into effect in 1994 {{after the end of}} apartheid, with the intention of fostering reconciliation and national unity for the country. The date was chosen because it was significant to both Afrikaner and African cultures. The government chose a meaningful date for both ethnic groups because they recognize the need for racial harmony. <b>The</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Day of Reconciliation can take the form of remembering past history, recognizing veteran's contributions, marching and other festivities.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Ministerium {{remained}} a constituent {{church of the}} General Council from 18671918. In 1918, following <b>the</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 400th anniversary of the Reformation, the three Lutheran church bodies of Eastern America (The General Synod, the General SynodSouth, and the General Council) reunited to form the United Lutheran Church in America.

The ULCA would later join with other American Lutherans, in 1962 in the Lutheran Church in America, and in 1988 in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (which continues to be an active church body and is a direct descendant of the Pennsylvania Ministerium).|$|E

5|$|The biographer Eugen Segnitz {{noted in}} 1922 {{that the work}} of intense {{expression}} was singular in the sacred music of its period, with a convincing musical interpretation of the biblical text and its manifold shades of emotion. Paul Hindemith wrote a trimmed adaption which probably helped to keep the work in the repertory, and François Callebout wrote an organ version, making the work accessible for smaller choirs. It was first performed in Wiesbaden, where the composer studied, in 2003. <b>The</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reger Year 2016 led to several performances.|$|E
5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 55,722, Ajax {{took the lead in}} the third minute when Cees de Wolf scored. They {{extended}} their lead in the 17th minute courtesy of a Johan Cruyff goal. Two more goals scored by forward Klaas Nuninga meant Ajax had a 4–0 lead at half-time. Liverpool responded late in the game when defender Chris Lawler scored in the 89th minute; however, Ajax scored a minute later through Henk Groot to win the match 5–1. The spectators could not really see much of the match due to the fog's density and at times could only tell by <b>the</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> team when a goal was scored.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground floor}} of Manjakamiadana was divided into two vast rooms with {{furniture}} and decor that reflected European influence but with placement of objects respecting the norms of Malagasy cosmology. Following the reign of RadamaII, the building was no longer inhabited but instead was reserved for state occasions. The northernmost of these two rooms {{was the site of}} the signing of important trade treaties with British and American dignitaries. It was also opened annually for <b>the</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Fandroana (Royal Bath) ceremony. Following the imposition of French colonial rule, Manjakamiadana was transformed in 1897 into L'Ecole Le Myre de Vilers (Le Myre de Vilers School), a training centre for Malagasy civil servants employed by the French colonial regime. When the purpose of the building changed, the elevation of the main hall's floor was raised by building a platform on top of the original wooden floor.|$|E

5|$|In the Early Medieval era most {{evidence}} of religious practice comes from monks and is heavily biased towards monastic life. From {{this can be}} seen the daily cycle of prayers and <b>the</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mass. There was also the business of farming, fishing and in the islands, seal hunting. Literary life revolved around the contemplation of texts and the copying of manuscripts. Libraries were of great importance to monastic communities. The one at Iona may have been exceptional, but it demonstrates that the monks were part of the mainstream of European Christian culture. Less well recorded, but as significant, was the role of bishops and their clergy. Bishops dealt with the leaders of the tuath, ordained clergy and consecrated churches. They also had responsibilities for the poor, hungry, prisoners, widows and orphans. Priests carried out baptisms, masses and burials. They also prayed for the dead and offered sermons. They anointed the sick with oil, brought communion to the dying and administered penance to sinners. Early local churches were widespread, but since they were largely made of wood, like that excavated at Whithorn, the only evidence that survives for most is in place names that contain words for church, including cill, both, eccles and annat, but others are indicated by stone crosses and Christian burials. Beginning on the west coast and islands and spreading south and east, these were replaced with basic masonry-built buildings.|$|E
5|$|Just {{after the}} start of the second half of extra time Cardiff made their final substitution, {{replacing}} McNaughton with Darcy Blake. Two minutes later Kuyt made a run from deep in the Liverpool half, his initial shot was blocked, but the ball rebounded towards him. As the ball came back to him he shot again and the ball went past Heaton and into the Cardiff goal to give Liverpool a 2–1 lead. Cardiff were struggling after the goal with a number of their players suffering from cramp. Nevertheless, they had a chance in the 111th minute, when a Gunnarsson long throw was only half-cleared by Liverpool, but they were unable to convert the chance. Towards the end of the half Cardiff began to exert more pressure on Liverpool. Turner, who had been moved into the striker position won a corner for Cardiff, which was punched away by Reina for a throw-in. Cardiff won another from the throw, which found Kiss, whose shot was cleared off the line of the Liverpool goal by Kuyt for another corner. The subsequent corner was headed on by Gunnarsson to Turner, who beat Kuyt to the ball and put his shot past Reina into the Liverpool goal to level the score at 2–2. Turner was shown a yellow card for removing his shirt during <b>the</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goal. Liverpool won a corner with a minute remaining but they were unable to score and the referee brought extra time to an end with the scores level, resulting in a penalty shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|Next to {{the south}} {{entrance}} to the park is the Bärenzwinger (bear pit). This was built in 193839 {{on the site of}} a former sanitation depot, also designed by Ludwig Hoffmann and already decorated with more than 50 plaques by Otto Lessing depicting bears, and a public lavatory, and opened on 17 August 1939. It consists of indoor sleeping quarters and outdoor exercise areas which have held as many as five bears (the armorial animal of Berlin) who are the official bears or mascots of the city. The impetus for building the Bärenzwinger was a letter to the newspaper Berliner Zeitung am Mittag (now B.Z.) from Wilfried Bade which appeared the day after the end of <b>the</b> <b>celebration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city's 700-year anniversary, and the Lord Mayor, Julius Lippert, had it completed despite objections from some Nazi functionaries that there were more important things to be done in what proved to be the run-up to World War II. Two of the original bears were gifts from Bern, which also has a bear on its arms. It remains largely unchanged, although it had to be reconstructed after the war; it reopened in 1949 with two new bears, again from Bern; one of these, Jente, produced 33 cubs (including 4 sets of triplets and 9 pairs of twins) before being retired to the zoo. The last official city bear, Schnute, lived there until her death in 2015; her daughter Maxi also lived there until her death in August 2013. The Bärenzwinger is a listed Berlin landmark. It was threatened with closure in 1990 due to lack of funds for needed modernisation, but after public protest, the Berlin Senate undertook to pay for the project. Underfloor heating in the cages and a skylight dome were added, and the electricity supply was overhauled. The facility reopened in 1993 and celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2009. Some animal protection advocates, including the city's own animal protection officer, have called for it to be closed as oldfashioned and inhumane.|$|E
