5|$|Steiner {{differentiated}} offers, {{threats and}} throffers {{based on the}} preferability of compliance and noncompliance for the subject when compared to <b>the</b> <b>normal</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> events that would have come about were no intervention made. Steiner's account was criticised by philosopher Robert Stevens, who instead suggested that what was important in differentiating the kinds of intervention was whether performing or not performing the requested action {{was more or less}} preferable {{than it would have been}} were no intervention made. Throffers form part of the wider moral and political considerations of coercion, and form part of the question of the possibility of coercive offers. Contrary to received wisdom that only threats can be coercive, throffers lacking explicit threats have been cited as an example of coercive offers, while some writers argue that offers, threats and throffers may all be coercive if certain conditions are met. For others, by contrast, if a throffer is coercive, it is explicitly the threat aspect that makes it so, and not all throffers can be considered coercive.|$|E

40|$|Two {{developmental}} {{systems for}} leaves of Festuca pratensis were compared, namely development along the leaf (base to apex) {{and development of}} the whole leaf with time. The methods for examination of nucleic acids from leaves of F. pratensis were optimised and the changes occurring in rRNA fractions, tRNAs and polyribosomes during both developmental systems were recorded. These changes were related to changes in levels and syntheses of soluble and particulate proteins. Activities of enzymes intimately involved in these relationships, namely RNAses, ATPases, phosphatases, pyrophosphatases and phosphodiesterases were monitored during development. The metabolic status was further examined by the study of the polypeptide - synthesizing capacity of the ribosomes at different stages as revealed in wheatgerm- derived cell-free systems. Three phases of increased metabolism were apparent in both developmental systems but only the initial and final phases involved increased RNA synthesis which was correlated with increased protein synthetic capacity.

In addition, from any external constructive appraisal it is desirable to give synergism to the previous sequence {{in order to get}} not only a result but an efficient result. Then, we set forth three case studies in order to analyze the contribution of networking in planning to improve regional synergism. The first case is the design of a binary associative network with SMEs respondents over firm attribute dichotomies which renders the archetype pattern in the surveyed assembly. The second one deals with a horizontal network architecture, of n local SMEs which perform similar economic activity, in which different linkage strategies impose success or defeat to specific ensemble’s aim.
