40|$|Reviews of the {{evidence}} for magnetization of the moon found from discovery of remanence in lunar samples, direct measurements of fields {{on the surface of}} the moon, and direct and indirect determination of fields from lunar orbit. It is shown that {{the evidence}} implies that the fields are not only local but that regional properties are found though there is still no direct evidence for a global dipole moment. Limits on the detectibility of a global dipole are given and it is shown that the strength of magnetization for reasonable thermal gradients places possible dipole moments just below the <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>detectibility</b> of current experiments. The hypothesis of plate magnetics is reviewed. Current ideas regarding the source of the background magnetic field presumed responsible for the magnetization are critically considered. These are the dynamo hypothesis and primordial magnetization. Consequences of both are discussed and finally the constraints placed upon the thermal evolution of the moon are considered...|$|E

40|$|Complex {{singularity}} exponent {{is a local}} invariant of a holomorphic function {{defined by}} the square-integrability of fractional powers of the function. Log canonical <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> effective Q-divisors on normal algebraic varieties are algebraic counterparts of complex singularity exponents. For a Fano variety, these invariants have global analogues. In the former case, it is so-called α-invariant of Tian. In the latter case, it is a global log canonical <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> the Fano variety, which is the infimum <b>of</b> log canonical <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> all effective Q-divisors numerically equivalent to the anticanonical divisor. The appendix to this paper contains the proof that the global log canonical <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> a smooth Fano variety coincides with its α-invariant. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to compute global log canonical <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> smooth Fano threefolds (altogether there are 105 deformation families if such threefolds).

40|$|So far, {{only the}} energy <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> single {{discrete}} breathers in nonlinear Hamiltonian {{systems have been}} analytically obtained. In this work, the energy <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> discrete breathers in thermal equilibrium and the energy <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> long-lived discrete breathers which can remain after a long time relaxation are analytically estimated for nonlinear chains. These energy thresholds are size dependent. The energy <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> discrete breathers in thermal equilibrium are same as the previous analytical results for single discrete breathers. The energy <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> long-lived discrete breathers in relaxation processes {{are different from the}} previous results for single discrete breathers but agree well with the published numerical results known to us. Because real systems are either in thermal equilibrium or in relaxation processes, the obtained results could be important for experimental detection of discrete breathers.
