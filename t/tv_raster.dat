40|$|The {{principles}} of spectral analysis of images in Radon space were studied and developed and the fast-acting hybrid optical-digital Radon-Fourier-processor for spectral analysis of images was created. The calculation algorithm of Fourier transformation in Radon space was developed, the equations connecting one-dimensional conversion of image Hartly-projection with {{a section of}} frequency plane of the two-dimensional Hartly transformation of the analyzed image were obtained. The <b>TV</b> <b>raster</b> rotation system was first developed and used. It {{makes it possible to}} perform spectral analysis of images in TV rate. The <b>TV</b> <b>raster</b> rotation system for pattern recognition was introduced in several InstitutesAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a novel approach}} {{to the problem of}} generating dynamic <b>TV</b> <b>raster</b> displays for real-time simulation (such as for visual flight simulation). In particular, the most time consuming part of generating such displays, the hidden surface elimination, is performed using many identical custom VLSI processors. Each processor is assigned a surface and for each pixel, all processors compete to decide which object is visible. It is found that this approach leads to a practical system which is conceptually and practically simple, expandable, and reliable...|$|E
40|$|Two new {{techniques}} are presented {{for reducing the}} number of depth calculations in hidden surface elimination. Two new algorithms using the techniques are compared with three existing algorithms and it is shown by examples that the {{new techniques}} reduce the number of multiplications involved in the depth calculations. A technique for increasing the parallelism of operations is also presented. This allows the calculation to be done more rapidly in hardware and is particularly useful for generating line drawings rather than the usual <b>TV</b> <b>raster</b> scan images in the common raster-scan hidden surface algorithms...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1971 An {{experimental}} underwater {{acoustic imaging}} system has been designed and built. Operating at 650 KHz, real time acoustic images are obtainable. Using both geometrical optics and Fourier optics, the theory of image formation and resolution is presented. Other factors affecting image quality and system acuity are also discussed. System components include a 650 KHz lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) illuminating transducer, and 01. 4 Plexiglas acoustic converging lens, an 81 element mosaic PZT receiving transducer which is resonant at about 650 KHz, 81 amplifiers, a scanning and synchronizing system, and a display oscilloscope. Acoustic energy reflected by the target object is collected by the lens and focused onto the image receiving transducer, which {{is located in the}} image plane. The image, appearing as a spatial acoustic pressure distribution in the image plane, is sampled by the 81 element receiver, The 81 image element voltages are amplified and sequentially transmitted to the Z-axis input of an oscilloscope. Each channel amplifier is switched, in sequence, by solid state logic switches located in the scanning circuit. The scanning circuit drives the oscilloscope in a nine line <b>TV</b> type <b>raster</b> scan. If an image element is insonified, a bright spot corresponding to the image element is lighted on the oscilloscope display. The receiving system has a measured sensitivity threshold of 3 x 10 ⁻¹⁰ watts/cm² and a measured system resolution of approximately 2. 1 °. Real time images of simple styrofoam targets are displayed...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{examined the}} relative effects o f (I) image size and (2) number o f <b>TV</b> <b>raster</b> lines {{making up the}} image upon an observer‘s ability to identify 16 different geometric symbols on TV. Four raster-line values per symbol height were each tested at rhree image angular sub-tenses. Eight subjects were told to identify 25 symbols for each of rhe 12 conditions; all had 20112 near and far visual acuity or better. The forced-choice method was used; no limits were placed on response times. The results showed that (I) at least eight raster lines per symbol height and (2) a symbol subtense of 10 ’ of arc are necessary to obtain good symbol legibility on TV. An equation is developed from these and other data which quantifies the tradeoff between line number and angular subtense for different levels of performance...|$|E
40|$|Preliminary {{image quality}} {{measurements}} {{have been performed}} on a digital photoelectronic imaging system assembled in our laboratory. The system consists of a Gd 2 O 2 S:Tb fluorescent screen optically coupled to a microchannel plate (MCP) intensified CCD camera. The imaging system includes a motorized zoom lens, with a zoom range of about 5. 2, for changing the imaging field size from 12. 0 x 10. 7 mm to 63 x 56 mm 2. Video images are digitized by a real-time frame grabber integrated with a personal computer for image processing and analysis. The modulation transfer function of the system has been first determined for a 34 x 31 mm 2 field size obtaining a spatial resolution limit of about 4. 5 lp/mm and of 5 lp/mm in the direction parallel and perpendicular to the <b>TV</b> <b>raster</b> lines. MTF measurements for various zoom factor have been then carried out (only in the perpendicular direction). A spatial resolution limit of about 7. 5 lp/mm and 3. 5 lp/mm has been obtained for the maximum and the minimum optical zoom factor, respectively. Noise power spectrum analysis has shown that time-invariant noise sources can be removed by a digital background subtraction procedure...|$|E
