Our routing metric, <b>Path</b> Predicted <b>Transmission</b> Time (PPTT), {{is designed to}} choose a high-quality path for RTC flow between a source and a destination. PPTT can serve as both single-radio and multi-radio routing metric for RTC flow. Real Time Communications has critical quality of service (QoS) requirements in terms of delay, bandwidth and so on. Traditional measurement-based routing schemes ignore the interference from the coming RTC flow itself (i. e. self-traffic), so they may choose the inefficient path to serve the coming RTC flow due to the inaccurate quality estimation of the <b>transmission</b> <b>path.</b> PPTT takes explicit consideration of both self-traffic and neighboring traffic interfering with the RTC flow, and thus offers an accurate estimation of <b>path</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>delay.</b> Through differentiating the links by the wireless channel/radio they are using, PPTT has the capability to choose a high-quality path for the coming RTC flow in both single-radio and multi-radio networks.
