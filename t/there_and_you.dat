Leaving you country, in spite of its enormous magnitude, you are robbers that broke into our territory, plundering and killing us mercilessly. We have never thought of doing such things to you, but you have invaded our land, astonishing us with this murderous diabolical countenance, making us stubbornly resist, not for us to lose our independence and autonomy, trying to keep our golden will and freedom in our hands. We are not internally at war, and we will defend ourselves from you, the same way wild beasts defend themselves against attackers, and I will say to you strictly, that we are all to lay down with our bones, as its unanimous that we will rather die than surrendering our fotress to you voluntarily. You point Aslanduz to me out, where your „two-thousand large detachment“ supposedly defeated our „thirty-thousand large army“. Shame on you, General, to lie, you should speak the truth, without hiding the real facts of how it ended <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> shouldn't brag about that particular victory of you over us, which was thanks to the despicable betrayal of our troops. If you forgot about this outrageous event, I shall remind you, fueling anger and hostility towards Abbas Mirza for his strict handling his soldiers wanted to take revenge on him, by raising the white flag amongst 10,500 soldiers, and voluntarily gave themselves up, laid down their weapons and hoped to receive salvation from you; but instead, you disarmed them, without conscience and compassion, and watched how your soldiers killed then thousand of them, leaving alive only 500 people as a trophy of victory. Shame and disgrace. It is a worthy lesson as traitors are oath breakers, {{but at the same time}} a good warning for the rest of the treacherous soldiers, lest they be deceived and deceived by your cunning and false promises. And after these vile barbaric executions committed by you on innocent people who voluntarily handed down themselves to you, you dare to speak of love for man. I feel sorry for your brave soldiers serving as blind tools to achieve your robbers goals: but your boss will only reward you as the commander, with decorations, medals and even large sums of money for the heroic and courageous deed of your brave soldiers, whom it will bypass.|$|E
500|$|Gilliam {{used the}} same filmmaking style as he had in Brazil (1985), {{including}} the art direction and cinematography (specifically using fresnel lenses). The appearance of the interrogation room where Cole is being interviewed by the scientists {{was based on the}} work of Lebbeus Woods; these scenes were shot at three different power stations (two in Philadelphia and one in Baltimore). Gilliam intended to show Cole being interviewed through a multi-screen interrogation TV set because he felt the machinery evoked a [...] "nightmarish intervention of technology. You try to see the faces on the screens in front of you, but the real faces and voices are down <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have these tiny voices in your ear. To me that's the world we live in, the way we communicate these days, through technical devices that pretend to be about communication but may not be." ...|$|E
500|$|Some vocalising by Lennon is faintly audible {{at the end}} of the song, {{picked up}} as leakage onto one of the drum {{microphones}} (close listening shows Lennon making other comments to Starr). In the [...] "Paul is Dead" [...] hoax these were taken to be Lennon saying [...] "I buried Paul." [...] In 1974, McCartney said, [...] "That wasn't 'I buried Paul' at all – that was John saying 'cranberry sauce' … That's John's humour … If you don't realise that John's apt to say cranberry sauce when he feels like it, then you start to hear a funny little word <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> think, 'Aha!'" [...] Shortly before his death in 1980, Lennon expressed dissatisfaction with the final version of the song, saying it was [...] "badly recorded" [...] and accusing McCartney of subconsciously sabotaging the recording.|$|E

500|$|When {{people did}} confess to even a minor {{role in the}} rioting, such as {{throwing}} a few stones, they were charged with affray. One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting: [...] "You would go to bed and you would just lie <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> would think, {{are they going to}} come and kick my door, what's going to happen to my children?... It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by day, knowing they could come and kick down your door and hold you for hours." [...] The inquiry heard that 9,165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985. Thus, argues Rose, the police created, or at least intensified, a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid to step forward.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal only {{managed a}} draw against West Bromwich Albion on 20 November 2004; Robert Earnshaw's goal with 11 minutes {{remaining}} of normal time cancelled out Pirès’s opener. Arsenal lost their final match of November, away to Liverpool at Anfield. Vieira finished off a one-touch move to equalise for Arsenal – who were {{behind in the}} first half – but Neil Mellor scored the winning goal of the game, shooting from long range. Football pundit Alan Hansen in his analysis on Match of the Day criticised the temperament of Arsenal’s players and questioned their desire: [...] "When you have success, sometimes it isn't <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have to dig in with great determination and hard work, and at the moment they are not doing that. When you look at their two big players, Henry and Vieira, [...] must do better in future." [...] Arsenal ended the month in second, five points behind leaders Chelsea.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} Lizard {{merchandise}} designs along with unconfirmed concept art featuring a humanoid-shape {{with a layer}} of scales on top instead of a pronounced snout (similar to a dinosaur or crocodile) as in the most recent comics, produced a mixed reaction. Many commenters compared it to other fictional characters instead of his rendering in comics. Russ Fischer of /Film described the character as looking more [...] "Steve Ditko derived" [...] (the character's original artist). Webb felt that there are different incarnations of Lizard in the comic book. He felt that he should do it without the snout because he was interested more in human emotions and wanted to keep Rhys' presence in the creature. Webb wanted him to have emotion, have a face and have feeling. He stated [...] "that in a comic book, you just put that thing up <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> can say, oh, thought bubble, whatever. But when you try to do that and make it look real, it's a different challenge, and I'm creating a movie, I'm not creating a comic book. That was part of the design." ...|$|E

500|$|During production, Benson felt one {{recording}} {{session with}} Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf {{went beyond the}} ordinary {{to the point where}} he left the recording room and told Powell [...] "You have to go out <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> and her do this because you're coming to God right now in front of my eyes. You guys handle it". According to Benson, both he and Mosley were moved to tears by the session and Benson felt that something like that does not happen often in a recording studio. In a separate session with Mosley, bassist Tai Anderson said that, after recording the end of the song [...] "Run to You", Mosley said she could not believe she was recording with the band. Concerned that Mosley might have been pressured by her management team into doing the collaboration, Anderson said they told Mosley that she didn't have to do the recording. Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band's music had helped her during a difficult period in her teenage years.|$|E
500|$|Several bonus tracks follow on {{separate}} editions; some continue the teenage theme, {{while others are}} joke tracks. Barker used Afro-Cuban influences for his drum track on [...] "Don't Tell Me It's Over", and DeLonge used something other than his punk influences for [...] "What Went Wrong". [...] While DeLonge felt [...] "staple acoustic songs" [...] were big for groups at the time (such as Green Day's [...] "Good Riddance"), the band wrote all of their songs from their inception on acoustic guitars, and he felt he would rather have [...] "What Went Wrong" [...] in its original form. [...] "You grow up and realize, 'Fuck! Who gives a fuck about punk rock?'" [...] he said. [...] "There are so many great forms of music out <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> grow beyond wanting to listen to or write something because your parents will hate it." [...] Finn suggested lyrics for the song after viewing a documentary on the first Russian nuclear test; in the film, an aged Soviet physicist says of watching the explosion, [...] "There was a loud boom, and then the bomb began fiercely kicking at the world." ...|$|E

[...] However, he called the connection between Story Mode and Mob Wars [...] "tenuous and disjointed." [...] He concluded [...] "Mob Wars doesn't live up to its potential.

2500|$|Austin's rise {{to stardom}} {{began at the}} 1996 King of the Ring. He began using his {{trademark}} finishing maneuver, the Stone Cold Stunner; with this new technique, he won the King of the Ring tournament. After defeating Marc Mero in the semi-finals, Austin defeated Jake [...] "The Snake" [...] Roberts in the finals. The Stunner debuted on June 8, 1996 on Superstars when he defeated jobber Jason Arndt, who later became known as Joey Abs {{a member of the}} Mean Street Posse. At the time, Roberts was portraying a born-again Christian, so after the match, Austin cut a now famous promo during his coronation, telling Roberts, [...] "You sit <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> thump your Bible, and you say your prayers, and it didn't get you anywhere! Talk about your Psalms, talk about ... Austin 3:16 says I just whipped your ass!". Austin's win and rise to stardom proved to be an un-telegraphed stroke of luck.

[...] "Austin 3:16" [...] ultimately {{became one of the most}} popular catchphrases in wrestling history and subsequently the slogan became one of the best-selling T-shirts in WWE merchandise history.

2500|$|Springfield {{introduced}} the Motown sound {{to a wider}} UK audience, both with her covers of Motown songs, and by facilitating the first UK TV appearance for The Temptations, The Supremes, The Miracles, and Stevie Wonder on {{a special edition of}} the Ready Steady Go! show – which was produced by Wickham – called The Sound of Motown. On 28 April 1965 it was broadcast by Rediffusion TV, with Springfield opening each half of the show accompanied by Martha Reeves and the Vandellas and Motown's in-house band, The Funk Brothers. The associated Tamla-Motown Revue featuring The Supremes, The Miracles and Wonder had started in London in March, and according to The Supremes' Mary Wilson, the tour was a flop: [...] "It's always... disheartening when you go out <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> see the house is half-full... but once you're on stage... You perform as well for five as you do for 500." [...] Wickham, a fan of the Motown artists, booked them for the Ready Steady Go! special and enlisted Springfield to host it. In 1966 Springfield released three additional UK Top20 hits: [...] "Little By Little" [...] and two dramatic ballads – one written by Carole King: [...] "Goin' Back" [...] and [...] "All I See Is You," [...] written by Ben Weisman & Clive Westlake, which also reached the US Top20. In August and September 1966, she hosted Dusty, a six-part music and talk show weekly BBC TV series. A compilation of her singles, Golden Hits released in November 1966, reached No.2 in the UK. From the mid-1960s, Springfield would use the pseudonym [...] "Gladys Thong" [...] when recording backing vocals for other artists including Madeline Bell, Kiki Dee, Anne Murray and Elton John. Bell was a regular backing singer on early Springfield albums, and the pair co-wrote [...] "I'm Gonna Leave You" [...] with Lesley Duncan, which appeared as the B-side of [...] "Goin' Back." ...|$|E
