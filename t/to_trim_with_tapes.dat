Model 36, a {{hull form}} with {{parallel}} middle body {{for half the}} length of the forebody and designed particularly for use with stub wings, was tested according to the general fixed-trim method over the range of practical loads, trims, and speeds. It was also tested free <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>with</b> the center of gravity at two different positions. The results are given in the form of nondimensional coefficients. The resistance at the hump was exceptionally low but, at high planing speeds, afterbody interference made the performance only mediocre...|$|R

60|$|The {{town was}} at length reached; and the {{shopping}} was quite wonderful to the sisters. Miss Fosbrook found a shop where the marvellous woman undertook to send home two grey frocks <b>trimmed</b> <b>with</b> pink, {{by the next}} evening; and found two such fashionable black silk jackets, that Susie felt quite ashamed of herself, though rather pleased; and Bessie only wished {{she could see her}} own back, it must look so like Ida's. Then there were white sleeves, and white collars, that made them feel like young women; and little pink silk handkerchiefs for their necks; and two straw hats, which Miss Fosbrook undertook <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>with</b> puffs of white ribbon, and a pink rosette at each ear. Bessie thought they would be the most beautiful things that had ever been in her possession, and was only dreading that Sam would say they were like those on Ida Greville's donkey's best harness; while Susan looked quite frightened at them, whispered a hope that Mamma would not think them too fine, and that Miss Fosbrook would not let them cost too much money; and when assured that all fell within what Papa had given to be laid out, she begged that Annie and little Sally might have the like.|$|R

2500|$|In 1976, the North Koreans clashed {{again with}} the joint South Korean-United States forces in {{what is known as}} the axe murder incident. [...] Southern forces were pruning a tree near the DMZ. [...] The North Korean guards responded <b>to</b> the <b>trimming</b> <b>with</b> {{surprising}} hostility, sparking a violent brawl that culminated with the murder of two American soldiers, both of whom had been axed to death. Historically similar to this incident and the Pueblo incident, the North Korean retelling of events paints the United States and South Korean forces as the aggressors, and this incident almost led to a second Korean War.|$|R

5000|$|For {{a number}} of years, poultry {{processors}} have been permitted to either rinse (wash) off or cut (trim) away such contamination, but beef processors have only been permitted <b>to</b> (<b>trim)</b> it <b>with</b> a knife. This, they argue, costs them money in lost product weight and imposes a requirement that poultry producers {{do not have to}} meet. The policy jargon for this debate is [...] "wash versus trim". USDA, early in 1997, clarified its zero tolerance rule for poultry; a year earlier it gave beef plants permission to use a new high-temperature vacuuming method to remove fecal contamination in lieu of cutting it off.|$|R
5000|$|The {{level of}} the lake usually is lowered by 10 ft over the winter {{in an attempt to}} freeze weeds. Attempts have been made <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> them <b>with</b> {{mechanical}} cutters on barges; this has had limited success. Various chemical and biological methods have been considered, tested and/or employed to fight the weeds. In December 2006, the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, working with members of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency treated Candlewood Lake for its eelgrass and algae issues with an organic phosphate. Grass-eating weevils were tested in 2008 and 2010, and grass-eating carp were introduced in 2015.|$|R

25|$|Several {{kinds of}} case {{trimmers}} are available. Die-based trimmers {{have an open}} top, and allow the case <b>to</b> be <b>trimmed</b> <b>with</b> a file during the loading process.

Typically the device is cranked by hand, but sometimes they have attachments to allow the use of a drill or powered screwdriver. Powered case trimmers are also available. They usually consist of a motor (electric drills are sometimes used) and special dies or fittings that hold the case <b>to</b> be <b>trimmed</b> at the appropriate length, letting the motor do the work of trimming.|$|R

50|$|A curiosity in {{the largely}} single-seat entry list was Tim Birkin's blower Bentley touring car, {{stripped}} down <b>to</b> racing <b>trim,</b> <b>with</b> headlights and mudguards removed. The race distance was twenty five laps of the 15.8 km track, making {{a total of}} 396 km. Guy Bouriat took an early lead, followed by Williams, Zanelli, Czaikowski and Étancelin, with Birkin as first non-Bugatti driver, in sixth place. Williams in a works Bugatti then became the next leader. Czaikowski fell back through the field and Bouriat in the other works Bugatti made a pitstop giving over the car to Chiron. Then Williams also {{had to make a}} stop for a new wheel.

The bonnet is often made of black velvet and trimmed, between crown and brim, with gold cord and tassels.

40|$|This {{monograph}} {{presents the}} work on trimming procedure when researchers faced with data that appear to violate the t-test or ANOVA assumptions. It is intended as an accessible introduction on <b>trimming</b> which is <b>to</b> depart from <b>trimming</b> <b>with</b> fixed amount <b>to</b> automated <b>trimming.</b> The authors use simulation methods to identify the robustness of each procedure. Several variables were manipulated such as number of groups, balanced and unbalanced sample sizes, variance heterogeneity, pairing of group variances and group sample sizes, and types of distributions. This monograph illustrates new alternative procedures to researchers (in various fields, especially the experimental sciences) which will not be constrained with all the assumptions such as normality and homogeneity of variances. Rather, the researchers can work with the original data without {{having to worry about}} the shape of the distributions...|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} fighter configuration with a forward-swept wing of {{aspect ratio}} 3. 28 is {{tested in the}} Langley 7 by 10 Foot High Speed Tunnel at a Mach number of 0. 3. The wing has 29. 5 degrees of forward sweep of the quarter chord line and is equipped with 15 percent chord leading edge and 30 percent chord trailing edge flaps. The canard is sweptback 45 degrees. Tests were made through a range of angle of attack from about - 2 degrees to 22 degrees. Deflecting the flaps significantly improves the lift drag characteristics at the higher angles of attack. The canard is able <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> the configurations <b>with</b> different flap deflections {{over most of the}} range of angle of attack. The penalty in maximum lift coefficient due <b>to</b> <b>trimming</b> is about 0. 10...|$|R
