5|$|A major {{contributor}} to the sedimentation of the Little Applegate River is McDonald Ditch, an irrigation ditch near McDonald Creek. Built in 1920 to provide water to residents of nearby Wagner Creek, <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> has failed numerous times, sending several tons of dirt and mud downstream. The Talent Irrigation District approved purchasing a $10,000 monitoring system for <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> in September 2010, and applied for a $100,000 United States Bureau of Reclamation grant to replace <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> with pipes.|$|E
5|$|Antiquarians {{and historians}} have been {{interested}} in <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank to the north of <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests {{that the purpose of the}} earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> was probably a boundary marker.|$|E
5|$|Despite heavy weathering, <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> {{is still}} visible in short sections, {{which can be}} 45yards wide and up to 5feet deep. A 330-yard stretch through Denton Golf Course, and a section running through Platt Fields Park, are {{considered}} the best preserved remains. In 1997, a segment of <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> 150-yard long in Platt Fields was protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The rest of <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> remains unprotected.|$|E
5000|$|During archaeological {{excavation}} of the drainage channels, researchers found artefacts including wooden digging sticks, a grindstone, {{and other small}} items. <b>The</b> <b>ditches</b> were cleaned out, and a small trench was dug to study the different layers of clay used to construct <b>the</b> <b>ditches.</b> These different layers suggest that <b>the</b> <b>ditches</b> were deliberately constructed by people.|$|R
50|$|As of fall 893, Li Keyong's {{army had}} Li Cunxiao's capital Xing Prefecture under siege. Li Keyong had his {{soldiers}} dig ditches around Xing's walls, but Li Cunxiao disrupted the operation by frequently attacking the soldiers digging <b>the</b> <b>ditches.</b> <b>The</b> Hedong officer Yuan Fengtao (袁奉韜) then sent a secret message to Li Cunxiao, stating that Li Keyong {{would return to}} Hedong's capital Taiyuan as soon as <b>the</b> <b>ditches</b> were complete and that Li Cunxiao should let <b>the</b> <b>ditches</b> be finished, as {{none of the other}} Hedong officers could stand up to him. Li Cunxiao, agreeing with Yuan, held off on attacking the ditch-digging soldiers. Soon thereafter, <b>the</b> <b>ditches</b> were complete, but to Li Cunxiao's surprise, <b>the</b> <b>ditches</b> were done so well that no one could cross them, and they trapped Li Cunxiao inside the city without aid.|$|R
50|$|No {{artifacts}} {{were found}} in <b>the</b> <b>ditches</b> or in <b>the</b> area enclosed by <b>the</b> <b>ditches,</b> but maize pollen was found under soil that had been disturbed from digging <b>the</b> <b>ditches.</b> Radio-carbon dating indicates that all three circles were complete by 450 BCE. There {{is no evidence of}} the circles' being used for habitation, ceremonial or defense purposes. Sears holds that the maize pollen indicates that the circles were used for cultivation. <b>The</b> <b>ditches</b> around <b>the</b> circles penetrated the hardpan, helping to drain the prairie soil. Sears also states that the Great Circle likely was used for gardens from several centuries BCE until the end of period II, around 600 to 800. Sears compares <b>the</b> circular <b>ditches</b> at Fort Center to similar circular ditches used for agriculture in pre-Columbian Colombia.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ditch</b> {{is still}} visible in short sections, {{such as a}} 330-yard stretch in Denton Golf Course. In the parts which survive, <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> is 4–5yards wide and up to 5feet deep. Part of the {{earthwork}} is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.|$|E
5|$|Fairfax {{wrote that}} his second-in-command, Major-General Lambert, {{could not get}} up to him, and so charged in another place. A lane, the present-day Atterwith Lane, crossed <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> on this flank, and some {{accounts}} suggest that several units were easy targets for the Royalist musketeers as they advanced along the lane only four abreast. When a small embankment alongside <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> at this point was removed in the 1960s, several hundred musket balls were recovered.|$|E
5|$|The Royalists {{occupied}} the low-lying moor, behind a drainage ditch that Rupert noted {{as an effective}} obstacle to a cavalry charge. There is some dispute {{over the course of}} <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> {{at the time of the}} battle. Some contemporary accounts support the contention by later historians that it was non-existent on the Royalists' right wing. On the other hand, a near-contemporary plan of the Royalist dispositions by Rupert's chief engineer, Bernard de Gomme, shows <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> in its present-day alignment. It is generally accepted that <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> was at least less of an obstacle on the Royalist right.|$|E
50|$|During <b>the</b> <b>ditching,</b> {{at impact}} {{with the water}} surface, the cockpit door and left main landing gear were {{detached}} from the aircraft. All nine passengers survived <b>the</b> <b>ditching</b> and were rescued by a nearby diver's boat. The passengers reported that after <b>the</b> <b>ditching,</b> <b>the</b> pilot was injured {{and appeared to be}} unconscious as he did not try to remove himself from the aeroplane. The pilot actually went down with the aircraft despite the efforts of some passengers who tried to remove him from his seat while the aeroplane was sinking.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Town <b>Ditch</b> is {{a replica}} of <b>the</b> type of <b>ditch</b> which {{was used in the}} towns founded by the early pioneers. The water carried by <b>the</b> <b>ditches</b> was used for drinking, cooking, washing, etc.|$|R

5|$|There {{are three}} {{identifiable}} periods of medieval activity at Buckton Castle: the initial construction phase, {{which resulted in}} the creation of <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> and the building of the curtain wall and gatehouse; the re-cutting of <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> and further building work behind the curtain wall; and finally deliberate demolition (slighting). The castle is first mentioned in 1360, and little datable material has been recovered from the site four sherds of Pennine Gritty Ware broadly dated to the late 12th century.|$|E
5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into <b>the</b> <b>ditch.</b> Then <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in <b>the</b> <b>ditch.</b> These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can only say that those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

50|$|During a later phase, c. 3300 BC, three {{concentric}} segmented ditches {{were placed}} around the hilltop site, the outermost with {{a diameter of}} 365 metres. The causeways interrupting <b>the</b> <b>ditches</b> vary in width from a few centimetres to 7 m. Material from <b>the</b> <b>ditches</b> was piled up to create internal banks, <b>the</b> deepest <b>ditches</b> and largest banks are on the outer circuit.|$|R

5|$|In 1859, six guns, four 12-pounders and two 12-pound carronades, were {{installed}} on the bastion, and four years later, five 32-pounders were mounted on the fortification. The earliest defences of {{the southern end of}} the city of Gibraltar included the 16th century Charles V Wall, Flat Bastion, South Bastion, Southport Gate, and Southport Ditch. The complex of defences also included Southport Ditch which was depicted in the 1627 map of Gibraltar by Spanish engineer Luis Bravo de Acuña. On that map which is held by the British Museum, <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> is shown as a Fosso south of Southport Gate. It was a large trench which extended from the southwestern aspect of the 16th century South Bastion to the Flat Bastion at Prince Edward's Gate. The width of <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> is now indicated by that of Ragged Staff Gates, which initially served as a water gate. By the late 19th century, <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> was utilised as an ordnance depot, with a magazine constructed in the 1880s. However, by the early 20th century, that same magazine was used as a pump house. After World War I and reclamation of land, the Ragged Staff Gates were opened to vehicular traffic. Gibraltar's Sunken Gardens, a 19th-century market garden, were a remnant of the western portion of the Southport Ditch, and were filled in at the time of the 1967 Referendum Gate. Trafalgar Cemetery represents an eastern remnant of <b>the</b> <b>ditch.</b>|$|E
5|$|Isa ibn Musa, the Caliph's nephew, {{was sent}} against Medina with 4,000 men, but Muhammad refused {{to abandon the}} holy city and insisted on meeting the Abbasid attack there. In the meantime, he imitated the actions of Muhammad, like {{restoring}} the famous ditch around the city. Muhammad's supporters nevertheless began deserting him. When Isa appeared before the city, he waited {{a few days before}} <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> and repeatedly offered amnesty. Then his troops laid a few doors over <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> and entered Medina, where Muhammad and his remaining 300 supporters fell fighting on 6 December 762. Muhammad's corpse was beheaded and his head dispatched to the Caliph.|$|E
5|$|The {{dearth of}} {{artefacts}} recovered from Buckton Castle, {{and the lack}} of finely finished stonework, might indicate that the site was never finished, however the re-cutting of <b>the</b> <b>ditch</b> suggests either an extended period of occupancy of abandonment followed by repairs to the fortifications.|$|E

50|$|The Kunstgräben {{were often}} covered by rough boards (Schwarten). These acted, {{on the one}} hand, to keep <b>the</b> <b>ditches</b> clear and protect them from {{becoming}} overgrown and, on the other hand, to protect <b>the</b> <b>ditches</b> from destruction by cattle. In addition, it also helped to defend the owners of <b>the</b> <b>ditches</b> from <b>the</b> claims of neighbouring landowners, who had otherwise to be compensated {{for the loss of}} income and land resulting from the construction of Kunstgräben and who often brought claims as a result of allegedly drowned livestock and game.|$|R
