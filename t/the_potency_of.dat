5|$|By definition, antagonists display no {{efficacy}} {{to activate}} the receptors they bind. Antagonists do not maintain the ability to activate a receptor. Once bound, however, antagonists inhibit the function of agonists, inverse agonists, and partial agonists. In functional antagonist assays, a dose-response curve measures {{the effect of the}} ability of a range of concentrations of antagonists to reverse the activity of an agonist. <b>The</b> <b>potency</b> <b>of</b> an antagonist is usually defined by its half maximal inhibitory concentration (i.e., IC50 value). This can be calculated for a given antagonist by determining the concentration of antagonist needed to elicit half inhibition of the maximum biological response of an agonist. Elucidating an IC50 value is useful for comparing <b>the</b> <b>potency</b> <b>of</b> drugs with similar efficacies, however the dose-response curves produced by both drug antagonists must be similar. The lower the IC50 the greater <b>the</b> <b>potency</b> <b>of</b> the antagonist, and the lower the concentration of drug that is required to inhibit the maximum biological response. Lower concentrations of drugs may be associated with fewer side-effects.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) isolated from particular bacterial strains can bias innate immune responses toward different signal transduction pathways thereby eliciting unique patterns of cytokines. Heterogeneity in the structure of lipid A (the active component of LPS) and possible contaminations with other inflammatory components have made it difficult to confirm these observations and dissect molecular motifs that may be responsible for modulatory properties. To address these issues, we have examined, for the first time, the ability of a range of well defined synthetic lipid As and isolated LPS and lipid A preparations to induce the production {{of a wide range of}} cytokines in three different mouse cell types. It was found that, for a given compound, <b>the</b> <b>potencies</b> <b>of</b> production <b>of</b> <b>the</b> various cytokines differed significantly. An additive model, in which a chemical change in the structure of a compound effects <b>the</b> <b>potencies</b> <b>of</b> all cytokines in the same manner, could describe <b>the</b> <b>potencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cytokines for all compounds. Thus, no evidence was found that the structure of lipid A can modulate the pattern of cytokine production. In addition, the statistical analysis showed that the relative ordering <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>potencies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compounds was identical in the different cell types and that structural features such as the presence of a 3 -deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid moiety, anomeric phosphate, lipid length, and acylation pattern were important for pro-inflammatory activity. Finally, it was found that transcriptional and post-transcription control mechanisms determine <b>potencies</b> and efficacies <b>of</b> cytokine production in cell-specific manners...|$|R
5|$|Jains cite inequalities, sufferings, {{and pain}} as {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} karma. Various types of karma are classified according to their effects on <b>the</b> <b>potency</b> <b>of</b> the soul. The Jain theory seeks to explain the karmic process by specifying the various causes of karmic influx (āsrava) and bondage (bandha), placing equal emphasis on deeds themselves, and the intentions behind those deeds. The Jain karmic theory attaches great responsibility to individual actions, and eliminates any reliance on some supposed existence of divine grace or retribution. The Jain doctrine also holds that it is possible for us to both modify our karma, and to obtain release from it, through the austerities and purity of conduct.|$|E

5|$|Mups {{are members}} of a large family of low-molecular weight (~19kDa) {{proteins}} known as lipocalins. They have a characteristic structure of eight beta sheets arranged in an anti-parallel beta barrel open on one face, with alpha helices at both ends. Consequently, they form a characteristic glove shape, encompassing a cup-like pocket that binds small organic chemicals with high affinity. A number of these ligands bind to mouse Mups, including 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (abbreviated as SBT or DHT), 6-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-heptanone (HMH) and 2,3 dihydro-exo-brevicomin (DHB). These are all urine-specific chemicals that have been shown to act as pheromones—molecular signals excreted by one individual that trigger an innate behavioural response in another member of the same species. Mouse Mups have also been shown to function as pheromone stabilizers, providing a slow release mechanism that extends <b>the</b> <b>potency</b> <b>of</b> volatile pheromones in male urine scent marks. Given the diversity of Mups in rodents, it was originally thought that different Mups may have differently shaped binding pockets and therefore bind different pheromones. However, detailed studies found that most variable sites are located {{on the surface of the}} proteins, and appear to have little effect on ligand binding.|$|E

40|$|Anti{{histamine}}s inhibit histamine signaling {{by blocking}} histamine H 1 receptor (H 1 R) or suppressing H 1 R signaling as inverse agonists. The H 1 R gene is upregulated {{in patients with}} pollinosis, and its expression level is correlated with the severity of nasal symptoms. Here, we show that antihistamine suppressed upregulation of histidine decarboxylase (HDC) mRNA expression in patients with pollinosis, and its expression level was correlated with that of H 1 R mRNA. Certain antihistamines, including mepyramine and diphenhydramine, suppress toluene- 2, 4 -diisocyanate (TDI) -induced upregulation of HDC gene expression and increase HDC activity in TDI-sensitized rats. However, d-chlorpheniramine did not demonstrate any effect. <b>The</b> <b>potencies</b> <b>of</b> antihistamine suppressive effects on HDC mRNA elevation were different from their H 1 R receptor binding affinities.
