5|$|However, {{the focal}} point of the {{painting}} is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts.

More specifically, the crook of his arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.|$|E

5|$|Iron Maiden {{were formed}} on Christmas Day in 1975 by bassist Steve Harris {{shortly after he}} left his {{previous}} group, Smiler.

H. W. Lawton's review published six years earlier mentions a second copy in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, V.20973 (now RES P- V- 752 (6)), an omission also noted by Tillotson.|$|E
5|$|Rudolf Simek {{states that}} the obscurity {{of the names of}} the objects in the tale of Hjúki and Bil may {{indicate}} that Snorri derived them from a folktale, and that the form of the tale of <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Moon (featuring a man with a pole and a woman with a bushel) is also found in modern folklore in Scandinavia, England, and Northern Germany.|$|E
5|$|Some critics {{consider}} <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Moone, {{along with}} Kepler's Somnium, {{to be one}} of the first works of science fiction. The book was well known in the 17th century, and even inspired parodies by Cyrano de Bergerac and Aphra Behn, but has been neglected in critical history. Recent studies have focused on Godwin's theories of language, the mechanics of lunar travel, and his religious position and sympathies as evidenced in the book.|$|E
