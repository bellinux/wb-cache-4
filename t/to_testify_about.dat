5|$|Hess {{acquired}} full {{ownership of}} the Jets on February 9, 1984, when Helen Dillion sold her 25%interest to him. Before the season, New York traded quarterback Richard Todd to the New Orleans Saints. New York began its season with veteran Pat Ryan as starting quarterback; O'Brien was spending most weekdays waiting <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>about</b> an altercation at the Studio 54 nightclub, at which Jets players had been present and, by some accounts, involved. The Jets had a second consecutive mediocre season, finishing 7–9 after starting the season 6–2.|$|E
5|$|On February 23, Shakur's {{attorneys}} filed papers asking Judge Appleby {{to subpoena}} FBI Director Clarence Kelley, Senator Frank Church {{and other federal}} and New York law enforcement officials <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>about</b> the Counter Intelligence Program, which they alleged was designed to harass and disrupt black activist organizations. Kunstler had previously been successful in subpoenaing Kelley and Church for the trials of American Indian Movement (AIM) members charged with murdering FBI agents. The motion (argued March 2)—which also {{asked the court to}} require the production of memos, tapes, documents, and photographs of alleged COINTELPRO involvement from 1970 to 1973—was denied.|$|E
5|$|Adams filed a countersuit, {{claiming}} {{the case was}} in poor taste and frivolous, and that, as author of the Nancy Drew series, she retained the rights to her work. Although Adams had written many of the titles after 1953, and edited others, she {{claimed to be the}} author of all of the early titles. In fact, she had rewritten the older titles and was not their original author. When Mildred Benson was called <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>about</b> her work for the Syndicate, Benson's role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams' claims to authorship. The court ruled that Grosset had the rights to publish the original series as they were in print in 1980, but did not own characters or trademarks. Furthermore, any new publishers chosen by Adams were completely within their rights to print new titles.|$|E
25|$|In September 2013, he {{was asked}} by UCI's new president, Brian Cookson, <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> {{completely}} <b>about</b> his doping. Armstrong refused <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> until and unless he got a complete amnesty, which Cookson said is most unlikely to happen.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike fact {{witnesses}}, who {{are limited}} <b>to</b> <b>testifying</b> <b>about</b> {{what they know}} or have observed, expert witnesses {{have the ability to}} express opinion because, as their name suggests, they are presumed to be [...] "experts" [...] in a certain topic. They possess specialized knowledge about the topic. Expert witnesses are called upon <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> on matters of mental health (clinical expertise) or other areas of expertise such as social, experimental, cognitive, or developmental. The role of being an expert witness is not primary and it is usually performed in conjunction with another role such as that of researcher, academic, evaluator, or clinical psychologist. Clinical forensic psychologists evaluate a defendant and are then called upon as expert witnesses <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> on the mental state of the defendant.|$|R

5|$|On December 5, 1989, Judge Roth found Taylor {{guilty of}} the first-degree child rape and first-degree murder of Charla Nicole King. During the penalty phase of Taylor's trial, his {{half-sister}} Leslie Beale traveled from Florida <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>about</b> his harsh treatment under his stepfather and the three years that Taylor spent in a sex offender program at a Florida mental institution. On December 19, Taylor became the first convict in 40 years {{to be sent to}} death row by a Weber County court. Roth said that {{the facts of the case}} outweighed any mitigating circumstances. Taylor's father Albert attended most of his son's court proceedings until he died of heart failure on October 8, 1990. Taylor said he was not permitted to attend his father's funeral.|$|E
5|$|The {{outcome of}} the case turned largely on the {{question}} of who had written the Nancy Drew series. Adams filed a countersuit, claiming that, as author of the Nancy Drew Mystery Stories, she retained the rights to her work. Although Adams had written many Nancy Drew titles after 1953 and edited others, she claimed to be the author of all of the early titles. In fact, she had rewritten the older titles, but was not the original author. When Mildred Benson, the author of the early Nancy Drew volumes, was called <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>about</b> her work for the Syndicate, Benson's role in writing the manuscripts of early titles was revealed in court with extensive documentation, contradicting Adams' claims to authorship. The court ruled that Grosset had the rights to publish the original series of both Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys as they were in print in 1980, but did not own characters or trademarks. Furthermore, any new publishers chosen by Adams were completely within their rights to print new titles.|$|E

25|$|On February 20, 1931, Vivian Gordon {{was angry}} about a {{conviction}} that had resulted in her losing custody of her 16-year-old daughter.

25|$|In 1975, Kunstler again defended AIM {{members in}} the slaying of two FBI agents at Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, {{not far from the}} site of the Wounded Knee incident. At the trial in 1976, Kunstler subpoenaed {{prominent}} government officials <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>about</b> the existence of a Counter-Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO) against Native American activists. District Judge Edward J. McManus approved Kunstler's attempt to subpoena FBI director Clarence M. Kelley.|$|E

25|$|After she retired, Ringer {{was invited}} <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>about</b> the {{convention}} before the Judiciary Subcommittee on Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks.

25|$|Promoted to lieutenant, he {{reported}} to the Naval Academy on August 16, 1905 as an instructor in navigation and mechanics. In February 1906, he was called before a Congressional subcommittee <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>about</b> {{his role as the}} disciplinary officer in charge during a notorious hazing incident that had resulted in an upper class man being acquitted at court-martial for the injury of a fourth class man on the grounds that he and other upper class men had understood Snyder to have tacitly encouraged the hazing.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes, {{rather than}} {{threatening}} marks, the extortionists {{would tell them}} that they had <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> in court <b>about</b> a prostitution ring, but that if they paid “bail money,” someone else could be released <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> instead. When dealing with high profile targets, this method was often more effective than attempting to bully them.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{defendant}} {{was granted a}} retrial after the jury had found him guilty which ended in a mistrial because Amina Khaalis, a survivor of the massacre and {{the daughter of the}} Hanafi leader, refused to be cross-examined as she had [...] "suffered irreparable psychological trauma" [...] and it was thought that it was [...] "highly probable" [...] that she would suffer psychiatric injury if she were <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> again <b>about</b> the murders.|$|R
25|$|If {{convicted of}} these charges, Lindh could have {{received}} {{up to three}} life sentences and 90 additional years in prison. On February 13, 2002, he {{pleaded not guilty to}} all 10 charges. The court scheduled an evidence suppression hearing, at which Lindh would have been able <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>about</b> the details of the torture to which he claimed he was subjected. The government faced the problem that a key piece of evidence – Lindh's confession – might be excluded from evidence as having been forced under duress (i.e. torture).|$|E

The resolution holds Lois Lerner, one of the central Internal Revenue Service officials involved in the 2013 IRS scandal, in contempt of Congress for her refusal <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>about</b> the scandal before Issa's committee in response to a subpoena.|$|E
25|$|Witt's last {{appearance}} before Congress came in 1955. Harvey Matusow, former CPUSA member, had previously testified before Congress against his former comrades. However, in 1954, Matusow published a book, False Witness, {{in which he}} recanted his anti-communist testimony. In April 1955, the Subcommittee on Internal Security learned that Witt had obtained a cash donation from the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union to help Matusow get his book published. Witt was called before the Subcommittee on Internal Security on April 18 <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>about</b> {{his involvement in the}} Matusow affair.

5000|$|After {{the state}} conviction, federal charges of forced labor, {{document}} servitude and harboring {{an illegal immigrant}} were dropped.

Miller added the U.S. attorney's decision to drop federal charges was [...] "in no way a statement regarding {{the strength of the}} government's case." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{judge had}} already {{excluded}} evidence {{which could not}} be connected to Bonds because of Anderson's refusal <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>about</b> his alleged knowledge of Bonds' alleged connection to the evidence. The same applies to several other pieces of evidence, which Bonds' attorneys asked to be excluded in the January 10, 2011 filing. A hearing was set to be held on the exclusion of the testimony and the additional evidence on January 21, 2011. A report in the New York Times had earlier suggested it was likely that Bonds would not get prison time even if convicted, after pro cyclist Tammy Thomas received house arrest and probation for similar crimes in the BALCO scandal, in a case decided by the very same judge presiding over the Bonds case.|$|E
25|$|Rogers was {{scheduled}} to be put to death on Valentine's Day, 1999, in Florida, but he immediately appealed to the Florida Supreme Court claiming that the State had not presented enough evidence to support the charges. Rogers also argued that the trial court should have granted the defense's motions for a mistrial because a witness was allowed <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>about</b> a misdemeanor for which Rogers was convicted in California; he also claimed the prosecution was also allowed to present an improper argument during closing arguments. His appeal was delayed until March, 2001, and was ultimately denied. In April 2005, Rogers filed another appeal, which is still pending. Should his death sentence ever be overturned based on a charge of prosecutorial misconduct, he will no longer be eligible for execution in the State of California.|$|E
25|$|In 1877, Patterson was criminally {{prosecuted for}} defrauding depositors, {{including}} {{encouraging people to}} deposit money when he knew {{that they would not}} be repaid. Foolishly, Patterson did not prepare for trial, hiring a lawyer at the last minute. Hungerford was the first witness <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> <b>about</b> the bank's beginnings. Later testimony showed that Patterson knew his bank was going to fail for the past five years. According to an auditor's report, in January 23, 1875, Patterson's bank had liabilities of $96,669.89, but only $5,931.30 of available resources and $36,498.47 of contingent resources, i.e., money in Patterson's individual account, leaving an overall shortage of $54,240.12. Patterson claimed that he was actually solvent at all times because bank investments in real estate covered any alleged shortages. The presiding judge did not buy his story and found him guilty of fraud.|$|E

As a result, Gein's initial confession was ruled inadmissible. Schley died of heart failure at age 43 in 1968, before Gein's trial. Many who knew Schley said he was traumatized by the horror of Gein's crimes, and this, along with the fear of having <b>to</b> <b>testify</b> (especially <b>about</b> assaulting Gein), caused his death. One of his friends said: [...] "He {{was a victim of}} Ed Gein as surely as if he had butchered him." ...|$|R
