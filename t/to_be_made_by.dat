5|$|Development {{began in}} September 2014, when Kasbekar signed Madhvani and Kapoor {{for a film}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> Bling Unplugged and Fox Star Studios. Saiwyn Quadras and Sanyuktha Chawla worked on the script, with {{principal}} photography taking place in Mumbai. The film features music by Vishal Khurana, with lyrics written by Prasoon Joshi. Neerja was released on 19 February 2016 to positive critical reception, with praise directed to Kapoor's performance, {{and became one of}} the highest-grossing Bollywood films featuring a female protagonist.|$|E
5|$|Of {{concern to}} breeders is the {{condition}} known as uterine inertia, {{an inability to}} expel the foetus due to weak muscles. This condition was present {{in one of the}} foundation cats and appears in some Singapura females today. Individuals with uterine inertia may require deliveries <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> Caesarean section. Another issue that affects the breed is Pyruvate kinase deficiency, which leads to hemolytic anemia. Typical symptoms includes lethargy, diarrhea, lack of appetite, poor coat quality, weight loss and jaundice.|$|E

5|$|After Aubers Ridge, {{the corps}} was then rested {{in a quiet}} sector until September, when it {{deployed}} for the Battle of Loos. The initial attack was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> three divisions, with the Meerut Division leading {{the attack on the}} Indian front; Blackader's brigade, with two Gurkha battalions and the 2nd Leicesters, was on its right flank. Whilst the attack successfully crossed no-man's land under cover of the barrage, the right flank of the brigade was caught up in defensive wire, and only one battalion successfully made their way into the German trenches; the brigade lost momentum and dug in.|$|E
5|$|During Princess Elizabeth's 1950 tour of Canada, she {{was promised}} a Dominion gift of trumpeter swans, the {{arrangements}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> Peter Scott. Canadian officials discovered the only swans tame enough to capture were at Lonesome Lake in British Columbia {{as they had}} been fed for decades by conservationist Ralph Edwards. In 1952, with the help of Ralph and his daughter Trudy, five were captured and flown to England, the first time trumpeter swans had ever flown across the Atlantic (although in the 19th century swans had been brought by ship to European zoos). One unfortunately died, but the remaining four thrived at WWT Slimbridge for many years.|$|E
5|$|During the infection, {{rotavirus}} produces mRNA {{for both}} protein biosynthesis and gene replication. Most of the rotavirus proteins accumulate in viroplasm, where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled. Viroplasm is formed around the cell nucleus {{as early as}} two hours after virus infection, and consists of viral factories thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> two viral nonstructural proteins: NSP5 and NSP2. Inhibition of NSP5 by RNA interference results in a sharp decrease in rotavirus replication. The DLPs migrate to the endoplasmic reticulum where they obtain their third, outer layer (formed by VP7 and VP4). The progeny viruses are released from the cell by lysis.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1920s and early 1930s, the {{politicians}} became less {{satisfied with the}} solution. Kjeller was considered {{too far away from}} the city center (about , but along the mainline railway), while travel to Gressholmen needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> ferry. The politicians also wanted to have a combined land- and seaplane airport, and it had become clear that serving Gressholmen was interfering with ship traffic. A committee was established to look into the matter. While considering many locations, it made detail surveys of only two places: Ekeberg, located southeast of the city center, and Fornebu, to the southwest.|$|E
5|$|Geneforge {{stemmed from}} the idea of {{creating}} a horde of creatures and the ability to care for those creatures or send them to their deaths. The choice was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the player. From this point, Vogel considered who would be able to gain such powers, how they would control them and how these creatures would be treated. The game was developed with the intention of giving players choices; which factions to side with, how non-Shaper human outsiders are treated and whether to pursue goals through combat or diplomacy. Unlike most role-playing games, Geneforge was designed so that {{it would be possible to}} complete the game without using violence. Vogel cited , , Deus Ex and EverQuest as influences.|$|E
5|$|Gewirtz {{spent five}} years {{developing}} the film's premise before working on what became his first original screenplay. After he completed the script in 2002, Imagine Entertainment purchased it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> Universal Studios, with Imagine co-founder Ron Howard attached to direct. After Howard stepped down, his Imagine partner Brian Grazer began {{looking for a new}} director to helm the project, and ultimately hired Lee to do so. Principal photography began in June 2005 and concluded in August of that year; filming took place on location in New York City. Inside Man premiered in New York on March 20, 2006 before being released in North America on March 24, 2006. Upon release, the film received a generally positive critical response and was a commercial success, grossing over $184 million worldwide.|$|E

5|$|In 1195 Walter {{issued an}} {{ordinance}} by which four knights were appointed in every hundred {{to act as}} guardians of the peace, a precursor {{to the office of}} Justice of the Peace. His use of the knights, who appear {{for the first time in}} political life, is the first sign of the rise of this class who, either as members of parliament or justices of the peace, later became the mainstay of English government. In 1198, Walter requested a carucage, or plough-tax, of five shillings on every plough-land, or carucate, under cultivation. However, difficulties arose over the assessments, so the justiciar ordered them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> a sworn jury in every hundred. It is likely that those jurors were elected.|$|E
5|$|Ironside {{arrived at}} British General Headquarters at 06:00am on 20 May, {{the same day}} that {{continental}} communications between France and Belgium was cut. When Ironside made his proposals known to Gort, Gort replied such an attack was impossible. Seven of his nine divisions were engaged on the Scheldt and even if it was possible to withdraw them, it would create a gap between the Belgians and British which the enemy could exploit and encircle the former. The BEF had been marching and fighting for nine days and was now running short of ammunition. The main effort had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> the French to the south.|$|E

Any existing enactment which applied to the Militia, Yeomanry or Volunteers could be extended to the Territorial Force by an Order in Council. A number of enactments were subsequently applied by an order of 19 March 1908: s.20 of the Railway Act 1842, s.12 of the Railway Act 1844, s.52 of the National Defence Act 1888, s.43 of the Friendly Societies Act 1896, the whole of the Officers Commissions Act 1862, and part of s.6 of the Regulation of Forces Act 1871.|$|E

This attack began near the village of Magdhaba and the Wadi El Arish, on the virtually featureless battleground, when the British Empire artillery opened fire {{at the same time as}} Chaytor's group moved towards the Ottoman garrison's right and rear.|$|E
