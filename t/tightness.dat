5|$|On April 11, 2017, Kemp {{was placed}} on the 10-day {{disabled}} list due to left hamstring <b>tightness.</b> On April 29, Kemp became the first Brave to have a three home run game since Mark Teixeira in 2008.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, he {{experienced}} <b>tightness</b> {{in the same}} hamstring he had hurt earlier in the year, and the Dodgers shut him down indefinitely. He eventually rejoined the Dodgers lineup on September 17, and had four hits (including two doubles) in four at bats. He played regularly {{in an attempt to}} get his timing back before the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Asthma is {{a common}} {{long-term}} inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. Symptoms include episodes of wheezing, coughing, chest <b>tightness,</b> and shortness of breath. These episodes may occur {{a few times a}} day or a few times per week. Depending on the person, they may become worse at night or with exercise.|$|E
5|$|Glatiramer acetate is {{generally}} well tolerated. The most common secondary effect with glatiramer acetate after skin {{problem is a}} post-injection reaction manifested by flushing, chest <b>tightness,</b> heart palpitations, breathlessness, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes and does not require additional treatment.|$|E
5|$|Nash has {{a medical}} {{condition}} called spondylolisthesis, which causes muscle <b>tightness</b> and back pain. Due to the condition, {{when he is not}} playing in basketball games, he lies on his back rather than sitting on the bench to keep his muscles from stiffening.|$|E
5|$|Studies have {{suggested}} a strong association exists between an increased {{body mass index}} {{and the development of}} plantar fasciitis in the non-athletic population; this association between weight and plantar fasciitis has not been observed in the athletic population. Achilles tendon <b>tightness</b> and inappropriate footwear have also been identified as significant risk factors.|$|E
5|$|During spring {{training}} in 2014, Diamondbacks manager Kirk Gibson decided that Corbin would start on Opening Day. However, Corbin felt arm <b>tightness</b> during a {{spring training}} start. An MRI revealed {{damage to his}} ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow. He underwent Tommy John surgery, and missed the entire 2014 season. The Diamondbacks placed Corbin on the 15-day disabled list on March 30, and transferred him to the 60-day disabled list on April 4, in order to open a roster spot for Roger Kieschnick, who they claimed off waivers.|$|E
5|$|In COPD, it {{may take}} longer to breathe out than to breathe in. Chest <b>tightness</b> may occur but is not common and {{may be caused by}} another problem. Those with {{obstructed}} airflow may have wheezing or decreased sounds with air entry on examination of the chest with a stethoscope. A barrel chest is a characteristic sign of COPD, but is relatively uncommon. Tripod positioning may occur as the disease worsens.|$|E
5|$|The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{warned in}} 2014 that {{over-the-counter}} acne products containing benzoyl peroxide and/or salicylic acid, including Proactiv, can cause severe irritation, {{as well as}} rare but life-threatening allergic reactions. Consumers were advised to stop using the products if they experience hives or itching, and to seek emergency medical attention if they feel faint, or experience throat <b>tightness,</b> breathing problems, or swelling of the eyes, face, lips or tongue. The FDA noted that it remains unclear whether the reactions are caused by the active ingredients, inactive ingredients or a combination.|$|E
5|$|He is the player's first {{opponent}} {{in all of}} his roles and is famous for his weakness and cowardice. These elements are considered by critics to be stereotypes of French people. These characteristics were emphasized by the developer of the Wii game which included cutscenes which depict Glass Joe in French settings. Glass Joe {{is considered one of the}} most well-known characters in the Punch-Out!! series and a Nintendo icon. His name has been used to describe poor performance by sportspeople and teams. In The Wii game his dialogue consists of him pleading not for the player to strike him in the jaw, complaints about the <b>tightness</b> of his gloves, and counting to ten in French.|$|E
5|$|On May19, 2002, Rivera {{recorded}} his 225th career save, surpassing Dave Righetti as the Yankees' franchise leader in saves. Over {{the next few}} months of the season, injuries limited his playing time. He was first placed on the disabled list in June due to a groin strain, though his first-half numbers, which included a 1.47ERA and 21saves, earned him an All-Star selection. In a game on July14, Rivera endured one of his worst outings, allowing six earned runs, including a walk-off grand slam. One week later, he was placed on the disabled list with a shoulder strain. Rivera was activated on August8 after receiving a cortisone shot but returned to the disabled list after a recurrence of shoulder <b>tightness.</b> For the season, Rivera recorded a 2.74ERA and 28saves in 32opportunities in just 46innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} {{is usually}} diagnosed by {{a health care}} provider after consideration of a person's presenting history, risk factors, and clinical examination. Tenderness to palpation along the inner aspect of the heel bone on the {{sole of the foot}} may be elicited during the physical examination. The foot may have limited dorsiflexion due to <b>tightness</b> of the calf muscles or the Achilles tendon. Dorsiflexion of the foot may elicit the pain due to stretching of the plantar fascia with this motion. Diagnostic imaging studies are not usually needed to diagnose plantar fasciitis. However, in certain cases a physician may decide imaging studies (such as X-rays, diagnostic ultrasound or MRI) are warranted to rule out serious causes of foot pain.|$|E
5|$|The disease-modifying {{treatments}} {{have several}} adverse effects. One {{of the most}} common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with intramuscular injections). Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest <b>tightness,</b> heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes. More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, and acute myeloid leukemia (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated).|$|E
5|$|The upper {{creature}} {{may be a}} dog or a cat. Blood {{pours out}} of its mouth onto the head and body of its prey, a chimera rendered as owl-like with human facial characteristics. The prey unsuccessfully struggles to flee from its captor. The lower figure's human aspect is most notable {{in the details of}} its mouth and genitalia. Both figures are positioned in the centre foreground of the canvas, and are each mutilated and covered in blood, their physical discomfort contrasted against the flat, neutral background typical of Bacon's paintings. The figures exhibit many elements found in his early work, noticeably the expressive broad strokes set against the <b>tightness</b> of the flat, nondescript background. The link with the biblical Crucifixion is made through the raised arms of the lower creature, and the T-shaped cross.|$|E
5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This may lead to angina pectoris (chest pain or <b>tightness</b> on exertion) or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E
5|$|Kershaw {{made his}} seventh {{straight}} opening day start, tying Don Sutton for most consecutive opening day starts, and Sutton and Don Drysdale for most total opening day starts by a Dodger. On June 2, {{he struck out}} Jonathan Villar of the Milwaukee Brewers for his 2,000th career strikeout. He was the fifth youngest player in major league history to reach that mark, {{as well as the}} second fastest pitcher to 2,000 strikeouts, accomplishing the feat in 277 games (behind Randy Johnson's 262 games). He was named to his seventh straight all-star game, second most in Dodgers history after Drysdale. On July 23, Kershaw left the game due to back <b>tightness.</b> The same day, he was placed on the 10-day disabled list. He returned to the mound on September 1, but despite his extended absence, he went on to lead the National League in earned run average and wins. In 27 starts, he was 18–4 with a 2.31 ERA and 202 strikeouts.|$|E
5|$|Spiral galaxies {{consist of}} a {{rotating}} disk of stars and interstellar medium, along with a central bulge of generally older stars. Extending outward from the bulge are relatively bright arms. In the Hubble classification scheme, spiral galaxies are listed as type S, followed by a letter (a, b, or c) that indicates the degree of <b>tightness</b> of the spiral arms {{and the size of}} the central bulge. An Sa galaxy has tightly wound, poorly defined arms and possesses a relatively large core region. At the other extreme, an Sc galaxy has open, well-defined arms and a small core region. A galaxy with poorly defined arms is sometimes referred to as a flocculent spiral galaxy; in contrast to the grand design spiral galaxy that has prominent and well-defined spiral arms. The speed in which a galaxy rotates is thought to correlate with the flatness of the disc as some spiral galaxies have thick bulges, while others are thin and dense.|$|E
5|$|The 2-6-4 wheel {{arrangement}} {{was not in}} common use in Great Britain at this time, as many railway companies operated routes that required locomotives with greater fuel capacity, or short branch lines that necessitated smaller locomotives. The 2-6-4 tank engine design had only been used once before for standard gauge locomotives in Britain, on the Great Central Railway's 1Bclass freight locomotives of 1914. However, the configuration was ideal for the SECR, because of its shorter mainlines, and allowed for a long wheelbase with a leading axle to permit greater stability at speed on track curves. The <b>tightness</b> of the curves on the former LCDR mainlines had constrained the size of locomotives operating on the SECR, {{as they had been}} hastily erected during the nineteenth century to compete with those of the South Eastern Railway (SER). The longer locomotive could also accommodate a larger boiler than a 4-4-0, giving sufficient power to avoid double-heading of locomotives on heavier trains.|$|E
5|$|Reactions to {{the ants}} sting show similar {{symptoms}} to fire ant stings; namely local swelling which lasts for several days, and {{swelling of the}} lips, face and eyes may occur from a minor allergic reaction. Other common symptoms include watering of the eyes and nose, and hives or welts will begin to develop. Headaches, anxiety and flushing may also occur. Jack jumpers, bees and wasps {{are the most common}} causes of anaphylaxis from insect stings. People most commonly feel a sharp pain after these stings, similar to that from an electric shock. Some patients develop a systemic skin reaction after being stung. Localised envenomation occurs with every sting, but severe envenoming only occurs if someone has been stung many times (as many as 50 to 300 stings in adults). The heart rate increases, and blood pressure falls rapidly. Most people will only experience mild skin irritation after being stung. Those who suffer from a severe allergic reaction will show a wide variety of symptoms. This includes difficulty breathing and talking, the tongue and throat will swell up, and coughing, chest <b>tightness,</b> abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting may occur. Others may lose consciousness and collapse (sometimes people may not collapse), and confusion. Children who get stung will show symptoms such as floppiness and paleness if a severe allergic reaction occurs.|$|E
5|$|Recovering in {{time for}} the 2010–11 season, Edler {{continued}} to improve and was on pace to record new career-highs in goals, assists and points when he suffered a back injury in January 2011. Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis told reporters that Edler had been experiencing <b>tightness</b> in his back at several times in the season, but an open-ice hit against Dallas Stars forward Jamie Benn during a game on 24 January might have contributed to his back problems. Edler underwent microdisectomy surgery to relieve pressure on a herniated disk and was sidelined for two-and-a-half months, returning for the second-last game of the regular season. Finishing the season with eight goals and 33 points over 51 games, he ranked second among team defencemen in scoring, behind Ehrhoff. His 24 minutes and 17 seconds of average ice time per game also led the Canucks. As the Canucks won the Presidents' Trophy {{for the first time in}} franchise history, the team entered the 2011 playoffs with the first seed in the West. Eliminating the Chicago Blackhawks, Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks, the Canucks advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 17 years. Facing the Boston Bruins, the team lost the series in seven games. Following their defeat, it was revealed that several Canucks players had been playing with injuries, including Edler, who played Game 7 with two broken fingers. He ranked second among Canucks defensemen and third in the League overall with 11 points (2 goals and 9 assists) in 25 games.|$|E

25|$|Gelfand is {{considered}} a pioneering researcher {{on the concept of}} tightness-looseness. She is credited with defining the tightness-looseness classification system, which assesses how much a culture adheres to social norms and tolerates deviance. Tight cultures are more restrictive, with stricter disciplinary measures for norm violations while loose cultures have weaker social norms and a higher tolerance for deviant behavior. Gelfand found that a history of threats, such as natural disasters, high population density, or vulnerability to infectious diseases, is associated with greater <b>tightness.</b> Her research has shown that <b>tightness</b> allows cultures to coordinate more effectively to survive threats.|$|E
25|$|On August 19, placed RHP Yu Darvish on the 10-day {{disabled}} list with back <b>tightness,</b> recalled LHP Edward Paredes from AAA Oklahoma City and optioned OF Joc Pederson to AAA Oklahoma City.|$|E
25|$|Another subject given 2mg {{reported}} “tightness in his throat”. He had <b>tightness</b> in the stomach, tingling in pretibial areas, {{and developed}} a purplish hue in the face indicating blood circulation problems. He vomited after 3 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{direction}} in which the yarn is spun is called twist. Yarns are characterized as S-twist or Z-twist according to the direction of spinning (see diagram). <b>Tightness</b> of twist is measured in TPI (twists per inch or turns per inch).|$|E
25|$|The <b>tightness</b> of the M–σ {{relation}} {{suggests that}} some kind of feedback acts to maintain the connection between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion, in spite of processes like galaxy mergers and gas accretion that might be expected to increase the scatter over time.|$|E
25|$|Reported {{side effects}} include anxiety, restlessness, muscle tension, jaw <b>tightness,</b> pupil dilation, tachycardia, headaches, nausea, and vomiting, among other effects that might {{commonly}} {{be attributed to}} LSD, psilocybin, DMT and MDMA, such as open-eye visuals, closed eye visuals and an altered state of mind.|$|E
25|$|Closer Troy Percival {{was placed}} on the {{disabled}} list for precautionary measures following his removal from a game in which he felt <b>tightness</b> in his hamstring after striking out a batter and then falling to the ground. Percival threw several warm-up pitches but then left the game.|$|E
25|$|A thin Kevlar window {{has been}} used by the NA48 {{experiment}} at CERN to separate a vacuum vessel from a vessel at nearly atmospheric pressure, both 192cm in diameter. The window has provided vacuum <b>tightness</b> combined with reasonably small amount of material (only 0.3% to 0.4% of radiation length).|$|E
25|$|The man may {{straddle}} the woman, {{taking the}} woman's legs between his. This restricts and further controls the woman's movements, {{and the man}} can increase the <b>tightness</b> on the penis by pressing the woman's thighs together. However, this increases vaginal friction and makes thrusting more difficult.|$|E
25|$|Asthma is {{the most}} common reason for {{presenting}} to the emergency room with shortness of breath. It {{is the most}} common lung disease in both developing and developed countries affecting about 5% of the population. Other symptoms include wheezing, <b>tightness</b> in the chest, and a non productive cough.|$|E
