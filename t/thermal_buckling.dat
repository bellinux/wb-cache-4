The pipeline installed on the seabed and left exposed have a potential to buckle, walk and change configuration under high temperature and pressure (HT/HP). This could lead to failure of the Pipeline if buckling and walking is not properly controlled or mitigated. The objective of the thesis work is to study and understand the influence of pipeline-soil interaction {{on the design of}} surface laid subsea pipeline susceptible to lateral buckling and pipeline walking. The main focus of the thesis work is on the use of snake-lay configuration as a mitigating measure under controlled buckling design and rock dumping if needed to limit feed-in into buckle and end expansions; the effect of thermal gradient on axial walking and the use of direct electric heating (DEH) to reduce rate of walking. The snake-lay configuration is achieved by installing deliberate horizontal lay imperfection to trigger a sufficient number of <b>thermal</b> <b>buckles</b> at a pre-determined location along the pipeline. The desire is to limit pipeline expansion at the connecting ends by using snake-lay design with intermittent rock dumping. The work includes performing non-linear finite element analysis (FEA) and modeling the soilpipeline interaction of as-laid pipeline using general finite (FE) element software ANSYS. The results are discussed against the relevant design criteria based on design codes DNV-OS-F 101, DNV-RP-F 110 and Subsea 7 Lateral Buckling Analysis Design Guideline. FE analyses were performed to study the lateral buckling of a 2 km VAS model with an initial out-of-straightness (OOS) under operating temperature and pressure.

40|$|The {{classical}} continuum {{theory is}} {{not capable of}} predicting failure without an external crack growth criteria and treats the interface having zero thickness. Alternatively, a nonlocal continuum theory referred to as peridynamic theory eliminates these shortcomings by utilizing formulation that uses displacements, rather than derivatives of displacements, and including material failure in its constitutive relations through the response functions. This study presents a new response function {{as part of the}} peridynamic theory to include thermal loading. Furthermore, an efficient numerical algorithm is presented for solution of peridynamic equations. Solution method relies on the discretization of peridynamic equations at collocation points resulting in a set of ordinary differential equations with respect to time. These differential equations are then integrated using explicit methods. In order to improve numerical efficiency of the computations, spatial partitioning is introduced through uniform grids as arrays of linked lists. Furthermore, the domain of interest is divided into subunits each of which is assigned to a specific processor to utilize parallel processing using OpenMP. In order to obtain the static solutions, the adaptive dynamic relaxation method is developed for the solution of peridynamic equations. Furthermore, an approach to couple peridynamic theory and finite element analysis is introduced to take advantage of their salient features. The regions in which failure is expected are modeled using peridynamics while the remaining regions are modeled utilizing finite element method.

40|$|We perform {{classical}} {{molecular dynamics}} simulations {{to investigate the}} mechanical compression effect on the thermal conductivity of the single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) forest, in which SWCNTs are closely aligned and parallel with each other. We find that the thermal conductivity can be linearly enhanced by increasing compression before the buckling of SWCNT forests, but the thermal conductivity decreases quickly with further increasing compression after the forest is buckled. Our phonon mode analysis reveals that, before buckling, the smoothness of the inter-tube interface is maintained during compression, and the inter-tube van der Waals interaction is strengthened by the compression. Consequently, the twisting-like mode (good heat carrier) is well preserved and its group velocity is increased by increasing compression, resulting in the enhancement of the <b>thermal</b> conductivity. The <b>buckling</b> phenomenon changes the circular {{cross section of the}} SWCNT into ellipse, which causes effective roughness at the inter-tube interface for the twisting motion.

40|$|Graphene has {{the ability}} to provide for a {{technological}} revolution. First isolated and characterized in 2004, this material shows promise in the field of flexible electronics. The electronic properties of graphene can be tuned by controlling the shape of the membrane. Of particular interest in this endeavor are the thermal ripples in graphene membranes. Years of theoretical work by such luminaries as Lev Landau, Rudolf Peierls, David Mermin and Herbert Wagner have established that 2 D crystals should not be thermodynamically stable. Experimental research on thin films has supported this finding. Yet graphene exists, and freestanding graphene films have been grown on large scales. It turns out that coupling between the bending and stretching phonons can stabilize the graphene in a flat, albeit rippled phase. These ripples have attracted much attention, and recent work has shown how to arrange these ripples in a variety of configurations. In this thesis, I will present work done using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to interact with freestanding graphene membranes. First I will present STM images of freestanding graphene and show how these images show signs of distortion under the electrostatic influence of the STM tip. This electrostatic attraction between the STM tip and the graphene sample can be used to pull on the graphene sample. At the same time, by employing Joule heating in order to heat graphene using the tunneling current, and exploiting the negative coefficient of thermal expansion, a repulsive thermal load can be generated. By repeatedly pulling on the graphene using the electrostatic potential, while sequentially increasing the setpoint current we can generate a <b>thermal</b> mirror <b>buckling</b> event. Slowly heating the graphene using the tunneling current, prepares a small convex region of graphene under the tip. By increasing thermal stress, as well as pulling using the out of plane electrostatic force, the graphene suddenly and irreversibly switches the sign of its curvature. This event is discovered using STM measurements and supplemented by molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, I will show how to characterize this transition using the famed Ising model. The ripples are modeled as individual Ising spins, which at low temperature exhibit antiferromagnetic coupling. By heating the graphene membrane, the strain increases, changing the antiferromagnetic coupling to ferromagnetic coupling, which characterizes the irreversible transition from a soft, flexible state to a rigid configuration...|$|R

A new composite wall panel was recently proposed to improve the fire resistance rating of LSF walls, where an insulation layer was used externally between the plasterboards {{on both sides of}} the wall frame instead of using it in the cavity. A research study using both fire tests and numerical studies was undertaken to investigate the structural and thermal behaviour of load bearing LSF walls made of both conventional and the new composite panels under standard fire conditions and to determine their fire resistance rating. This paper presents the details of finite element models of LSF wall studs developed to simulate the structural performance of LSF wall panels under standard fire conditions. Finite element analyses were conducted under both steady and transient state conditions using the time-temperature profiles measured during the fire tests. The developed models were validated using the fire test results of 11 LSF wall panels with various plasterboard/insulation configurations and load ratios. They were able to predict the fire resistance rating within five minutes. The use of accurate numerical models allowed the inclusion of various complex structural and thermal effects such as local <b>buckling,</b> <b>thermal</b> bowing and neutral axis shift that occurred in thin-walled steel studs under non-uniform elevated temperature conditions. Finite element analyses also demonstrated the improvements offered by the new composite panel system over the conventional cavity insulated system. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|In this project, the {{analytical}} and numerical {{determination of the}} hull girder deflection of inland navigation vessels is carried out. This means that this project joins together different knowledge related to shipbuilding, strength of materials, ship design, rules and regulations, drawing applied to shipbuilding and advanced Finite Element Analysis of structures. The structure of a ship suffers different types of deformations from the building stage {{to the end of}} its service. These deformations have different sources like local <b>buckling,</b> <b>thermal</b> influences, global bending moment or even weldings during workmanship. The hull girder deflection occurs when a vessel undergoes vertical bending moment, which can be caused by the lightship weight distribution, the load distribution and the wave induced global loads. The value of the hull girder deflection should be maintained within a range compatible with a proper operation of machinery and equipment onboard. For instance, some difficulties may occur in shafting but also piping. Concerning the main shaft, it can experience higher torsional moments due to the eccentricity and inefficiency because of the bigger efforts of the shaft between the bearings. When deflection occurs, piping can meet some problems like stuck liquids and important efforts in the supports. According to International Standards, hull girder deflection is limited to 1 mm per meter of ship length. As per the classification rules, no specific limits on hull girder deflections are given explicitly, but the L/D ratio is related to the criteria which allows safeguarding against excessive deflection. Studying this phenomenon is essential for the definition of the criteria allowing safeguarding against excessive deflection. This investigation deals with the determination of the response of the ship complying with Bureau Veritas Rules for the Classification of Inland Navigation Vessels, in the form of deflection, to the applied loads. The study is carried out according to the following steps: 1. The structure strength of a chemical tanker is checked according to the BV Rules for Inland Navigation Vessels using Mars Inland and the FEA software FEMAP with NX Nastran. 2. Analytical determination of the hull girder deflection of the chemical tanker 3. Numerical determination of the hull girder deflection of the chemical tanker 4. Analytical determination of the hull girder deflection of standard inland navigation vessels The analytical method consists of the calculation of the deflection of the ship due to bending, which is similar to that for a beam. The ship is considered free-free supported and has a varying moment of inertia (I), and the deflection is obtained by the second integration of the MB/EI curve. The numerical method refers to direct calculations by using Finite Element Analysis. The main aim of using FEA in structures is to obtain an accurate calculation of the hull structure response so that {{the analytical}} method can be validated.
