5|$|As noted above, the Moon's orbit is also elliptical. The Moon's {{distance}} from the Earth can vary by about 6% from its average value. Therefore, the Moon's apparent size varies with its {{distance from}} the Earth, {{and it is this}} effect that leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> total and annular eclipses. The distance of the Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect. On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen from the Earth, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular. It is only when the Moon is closer to the Earth than average (near its perigee) that a total eclipse occurs.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this theory}} allowed a {{compound}} symmetry CP to be conserved. CP combines parity P (switching left to right) with charge conjugation C (switching particles with antiparticles). Physicists were again surprised when in 1964, James Cronin and Val Fitch provided clear evidence in kaon decays that CP symmetry could be broken too, winning them the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1973, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa showed that CP violation in the weak interaction required {{more than two}} generations of particles, effectively predicting {{the existence of a}} then unknown third generation. This discovery earned them half of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics. Unlike parity violation, CP violation occurs in {{only a small number of}} instances, but remains widely held as an answer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the amount of matter and antimatter in the universe; it thus forms one of Andrei Sakharov's three conditions for baryogenesis.|$|E
5|$|Slaviša Jokanović left Watford {{at the end}} of his one-year {{contract}} after he, and the club, failed to reach new contractual agreements; he was replaced in June 2015 by the Spaniard Quique Sánchez Flores. Watford's first fixture in their return to the Premier League was a 2–2 draw with Everton. In the 2015–16 season, Watford reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup with a goal by midfielder Adlène Guedioura against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium, ending Arsenal's bid to win the competition for three successive times, and finished 13th in the Premier League, despite the club being, when the season began, a favorite among betting shops to be relegated. Sanchez was sacked in May 2016, a decision that Flores subsequently attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> how the owners and himself assessed Watford's ongoing season, and replaced by Italian coach Walter Mazzarri.|$|E

25|$|The policy's price {{controls}} and market interventions led to considerable overproduction. These were intervention stores of products bought {{up by the}} Community to maintain minimum price levels. To dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold {{on the world market}} at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the Community and world prices) to export their products outside the Community. This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside Europe, especially those in the developing world. Supporters of CAP argue that the economic support which it gives to farmers provides them with a reasonable standard of living.|$|E
25|$|In a south-pointing chariot, {{according}} to the hypothesis, Shaft B was connected to one road wheel and Shaft C was connected through a direction-reversing gear to the other road wheel. This made Shaft A rotate at a speed that was proportional <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the rotation speeds of the two wheels. The pointing doll was connected (possibly through intermediate gears) to Shaft A. When the chariot moved in a straight line, the two wheels turned at equal speeds, and the doll did not rotate. When the chariot turned, the wheels rotated at different speeds (for the same reason as in an automobile), so the differential caused the doll to rotate, compensating for the turning of the chariot.|$|E

25|$|The {{first law}} is usually {{formulated}} {{by saying that}} the change in the internal energy of a closed thermodynamic system is equal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the heat supplied to the system and the amount of work done by the system on its surroundings. It {{is important to note that}} internal energy is a state of the system (see Thermodynamic state) whereas heat and work modify the state of the system. In other words, a change of internal energy of a system may be achieved by any combination of heat and work added or removed from the system as long as those total to the change of internal energy. The manner by which a system achieves its internal energy is path independent.|$|E
25|$|Each array {{consists}} of four microphones and processing equipment. Analyzing the time delays between an acoustic wavefront's interaction with each microphone in the array UTAMS provides an azimuth of origin. The azimuth from each tower is reported to the UTAMS processor at the control station, and a POO is triangulated and displayed. The UTAMS subsystem can also detect and locate the point of impact (POI), but, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the speeds of sound and light, it may take UTAMS as long as 30 seconds to determine the POO for a rocket launch 13km away. This means UTAMS may detect a rocket POI prior to the POO, providing very little if any warning time. but the electro-optical component of RLS will detect the rocket POO earlier.|$|E
25|$|The {{meaning of}} the factor of (σ2/2)τ is {{relatively}} subtle. For dminus& and m this corresponds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the median and mean (respectively) of geometric Brownian motion (the log-normal distribution), and is the same correction factor in Itō's lemma for geometric Brownian motion. The interpretation of d+, as used in Delta, is subtler, and can be interpreted most elegantly as change of numéraire. In more elementary terms, {{the probability that the}} option expires in the money and the value of the underlying at exercise are not independent – the higher the price of the underlying, {{the more likely it is}} to expire in the money and the higher the value at exercise, hence why Delta is higher than moneyness.|$|E

25|$|Neurophysiological methods rely on {{utilizing}} information {{stemming from}} more direct {{and not necessarily}} conscious (pre-attentative) processes. Subjects are presented with speech stimuli in different types of tasks and {{the responses of the}} brain are measured. The brain itself can be more sensitive than it appears to be through behavioral responses. For example, the subject may not show sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> two speech sounds in a discrimination test, but brain responses may reveal sensitivity to these differences. Methods used to measure neural responses to speech include event-related potentials, magnetoencephalography, and near infrared spectroscopy. One important response used with event-related potentials is the mismatch negativity, which occurs when speech stimuli are acoustically different from a stimulus that the subject heard previously.|$|E
25|$|A {{phase locked}} loop is a {{feedback}} control system. It compares the phases of two input signals and produces an error signal that is proportional <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> their phases. The error signal is then low pass filtered and used to drive a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) which creates an output frequency. The output frequency is fed through a frequency divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output frequency drifts, the phase error signal will increase, driving the frequency {{in the opposite direction}} so as to reduce the error. Thus the output is locked to the frequency at the other input. This other input is called the reference and is usually derived from a crystal oscillator, which is very stable in frequency. The block diagram below shows the basic elements and arrangement of a PLL based frequency synthesizer.|$|E
