500|$|Although labor strife was muted {{after the}} {{settlement}} of the railway strike, it continued through Truman's presidency. The President's approval rating dropped from 82% in the polls in January 1946 to 52% by June. This dissatisfaction with the Truman administration's policies led to large Democratic losses in the 1946 midterm elections, when Republicans took control of Congress {{for the first time}} since 1930. The 80th Congress included Republican freshmen who would become prominent in the years to come, including Wisconsin Senator Joe McCarthy and California Congressman Richard Nixon. When Truman dropped to 32% in the polls, Democratic Arkansas Senator William Fulbright suggested that Truman resign; <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> did not care what Senator [...] "Halfbright" [...] said.|$|E

60|$|Whether {{he should}} {{complete}} the parallel, and skip, too, {{was a point}} which {{he had not yet}} acknowledged to himself that he had decided. He never had believed that it need come to that; but, for an instant, when <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> could wish him nothing better on his way home than a good railroad accident, it flashed upon him that one of the three alternatives before him was to skip. He had the choice to kill himself, which {{was supposed to be the}} gentlemanly way out of his difficulties, and would leave his family unstained by his crime; that matter had sometimes been discussed in his presence, and every one had agreed that it was the only thing for a gentleman to do after he had pilfered people of money he could not pay back. There was something else that a man of other instincts and weaker fibre might do, and that was to stand his trial for embezzlement, and take his punishment. Or a man, if he was that kind of a man, could skip. The question with Northwick was whether he was that kind of man, or whether, if he skipped, he would be that kind of man; whether the skipping would make him that kind of man.|$|E

And in reply to some expression of Mr. Hall as to his own opinion regarding slavery, he said he did not pretend to disguise his anti-slavery feeling; that he thought it was wrong, and should continue to think so; but that was not the question we had to deal with now. Slavery existed, and that, too, as well by the act of the North as of the South; and in any scheme to get rid of it the North as well as the South was morally bound to do its full and equal share. He thought the institution wrong and ought never to have existed; but yet he recognized the rights of property which had grown out of it, and would respect those rights as fully as similar rights in any other property; that property can exist and does legally exist. He thought such a law wrong, but the rights of property resulting must be respected; he would get rid of the odious law, not by violating the rights, but by encouraging the proposition and offering inducements to give it up.|$|E

40|$|Mixed quotes are quotes {{that appear}} to mix mention and use, or direct and {{indirect}} quotation, such as (1). (1) Quine says that quotation ‘has a certain anomalous feature. ’ (Davidson 1979) This paper argues that mixed quotation is a general phenomenon that pervades the interpretation of language. In fact, most of our speech consists of mixed quotes of ourselves and each other. Of course, because {{the vast majority of}} utterances do not call for quotation marks in print, this point is only plausible if we broaden the notion of mixed quotation to include many of them. My first order of business is thus to explain a broader notion of mixed quotation. I then use this notion to analyze naming and quantification. 1. The essence of mixed quotation Informally speaking, I take a mixed quote to mean what someone uses the quoted expression to mean (Geurts and Maier 2003). For example, (1) means that Quine says that quotation has the property that Quine uses ‘has a certain anomalous feature ’ to mean. The quoted expression need not be grammatical, as (2) shows. (2) <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> has an ‘ecelectic ’ reading list. (Maier 2007) This sentence means that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> has a reading list with the property that he uses ‘ecelectic ’ to mean. In a sense, mixed quotation internalizes the semantic interpretation function— the familiar double square brackets � � for denotation—and relativizes it to a speaker, be it Quine or the president. Of course, the use of a mixed quote often accomplishes far more than presupposing that someone uses the quoted expression to mean something and denoting that meaning. For example, the speakers of (2) and (3) can distanc...|$|E
