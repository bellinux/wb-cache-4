40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we aim at}} {{assessing}} the outcomes of the 2007 Italian reform of the complementary social security and to identify the determinants behind them. The reform gave relevant incentives to workers to switch from investing about 7 % of their gross wages into a compulsory defned benefit scheme inside the firm (which {{took the form of}} a <b>termination</b> <b>indemnity</b> payment, the TFR scheme) to an external pension fund. We provide a theoretical framework to model workers' choice problem of switching between these pension schemes and we then perform an agent-based simulation taking into account all the details of the reform. Our simulations are able to replicate the Italian data in term of adhesion rates to complementary social security and also to identify some of the key determinants of that outcome, like the fiscal incentives, the financial literacy and the expectations on the rate of returns of pension funds. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we aim at}} {{assessing}} the outcomes of the 2007 Italian reform of the complementary social security scheme and at identifying the determinants behind them. The reform provided workers with relevant incentives to switch the investment of about 7 per cent of their gross yearly wages from a firm-managed scheme (which {{took the form of}} a <b>termination</b> <b>indemnity</b> payment, the Trattamento di Fine Rapporto scheme) to an external pension fund. We provide a theoretical framework to model the workers’ problem of choosing between these two different forms of complementary social security schemes and we then perform an agent-based simulation taking into account all the details of the reform. Differently from previous contributions, we stress the impact that the investment decision has on the financial health of firms and, consequently, on workers’ employment stability. Our simulations are able to replicate the Italian data in terms of adhesion rates to complementary social security and also to identify some of the key determinants of that outcome, such as fiscal incentives, individual preferences, the working of both the Italian labour and the financial markets and the productive structure of the Italian economy...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{transportation}} mode of tank truck in carrying BBM (fuel oil) to industrial location is highly {{needed for the}} sake of consumers and equal distribution. In Dumai and Siak which are very wide, PT Pertamina (Persero) needs several agents in distributing fuel oil in order to expedite fuel oil delivery. Since PT MitraWahyuPrakasa had won the tender for collaborating with PT Pertamina (Persero), the collaboration between the two parties was established. In order to find out the content of the contract, it was necessary to analyze the cooperative agreement between the two parties. The conclusion of the research was that the contract on BBM mode transportation of tank trucks was not made in authentic deed. Here, PT Pertamina (Persero) wanted only one contract for many transportation companies in many areas quickly in order to save money, time, and energy. Therefore, the contract between the two parties was made by PT Pertamina (Persero) Region 1, Medan in a standard contract. The problem was that there was no balance between the right and the obligation since PT Pertamina (Persero) was more dominant than PT MitraWahyuPrakasa. The legal consequence was that when one of the parties breached of contract (default), there would the sanctions of warning, suspension, <b>indemnity,</b> <b>termination</b> of cooperative relationship from PT Pertamina (Persero), and criminal sanction. The consequence of force majeure was that here would be no responsibility for the failure and/or the lateness in carrying out the duties...|$|R
40|$| risk {{model for}} funding {{severance}} payment liabilities is formulated and studied. The yearly aggregate {{lump sum payments}} are supposed to follow a classical collective model of risk theory with compound distributions. The final wealth at an arbitrary time is described explicitly including formulas for the mean and the variance. Annual initial level premiums required for “dismissal funding” are determined and useful gamma approximations for confidence intervals of the wealth are proposed. A specific numerical example illustrates the non-negligible probability of a bankruptcy in case the employee structure of a “dismissal plan” is not well balanced. Chapter 13 starts {{from the fact that}} retirement is being remade owing to the confluence of demographic, economic, and policy factors. The authors empirically investigate major influences on the retirement behavior of older U. S. workers from 1992 through 2004 using survey data from the Health and Retirement Study. Their analysis builds on the large empirical literature on retirement, in particular, by examining how market booms and busts affect the likelihood and timing of retirement, an issue that will be of growing importance given the ongoing shift from traditional DB pensions to 401 (k) s. They comprehensively model all major sources of health insurance coverage and identify their varying impacts, and also reveal the significant policy-driven retirement differences across cohorts that are attributable to the changes in social security full-retirement age. These fundamental retirement changes need {{to be taken into account}} when we design corporate and public retirement programs. Chapter 14 deals with a study on occupational pension insurance for Germany—a country where Pillar II pension schemes are (still) widely based on a book reserve system. The insurance of occupational pension schemes is provided for by the Pensions-Sicherungs-Verein Versicherungsverein auf Gegenseitigkeit (PSVaG), which is the German counterpart to the U. S. PBGC. Th is study investigates potential adverse selection and moral hazard problems originating from the introduction of reduced premiums for funded pensions and assesses whether the risk-adjusted risk premiums, as introduced by the U. K. Pension Protection Fund, can be a means to mitigate these problems. Chapter 15 describes the longevity risk securitization in pension schemes, focusing mainly on longevity bonds and survivor swaps. The authors analyze the evaluation of these mortality-linked securities in an incomplete market using a risk-neutral pricing approach. A Poisson Lee– Carter model is adopted to represent the mortality trend. The chapter concludes with an empirical application on Italian annuity market data. In Part III, Chapter 16 highlights that the international trend toward adopting a “fair value” approach to pension accounting has transpired the risks involved in promises of DB pensions. The hunt is on for ways to remove or limit the employers’ risk exposures to financial statements volatility. Th is chapter examines the U. K. firms’ risk management of their pension fund asset allocation over a period when the new U. K. pension GAAP (FRS 17) became effective. The findings suggest that firms manage their pension risk exposure in order to minimize cash contribution risks associated with the adoption of “fair value”–based pension accounting rules, consistent with a risk off setting explanation. Chapter 17 develops and tests a theory of competition among pressure groups over political influence in the context of confl icting U. K. standards concerning the factors affecting the recent development of pension fund accountability rules. The chapter models both sources of pressure affecting the accountability relationship as well as how those factors combined to influence U. K. pension fund managers’ discretion over the adoption and retention of disclosure regulations. The author finds that auditors and pension management groups exerted most political pressure, which translated to political influence during the extended adoption period. The findings are mostly consistent with a capture or private interest perspective on pension accounting regulation. Chapter 18 reviews three useful instruments—notional defined-contribution accounts (NDCs), the actuarial balance (AB), and automatic balance mechanisms (ABMs) —derived from actuarial analysis methodology that can be applied to the public management of PAYGO systems to improve their fairness, transparency, and solvency. The authors suggest that these tools are not simply theoretical concepts but, in some countries, an already legislated response to the growing social demand for transparency in the area of public finance management as well as the desire to set the pension system firmly on the road to long-term financial solvency. In Chapter 19, the authors review the risk-based solvency regime for pension funds in the Netherlands. The supervision of pension funds aims to ensure that institutions are always able to meet their commitments to the beneficiaries. In addition, the pension fund must be legally separated from the employer offering the pension arrangement. Furthermore, the marked-to-market value of the assets must be at least equal to the marked-to-market value of the liabilities at all times (full funding prerequisite). Risk-based solvency requirements are intended as a buffer to absorb the risks from unexpected changes in the value of assets and liabilities. Finally, a key element of the Dutch regulatory approach is the continuity analysis for assessing the pension fund’s solvency in the long run. In Chapter 20, the author addresses the fact that the global financial crisis of 2008 highlighted the importance of shielding pension participants from market volatility. Th is policy concern is of general relevance due to the global shift from DB to DC as main mechanisms for financing retirement income. Policy options being debated in the aft ermath of the crisis include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: (1) the introduction of lifetime minimum return guarantees, (2) the review of default investment options, and (3) the outright reversal to PAYGO earning–related pensions. Th is chapter reviews the performance during the crisis of countries that already rely on mandatory DC plans. The author suggests that important welfare gains can be achieved by requiring the introduction of liability-driven default investment products based on a modified version of the target date funds commonly available in the retail industry for retirement wealth. Such products would reconnect the accumulation with the decumulation phase, improve the hedging of annuitization risk, but avoid the introduction of liabilities for plan managers. In Part IV, Chapter 21 highlights the DB pension freezes in large healthy firms such as Verizon and IBM, as well as terminations of plans in the struggling steel and airline industries that cannot be viewed as riskfree from the employee’s perspective. The authors develop an empirical dynamic programming framework to investigate household saving decisions in a simple life cycle model with DB pensions subject to the risk of being frozen. The model incorporates important sources of uncertainty facing households, including asset returns, employment, wages, and mortality, as well as pension freezes. Chapter 22 is referred to as the Italian experience. In Italy, social security contributions of Italian employees finance a two-pillar system: public and private pensions that are both calculated in a DC scheme (funded for the private pension and unfunded for the public one). In addition to this, a large number of workers have also <b>termination</b> <b>indemnities</b> at the end of their active service. The authors aim to answer the following questions. Are the different flows of contributions coherent with the aim of minimizing the pension risk of the workers? Given the actual percentages of contributions, is the asset allocation of private pension funds optimal? What percentages would optimize the pension risk management of the workers (considering public pension, private pension, and <b>termination</b> <b>indemnities)</b> ? Chapter 24 examines the Greek experience in limiting the opportunity of investments of pension funds in foreign assets. In fact, suffering from inefficient funding, the current imbalance of the Greek social security system, to some extent, was the result of the restrictive investment constraints in the period 1958 – 2000 that directed reserves to low-yielding deposits with the Bank of Greece with little or no exposure to market yields or the stock market. As shown in the 43 year analysis, these investment restrictions incurred a significant economic opportunity loss both in terms of inferior returns as well as lower risks. Chapter 25 examines the effect of a company’s unfunded pension liabilities on its stock market valuation. Using a sample of UK FTSE 350 firms with DB pension schemes, the authors find that although unfunded pension liabilities reduce the market value of the firm, the coefficient estimates indicate a less than one-for-one effect. Moreover, there is no evidence of significantly negative subsequent abnormal returns for highly underfunded schemes. These results suggest that shareholders do take into consideration the unfunded pension liabilities when valuing the firm, but do not fully incorporate all available information. Chapter 26 focuses on the selection of an appropriate style model to explain the returns of Spanish balanced pension plans as well as on the analysis of the relevance of these strategic allocations on portfolio performance. Results suggest similar findings than those obtained in previous studies, providing evidence that asset allocations explains about 90...|$|R
