The immunosuppressive effect of the virus on <b>thymus</b> cells, <b>independent</b> of any contribution by cells of bone marrow origin, was verified with thymus-independent immunogens, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or pneumococcal polysaccharide SIII (PPS).

When stimulated with suboptimal concentrations of ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), the immature subpopulation of Lyt 2 -,L 3 T 4 - (2 - 4 -) thymocytes responded to exogenous, purified IL- 1 in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, mature lymph node (LN) T cells were unresponsive to exogenous IL- 1 under similar conditions. The proliferation of 2 - 4 - thymocytes, which comprise 2 - 3 % of {{cells in the}} adult mouse <b>thymus,</b> was <b>independent</b> of exogenous IL- 2 and accounted for essentially all the 3 H-thymidine incorporation by unfractionated thymocytes in response to IL- 1. Optimally stimulated 2 - 4 - cells did not show responsiveness to exogenous IL- 1, and 48 h supernatants from these cultures were found to contain IL- 1 like activity.

40|$|The {{antibody}} {{response to}} the dinitrophenyl (DNP) hapten was studied in mice depleted of T cells. It was found that 'nude' mise or neonatally thymectomized mice which had also been injected with antilymphocyte serum responded after the injection of DNP conjugated to the <b>thymus</b> <b>independent</b> carrier, Salmonella flagella (DNP Fla), but not the thymus dependent carrier, fowl γ globulin. The IM primary response was completely normal, but the IgG response was about 1 / 5 - 1 / 3 of normal. The IgM secondary response was normal but the IgG response was minimal. The results indicate that in the CBA/HWehi strain, and in non inbred nude mice IgM production to DNP Fla is a <b>thymus</b> <b>independent</b> process, {{in the sense that}} the magnitude of the response does not depend on T cells. The IgG response to DNP Fla, while present, was reduced, and may thus be partly thymus dependent. The results were interpreted in the light of current knowledge of the mechanism of T/Blymphocyte cooperation, which involves two factors, a specific factor which is a complex of IgT and antigen, which acts indirectly on B cells first binding to macrophages, forming a matrix of antigen, and a non specific factor which acts directly on B cells. It is speculated that the relative lack of IgG in the absence of T cells may be partly due to a deficiency in the non specific factor. Furthermore, the diminished persistence of antigen which has been reported by Mitchell et al. in nude mice, as compared with their litter mates, whould also influence the later IgG response relatively more than the earlier IgM response...|$|E
40|$|Polymyxin B, {{which is}} a basic {{polypeptide}} produced by various strains of Bacillus Polymyxa, has previously been shown to prevent the lethal effect of LPS and to neutralize the Schwartzmann reaction. In this study we have investigated the interactions between polymyxin B and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and hapten LPS conjugates. Polymyxin B was found to suppress mitogenicity of LPS and also to inhibit immunogenicity of the hapten conjugate 4 -hydroxy- 3, 5 -dinitrophenacetyl (NNP) -LPS. Inhibition was not due to interference with the expression of NNP determinants nor to cross-reactivity between PB and the hapten.

40|$|A pool of {{immature}} T {{cells with}} a seemingly unrestricted repertoire of antigen specificities is generated life-long in the thymus. Amongst these cells are, however, thymocytes that express a strongly self-reactive antigen receptor and hence hold {{the potential to}} trigger autoimmunity. To prevent such an outcome, the <b>thymus</b> employs several <b>independent</b> but functionally related strategies that act in parallel to enforce self-tolerance. The deletion of strongly self-reactive thymocytes and the generation of regulatory T cells constitute the two most efficient mechanisms to induce and maintain immunological tolerance.

40|$|Newborn mice do not, in general, produce {{antibodies}} {{during the}} 1 st week of life; this inability to respond immunologically has {{been attributed to}} lack of functional macrophages and T cells. To determine whether B cells of newborn mice are functionally mature and therefore capable of producing antibodies to <b>thymus</b> (T) <b>independent</b> antigens, the response of 1 - 9 -day-old C 3 H/HeJ mice injected with a thymus-independent polypeptide, poly(DTyr,DGlu) -polyDPro- -polyDLys was compared to that of their littermates injected with a thymus-dependent immunogen, poly(LTyr,LGlu) -polyLPro- -polyLLys. No antibodies were detected in 1 - or 2 -day-old mice immunized with the T-dependent antigen, as revealed by haemagglutination and haemolytic plaque-forming cell assays, performed 6 days after injection of the antigen. Injection of 3 -day-old animals with the thymus-dependent immunogen resulted in significant immune responses which increased with age. In contrast, 1 - and 2 -day-old mice responded to the T-independent immunogen with high antibody levels, however, in 3 -day-old injected mice, the levels were lower. When 3 -day-old nude mice were injected with this antigen, no decrease in the immune response was observed. Thus, newborn mice respond immunologically to a thymus-independent antigen injected at the first 2 days after birth and the antibody levels decrease with maturation of the thymus...|$|R

40|$|Natural killer (NK) T {{lymphocytes}} {{are thought}} to act as regulatory cells directing early events during immune responses. Murine NKT cells express inhibitory receptors of the Ly 49 family. These receptors have a well-established and crucial role in modulating NK cell activities, but their physiological role in regulating NKT cells is not well understood, nor is the influence of major histocompatibility (MHC) ligands on endogenous Ly 49 expression. We have further investigated how the expression of inhibitory NK receptors is regulated on NKT cells, and demonstrate a non-random expression of ligated Ly 49 molecules on CD 1 d-restricted NKT cells. The nature of the T-cell receptor on the NKT cell crucially determines the profile of expressed Ly 49 isoforms. Further, we show that MHC class I ligands efficiently modulate the expression levels of the inhibitory receptors, and the frequencies of cells positive for the Ly 49 members. In addition, we find a several-fold increase in Ly 49 C/I-expressing NKT cells in adult <b>thymus,</b> apparently <b>independent</b> of MHC class I molecules. Abundant expression of Ly 49 receptors on NKT cells, and the striking differences found in Ly 49 isoform patterns on NKT-cell subsets differing in T-cell receptor expression, suggest that the pattern of Ly 49 expression is tuned to fit the T-cell receptor and to emphasize further a role for these receptors in NKT immunity...|$|R

In contrast eight month thymectomy produced an elevated secondary antibody response toA. salmonicida. This again was partly returned to control levels by reconstitution with the fish's autogenic cryopreserved thymocytes one week prior to secondary immunisation.

Splenic DN tg T cells responded to anti-CD 3 stimulation similarly to CD 41 cells, but proliferative and cytokine responses to PLP 139 – 151 were blunted, implying that CD 4 coreceptor down-regulation modulated T cell responses to the self-antigen in vitro. Adoptive transfer of tg DN CD 3 hi cells into RAG-deficient wild-type (WT) recipients induced EAE less efficiently than transfer of CD 41 T tg cells indicating the blunted responses of DN tg T cells to self-antigen in vivo. The frequency of tg DN T cells was irrespective of thymic expression of the autoantigen. These data implicate that down-regulation of CD 4 co-receptor in the <b>thymus,</b> which is <b>independent</b> from the expression of thymic autoantigen, results in a blunted response to the autoantigen in the periphery and limits the incidence of spontaneous autoimmunity in genetically resistant mice bearing a large autoreactive tg T cell repertoire...|$|R

Aside from the surface immunoglobulin (sIg), 1 which has been demonstrated on a proportion of lymphoid cells (1, 2), some antigenic determinants of the cell membranes appear to be specifically related to the pathway of differentiation followed by the cells which bear them. These "differentiation antigens " (3) can thus be used to recognize, among lymphocytes, those which are derived from the thymus, or T lymphocytes, and those which are <b>thymus</b> <b>independent,</b> or B lympbocytes. In the mouse, alloantisera raised against the 0 antigen {{have been widely used}} for the recognition of T lymphocytes (4). Heteroantisera can also be obtained by immunmation of other species with mouse thymocytes (5) or brain (6); after appropriate absorption on mouse tissues, in vivo (5) or in vitro (6), these antisera recognize antigenic determinants which appear to be present only on T lymphocytes and which have been called "mouse-specific lymphocyte antigens," MSLA (5), brain-associated 0 antigen, BAe (6). It is also possible to obtain, by immunization with mouse lymphoid cells depleted in T cells, heteroantisera which afte...|$|E
40|$|During {{ontogeny}} IgD appears {{later than}} IgM on splenocytes of neonatal mice (1) {{and at a}} time when mice develop a markedly increased immune responsiveness (2). Based on these observations, it was suggested that IgD serves as a ~triggering " isotype for induction of immune responses, whereas surface IgM functions as a tolerizing receptor (3). To test this hypothesis, the susceptibility of adult splenocytes (which are predominantly p~+ 8 + [4 - 6]) and neonatal splenocytes (which bear predominantly IgM [/zp+; 1, 4 - 6]) to tolerance induction were compared. The results indicate that neonatal splenic B cells responsive to thymus dependent (TD) antigens are exquisitely susceptible to tolerance induction compared with those from adult mice (7 - 9). However, cells from both adult and neonatal mice were highly susceptible to tolerance induction when <b>thymus</b> <b>independent</b> (TI) antigen was used as immunogen (8). These results suggest that the major precursor for the TD response is a tL+ 8 +-cell which appears late in ontogeny and is resistant to tolerance induction and that the tLp+-cell is the major precursor for the TI response and is highly susceptible to toleranc...|$|E
40|$|Immunization with Neisseria meningitidis group B capsular {{polysaccharide}} (CpsB) elicited responses in adult mice {{that showed the}} typical dynamic characteristics of the response to a thymus-independent antigen, {{in contrast to the}} thymus-dependent behavior of antibody responses to CpsC. The former had a short latent period and showed a rapid increase in serum antibodies that peaked at day 5, and immunoglobulin M (IgM) was the major isotype even though IgG (mainly IgG 2 a and IgG 2 b) was also detectable. This response was of short duration, and the specific antibodies were rapidly cleared from the circulation. The secondary responses were similar in magnitude, kinetics, IgM predominance, and IgG distribution. Nevertheless, a threefold IgG increase, a correlation between IgM and IgG levels, and dose-dependent secondary responses were observed. Hyperimmunization considerably reinforced these responses: 10 -fold for IgM and 300 -fold for IgG. This favored isotype switch was accompanied by a progressive change in the subclass distribution to IgG 3 (62 %) and IgG 1 (28 %), along with the possible generation of B-cell memory. The results indicate that CpsB is being strictly <b>thymus</b> <b>independent</b> and suggest that unresponsiveness to purified CpsB is due to tolerance...|$|E
