50|$|Mg2+ is transported into cells {{containing}} {{only the}} CorA transport system with similar kinetics and cation sensitivities as the Mg2+ uptake {{described in the}} earlier papers, and has additionally been quantified(see table). The uptake of Mg2+ was seen to plateau as in earlier studies, and although no actual mechanism for the decrease in transport has been determined, so it has been assumed that the protein is inactivated. Co2+ and Ni2+ are toxic to S. typhimurium cells containing a functional CorA protein and this toxicity stems from the blocking of Mg2+ uptake (competitive inhibition) and the accumulation of these ions inside the cell. Co2+ and Ni2+ {{have been shown to}} be transported by CorA by using radioactive <b>tracer</b> <b>analysis,</b> although with lower affinities (km) and velocities (Vmax) than for Mg2+ (see table). The km values for Co2+ and Ni2+ are significantly above those expected to be encountered by the cells in their normal environment, so it is unlikely that the CorA transport system mediates the uptake of these ions under natural conditions. To date, the evidence for Mn2+ transport by CorA is limited to E. coli.|$|E

The distributions and abundances of biomarkers such as straight chain homologous series (e. g., n-alkanes, n-alkanoic acids, n-alkan- 2 -ones, n-alkanols, etc.) and cyclic terpenoid compounds (e. g., sesquiterpenoids, diterpenoids, steroids, triterpenoids) were identified in epicuticular waxes from conifers of western North America (natural emissions). These biomarkers and their thermal alteration derivatives were also identified in smoke emissions from known vegetation sources (e. g., conifers, deciduous trees and grasses) and were then applied as tracers in soils, soils that contained wildfire residues and soil/river mud washout after wildfire burning. Where possible, the reaction pathways of transformation from the parent precursor compounds to intermediate and final alteration products were determined from GC-MS data.

40|$|Nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) {{has become an}} indispensable tool in petroleum industry for formation evaluation. This dissertation addresses two problems. • We aim at developing a theory {{to better understand the}} phenomena of transverse relaxation in the presence of internal field gradients. • Chracterizing the pore structure of vuggy carbonates. We have developed a two dimensional model to study a system of claylined pore. We have identified three distinct relaxation regimes. The interplay of three time parameters characterize the transverse relaxation in three different regimes. In future work, useful geometric information can be extracted from from SEM images and the pore size distribution analysis of North Burbank sandstone to simulate transverse relaxation using our 2 -D clay flake model and study diffusional coupling in the presence of internal field gradients. Carbonates reservoirs exhibit complex pore structure with micropores and macropores/vugs. Vuggy pore space can be divided into separate-vugs and touching-vugs, depending on vug interconnection. Separate vugs are connected only through interparticle pore networks and do not contribute to permeability. Touching vugs are independent of rock fabric and form an interconnected pore system enhancing the permeability. Accurate characterization of pore structure of carbonate reservoirs is essential for design and implementation of enhanced oil recovery processes. However, characterizing pore structure in carbonates is a complex task due to the diverse variety of pore types seen in carbonates and extreme pore level heterogeneity. The carbonate samples which are focus of this study are very heterogeneous in pore structures. Some of the sample rocks are breccia and other samples are fractured. In order to characterize the pore size in vuggy carbonates, we use NMR along with <b>tracer</b> <b>analysis.</b> The distribution of porosity between micro and macro-porosity can be measured by NMR. However, NMR cannot predict if different sized vugs are connected or isolated. <b>Tracer</b> <b>analysis</b> is used to characterize the connectivity of the vug system and matrix. Modified version of differential capacitance model of Coats and Smith (1964) and a solution procedure developed by Baker (1975) is used to study dispersion and capacitance effects in core-samples. The model has three dimensionless groups: 1) flowing fraction (f), 2) dimensionless group for mass transfer (NM) characterizing the mass transfer between flowing and stagnant phase and 3) dimensionless group for dispersion (NK) characterizing the extent of dispersion. In order to obtain unique set of model parameters from experimental data, we have developed an algorithm which uses effluent concentration data at two different flow rates to obtain the fitted parameter for both cases simultaneously. <b>Tracer</b> <b>analysis</b> gives valuable insight on fraction of dead-end pores and dispersion and mass transfer effects at core scale.
