5|$|For Register of Wills, as for City Controller, the Republicans had {{a primary}} fight between the Hamilton-Meade regulars and the Meehan faction. As in that contest, the regulars were victorious, nominating Robert C. Duffy, {{attorney}} and former football star, with 67,283 votes. In second came Meehan's man, Morris J. Root, with 42,977, and William P. Shermer, an independent candidate, with 8,909. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> {{an easier time}} nominating former Congressman Francis R. Smith, who trounced Joseph F. Amodie, 40,582 to 5,470. The general election contest {{was one of the}} closest on the ballot but the Republican, Duffy, still defeated the Democrat by more than 7,500 votes.|$|E
5|$|On January 31, The Post-Star {{reported}} that <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> narrowed {{the field of}} potential candidates from over two dozen applicants down to six. The Democratic chairpersons met with all six candidates at a diner in Albany on February 1, and selected Scott Murphy of Glens Falls, president of the Upstate Venture Association of New York, as their candidate. Other confirmed candidates included Saratoga County Democratic Chairman Larry Bulman, former New York Rangers goaltender Mike Richter, Coxsackie Town Supervisor Alex Betke, and Tracey Brooks, failed candidate for the nomination for the 21st district election in 2008.|$|E
5|$|On September 7, 1874, the new {{constitution}} was completed and signed {{by a majority of}} delegates. The entire electorate, including the disenfranchised Confederates and the Freedmen, voted. The election not only was for ratification of the {{new constitution}} but also for state officials that would be elected if the constitution was indeed ratified. The Republicans actually took the same position that <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> taken earlier, believing that the election was illegal they nominated no candidates. Conservative Democrats and allied paramilitary groups suppressed black voting, using a combination of intimidation, blocking blacks from the polls, and outright assassinations. The new constitution was ratified on October 13, 1874 and Democratic officials elected almost unanimously, including new Democratic Governor Augustus H. Garland who was inaugurated November 12, 1874, and Baxter left office after only serving two years of a four-year term.|$|E

5|$|Sihanouk, who by now had {{tired of}} the {{political}} squabbling, dissolved the assembly in September 1949, but opted to rule by decree {{for the next two}} years before general elections were held, which the Democrats won. In October 1951 Thanh returned to Cambodia and was received by 100,000 supporters, a spectacle which Sihanouk saw as an affront to his regal authority. Thanh disappeared six months later, presumably to join the Khmer Issarak. Sihanouk ordered the Democrat-led government to arrest Thanh but was ignored. Subsequently, civil demonstrations rallying against the monarchy and the French broke out in the countryside, alarming Sihanouk, who began to suspect that <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> played a complicit role in them. In June 1952 Sihanouk dismissed the Democrat nominee Huy Kanthoul and made himself prime minister. A few days later, Sihanouk privately confided in exasperation to the US chargé d'affaires, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, that parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for Cambodia.|$|E

25|$|Although studies {{indicate}} Democrats {{tend to be}} more supportive of a single-payer system than Republicans, none of the reform bills debated in the U.S. Congress when <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> a majority from 2007–2010, included proposals to implement a single payer health care system. Advocates argue that the largest obstacle to single-payer, universal system in the U.S. is a lack of political will.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} of the Democratic {{campaign}} was to set up clubs to organize its members; the more militant Democrats were organized into the rifle clubs whereas the red shirt clubs were arranged to intimidate black voters through violence and intimidation.

25|$|In 1835, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> {{lost the}} {{governorship}} of Tennessee {{for the first}} time in the party's history, and Polk decided to return home to help the party. In the 1839 Tennessee gubernatorial election, Polk defeated two-term incumbent Whig Newton Cannon by an estimated 2,500 of 105,000 total votes. Polk and Jackson hoped the former's election would serve as a springboard to the vice presidential nomination in 1840 and the presidency in 1844, but the 1840 Democratic National Convention split among Polk and incumbent Richard Mentor Johnson and failed to nominate anyone for the position.|$|E

The Democrat Party lost further ground to Thai Rak Thai in the 2005 general election. In the election campaign, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> a populist platform, promoting job creation, universal {{education and health}} care, and law and order against crime and corruption. The party aimed to gain 201 seats, enough to launch a vote of a no confidence debate against the premier. They won 96 out of 500 seats and 18.3% of the popular vote. The party's leader, Banyat Bantadtan, resigned after the election.|$|E
25|$|In Western Australia, the Greens' Rachel Siewert {{was elected}} to the final vacancy after the final Labor {{candidate}} was excluded. This was a gain for the Greens {{at the expense of the}} Democrats Brian Greig. While <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> done a preference swap with Family First, the deal in Western Australia did not include the Christian Democrats. As a result, when the Australian Democrats were excluded from the count, their preferences flowed to the Greens, putting them on track for the final vacancy. The end result was one Green, three Liberal and two Labor Senators elected in Western Australia.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent {{elections}} saw military-backed parties {{winning the}} majority in the House; however the Senate was still dominated by Democrats and other royalists. As Marshal Plaek was still Premier, tensions between the military and the Democrat/palace-alliance steadily increased. On November 29, 1951, the military and the police seized power, just as King Bhumibol's ship was returning to Thai waters. Although the military's 1952 constitution, which was similar to the 1932 Constitution, called for elections, <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> been practically barred from government for the following 23 years for their anti-military stance, denying them chances to serve the people.|$|E

25|$|In the 1984 presidential {{election}} <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> nominated Walter Mondale, a traditional New Deal-type liberal as their candidate. When Mondale {{was defeated in}} a landslide, party leaders became eager {{to find a new}} approach {{to get away from the}} 1980 and 1984 debacles. After Bush's image was affected by his involvement on the Iran-Contra scandal much more than Reagan's, and after the Democrats won back control of the U.S. Senate in the 1986 congressional elections following an economic downturn, the party's leaders felt more optimistic about having a closer race with the GOP in 1988, although probabilities from winning the presidency were still marginal with the contemporary climate of prosperity.|$|E
25|$|As the 1894 mid-term {{elections}} neared, Republicans {{were able}} to secure blame for the poor economic situation on the Democrats, and swept into power in the statehouse, taking strong majorities in both houses. The legislative districts created in 1890 were a subject of intense debate at the time; the legislature during the term of Governor Isaac P. Gray had created several gerrymander districts that favored Democrats. Republicans had contested the districting in the courts, who ruled the state must be redistricted. <b>The</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> done so in 1893, but the Republicans overrode their redistricting upon taking power, and created their own plan which effectively reversed the situation and created pro-Republican gerrymander districts.|$|E
25|$|At the Republican state {{convention}} in Lexington, held May 23, 1883, Morrow {{was chosen as}} the Republican nominee for governor of Kentucky. His opponent was popular six-term congressman J. Proctor Knott. Morrow charged that <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had,</b> {{since the end of the}} Civil War, squandered the state's money and accomplished little. He cited as evidence that in 1865, the state's debt was $6 million and the state sinking fund contained $9 million in resources, but by 1883, the sinking fund was exhausted with the state debt still standing at $400,000. He also attacked outgoing Democratic governor Luke P. Blackburn for his liberal use of executive clemency. Morrow was no match for Knott's oratory nor the scathing press of Louisville Courier-Journal editor Henry Watterson. Knott won the election by a vote of 133,615 to 89,181.|$|E

25|$|President Harry S. Truman {{vetoed the}} Act, but enough Democrats {{joined with the}} Republicans to {{override}} the Presidential veto on June 23, 1947. It is in the platform of all major U.S. labor unions to call for {{the repeal of the}} Act, especially Section 14 (b), and at times this has been reflected in the platform of the Democratic Party. However, the only time this has ever seemed likely was when <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> a huge majority in both houses of Congress following the Republican electoral disaster of 1964. Even then, the repeal bill passed 221–203 in the House, but the two-thirds majority it needed in the Senate was never attained, partly because of long filibustering by Republicans such as Minority leader Everett Dirksen. Labor allies failed to break the filibuster, and the repeal bill was finally put to rest by the Montana Democrat Majority leader, Mike Mansfield, on February 10, 1966.|$|E
25|$|In South Australia, the Australian Democrats {{negotiated}} a crucial preference swap with Family First that prevented the Greens winning the final vacancy. If <b>the</b> <b>Democrats</b> <b>had</b> polled better, {{they would have}} collected Family First and Liberal preferences and won the final vacancy. Former Democrat Leader Meg Lees also contested the Senate in South Australia, but was eliminated late in the count. However, Lees did have some impact on the outcome, as there were large numbers of below the line preferences for both the Progressive Alliance (as well as One Nation) which were widely spread rather than flowing to the Democrats. When the Democrats were excluded, preferences flowed to Family First which prevented the Greens' Brian Noone passing the third Labor candidate. This resulted in a seat that could otherwise have been won by the Greens instead being won by Labor on Green preferences. The flow of One Nation preferences to Labor {{made it impossible for}} either Family First or the Liberal Party to win the final vacancy. Labor's Dana Wortley was elected to the final vacancy. The end result in South Australia was split 3 Liberal, 3 Labor.|$|E
