Engineers know that the output must satisfy the requirements, must comply with the production and market rules, and must be competitive. Professionals in the new field of software engineering started a few years ago to define metrics to appraise their product: individual programs and software systems. This concern motivates the need to assess not only the outcome but also the process and tools employed in its development. In this context, assessing the quality of programming languages is a legitimate objective; in a similar way, it makes sense to be concerned with models and modeling approaches, as more and more people start the software development process by a modeling phase. In this paper we introduce and motivate the assessment of models quality in the Software Development cycle.

A detailed finite element model of high speed orthogonal cutting of titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V is developed. Several mechanics models of cutting process, such as material constitutive model, chip separation model and chip damage model, are implemented to improve finite element simulation accuracy. The chip shape and cutting force agree well with experimental results, which show the finite element model developed in this study is reasonable. Using this finite element model, chip formation process of titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V is simulated.

The resulting polymer microelements combine optical or biological functionalities with designed mechanical properties. Two applications are chosen for illustration of this concept: As a first example, microelements for optical communication via fiber-to-fiber coupling are manufactured by combining two molds {{to a small}} mold insert. Both molds are fabricated using lithography and electroplating. As a second example, microcantilevers (μCs) for chemical sensing are surface patterned using a modular mold composed of a laser-machined cavity defining the geometry of the μCs, and an opposite flat <b>tool</b> <b>side</b> which is covered by a patterned polymer foil. Injection molding results {{in an array of}} 35 [*]μm-thick μCs with microscale surface topographies.

Cyclic degradation of solder/IMC interface properties, namely penalty stiffness, strengths and critical energy release rates follows power-law functions of fatigue cycles. Performance of the extended CZM is examined using finite element (FE) simulation of a single Sn- 4 Ag- 0. 5 Cu (SAC 405) solder interconnect specimen. Strain rate-dependent response of the solder is represented by unified inelastic strain equations (Anand's model) with optimized model parameters for SAC 405 solders. The 3 D FE model of the specimen is subjected to cyclic relative displacement (Δδ = 0. 003 mm, R = 0) so as to induce shear-dominant fatigue loading.

40|$|SummaryTool use, though rare, is taxonomically widespread, but {{morphological}} adaptations for tool use {{are virtually}} unknown [1]. We {{focus on the}} New Caledonian crow (NCC, Corvus moneduloides), which displays {{some of the most}} innovative tool-related behavior among nonhumans [2 – 6]. One of their major food sources is larvae extracted from burrows with sticks held diagonally [7] in the bill, oriented with individual, but not species-wide, laterality [8, 9]. Among possible behavioral [10] and anatomical adaptations for tool use [5, 11 – 15], NCCs possess unusually wide binocular visual fields (up to 60 °), suggesting that extreme binocular vision may facilitate tool use [5]. Here, we establish that during natural extractions, tool tips can only be viewed by the contralateral eye. Thus, maintaining binocular view of tool tips is unlikely to have selected for wide binocular fields; the selective factor is {{more likely to have been}} to allow each eye to see far enough across the midsagittal line to view the tool’s tip monocularly [5, 16]. Consequently, we tested the hypothesis that <b>tool</b> <b>side</b> preference follows eye preference and found that eye dominance does predict tool laterality across individuals. This contrasts with humans’ species-wide motor laterality and uncorrelated motor-visual laterality [17], possibly because bill-held tools are viewed monocularly and move in concert with eyes, whereas hand-held tools are visible to both eyes and allow independent combinations of eye preference and handedness. This difference may affect other models of coordination between vision and mechanical control, not necessarily involving tools...|$|E

The paper describes the development of a highly dynamic milling machine which is equipped with linear direct drives in all axes with integrated impulse decoupling units to allow high dynamics and especially high jerks at low impact on the machine structure. To provide the same dynamics of 1. 5 g in all three axes the z-axis is mounted separately on the <b>tool</b> <b>side.</b> Passive magnetic actors are integrated in the z-axis as weight compensation to supply the same acceleration in positive and negative z-direction.

This design provides better process conditions and will speed up the machining time approximately about 20 percent, at less tool wear and better surface qualities. The dimensions of the machine base are 800 mm x 800 mm and the total machine uses about 1 m(exp 2) floor space including periphery.

40|$|International audiencePrediction of the {{tribological}} parameters {{controlling the}} tool wear {{is one of}} the most complex research axes in the metal cutting literature. The nature of the friction on the tool-chip interface is the main process which influences the distribution of stresses and temperatures which in turn activates the thermomechanical process governing tool wear. Under extreme conditions of temperature, strain rates and pressure, occurring especially in high speed machining, the adhered contact phenomenon is highly localized especially near to the tool tip and extremely non-linear due to strong influence of the secondary shear zone (SSZ) and the nature of bonds between asperities of tool and chip. In addition, the analysis based on post-mortem examinations of chips and worn tools, especially in hard metal cutting alloy and high speed machining, show that the adhered friction with intimate contact and no relative motion of the material chip on the interface, are the principal cause of appearance of the plastic deformation layers (SSZ). This localized shear zone plays a role of intensive heat sources interacting with the <b>tool</b> <b>side</b> and, in turn, activates diffusive and abrasive wear. In this work, a hybrid model combining analytical and numerical approaches is performed in order to solve the non-linear thermomechanical problem on the chip and predicts the nature of friction contact, i. e. fully sliding, sticking/sliding or fully sticking contact, and these for a given distribution of asperities, characterizing the ratio between the real and apparent contact areas A(r) /A(n) on the interface, and a given global friction coefficient (mu) over bar, characterizing the ratio of the experimental cutting forces. The shear stress generated in the primary shear band, the energy produced in the secondary shear zone, the local friction coefficient and the friction energy produced on the sliding part of contact, the proportion of the sticking/sliding interfaces, and geometrical parameters of the chip, are obtained by analytical means. The analysis of this model is based on experimental data and applied for a large cutting speed (1 ms(- 1) <= V <= 60 ms(- 1)) and able to give some correlation about the distribution of adhesions marks on the contact with respect to the distribution of the tribological parameters at the interface.

40|$|Avoiding {{negative}} effects of conventional lubrication in forming operations stimulates research on lubricant free forming processes. Increased friction and wear due to direct contact between tool and workpiece surface lead to insufficient forming results in dry forming operations. Dry deep drawing of rectangular cups with conventional tools reveals cracks and wrinkles. This necessitates the development of <b>tool</b> <b>sided</b> surface modifications which face the challenges of lubricant free forming. As former results of tribological investigations have shown, adhesion is the dominant friction and wear mechanism. Therefore, diamond-like carbon coatings are applied to decrease adhesion. The mechanical properties of a-C:H:W- and ta-C-coatings are systematically analyzed to reduce friction and wear. Additionally, micro features are generated by laser texturing of a-C:H:W coatings to control material flow by locally adapted frictional conditions. The effects of different feature edge geometries and the feature orientation are investigated in ring-on-disc tribometer tests. Depending on the deposition parameters some a-C:H:W coating variants show reduction of adhesion for DC 04. However, in contact with aluminum alloys no improve of tribological conditions could be achieved. ta-C coatings affect the reduction of friction and wear in contact with DC 04 and aluminum and show high potential for application in dry forming processes. Depending on adhesion affinity of the workpiece material, micro features can increase friction by adjusting their edge geometry, orientation and area coverage. The tribological behavior of selected surface modifications is finally analyzed in the strip drawing test. The obtained results gain basic knowledge for development of surface modifications towards realization of lubricant free deep drawing by a tailored tool concept...|$|R
