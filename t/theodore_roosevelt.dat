5|$|Later, {{during the}} auto trail era, the modern US23 also {{coincided with the}} east branch of the Dixie Highway {{and part of the}} Lower Peninsula section of the <b>Theodore</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> International Highway. The Dixie Highway was created by William S. Gilbreath after he {{developed}} the Lincoln Highway. The highway was designed to link the Great Lakes with the Gulf of Mexico, and to commemorate a half century of peace between the North and the South after the American Civil War. At the urging of Governor Woodbridge Ferris, the northern terminus was located at the Straits of Mackinac. The highway had two branches in the Lower Peninsula; the eastern branch followed what later became US23 north of Standish. The <b>Theodore</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> International Highway was named for former US president <b>Theodore</b> <b>Roosevelt</b> after his death in 1919. Overall, this highway ran from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario. In Michigan, it also followed US23 north of Standish.|$|E
