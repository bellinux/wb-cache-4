500|$|Asked if {{he thought}} Bowyer could still win the {{championship}} after this setback, Stewart argued, [...] "It's possible for sure. The biggest <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{be going to the}} race track and having that stress of not having his crew chief, not having his car chief and those are two key people on a race weekend... I can promise you that Childress has the resources to cover this... it's definitely possible, but everyone else {{is going to have to}} have trouble." [...] Bowyer did not lose the victory title for the race itself; NASCAR vice president of competition Robin Pemberton commented, [...] "We don't consider taking away the win. If you ask some, they would consider a 150-point penalty with only nine races to go in the Chase a pretty hefty penalty." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2004, Domínguez made {{international}} headlines {{when she}} signed a two-year contract for second division men's team, Atlético Celaya, in Guanajuato, Mexico. Domínguez {{said of the}} signing, [...] "The thing is, that in Mexico we don't have even a decent amateur league for women, {{so you have to}} look for other options... I knew that the decision could go either way, but were expecting a yes. The hard <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be equaling the physical force of the men, but the technique, the desire, the willpower, those are things that I already have." [...] While the Mexican Football Association did not object, they deferred to FIFA headquarters in Zurich for an official ruling. FIFA ruled against mixed-sex football teams stating, [...] "There must be a clear separation between men's and women's football." [...] Furthermore, a ban was placed on Domínguez for playing in an exhibition game outside the league but still alongside men. [...] "I just wanted to be given the chance to try," [...] Domínguez said. [...] "If I failed I would have been the first to say I can't do it, the first to admit it doesn't work. But at least I would have tried." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though Westlife didn't gain as {{much success}} in the States as they did elsewhere, their music was still appreciated. Kid David Corey, {{assistant}} PD and music director at top 40 WXKS (Kiss 108) radio station in Boston, MA was a Westlife supporter that was recorded saying [...] "Bands like Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync are still climbing the charts, and radio is supporting them, so I don't think the boy band <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> hurt them. Besides, this song [...] is just too good for any of {{that to be a}} concern. I can't imagine anyone not playing this because it's another boy band, especially when it doesn't even sound like those other guys." ...|$|E

Three or four new carts {{are going to be}} put on instead of some of the old ones, and there are ten first-rate horses coming in place of some of those that are getting past work.
