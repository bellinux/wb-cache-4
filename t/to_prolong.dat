5|$|Poniatowski {{accompanied}} the Ottomans during the Pruth River Campaign, but was {{dissatisfied with the}} Treaty of the Pruth, which saw {{the withdrawal of the}} Ottomans from the war. His attempts <b>to</b> <b>prolong</b> and inflame the conflict failed, resulting in a loss of his status in the Empire and his eventual departure from it in 1713.|$|E
5|$|At birth, infants {{are unable}} to wait for their wants {{and needs to be}} met and exhibit a {{defining}} lack of impulse control. With age, developing children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate desires and are increasingly able <b>to</b> <b>prolong</b> gratification. Developmental psychologists study the progression of impulse control and delay of gratification over the lifespan, including deficiencies in development that are closely related to attention deficits and behavior problems.|$|E

5|$|Celia Solis (Daniella Baltodano), {{one of the}} Solis' daughters, {{comes down}} with chickenpox. Since Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) has never had the illness, she is forced to leave the house. She stays with neighbors Bob (Tuc Watkins) and Lee (Kevin Rahm), where she enjoys partying and {{drinking}} with them so much she tries <b>to</b> <b>prolong</b> her visit. During a party, Gabrielle accidentally stumbles into a nursery, and learns Bob and Lee {{have been trying to}} adopt a baby. With a new appreciation for her children, Gabrielle returns home.|$|E

At treatment, it was revealed that he had torn his lateral meniscus. With one year left on his contract, Tasci said he was aiming to make progress to sign a new contract, having expressed a desire <b>to</b> <b>prolong</b> his contract to stay at Stuttgart.|$|E
5|$|Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) {{have been}} known <b>to</b> <b>prolong</b> and enhance the effects of psilocybin. Alcohol {{consumption}} may enhance the effects of psilocybin, because acetaldehyde, {{one of the primary}} breakdown metabolites of consumed alcohol, reacts with biogenic amines present in the body to produce MAOIs related to tetrahydroisoquinoline and β-carboline. Tobacco smokers may also experience more powerful effects with psilocybin, because tobacco smoke exposure decreases the activity of MAO in the brain and peripheral organs.|$|E

5|$|On December 10, 1916, Henry Descoins, the {{commander}} of the French garrison of Korçë, with the approval of Maurice Sarrail, declared the Autonomous Albanian Republic of Korçë, and appointed Themistokli Gërmenji as prefect. In the following period the Greeks of the city were persecuted by the Albanian nationalist elements that aimed at acquiring control over Korçë. As a result, the local Greeks asked the French authorities <b>to</b> <b>prolong</b> their occupation until the end of World War I.|$|E
5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid <b>to</b> <b>prolong</b> the negotiations. He {{would agree}} to our terms, then he would try and tell us it was out of his hands, and go back on his word. If it was out of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E
5|$|Early {{mediation}} {{attempts in}} March 1499 had failed because of mutual distrust between the parties. But {{after the battle}} of Dornach, the Swabian League was war-weary and had lost all confidence in the king's abilities as a military leader, and thus refused Maximilian's demands to muster a new army. The Swabian and Habsburg armies had suffered far higher human losses than the Swiss, and were also short on artillery, after repeatedly having lost their equipment to the Swiss. The Swiss also had no interest <b>to</b> <b>prolong</b> the war further, though they refused a first peace proposal that Maximilian presented at Schaffhausen in August 1499.|$|E

5|$|In January {{and again}} in February, Lenin urged the Bolsheviks to accept Germany's proposals. He argued that the {{territorial}} losses were acceptable if it ensured {{the survival of the}} Bolshevik-led government. The majority of Bolsheviks rejected his position, hoping <b>to</b> <b>prolong</b> the armistice and call Germany's bluff. On 18 February, the German Army launched Operation Faustschlag, advancing further into Russian-controlled territory and conquering Dvinsk within a day. At this point, Lenin finally convinced a small majority of the Bolshevik Central Committee to accept the Central Powers' demands. On 23 February, the Central Powers issued a new ultimatum: Russia had to recognise German control not only of Poland and the Baltic states but also of Ukraine, or face a full-scale invasion.|$|E
5|$|It {{was used}} in {{relation}} to the Government of Ireland Act 1914, which had been under the threat of a Lords veto, now removed. Ulster Protestants had been firmly against the passing of the bill. However, it never came into force because of the outbreak of the First World War. Amendments to the Parliament Act 1911 were made <b>to</b> <b>prolong</b> the life of the 1910 parliament following the outbreak of the First World War and 1935 parliament because of the Second World War. These made special exemptions to the requirement to hold a general election every five years.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} also subject to criticism, however. Next Generation {{objected to the}} {{difficulty}} level, wondering if the challenge was added <b>to</b> <b>prolong</b> the gameplay. The Electric Playground pointed to the unusual control scheme and lack of configuration options. GameSpy cited the camera's behavior, the learning curve for the controls, and graphical shortcomings such as flickering and jagginess. GameSpot criticized the game's conclusion for its dramatic change in gameplay to a rail shooter-like style at the story's climax, {{as well as a}} leveling-off of the difficulty. Lastly, Gamecritics felt that the story was overly short and the characters were underdeveloped.|$|E

5|$|The intelligence, domesticability and {{versatility}} of {{the elephant}} gave it considerable advantages over other wild {{animals such as}} lions and bears used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more tractable than horses: while a horse can be trained to charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead step over him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of war elephants with generals such as Hannibal. Elephants can be trained to execute prisoners {{in a variety of}} ways, and can be taught <b>to</b> <b>prolong</b> the agony of the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill the condemned quickly by stepping on the head.|$|E
5|$|The next year, the {{archbishop}} refused to crown Eustace and was again exiled by Stephen, who {{was attempting to}} secure the succession for his son by imitating the Capetian dynasty of France, which usually saw the king's heir crowned during his father's lifetime. Although Theobald claimed papal authority for refusal, based on the prohibition by Celestine, it was more probable {{that he and the}} bishops had no desire <b>to</b> <b>prolong</b> the civil war. Stephen demanded in April 1152 that Theobald crown Eustace, but {{the archbishop}} once again refused, and went into exile in Flanders. Theobald claimed that Stephen had gained the throne through perjury, implying that if the archbishop crowned Eustace, Theobald would be perpetuating this crime. The king and the archbishop reached a truce in August.|$|E
5|$|The team {{is called}} {{to the home of}} a man whose heart was removed through a {{makeshift}} operation. They learn that not only did someone call for emergency help shortly after the heart's removal, but the man was found alive by the emergency response team well after his heart was removed, though he eventually died by the time Fringe arrived. Walter (John Noble) and Peter recognize scars on the blood vessels leading to the heart, identifying the victim as one that received a heart transplant. During the autopsy at the lab, Walter concludes that a serum was used <b>to</b> <b>prolong</b> the victim's life well after the heart's removal, a chemical based on his own past research into life restoration.|$|E

5|$|Three {{different}} early {{versions of}} the play are extant: the First Quarto (Q1, 1603); the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604); and the First Folio (F1, 1623). Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others. The play's structure and depth of characterisation have inspired much critical scrutiny. One such example is the centuries-old debate about Hamlet's hesitation to kill his uncle, which some see as merely a plot device <b>to</b> <b>prolong</b> the action, but which others argue is a dramatisation of the complex philosophical and ethical issues that surround cold-blooded murder, calculated revenge, and thwarted desire. More recently, psychoanalytic critics have examined Hamlet's unconscious desires, while feminist critics have re-evaluated and attempted to rehabilitate the often maligned characters of Ophelia and Gertrude.|$|E
5|$|To this end, Stalin and Molotov {{strung out}} the {{negotiations}} with the Japanese, giving them false hope of a Soviet-mediated peace. At the same time, in their dealings with the United States and Britain, the Soviets insisted on strict adherence to the Cairo Declaration, re-affirmed at the Yalta Conference, that the Allies would not accept separate or conditional peace with Japan. The Japanese would have to surrender unconditionally to all the Allies. <b>To</b> <b>prolong</b> the war, the Soviets opposed any attempt to weaken this requirement. This would give the Soviets time to complete the transfer of their troops from the Western Front to the Far East, and conquer Manchuria (Manchukuo), Inner Mongolia (Mengjiang), Korea, South Sakhalin, the Kuriles, and possibly, Hokkaidō (starting with a landing at Rumoi).|$|E
5|$|Today, player–managers {{have become}} rare in baseball. Pete Rose {{is the most}} recent player–manager, serving from 1984 through 1986 with the Cincinnati Reds. Whereas some player–managers, such as Lou Boudreau, were {{full-time}} players as player–managers, by the time Rose became player–manager, he was a part-time player. Rose was trying <b>to</b> <b>prolong</b> his career to break the all-time hit record set by Ty Cobb, and Reds owner Marge Schott used this as a marketing ploy. Rose removed himself from the 40-man roster after the 1986 season {{to make room for}} Pat Pacillo, unofficially retiring as a player, but remained as the Reds manager until he was banned from baseball following the release of the Dowd Report in 1989.|$|E
