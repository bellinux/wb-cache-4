She was heavily influenced by the works of Thomas Carlyle and John Ruskin, setting her on the path of socialism.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} strands to the history of fiddle playing in County Donegal. Perhaps the best-known and, in {{the last half of the}} twentieth century, the most influential has been that of the Doherty family. Hugh Doherty is the first known musician of this family. Born in 1790, he headed an unbroken tradition of fiddlers and pipers in the Doherty family until the death, in 1980, of perhaps the best-known Donegal fiddler, John Doherty. John, a travelling <b>tinsmith,</b> was known for his extremely precise and fast finger- and bow-work and vast repertoire, and is considered to be one of the greatest Irish fiddlers ever recorded. John's older brother, Mickey, was also recorded and, though Mickey was another of the great Irish fiddlers, his reputation has been overshadowed by John's.|$|E

25|$|William Tylee Ranney {{was born}} in Middletown, Connecticut on May 9, 1813, the son of William Ranney, a sea captain, and Clarissa Ranney. In 1826, {{at the age of}} 13, he moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina, to live with his {{maternal}} uncle, merchant William Nott, and be apprenticed as a <b>tinsmith.</b> It is believed that Ranney developed his first sketches during this period.|$|E
25|$|The simple shapes {{made by the}} <b>tinsmith</b> require tools {{similar to}} a coppersmith. In {{addition}} to the big shears anchored in {{a hole in his}} bench he used hand snips and nippers for cutting. The tin was flattened on an anvil made of a block of steel. Straight and curved anvils (stakes) were used to turn and roll the edges of the tin. Solder was then used to join the pieces together; a soldering iron and fire pot were needed to do this.|$|E
50|$|These {{craftsmen}} {{also had}} their own guild and took up the important preparatory work for the <b>tinsmiths,</b> and also for other smiths. The works were powered by water.|$|R

25|$|Disgusted by the {{unconditional}} obedience {{demanded by}} the Catholic orphanage and drawn {{by the prospect of}} adventure, Rocker ran away from the orphanage twice. The first time he just wandered around in the woods around Mainz with occasional visits to the city to forage for food and was retrieved after three nights. The second time, which was at the age of fourteen and a reaction to the orphanage wanting him to be apprenticed as a <b>tinsmith,</b> he worked as a cabin-boy for Köln-Düsseldorfer Dampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft. He enjoyed leaving his hometown and traveling to places like Rotterdam. After he returned, he started an apprenticeship to become a typographer like his uncle Carl.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>tinsmith</b> {{has been}} plying his trade in America since 1720. Colonial tinsmiths used {{tinplate}}, wire, solder, {{and a few}} simple tools to produce their wares. When tinplate was finally produced in America in the early 19th century {{the products of the}} <b>tinsmith</b> became more widely available. They in turn saw an increase in demand and a need to speed up production. This brought about the development of many ingenious hand powered machines which sped up production and helped the <b>tinsmith</b> meet the demands for his products. The goods were [...] "brought to market" [...] by peddlers.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>tinsmith</b> {{learned his}} trade, {{like many other}} artisans, by serving an {{apprenticeship}} of 4 to 6 years with a master <b>tinsmith.</b> Apprenticeships were considered [...] "indentures" [...] and an apprentice would start out first with simply cleaning the shop, polishing tools, keeping the fires lit, filing sharp edges and polishing finished pieces. Later he would trace patterns on sheets and cut them out, then soldering joints, and inserting rivets. Finally, {{he was allowed to}} cut out and complete objects. He learned first to make cake stamps (cookie cutters), pill boxes and other simple items. Next, he formed objects such as milk pails, basins, cake and pie pans. Later he tackled more complicated pieces such as chandeliers and crooked-spout coffee pots.|$|E

Sixsmith is variant spelling of a sickle- or scythe-smith. Wildsmith in turn is a corruption of wheelsmith ...|$|E

2500|$|Luray Caverns was {{discovered}} on August 13, 1878 by five local men, including Andrew J. Campbell (a local <b>tinsmith),</b> his 13-year-old nephew Quint, and local photographer Benton Stebbins. [...] Their attention had been attracted by a protruding limestone outcrop {{and by a}} nearby sinkhole noted to have cool air issuing from it. [...] Seeking an underground cavern, the men started to dig and, about four hours later, a hole was created for the smallest men (Andrew and Quint) to squeeze through, slide down a rope and explore by candlelight. [...] The first column they saw was named the Washington Column, {{in honor of the}} first United States President. Upon entering the area called Skeleton's Gorge, bone fragments (among other artifacts) were found embedded in calcite. [...] Other traces of previous human occupation included pieces of charcoal, flint, and human bone fragments embedded in stalagmite. [...] A skeleton, thought to be that of a Native American girl, found in one of the chasms, was estimated, from the current rate of stalagmitic growth, to be not more than 500 years old. [...] Her remains may have slipped into the caverns after her burial hole collapsed due to a sinkhole, although the real cause is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|The final part of Sadoveanu's {{creation}} also comprises {{a series}} of pieces where the narrative approach was, according to Crohmălniceanu, [...] "corrected" [...] to show his favorite recluse type won over by the new society. In essence, Ungureanu argues, the new style that of [...] "reportage and plain information, adapted to orders coming from above". Such works include the 1951 Nada Florilor ("The Flowers' Lure") and Clonț-de-fier ("Iron Bucktooth"), alongside an unfinished piece, Cântecul mioarei ("Song of the Ewe"). In Nada..., the peasant boy Culai follows his hero, <b>tinsmith</b> Alecuțu, into factory life. Clonț-de-fier, an ideologized retake on Demonul tinereții, is about a monk returning from seclusion {{into the world of}} workers, where the landscape is reshaped by large-scale construction works. According to Ungureanu, it also shows Sadoveanu's universe stripped of [...] "all its deep meanings." [...] While their author came to personify the new cultural guidelines, Sadoveanu's previous books, from Frații Jderi to Baltagul, were subject to communist censorship. Various statements contradicting the ideological guidelines were cut out of new editions: the books in general could no longer include mentions of Bessarabia (a region first incorporated into the Soviet Union by a 1940 occupation) or Romanian Orthodox beliefs. In one such instance, censors of Baltagul removed a character's claim that [...] "the Russian" [...] was by nature [...] "the drunkest of them all, [...] a worthy beggar and singer at the fairs." ...|$|E
