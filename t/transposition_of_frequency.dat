40|$|<b>Transposition</b> <b>of</b> Tn 5 in Escherichia coli strains {{containing}} one {{or multiple}} {{copies of the}} transposable element was investigated.

Experiments measuring the <b>transposition</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> differentially marked Tn 5 s confirmed that the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>transposition</b> <b>of</b> an individual Tn 5 decreased proportionally with the total number of copies of the element present in a cell. The IS 50 R-encoded function, protein 2, which has previously been shown to be an inhibitor <b>of</b> <b>transposition,</b> is sufficient to mediate this inhibitory effect.

40|$|I& 5011. the {{inverted}} repeat sequence of Tn 5 {{which is responsible for}} supplying functions that promote and control Tn 5 transposition, encodes two polypeptldes that differ at their N terminus. Frameshift, in-frame deletion, nonsense, and missense mutations within the N terminus of protein 1 (which is not present in protein 2) were isolated and characterized. The properties of these mutations demonstrate that protein 1 is absolutely required for Tn 5 <b>transposition.</b> None <b>of</b> these mutations affected the inhibitory activity of IS 50, confirming that protein 2 is sufficient to mediate inhibition <b>of</b> Tn 5 <b>transposition.</b> The effects on <b>transposition</b> <b>of</b> increasing the amount of protein 2 (the inhibitor) relative to protein 1 (the transposase) were also analyzed. Relatively large amounts of protein 2 were required to see a significant decrease in the <b>transposition</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> an element. In addition, varying the co-ordinate synthesis of the IS 50 R proteins over a W-fold range had little effect on the transposition frequency. These studies suggest that neither the wild-type synthesis rate of protein 2 relative to protein 1 nor the amount of synthesis of both ISSOR proteins is the only factor responsible for controlling the <b>transposition</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> a wild-type Tn 5 element in Escherichia coli. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} the absorption of 2 D water waves by the horizontal motions of a vertical plane in response to the hydrodynamical force it experiences. The solution of this problem is straightforward in the frequency domain. Unfortunately, the <b>transposition</b> <b>of</b> the <b>frequency</b> domain solution to the time domain by inverse Fourier transforming leads to a non-causal impulse response function. Thus it cannot be used just as it is, neither as a control loop for physical absorbing devices nor as a non radiating boundary condition (NRBC) in numerical modeling. In this paper, we propose a method to derive causal approximations of this ideal controller. Two time-domain absorbing relations are proposed, differing in whether or not one knows a dominant <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> the incident wave train to be absorbed.

However, in cells that are deficient for both integration host factor (IHF) and Dam methylase, the <b>transposition</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> IS 50 and Tn 5 approximate those found in wild-type cells. The absence of IHF alone has no effect on either IS 50 or Tn 5 transposition. These results suggest that IHF is required for the increased <b>transposition</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>of</b> IS 50 and Tn 5 that are observed in Dam- cells. It is also shown that the level of expression of IS 50 -encoded proteins, P 1 and P 2, required for IS 50 and Tn 5 transposition and its regulation does not decrease in IHF- or in IHF- Dam- cells. This result suggests that the effects of IHF on IS 50 and Tn 5 transposition are not at the level of IS 50 gene expression. Finally, IHF is demonstrated to significantly retard the electrophoretic mobility of a 289 -base-pair segment of IS 50 DNA that contains a putative IHF protein-binding site. The physiological role of this IHF binding site remains to be determined...|$|R

Analysis <b>of</b> the RNA and proteins synthesized from the mutants led to the proposal that p 2 can inhibit transposition at normal physiological concentrations.

40|$|An {{efficient}} and quantitative method {{to analyze the}} <b>transposition</b> <b>of</b> various insertion sequence (IS) elements in Burkholderia multivorans ATCC 17616 was devised. pGEN 500, a plasmid carrying a Bacillus subtilis-derived sacB gene, was introduced into ATCC 17616 cells, and 25 % of their sucrose-resistant derivatives were found to carry various IS elements on pGEN 500. A PCR-based experimental protocol, in which a mixture of several specific primer pairs was used, revealed that pGEN 500 captured, in addition to five previously reported IS elements (IS 401, IS 402, IS 406, IS 407, and IS 408), three novel IS elements, ISBmu 1, ISBmu 2, and ISBmu 3. The global <b>transposition</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> these IS elements was enhanced more than sevenfold under a high-temperature condition (42 °C) but not under oxidative stress or starvation conditions.

40|$|Mutations in top, the {{structural}} gene for Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I, {{have been identified}} and mapped at 28 min on the chromosome, near cysB. Strains carrying deletions of the top gene are viable. The top mutations, however, do exert pleiotropic effects on transcription and transposition. Mutants lacking DNA topoisomerase I have a more rapid rate of induction and {{a higher level of}} catabolite-sensitive enzymes including tryptophanase and beta-galactosidase. This general activation of transcription by top mutations can be attributed to an increase in the negative superhelicity of the DNA in vivo when the topoisomerase activity is abolished. The <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>transposition</b> <b>of</b> Tn 5, a transposon carrying kanamycin resistance, is decreased by a factor of 40 or more in top mutants. A direct or indirect role of the topoisomerase in transposition is discussed. The <b>transposition</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> Tn 3, however, is not dependent on top.

40|$|The <b>transposition</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> Tam 3 in Antirrhinum majus, {{unlike that}} of most other cut-and-paste-type transposons, is tightly {{controlled}} by temperature: Tam 3 transposes rarely at 25 °C, but much more frequently at 15 °C. Here, we studied the mechanism <b>of</b> the low-temperature-dependent <b>transposition</b> (LTDT) <b>of</b> Tam 3. Our results strongly suggest that LTDT {{is not likely to}} be due to either transcriptional regulation or posttranscriptional regulation of the Tam 3 TPase gene. We found that temperature shift induced a remarkable change of the methylation state unique to Tam 3 sequences in the genome: Higher temperature resulted in hypermethylation, whereas lower temperature resulted in reduced methylation. The methylation state was reversible within a single generation in response to a temperature shift. Although our data demonstrate a close link between LTDT and the methylation of Tam 3, they also suggest that secondary factor(s) other than DNA methylation is involved in repression <b>of</b> Tam 3 <b>transposition...</b>|$|R

40|$|It {{is still}} an open {{question}} whether mutation rate can vary across the bacterial chromosome. In this study, the occurrence of mutations within the same mutational target sequences at different chromosomal locations of Pseudomonas putida was monitored. For that purpose we constructed two mutation detection systems, one for monitoring the occurrence of a broad spectrum <b>of</b> mutations and <b>transposition</b> <b>of</b> IS element IS 1411 inactivating LacI repressor, and another for detecting 1 -bp deletions. Our results revealed that both the mutation frequency and the spectrum of mutations vary at different chromosomal positions. We observed higher mutation frequencies when the direction of transcription of the mutational target gene was opposite to the direction of replisome movement in the chromosome and vice versa, lower mutation frequency was accompanied with co-directional transcription and replication. Additionally, asymmetry of frameshift mutagenesis at homopolymeric and repetitive sequences during the leading and lagging-strand replication was found. The <b>transposition</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> IS 1411 was also affected by the chromosomal location of the target site, which implies that regional differences in chromosomal topology may influence <b>transposition</b> <b>of</b> this mobile element. The occurrence of mutations in the P. putida chromosome was investigated both in growing and in stationary-phase bacteria.

40|$|We {{describe}} here a new rapid {{screen that}} allows easy detection of transposon or host mutations that affect Tn 10 transposition in Escherichia coli. This test involves a new Tn 10 derivative called the "mini-lacZ-kanR fusion hopper" or mini-Tn 10 -LK for short. This element does not direct expression of β-galactosidase when present at its original starting location on a suitably engineered plasmid or phage genome because it lacks appropriate transcription and translation start signals. However, <b>transposition</b> <b>of</b> this element into the chromosome of E. coli lacZ- bacteria leads to productive fusions {{in which the}} lacZ gene within the transposon is expressed from external chromosomal signals.

MethodsWe performed a retrospective cohort study from a baseline of 18 years, including life table and Kaplan–Meier analysis for probability of death/transplant, arrhythmia, surgical or percutaneous intervention, and permanent pacemaker insertion.
