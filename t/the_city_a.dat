5|$|After the Fatimid caliphs {{moved to}} Egypt, el-Mansuriya {{remained}} {{the capital of}} the Zirids, who became the local rulers, for the next eighty-five years. The Zirid ruler el-Mansur bin Buluqqin built a palace for himself at el-Mansuriya. There is a record of the lavish marriage in 1022-23 of his grandson, the young Zirid el-Muizz bin Badis. Pavilions were built outside <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> <b>a</b> large array of textiles and manufactured good was displayed and music was provided by a great number of instruments.

5|$|Alexios {{advanced}} from Salonica {{and pitched}} {{camp on the}} river Charzanes near Dyrrhachium on October 15.

Alexios, however, favoured an immediate assault, hoping to catch Guiscard's army from the rear, {{while they were still}} besieging the city.

5|$|Alexios was {{replaced}} as commander by John Tarchaneiotes, first cousin of Andronikos II, and {{disappeared from the}} scene for 30 years. His successors proved greatly inferior, and by 1323, Byzantine possessions in Asia had been greatly reduced. At that point, Patriarch Jesaias urged Andronikos to recall the aged general. A desperate Andronikos agreed and pardoned Alexios in 1324. Alexios was tasked with relieving the isolated exclave of Philadelphia, which had been long under siege {{and was ready to}} fall. He was given no army, but, according to the Byzantine chroniclers, the mere news of Alexios's approach, and the respect in which the Turks held him, was enough for the siege to be lifted. Alexios was appointed governor of <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> <b>a</b> position he retained until 1327.|$|E

Wood, tarpaper, and cardboard were all scattered throughout La Paz. By October 2, rescue teams had covered 38sqmi (100sqkm) to configure the damage. Throughout <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> <b>a</b> total of 412 people had been killed, 150 were missing people within the resort city, five of which were later presumed dead.

The city's Polish citizens on the whole were delighted; their politicians envisaged a separate Lithuanian state closely allied with Poland. Representatives from the city were immediately sent to the Paris Peace Conference, and the Stefan Batory University in Vilnius, which had been closed in 1832 following the November 1830 Uprising, was reopened.|$|E

5|$|By 2000, {{the city}} of Sacramento {{maintained}} the non-freeway portion of SR 160 within the city limits under a contract with Caltrans.

Under a law passed in July 1999, Caltrans was authorized to relinquish any part of Route 160 within the city limits to Sacramento. The two agencies agreed, and on October 19, 2000 the portion from the south city limits to the American River became the full responsibility of <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> <b>A</b> 2003 amendment to the Streets and Highways Code erroneously deleted not only this part, but the North Sacramento Freeway as well.|$|E

5|$|By the 15th century, most of Mdina's enciente had {{a system}} of double walls.

In the 1450s there were fears of a Barbary or Ottoman attack, so efforts were made to improve Mdina's walls. The main ditch was completed, and the Castellu di la Chitati was partially demolished by royal licence in 1453, due to its ruinous state and the excessive cost for its upkeep.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the action}} the Tripolitanians had lost their three largest vessels and {{suffered}} heavy casualties, while the Sardinians only had two dead and five wounded. Later in the day while Sivori was making preparations for another attack on <b>the</b> <b>city,</b> <b>a</b> Dutch brig sailed out of port saluting him and signaling that it wished to communicate with him. Upon contacting the squadron, the brig's captain sent Sivori the congratulatory remarks of the British consul at Tripoli. The Sardinian commander sent the Dutch vessel back into port with a message to Karamanli that if he did not commence negotiations, further military action would be taken against the city. Rather than suffer continued action from the Sardinians, Karamanli acceded to the Sardinian requests and sent an envoy out to the Sardinian squadron.|$|E
5|$|Chinautla Viejo was {{attacked}} by the invading Spanish in 1525; the first two attacks against the heavily fortified city were unsuccessful.

The culture of Tell Brak was defined by the different civilizations that inhabited it, and it was famous for its glyptic style, equids and glass. When independent, the city was ruled by a local assembly or by a monarch. Tell Brak was a trade center due to its location between Anatolia, the Levant and southern Mesopotamia. It was excavated by Max Mallowan in 1937, then regularly by different teams between 1979 and 2011, when the work stopped due to the Syrian Civil War.|$|E
