5|$|Crush {{injuries}} {{are common in}} major disasters, especially in earthquakes. The aftermath of the 1988 Spitak earthquake prompted the establishment, in 1995, of the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force, a working group of <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Society</b> of Nephrology (a worldwide body of kidney experts). Its volunteer doctors and nurses assisted {{for the first time}} in the 1999 İzmit earthquake in Turkey, where 17,480 people died, 5392 were hospitalized and 477 received dialysis, with positive results. Treatment units are generally established outside the immediate disaster area, as aftershocks could potentially injure or kill staff and make equipment unusable.|$|E

5|$|ISMB 1997 {{was held}} in Halkidiki, Greece and marked the {{foundation}} of <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Society</b> for Computational Biology (ISCB). ISCB was formed {{with a focus on}} managing all scientific, organizational and financial aspects of the ISMB conference and to provide a forum for scientists to address the emerging role of computers in the biological sciences. ISCB has assisted in organising the ISMB conference series since 1998. The period following the formation of ISCB also marked an expansion in the number of ISMB attendees: ISMB 2000 (held at the University of California, San Diego) was attended by over 1,000 delegates, submitting 141 scientific papers. This meeting was also the last time ISMB would be held at a university, due to size limitations.|$|E
5|$|Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) is {{an annual}} {{academic}} {{conference on the}} subjects of bioinformatics and computational biology organised by <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Society</b> for Computational Biology (ISCB).

The conference has been held every year since 1993 and has grown {{to become one of}} the largest and most prestigious meetings in these fields, hosting over 2,000 delegates in 2004. From the first meeting, ISMB has been held in locations worldwide; since 2007, meetings have been located in Europe and North America in alternating years. Since 2004, European meetings have been held jointly with the European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB).|$|E
5|$|Returning to Australia in 1918, Rix Nicholas {{once more}} took up {{professional}} painting, and held {{an exhibition of}} over a hundred works at Melbourne's Guild Hall. Many sold, including In Picardy, purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria. Following a period painting in rural locations in the early 1920s, Rix Nicholas returned to Europe. A 1925 exhibition in Paris led to the sale of her work In Australia to the Musée du Luxembourg, followed by an extensive tour of her paintings around regional British art galleries. There followed representation in other exhibitions, including at <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Society</b> of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers, and the Royal Academy of Arts, both in London. Following the inclusion of several works in the 1926 Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts Spring exhibition in Paris she was made an Associate of that organisation.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequent}} questions {{in the study of}} Chinese foreign policy is whether China can be regarded as a responsible member of <b>international</b> <b>society.</b> It is <b>the</b> aim of the presented thesis to look more closely at China's behaviour in <b>the</b> present <b>international</b> <b>society</b> in terms of responsibility. The thesis utilizes <b>the</b> concept of <b>international</b> <b>society</b> developed by <b>the</b> English school of international relations and interconnects it with the concept of responsibility in international relations to determine a set of criteria which an ordinary state or great power must meet in order to be regarded as responsible in <b>the</b> present <b>international</b> <b>society.</b> In order to determine whether China behaves as a responsible ordinary state or great power on <b>the</b> <b>international</b> level, <b>the</b> thesis utilizes the method {{of the most}} likely and the least likely case studies. The analysis of China's behaviour in the World Trade Organization and within the nuclear non-proliferation regime can provide sufficient evidence of China's acceptance of primary institutions forming the backbone of <b>the</b> present <b>international</b> <b>society.</b> <b>The</b> findings have serious implications for thinking of contemporary China as a status quo state respecting institutions and rules of <b>the</b> present <b>international</b> <b>society...</b>|$|R

5|$|That year, Chisholm {{revived the}} South African College of Music where he {{eventually}} would teach composer Stefans Grové and singer Désirée Talbot. Using Edinburgh University as his model, Chisholm appointed new staff, extended {{the number of}} courses, and introduced new degrees and diplomas. In order to encourage budding South African musicians he founded the South African National Music Press in 1948. With {{the assistance of the}} Italian baritone Gregorio Fiasconaro, Chisholm also established the college's opera company in 1951 and opera school in 1954. In addition, Chisholm founded the South African section of <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Society</b> for Contemporary Music (ISCM) in 1948, assisted in the founding of the Maynardville Open-Air Theatre on 1 December 1950, and pursued an international conducting career.|$|E
5|$|The late 1970s and 1980s saw {{a massive}} {{increase}} of AAC-related research, publications, and training {{as well the}} first national and international conferences. <b>The</b> <b>International</b> <b>Society</b> for Alternative and Augmentative Communication (ISAAC) was founded in 1983; its members included clinicians, teachers, rehabilitation engineers, researchers, and AAC users themselves. The organization has since {{played an important role}} in developing the field through its peer-reviewed journal, conferences, national chapters and its focus on AAC in developing countries. AAC became an area of professional specialization; a 1981 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association position paper, for example, recognized AAC as a field of practice for speech-language pathologists. At the same time, AAC users and family members played an increasing prominent role in the development of knowledge of AAC through their writing and presentations, by serving on committees and founding advocacy organizations.|$|E
5|$|By 1968, {{the wild}} herd were {{concentrated}} mostly on BLM lands owing to previous roundups {{and construction of}} boundary fences. That year, the BLM again stated its intention to remove the herds, {{this time with the}} possibility of returning a small number (either 15 or 35) to the range. In response to the new announcement, the Pryor Mountain Wild Horse Association (PMWHA) was formed with the goal of preventing the roundup, and began working in concert with larger organizations such as <b>the</b> <b>International</b> <b>Society</b> for the Protection of Animals. The BLM argued that the horses were being removed because they were likely to starve, as they had overgrazed their environment, while the PMWHA argued the degradation of the range was not due to the horses and that in fact they were in no danger of starving. The organization further charged that the BLM was acting at the behest of other state and federal organizations who wished to see the horses removed, rather than acting in line with public opinion. The PMWHA was also concerned with the effect that the penning would have on the feral horses.|$|E
