5|$|Adjacent and {{now serving}} as an annex to <b>the</b> <b>Palazzo</b> dei Conservatori is Palazzo Caffarelli Clementino; here, {{short-term}} exhibitions are held. <b>The</b> <b>palazzo</b> was built between 1576 and 1583 by Gregory Canonico for Gian Pietro Caffarelli II. Until the cessation of World War I, <b>the</b> <b>palazzo</b> served as the German Embassy to Rome. Following the war, it was claimed by the Comune di Roma, which demolished a large section of the palazzo's east wing to create the Caffarelli Terrace.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>palazzo</b> {{remained}} the principal Medici residence {{until the last}} male Medici heir died in 1737. It was then occupied briefly by his sister, the elderly Electress Palatine; on her death, the Medici dynasty became extinct and <b>the</b> <b>palazzo</b> passed to the new Grand Dukes of Tuscany, the Austrian House of Lorraine, {{in the person of}} Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor. The Austrian tenancy was briefly interrupted by Napoleon, who used <b>the</b> <b>palazzo</b> during his period of control over Italy.|$|E
5|$|Demolition of the spina of Borgo {{began with}} Mussolini's {{symbolic}} strike {{of the first}} building with a pickaxe on 29 October 1936 and continued for twelve months. Even at the time, the demolition proved controversial, with many Borgo residents displaced en masse to settlements ("borgate") outside of the city. Among the buildings dismantled, either totally or in part, and rebuilt in another position, were <b>the</b> <b>Palazzo</b> dei Convertendi, the house of Giacomo Bartolomeo da Brescia, the Church of the Nunziatina, the palaces Rusticucci-Accoramboni and degli Alicorni (the latter had been already demolished in 1931). Other buildings, like the palace of the Governatore di Borgo and the Churches of San Giacomo Scossacavalli and Sant'Angelo al Corridore, were destroyed. Facing into the cleared area are five other historical buildings, <b>the</b> <b>Palazzo</b> Giraud Torlonia, the church of Santa Maria in Traspontina, <b>the</b> <b>Palazzo</b> dei Penitenzieri, Palazzo Serristori, and Palazzo Cesi (which was mutilated).|$|E

50|$|Brunelleschi's {{influence}} on Michelozzo {{is evident in}} <b>the</b> <b>palazzo's</b> design, especially in the late-medieval bifora-windows, the symmetry and {{the dominance of the}} entrance axis, and the combination of traditional and progressive elements. The arcades and entablature of <b>the</b> <b>palazzo's</b> courtyard also follows the model of the loggia of the Spedale degli Innocenti, which is symptomatically Brunelleschi's earliest and most un-Vitruvian building.|$|R
50|$|Recent {{excavations}} in <b>the</b> <b>palazzo's</b> basement have found, around 7m below street level, a small baths complex, probably part of {{an adjacent}} residential complex already found in 1902 during surveys for <b>the</b> construction of <b>Palazzo</b> delle Assicurazioni di Venezia.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Palazzo</b> Zacco {{is one of}} {{the more}} notable Baroque {{buildings}} of the city, its Corinthian columns supporting balconies of amazing wrought iron work, while supports of grotesques mock, shock or amuse the passerby. <b>The</b> <b>palazzo</b> was built in the second half of the 18th century by the Baron Melfi di San Antonio. It was later acquired by the Zacco family, after which it is named. The building has two street façades, each with six wide balconies bearing the coat of arms of the Melfi family, a frame of acanthus leaves from which a puttino leans. The balconies, a feature of <b>the</b> <b>palazzo,</b> are notable for the differing corbels which support them, ranging from putti to musicians and grotesques. The focal points of the principal façade are the three central balconies, divided by columns with Corinthian capitals. Here the balconies are supported by images of musicians with grotesque faces.|$|E
5|$|A balustrade, {{punctuated by}} sculptures atop the giant pilasters, capped the composition, {{one of the}} most {{influential}} of Michelangelo's designs. The two massive ancient statues of Castor and Pollux that decorate the balustrades are not the same as those posed by Michelangelo, which now are in front of <b>the</b> <b>Palazzo</b> del Quirinale.|$|E
5|$|He {{provided}} new fronts {{to the two}} official {{buildings of}} Rome's civic government, <b>the</b> <b>Palazzo</b> dei Conservatori, the Senatorio, and finally the Nuovo. Michelangelo designed a new façade for the dilapidated Palazzo dei Conservatori and he designed <b>the</b> <b>Palazzo</b> Nuovo to be a mirror complement, thereby providing balance and coherence to the ragged ensemble of existing structures. The construction of these two buildings were carried out after his death {{under the supervision of}} Tommaso Cavalieri. The sole arched motif in the entire Campidoglio design is the segmental pediments over their windows, which give a slight spring to the completely angular vertical-horizontal balance of the design. The three palazzi are now home to the Capitoline Museums.|$|E
50|$|At once, <b>the</b> <b>Palazzo's</b> proprietor, Federico Cesi, {{housed the}} scientifically {{oriented}} Accademia dei Lincei here, attracting such teachers as Galileo Galilei. Today <b>the</b> Cesi's <b>palazzo</b> a small museum {{with a number}} of ancient artefacts, including Roman stone work from nearby Carsulae. The facility is also used for meetings and traveling exhibitions.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>palazzos</b> {{are named}} after the Mocenigo family, seven of whom were Doges of Venice. The English poet Lord Byron (1788-1824) stayed here when he lived in Venice from 1818.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} 18th century, <b>the</b> <b>palazzo</b> {{was used as}} a power base by Napoleon, and later served for a brief period as the {{principal}} royal palace of the newly united Italy. The palace and its contents were donated to the Italian people by King Victor Emmanuel III in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Land on the Boboli hill at {{the rear}} of <b>the</b> <b>palazzo</b> was {{acquired}} {{in order to create a}} large formal park and gardens, today known as the Boboli Gardens. The landscape architect employed for this was the Medici court artist Niccolò Tribolo, who died the following year; he was quickly succeeded by Bartolommeo Ammanati. The original design of the gardens centred on an amphitheatre, behind the corps de logis of <b>the</b> <b>palazzo.</b> The first play recorded as performed there was Andria by Terence in 1476. It was followed by many classically inspired plays of Florentine playwrights such as Giovan Battista Cini. Performed for the amusement of the cultivated Medici court, they featured elaborate sets designed by the court architect Baldassarre Lanci.|$|E

5|$|The palace {{is located}} in the Borgo rione of Rome along the north side of Via della Conciliazione avenue, its main facade facing south. It belongs to the same block as <b>the</b> <b>Palazzo</b> dei Convertendi, another Renaissance {{building}} demolished in the late 1930s and reconstructed in the 1940s east of it. To the west Via Rusticucci separates it from the north Propylaea delimiting the square Piazza Pio XII (which roughly occupies the same area as the old Piazza Rusticucci) and facing Saint Peter's Square. The north side of the building borders two other reconstructed Renaissance edifices of Borgo: <b>the</b> <b>Palazzo</b> Jacopo da Brescia and the house of the physician of Paul III.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>palazzo</b> is now {{the largest}} museum complex in Florence. The {{principal}} palazzo block, often in a building of this design known as the corps de logis, is 32,000 square metres. It is divided into several principal galleries or museums detailed below.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} 18th {{to the early}} 19th century, the {{building}} was also known {{by a number of}} names, including <b>the</b> <b>Palazzo</b> del Tribunale, the Palais de Justice and the Gran Corte della Valletta. By the mid-19th century the building was deemed too small, and the courts were gradually moved to Auberge d'Auvergne between 1840 and 1853. The Castellania was then abandoned, before being briefly converted into an exhibition centre, a tenant house and a school.|$|E

5|$|In Rome the portico of <b>the</b> <b>Palazzo</b> dei Conservatori {{sheltered}} {{offices of}} various guilds. Here disputes arising in the transaction of business were adjudicated, {{unless they were}} of sufficient importance to go before a communal tribunal, {{such as that of}} the conservatori. It was a natural place for such activity. Until the 1470s the main market of the city was held on and around the campidoglio, while cattle continued to be taxed and sold in the ancient forum located just to the south.|$|E
5|$|In the middle, {{and not to}} Michelangelo’s liking, {{stood the}} {{original}} equestrian statue of the emperor Marcus Aurelius. Michelangelo provided an unassuming pedestal for it.
