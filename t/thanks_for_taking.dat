40|$|Many people deserve {{recognition}} for making this Thesis possible. I will start by thanking God, {{who has made}} me realize that no mountain is too big with him on my side, and I want to thank the members of my family for their love and support over the years. Also, I would like to extend my gratitude to all those people in the Air Force that helped me pursue the Air Force Institute of Technology's Scholarships/Fellowships and Grants Program. These include Col Paul L. Jacobs (Ret), and Col Walter R. Dill (Ret). I want to also thank the personnel of AFROTC Detachment 165 at Georgia Tech.

50|$|Before he leaves, Calvin <b>thanks</b> Darryl <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> care of {{him even}} though he wasn't really a baby and admits that he thinks Darryl {{would make a great}} father for a real child someday. Calvin is about to be out of Darryl's life for good, as Darryl watches him leave.

40|$|At {{this point}} of this journey, I {{have to say that}} there are many people who have offered support and {{encouragement}} during some of my most challenging moments and difficult times, and I would like to express my sincerest appreciation to them. I would like to thank the members of my committee: Dr. Reynaldo L. Martinez, Jr., Committee Chair; Dr. Mary Jo Self, Dissertation Director, who spent her invaluable time for reading and revising my drafts; and members Dr. Lynna Ausburn, and Dr. Robert Nolan. Thank you for advising and guiding me through this journey. Also special thanks to Dr. Joan Warren for introducing me to the academia. This dissertation is dedicated in loving memory of my respectable father, Sheng-Chi Ho. Although my father did not live to see me fulfill his dream, his support and encouragement brought me to this point and will accompany with my children. I would like to thank my mother; Yu-Show Chang, she and my father always provide me with invaluable support and encouragement throughout this journey. To my brother, Kermit Ho, <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> care of our parents during these difficult times. Also I would like to acknowledge and thank my lovely wife Una Lee, without your support an...|$|E
40|$|First, I {{would like}} to thank my wife, Misha, who has been the {{foundation}} that supported me through most of my graduate career. Graduate school requires many sacrifices, and while this work is mine, the effort is ours. When I needed help she was there, and when I needed a smack on the head, she gave it to me. <b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> this journey with me. I {{would like to}} thank my mother, Charlene, for all of her support. Beyond making sure that I survived childhood, she fostered my interest in the sciences and taught me from early on the importance of knowledge and independence. I {{would like to thank}} my father, John, for his do-it-yourself attitude. I learned more than he knows from handing him his tools as a child. To my brother Matt, thanks for being different from me (and sometimes annoyingly similar). Sometimes diversity of opinion is a good thing. Sometimes. I {{would also like to thank}} my grandmother, Grace; there’s a strong independent streak in my family, and I have a suspicion that she has a lot to do with it. I would like to thank my advisor, Manos Tentzeris. Without Manos, I quite literally would not have made it through grad school. I couldn’t afford it (also, I’d like t...|$|E
40|$|God, I {{thank you}} for giving me the ability and {{determination}} to become a scientist. You could have taken me so many times, and for that I’m convinced I’m here for a real reason. Robin, I can’t thank you enough for helping to turn my mind to the Most High. To my family, I love you ALL!! Mom and Grama, without you I would be nowhere. Dad, I’m glad I decided to forgive you…I love you. Chris and Kelly, what can I say, just keep doing your thing, you will find your treasures in due time. Amber, I’m just glad we met. We went through so much together, it’s amazing we’re still close. I will always be here for you…anything you need I will do my best to provide. Because of you I know what unconditional love is. As for everyone at IBB: Suzy, <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> a chance on me. It’s been hard at times, but I’m a better person for going through graduate school. To my committee, thanks for having faith in me. You all could have kicked me out after that first candidacy exam, but you saw some potential in me. I don’t think I’ve fully realized the potential and when I do it’s going to be a sight to behold. Vicki, you were a grea...|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} morning, {{everyone says}} their goodbyes to Bob. Bob <b>thanks</b> Rick <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> {{him into the}} prison and giving him a home. He dies in Sasha's arms, and Tyreese stabs {{him in the head}} to spare his sister's emotions. The group buries Bob outside the church alongside Gabriel's parishioners.

Abraham, Eugene Porter (Josh McDermitt), Rosita Espinosa (Christian Serratos), Glenn, Maggie, and Tara drive off in the repaired bus. Rick reads a message from Abraham on the map, imploring him to come to Washington. Rick then helps Tyreese bury The Hunters and asks about his journey to Terminus. Tyreese claims the experience killed him, but Rick reminds him it didn't.|$|R

He answers the call, and is shocked to recognize the voice as his father's (Harry). Harry tells Adrian that he, his friend Tony (whose left arm is in a sling) and several others survived the megatsunami and are shipwrecked on an island. Adrian informs Captain Michaels of this and the Ark heads <b>for</b> them. Kate <b>thanks</b> Laura <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> care of Lilly, and Laura tells Jackson that she enjoyed his book. Jackson returns Noah's cell phone, which he recovered during the Ark 4 flood. Lilly says that she sees an island, and the ark finds the shipwrecked cruise ship Genesis and her survivors on a beach.|$|R
40|$|I feel {{as though}} I have just reached the peak of Mount Everest. Its {{hard to believe that}} Im really at this point when it seems like its been ages that Ive been {{climbing}} this mountain. But I know that I would not be here except for the help of some very special people. First of all, I would like to thank my guides on this expedition: Sterling, you have supported me and this research from the beginning. Thank you for making yourself available to me despite your busy schedule. Your feedback and encouragement has been more valuable to me than you will ever know. Tom, as the resident expert on all things qualitative, your input was especially valuable. <b>Thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> the time to make sure I was doing this right. Nichole, thank you for all of your uplifting comments and great feedback. Dr. McGovern, every time I bumped into you in the hall at the HSC, you greeted me with a smile and a word of motivation. I know that this project would not be what it is without all of your contributions. I also need to thank the other professors and mentors who helped me {{at the beginning of this}} journey. Most of you have been called elsewhere and so I was no...|$|E
40|$|First and foremost, I {{would like}} to thank my wife, Abaynesta, for her support and encouragement. Undertaking a {{full-time}} graduate degree while maintaining full-time employment and trying to be a full-time husband would have been an impossible challenge without your love, patience, and understanding. I love you. To my supervisor, Dr. Jörg Kienzle, I {{would like to}} express my <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> on a student with a research area only somewhat related to your own, Software Fault Tolerance, and granting me the latitude to freely explore massively multiplayer game infrastructure. In the course of pursuing my graduate degree and writing this thesis, I was employed by two supportive organizations. To the management of Zero-Knowledge Systems Inc., most notably co-founders Austin Hill and Hammie Hill, I express my profound gratitude for your support and encouragement to pursue my academic goals. Thank you for allowing me the flexibility of schedule to take on a full-time course load and for your understanding and encouragement when the time came for me to move on to other opportunities. I {{would also like to thank}} the management of the Ubi. com group at Ubisoft Entertainment Inc. for recognizing the potential of this graduate student with no direct gaming experience and giving me the opportunity to learn from and contribute to your game projects while completing my thesis. ii TABLE OF CONTENTS ACKNOWLEDGMENTS [...] . i...|$|E
40|$|Firstly, before {{anything}} else, I’d {{like to thank}} Jesus Christ. This degree, my job, my wife, my family … they were all His ideas. My greatest hope is that He will be pleased with all that I have done with what He gave me. Next, I’d like to thank my wife Maryanne. I love her more every day, and even though we’re still just starting what will hopefully be a long road together, being with her it feels like we’ve been friends forever. Thank you for being my support {{every day of the}} week. (Also, thanks for watching baby Hannah all day while I’m gone doing research! I like to come home and just be the “fun parent”.) I’ve already dedicated this work to my parents, but I feel that they deserve extra <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> me {{all the way to the}} doorstep of reality before I took my first steps into the “grown-up ” world. All of my work ethic and determination comes from seeing both my parents push themselves towards excellence all my life. Greg Durgin has been an incredible advisor so far in my graduate career. He is ever the cheerleader for his students and a true master at helping fragile ideas blossom into great research. I hope to someday be an equally energetic and caring advisor for students of my own. Now to thank all my friends at Motorola! First, I have to say thanks to the whol...|$|E

However, Jesse crumbles it up and throws it onto the pavement, dismissing it as [...] "skunk-weed anyway." [...] Walter suffers a coughing attack while driving and coughs up blood. As he pulls into a gas station, he notices Ken pull up (his car being readily identifiable by the personalized license plate [...] "KEN WINS").
