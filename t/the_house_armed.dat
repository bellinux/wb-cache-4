In February 1949, Saville updated <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Armed</b> Services Committee on the necessity of radar air defense, and in March the Lashup plan was approved by Congress.|$|E

5|$|Kinkaid {{returned}} to the United States to replace Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary as Commander Eastern Sea Frontier and Commander Sixteenth Fleet, making {{his home in the}} historic Quarters A, Brooklyn Navy Yard. He served on a board chaired by Fleet Admiral Halsey which also included Admirals Spruance, Towers and Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher, whose task was to nominate 50 of the 215 serving rear admirals for early retirement. Kinkaid was soon facing this fate himself, when <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>Armed</b> Services Committee sought {{to reduce the number of}} four-star rank officers in 1947. Kinkaid was one of three admirals, the others being Spruance and Hewitt, who would have to retire or be reduced in rank to rear admiral. After some lobbying, this was averted, and they were permitted to remain in the grade until 1 July 1950, past Kinkaid's retirement age. Retirement ceremonies, including a parade through New York City, were held on 28 April 1950 and Kinkaid formally retired two days later.|$|E
