However, on 20 November 2012, the Tribunal ruled in favour of Rangers. If that decision is upheld the tax bill could be significantly reduced from an estimated £74m to under £2m. An Upper Tribunal upheld the decision in 2014. HMRC then appealed to the Court of Session, which ruled in November 2015 that Rangers should have paid tax and national insurance on the EBT payments.|$|E

The study examined the impacts of both psychological (credit attitudes and perception of future income) and socioeconomic variables on <b>total</b> <b>debt,</b> <b>total</b> <b>debt</b> payment and patterns of debt payments;A conceptual model for this study was developed by incorporating the theory of borrower risk, the economic and psychological economic theory of borrowing, and the results of previous studies. This model identifies socioeconomic and psychological variables that influence <b>total</b> <b>debt,</b> <b>total</b> <b>debt</b> payment, and patterns of debt payments. Socioeconomic variables included in the model are gender, race, marital status, employment status, household size, age, education, and household assets. Psychological variables are credit attitudes toward the use of credit, and perception of future income;This study used data from the 1989 Survey of Consumer Finances.

Secondly, the <b>total</b> <b>debt</b> ratio (bank loan ratio) had a stronger negative impact on low-growth companies than on high-growth companies, implying that the <b>total</b> <b>debt</b> ratio (bank loan ratio) actually restrained companies from overinvestment.

This study uses pecking order theory as the basic theory. The short term debt and long term debt are chosen {{as the dependent variable}} as it’s being a development of the former research which has much focused on the <b>total</b> <b>debt</b> only. By using the purposive sampling method, samples of 745 firms are selected due to its consistency of publishing financial reporting on the BEI.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present thesis is to examine the dynamic {{interactions}} between <b>total</b> <b>debt</b> and GDP. In particular, the growth rates are studied in real terms. <b>Total</b> <b>debt</b> is defined as the sum of credit market liabilities of household, business, financial, foreign, federal government, state government and local government sectors. The methodology of this study is based on time-series regression analysis, in which a structural VAR model is estimated. Then, the dynamic interactions are studied with Granger causality tests, impulse response functions and forecast error variance decompositions. The data is based on the United States from 1959 to 2010 and it is organized quarterly. The main finding {{of this study is that}} real <b>total</b> <b>debt</b> growth affects real GDP growth, but there is no feedback from real GDP growth to real <b>total</b> <b>debt</b> growth. The response of real GDP growth to a shock in real <b>total</b> <b>debt</b> growth seems to be transitory, but the level effect might be persistent. In both cases the effect is in the same direction. Thus, a positive shock in the growth rate of real <b>total</b> <b>debt</b> has a transitory positive effect on real GDP growth rate, but may have a persistent positive effect on the level of real GDP. The results of this study imply that economic growth typically requires accumulating <b>total</b> <b>debt.</b> In other words, economic growth is very difficult to achieve when <b>total</b> <b>debt</b> is reduced. At the time being, the private sector of the United States is already heavily indebted and, hence, it seems likely that it is unwilling or unable to accumulate more debt. Consequently, during a recession the public sector should borrow to stimulate the economy and enhance the repayment ability of the private sector. Furthermore, the United States can be considered as a financially sovereign country, which does not face an income constraint, it can also clear all its debt obligations at any given time and, thus, it cannot drift into insolvency. However, present financial institutions set constraints for public borrowing especially in Europe. Consequently, there might be a need to redesign European institutions in order to facilitate public borrowing...|$|R

40|$|The article aims to {{investigate}} {{some of the}} important factors contributing to the fiscal deficit in Pakistan {{for the period of}} 1976 to 2010. International trade, economic growth, <b>total</b> <b>debt</b> servicing and broad money supply are considered as foremost factors affecting fiscal deficit in Pakistan.

Whereas, all other factors such as international trade, <b>total</b> <b>debt</b> servicing and broad money supply affect fiscal deficit significantly in both short run {{as well as in the}} long run. Moreover, it is found that there exists univariate Granger causality which runs from economic growth to fiscal deficit, from <b>total</b> <b>debt</b> servicing to fiscal deficit, and there exists bivariate causality between money supply and fiscal deficit in the short run.

40|$|The optimal {{outcome of}} a firm in {{bankruptcy}} is to liquidate if its asset value is greater than its value as a going concern or, alternatively, to reorganize if it is worth more as a going concern.

We find two key factors influencing the success of a bankruptcy: the ratio of the firm’s accounts receivable to its <b>total</b> <b>debt,</b> and the ratio of its accounts payable to <b>total</b> <b>debt.</b> Controlling for size, the probability of a firm successfully reorganizing is found to be positively related to the ratio of accounts receivable to <b>total</b> <b>debt,</b> and negatively related to the ratio of accounts payable to <b>total</b> <b>debt.</b> The evidence indicates that accounts receivable are a valuable source of cash to pay creditors in bankruptcy, and that trade creditors may be more supportive of liquidation than other creditors even though liquidation eliminates the opportunity to conduct future business with the firm...|$|R
