Bulls can weigh up to 800kilograms (1,800 pounds) and cows up to 500kilograms (1,100 pounds). Their milk {{generally}} has a very high butterfat content, and their meat, regarded as of <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>quality,</b> is gaining mainstream acceptance as it is lower in cholesterol than other varieties of beef.|$|E

40|$|We {{formulate}} {{a model of}} vertical differentiation to evaluate the welfare effects of removing a low quality product from the market. The mechanism through which a welfare improvement might arise is simple: Once the low quality low cost alternative is banned, entry into <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> segment becomes more likely. This in turn {{may lead to a}} significant reduction in the price of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> product. We find that such a ban might improve aggregate welfare when consumers value <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>quality</b> more, <b>the</b> marginal cost of producing <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> is lower, <b>the</b> price of low <b>quality</b> is <b>higher,</b> and <b>the</b> price sensitivity for <b>high</b> <b>quality</b> is not too high...|$|R
5|$|Colonists {{near the}} shores in New England often dined on fish, {{crustaceans}} and other sea animals. Colonists ate {{large quantities of}} turtle, a delicacy also exportable to Europe. Cod was enjoyed in both fresh and salted form, salted cod being suitable for long-term storage. Lobsters proliferated in the waters as well, and were commonplace in the New England diet. Some complained about dining on lobster and codfish too often and they were even used as pig fodder. <b>The</b> <b>highest</b> <b>quality</b> cod was usually dried and salted, however, and exported to the Mediterranean in exchange for fruits not grown in American colonies.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>highest</b> <b>quality</b> {{evidence}} indicates that circumcision does not decrease {{the sensitivity of the}} penis, harm sexual function or reduce sexual satisfaction. A 2013 systematic review found that circumcision did not appear to adversely affect sexual desire, pain with intercourse, premature ejaculation, time until ejaculation, erectile dysfunction or difficulties with orgasm. However, the study found that the existing evidence is not very good. Another 2013 systematic review found that the highest-quality studies reported no adverse effects of circumcision on sexual function, sensitivity, sensation or satisfaction. A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis found that circumcision did not affect premature ejaculation.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} use of textiles results from their portability; tapestries provided easily assembled interior decorations suited to religious or civic ceremonies.

White and gold were considered of <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>quality.</b> Charles V of France had 57 tapestries, of which 16 were white. Jean de Berry owned 19, while Mary of Burgundy, Isabella of Valois, Isabeau of Bavaria and Philip the Good all held substantial collections.|$|E

5|$|After the 1841 general election, Melbourne was {{replaced}} as Prime Minister by Sir Robert Peel, who appointed Albert {{as chairman of}} the Royal Commission in charge of redecorating the new Palace of Westminster. The Palace had burned down seven years before, and was being rebuilt. As a patron and purchaser of pictures and sculpture, the commission was set up to promote the fine arts in Britain. The commission's work was slow, and the architect, Charles Barry, took many decisions out of the commissioners' hands by decorating rooms with ornate furnishings that were treated as part of the architecture. Albert was more successful as a private patron and collector. Among his notable purchases were early German and Italian paintings—such as Lucas Cranach the Elder's Apollo and Diana and Fra Angelico's St Peter Martyr—and contemporary pieces from Franz Xaver Winterhalter and Edwin Landseer. , of Dresden, assisted Albert in buying pictures of <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>quality.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Zayat Stables' horses Bodemeister {{and then}} Paynter ran second {{in each of}} the three legs of the Triple Crown. Bodemeister {{finished}} a narrow second place in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes to I'll Have Another. Switching horses in the 2012 Belmont Stakes, Zayat's colt Paynter also finished second. Paynter went on to win the Grade I Haskell Invitational but shortly thereafter developed near-fatal complications from colitis and laminitis. Zayat authorized <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>quality</b> of care for the horse, and following abdominal surgery and several months of rehabilitation, Paynter successfully returned to racing in 2013. After Zayat and his son Justin began making regular social media updates on Twitter with the hashtag #PowerUpPaynter, the horse developed a significant fan base, and received hundreds of get well cards, many from children. For his struggle to return to health, Paynter won NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award.|$|E
5|$|To age the notes, between 40 and 50 prisoners {{stood in}} two columns {{and passed the}} notes among them to {{accumulate}} dirt, sweat and general wear and tear. Some of the prisoners would fold and refold the notes, others would pin the corners to replicate how a bank clerk would collect bundles of notes. British names and addresses were written on the reverse, as happened with some English notes, and numbers were written on the front – duplicating how a bank teller would mark {{the value of a}} bundle. Four grades of note quality were introduced: grade 1 was <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>quality,</b> to be used in neutral countries and by Nazi spies; grade 2 was to be used to pay collaborators; grade 3 was for notes that were to be possibly dropped over Britain; grade 4 were too flawed to be of use and were destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Christianity {{discouraged}} {{the burial}} of grave goods so {{the majority of}} examples of insular metalwork that survive from the Christian period {{have been found in}} archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned. There are a few exceptions, notably portable shrines ("cumdachs") for books or relics, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent—though the Monymusk Reliquary has always been in Scotland. <b>The</b> <b>highest</b> <b>quality</b> survivals are either secular jewellery, the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers, tableware or altarware. The finest church pieces were probably made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops. There are a number of large brooches, each of their designs is wholly individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied. Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts. Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with amber and rock crystal among the commonest, and some garnets. Coloured glass, enamel and millefiori glass, probably imported, are also used. None of the major insular manuscripts, like the Book of Kells, have preserved their elaborate jewelled metal covers, but documentary evidence indicates that these were as spectacular as the few remaining continental examples.|$|E
5|$|The 1971 Five Nations Championship {{was a new}} dawn for Welsh rugby. The new National Stadium was completed, and {{the team}} now into their Second Golden era were both {{experienced}} and talented. John and Edwards played in all four games, starting with an easy win over England. Wales won 22–6, with John scoring six points from two dropped goals. The second game of the Championship, played against Scotland, was a close encounter, won by Wales 19–18 thanks to a late Gerald Davies try converted by John Taylor. Barry John scored eight of Wales' points, with a try, penalty goal and a conversion; missing only his trademark drop goal to complete a full house of scores. John surpassed his Scotland tally in the next match, a home game against Ireland, scoring 11points with a dropped goal, conversion and two penalty goals. Seen as one of Wales' more accomplished victories, the 23–0 win gave the team a Triple Crown title, {{and set up a}} Grand Slam encounter with France. Despite the low score, the 9–5 win over France at Stade Colombes on 27 March was a match of <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>quality.</b> Edwards and John scored all the points in the encounter, Edwards with a try, John a try and a penalty goal. This was Wales' first Grand Slam since 1952 and the 1971 squad is seen as the greatest ever to be fielded by Wales.|$|E
