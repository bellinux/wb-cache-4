25|$|Furthermore, {{although}} the Amusement Area {{was supposed to}} remain open for four hours after the exhibits closed at 10pm, the fair presented a fountain-and-fireworks show every night at 9pm at the Pool of Industry. Fairgoers would see this show and then leave the fair rather than head to the Amusement Area; one was hard pressed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> on the fairgrounds by midnight.|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{production}} of Half-Blood Prince, Watson considered not returning, but eventually decided that [...] "the pluses outweighed the minuses" [...] and {{that she could not}} bear <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> else play Hermione.|$|E
2500|$|Few {{lawmakers are}} as honest, principled and {{consistent}} as Brinkman. But he exhibits those qualities to a fault, coming off as stubborn, ideologically rigid {{and unwilling to}} compromise. He's made many enemies in Columbus by refusing <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> else's side of things. This has limited his ability to work with others and get things done. [...] Brinkman won the March 2 primary: [...] 7,113 (63.00%) to 4,178 (37.00%).|$|E
60|$|And {{he looked}} nervously round <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if <b>anyone</b> was within earshot.|$|R
50|$|Sundown - Last {{phase in}} the turn, where you check <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if <b>anyone</b> has won.|$|R
50|$|Horace - Horace {{was once}} an arch enemy of Will's; every moment he had been picking on Will for his dream of being a Knight. Since he went to battle school he has learned many things {{and has become a}} close friend of Will's, {{accompanying}} him on some missions and attempting to save him when he and the King's Daughter, Cassandra (Evanlyn), were taken captive by the Skandians. Horace also gains the honour and valour of a knight, and is appalled <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone's</b> disrespect or lack of chivalry.|$|R
2500|$|Emma Watson {{considered}} not returning for the film, {{but eventually}} decided that, [...] "the pluses outweighed the minuses," [...] {{and could not}} bear <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> else play Hermione. Composer Nicholas Hooper returned from the last film; he included a reworking of John Williams's Hedwig's Theme, which has recurred in all scores. Also maintained were costume designer Jany Temime, visual effects supervisor Tim Burke, creature and make-up effects designer Nick Dudman, and special effects supervisor John Richardson from the third film.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{hearing in}} Cochin {{of the death}} of his only son, Dom Francisco de Almeida was heart-striken, and retired to his {{quarters}} for three days, unwilling <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone.</b> The presence of a Mamluk fleet in India posed a grave threat to the Portuguese, but the viceroy now sought to personally exact revenge for the death of his son at the hands of Mirocem, supposedly having said that [...] "he who ate the chick must also eat the rooster or pay for it".|$|E
60|$|To his {{surprise}} {{he saw that}} she was crying. He had a tender heart, and hated <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> miserable.|$|E
50|$|Harley {{sometimes}} deliberately misspelled words <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{how many}} phone calls the tobacco company would get about it. He {{had said that}} once in a while, he put three 'C's in 'TOBACCO' just <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if <b>anyone</b> noticed.|$|R
50|$|Horace - Horace {{was once}} Will's arch enemy; he always picked on Will {{because he wanted}} to be a Knight. Since he went to battle school he has learned many things and has become a close friend of Will's, {{accompanying}} him on some missions and attempting to save him when he and the King's Daughter, Cassandra (Evanlyn), were taken captive by the Skandians. Horace also gains the honour and valor of a knight, and is appalled <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone's</b> disrespect or lack of chivalry. Horace is also very talented with the sword, defeating many inexperienced knights along the way to Skandia.|$|R
5000|$|Susan {{bought a}} movie ticket 15 minutes ago, but she now feels dizzy and can't watch the film. She sends out {{messages}} to {{people around the}} cinema <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if <b>anyone</b> will purchase her ticket at 50 percent off.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come with us quickly," [...] cried Erling; [...] "we do {{not wish}} the King's people <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> on this mound. Let me lead thee down, Hilda." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{should like}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> {{talking about an}} arrest out there. However, I don't think you need be afraid of him; I fancy I can arrange about that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> {{unjustly}} treated," [...] declared Nan, [...] "and {{that is what}} you've been. You've {{never had}} half a chance. And after the way you've slaved, too!" ...|$|E
50|$|Later in Galway, {{he tries}} {{his hand at}} busking and, singing the filthiest, most debauched lyrics he can think of <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if <b>anyone</b> will understand, old ladies smile and tap their feet merrily as he serenades them with filth.|$|R
60|$|It {{looked so}} strange, there in public, {{on the walls}} of the Castle gallery, where in her {{lifetime}} she had seen so many pictures. And she glanced round <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if <b>anyone</b> had noticed her again in front of the same sketch.|$|R
50|$|Some {{computer}} monitors are fitted with rear-view mirrors <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if <b>anyone</b> is positioned behind the user {{where they can}} see sensitive information, such as names and passwords, being keyed in or on the screen. These are used especially on automated teller machines and similar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Poirot," [...] I exclaimed, with relief, and seizing him by both hands, I {{dragged him}} into the room. [...] "I was never so glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone.</b> Listen, I have said nothing to anybody but John. Is that right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Again he pondered. It {{was very}} {{important}} to explain exactly why; his feelings about everything were concerned in this. And while he mused she gazed at him, as if surprised <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> think so deeply. At last he said: ...|$|E
60|$|But {{paralyzed by}} unaccountable discretion, Mrs. Septimus Small let fall no word, neither did she {{question}} June about him. In desperation the girl asked at last whether Soames and Irene were in town--she {{had not yet}} been <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone.</b>|$|E
50|$|In November 1972 {{when local}} {{resident}} Tommy Vance decided to advertise {{in the local}} paper <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if <b>anyone</b> was interested in forming a soccer club, he could never have imagined what that simple decision would mean, and how many peopleâ€™s lives would be altered by it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I fail <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that <b>anyone</b> is <b>to</b> blame. I {{can hardly}} {{see how the}} lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of doing it was {{undoubtedly}} to be regretted. Having no mother, she {{had no one to}} advise her at such a crisis." ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{two girls}} were not wishing <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> in particular, on this occasion, but merely enjoyed {{watching}} the shifting scenes, {{some of which}} were exceedingly curious and remarkable. Suddenly Dorothy exclaimed: [...] "Why, there's Button-Bright!" [...] and this drew Ozma also to look at the picture, for she and Dorothy knew the boy well.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{hope she}} has come, for, when I {{make an effort}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone,</b> I hate {{to make it in}} vain. Punctuality is such a virtue, and I know this woman hasn't got it, for she promised to be here at seven, and now it is long after," [...] began Mrs. Coventry, in an injured tone.|$|E
60|$|As {{he wandered}} he chanced to see Miss Price sitting by herself on a bench. He hesitated, for {{he did not}} at that moment want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone,</b> and her uncouth way seemed out of place amid the {{happiness}} he felt around him; but he had divined her sensitiveness to affront, and since {{she had seen him}} thought it would be polite to speak to her.|$|E
5000|$|In 2015, OTX 2.0 added {{a social}} network which enables members to share, discuss and {{research}} security threats, including via a real-time threat feed.

50|$|La France juive {{became a}} major success and {{achieved}} great fame. Its success was {{due in part to}} the inclusion of a list of names of famous people against whom the author made accusations in the book. Many buyers were inspired by curiosity <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if <b>anyone</b> they knew appeared on the list.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Me? I ain't got nothin' ter speak abaht, thet I knows of,' {{answered}} Polly, abruptly walking off. Liza grew very red {{and quickly}} looked <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if <b>anyone</b> had noticed the incident. A couple of youths, {{sitting on the}} pavement, had seen it, and she saw them nudge one another and wink.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I {{suppose he}} will find Kansas for you. But first you must get to see him, {{and that will be}} a hard task; for the Great Wizard does not like <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone,</b> and he usually has his own way. But what do YOU want?" [...] he continued, {{speaking}} to Toto. Toto only wagged his tail; for, strange to say, he could not speak.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dan Phillips," [...] he ejaculated, [...] "have you plum {{gone out}} of your mind? Boy alive, you needn't be afraid that I'd peach on you. I'm too blamed glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> {{get the better of}} that old Walters, smart as he thinks himself. Gee! To dream of going to him and telling him you've been fishing in his pond! Why, he'll put you in jail. You don't know what sort of a man he is. Dad says--" ...|$|E
60|$|When we went {{again to}} the {{hospital}} we saw a nursing sister. She told us that Blanche seemed a little better, and she went in to ask if she would see her husband. We heard voices in the room in which she lay, and presently the nurse returned {{to say that the}} patient refused <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>anyone.</b> We had told her that if she refused to see Dirk the nurse was to ask if she would see me, but this she refused also. Dirk's lips trembled.|$|E
50|$|The course, a par 73, {{measures}} 6748 yards. Edward Ryder and Val Carlson {{are credited}} as its designers. Perhaps 20 foursomes play per day, although regulars {{on the nearby}} public course claim <b>to</b> have never <b>seen</b> <b>anyone</b> on the greens.|$|R
6000|$|Anne {{had gone}} {{to write a letter}} in her mother's room, whilst Elizabeth was busy. She had just {{finished}} it, and was thinking of going <b>to</b> <b>see</b> whether <b>anyone</b> was ready to read in the school-room, when Rupert came in, and making a low bow, addressed her thus: 'So, Miss Nancy, I congratulate you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must think}} it over," [...] Walter rejoined; [...] "where {{there is a}} will there is a way, you know. We will take it by turns to watch that little patch of light overhead; if we <b>see</b> <b>anyone</b> looking down we must leave the bucket and swim to the side without making the least noise. They may give a few turns of the {{windlass}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> if <b>anyone</b> has hold of the rope below; be sure you do not make the slightest splashing or noise, for the sound would be heard above to a certainty." ...|$|R
