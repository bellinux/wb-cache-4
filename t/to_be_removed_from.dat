5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also reduces silica {{which has}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the pig iron. The silica is reacted with calcium oxide (burned limestone) and forms a slag which floats {{to the surface}} of the molten pig iron. The direct contact of flue gas with the iron causes contamination with sulfur if it is present in the fuel. Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.|$|E
5|$|Intended for express {{passenger}} trains on the Edinburgh–Glasgow, Edinburgh–Carlisle, and Burntisland–Dundee routes, they handled these well. When trains from London to Edinburgh {{began to be}} forwarded via Carlisle over the NBR in mid-1876, these heavier trains were beyond the locomotives' capabilities, and they had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> front-line service on the Carlisle line. Rebuilt between 1885 and 1897, they remained in service until 1914–19.|$|E

5|$|Moscoso {{worked to}} end Panama's role in {{international}} crime, passing new laws against money laundering and supporting tax transparency. The legislation allowed Panama <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> international lists of tax havens. Meanwhile, violent crime rose sharply during Moscoso's tenure. In September 2000, {{under pressure from}} the US and some Latin American governments, Moscoso's government gave temporary asylum to former Peruvian spy chief Vladimiro Montesinos, who had fled Peru after being videotaped bribing a member of its congress.|$|E

5|$|Williams' premiership was {{considered}} controversial outside of Newfoundland and Labrador. Events such as ordering all Canadian flags <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> provincial government buildings, and launching the Anything But Conservative {{campaign in the}} 2008 federal election, garnered national attention. While Williams remains a controversial politician outside Newfoundland and Labrador, he was continuously ranked {{as one of the}} most popular premiers in Canada, with approval ratings in the province consistently in the high seventies and eighties.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its effects}} in the United States, the name Frances was retired {{in the spring of}} 2005 by the World Meteorological Organization, and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane. It was {{replaced}} with Fiona for the 2010 season. Due to a request by France in the 2003 WMO Meeting, the name Frances was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the rotating cyclone lists after the 2004 hurricane season, even if Frances wasn't as destructive, but the destruction caused by Frances in the United States was enough to warrant retirement on its own merit.|$|E

5|$|In 1553, {{orders were}} issued for the {{artillery}} pieces <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> Gravesend Blockhouse {{and taken to}} the Tower of London, although the historian Victor Smith casts doubt on whether this was actually carried out. In 1588, however, there was a renewed threat of invasion, this time from Spain; the Spanish Armada sailed from A Coruña, while a separate invasion force was prepared in Flanders, threatening London; Rober Dudley, the Earl of Leicester {{was put in charge}} of the defences along the Thames.|$|E
5|$|In 1553, {{orders were}} issued for the {{artillery}} pieces <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the blockhouse {{and taken to}} the Tower of London; the fort was then demolished between 1557 and 1558, the brick and stone from the site being reused to repair the Tower. The former site was probably rediscovered during excavations in 1826, but was destroyed during {{the building of the}} Gravesend Canal Basin, Canal Road and the Gordon Pleasure Gardens later in the 19th century. Archaeological investigations between 1973 and 1978 uncovered the foundations of the blockhouse, now protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years, British {{officials}} depended on native officials for advice {{and to act}} as interpreters. However, {{they had to be}} careful about ethnic rivalries. Thus Fadl el-Mula, a Dinka who had been a police quartermaster, greatly impressed the Governor of Mongalla and was appointed assistant superintendent of the Twic Dinka in 1909. He was credited with keeping the peace between the Dinka and the Nuer people, two groups with a history of fighting and cattle raiding. However, Fadl el-Mula was so strongly biased towards the Dinka that his police were attacked by angry Nuer and he had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> his post.|$|E

5|$|Quarrying {{was carried}} out in the castle grounds during the 18th century, and the {{gatehouse}} leading into the outer bailey was demolished to build a track for the stones <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the site. In 1840 the castle was purchased by John Tollemache, 1st Baron Tollemache, at that time the largest landowner in Cheshire, {{as part of a larger}} estate. In the mid-19th century the castle was the site of an annual two-day fete, raising money for local widows and orphans and attracting more than 3000 visitors a day.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{evacuated}} 21 T-55 tanks, nine T-34s, an armoured recovery vehicle, an armoured vehicle-launched bridge, ten APCs (including an armoured command vehicle) and 50 vehicles carrying military equipment. Elements of the 110th Infantry Brigade {{entered the}} Logorište barracks {{on the morning}} of 6 November, removing some of the military hardware in the barracks before pulling out at 1:00p.m. after being informed that the JNA was planning an artillery attack. Captured equipment continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the barracks until 13 November.|$|E
5|$|The {{cease-fire}} agreement {{also provided}} for the evacuation of the JNA Zadar garrison. The evacuation, encompassing six barracks and 3,750 people, began on 11 October and took 15 days to complete. The JNA removed 2,1902,250 truckloads of weapons and equipment and the personal effects of JNA personnel and their families. Evacuated personnel and equipment were required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> Croatian soil; the JNA complied, except for its artillery (which was primarily left for the SAO Krajina TO). The JNA also transferred 20 truckloads of weapons to the SAO Krajina TO in the area. On 18 October, the ZNG Independent BenkovacStaknovci Battalion merged with the 1st Battalion of the 112th Brigade to create the 134th Infantry Brigade.|$|E
