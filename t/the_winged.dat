On 28 September 1633, Commonwealth forces took the main Russian supply points, and by 4 October the siege had broken.|$|E
5|$|Fortune saw her occult novels as an {{important}} part of her Fraternity work, initiating readers into the realms of occultism by speaking to their subconscious, even when their conscious mind rejects occult teachings. She thus perceived them as a means of disseminating her teachings to a wider audience.

5|$|A {{prominent}} predator is the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) that {{eats the}} virgin queens during nuptial flight {{due to their}} high percentage of fat. Echidnas do not consume Iridomyrmex ants all year; instead, they usually attack nests during August to October, which is when <b>the</b> <b>winged</b> females and males, known as alates emerge from their nest. Queens will also face more threats during nuptial flight or after; birds such as currawongs, magpies and ravens, attracted by recently excavated soil, will dig out nests shortly after the queens have founded their colonies. Parasitic flatworms in the class Cestoda are known to infect Iridomyrmex.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 she {{published}} {{her second}} occult novel, <b>The</b> <b>Winged</b> Bull—which was again reviewed in The Times Literary Review—and in 1936 her third, The Goat-Foot God. In 1938 Fortune wrote a fourth occult novel, The Sea Priestess, which was eventually self-published through the Fraternity after being declined by Williams and Norgate, who had published the previous two. Her final novel, Moon Magic, was apparently left unfinished {{prior to the}} outbreak of the Second World War; a protégé later completed it, claiming to have done so through channeling Blavatsky's disembodied spirit, and it was published posthumously.|$|E

5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made that wings may have evolved {{initially}} for sailing {{on the surface of}} water as seen in some stoneflies. An alternative idea is that it drives from directed aerial gliding descent—a preflight phenomena found in some apterygote, a wingless sister taxa to <b>the</b> <b>winged</b> insects. The earliest fliers were similar to dragonflies with two sets of wings, direct flight muscles, and no ability to fold their wings over their abdomens. Most insects today, which evolved from those first fliers, have simplified to either one pair of wings or two pairs functioning as a single pair and using a system of indirect flight muscles.|$|E
5|$|The archaic is {{demonstrated}} by jewellery and pieces such as the limestone Lady of Auxerre, from 640 BC; and the cylindrical Hera of Samos, circa 570–560BC. After the 4thcenturyBC, focus on the human form increased, exemplified by the Borghese Gladiator. The Louvre holds masterpieces from the Hellenistic era, including <b>The</b> <b>Winged</b> Victory of Samothrace (190BC) and the Venus de Milo, symbolic of classical art. The long Galerie Campana displays an outstanding {{collection of more than}} one thousand Greek potteries. In the galleries paralleling the Seine, much of the museum's Roman sculpture is displayed. The Roman portraiture is representative of that genre; examples include the portraits of Agrippa and Annius Verus; among the bronzes is the Greek Apollo of Piombino.|$|E

5|$|Despite its {{dominance}} among ants, {{a number}} of animals are known to prey on meat ants. The short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) is a prominent predator of the meat ant, mostly due to the high fat levels (up to 47%) in virgin queens. These queens can almost contain 47% fat, and when no queens are available after an attack, an echidna may stop attacking the nest. However, these ants are normally consumed either in low numbers or avoided entirely. Attacking echidnas burrow down into the hole they have made and consume them while handling the bites from the ants, as they frequently scratch themselves {{on the head and}} chest. The echidna does not consume meat ants throughout the whole year; instead, echidnas only attack meat ant nests from August to October, which is when nuptial flight (meaning that virgin queens and males emerge to mate) occurs. This time period makes it much easier for echidnas to prey on <b>the</b> <b>winged</b> females since they are directly above on the nest. Despite attacks, colony growth is not affected by echidnas.|$|E
5|$|Paleoptera and Neoptera are <b>the</b> <b>winged</b> {{orders of}} insects {{differentiated}} {{by the presence}} of hardened body parts called sclerites, and in the Neoptera, muscles that allow their wings to fold flatly over the abdomen. Neoptera can further be divided into incomplete metamorphosis-based (Polyneoptera and Paraneoptera) and complete metamorphosis-based groups. It has proved difficult to clarify the relationships between the orders in Polyneoptera because of constant new findings calling for revision of the taxa. For example, the Paraneoptera {{have turned out to be}} more closely related to the Endopterygota than to the rest of the Exopterygota. The recent molecular finding that the traditional louse orders Mallophaga and Anoplura are derived from within Psocoptera has led to the new taxon Psocodea. Phasmatodea and Embiidina have been suggested to form the Eukinolabia. Mantodea, Blattodea, and Isoptera are thought to form a monophyletic group termed Dictyoptera.|$|E
5|$|The adult {{stage of}} a caddisfly may only survive for a few weeks; many species do not feed as adults and die soon after breeding, but some species are known to feed on nectar. <b>The</b> <b>winged</b> insects are nocturnal and provide food for night-flying birds, bats, small mammals, {{amphibians}} and arthropods. The larval stage lasts much longer, often for one or more years, and has a bigger impact on the environment. They form {{an important part of}} the diet of fish such as the trout. The fish acquire them by two means, either plucking them off vegetation or the stream-bed as the larvae move about, or during the daily behavioural drift; this drift happens during the night for many species of aquatic larvae, or around midday for some cased caddisfly species, and may result from population pressures or be a dispersal device. The larvae may drift in great numbers either close to the bottom, in mid-water or just below the surface. The fish swallow them whole, case and all.|$|E

5|$|The {{recently}} built Battersea Power Station then dominated most {{views of}} the area, so {{it was decided that}} the bridge's appearance was unimportant. Consequently, in contrast to the heavily ornamented 1858 bridge, the new bridge has a starkly utilitarian design and the only ornamentation consists of two ornamental lamp posts at each entrance. Each features a gilded galleon on top of a coat of arms. The outward facing sides of all four posts show the LCC coat of arms of the Lion of England, St George's Cross and the barry wavy lines representing the Thames; the inward faces on the south side show the dove of peace of the Metropolitan Borough of Battersea, that on the northwest corner shows <b>the</b> <b>winged</b> bull, lion, boars' heads and stag of the Metropolitan Borough of Chelsea, and that on the northeast corner the portcullis and Tudor roses of the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{stage of}} the insect is <b>the</b> <b>winged</b> adult or imago. The surface of both butterflies and moths is covered by scales, {{each of which is}} an outgrowth from a single epidermal cell. The head is small and dominated by the two large compound eyes. These are capable of distinguishing flower shapes or motion but not for clearly viewing distant objects. Colour perception is good, especially in some species in the blue/violet range. The antennae are composed of many segments and have clubbed tips (unlike moths that have tapering or feathery antennae). The sensory receptors are concentrated in the tips and can detect odours. Taste receptors are located on the palps and on the feet. The mouthparts are designed for sucking and the mandibles are usually reduced in size or absent. The first maxillae are elongated into a tubular proboscis which is curled up at rest and expanded when needed to feed. The first and second maxillae bear palps which function as sensory organs. Some species have a reduced proboscis or maxillary palps and do not feed as adults.|$|E
5|$|Thrips are hemimetabolous, metamorphosing {{gradually}} to the adult form. The first two instars, called larvae or nymphs, are like small wingless adults (often confused with springtails) without genitalia; these feed on plant tissue. In the Terebrantia, {{the third and}} fourth instars, and in the Tubulifera also a fifth instar, are non-feeding resting stages similar to pupae: in these stages, the body's organs are reshaped, and wing-buds and genitalia are formed. The adult stage can be reached in around 8–15 days; adults can live for around 45 days. Adults have both winged and wingless forms; in the grass thrips Anaphothrips obscurus, for example, <b>the</b> <b>winged</b> form makes up 90% of the population in spring (in temperate zones), while the wingless form makes up 98% of the population late in the summer. Thrips can survive the winter as adults or through egg or pupal diapause.|$|E
