40|$|The {{breeding}} performance of higher predators {{has often been}} used to monitor fluctuations in the abundance of important prey stocks in marine ecosystems. The development of electronic data-loggers {{in recent years has}} also provided the opportunity of using wide-ranging marine animals to measure physical oceanographic conditions. In this study, time–depth recorders (TDRs) programmed to record temperature were deployed on female Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) at Bird Island, South Georgia (54 ° 00 ′S; 38 ° 02 ′W) during the breeding seasons 1994 to 1998. Temperature sensors had relatively slow response times, and thermal radiation errors occurred during the day when seals spent a large proportion of their time at the surface. Nevertheless, measurements provided temperature–depth profiles which were typical of the vertical stratification of the ocean. During the early stages of a foraging <b>trip</b> <b>temperature</b> increased, suggesting that fur seals travelled northwards from South Georgia towards the warmer waters of the Polar Front. In addition, higher temperatures were recorded by females that remained at sea for longer, implying that these individuals also travelled further. Mean sea-surface temperature (SST) increased from ∼ 1 to 4 [*]°C from December to March and agreed with SSTs from ship, buoy and satellite. Future studies on marine mammals which combine satellite tracking with oceanographic measurements are likely to provide valuable information on biophysical aspects of the ocean...|$|E

A theoretical background is given on the motion of the molecules in phase-space.

Starting from a pulsed supersonic expansion a package of neutral molecules can be decelerated, focused, cooled and confined using appropriately designed (time-varying) electric fields.

Current trajectories indicate the viability of deploying large-scale shared e-bike (e-bikeshare) systems in China. We employ a stated preference survey and multinomial logit to model the factors influencing the choice to switch from an existing transportation mode to bikeshare or e-bikeshare in Beijing. Demand is influenced by distinct sets of factors: the bikeshare choice is most sensitive to measures of effort and comfort while the e-bikeshare choice is more sensitive to user heterogeneities. Bikeshare demand is strongly negatively impacted by <b>trip</b> distance, <b>temperature,</b> precipitation, and poor air quality.

On the H-R diagram and the g-T diagram, the UCVs are far beyond the red edge of pulsational instability <b>trip.</b> Their effective <b>temperatures</b> are lower than 6700 K with periods {{in the range from}} 0. 09 to 0. 22 days. NDSTs have metallicity close to that of the Sun as expected, while UCVs are slightly metal poor than NDSTs. The two peaks on the distributions of the period and stellar atmospheric parameters are all caused by the existence of UCVs. When those UCVs are excluded, it is discovered that the effective temperature, the gravitational acceleration and the metallicity all are correlated with the pulsating period for NDSTs and their physical properties and evolutionary states are discussed. The detecting of those UCVs indicates that about 25 % of the known δ Scuti stars may be misclassified.

40|$|Reproductive {{investment}} {{during the}} chick-rearing period {{is an important}} contributor to lifetime fitness. Key to chick-rearing is the success of parental foraging, as food deliveries affect chick growth and survival up until fledging. For seabirds, oceanographic conditions including factors such as sea surface temperature are known to influence foraging decisions, but {{few studies have examined}} the physiological variables that might affect those decisions. We used global positioning systems (GPS), time-depth recorders (TDR), and physiological sampling techniques to explore links between ocean temperature, diving behavior, and foraging success in chick-rearing female macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus. We then explored correlations between these foraging variables and measures of individual physiological condition, specifically aerobic capacity (hematocrit) and metabolic state (corticosterone). In GPS-tracked penguins, 2 principal foraging tactics were observed: penguins made deep dives in cool, near-shore areas surrounding the breeding colony at Bird Island, South Georgia, or they traveled farther to dive shallower in warmer shelf-break areas. TDR-equipped penguins showed similar patterns. Blood sampling of TDR penguins at the onset of trips revealed strong positive correlations between hematocrit and the mean duration of foraging <b>trips,</b> the ocean <b>temperature</b> experienced during these trips, and the relative efficiency of foraging activity {{in terms of the number}} of foraging behaviors recorded per dive. These results suggest that aerobic capacity might be an important determinant of foraging trip range, as well as workload.

Design/methodology/approach: The tensile strength tests were performed at - 196, - 60 and 20 °C and Charpy Vsamples were broken at - 100, - 80, - 60, - 40, - 20 and 20 °C temperatures. The tensile strength TS, yield strengthYS, elongation A 5 and reduction of area RA were established from tensile experiments.

The first experiment involved allowing tigers access to an exercise pen for 0, 20, or 40 minutes a day, and other than rehearsals and performances, holding them {{for the remainder of the}} time in their homecages. The amounts of time spent pacing, lying, and standing and walking were quantified. Also, while in the exercise pen, the distance that the tigers traveled was recorded. This was replicated using a set of three tigers from two different circuses. While access to an exercise pen did not have a significant effect on pacing, there was an inverse relationship between distance traveled in the exercise pen and the amount of time spent pacing. Another part of this experiment involved holding a third set of three tigers from another circus in their homecages for 72 h without performances or allowance of an exercise pen. The amounts of time spent pacing, lying, and standing and walking were again quantified. Those tigers held for 72 h in their homecages without exercise paced two to three times as much as the tigers allowed exercise and performances.

40|$|Coastal ice {{includes}} {{the parts of}} the sea ice that are stressed and deformed by tidal motion; the ice foot (the inner part that is frozen to the ground) and the hinge zone (the zone where cracking occurs due to tidal elevation of the floating ice). This thesis presents in situ measurements of first-year coastal ice conducted in a sound close {{to the head of the}} fjord Van Mijenfjorden, Sval- bard, in the period between January and May 2014. During in total 6 field <b>trips</b> measurements of <b>temperature,</b> salinity, density, thickness and freeboard were done both on the coastal ice and on the free-floating ice. The latter was done at a point 200 m offshore. Temperature oscillations with periods similar to the tides and amplitudes up to 0. 5 ◦C were found inside the ice in the hinge zone during a 10 -days period, indicating a high permeability of the ice. Since the ice there was grounded at low tide and floating at high tide, the water level was constantly varying relative to the ice and could thereby drive a column of brine/seawater up and down through the ice cover. This observation corresponded well with the calculated average permeabilities, which were much higher before the temperature oscillations occurred (2. 3 · 10 − 11 m 2) than after they had disappeared (1. 1 · 10 − 11 m 2). Freeboard and surface water measurements discovered buckling of the ice in the lower parts of the hinge zone, which varied with the tide. In May, the ice was clearly buckled at high tide and stretched out at low tide. Creation of new ice inside the tidal cracks, caused by inflow of water during the tidal cycle, and thermal expansion are factors suggested to cause elongation of the ice sheet. Since the shortest distance between two points is a straight line, the ice is more likely to be buckled at high tide than at low tide when it is lowered in the middle of the sound. Maximum recorded amount of surface water was 18 cm, and through the season at least 20 cm of superimposed ice had been accumulating on the ice in the lower parts of the hinge zone. During cold periods, growth rates in the different parts of the ice varied; the ice foot was hardly growing at all, the free-floating ice was growing in moderate rates, whereas in the hinge zone the maximum growth was very high. The largest recorded ice thicknesses were 84 cm in the free-floating ice and 171 cm in the hinge zone. In the lower parts of the hinge zone the average ice temperatures were warmer than in the free-floating ice. Both the rapid growth and the temperature differences are expected to be caused by frequent flooding of the ice in the lower parts of the hinge zone, which often resulted in creation of a new layer of ice on top of the original layer. The release of latent heat connected to this process, in addition to direct heating by the warmer surface water, is believed to be the main reason for the warmer ice. Also along the shore, large spatial variations in ice thickness were observed; two shore- perpendicular sections going across the hinge zone, 11 m from each other, showed that the maximum ice thickness differed with 70 cm. Mean salinities in the ice foot were relatively low, varying from 0. 6 to 1. 2 ppm, whereas in the hinge zone they varied between 4. 9 and 7. 2 ppm. In the free-floating ice, average salinities between 4. 7 and 6. 6 ppm were recorded...|$|R
