25|$|Oral {{anticoagulants}} such as warfarin {{have been}} the mainstay of stroke prevention for over 50 years. However, several {{studies have shown that}} aspirin and antiplatelet drugs are highly effective in secondary prevention after a stroke or transient ischemic attack. Low doses of aspirin (for example 75–150mg) are as effective as high doses but have fewer side effects; the lowest effective dose remains unknown. Thienopyridines (clopidogrel, <b>ticlopidine)</b> might be slightly more effective than aspirin and have a decreased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, but are more expensive. Clopidogrel has less side effects than <b>ticlopidine.</b> Dipyridamole can be added to aspirin therapy to provide a small additional benefit, even though headache is a common side effect. Low-dose aspirin is also effective for stroke prevention after having a myocardial infarction.|$|E
25|$|Anticoagulants and anti-platelet {{agents are}} amongst the most {{commonly}} used medications. Anti-platelet agents include aspirin, dipyridamole, <b>ticlopidine,</b> clopidogrel, ticagrelor and prasugrel; the parenteral glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors are used during angioplasty. Of the anticoagulants, warfarin (and related coumarins) and heparin are {{the most commonly}} used. Warfarin affects the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (II, VII, IX, X) and protein C and protein S, whereas heparin and related compounds increase the action of antithrombin on thrombin and factor Xa. A newer class of drugs, the direct thrombin inhibitors, is under development; some members are already in clinical use (such as lepirudin). Also under development are other small molecular compounds that interfere directly with the enzymatic action of particular coagulation factors (e.g., rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban).|$|E

2500|$|Early {{difficulties}} with coronary stents included {{a risk of}} early thrombosis (clotting) resulting in occlusion of the stent. Coating stainless steel stents with other substances such as platinum or gold did not eliminate this problem. [...] High-pressure balloon expansion of the stent to ensure its full apposition to the arterial wall, combined with drug therapy using aspirin and another inhibitor of platelet aggregation (usually <b>ticlopidine</b> or clopidogrel) nearly eliminated this risk of early stent thrombosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ticlopidine</b> {{interacts with}} several classes of medications. It {{increases}} the antiplatelet effects of aspirin and other NSAIDs. Taking <b>ticlopidine</b> {{at the same}} time as antacids decreases the absorption of <b>ticlopidine.</b> <b>Ticlopidine</b> inhibits liver CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 and thus can affect blood levels of medications metabolized by these systems.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ticlopidine</b> was {{introduced}} to the United States under the trade name Ticlid by Roche after it was FDA approved in 1991. The first generic <b>ticlopidine</b> hydrochloride was FDA approved in 1999. [...] As of April 2015, Roche, Caraco, Sandoz, Par, Major, Apotex, and Teva had discontinued generic <b>ticlopidine</b> and no <b>ticlopidine</b> preparations were available in the US.|$|E
50|$|Use of <b>ticlopidine</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), and aplastic anemia. Because of this risk, patients who are started on <b>ticlopidine</b> are typically monitored with blood tests to test their cell counts every two weeks for the first three months.|$|E

5000|$|History of {{allergic}} reaction to <b>ticlopidine</b> or any thienopyridine drug such as clopidogrel ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Ticlopidine</b> is a thienopyridine which, when metabolized by the body, irreversibly {{blocks the}} ADP {{receptor}} {{on the surface}} of platelets. Without ADP, fibrinogen does not bind to the platelet surface, preventing platelets from sticking to each other. By interfering with platelet function, <b>ticlopidine</b> prevents clots from forming on the inside of blood vessels. Anti-platelet effects start within 2 days and reach their maximum by 6 days of therapy. Ticlopidine’s effects persist for 3 days after discontinuing <b>ticlopidine</b> although it may take 1-2 weeks for platelet function to return to normal, as the medication affects platelets irreversibly. Therefore, new platelets must be formed before platelet function normalizes.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{increased}} risk of bleeding, patients taking <b>ticlopidine</b> should discontinue the medication 10-14 days before surgery.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ticlopidine</b> is {{ingested}} orally with 80% bioavailability with rapid absorption. Even higher absorption {{can occur}} if <b>ticlopidine</b> is taken with food. It is metabolized by the liver with both renal and fecal elimination. Clearance is nonlinear and varies with repeated dosing. After the first dose the half life is 12.6 hours, but with repeated dosing the maximum half life is 4-5 days. Clearance is also slower in the elderly. The drug is 98% reversibly bound to proteins.|$|E
50|$|Inhibitors of purinergic receptors include clopidogrel, prasugrel and <b>ticlopidine,</b> {{as well as}} ticagrelor. All {{of these}} are {{antiplatelet}} agents that block P2Y12 receptors.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to {{his interest in the}} mechanisms of stroke and best practices for treatment, Hachinski also has a keen research interest in stroke prevention. He acted as the principal neurological investigator on several seminal, multicentre studies, beginning with the Canadian-American <b>Ticlopidine</b> study (1983-88) and the Extracranial/Intracranial Arterial Bypass Surgery trial (1983-87). The former showed a preventative advantage to the drug <b>Ticlopidine</b> over commonly-prescribed Aspirin, while the latter showed that the increasingly popular and very expensive EC/IC arterial bypass procedure did not significantly reduce the risk of ischemic stroke.|$|E

50|$|Many anti-platelet {{drugs such}} as Prasugrel, Ticagrelor, and <b>Ticlopidine</b> are {{adenosine}} diphosphate (ADP) receptor inhibitors. Before the expiry of its patent, the P2Y12 receptor antagonist Clopidogrel (trade name: Plavix) was the second most prescribed drug in the world.

50|$|<b>Ticlopidine</b> is FDA {{approved}} {{for the prevention}} of strokes and, when combined with aspirin, for patients with a new coronary stent to prevent closure. There are also several off-label uses, including acute treatment of myocardial infarction and unstable angina, peripheral vascular disease, prevention of myocardial infarctions, diabetic retinopathy, and sickle cell disease.|$|E
50|$|Antiplatelet {{medications}} such as aspirin {{are generally}} recommended. They reduce the overall risk of recurrence by 13% with greater benefit early on. The initial treatment is aspirin, second-line is clopidogrel (Plavix), third-line is <b>ticlopidine.</b> If TIAs recur after aspirin treatment, {{the combination of}} aspirin and dipyridamole may be recommended. Some people may also be given modified-release dipyridamole or clopidogrel.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{of these is}} aspirin, and its similar drug class, the NSAIDs. Other {{antiplatelet}} drugs are commonly prescribed for patients with acute coronary syndromes such as clopidogrel and <b>ticlopidine.</b> When surgery is undertaken following the administration of these drugs, bleeding can be serious. Transfusion under these circumstances is not clear-cut and one has to use clinical judgment in these cases.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ticlopidine</b> is {{considered}} a second-line option {{for the prevention of}} thrombotic strokes among patients who have previously had a stroke or TIA. Studies have shown that it is superior to aspirin in the prevention of death or future strokes. However, it also has more frequent and serious side effects compared to aspirin, so it is reserved for those patients that cannot take aspirin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ticlopidine</b> was {{discovered}} incidentally in the 1970s {{while trying to}} develop a new anti-inflammatory medication. Pharmacology developers noted that this new compound had strong anti-platelet properties. In 1978 it began to be marketed in France for patients at high risk for thrombotic events: postoperative cardiac patients, patients undergoing hemodialysis, peripheral vascular disease, and the prevention of strokes and ischemic heart disease.|$|E
