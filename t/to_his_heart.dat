5|$|Melvyn Douglas as Homer Bannon: Hud's father, Lonnie's {{grandfather}} {{and owner of}} the Bannon ranch. Although Paramount was doubtful about casting him due <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> condition, Martin Ritt insisted that he was the right actor for the role.|$|E
5|$|In the game's secret ending, {{which takes}} place after the events of Kingdom Hearts II, Aqua meets Ansem the Wise {{in the realm of}} {{darkness}} and learns from him about Sora, who has the power to save those connected <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart.</b> Sora, having learned of their fates from King Mickey's letter, undertakes another quest to save them.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the events}} {{happening}} in Cuba at the time, Betances thought that his diplomatic work {{was more important}} than ever. However, his failing health (he had uremia, and since his lungs could not exchange oxygen properly this put extra burden <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> and kidneys) prevented Betances from performing further diplomatic work from France on behalf of Puerto Rico or Cuba. His illness, which lasted more than a year, prevented him from performing medical work, and forced the Party to approve a stipend for Betances during his long illness, until his death.|$|E

5|$|Marcus tears out the {{hardware}} linking him to Skynet and assists John in battling the new T-800 (Model 101) Terminator (Kickinger). Marcus is soon outclassed in strength and temporarily disabled until John {{comes to his}} aid. Marcus eventually defeats the T-800, while John destroys the Skynet base by rigging together explosives. John, Marcus, Kyle, and Star are airlifted out. John though was seriously wounded during the assault with a life-threatening injury <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart.</b> Marcus offers his own heart for transplantation, sacrificing himself to save John. As he recovers, John radios to other Resistance fighters that, although this battle has been won, the war is still not over.|$|E
5|$|The pieces {{relating}} to Ireland {{are those of}} a public nature; in which the Dean appears, as usual, in the best light, because they do honour <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> {{as well as to}} his head; furnishing some additional proofs, that, though he was very free in his abuse of the inhabitants of that country, as well natives as foreigners, he had their interest sincerely at heart, and perfectly understood it. His sermon upon Doing Good, though peculiarly adapted to Ireland and Wood's designs upon it, contains perhaps the best motives to patriotism that were ever delivered within so small a compass.|$|E
5|$|Gilligan played cricket for Dulwich College {{before the}} First World War, then for Cambridge, twice winning his blue. He briefly played county cricket for Surrey but moved to Sussex in 1920. Following {{a slow start}} to his county career, he rapidly {{improved}} and in partnership with Maurice Tate established a formidable bowling reputation. First playing for England in 1922, he was appointed Test captain in 1924. In the latter year, Gilligan was {{at the height of}} his form when he suffered a blow <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> while batting. The strain affected his bowling, which was never again as effective, but he still captained England in Australia during the 1924â€“25 season. The series was lost, but both he and his team were popular and respected. In following years, he played less frequently; he resigned as Sussex captain in 1929 and retired three years later. He subsequently became a writer, journalist and cricket commentator while maintaining his connections with Sussex.|$|E

60|$|In a forest, as Nazinred suggested, {{the high}} crest {{might have been}} inconvenient, but out on the floes the {{unencumbered}} immensity of the Arctic sky afforded the boy room <b>to</b> swagger <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart's</b> content.|$|R
5|$|Sora's body {{is brought}} back to Yen Sid's tower, where Riku enters Sora's dreams and {{releases}} his heart from Ventus' armor, which has been possessed by a Nightmare. Riku then arrives at a digital version of the Destiny Islands, where he meets a virtual copy of Ansem the Wise. Ansem assures that Sora is now awake, and gives Riku his research data he had left in Sora's heart to help Sora save those connected <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart.</b> Upon returning {{to the realm of}} light, Riku is declared a Keyblade Master by Yen Sid for braving the realm of sleep a second time to reawaken Sora; Lea also reveals himself to have become a Keyblade wielder, and intends to become a Master as well. Sora is undaunted by his failure and returns to the sleeping worlds, where he thanks his Spirit Dream Eater companions.|$|E

25|$|FitzMaurice {{attacked}} Perrot, but retired on mistaking a small cavalry {{company for}} the advance party of a larger force. After a second and successful siege by Perrot of the Geraldine stronghold of Castlemaine, FitzMaurice sued for pardon, which was granted in February 1573, after he prostrated himself in Kilmallock church with the president's sword point next <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart.</b> FitzMaurice swore fealty to the crown, and gave up his son as hostage.|$|E
25|$|When {{writing a}} book review for Tatler, Fry wrote under a pen name, Williver Hendry, editor of A Most Peculiar Friendship: The Correspondence of Lord Alfred Douglas and Jack Dempsey, a field close <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> as an Oscar Wilde enthusiast. Once a {{columnist}} in The Listener and The Daily Telegraph, he now writes a weekly technology column in the Saturday edition of The Guardian. His blog attracted more than 300,000 visitors in its first two weeks.|$|E
25|$|The {{horse is}} led back to Ayodhya, and the ritualistic {{second stage of}} the yaga starts. Just then Rama {{receives}} the news that Shambuka has resumed his penance, and Lakshmana is despatched to slay the erring shudra. As the ceremony nears completion, Valmiki arrives with Lava and Kusha, but Vasishta debars Valmiki from entering the yagashala. Rama recognises Lava and Kusha as his sons, and takes them <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart.</b> The joy of Sita, then, is represented in the glorious splendour of nature.|$|E
60|$|Here, {{leaning on}} the rope, and scientifically biting a straw while he talked, Ben played showman <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart's</b> content till the neigh of a horse from the circus tent beyond {{reminded}} him of the joys to come.|$|R
60|$|Ralph never laughed, {{but on this}} {{occasion}} he produced the nearest approach to it that he could, and waiting until Mr Squeers had enjoyed the professional joke <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart's</b> content, inquired what had brought him to town.|$|R

25|$|Aoi Kenzaki was a {{world-class}} pianist {{from a family}} of pianists. However, he changed to violin and was chosen to be taught by Hane. Due <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> condition, he cannot play the violin for extended periods of time and has to take his medication periodically. He ignores warnings about his health from his doctor as well as his family to strive to become acknowledged as a violinist. After losing a contest to play all three movements of Beethoven's Kreutzer against Reiji, he renounces the violin and returns to his manor in Kyoto, where he takes up gardening.|$|E
25|$|Despite his well-groomed {{and dressed}} exterior, {{the man was}} in very poor health. The post mortem showed that he had {{advanced}} stages of prostate cancer and bone tumours. His heart showed signs of previous heart attacks and he possessed only one kidney, the other being removed. For {{a man who had}} serious health conditions, the toxicology report stated that he had no medication of any sort in his system. The medical examiner stated that, due <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> attacks and health status, the man would have been in significant pain and required prescription pain medicine or at least over-the-counter pain relievers to manage his pain.|$|E
25|$|After {{destroying}} the entire Pandava camp, Ashwatthama proceeds towards Duryodana with the cut-off {{heads of the}} Upapandavas. He told Duryodhana that he only managed to kill the Pandava's children as the Pandavas were not there, and this makes Duryodhana happy, as that means the Pandava lineage would die out. Duryodhana then, having heard the news that was so agreeable <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart,</b> regained his senses and praised Ashwatthama for achieving what Bhishma, Drona, and Karna had failed to accomplish. Duryodhana died happily with a smile in his face. At the same time, Sanjaya loses his divine sight, {{which he had been}} using to update Duryodhana's father Dhritarashtra.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he wanted}} still more liberty, and letting down the bars that led {{into a big}} field he began riding over the meadow and {{throwing}} his lasso at imaginary cattle, while he yelled and whooped <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart's</b> content.|$|R

60|$|And {{then there}} was an audible hiss, but whether {{it came from the}} {{apparent}} lunatic's own lips, or was the real hiss of a serpent, might admit of a discussion. At all events, it made Herkimer shudder <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart's</b> core.|$|R
25|$|For instance, {{for people}} with known {{atherosclerosis}} diseases, the 2004 updated American Heart Association, NIH and NCEP recommendations are for LDL levels to be lowered to less than 70nbsp&mg/dL, unspecified how much lower. This low level of less than 70nbsp&mg/dL (higher than Tim Russert's value shortly prior <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> attack) was recommended for primary prevention of 'very-high risk patients' and in secondary prevention as a 'reasonable further reduction'. Lack of evidence for such a recommendation is discussed {{in an article in}} the Annals of internal medicine. It should also be noted that statin drugs involved in such clinical trials have numerous physiological effects beyond simply the reduction of LDL levels.|$|E
25|$|Hisao is a male {{high school}} student {{diagnosed}} with chronic cardiac arrhythmia and congenital heart muscle deficiency. In the prologue, he collapses from a major heart attack. Due <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart</b> condition, he transfers to Yamaku High School in class 3-3, and although initially resentful of his placement in a school for the disabled, he eventually adapts to his new lifestyle. Through his new relationships and interactions, he begins to reconsider his preconceptions towards disabilities, including his own. His main hobbies include reading and chess. Some time after Hisao's name was decided on, the developers learned of a published Japanese psychologist with the same name, and acknowledged in the Dev Blog that the connection was complete coincidence.|$|E
25|$|His {{enthusiastic}} and aggressive approach {{on the field}} also gets him into trouble and he was notably brought before the match referee for making offensive facial gestures to Chris Gayle and subsequently fined half of his match fee. He is also known to be verbally aggressive towards batsmen. This behaviour came back to bite him during India's First Test on their 2006 tour of South Africa, when he verbally admonished Sreesanth, an Indian bowler, after Sreesanth had trouble evading a delivery targeted at his upper-body. Nel gestured <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>heart,</b> indicating that he felt Sreesanth lacked courage. Nel's next delivery was hit for a six over long off by Sreesanth who broke into a wild dance after the shot, clearly mocking Nel.|$|E
