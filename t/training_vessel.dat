5|$|At {{the time}} of its {{formation}} in 1921, the KJRM obtained four former Austro-Hungarian s that had been converted into minesweepers. Three were discarded soon after, but one served as a <b>training</b> <b>vessel</b> until the April 1941 invasion, at which time she was captured by the Italians. The Germans captured her in September 1943 and she was lost in their hands some time later.|$|E
5|$|SM U-4 {{was laid}} down in March 1907 at Germaniawerft in Kiel (work no. 136) and {{launched}} in November 1908. Upon completion, she was towed via Gibraltar to Pola, where she arrived in January 1909. She was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in August, {{and served as a}} <b>training</b> <b>vessel</b> through the beginning of World War I.|$|E

5|$|Nebojša was {{the second}} and last of the class. After repairs {{following}} an accident in 1930, she participated in several cruises in the Mediterranean during the interwar period. She evaded capture during the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, and {{was used by the}} Royal Navy as an anti-submarine warfare <b>training</b> <b>vessel.</b> After the war she was overhauled by the Yugoslavs and renamed Tara, continuing in a training role until she was stricken in 1954.|$|E
5|$|Prinz Adalbert {{went into}} {{service as a}} gunnery <b>training</b> <b>vessel</b> for the fleet after her commissioning, while Friedrich Carl served with the cruiser {{division}} of the battle fleet. In 1909, Friedrich Carl joined her sister ship as a <b>training</b> <b>vessel,</b> {{being used as a}} torpedo training ship. The two ships were re-mobilized after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914. Both ships were assigned to Admiral Behring's cruiser squadron in the Baltic Sea, with Friedrich Carl serving as his flagship. The squadron was based in Neufahrwasser in Danzig. Behring was ordered to undertake actions against the Russian port of Libau, which was believed to be acting as a staging area for British submarines. On the first assault on the port, on 17 November 1914, Friedrich Carl struck a pair of Russian naval mines off Memel. The ship's crew managed to keep the cruiser afloat long enough to allow nearby vessels to take off the entire crew; only seven men were killed in the attack. The operation proceeded as planned, however, and several blockships were sunk in the harbor entrance.|$|E
5|$|Schleswig-Holstein {{fired the}} first shots of World War II when she bombarded the Polish base at Danzig's Westerplatte {{in the early}} morning hours of 1 September 1939. The ship was used as a <b>training</b> <b>vessel</b> for the {{majority}} of the war, and was sunk by British bombers in Gotenhafen in December 1944. Schleswig-Holstein was subsequently salvaged and then beached for use by the Soviet Navy as a target. As of 1990, the ship's bell was on display in the Bundeswehr Military History Museum in Dresden.|$|E

5|$|Sydney was {{the first}} of three {{conventional}} aircraft carriers to serve in the RAN, and operated as the navy's flagship during the early part of her career. From late 1951 to early 1952, she operated off the coast of Korea during the Korean War, making her the first carrier owned by a Commonwealth Dominion, and the only carrier in the RAN, to see wartime service. Retasked as a <b>training</b> <b>vessel</b> following the 1955 arrival of her modernised sister ship, , Sydney remained in service until 1958, when she was placed in reserve as surplus to requirements.|$|E
5|$|After being {{launched}} in 1872, {{she served as}} a <b>training</b> <b>vessel</b> from 1875 in the South China Sea, making at least one journey to Japan. Yangwu was equipped with a classroom for the training of Chinese midshipmen and officers. At the time of {{a report in the}} Shanghai Courier in June 1876, there were 30 such sailors under tuition. She had been recently commanded by the Captain Tracey, an Englishman, but he had been recalled to the Royal Navy and promoted to Post-captain. He was replaced with his fellow countryman, Captain Luxmore. There were two further English members of the crew, both officers, while the rest were Chinese.|$|E
5|$|Engineers from AG Weser, UB-45s German builder, {{inspected}} the hulk {{and determined that}} repair of the wreck was feasible. A restoration of the submarine to operating condition, as either a <b>training</b> <b>vessel</b> or a military, would cost 21 million leva (about US$250,000 in 1936 dollars), significantly less than the 56 to 65 million leva ($680,000 to $790,000) that a comparable new submarine would cost. Ultimately, the Bulgarian Navy opted to order new submarines from Germany rather than repair UB-45. UB-45s deck gun was reused, however, {{and one of the}} U-boat's diesel engines was restored to operating condition and used on the training ship Assen.|$|E

5|$|From 1927 to 1942, Kasuga {{was used}} as a <b>training</b> <b>vessel</b> for navigators and engineers. On 27 July 1928 she rescued the crew of the {{semi-rigid}} airship N3 after it exploded in heavy weather during fleet maneuvers. In January–February 1934, Kasuga ferried 40 scientists to Truk to observe a total solar eclipse on 14 February. She was hulked and disarmed in July 1942 and used as a floating barracks {{for the rest of the}} Pacific War. Kasuga capsized at her mooring at Yokosuka on 18 July 1945 during an air raid by United States Navy aircraft from TF-38. Her wreck was salvaged in August 1948 and broken up for scrap by the Uraga Dock Company.|$|E
5|$|UB-11s {{commanding}} officer at commissioning only remained {{in charge of}} the ship for a week. Sources do not report any more {{commanding officer}}s assigned {{through the end of the}} war, so it's not clear if the submarine remained in commission. UB-11 was reported in use as a <b>training</b> <b>vessel</b> at Kiel in September 1915. The U-boat made no war patrols and sank no ships during the war, which may indicate that the vessel remained in a training role. At the end of the war, UB-11 was deemed unseaworthy and unable to surrender at Harwich with the rest of Germany's U-boat fleet. She remained in Germany where she was broken up by Stinnes in February 1920.|$|E
5|$|While {{in command}} of the Countess of Ranfurly, Worsley joined the Royal Navy Reserve (RNR) and on 1 January 1902 was {{appointed}} a sub-lieutenant. In 1904, Countess of Ranfurly was sold, and this left Worsley without a command. Rather than stay in the employ of the New Zealand Government Steamer Service, he decided to look abroad for work. He travelled to Sydney and found a berth as chief officer on HMS Sparrow, which was on its delivery voyage to New Zealand, having been recently purchased by the New Zealand Government. When the Sparrow arrived in Wellington in March 1905, he was selected to command the ship while it was converted to a <b>training</b> <b>vessel.</b> The conversion was still incomplete when he left for England in early 1906.|$|E

5|$|Both ships saw {{extensive}} {{service with}} the German Navy; Prinz Adalbert {{was used as}} a gunnery training ship for her entire peacetime career, while Friedrich Carl served with the fleet until 1909, when she was withdrawn to act as a torpedo <b>training</b> <b>vessel.</b> At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, both vessels were mobilized and assigned to the cruiser squadron in the Baltic. Friedrich Carl was sunk by Russian naval mines off Memel in November 1914, though most of her crew was safely evacuated. Prinz Adalbert was torpedoed twice by British submarines operating in the Baltic; the first, on 1 July 1915, caused serious damage that was ultimately repaired. The second, on 23 October 1915, caused a catastrophic explosion in the ship's ammunition magazines that destroyed the vessel. Six hundred and seventy-two men were killed, the greatest single loss of life for the German Navy in the Baltic during the war.|$|E
5|$|During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, she and two Orjen-class motor torpedo boats evaded capture by Italian forces at the Bay of Kotor, arriving at Suda Bay, Crete, on 23 April, after eight days at sea. Despite this, the Italians {{claimed that they}} had sunk all the Yugoslav vessels. Nebojša then sailed to Alexandria, but the Royal Navy considered her unfit for combat duties. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill suggested her crew might be retrained and used to operate the recently captured German Type VIIC U-boat U-570, but this idea was soon abandoned. She was based at Valletta in Malta as an anti-submarine warfare <b>training</b> <b>vessel,</b> serving with the British 2nd Submarine Flotilla in 1942 and the British 3rd Submarine Flotilla in 1943. She continued working in the Mediterranean {{until the end of}} the war, but her service with the Royal Navy appears to have been limited to a training role.|$|E
5|$|Fleet {{exercises}} in 1934 {{were carried out}} in the Bay of Biscay, followed by a fleet regatta in Navarino Bay off Greece. In 1935, the ship returned to Britain for the Jubilee Fleet Review for King George V. In August 1935, Royal Sovereign was transferred to the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet, where she served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Charles Ramsey. The ship served as a <b>training</b> <b>vessel</b> until 2 June 1937, when she was again placed in reserve for a major overhaul. This lasted until 18 February 1938, after which she returned to the 2nd Battle Squadron. In 1939, King George VI made a state visit to Canada; Royal Sovereign {{and the rest of the}} fleet escorted his ship halfway across the Atlantic and met it on the return leg of the voyage.|$|E
