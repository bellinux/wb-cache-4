5|$|The first {{botanical garden}} in the United States, Bartram's Garden, was founded in 1730 near Philadelphia, {{and in the same}} year, the Linnaean Botanic Garden at Philadelphia itself.

In 1859, the Missouri Botanical Garden was founded at St Louis; it is now one of the world’s leading gardens specializing in tropical plants. This was one of several popular American gardens, including Longwood Gardens (1798), Arnold Arboretum (1872), New York Botanical Garden (1891), Huntington Botanical Gardens (1906), Brooklyn Botanic Garden (1910), International Peace Garden (1932), and Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden (1938).|$|E

25|$|For the Barre regime, the {{invasion}} {{was perhaps the}} greatest strategic blunder since independence, and it weakened the military.

500|$|In 1850, the Frankfurt Parliament collapsed, and the German Confederation was {{restored}} under Austrian presidency, who suppressed {{the actions of}} the failed Frankfurt Parliament, including the tricolour. Afterwards, the most pressing issue was whether or not to include Austria in any future German nation, as Austria's status as a multi-ethnic empire complicated <b>the</b> <b>dream</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> united Greater Germany—the [...] solution. Alternatively, there was the [...] (Lesser German) solution for a Germany that encompassed only German lands and excluded Austria. The Prussian–Austrian duality within the Confederation eventually led to the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. During the war, the southern states allied with Austria adopted the black-red-gold tricolour as their flag, and the 8th German Army Corps also wore black-red-gold armbands. The Kingdom of Prussia and its predominately north German allies defeated Austria and made way for the realisation of the Lesser German solution a few years later.|$|E
500|$|According to Gerard Libaridian, [...] "by the 1970s, the {{recognition}} of the [...] genocide became a very important objective of the Armenian cause and diaspora political parties linked {{the recognition}} of the genocide and <b>the</b> <b>dream</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> greater Armenia because Turkey's recognition of the genocide would constitute the legal basis for the Armenian claims on Western Armenia." [...] From the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, several Armenian militant (often considered terrorist) groups operated in the Middle East and Western Europe. Most notably the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA) carried out armed attacks on Turkish diplomatic missions around the world. Two ARF-affiliated groups—the Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide (JCAG) and the Armenian Revolutionary Army (ARA)—also carried out similar attacks, mainly in Western Europe. David C. Rapoport argues that these organizations were inspired by Kourken Yanigian, a 77-year-old Armenian genocide survivor, who assassinated two Turkish consular officials in California in 1973 as an act of revenge against Turkey.|$|E

500|$|Following the setback in Vienna and Berlin Crisis of 1961, {{as well as}} the Soviet {{decision}} to resume testing in August (attributed by Moscow to a changed international situation and French nuclear tests), Kennedy faced mounting pressure from the Department of Defense and nuclear laboratories to set aside <b>the</b> <b>dream</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> test ban. In June 1961, following stalled talks in Geneva, Kennedy had argued that Soviet negotiating behavior raised [...] "a serious question about how long we can safely continue on a voluntary basis a refusal to undertake tests in this country without any assurance that the Russians are not testing." [...] Whether or not the Soviet Union had actually conducted secret tests was a matter of debate within the Kennedy administration. A team led by physicist Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky reported that while the Soviet Union could have secretly tested weapons, there was no evidence indicating that it actually had. Panofsky's findings were dismissed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as [...] "assertive, ambiguous, semiliterate and generally unimpressive." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's title {{refers to}} the biblical story of Jacob's Ladder, or <b>the</b> <b>dream</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> meeting place between Heaven and Earth (Genesis 28:12). Its little-known {{alternate}} title is Dante's Inferno, in a reference to Inferno by Dante Alighieri. Screenwriter and co-producer Bruce Joel Rubin perceived the film as a modern interpretation of the Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State, the Tibetan Book of the Dead. Rubin said: [...] "The inspiration in a sense is my entire spiritual upbringing. Once you have a meditative life you start {{to see that the}} world is really far different than what it appears to be. What appears to be finite is really couched in the infinite, and the infinite imbues everything in our lives." [...] Before writing his scripts for Jacob's Ladder and Ghost, which too was released in 1990, the Jewish-born Rubin spent two years in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in Nepal; previously, he has also written afterlife-themed Brainstorm and Deadly Friend. His original screenplay for Jacob's Ladder differs significantly at parts from the final film, especially towards the ending.|$|E
500|$|... "Dreams Old Men Dream" [...] was {{inspired}} by the Ingmar Bergman film Wild Strawberries and Fyodor Dostoyevskys short story <b>The</b> <b>Dream</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Ridiculous Man. It tells the story of an elderly man reflecting back on the life he had and what he wished he had done before. [...] "On the Night My Love Broke Through" [...] was the last song made for the album that was recorded live. It {{was inspired}} by the works of German-American poet Charles Bukowski. [...] "Relief" [...] is written {{from the perspective of a}} person that questions God's way of controlling the Earth and handling its inhabitants. God himself answers the person's question when Willett sings, [...] "Flash flood, you got too comfortable, so I showed you, who's really in control." [...] The overall sound of the track is described as electronica in the vein of [...] "mid-era Radiohead." [...] The album closer, [...] "Cryptomnesia", {{was inspired by}} a case involving Russian-American novelist Vladimir Nabokov being accused of plagiarism involving his 1955 novel Lolita.

500|$|As {{opposed to}} Taeyeon's {{signature}} balladic styles, [...] "Why" [...] {{was described as}} a hybrid of [...] "trendy" [...] EDM and R.

[...] The Flying House is rendered in meticulous realistic detail. [...] The house is conventional in every respect—until the viewer reaches the attic, where the woman's husband is seen tending an enormous engine.

[...] He says he plans to [...] "steal the house", and the couple fly away to find a place where their landlord will never find them—a swamp, the ocean, even the moon, where they are chased off by the Man in the Moon with a flyswatter. [...] The film self-consciously directs the viewers to notice the quality and accuracy of the animation when the house takes off into space, calling attention to the [...] "remarkable piece of animation which follows", accurately showing the revolutions of the Earth and Moon and the [...] "beautiful constellation of Orion". [...] The woman becomes anxious that they will become [...] "lost in the sky".
