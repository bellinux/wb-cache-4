An important conclusion {{of this study is that}} whilst the responsibility for preparing student teachers for moral education rests with individual <b>teacher</b> <b>educators,</b> this process is largely implicit and unplanned. This is due in part to the lack of a language for expressing the moral dimension in teaching.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade several {{professional}} standards describing competencies for teaching staff in secondary and higher education have been developed. Not all these standards are considered fruitful by the relevant professional communities of <b>teachers</b> and <b>teacher</b> <b>educators.</b> In this article we analyse the experiences with the Dutch standard for <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> and an accompanying procedure for self-assessment, professional development and registration (SPR). Our questions are: what are the issues about professional complexity and ownership which arise? How is the standard used by the Dutch <b>teacher</b> <b>educators?</b> Does the standard stimulate professional development {{or is it a}} quality assurance device for <b>teacher</b> <b>educators?</b> To answer these questions we analysed interviews, questionnaires and portfolios from <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> who participated in the procedure for SPR. We found that in the Dutch standard for <b>teacher</b> <b>educators,</b> complexity is brought into the SPR processes by, for example, <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> sharing the content in a professional dialogue with peer assessors or by asking <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> to write about authentic situations in which different competencies are integrated and related to one another. The development of the Dutch standard by the <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> themselves contributed to powerful feelings of ownership. We conclude that the Dutch standard, plus the accompanying procedure for SPR, is not only helpful for individual professional accountability, but is used and esteemed as well as a strong instrument for individual professional development. © 2008 Association for Teacher Education in Europe...|$|R

5000|$|Some {{research}} suggests that, while most countries have policies, and legislation, in place concerning the teaching profession, few countries {{have a clear}} policy or strategy on the <b>teacher</b> <b>educator</b> profession.

50|$|But the key duality of {{identity}} that {{lies at the}} core of the <b>teacher</b> <b>educator</b> profession is that of first-order and second order teaching. A <b>teacher</b> <b>educator</b> must be a highly competent ‘first-order educator’ (i.e. a good teacher) but also a skilled ‘second-order educator’ (i.e. capable of teaching effectively about the skill of teaching and facilitating others to acquire teaching skills). As first-order educators, they need to be proficient teachers (of 'adult' students). As second-order educators, they require, in addition, specific competences and dispositions, such as modelling and meta-reflection, that enable them to teach about teaching.|$|E
5000|$|Many writers {{advocate}} for <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> themselves {{to act as}} models of reflective practice. This implies that the way that <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> teach their students needs to be congruent with the approaches they expect their students to adopt with pupils; <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> should not only model the way to teach, but should also explain why they have chosen a particular approach whilst doing so, by reference to theory; this implies that <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> {{need to be aware}} of their own tacit theories of teaching and able to connect them overtly to public theory.

40|$|The NCATE {{requirements}} {{introduced in}} 2004 presented {{a new challenge}} for <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> in {{that they had to}} define, develop, and assess teacher dispositions in their programs in systematic ways (Dottin, 2009; Schussler, Bercaw, & Stooksberry, 2008).

(Notar, Riley, & Taylor, 2009; Shiveley & Misco, 2010; Thomas, 2010). In order to reach an agreeable and clear definition of teacher dispositions, {{it is important to understand}} <b>teacher</b> <b>educators?</b> perceptions about <b>teacher</b> dispositions (Freeman, 2007; Notar, Riley, & Taylor, 2009). The following research questions guided this study: 1) What are the perceptions of <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> about <b>teacher</b> dispositions in terms of the extent to which selected dispositions are innate or teachable? 2) What are perceptions of <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> about <b>teacher</b> dispositions in terms of the extent to which selected dispositions are important to being a teacher? 3) To what extent do <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> report that they are teaching dispositions in their classes? 4) What are the perceptions of <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> about the effectiveness of integration methods of teacher dispositions into the coursework and conceptual framework?

40|$|A {{plethora of}} reports, {{research}} papers and commentaries {{have focused on}} teacher education in Australia, its quality, status and ability to adequately prepare teachers for the 21 st century. There is however, little research on the worklives of <b>teacher</b> <b>educators,</b> in particular Australian <b>teacher</b> <b>educators.</b> That which does exist tends to focus on new <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> (how to best prepare and induct them) and experienced and senior <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> (personal reflections and narratives) (see for example, Acker, 1997; Cochran-Smith, 2002; Murray & Male, 2005). What is missing from this research field is {{an exploration of the}} contemporary contexts that shape the worklives of Australian <b>teacher</b> <b>educators,</b> and in particular how these contexts influence the work of <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> in between these two demographic groups. How post-induction early-mid career <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> (re) negotiate their professional identities in view of the changing role of ‘the teacher educator’ in the 21 st century is therefore, an under-researched area of study. This paper provides a brief overview of the existent research on <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> and highlights areas in need of further examination. Two particular contexts shaping the work of Australian <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> are examined: the standards movement, and marketisation and the rise of new mangerialism as are the ramifications of these on the teacher education landscape. How these have impacted on how <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> perceive themselves and are perceived by others is subsequently explored as are the implications of these changing contexts on the work of <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> in the 21 st century. To discuss these issues I draw on my experiences in teacher education and highlight the challenges and opportunities available for <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> as we try to ‘survive the maelstrom’. This paper is significant given the federal government’s commitment to social inclusion and an ‘Education Revolution” (ACDE, 2008). Education academics are critical to advancing the [Government’s] complex agendas around innovation, productivity and inclusion (ACDE, 2008, p 1). In the next 15 years, over half of the currently working teacher education academics will retire. There is therefore a need to not only attract new and talented people into the teacher education workforce, but to retain those early-mid career academics who have entered teacher education, and are like me, finding it hard to “survive the maelstrom”. <br /...|$|R
40|$|As all professionals, <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> are {{expected}} to develop themselves continuously during their working life {{in order to keep}} their knowledge and skills up to date. Smith (2003, p 203) distinguishes three reasons for <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> to develop themselves: 1) to improve the profession (teacher education); 2) to maintain interest in the profession, to grow personally and professionally and 3) to advance within the profession, promotion. At the teacher education institute of the Fontys University of Applied Science, <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> are stimulated by the management to spend 10 - 15 % of their working hours on professional development. Do <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> spend these hours and if they dos so, what purpose do they have in mind? What activities do they undertake to develop themselves? What topics do they choose for professional development? Are there differences between more experienced <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> and beginning <b>teacher</b> <b>educators?</b> To study these questions, a questionnaire was held by all 228 <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> working at the Fontys teacher education institute. At this institute, about 4000 student-teachers are educated to become a teacher in secondary or vocational education. First impressions of the results show that 33 % of the <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> spend 10 - 15 % of their time on professional development. A large group of <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> (42 %) spends less then 10 % and a small group (23 %) spends more then 15 % of their time on professional development. The main reason for <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> to professionalize themselves is {{to improve the quality of}} their teaching to students. This refers to the second reason Smith (2003) mentions. Improving the profession or advance within the profession (reason 1 and 3 in Smith's list) were much less often mentioned. The four activities most mentioned by <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> to develop themselves were reading of (scientific) literature (1), followed by collegial consultation (2), attending conferences or meetings (3) and trying out new approaches and systematically evaluating them (4). The topics <b>teacher</b> <b>educators</b> develop themselves in vary from didactical subjects to coaching skills, subject-specific topics and ICT-skills. Further analysis to reveal whether there are differences between experienced and beginning teachers is still in progress, but will be available at the conference in August 2011.
