5|$|The cockpit in the Sea Harrier {{includes}} a conventional centre stick arrangement and left-hand throttle. In addition to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectorable nozzles. The nozzles point rearward with the lever in the forward position for horizontal flight. With the lever back, the nozzles point downward for vertical takeoff or landing. <b>The</b> <b>usefulness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertical landing capability of the Sea Harrier was demonstrated in an incident on 6 June 1983, when Sub Lieutenant Ian Watson lost contact with the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious and had to land Sea Harrier ZA176 on the foredeck of the Spanish cargo ship Alraigo.|$|E
5|$|The fortifications {{surrounded}} the entire harbour area, stretching {{all the way}} from Sliema to Kalkara. The design of the batteries was based on the coastal batteries and entrenchments built by the Order in the 18th century, while most of the entrenchments consisted of long stretches of rubble walls. They were armed by guns taken from coastal fortifications such as Saint Mary's Tower. <b>The</b> <b>usefulness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fortifications was tested in 1799 when a French counter-attack from Fort Manoel was repelled by the insurgent batteries.|$|E

In particular, the {{research has focused on}} a few key areas: rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter, effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance, directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step, and improving the overall stereoselectivity. These have been successful to varying degrees.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> primacy-recency reinforcement (wrap), i. e. {{when the}} first and last review of a set have the same valence, on the behavioral intentions (purchase and recommendation intention) of review readers. In addition, we study how this effect is mediated by <b>the</b> perceived <b>usefulness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reviews. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> a 2 (Valence of first review: positive, negative) x 6 (Review sequence) full factorial between-subjects experiment (n = 552) confirm that wrap effects bias intentions. A positively wrapped review set leads to a higher purchase and recommendation intention than a non-wrapped review set with a positive first review. Conversely, a negatively wrapped review set leads to lower intentions than a non-wrapped review set with a negative first review. In case of a negative wrap, this relationship is mediated by <b>the</b> perceived <b>usefulness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reviews such that a negative wrap increases <b>the</b> perceived <b>usefulness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> review set which, in turn, affects intentions. In case of a positive wrap, the positive relationship between wrap and intentions is direct and not mediated by perceived usefulness. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>usefulness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Wall as a defence {{line against}} {{northern}} nomads became questionable under the Qing dynasty, since their territory encompassed vast areas {{inside and outside}} the wall: China proper, Manchuria, and Mongolia were all under Qing control. So instead, the Great Wall became the means to limit Han Chinese movement into the steppes. In the case of Manchuria, considered to be the sacred homeland by the ruling Manchu elites, some parts of the Ming Liaodong Wall were repaired so it could serve to control Han Chinese movement into Manchuria alongside the newly erected Willow Palisade.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the mirror flaw on {{scientific}} observations depended on the particular observationâ€”the core of the aberrated PSF was sharp enough to permit high-resolution observations of bright objects, and spectroscopy of point sources was only affected through a sensitivity loss. However, the loss of light to the large, out of focus halo severely reduced <b>the</b> <b>usefulness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> telescope for faint objects or high-contrast imaging. This meant that {{nearly all of the}} cosmological programs were essentially impossible, since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects. NASA and the telescope became the butt of many jokes, and the project was popularly regarded as a white elephant. For instance, in the 1991 comedy , Hubble was pictured with the Lusitania, the Hindenburg, and the Edsel. Nonetheless, during {{the first three years of}} the Hubble mission, before the optical corrections, the telescope still carried out a large number of productive observations of less demanding targets. The error was well characterized and stable, enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution.|$|E
5|$|The heavy {{casualties}} on Hill 205 rendered the company ineffective, {{and for several}} weeks it was only capable of being used to conduct routine patrols or as a security force for divisional headquarters elements. Puckett was evacuated to recover from his wounds. On 5 December, Captain John P. Vann assumed command of the company, and Captain Bob Sigholtz, a veteran of Merrill's Marauders, was also assigned to the unit. Yet with the company's casualties being replaced by regular soldiers who had no Ranger training it {{did not return to}} full combat capability after the Hill 205 battle. The replacements were subsequently given cursory training between missions, but U.S. military historians contend that the inexperienced replacements dramatically decreased <b>the</b> <b>usefulness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company as a special forces unit. The company participated in a few isolated missions in late 1950 and early 1951, including the recapture of Ganghwa Island from Chinese forces while attached to the Turkish Brigade. It advanced with the 25th Division during Operation Killer in late February {{as part of an effort}} to push Chinese forces north of the Han River. During that operation the company was employed as a scouting force, probing the strength of Chinese formations as they launched raids and attacks on the 25th Infantry Division. The frequent scouting missions were also intended to draw Chinese fire and determine the locations of their units.|$|E
