5|$|Bede wrote Ecgbert {{a letter}} dealing with monastic {{issues as well}} as the {{problems}} of large dioceses. The letter, written in 734, became known as the Epistola ad Ecgberhtum episcopum. Bede urged Ecgbert to study Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, and held up Aidan and Cuthbert as examples of model bishops. The main thrust of Bede's letter was to urge Ecgbert to reform his church to more closely resemble Gregory the Great's original plan for it. Bede's admonition to divide up dioceses fell on deaf ears, as Egbert did not break up his large diocese. The suffragans continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> to the bishops of Hexham, Lindisfarne, and Whithorn.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the debut}} of women's ski jumping at these championships, the big winner in the jumping events was Austria with three medals and two each for Wolfgang Loitzl and Gregor Schlierenzauer. Adding the 10km mass start, the Nordic {{combined}} format was changed from 7.5km sprint and 15km individual Gundersen to 10km individual large hill (aka Large hill Gundersen) and 10km individual normal hill (aka Normal hill Gundersen), respectively. Estonia's Andrus Veerpalu became the oldest gold medalist at 38 when he won gold in the men's 15km event. Despite concern over the lack of snowfall that plagued event preparation prior to the championships, the championships themselves had an abundance of snowfall and wind that caused the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined mass start to be postponed {{for a day and}} the ski jumping individual large hill competition <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> to one jump.|$|E

5|$|Like its sibling V-Bombers, the Victor {{made use}} of the Navigational and Bombing System (NBS); a little-used optical sight had also been {{installed}} upon early aircraft. For navigation and bomb-aiming purposes, the Victor employed numerous radar systems. These included the H2S radar, the first airborne ground-scanning radar, and the Green Satin radar. Radar information was inputted into the onboard electromechanical analogue bomb-aiming apparatus. Some of the navigation and targeting equipment was either directly descended from, or shared concepts with, those used on Handley Page's preceding Halifax bomber. Operationally, {{the accuracy of the}} bomb-aiming system proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> to roughly 400 yards, which was deemed sufficient for high-level nuclear strike operations.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 2013 season, Baseball America ranked Fernández as the Marlins' best {{prospect}} and {{the fifth}} best prospect in all of baseball. The Marlins invited Fernández to spring training but sent him to minor league camp before the season began. However, they chose to add Fernández to their 25-man Opening Day roster, {{due in part to}} injuries to Nathan Eovaldi and Henderson Álvarez. Also, Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria hoped that promoting Fernández would buy him goodwill with the fans, following a fire sale the previous offseason. He was planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> to approximately 150 to 170 innings during the 2013 season in order to protect his development.

Kennedy subsequently sought Shoup's advice in evaluating the implications of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. While his position in the Joint Chiefs of Staff was intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited,</b> he had gained Kennedy's confidence and was often called on for private consultations. Shoup supported the test ban, seeing it as a deterrent to nuclear war.|$|E

M. bovis was once a common cause of tuberculosis, but the introduction of pasteurized milk has almost completely eliminated this as a public health problem in developed countries. M. canetti is rare and seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> to the Horn of Africa, although a few cases have been seen in African emigrants. M. microti is also rare and is seen almost only in immunodeficient people, although its prevalence may be significantly underestimated.|$|E

Sometimes McCartney and Lennon would record simultaneously in different studios, each using different engineers. Late in the sessions, Martin, whose influence over the band had waned, spontaneously left to go on holiday, leaving Chris Thomas in charge of production. Lennon's devotion to Ono over the other Beatles, and the pair's addiction to heroin, made working conditions difficult as he became prone to bouts of temper.|$|E

5|$|As Kujira {{began to}} track towards Taiwan, the Taiwanese {{government}} issued land- and sea-based warnings {{in advance of}} the storm. The local weather bureau specifically alerted vessels off the southern and southeastern coasts of the island. Continued strengthening of Kujira prompted the Central Weather Bureau to issue medium typhoon warnings for several portions of Taiwan, though these warnings were downgraded to light typhoon status following the subsequent weakening of the typhoon on April22. This made Kujira the first April typhoon to prompt the issuance of any cyclone-related warnings in Taiwan since 1978. Impacts on the island were expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> to rainfall, though the forecasted precipitation was also expected to lessen ongoing drought conditions. However, mudslides were also a potential impact from the typhoon. The National Fire Administration and Taiwan Power Company developed a contingency plan for the typhoon and had also undertaken other precautionary measures. Airports on Orchid Island and Green Island were closed. The resultant rainfall from Kujira's outer rainbands would be some of the most significant for the island in several months.|$|E
5|$|Endemic to South Africa, the bluebuck was {{confined}} to the southwestern Cape. A 2003 study estimated the expanse of the historic range of the bluebuck at , mainly along the southern coast of South Africa; fossils, however, have been discovered in a broader area that includes the southern and western CFR and even the highlands of Lesotho. Historical records give a rough estimate of its range. On 20January 1774, Swedish naturalist Carl Peter Thunberg recorded a sighting in Tigerhoek, Mpumalanga. In March or April 1783, Levalliant claimed to have witnessed two specimens in Soetemelksvlei, Western Cape. Based on these notes, a 2009 study by the South African zoologist Graham I. H. Kerley and colleagues estimated {{the range of the}} bluebuck <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> within a triangular area in the Western Cape, bounded by Caledon to the west, Swellendam to the northeast and Bredasdorp to the south. Rock paintings in the Caledon river valley of the Free State province in eastern South Africa have been identified as bluebucks, which also confirms the once wider distribution of the species.|$|E
5|$|In 550, he {{was sent}} as envoy by Justinian to {{negotiate}} a peace treaty with Persia, a role he reprised in 561, when he met the Persian envoy Izedh Gushnap at Dara, to end the Lazic War. Reaching an agreement over the Persian evacuation of Lazica and the delineation of the border in Armenia, the two envoys concluded a fifty-year peace between the two empires and their respective allies. The annual Roman subsidies to Persia would resume, but the amount was lowered from 500 to 420 pounds of gold. Further clauses regulated cross-border trade, which was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>limited</b> to the two cities of Dara and Nisibis, the return of fugitives, {{and the protection of}} the respective religious minorities (Christians in the Persian Empire and Zoroastrians in Byzantium). In exchange for Persian recognition for the existence of Dara, whose construction had originally sparked a brief war, the Byzantines agreed to limit their troops there and remove the seat of the magister militum per Orientem from the city. As disagreements remained on two border areas, Suania and Ambros, in spring 562, Peter travelled to Persia to negotiate directly with the Persian Shah, Chosroes I, without however achieving a result. He then returned to Constantinople, where he died sometime after March 565.|$|E
