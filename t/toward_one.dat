5|$|Planet Nine modifies {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects via a {{combination}} of secular and resonant dynamics. The secular dynamics acts on very long timescales and causes {{the distance of the}} perihelia of anti-aligned objects to rise and fall while the directions of their perihelia oscillate. The resonant dynamics acts on shorter timescales and provides phase protection, maintaining the stability of the objects by preventing close approaches. The inclination of Planet Nine's orbit weakens this protection, resulting in a chaotic variation of semi-major axes as objects hop between resonances. The orbital poles of the objects circle that of the Solar System's Laplace plane, which is bent toward the plane of Planet Nine's orbit, causing their poles to be clustered <b>toward</b> <b>one</b> side.|$|E

5|$|William Herschel was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to attempt to determine the distribution of stars in the sky. During the 1780s he established a series of gauges in 600 directions and counted the stars observed along each line of sight. From this he deduced {{that the number of}} stars steadily increased <b>toward</b> <b>one</b> side of the sky, {{in the direction of the}} Milky Way core. His son John Herschel repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and found a corresponding increase in the same direction. In addition to his other accomplishments, William Herschel is also noted for his discovery that some stars do not merely lie along the same line of sight, but are also physical companions that form binary star systems.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that positive and negative stereotypes and attitudes toward age and aging may have substantial effects on the longterm development of cognitive and physical performance in old age. Relatively little is known to which degree attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>one's</b> own aging depend on (a) the current level of individual resources, (b) changes in the level of individual resources, or (c) the increasing age of older persons. The present study examined the relations between individual physical, mental, and cognitive resources and the attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>one's</b> own aging. The study was conducted with N= 500 participants of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Adult Development (ILSE) born between 1930 and 1932 (age: M= 63. 0, SD= 0. 9 at T 1 and M= 66. 9, SD= 0. 9 at T 2). The results indicate that the attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>one's</b> own aging (a) become more negative with increasing age, (b) most strongly depend on the available resources, (c) changes in level of resources contribute to the prediction of the attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>one's</b> own aging, and (d) age acts more as a reinforcing factor on the relation between resources and attitudes than as an independent factor on the attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>one's</b> own aging...|$|R

5|$|Cheetahs breed {{throughout}} the year; they are induced ovulators. Females become sexually mature at 21 to 22 months of age. Females are polyoestrusthey have an oestrus ("heat") cycle every 12days (this {{can vary from}} 10to 20 days), each oestrus lasting one to three days. A female can give birth again after 17 to 20 months; however, on {{the loss of a}} whole litter mothers can mate again. Urine-marking in males becomes more pronounced when a female in their vicinity comes into oestrus. Males fight among one another to secure access to the female; even males in a coalition may show some aggression <b>toward</b> <b>one</b> another on approaching a female. One male eventually wins dominance over the others. Mating, observed mainly at night, begins with the male approaching the female, who lies down on the ground. No courtship behaviour is observed; the male immediately secures hold of the female's nape and copulation takes place. The pair then ignore each other and part ways. However, they meet and copulate a few more times within the next few days. Polyandrous, females can mate with several males. The mean number of motile sperm in a single ejaculation is nearly 25.3million.|$|E
5|$|Where spotted hyenas and lions {{occupy the}} same {{geographic}} area, {{the two species}} occupy the same ecological niche, and are thus in direct competition with one another. In some cases, the extent of dietary overlap can {{be as high as}} 68.8%. Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them. There exists a common misconception that hyenas steal kills from lions, but most often it is the other way around. Lions will readily steal the kills of spotted hyenas; in the Ngorongoro Crater, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas. Lions are quick to follow the calls of hyenas feeding, a fact demonstrated by field experiments, during which lions repeatedly approached whenever the tape-recorded calls of hyenas feeding were played. When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas will either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30–100 metres until the lions have finished eating. In some cases, spotted hyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions, and may occasionally force lions off a kill. This mostly occurs during the nighttime, when hyenas are bolder. Spotted hyenas usually prevail against groups of lionesses unaccompanied by males if they outnumber them 4:1. In some instances they were seen to have taken on and routed two pride males while outnumbering them 5:1. The two species may act aggressively <b>toward</b> <b>one</b> another even when there is no food at stake. Lions may charge at hyenas and maul them for no apparent reason; one male lion was filmed killing two hyenas on separate occasions without eating them, and lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha. Spotted hyenas have adapted to this pressure by frequently mobbing lions which enter their territories. Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to the scent.|$|E

25|$|The gut is an endoderm-derived structure. At {{approximately}} the sixteenth day of human development, the embryo begins to fold ventrally (with the embryo's ventral surface becoming concave) in two directions: {{the sides of}} the embryo fold in on each other and the head and tail fold <b>toward</b> <b>one</b> another. The result is that a piece of the yolk sac, an endoderm-lined structure in contact with the ventral aspect of the embryo, begins to be pinched off to become the primitive gut. The yolk sac remains connected to the gut tube via the vitelline duct. Usually this structure regresses during development; in cases where it does not, it is known as Meckel's diverticulum.|$|E
25|$|Advances in {{experimental}} and theoretical {{studies have shown}} that folding can be viewed in terms of energy landscapes, where folding kinetics is considered as a progressive organisation of an ensemble of partially folded structures through which a protein passes {{on its way to the}} folded structure. This has been described in terms of a folding funnel, in which an unfolded protein has a large number of conformational states available and there are fewer states available to the folded protein. A funnel implies that for protein folding there is a decrease in energy and loss of entropy with increasing tertiary structure formation. The local roughness of the funnel reflects kinetic traps, corresponding to the accumulation of misfolded intermediates. A folding chain progresses toward lower intra-chain free-energies by increasing its compactness. The chain's conformational options become increasingly narrowed ultimately <b>toward</b> <b>one</b> native structure.|$|E
25|$|Italian {{scientist}} Giovanni Battista Riccioli and {{his assistant}} Francesco Maria Grimaldi described the effect in connection with artillery in the 1651 Almagestum Novum, writing that rotation of the Earth should cause a cannonball fired to the north to deflect to the east. In 1674 Claude François Milliet Dechales described in his Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus how {{the rotation of the}} earth should cause a deflection in the trajectories of both falling bodies and projectiles aimed <b>toward</b> <b>one</b> of the planet's poles. Riccioli, Grimaldi, and Dechales all described the effect as part of an argument against the heliocentric system of Copernicus. In other words, they argued that the Earth's rotation should create the effect, and so failure to detect the effect was evidence for an immobile Earth. The Coriolis acceleration equation was derived by Euler in 1749 and the effect was described in the tidal equations of Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1778.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, {{senior adviser}} to the Hanshin Tigers Senichi Hoshino, who was manager of the club when they won the CL {{championship}} the previous year, argued to keep the current two-league format. He heavily criticized team owners for ignoring the voices of the players and fans, and it is believed that this criticism helped cause some team owners to abandon the movement <b>toward</b> <b>one</b> league. Not long after Hoshino's comments, Tigers team president Katsuyoshi Nozaki suddenly declared he was in favor of keeping the Central and Pacific League set-up and the team became the biggest supporter of the idea. Soon, the majority of the other CL teams also favored the current two-league system. After garnering the support of fellow CL teams the Yakult Swallows and the Yokohama BayStars, Tigers' executives planned a meeting with all of the Central League teams excluding the Giants to attempt to draft an agreement against the move to a one-league system. Tigers' president Katsuyoshi Nozaki proposed interleague play as a possible solution. He claimed that interleague play would allow Central and Pacific League teams to play each other an equal amount of times so that it would seem that it was a one-league system, however the All-Star Series and the Japan Series could be saved. In the past, interleague play had been rejected by the CL teams because they did not want the PL teams to cut into the money they would receive from games played against the hugely popular Giants. Soon the last two CL teams, the Chunichi Dragons and the Hiroshima Carp, both expressed support for maintaining the two-league system, at least through the next season.|$|E
