She manipulates {{her way into}} <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Secretary of State, where she tells him that the supposed meteor is really a planet, and that the heroes they tried to destroy can save them. They agree to give the heroes a chance, but give them only five minutes. In the Kent barn, Clark is attacked by Darkseid possessing Lionel's body. Jor-El taps into Clark's thoughts, showing him images of his trials over the past 10 years, revealing that his entire life has been one big trial leading to this moment. Harnessing the ability to fly, Clark smashes through Lionel's body, destroying it, and {{makes his way to}} the Fortress of Solitude. There, the spirit of his father, Jonathan Kent (John Schneider), presents him with the suit Martha made for him, and Clark takes to the sky, saving a crashing Air Force One, and vanquishing Darkseid by pushing Apokolips back into space.|$|E

25|$|By {{the third}} day of his capture, Bryson had earned {{sufficient}} trust from Berdella to persuade him to establish a regime of tying his hands in front of him after his sexual abuse rather than above his head and to the bed upon the excuse that his (Berdella's) doing so was restricting the circulation to his arms; he had also persuaded Berdella to leave a television on within <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> remote control placed between his legs whenever Berdella was out of the room. However, he would later state to investigators that he had thought almost constantly about escaping. The following day, he managed to break free of his restraints by burning through them using a book of matches Berdella had inadvertently left in the room and within his reach when he had left the house to go to his place of work.|$|E

The Snowman can see the stove through a window {{in the house and}} believes it is female. He falls in love.

Opposite the windows stood the Zodiac Settle, which Burges moved from Buckingham Street. Love is the central decorative scheme to <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ceiling painted with medieval cupids, and the walls covered with mythical lovers. Carved figures from the Roman de la Rose decorate the chimneypiece, which Crook considered [...] "one of the most glorious that Burges and Nicholls ever produced". Echoing Crook, Charles Handley-Read wrote, [...] "Working together, Burges and Nicholls had transposed a poem into sculpture with a delicacy that is very nearly musical. The Roman de la Rose has come to life." ...|$|E

Ripley triggers a fire alarm to alert the marines, who rescue them and kill the creatures. Ripley accuses Burke of releasing the facehuggers {{so that they would}} impregnate her and Newt, allowing him to smuggle the embryos past Earth's quarantine, and of planning to kill the rest of the marines so that no one could contradict his version of events. Before the marines can execute Burke in response to the accusation, the electricity is cut, and aliens assault through the ceiling. Hicks is injured and Newt is captured, but Burke, Gorman, Hudson and Vasquez are killed in the attack.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{adjoining}} Billiards Room, is {{the only}} reception room at Waddesdon Manor to follow the French Renaissance style of the exterior; the other rooms are in broadly 18th-century styles, and contain a magnificent collection of paintings and furniture centred on that century. [...] The segregation of the collection {{was part of the}} concept of what has been called the [...] "neo-Kunstkammer", adopted by some other very wealthy collectors of the period. [...] The Renaissance Room at what is now the Wallace Collection and the collection of Sir Julius Wernher were other examples formed in England over the same period. [...] The neo-Kunstkammer aimed to emulate the collections formed during the Renaissance itself, mostly by princely houses; of these the outstanding survivals were the Habsburg collections in Vienna, Prague and Ambras, as well as the treasuries of the Grünes Gewölbe in Dresden, the Munich Residenz and Kassel. [...] Unlike those collections, contemporary and recent objects were not included.|$|E

500|$|The selectors, after {{a six-hour}} meeting, chose {{the team to}} tour South Africa on 27 August 1968. The {{official}} records of the meeting are incomplete and of those present, no one left an account of what happened. Oborne believes that at least ten men were present—the four selectors, Insole, Peter May, Don Kenyon and Alec Bedser; the England captain Colin Cowdrey; Gubby Allen, Billy Griffith, Arthur Gilligan and Donald Carr for the MCC; and possibly Maurice Allom, another MCC member. Oborne suggests {{that one of those}} present might have been acting for the South African government, as Vorster was well-informed about what happened at the meeting and followed events closely. He also observes that, of those present, Allen, Griffith and Gilligan knew from the Cobham letter what would happen if D'Oliveira were selected; he argues that they may have passed the information on to other selectors. Coy, who had been at the Lord's Test, may also have made the South African position clear at the meeting. According to Oborne, [...] "Everyone in <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> possible exception of the Worcestershire skipper Don Kenyon, would have been aware that the selection of D'Oliveira could at best cause difficulties and at worst cause the tour to be cancelled." [...] Fraser-Sampson goes further, suggesting that Insole, and possibly also May, knew the whole story from an early stage.|$|E

2500|$|In Dream Warriors, more of Freddy's backstory is {{revealed}} by the mysterious nun who repeatedly appears to Dr. Gordon. Freddy's mother, Amanda Krueger, was a nurse at the asylum featured in the film. At the time she worked there, a largely abandoned, run-down wing of the asylum was used to lock up entire hordes of the most insane criminals all at once. When Amanda was young, she was accidentally locked into <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> criminals over a holiday weekend. They managed to keep her hidden for days, raping her repeatedly. [...] When she was finally discovered, she was barely alive and was pregnant with the future Freddy Krueger.|$|E
2500|$|Regina later {{arrives with}} a locator spell {{to make their}} {{tracking}} of Emma easier. However, after Henry mentioned that Emma drove off, Hook suspects that Emma went to see Gold, so he sneaks off and makes {{a phone call to}} warn Emma about Gold's deception. Meanwhile, David and Mary Margret decide that it might not be so bad if Emma got rid of her magic and became [...] "normal," [...] which causes Elsa, who overhead their conversation, to sneak out of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> locator potion to try to find Emma on her own. Hook isn't the only one to suspect Gold, as Ingrid soon discovers Gold's plot after he visits her. It turns out that he needs Emma's power, which means that in order to do that, he has betrayed Ingrid by preventing her from taking Emma. When Ingrid tries to stop Gold, he uses a spell that he collected from remnants of the urn, creating a force field to prevent Ingrid from warning Emma or interfering in the events to come. As Ingrid sees Emma traveling to the mansion, Ingrid uses her mirror to send an illusion of her to stop Emma. When Emma sees the sudden appearance of Ingrid's figure {{in the middle of the}} road, her car spins out of control and crashes, causing Emma to temporarily lose consciousness.|$|E

2500|$|On 23 December, losing patience, {{the leaders}} of the {{division}} went to the Reichskanzlei (Chancellery). By that point, the government, the six-man [...] "Council of People's Deputies" [...] that had been in office since 10 November, {{was on the verge of}} breaking apart with increasing differences emerging between its USPD and SPD members. The Volksmarinedivision encountered support from the former but mostly hostility from the latter. The soldiers were ordered to hand over the keys to the Schloss and left. In the afternoon the soldiers' leaders returned, with the keys but also with a group of armed troops that took position in front of the building. According to historian Sebastian Haffner what happened then was as follows: The soldiers' leaders under one Lieutenant Heinrich Dorrenbach gave the keys to Emil Barth, a People's Deputy of the USPD. Barth called Wels and told him that he had received the keys and asked him to hand over the outstanding pay. Wels refused, arguing that he only took orders from Friedrich Ebert who was joint chairman of the [...] "Council of People's Deputies" [...] and had also been handed the authority of government by the last Imperial Chancellor, Maximilian of Baden. When Barth sent the soldiers to Ebert, Ebert refused to see them. On Dorrenbach's orders the troops now closed all access to the Reichskanzlei, occupied <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> telephone switchboard and cut the lines. The Volksbeauftragten were thus under house arrest.|$|E
