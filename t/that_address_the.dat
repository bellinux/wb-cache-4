The framework provides clear definitions of brain dysfunction, specifies empirical data needed for accurate diagnosis, and defines intervention considerations <b>that</b> <b>address</b> <b>the</b> complex nature of FASD with the intention to avoid common secondary disabilities.|$|E

500|$|Unlike {{those of}} most sports, {{baseball}} playing fields can vary significantly {{in size and}} shape.

Major league teams often skirt even this rule. For example, at Minute Maid Park, which became the home of the Houston Astros in 2000, the Crawford Boxes in left field are only [...] from home plate.
