50|$|The main {{inspiration}} for the installation Erasmus <b>the</b> <b>Clown</b> is <b>the</b> painting <b>Clown</b> (1940-41) by <b>the</b> Dutch artist Charley Toorop (1891 - 1955).

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{significance}} of the presence of <b>the</b> <b>clown</b> in <b>the</b> work of Samuel Beckett. An attempt is made to indicate the parallels between <b>the</b> <b>clown</b> and “existential man” and to show, by means of a discussion of his stage plays in particular, how the image of man as clown is central to Beckett’s work, shaping form as well as providing content. [...] The work is divided into three main sections, the first of which deals with <b>the</b> <b>clown,</b> <b>the</b> second with “existential man” and the third with the art of Samuel Beckett. Sections I and II function as a background against which the assessment of Beckett’s art as incorporating and fusing both traditions can be fully appreciated. [...] Section I, “He Who Gets Slapped: <b>The</b> <b>Clown</b> down <b>the</b> Ages”, deals with the characteristics of various clowns throughout history. From this discussion an image of <b>the</b> <b>clown</b> as outsider emerges: <b>the</b> <b>clown</b> is rejected and thwarted at every level of existence. This cosmic reject, however, never gives up the struggle in a universe alien to him. [...] Section II, “The Existentialists: Man as Clown”, makes clear the nexus between <b>the</b> <b>clown</b> and “existential man” by means of an exploration of the situation of the latter as set forth in the writings of Pascal, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Jaspers, Sartre and Camus. The discussion reveals that <b>the</b> <b>clown</b> is <b>the</b> concrete manifestation of “existential man”. [...] Section III, “The Art of Samuel Beckett: the Res Itself”, show (through an examination of his stage plays) that Beckett makes use of <b>the</b> <b>clown</b> as a vehicle for realizing in art the experience of “existential man”. <b>The</b> <b>clown</b> as image of man is central to his work: by means of <b>the</b> <b>clown</b> Beckett has externalized the inner experience of the individual in all its complexity and has given form to a grim yet essentially affirmative vision of man...|$|R

500|$|The film's {{original}} title was simply Killer Klowns, but the filmmakers added the words [...] "from Outer Space" [...] to prevent audiences from assuming {{the film was}} a slasher movie.
