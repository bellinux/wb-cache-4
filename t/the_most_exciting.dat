5|$|Harry Elmer Barnes {{called the}} book one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> and {{challenging}} {{in the field}} of education since Émile. (This said, Hartup of Contemporary Psychology said Summerhill was closer to Freud's Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality than to Émile and criticized Neill's psychoanalytic overemphases.) The psychoanalyst Benjamin Wolstein put Neill's work alongside that of John Dewey, and Sir Herbert Read likened Neill to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and Henry Caldwell Cook. David Carr characterized the book as centered on moral education, despite Neill's recurrent insistence on the danger of moral teachings. Scholar Richard Bailey agreed with Carr's characterization.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Las Vegas Sun critic John Katsilometes, {{after being}} unimpressed by the initial show, said Believe had {{improved}} {{by reducing the}} narrative elements and focusing on the magic. In 2011, the Toronto Star wrote: “The show is easily <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> thing now on stage in Vegas!” That year the show attracted an estimated $150 million in ticket sales. The show currently has a ten-year performance contract that runs through 2019, and was the best selling magic show in Las Vegas as of 2013.|$|E

5|$|Before Live and Let Die {{had been}} published, the {{producer}} Alexander Korda had read a proof {{copy of the}} novel. He thought it was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> story he had read for years, but was unsure whether it was suitable for a film. Nevertheless, {{he wanted to show}} the story to the directors David Lean and Carol Reed for their impressions, although nothing came of Korda's initial interest. In 1955, following the television broadcast of an adaptation of Fleming's earlier novel Casino Royale, Warner Bros. expressed an interest in Live and Let Die, and offered $500 for an option, against $5,000 if the film was made. Fleming thought the terms insufficient and turned them down.|$|E
5|$|The chariots {{themselves}} were modified war chariots, essentially wooden carts with two wheels {{and an open}} back, although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle. The charioteer's feet were held in place, but the cart rested on the axle, so the ride was bumpy. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> part of the chariot race, {{at least for the}} spectators, was the turns at the ends of the hippodrome. These turns were very dangerous and often deadly. If a chariot had not already been knocked over by an opponent before the turn, it might be overturned or crushed (along with the horses and driver) by the other chariots as they went around the post. Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him to crash was technically illegal, but nothing could be done about it (at Patroclus' funeral games, Antilochus in fact causes Menelaus to crash in this way,) and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Jennifer Crittenden. She came into the writers' room and pitched {{the idea that there}} should be a teachers' strike in an episode. Then-show runner David Mirkin thought the episode had a lot of potential, and much of it is based on his {{experience}} as a child with schools running out of money. Despite the title of the episode, at no point does the PTA (Parent-Teacher Association) actually disband. The title was suggested by Mirkin and was intended to poke fun at Crittenden, who thought <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> part of the teachers going on strike would be that the PTA might disband. In addition to this, Mirkin added a character to the episode who, on thinking the PTA has disbanded, jumps panicking out of a window. He jumps back in the same window when he is told the PTA has not disbanded.|$|E

5|$|The 1930 season saw the Australians tour England, Bradman's first tour. Over five Tests, {{the young}} Australian scored 974 {{runs in a}} {{flawless}} batting display to break Hammond's record run aggregate and average set in the 1928–29 series. While Bradman dominated, Hammond found {{it very difficult to}} play the leg spin bowling of Clarrie Grimmett, who dismissed him five times. Hammond scored 306 runs at an average of 34.00, passing fifty just twice. He batted over five hours for a match-saving 113 in the third Test. On a difficult pitch and with little support, he made a hard-hitting 60 in the final Test in a losing cause. The visitors took the series 2–1, and the newspapers unfavourably compared Hammond's scoring with Bradman's. Later in the season, Hammond scored 89 for Gloucestershire in a tied match against the Australians which he described as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>exciting</b> of his career. One player said that he had never seen Hammond as excited as he was {{at the conclusion of the}} game. In all first-class cricket that season, he scored 2,032 runs (average 53.47) and for Gloucestershire, he came top of the batting averages as the club finished second in the Championship. He took 30 wickets, including match figures of 12 for 74 against Glamorgan.|$|E
