Forty five patients with benign <b>vascular</b> sexual <b>headache</b> were reviewed. Twenty seven (60 %) experienced benign <b>vascular</b> sexual <b>headache</b> alone and eighteen (40 %) had experienced both benign <b>vascular</b> sexual <b>headache</b> and benign exertional headache {{on at least one}} occasion. The mean age was 34. 3 years with a male:female ratio of 5. 4 : 1. Thirty patients with a history of benign <b>vascular</b> sexual <b>headache</b> were followed for an average of 74 months. A personal history of migraine was found in 47 % of cases and a family history of migraine in 30 %. Forty one per cent of patients with benign <b>vascular</b> sexual <b>headache</b> alone had recurrences after diagnosis, and stress and fatigue were considered major contributing factors to the initial and recurrent headache. Nine patients had experienced benign <b>vascular</b> sexual <b>headache</b> and benign exertional headache within 72 hours of each other on at least one occasion, often with a residual headache between the two. Four patients experienced their benign <b>vascular</b> sexual <b>headache</b> and benign exertional headache separated by months to years.

40|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>vascular</b> <b>headache</b> is migraine. Migraine {{headaches}} are usually characterized by severe pain on one or both sides of the head, an upset stomach, and, at times, disturbed vision. Women are {{more likely than men to}} have migraine headaches. When headaches occur three or more times a month, preventive treatment is usually recommended. Drug therapy, biofeedback training, stress reduction, and elimination of certain foods from the diet are the most common methods of preventing and controlling migraine and other <b>vascular</b> <b>headaches.</b> One of the most commonly used drug for the relief of migraine symptoms is Sumatriptan. Other drugs used to prevent migraine include methysergide maleate, which counteracts blood vessel constriction; propranolol hydrochloride, which reduces the frequency and severity of migraine headaches; ergotamine tartrate, a vasoconstrictor that helps counteract the painful dilation stage of the headache; amitriptyline, an antidepressant; valproic acid, an anticonvulsant; and verapamil, a calcium channel blocker.

In 1937, the company built a new building on the north edge of town. In that same year, the manager of the company, Lester R. Peel, started production of ergot. Local farmers were discarding rye that was infected with sclerotia growths, because the ergot could cause deadly poisoning.

40|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950 s and the {{beginning}} of the 1960 s, many desperate cluster headache (CH) patients came to the Headache Center of Florence, the only one in Europe at the time, to be examined. I was there… Horton’s headache era More than 60 years ago Graham and Wolff [1, 2] pro-posed the vascular theory of migraine and related vascu-lar headaches. At that time the clinical feature of the cur-rent CH syndrome was considered a migraine variant and therefore headache phase was attributed to painful dilatation and distension of the cephalic blood vessels. In 1939 Horton et al. [3] described cluster attack features, including increased temperature of the symptomatic side of the forehead and he reported the experience in treat-ing this new <b>vascular</b> <b>headache</b> syndrome with hista-mine. But only in 1956, when Horton detailed the pain and its associated symptoms, did the syndrome become generally known [4]. However, Horton focused on the symptoms of episodes, omitting a description of the peri-odicity of occurrences. Therefore he considered this syn-drome a <b>vascular</b> <b>headache</b> with chronic recurrent brief attacks similar to migraine. Horton used the term “hista-minic cephalgia ” [5] or “cephalalgia ” [6], as he attrib-uted this vascular painful syndrome to the potent vasodilator agent histamine. In many circles this form of headache has been called Horton’s headache in his hon-our. Apart from acetylcholine, at that time histamine was the only known vasodilatative substance capable of explaining the vasodilatation phase of the so-called vas-cular headaches. Horton focused on the presumed role of histamine as an inducing factor of CH attacks as well as their prevention with histaminic desensitisation, and ha...|$|R

Pizotifen is one of a range of medications used for this purpose, other options include propranolol, topiramate, valproic acid and amitriptyline. While pizotifen is reasonably effective, its use is limited by side effects, principally drowsiness and weight gain, and it is usually not the first choice medicine for preventing migraines, instead being used as an alternative when other drugs have failed to be effective. It is not effective in relieving migraine attacks once in progress. Pizotifen has also been reported as highly effective in a severe case of erythromelalgia, a rare neurovascular disease that is sometimes refractory to the other drugs named above.|$|R

A selective and sensitive method, based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS 2), has been developed for quantifying ergotamine in biological fluids with use of a quick and easy sample preparation. Ergotamine and the internal standard, trideuterated lysergic acid diethylamide, were extracted from human urine, blood, and hair by means of liquid-liquid extraction at alkaline pH. Gradient elution on a cyanopropyl column was used for chromatographic separation. Positive ion electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry determination by collision-induced dissociation were performed in an ion trap mass spectrometer. The method was validated and successfully applied to a case of iatrogenic ergotism resulting from the intake of ergotamine tartrate for treating headache. For the first time, ergotamine was identified and quantified in hair.

40|$|Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is {{involved}} in the underlying pathophysiology of all <b>vascular</b> <b>headaches,</b> including migraines. Elevated levels of CGRP during migraine are restored to normal coincident with headache relief after treatment with the antimigraine drug sumatriptan. We have used primary cultures of trigeminal neurons under conditions simulating migraine pathology and therapy to study the mechanisms controlling the CGRP promoter. Using reporter genes in transient transfection assays, we demonstrate that an 18 bp enhancer containing a helix–loop – helix element is both necessary and sufficient for full promoter activity. NGF treatment and cotransfection with an upstream activator of the extracellular signal-regulated MAP kinases (MAPKs) activated the enhancer. Treatment with sumatriptan repressed NGF- and MAPK-stimulated CGRP promoter activity. Repression was also observed using a synthetic MAPK-responsive reporter gene. Sumatriptan regulation of CGRP gene expression did not couple to a Gi /Go pathway, but rather caused a prolonged increase in intracellular calcium. The importance of the prolonged calcium signal in repression of MAPK activity was demonstrated by using the ionophore ionomycin to mimic sumatriptan action. We propose that activation of MAPK pathways may increase CGRP gene expression during migraine, and that sumatriptan can diametrically oppose that activation via a prolonged elevation of intracellular calcium...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{data point}} to a {{determinant}} role for endothelial cell (EC) anionic sites in the regulation of vascular permeability. Previous {{studies have shown that}} EC anionic sites density is reduced in conditions of enhanced permeability. The pathophysiology of migraine and <b>vascular</b> <b>headache</b> encompasses dilatation of dural vessels and extravasation of plasma proteins. The current study was carried out to determine if the density of EC anionic sites is reduced in enhanced permeability of dural vessels. Enhanced permeability was chemically induced in rats by intravenous injection of substance P and was tested by assessing leakage of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Anionic sites were labelled with cationic colloidal gold and their density was quantified from electron microscopy negatives. Experimental animals showed increased leakage of HRP from dural vessels. However, anionic sites in EC membranes (luminal and abluminal) showed no statistical differences when their mean densities in experimental and control animals were compared. The results indicate that in this model, factors other than the density of anionic sites may be important determinants in the permeability of dural vessels. Such factors may include structural alteration of ECs consistent with an increased permeability. In this study pronounced ultrastructural changes in ECs were noted in experimental animals including widening of intercellular junctions and {{an increase in the number}} of EC gaps and vesicles.
