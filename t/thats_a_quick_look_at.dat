50|$|Of {{particular}} interest in this election was {{a study conducted by}} Princeton University in 2005. They found <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> at <b>a</b> candidate’s photograph — a one-second exposure — created <b>an</b> initial impression <b>that</b> often lasted through the more deliberative process <b>that</b> helps <b>a</b> voter decide. The researchers showed study participants photos of Tim Michels and Russ Feingold, and were able to predict the outcome of the election based solely on facial appearances.|$|R
60|$|She {{did not see}} Susie, {{but knew}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> of anguish crossed her face. Margaret drew Arthur towards her. His hands began to tremble. He had never ventured to express the passion that {{consumed}} him, and when he kissed her it was with <b>a</b> restraint <b>that</b> was almost brotherly. Now their lips met. Forgetting that anyone else was in the room, he flung his arms around Margaret. She had never kissed him in that way before, and the rapture was intolerable. Her lips were like living fire. He could not take his own away. He forgot everything. All his strength, all his self-control, deserted him. It crossed his mind that at this moment he would willingly die. But the delight of it {{was so great that}} he could scarcely withhold a cry of agony. At length Susie's voice reminded him of the world.|$|R
60|$|When {{the man in}} {{the black}} coat reached the top he found himself {{at the end of a}} long {{apartment}} as large as a chapel and as low as a malt-room, across which ran parallel carpenters' benches to the number of twenty or more, a gangway being left at the side for access throughout. Behind every bench there stood a man or two, planing, fitting, or chiselling, as the case might be. The visitor paused for a moment, as if waiting for some cessation of their violent motions and uproar till he could make his errand known. He waited ten seconds, he waited twenty; but, beyond <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> had been thrown upon him by every pair of eyes, the muscular performances were in no way interrupted: every one seemed oblivious of his presence, and absolutely regardless of his wish. In truth, the texture of that salmon-coloured skin could be seen to be aristocratic without a microscope, and the exceptious artizan has an offhand way when contrasts are made painfully strong by an idler of this kind coming, gloved and brushed, into the very den where he is sweating and muddling in his shirt-sleeves.|$|R
40|$|A book of {{quotations}} {{is always}} suspect, {{and one on}} Leopold doubly so. The form suggests hagiography, which Leopold scholarship does not need, or the desire to make accessible an important but obscure body of thought, {{which is not the}} case with Leopold. Even more alarming, the editors have arranged Leopold 2 ̆ 7 s ideas into categories, although one of his great strengths was his willingness to think across intellectual boundaries. Dipping into the collection, however, allays all fears. This volume gives the general reader a good, well-organized look at Leopold 2 ̆ 7 s ideas. Scholars get a lot more: a wealth of quotations for lectures and papers, <b>an</b> arrangement <b>that</b> allows <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> at changes in Leopold 2 ̆ 7 s thought, and <b>a</b> whole <b>that</b> provides <b>a</b> helpful guide to his developing ideas...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} of robot capabilities with extravehicular activity (EVA) equipment looks at how improvements in dexterity are enabling robots to perform tasks {{once thought to}} be beyond machines. The approach is qualitative, using the Robonaut system at the Johnson Space Center (JSC), performing task trials <b>that</b> offer <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> <b>look</b> at this system's high degree of dexterity and the demands of EVA. Specific EVA tools attempted include tether hooks, power torque tools, and rock scoops, as well as conventional tools like scissors, wire strippers, forceps, and wrenches. More complex EVA equipment was also studied, with more complete tasks that mix tools, EVA hand rails, tethers, tools boxes, PIP pins, and EVA electrical connectors. These task trials have been ongoing over an 18 month period, as the Robonaut system evolved to its current 43 degree of freedom (DOF) configuration, soon to expand to over 50. In each case, the number of teleoperators is reported, with rough numbers of attempts and their experience level, with a subjective difficulty rating assigned to each piece of EVA equipment and function. JSC' s Robonaut system was successful with all attempted EVA hardware, suggesting new options for human and robot teams working together in space...|$|R
