40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which human capital and career decisions are affected by their potential returns in the marriage market. Although schooling and career decisions often are made before getting married, these decisions are likely to affect the future chances of receiving a marriage offer, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>offer,</b> and the probability of getting divorced. Therefore, I estimate a forward‐looking model of the marriage and career decisions of young men between the ages of 16 and 39. The results show that if there were no returns to career choices in the marriage market, men would tend to work less, study less, and choose blue‐collar jobs over white‐collar jobs. These findings suggest that the existing literature underestimates the true returns to human capital investments by ignoring their returns in the marriage market. ...|$|E
3000|$|Recently, {{different}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> {{products and}} <b>offers</b> are proposed {{along with the}} development of a credit card market. To maximize the profit, companies are interested in which <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>offers</b> can provide an impact on consumers’ behavior more and further stimulate them more to borrow money. Jappelli (1990) has discussed who is credit constrained in the U.S. economy and this study could be helpful to credit card companies. Later, Musto and Souleles (2006) used a unique panel dataset of credit bureau records to measure the [...] "covariate risk" [...] of individual consumers and provided insight into the nature of the shocks hitting different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> consumers. Previous studies only analyzed a single <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>offers</b> by card companies. For example, Shui and Ausubel (2004) examined the pre-approved solicitation offer. Agarwal et al. (2007) analyzed federal income tax rebate to consumers. As an extension of such balance transfer offer analyses, this research investigates business implications by comparing between the cash back and the balance transfer in order to examine which offer is more profitable to credit card companies.|$|R

30|$|This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>offer</b> (C) is {{attractive}} to consumers than the baseline offer (A) {{because there is no}} maximized BT fee. The third section of Table  6 and Fig.  5 describes the result of total and monthly effects in terms of the coefficients. The total payment significantly declines with an increase in PR, but the total payment effect to FFL and the total spending effect are not significant in this offer. The only significant effect for ΔDebt is ΔCCC balance for FFL. It declines $ 101.83 if FFL increases by 1 percent. This indicates that most of the consumers borrow less if interest rates are higher regardless of FFL or PR offers. The interesting result here is that the signs of ΔCCC balance coefficients and ΔPB balance coefficients are opposite with the signs of ΔEFX balance coefficients, which tells that consumers will borrow more money from other banks if interest rates of offer in examined bank are increased.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the returns to career {{decisions in the}} marriage market and the returns to marital choices {{in the labor market}}. Theoretically, investments in the labor market could affect the chances of receiving a marriage offer, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>offer,</b> and the probability of getting divorced. Also, marital status could affect one’s outcomes in the labor market, most notably the “marriage premium” in wages. To untangle this simultaneous decision-making process, I develop a dynamic programming model of the joint career and marital decisions of young men between the ages of 16 and 39. The results show that labor market decisions are strongly influenced by their returns in the marriage market. If there were no returns to career choices in the marriage market, men would tend to work less, study less, and choose blue-collar jobs over white-collar jobs. These results suggest that the existing literature under{{estimates the}} true returns to human capital investments by ignoring their returns in the marriage market. In addition, the results show that the “marriage premium ” is much lower than traditional OLS estimates, and is virtually non-existent for higher wage men. This result suggests that while marriage may make low wage men more serious about their careers, marriage has little effect on high wage men who are already highly motivated...|$|E

Underpricing of Initial Public Offerings in New Zealand: A Comparison of the Fixed Price and Book-Build Methods The paper compares the characteristics of firms that conduct their initial public offering as a book-build with firms that make a traditional fixed price offer. The choice of the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>offer</b> to make appears to be based on gross proceeds. However, there is no clear dollar value that separates the offer types firms choose. While there are clear differences in the characteristics of the companies whose directors chose the alternate offer types there is no difference in underpricing between the two mechanisms. While the result appears inconsistent with prior research, it is argued that because the number of securities that can be allocated is fixed the organising broker needs to increase the level of underpricing to compensate investors for truthfully revealing private information in a book-build. We document evidence consistent with the partial adjustment theory from a jurisdiction with institutional arrangements different from those in which the theory has previously been tested. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the uptake and acceptability of different methods {{of a universal}} offer of voluntary HIV testing to pregnant women. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial involving four combinations of written and verbal communication, followed by the direct offer of a test. The control group received no information and no direct offer of a test, although testing was available on request. SETTING: Hospital antenatal clinic covering most {{of the population of}} the city of Edinburgh. SUBJECTS: 3024 pregnant women booking at the clinic over a 10 month period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Uptake of HIV testing and women's knowledge, satisfaction, and anxiety. RESULTS: Uptake rates were 6 % for those in the control group and 35 % for those directly offered the test. Neither the style of leaflet nor the length of discussion had an effect on uptake. Significant independent predictors of uptake were a direct test offer; the midwife seen; and being unmarried, previously tested, and younger age. Knowledge of the specific benefits of testing increased with the amount of information given, but neither satisfaction nor anxiety was affected by the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>offer.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The universal offer of HIV testing is not intrusive and is acceptable to pregnant women. A policy of offering the HIV test to all women resulted in higher uptake and did not increase anxiety or dissatisfaction. Uptake depends more on the midwife than the method of offering the test. Low uptake rates and inadequate detection of HIV infection point to the need to assess a more routine approach to testing...|$|E
30|$|Position of {{this study}} This {{research}} {{is interested in the}} BT offer effect to consumers and attempts to compare the two types of offers (i.e., BT offer and cash back) in a credit card market. Since the cash-back offer has been examined in previous studies, this study focuses upon the BT offer and compares it with the cash-back offer. This research is different from the other previous contributions in terms of the three concerns. First, the BT is a special offer that is different from regular credit card offers. Some studies have assessed the estimation with respect to decision of contracts with different introductory interest rates and different duration periods, as found in Shui and Ausubel (2004). However, the BT offer needs to incorporate two more parameters besides a promotional interest rate (PR) and a promotional duration (PD) used in the previous studies. The additional two parameters are a fixed-for-life interest rate (FFL) and a maximum fee. As a result of the additional two parameters, this study can measure their decision making of consumers that have more options on credit cards. Second, consumers’ behavior and their choices are related to each other. For example, if consumers only want to enjoy a low interest rate benefit of the BT offer, they choose PR offer because it has the lower interest rate than FFL and pay off the debt before the end of promotion. If consumers have a budget constraint, they cannot pay off their debt at the end of promotion. Therefore, they prefer FFL offer to enjoy the benefit without a limitation of promotion duration. This study implements the analysis considering both consumers’ choices (e.g., which offer they select or reject) and consumers’ behaviors (e.g., how to use their choices for debt payment or spending). Finally, this study attempts to investigate which strategy is more effective on impacting consumers’ finance conditions. No research has examined this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>offer</b> and compared two types of offers by credit card companies. Consequently, it is expected that the empirical results obtained this study will be able to guide credit card companies in preparing business rules and further improving their profitability measures.|$|E

40|$|URL] European {{market of}} {{management}} consultancy (MC) {{and human resources}} (HR) goes remarkably well as revealed by the statistics of {{the total amount of}} businesses of this sector, which amount to 61. 6 billion euros at the end of 2006. It is an increase of almost 14 % on the amount in 2004. The FEACO (in English: European Federation of Management Consultancy Associations), which was created in 1960, is an independent professional organization with non lucrative goal. Recently, the FEACO founded a new grid of reading of the activities carried out by the management consultancy companies. It has the role of representing and of promoting Management Consultancy profession in Europe. In the spheres of the professionals in HR, the increase in the sales turnover in the field remains partly ascribable to the actions of their federation. As for the French HR market, it follows a strong marketing policy directed towards the innovation of the services and the respect of the ethical values of the profession. So many companies try to increase their market presence {{as a result of the}} putting in place of a network offer and of creation of new services panel. The objective of this contribution is to present a study and an analysis of existing works concerning the innovating Web service in human resources consultancy. It is a question of observing new related activities to management consultancy and human resources market: training consultancy, assessment of competences, staff consultancy, management consultancy, experience validation and accompaniment. In this study we have reports of certain great sites, by their notoriety due to a true indexing work and a good marketing policy, which succeed in monopolizing a great part of the market. In opposite, very few large cabinets opt for this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>offer</b> of on-line HR services (e-HR). The problems exposed in this study make it possible to clarify a decisional problem for an e-HR decision maker. It is a stage of thought synchronization between the watchers and the decision maker in order to be able to reformulate the problem (of the decision maker) and to lock the research stakes. This move respects the transitions between the phases of economic intelligence process. We will develop, in particular, a project which we have carried out with a French company for the construction of a strategic information system within the framework of competence management.

40|$|Firms often search enthusiastically for {{distinguishing}} {{traits that}} they may use to price discriminate between segments. Yet there are occasions in which firms forgo the opportunity to price discriminate and instead charge a single price. Traditional explanations for why retailers forgo the opportunity to price discriminate focus {{on the cost of}} discriminating, including operational costs, explicit discrimination costs, and implicit discrimination costs. In this paper we identify an additional reason for why firms may forgo an opportunity to price discriminate. By revealing that a product is being sold to a broad range of segments, a retailer implicitly claims that the product is suitable for each segment. However, claiming that a premium-quality product is suitable for price-sensitive consumers undermines the credibility of a retailer's quality claim. The signaling explanation was motivated by extensive discussions over more than a year with a major catalog retailer that sells premium-quality jewelry and gifts. Discussions with managers revealed that they were reluctant to use any price-discrimination mechanism that signals their products are targeted at price-sensitive customers. For example, the catalog does not include sale or clearance sections and does not target more price-sensitive customers by using separate items. However, management was under some pressure to consider installment-billing offers, which allow customers to pay over a series of periods rather than in a lump sum. Management feared that offering installment billing may adversely affect customers' quality perceptions and demand. To investigate this issue, we develop a general game-the-oretic model, illustrate how the model extends to installment billing, and conduct a large-scale field test. The general model illustrates how selling to multiple segments may lead to an adverse quality signal. We illustrate how the model extends to installment-billing offers in a direct-mail catalog. Installment-billing offers allow customers to spread the total payment over a series of payments. All customers have the option of using installment billing, and customers who use the plan receive an economic benefit (an interest-free loan). We would normally expect this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>offer</b> to increase demand or, at a minimum, leave demand unchanged. However, because installment-billing offers target credit-constrained customers, we predicted that the introduction of installment billing would prompt an unfavorable quality inference and reduce demand among quality-sensitive customers. We empirically investigated this prediction in a large-scale field test with a catalog that offers premium-quality jewelry and gifts. Two versions of the catalog were created: a test version that contained an installment-billing offer, and a control version in which installment billing was not offered. Importantly, the prices in both the test version and control version were identical. Approximately 240, 000 catalogs were mailed, and customers were randomly assigned to either the test version or control version. Results show that the installment-billing offer (test version) was associated with both a {{reduction in the number of}} orders received and a reduction in aggregate revenue. Offering installment billing resulted in approximately $ 15, 000 in lost revenue. The only plausible explanation for this counterintuitive finding appears to be the signaling theory. To investigate the long-term effects, the catalog agreed to survey their customers to measure how an offer of installment billing affects their customers' quality perceptions. Similar to the field test, two versions of a catalog were created, and customers were randomly mailed a catalog, along with a short survey. Respondents were asked to browse through the catalog and return their responses in a replypaid envelope. The findings are consistent with customer beliefs in the signaling model: Offering installment billing lowers the perceived quality of the items in the catalog. The field test and survey findings were both statistically significant and managerially relevant. Together, the results convinced the catalog not to include installment-billing offers in future catalogs.
