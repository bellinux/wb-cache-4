40|$|OBJECTIVE: Little {{is known}} about the {{influence}} of different training types on relative fat mobilization with exercise. The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the changes induced by aerobic training (AT), resistance (RT) or a combination of both (AT+RT) on total fat mass (TFM) and regional fat mass (RFM). Further, the relative contribution of different regions, upper limbs (UL), lower limbs (LL), and <b>trunk</b> (<b>Tr),</b> were compared. DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-five overweight and premenopausal women were randomized in either AT, RT or AT+RT. All training groups exercised for the same duration (60 min), 3 times per week for 5 months. Body composition was estimated using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. RESULTS: TFM decreased significantly in all groups (- 4. 6 ± 1. 9 kg; - 3. 8 ± 2. 6 kg, and - 4. 7 ± 3. 0 kg in AT, RT, and AT+RT groups respectively; P < 0. 001). The relative contribution of FM into each segment changed significantly: TrFM represented 46. 6 % ± 5. 8 % of TFM at baseline and reduced to 43. 1 % ± 5. 5 % (P < 0. 001); LLFM was 39. 7 % ± 5. 8 % vs. 41. 6 % ± 5. 7 % (P < 0. 01); ULFM was 11. 3 % ± 1. 3 % vs. 12. 2 % ± 1. 4 % (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: Training type did not influence changes of TFM and RFM. Fat mobilization came predominantly from Tr in all training protocols. These findings suggest that overweight and obese women can reduce TFM and RFM, independently of training type...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} meet the need for {{increased}} communications capacity, NASA is conducting a program to develop technology and systems for a 30 / 20 GHz multibeam domestic U. S. satellite. One way to provide the required national interconnectivity is to permute and time share connections among the involved areas by means of a satellite-borne multiport microwave switch with a Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA) system. In this connection, the question was analyzed whether a practical satellite message routing system can be developed using FDMA techniques. The total traffic (model A) was derived and used as an input specification for the satellite-routed FDMA study. Attention is given to beam isolations, color and regional systems, the level of service, and the color FDMA satellite. It is concluded that the FDMA system considered can handle substantially all the Customer Premises Service (CPS) and <b>Trunking</b> (<b>TR)</b> traffic in Model A.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} voluntary trunk rotation and half-field eye-patching to treat patients with unilateral neglect in stroke. Design: Pre-post, day 60 follow-up, single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Setting: Single-centre inpatient rehabilitation hospital. Subjects: Sixty subacute patients with right hemisphere stroke having unilateral neglect within eight weeks post stroke consented to participate between November 2003 and July 2005. They {{were randomly assigned to}} three comparison groups. Interventions: Nineteen patients received daily experimental training in voluntary <b>trunk</b> rotation (<b>TR)</b> for 1 hour five times a week for 30 days. Twenty patients received the same kind of treatment together with half-field eye-patching (TR + EP). Fifteen patients in the control group received conventional training with the same contact time. Main outcome measures: Patients were assessed on days 0, 30 and 60 using the Behavioural Inattention Test, the Clock Drawing Test, and the Functional Independence Measure. Results: No significant differences between voluntary <b>trunk</b> rotation (<b>TR),</b> voluntary <b>trunk</b> rotation and half-field eye-patching (TR + EP) and controls were found in functional performance and neglect measures at day 30 (P = 0. 042 - 0. 994) and follow-up (P = 0. 052 - 0. 911) at P = 0. 005 using Bonferroni correction. Conclusions: The results of this study do not support the use of voluntary trunk rotation alone or with half-field eye-patching to improve functional performance or reduce unilateral neglect in subacute patients with stroke.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} voluntary trunk rotation and half-field eye-patching to treating patients with unilateral neglect in stroke. Method: A single-blinded randomized controlled trial in an inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Hong Kong. Sixty stroke in-patients with unilateral right lesion having neglect {{were randomly assigned to}} 3 groups: voluntary <b>trunk</b> rotation (<b>TR),</b> voluntary <b>trunk</b> rotation in combination with half-field eye-patching (TR+EP), conventional training (Control). Six subjects dropped out during interventions. Nineteen patients in TR received daily experimental training for 1 hour, five times a week for 30 days. Twenty patients received the same kind of treatment together with half-field eye -patching (TR +EP). Fifteen patients in control received conventional training with same contact time. Patients were assessed before the intervention, at week 4, and follow-up at week 8 by using a battery of neglect measures, the FIM instrument, and the MMSE. Result: Significant differences between TR and Control were found in the gain of FIM scores on transfer, locomotion, and total score from initial assessment to week 4. Neither TR nor TR+EP showed functional improvement and reduction of neglect at follow -up. Conclusion:Voluntary trunk rotation alone improved the motor aspects of patients' functional performance. This was not associated with a reduction of unilateral neglect. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R
40|$|Left visuo-spatial neglect is a well-recognized {{predictor}} of poor functional outcome following right hemisphere stroke. Over the past 60 years, 18 different {{methods have been}} described and evaluated aimed at reducing {{the effects of this}} impairment. Although there are some grounds for optimism particularly in terms of short-term impairment-based effects, the range and degree of disability borne by many patients remain high and the clinical effectiveness of the different methods viewed in terms of long-lasting functional improvement (i. e. improvement of disabilities or handicap) is not clear. A systematic review of the available clinically relevant literature, using comparative and stringent levels of evidence, indicates that visual scanning training (VST), <b>trunk</b> rotation (<b>TR)</b> or repeated neck muscle vibrations (NMV) when associated with an extensive training program, mental imagery training, video feedback training and prism adaptation (PA) can be recommended for the rehabilitation of patients with left neglect. More studies however are needed to determine the optimal paradigm of limb activation (LA) eliciting a sustained functional improvement. Sensory stimulations alone and Fresnel prisms {{do not appear to be}} functionally relevant. For the other methods, the actual literature is not sufficient to conclude whether or not a long-term functional improvement can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} the lateral bending test is {{important}} in the assessment of spinal curve mobility and prediction of surgical outcome in the treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). However, radiographic bending tests are unable to assess the reducibility of trunk asymmetry. This study aims to exploit surface topography measurement in order to evaluate the changes in shape of the trunk (a) between bending and neutral standing positions, and (b) between standing pre- and post-operative visits, in a cohort of adolescents with AIS having undergone surgical correction; and to correlate the differences measured in cases (a) and (b). Our cohort includes 13 patients with right thoracic AIS. Each patient had their 3 D trunk surface digitized with a multi-head InSpeck system in standing posture (at the pre-op and post-op visits) and in maximum voluntary right and left bending (at the pre-op visit). We developed a novel trunk shape analysis method which produces a set of inclined trunk cross-sections allowing comparison between different postures. Two asymmetry indices, <b>trunk</b> rotation (<b>TR)</b> and back surface rotation (BSR), were computed in all cases and a statistical analysis was performed. Our correlation study (Pearson test) showed fair correlations in most cases between the changes in side-bending and those post-surgery, with the strongest relationship (p-value < 0. 01) when combining the TR measurements from both bendings. These results provide evidence that the bending test can be used to assess trunk asymmetry reducibility. The proposed approach could provide a non-invasive trunk asymmetry reducibility test for routine clinical use in AIS surgery planning. CIHR / IRS...|$|R
40|$|Study Design. Reliability study. Objectives. To assess between-acquisition {{reliability}} of new multilevel trunk cross sections measurements, {{in order to}} define what is a real change when comparing 2 trunk surface acquisitions of a same patient, before and after surgery or throughout the clinical monitoring. Summary of Background Data. Several cross-sectional surface measurements have been proposed in the literature for noninvasive assessment of trunk deformity in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). However, only the maximum values along the trunk are evaluated and used for monitoring progression and assessing treatment outcome. Methods. Back surface rotation (BSR), <b>trunk</b> rotation (<b>TR),</b> and coronal and sagittal trunk deviation are computed on 300 cross sections of the trunk. Each set of 300 measures is represented as a single functional data, using a set of basis functions. To evaluate between-acquisition variability at all trunk levels, a test-retest reliability study is conducted on 35 patients with AIS. A functional correlation analysis is also carried out to evaluate any redundancy between the measurements. Results. Each set of 300 measures was successfully described using only 10 basis functions. The test-retest {{reliability of}} the functional measurements is good to very good all over the trunk, except above the shoulders level. The typical errors of measurement are between 1. 20 ° and 2. 2 ° for the rotational measures and between 2 and 6 mm for deviation measures. There {{is a very strong}} correlation between BSR and TR all over the trunk, a moderate correlation between coronal trunk deviation and both BSR and TR, and no correlation between sagittal trunk deviation and any other measurement. Conclusion. This novel representation of trunk surface measurements allows for a global assessment of trunk surface deformity. Multilevel trunk measurements provide a broader perspective of the trunk deformity and allow a reliable multilevel monitoring during clinical follow-up of patients with AIS and a reliable assessment of the esthetic outcome after surgery.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional {{study of}} {{isokinetic}} trunk and knee muscle strength {{in women who}} are obese. OBJECTIVE: To provide reference values, to identify variables that affect peripheral muscle strength, and to provide recommendations for isokinetic testing of trunk and knee muscles in women who are obese and morbidly obese. BACKGROUND: The assessment of peripheral muscle strength is useful for the quantification of possible loss of strength, for exercise prescription, and {{for the evaluation of}} the effect of training programs in obese individuals. METHODS AND MEASURES: Isokinetic trunk and leg muscle strength was assessed in 241 women who were obese (18 - 65 years, body mass index (BMI) > or = 30 kg/m 2). Trunk flexion and extension peak torque (PT) was measured using the Cybex TEF dynamometer; <b>trunk</b> rotation (<b>TR)</b> PT was measured using the Cybex TORSO dynamometer; and knee flexion/extension (KFE) PT was measured using the Cybex 350 dynamometer. Body composition was assessed using the bioelectrical impedance method; physical activity was assessed using the Baecke questionnaire; and peak VO 2 was assessed using an incremental exercise capacity test on a bicycle ergometer. To identify variables related to muscle strength, Pearson correlations were computed and a stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed. RESULTS: Pearson correlation coefficients of all strength measurements at 60 degrees/s revealed low-to-moderate negative associations with age and positive associations with mass, height, fat free mass (FFM), and peak VO 2 (P < 0. 05), except for gravity-uncorrected trunk extension strength, which was not related to mass. The sports index of the Baecke questionnaire was associated with TR PT (r = 0. 20, P < 0. 01) and KFE PT (r = 0. 18, P < 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The weight of the trunk accounts largely for the measured trunk extensor and flexor strength in women who are obese. Contributing variables of isokinetic trunk flexion and extension strength in women who are obese are age, height, and FFM; whereas sports activities and aerobic fitness are contributing factors for trunk rotational and knee extension strength. Recommendations for measuring isokinetic muscle strength in individuals who are obese are provided. status: publishe...|$|R
