5|$|In 1649, {{the town}} is witness to many witch burnings. In the church, the townspeople {{try to figure out}} whom to condemn next. People begin accusing others and soon they erupt into chaos, until Marge intervenes. She tries to talk sense into the townspeople, but Moe accuses her of being a witch. Quimby assures her that she is {{entitled}} to due process which means she will be thrown off a cliff with a broomstick; if she is a witch she will be able to fly to safety, in which case the authorities expect her to report back for punishment. If she is not a witch, then she will fall to an honorable Christian death. After being shoved off the cliff, Marge flies up on the broomstick revealing <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> is a witch and vows to conquer the whole entire town. She returns to her sisters Patty and Selma. The sisters watch Ned and Maude Flanders talking about how the witches eat children, which gives them the notion to do just that. They knock on the Flanders' door and demand their sons, but before they leave, Maude offers the witches gingerbread men instead. The witches like these better than the children so they go to each house, getting goodies in exchange for not eating the children. As they fly off, the Sea Captain says that is how the tradition of Halloween and trick-or-treating started.|$|E
25|$|I am {{sure that}} she was {{frequently}} bewildered by the rapidity and mutability of her own impulses. Possessed, as she was, of an intuitive rather than an analytical intelligence, I doubt <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> understood herself clearly, any more than did {{most of those who}} thought they knew her intimately. An exception in this regard was Daphne du Maurier.|$|E

25|$|Like {{on the two}} {{previous}} stages, Wild powered to victory, outsprinting Lucinda Brand and Marta Tagliaferro. The Dutch rider captured her sixth success on Qatar soil and comforted her overall lead. Wild indeed wins the Ladies Tour of Qatar {{for the third time}} after 2009 and 2010 and shows <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> is the Queen of the event. In the final overall standings, she can enjoy a lead of 14” on Chloe Hosking and 29” on Ellen van Dijk.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the idea}} of working with {{resistance}} is essentially a hypnotic one, it goes beyond hypnosis and trance. In a typical example, a girl that bit her nails was told that she was cheating herself of really enjoying the nail biting. He encouraged her to let some of her nails grow a little longer before biting them, so <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> could derive the fullest pleasure from the activity. She decided to grow all of her nails long enough that she might really enjoy biting them, and then, after some days, she realised that she didn't want to bite them anyway.|$|E
25|$|Harlacher {{grew up in}} Camarillo, California, {{and started}} acting in school plays. When she was around 9–10 years old, she was {{inspired}} by an interview by Christy Carlson Romano who voiced Kim Possible, in which Romano said that with voice acting, {{you could go to}} work in your pajamas. Harlacher's mother responded {{that it was not a}} real job, and suggested she pursue acting only as a hobby. Her first exposure to anime was through Dragonball Z and Pokémon shows, which she considered more like cartoons, and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> got into manga and anime in school when Fruits Basket was being published in English. At La Reina High School, she was active in the Speech and Mock Trial team, which was noted statewide and even attended a national event. She also competed on the school's diving team.|$|E

Lady Dedlock is implicated, but Inspector Bucket reveals that her former maid Hortense is the murderess and had tried to frame Lady Dedlock. Richard and Ada are secretly married, but he is obsessed with the lawsuit, encouraged by John's unscrupulous friend Harold Skimpole and the conniving lawyer Vholes.

25|$|Mark {{takes over}} running the family fruit and {{vegetable}} stall in the market after his uncle, Pete Beale (Peter Dean), leaves. He also begins casually dating his sister's housemate Shelley Lewis (Nicole Arumugam), but is reluctant {{to tell her about}} his HIV status.

When he tries to tell Shelley this, she uses emotional blackmail to stop him, saying that she has risked her health being with him so he owes her.

Jocelyn Vena of MTV News wrote that the song is [...] "about keeping things hot with her man".

In the first verse, Beyoncé sings about how understanding, loyal, and patient her man is.

But what people didn't realise at that time, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> knew, and in fact I didn't even know it when we were making the record, and now looking at the whole thing; she knew that she was in a lot of trouble; that she wasn't going to live. And it wasn't drugs. It was alcohol toward the end... It was such a sad thing because... she was the only singer that really sang what I call the 'right way' because she was a great jazz-pop singer... She was really a great jazz singer. A true jazz singer. And I regret that because that's the 'right way' to sing.|$|E

In interviews, Miley Cyrus {{spoke of the}} implausibility {{of being able to}} keep a secret such as Miley and her family do in the show in a world of intense media scrutiny.

Maura Kelly of The Guardian evaluated the aftermath of the failed wedding of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries, which was documented on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and subsequently caused public outrage, including an online protest petition to cancel the show. [...] "Since Kim doesn't exactly seem to be an exemplar of self-awareness, I suppose it's possible <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>really</b> believed she and Humphries would live happily ever after," [...] Kelly speculated whether or not the marriage was a publicity stunt. [...] "But more likely, she and E! are laughing {{all the way to the}} bank [...] 10.5 million viewers tuned into [...] "Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event", after all," [...] Kelly summarized the controversy.
