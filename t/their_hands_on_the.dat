This was exploited {{two years later}} when Colonel Thomas Blood attempted to steal them. Blood and his accomplices bound and gagged the Jewel House keeper. Although they laid <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Imperial State Crown, Sceptre and Orb, they were foiled when the keeper's son turned up unexpectedly and raised the alarm.|$|E
25|$|On {{successive}} possessions in {{the second}} quarter, Harrell led quick-hitting drives of 53-, 70-, and 54-yards. Freeman, however, misfired on 9 of 10 passes, several of which Tech defenders got <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> Kansas State junior, who a week earlier had become his own school’s career passing leader, was 13-for-28 for 170 yards. Ernie Pierce scored on an 18-yard return of a blocked punt late in the game.|$|E
25|$|Toulon {{remained}} {{one of the}} top French clubs, {{but they}} lost four consecutive finals scattered over 35 years (1948, 1968, 1971 and 1985). The 1985 extra-time defeat by Stade Toulousain left them with a lot of regrets, and playing in the most spectacular final ever (36–22) did nothing to alleviate the pain of losing. The Red and Black only waited two more years to finally lay <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Bouclier de Brennus, as they defeated Racing at the Parc des Princes. The third title came in 1992, against Biarritz Olympique, in Serge Blanco's last match and last chance to win the title.|$|E

25|$|Under Edward VI, John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, {{sponsored}} an act allowing Newcastle to annexe Gateshead as its suburb. The {{main reason}} for this was to allow the Newcastle Hostmen, who controlled the export of Tyne coal, to get <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Gateshead coal mines, previously controlled by the Bishop of Durham. However, when Mary I came to power, Dudley met his downfall and the decision was reversed. The Reformation allowed private access to coal mines previously owned by Tynemouth and Durham priories {{and as a result}} coal exports increase dramatically, from 15,000 tons in 1500 to 35,000 tons in 1565, and to 400,000 tons in 1625.|$|E
25|$|After being {{approved}} {{for participation in}} the J. League S-Pulse competed in the inaugural 1992 J. League Cup and made it to their first final. However, the dream start ended with defeat at the hands of Verdy Kawasaki. In 1993, S-Pulse became one of the ten founder members of the new J. League, and finished third after the 1st and 2nd stages were combined. Their second venture into the J. League Cup was another near miss, again losing in the final to Verdy Kawasaki. Finally, in 1996 the team got <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trophy and also gained revenge on Verdy, beating them 5–4 on penalties in the final.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the number}} of Pomo basket weavers has decreased, their skill and artistic vision is still intact, and people pay a pretty penny to get <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> art. Today, new Pomo baskets might sell {{for as much as}} $1,000, and the more {{historical}} ones might sell for more than $10,000. Dealing of these baskets has not always been so lucrative and many have tried to exploit the artists and communities. Dealers and collectors may have exploited the lucrative basket market, but it still paid well enough to provide income to Pomo women where hunting and gathering were no longer feasible and money was needed for survival.|$|E

25|$|The Rotunda {{is located}} in the centre of the Anastasis, beneath the larger of the church's two domes. In the center of the Rotunda is the chapel called the Aedicule, which {{contains}} the Holy Sepulchre itself. The Aedicule has two rooms, the first holding the Angel's Stone, which is believed to be a fragment of the large stone that sealed the tomb; the second is the tomb itself. Possibly {{due to the fact that}} pilgrims laid <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tomb and/or to prevent eager pilgrims from removing bits of the original rock as souvenirs, a marble plaque was placed in the fourteenth century on the tomb to prevent further damage to the tomb.|$|E
25|$|On {{the final}} {{play of the}} tightly-contested game, rookie Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson threw a Hail Mary pass {{into the end zone}} {{intended}} for wide receiver Golden Tate. Both Tate and Packers defender M. D. Jennings got <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ball while both players were still in the air and attempting to gain possession. The two officials near the play initially gave separate signals of touchdown and touchback, before ruling the players had simultaneous possession, resulting in a Seahawks game-winning touchdown. Prior to the catch, Tate shoved Packers cornerback Sam Shields with both hands, which the NFL later acknowledged should have drawn an offensive pass interference penalty that would have negated the touchdown and resulted in a Packers victory. The lack of a pass interference penalty and the ruling of a touchdown via simultaneous catch were widely questioned {{in the aftermath of the}} game, drawing comments from the game's announcers, NFL players, and the media. The NFL subsequently released a statement defending the touchdown ruling.|$|E
500|$|In {{their book}} Who is the Doctor, Graeme Burk and Robert Smith {{described}} Adam in [...] "Dalek" [...] as [...] "somewhat annoying". Burk {{referred to him}} in [...] "The Long Game" [...] as [...] "arrogant and narcissistic", which made Rose appear shallow for insisting he travel with them, but felt that Langley did [...] "a superb job" [...] conveying the character's flaws. He stated that it was [...] "a shame" [...] that the backstory of Adam's motivations were cut from the script, {{as it would have}} made his character more believable. The two found a logical flaw in the Doctor's decision to drop Adam off, as it was a possibility that someone could get <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> future technology. Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern gave a positive overview of Adam, describing the character as [...] "bumptious yet likeable" [...] and his departure as [...] "literary precision". He commented that Adam [...] "adds an interesting dynamic, subtly different" [...] from Mickey Smith and Captain Jack Harkness, who also worked with Rose and the Ninth Doctor. Instead of threatening the Doctor and Rose's relationship, Adam [...] "serves to strengthen it". In 2010 Mark Harrison of Den of Geek listed the character's exit from the TARDIS as the tenth greatest companion farewell scene stating that it was [...] "great {{to get a glimpse of}} the Doctor outright booting someone out." [...] He felt that the character [...] "struck out in spectacular fashion" [...] by attempting to steal future technology and that his eventual fate was an example of poetic justice. Charlie Jane Anders also praised the concept of Adam's story arc positioning his departure as the seventh most depressing exit from a companion in Doctor Whos history. She felt that to have [...] "a companion who flunks out" [...] was one of Davies' [...] "cleverest ideas" [...] as executive producer of the series and that Adam's human flaws made him relatable. In 2010 readers of the Radio Times voted Adam the 45th most popular companion, out of forty-eight viable options.|$|E

500|$|... 2011's third {{installment}} of the franchise, , has Drake searching for the lost city of Iram of the Pillars, located in the Rub' al Khali Desert. During {{the gap between the}} two games, Drake and Elena married, but then became estranged and are now separated. It is revealed in this game that Drake's past is more mysterious than the player is led to believe. It eventually transpires that Drake is not his real last name (his real last name, Morgan, is not revealed until Uncharted 4) and he was raised in a Catholic orphanage from the age of five. His mother committed suicide and his father handed the child over to the state. He ran away from the orphanage and traveled to Colombia, where, at the age of 15, he acquired Francis Drake's ring (which he has referred to as a family heirloom in the first game) by stealing it from a museum. This led to him teaming up with Victor Sullivan for the first time. With the assistance of Sully, Chloe, and Charlie Cutter, Nate steals valuable historical clues from a mysterious organization led by Katherine Marlowe and her assistant Talbot. They travel to France and Syria where they find clues leading them to Yemen, where Drake reluctantly enlists the help of Elena. They find a celestial map that shows the location of Iram. However, Sully is kidnapped by Marlowe and Talbot, prompting Drake to save him by boarding one of Marlowe's cargo planes. The plane crashes in the Rub' al Khali after a shoot-out ensues but Drake survives. After wandering the desert for days, a group of horsemen, led by Salim, rescue Drake and take him back to their encampment. Salim explains to Drake they must stop Marlowe and Talbot from reaching the lost city so they will not get <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hallucinogenic power of the Djinn. Drake and Salim rescue Sully from Marlowe's caravan and reach the city. Drake and Sully destroy the winch pulling the brass vessel containing the Djinn from the waters causing the whole city to collapse. Marlowe is killed in quicksand and Drake shoots Talbot before he can stab Sully. Drake and Sully escape the sinking city and reunite with Elena back at Yemen. Drake and Elena appear to resolve their marriage and they fly back home on their new sea plane.|$|E

2500|$|Traditional Tuvaluan {{songs are}} very short poems which are repeated.

While Tuvaluan songs convey a dramatic story, the concentrated song structure often omitted reference to key events in the story. Gerd Koch describes traditional Tuvaluan songs: ...|$|E
