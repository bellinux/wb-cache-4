50|$|A {{tire iron}} (also <b>tire</b> <b>lever</b> or tire spoon) is a {{specialized}} metal tool used {{in working with}} tires. Tire irons have not been in common use for automobile tires since the shift {{to the use of}} tubeless tires in the late 1950s.|$|E
5000|$|A common {{feature of}} <b>tire</b> <b>levers</b> {{is the lack}} of sharp edges. The {{slightest}} pinch of an inner tube by a lever can weaken or puncture the tube. It is good practice to examine a set of <b>tire</b> <b>levers</b> for any sharp edges and to file them smooth and round.|$|R

50|$|<b>Tire</b> <b>levers</b> are not {{necessary}} or desirable in all cases. In some cases, the tire can be reinserted on the rim, and sometimes {{removed from the}} rim, {{without the use of}} <b>tire</b> <b>levers.</b> This reduces the chance of puncture caused by pinching the tube between the rim and the tire bead. Sometimes they are used to fit the tire back on, but this can be done without the levers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tire</b> <b>levers</b> {{are used}} for {{removing}} the tires from the rim, often for changing the inner tube. Plastic levers {{are more prone to}} breakage; metal ones damage tubes, tires, or rims more easily.|$|R
50|$|Classically, <b>tire</b> <b>levers</b> {{were made}} of metal. However plastic ones are now {{manufactured}} which are even less sharp {{and less likely to}} puncture the tube. There are also some single-lever varieties, which can be inserted under the bead at one point then quickly pushed around the rim to pop the bead off.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tire</b> <b>levers</b> for bicycle <b>tires</b> {{have one}} end that is tapered and {{slightly}} curved. The other end is usually hooked {{so that it}} can be hooked around a spoke to keep the tire bead free of the rim at one point, allowing a second lever to be manipulated forward, progressively loosening a larger segment of the tire bead from the rim.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Puncture {{repair kit}} with <b>tire</b> <b>levers,</b> {{sandpaper}} to clean off {{an area of}} the inner tube around the puncture, a tube of rubber solution (vulcanizing fluid), round and oval patches, a metal grater and piece of chalk to make chalk powder (to dust over excess rubber solution). Kits often also include a wax crayon to mark the puncture location.|$|R
50|$|For basic {{maintenance}} and repairs cyclists can carry a pump (or a CO2 cartridge), a puncture repair kit, a spare inner tube, and <b>tire</b> <b>levers</b> {{and a set of}} allen keys. Cycling can be more efficient and comfortable with special shoes, gloves, and shorts. In wet weather, riding can be more tolerable with waterproof clothes, such as cape, jacket, trousers (pants) and overshoes and high-visibility clothing is advisable to reduce the risk from motor vehicle users.|$|R
50|$|On the road, {{the easiest}} {{approach}} to a flat tire, should a spare inner tube be available, is to replace the tube. The wheel is removed, the <b>tire</b> <b>levered</b> from the rim and inspected for causes of damage, and the inner tube replaced and wheel inflated. Re-inflation {{can be carried out}} by the use of a frame mounted pump or a CO2 cartridge inflator. The CO2 cartridge is generally a single use item only while the pump can be used to inflate many flat tires. The inner tube may then be repaired at a later date.|$|R
2500|$|There are {{specialized}} bicycle {{tools for}} use {{both in the}} shop and on the road. Many cyclists carry tool kits. These may include a tire patch kit (which, in turn, may contain any combination of a hand pump or CO2 Pump, <b>tire</b> <b>levers,</b> spare tubes, self-adhesive patches, or tube-patching material, an adhesive, a piece of sandpaper or a metal grater (for roughing the tube surface to be patched), Special, thin wrenches are often required for maintaining various screw fastened parts, specifically, the frequently lubricated ball-bearing [...] "cones". [...] and sometimes even a block of French chalk.), wrenches, hex keys, screwdrivers, and a chain tool. There are also cycling specific multi-tools that combine many of these implements into a single compact device. More specialized bicycle components may require more complex tools, including proprietary tools specific for a given manufacturer.|$|R
