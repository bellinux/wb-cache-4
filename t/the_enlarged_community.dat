40|$|By {{articulating}} discourse {{theory to}} build on the concepts of 'strategic culture', 'security culture' and 'grand strategy', we argue that the European Union has adopted a 'global power' approach since approximately 1999, having been previously constituted as a 'civilian power' since the 1970 s. We suggest this paradigmatic shift was influenced by a growing discourse coalition of 'euro-strategists', which mobilized to prevent another European foreign policy failure like the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990 s. While this project remains in its infancy, it has already led to the articulation and institutionalization of a new vision of security within <b>the</b> <b>enlarged</b> European <b>community.</b> Indeed, we contend that the continued expansion of this 'global power' approach is likely to have profound implications for the future of European integration, potentially leading to a deeper and more tightly unified European geopolitical space.

We distinguish an EC `core' (Germany and its immediate neighbours) and an EC periphery (UK and the Southern European members of the Community). Austria, Sweden and Switzerland display more similarity to the EC core than do Finland, Iceland and Norway.

40|$|Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton {{have made}} the {{promotion}} of democracy abroad the "third pillar" of their administrations' foreign policy. In his 1995 National Security Strategy, President Clinton states that "All of American Strategic interests [...] are served by <b>enlarging</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> of democratic and free nations. " However, the theory underpinning this strategy is not well developed. In fact, the policy directly conflicts with the realist analytical framework that dominates current international diplomacy. Recent empirical studies in international relations have confirmed the statistical evidence of a separate peace among democratic nations. Few militarized disputes, and perhaps no wars have occurred between democracies. However, the causes of this phenomenon remain controversial. Up until now, efforts to explain the democratic peace phenomena {{have focused on the}} existence of domestic norms and institutions within democracies. Hegemonic stability theory provides insight for a new plausible explanation of the democratic peace proposition. Statistical analyses of interstate dispute data indicate that two centuries of liberal hegemony have, at least partially, been responsible for the separate democratic peace.

Furthermore, <b>enlarging</b> <b>the</b> innovation <b>community</b> and reducing entry barriers for Start-up companies and SMEs in generating IP accelerate the innovation process and generate a series of new challenges, such as increased pressure for early filing of patent applications, increased risk of unknown parallel inventions, reduced time for further developing IP, and increased barriers for venture capital funding.

40|$|Corpus Workbench (CWB) is a widely-used {{architecture}} for corpus analysis, {{originally designed}} at the IMS, University of Stuttgart (Christ 1994). It {{consists of a}} set of tools for indexing, managing and querying very large corpora with multiple layers of word-level annotation. CWB’s central component is the Corpus Query Processor (CQP), an extremely powerful and efficient concordance system implementing a flexible two-level search language that allows complex query patterns to be specified both at the level of an individual word or annotation, and at the level of a fully- or partially-specified pattern of tokens. CWB and CQP are commonly used as the back-end for web-based corpus interfaces, for example, in the popular BNCweb interface to the British National Corpus (Hoffmann et al. 2008). CWB has influenced other tools, such as the Manatee software used in SketchEngine, which implements the same query language (Kilgarriff et al. 2004). This paper details recent work to update CWB for the new century. Perhaps the most significant development is that CWB version 3 is now an open source project, licensed under the GNU General Public Licence. This change has substantially <b>enlarged</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> of developers and users and has enabled us to leverage existing open-source libraries in extending CWB’s capabilities.

40|$|From the Introduction]. This paper forms {{part of a}} new {{research}} project into the origins of own resources. The serious lack of knowledge about this political process presents a major challenge to this study. The research therefore departs from an attempt to establish a narrative of the political process towards creating own resources. This narrative is based on completely new evidence from the historical archives of the Community institutions and member state administrations. Once we have a good overview of this, we can derive policy lessons and theoretical implications. This paper puts forward the first narrative linking the politics of financing the Community to the fate of the first attempt at <b>enlarging</b> <b>the</b> <b>Community</b> in 1961 - 63. The case study is based on new investigations into multiple historical archives at the national and European levels. For the further study of project about ‘sovereign states and supranational money - own resources, {{and the creation of a}} financial platform for the EU’ additional narrative will focus on: the Commission’s 1965 proposals for financing the Community, the empty chair crisis and resolution; the status of the financing proposals during the period of the second enlargement attempt; the relaunching of the financing debate in connection the plans for monetary union around the December 1969 Hague meeting; the final negotiations for the own resources agreement in April 1970...|$|R
