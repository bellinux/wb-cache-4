40|$|European Union {{supports}} alternative fuels, in particular, biofuels {{to comply}} with the triple objective of reducing greenhouse gases emissions, diversifying fuel supply and developing long-term replacements for fossil fuels. The European Community set the goal to substitute 20 % of the fossil fuels for road transport with alternative fuels by 2020 but the present market penetration of the biofuels is still very low. To support the market transition from conventional to alternative fuels, policies have been taken in the past and are defined at present, but many uncertainties remaining. It is crucial to provide an assessment of the effectiveness of policy measures and to investigate the appropriate policy recommendations to support market transition to alternative fuels. This paper surveys and discusses European Union energy markets and the instruments to promote biofuels, including policies, legislation and provision for possible <b>tax</b> <b>exemptions</b> <b>or</b> <b>reductions</b> for renewable energy sources.

40|$|Free trade zones (FTZs) {{date back}} to the time of the Phoenicians; they {{developed}} in the 1970 s and proliferated from 1980 until today. FTZs are duty-free areas where goods may be warehoused, processed, sold, serviced, distributed, showcased, packaged, labeled, sorted, assembled, and manufactured as finished goods, prior to re-exporting them as duty-exempt finished products. More than one 135 countries operate tax-free trade zones. There are more than 3, 500 of these zones and subzones all over the world, and 277 FTZs and 500 subzones exist in the United States, creating 68 million direct jobs and over 500 billion of direct trade-related value added within the zones. FTZs benefit both importers and exporters because both save on taxes, reduce transportation costs, avoid financing charges, and thereby increase their business cash flow. Exporters view FTZs as an entry into foreign markets, an opportunity to defer or avoid customs duties, and a way to obtain income <b>tax</b> <b>exemptions</b> <b>or</b> <b>reductions.</b> This article is a primer on the way FTZs work in the United States and abroad. It asks whether FTZs have {{had an impact on the}} U. S. economy. The article delves deeply into the business benefits and tax advantages of FTZs. U. S. exports from general purpose zones and subzones have generally increased from 1989 to 2008, earning the U. S. from 10 to 40 billion. Despite the plethora of bilateral trade agreements and the fall in U. S. tariff rates, which have increased the importation of foreign products into the U. S., the use of FTZs has grown significantly since 1970 and resulted in an increase in US exports. By using FTZs, the U. S. manufacturer can get around the 2 ̆ 2 inverted tariff rate 2 ̆ 2 which encourages the importation of foreign goods into the US. FTZs reduce costs for the American business and incentivize exportation of U. S. products. FTZs can play a significant role in economic growth by increasing exports, enhancing industry competitiveness, and attracting foreign direct investment. Special privileges are given to manufacturers who export the products processed in the FTZ. Export processing zones (EPZs) focus on manufacturing of exports only and allow investors to import and export goods free of duties and exchange controls, facilitate licensing and other regulatory processes, and liberate businesses from obligations to pay corporate taxes, value added taxes, or other local taxes. The purpose of FTZs is to attract foreign direct investment; alleviate unemployment, especially for women; foster economic reform strategies by developing and diversifying exports; and test new approaches to foreign direct investment and to government policies related to law, land, labor, and the pricing of goods. Some FTZs succeed (if they are focused on increasing exports) and some FTZs fail (if the industry simply takes advantage of the tax advantages without producing substantial employment or export earnings and without providing healthy labor and environmental conditions for the workers). FTZs have been criticized for bad labor practices, environmental abuses, the failure to increase exports sufficiently, and the liberal use of zones by money launderers and narcotics traffickers. Nevertheless, FTZs reduce the cost of manufacturing in America, reduce the massive trade deficit, and help create new jobs for American workers. There are conflicting reports on the advantages and disadvantages of FTZs and their impact on the U. S. economy. In order for FTZs to increase exports, facilitate constructive international trade, and enhance international business, rational and reasonable regulatory schemes must ensure that zones are being used for the primary purpose of increasing exports and safeguarding social and environmental standards both in the U. S. and abroad...|$|E

40|$|Forest-derived methane may {{contribute}} significantly to a vehicle fleet independent of fossil fuels by 2030. At present, there is sufficient technical knowledge about energy conversion methods and several Swedish actors have investigated and prepared investments in production facilities, but the technology is not commercially mature yet and it needs support during a development period. Investments in the technology have become less favorable because of the drop in the oil price in 2014. In addition, the predictability of the policy instruments supporting production and use of renewable energy are perceived as low by investors. This report emphasize that these factors combined are major reasons why potential investments are postponed. We have conducted a literature study and an interview study with three industry actors {{to answer the question}} “How can forest derived methane complement biogas from anaerobic digestion in the Swedish transport sector?” Interviews were mostly conducted in situ and in co-operation with the f 3 project “Examining systemic constraints and drivers for production of forest-derived transport biofuels” (f 3 2014 - 002370). The literature study included the recent development of renewable transport fuels in Sweden, existing and proposed policy instruments, and possible technical pathways from forest biomass to transport fuels. Sweden has accomplished a high share of renewables in the transport sector – 12 % based on energy content or 17 % when accounting in accordance with the EU Renewable Energy Sources Directive (RES). Thus, Sweden has the highest share of renewables in the transport sector among the member states and has with a good margin accomplished the EU-RES target of 10 % renewables by 2020. The use of electricity in plug-in electric vehicles is not included in these figures and the number of electric vehicles is increasing rapidly. The most common biofuels in transport are biodiesel, ethanol, and biogas. Biodiesel increases rapidly, mainly through low blend-in, and is now the most common biofuel in the Swedish transport sector. The majority is HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oils), but the share of FAME (Fatty Acid Methyl Esters) is still considerable. The use of ethanol peaked during 2008 and has been decreasing since then. Ethanol is distributed through both low and high blend-in (E 5 and E 85). The use of upgraded biogas in the transport sector has increased continuously since its introduction 1996. Upgraded biogas is complemented by natural gas to meet the vehicle gas demand. A voluntary agreement among the distributors maintains a minimum biogas share that corresponds to 50 %. The biogas share is much higher today (74 % by volume, average Jan. -Aug. 2015) and some large end-users use pure upgraded biogas. Upgraded biogas is mainly distributed in compressed form through gas cylinders (79 %), but also through injection to the natural gas grid (21 %). Very little biogas is distributed in liquid form (LBG). Studies of the practical production potential shows that the current vehicle gas demand could be met entirely with upgraded biogas. However, an increased demand will eventually require other production pathways based on other feedstocks. Gasification of forest biomass is one such pathway. One alternative is that an increased demand is met with natural gas, resulting in fossil lock-in effects. Another alternative is a stagnated vehicle gas market. Production of upgraded biogas and use in the transport sector have been promoted in different ways, e. g., demand on handling of waste that will promote anaerobic digestion, investment support to production facilities, support to distribution infrastructure, environmental car premiums, and exemptions of energy and CO 2 <b>taxes.</b> The <b>tax</b> <b>exemptions</b> are only granted until the end of 2015 but the Swedish government has applied for permission to the European Commission for a <b>tax</b> <b>exemption</b> until the end of 2020. A biofuel may only be compensated to a certain level to comply with rules set by the European Commission. If the renewable alternative is cheaper because of <b>tax</b> <b>exemptions</b> <b>or</b> <b>tax</b> <b>reductions</b> it is considered as overcompensation and illegal state aid and the compensation has to be adjusted. This has in Sweden occurred for FAME, E 5 and E 85, but since the cost for biogas is almost twice that of natural gas, it is not likely that the <b>tax</b> <b>exemptions</b> for biogas will be considered as illegal state aid.   Among the suggested policy instruments in the FFF inquiry are the price premium model and the quota obligation. The government prepared for a quota obligation but it was later withdrawn because the European Commission considered it as illegal state aid when combined with Sweden´s current CO 2 tax. These changes decrease the predictability for potential investors. The actors that we have interviewed propose different policy instruments to promote production of transport fuels from forest biomass: the price premium model, a quota obligation, or a system inspired by the tradable green certificate system. However, more important than the type of policy instrument is that the support is substantial and predictable during the pay back period of the investment. There is a large potential in forest biomass for transport fuel production in Sweden. Different pathways, which result in different transport fuels, compete not only for the feedstock and the end-users, but also for financing, research & development funds, and the policy makers’ attention. This study suggests that: In order to attract investments in forest-derived methane, the vehicle gas market must continue to increase.   Increased policy support directed at the demand may be needed. This is because the gasification technology is sensitive to economies of scale {{and the size of the}} facilities that have been considered are equivalent to the entire market for upgraded biogas. To invest in such a facility implies too large a risk given the size of the current demand and the uncertainties of the future market. If methane should be able to play an increasingly important role in a future transportation sector, the gasification technology need policy support during a development period. The predictability of policy support is perceived as low. The predictability is more important than the specific type of policy instrument to attract investments. The interviewees in this report suggest the following policy instruments for the support of forest-derived methane: the price premium model, a quota obligation, or a system inspired by the tradable green certificate system. The current low oil price decreases the likelihood for investments. Policy instruments that compensate for the oil price risk are needed, e. g. the price premium model. Swedish industry actors can realize the potential in forest biomass through production of transport fuels if beneficial conditions are given. Such a development does not only contribute to a vehicle fleet independent of fossil fuels but also to regional development. QC 20160229 </p...|$|R

We analyze the rationale of this two step process by pointing out the benefits of decentralizing redistributive decisions to the member states and the costs linked to reduced coordination (the use of structural funds, viewed as a complement to state aids, reduces some of these costs). We then point out that in a second best world objectives of redistribution are not incompatible with competition but that their relationship is less straightforward than with perfect markets; this has consequences for the rationale of having block exemptions, and for the effects of structural funds.
