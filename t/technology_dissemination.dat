The humanitarian response usually focuses on food availability and access, while food processing is often neglected. In this framework, cooking technologies play an essential role. Many scientific studies and international reports address the issue of clean cooking <b>technologies</b> <b>dissemination</b> in developing countries. Less information is instead available in the literature for the specific case of humanitarian contexts, such as refugee and Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps, or informal humanitarian settlements. Unsustainable and inefficient cooking technologies or practices can have direct impact on food preparation, and indirect effects on local biomass resources overexploitation, health of local people, and social conflicts between hosted and hosting communities. This study aims at presenting a systematic review of both scientific and grey literature on cooking technologies and related practices, including a selection of experiences from the implementation of cooking devices in humanitarian projects and programmes.

40|$|Introduction. Appropriate use {{of genetic}} tests for {{population-based}} cancer screening, diagnosis of inherited cancers, and guidance of cancer treatment can improve health outcomes. We investigated clinicians’ use {{and knowledge of}} eight breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer genetic tests. Methods. We conducted a randomized survey of 2, 191 Oregon providers, asking about their experience with fecal DNA, OncoVue, BRCA, MMR, CYP 2 D 6, tumor gene expression profiling, UGT 1 A 1, and KRAS. Results. Clinicians reported low confidence in their knowledge of medical genetics; most confident were OB-GYNs and specialists. Clinicians {{were more likely to}} have ordered/recommended BRCA and MMR than the other tests, and OB-GYNs were twice as likely to have ordered/recommended BRCA testing than primary care providers. Less than 10 % of providers ordered/recommended OncoVue, fecal DNA, CYP 2 D 6, or UGT 1 A 1; less than 30 % ordered/recommended tumor gene expression profiles or KRAS. The most common reason for not ordering/recommending these tests was lack of familiarity. Conclusions. Use of appropriate, evidence-based testing can help reduce incidence and mortality of certain cancers, but these tests need to be better integrated into clinical practice. Continued evaluation of emerging <b>technologies,</b> <b>dissemination</b> of findings, and an increase in provider confidence and knowledge are necessary to achieve this end...|$|R
40|$|Biogas {{technology}} {{has the potential}} to provide benefits to three priority areas in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) : energy supply, sanitation, and food security. Despite this, uptake of biogas systems has been slow and sporadic in the region. This review paper investigates what has prevented widespread <b>dissemination</b> of the <b>technology</b> in SSA by looking at the key barriers in the region, as well as identifying the main opportunities and the lessons that can be learned from successful biogas dissemination experiences in Rwanda, Tanzania, China, India, and Nepal. Installation costs, limited awareness and training for biogas users and insufficient follow-up services were recognised as being among the key barriers. SSA has favourable conditions for biogas technology, namely a suitable tropical climate {{in most parts of the}} region, a dominance of agricultural activities, and interest in alternatives to expensive conventional energy services. The region's favourable conditions therefore provide opportunities for increasing uptake of the technology. Experiences in other regions highlighted the importance of the government in supporting the biogas sector through suitable policies and incentives. Collaboration between research institutions, governmental departments, and biogas users, both current and future, was also recognised as being vital to improve the <b>technology's</b> <b>dissemination</b> and appropriate, long-term use...|$|R

By {{focusing on the}} role of various social networks in the rainwater harvesting adoption process, future studies will uncover {{a better understanding of the}} social factors and collective concerns influencing adoption rather than only reveal the individual cognitive perspectives for rainwater harvesting <b>technology</b> <b>dissemination.</b> Since this study is based on an extensive field survey, its empirical findings on social networks offer new directions and valuable insights to risk communication studies in other disaster risk contexts. Recent studies that only analyze disaster preparedness intention and behavior from an individual perspective fail to tell us how individuals are influenced by groups, social norms, and social learning that affect personal beliefs. The present study’s findings improve understanding of the adoption process by clarifying the types of actors individuals choose as their social referents in a disaster prevention <b>technology</b> <b>dissemination</b> setting. Research on the determinants of the adoption of disaster preventive measures should not be confined to collecting data on individual demographics and cognitive characteristics, but also include information on the respondents’ social networks.|$|E
