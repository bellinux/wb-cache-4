5|$|In 2002 Johnson {{received}} $1.1 {{million in}} grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education. Johnson used the money to create eight smaller learning communities for the 2003–2004 school year. In {{the first five years}} the graduation rate at Johnson increased 19% with state-required 10th grade reading and writing tests also seeing double digit increases. The money from the grants ran out before the 20062007 school year. Currently, there are eight smaller learning communities within the school. All students start in the Freshmen FOCUS Academy and then choose one of seven other academies for the remainder of their high school career based on their interests. Beginning with the class of 2006, graduating seniors are required to engage in the Senior Project, a program designed for students to showcase <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>they</b> have developed during their stay at Johnson and as a practice for building a résumé or portfolio when applying for jobs.|$|E

25|$|Christopher Jencks {{concludes that}} as a group African Americans have been harmed by the {{introduction}} of standardized entrance exams such as the SAT. This, according to him, is not because the tests themselves are flawed, but because of labeling bias and selection bias; the tests measure the skills that African Americans are less likely to develop in their socialization, rather than <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>they</b> are more likely to develop. Furthermore, standardized entrance exams are often labeled as tests of general ability, rather than of certain aspects of ability. Thus, a situation is produced in which African American ability is consistently underestimated within the education and workplace environments, contributing in turn to selection bias against them which exacerbates underachievement.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{circular}} migration {{has been described}} as a triple-win scenario, providing benefits for the host country, the home country, and the migrants themselves. Developed countries allow migrants to enter in order to fill labor shortages, but with the understanding that the settlement is not permanent, distinguishing it from immigration. Developing countries benefit in the sense that they are not truly losing their skilled migrants, as these workers will return after a period of time to continue working. The migrants themselves benefit through <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>they</b> learn abroad, as well as their increase in wages. The form of benefits in this triple-win discourse often take three forms: financial capital, human capital, and social capital. Circularity is the most beneficial whenever migrants move voluntary between locations in the pursuit of different interests, as well as when migrants have positive experiences while abroad, including financial and educational success.|$|E

[...] Bartik, who became the co-lead programmer (with Betty Holberton), and the other four original programmers became extremely adept at running the ENIAC; with no manual to rely on, the group reviewed diagrams of the device, interviewed the engineers who had built it, and used this information to teach themselves <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>they</b> needed. Initially, they were not allowed to see the ENIAC's hardware at all since it was still classified and they had not received security clearance; they had to learn how to program the machine solely through studying schematic diagrams.

2500|$|Due {{to limited}} opportunities, between 1880–1910 there was {{extensive}} emigration, and around 300,000 Slovenes (i.e. 1 in 6) emigrated to other countries, {{mostly to the}} US, but also to South America (main part to Argentina), Germany, Egypt, and to larger cities in Austria-Hungary, especially [...] Vienna and Graz. The area of the United States with the highest concentration of Slovenian immigrants is Cleveland, Ohio.

2500|$|In 2006, FIG {{introduced}} a new points system for Artistic gymnastics in which scores are no longer limited to 10 points. The system {{is used in the}} US for elite level competition. Unlike the old code of points, there are two separate scores, an execution score and a difficulty score. In the previous system, the [...] "execution score" [...] was the only score. It was and still is out of 10.00, except for short exercises. During the gymnast's performance, the judges deduct this score only. A fall, on or off the event, is a 1.00 deduction, in elite level gymnastics. The introduction of the difficulty score is a significant change. The gymnast's difficulty score is based on what elements they perform and is subject to change if they do not perform or complete all the skills, or they do not connect a skill meant to be connected to another. Connection bonuses are where deviation happens most common between the intended and actual difficulty scores, as {{it can be difficult to}} connect multiple flight elements. It is very hard to connect skills if the first skill is not performed correctly. The new code of points allows the gymnasts to gain higher scores based on the difficulty of <b>the</b> <b>skills</b> <b>they</b> perform as well as their execution. There is no maximum score for difficulty, as it can keep increasing as the difficulty of the skills increase.|$|E
