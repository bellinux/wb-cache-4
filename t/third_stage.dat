5|$|About 257 seconds {{into the}} flight, {{the second stage}} cut off, and the rocket entered a coast phase to apogee. Immediately after cut-off, the second stage {{attitude}} control system was pressurised. During the coast the correct orientation for <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> separation was maintained {{by means of the}} attitude control system. Towards the end of the coast period, the <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> was spun up to a rate of 3hertz (180rpm) by means of six Imp rockets. Five seconds later, the <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> separated, and following ten more seconds of coasting, it ignited. The <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> was a Waxwing solid rocket motor, which burned for 55 seconds.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>third</b> <b>stage,</b> Pottier had {{to abandon}} due to tendinitis. The lead was back with Trousselier, who {{also won the}} stage.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to modern stage races, a cyclist {{who gave up}} during a stage was allowed to start again the next stage, although {{he would no longer}} be in contention for the general classification. Thus Hippolyte Aucouturier, who gave up during the first stage, was able to return, and won the second and third stages. Charles Laeser, winner of the fourth stage, had not completed the <b>third</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the <b>third</b> <b>stage,</b> four cyclists (Julien Gabory, Henri Gauban, Gaston Tuvache and Maurice Carrere) were disqualified {{for taking}} the train. The Ballon d'Alsace, which {{had been the first}} real {{mountain}} in the Tour de France the previous year, was featured again. Just as the year before, it was mounted first by Pottier. The stage was also won by Pottier, more than 45 minutes ahead of the rest.|$|E
5|$|The event {{began with}} a long {{primarily}} flat stage that was won by Dario Beni. He lost the lead after the next stage to the eventual winner Luigi Ganna, who in turn lost it to Carlo Galetti after the mountainous <b>third</b> <b>stage.</b> Ganna regained the lead after the fourth stage and successfully defended {{it all the way}} to the finish in Milan, winning three stages en route. Atala won the team classification.|$|E

Three deposition a! sequences -Figols 1, 2 and 3 - are recorded and are organized in <b>third</b> order <b>stages</b> of growth. All the sequences have similar features in the first stage. Lower boundaries are tectonically induced. A sudden zonal basinward shifting occurs and depositional systems (lobes) are developed. Second and <b>third</b> <b>stages</b> are well developed in Figols 2 and 3. The second stages record a strong and progressive landward shifting in both systems and the <b>third</b> <b>stages</b> are the basinat expression of the foreland carbonate ramp...|$|R

5|$|The mildest form of hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{is difficult to}} detect clinically, but may be demonstrated on neuropsychological testing. It is experienced as forgetfulness, mild confusion, and irritability. The first stage of {{hepatic encephalopathy}} is characterised by an inverted sleep-wake pattern (sleeping by day, being awake at night). The second stage is marked by lethargy and personality changes. The <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> is marked by worsened confusion. The fourth stage {{is marked by a}} progression to coma.|$|E
5|$|The route was {{primarily}} flat, {{although it did}} contain a few major ascents. The <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> contained ascents to Macerone, Rionero Sannitico, and Roccaraso. The Giro's sixth stage contained only one pass, the Passo Bracco. The seventh stage {{was the last to}} contain any major ascents: the climbs of the Colle di Nava and the ascent to San Bartolomeo.|$|E
5|$|The <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> is the {{transfer}} of memory and personality from the original person to the mature clone. For the process to maintain one branch for personality and memory, as opposed to two, a recording of the individual's mind would be required before the time of death, and would be transferred to an adult clone body after the original has died.|$|E

50|$|The launch {{proceeded}} {{according to}} plan until T+288.6 seconds {{at an altitude of}} 145 km, when the second and <b>third</b> <b>stages</b> of the booster began separation. Only three of the six locks holding the stages together released and the <b>third</b> <b>stage's</b> engine ignited with the second stage still attached below it. The <b>third</b> <b>stage's</b> thrust broke the remaining locks, throwing the second stage free but putting the booster under unexpected strain that caused it to deviate from the proper trajectory. At T+295 seconds, the deviation was detected by the Soyuz's guidance system, which activated an automatic abort program. As the escape tower was long gone by this point, the abort had to be performed with the Soyuz's own engines. This separated the spacecraft from the third-stage booster and then separated the orbital and service modules of the Soyuz from the re-entry capsule.|$|R

5|$|Three stages may be distinguished: {{an initial}} stage {{in which the}} {{individual}} with PD has already developed some disability requiring pharmacological treatment, a second stage associated with the development of complications related to levodopa usage, and a <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> when symptoms unrelated to dopamine deficiency or levodopa treatment may predominate.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> of General Sir Herbert Plumer's Passchendaele offensive, {{an attack}} against Broodseinde was {{scheduled}} for 4 October 1917. The 3rd Australian Division's 10th Australian Infantry Brigade {{was one of the}} assault formations charged with delivering the main blow, and ultimately with seizing the heavily defended Broodseinde Ridge. To provide defence against low-flying German aircraft during the attack, a group of 24 men, including Peeler, from the 3rd Pioneer Battalion's machine gun section were attached to the 10th Brigade's 37th Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impacts {{state of}} health was {{uncertain}} during the first day after launch. Shortly after entering orbit around the Sun and deploying its solar panels, the probe switched itself to safe mode. The {{cause of the problem}} was simply an incorrect temperature limit in the fault protection logic for the spacecraft's RCS thruster catalyst beds. The spacecraft's thrusters were used to detumble the spacecraft following <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> separation. On January 13, 2005, NASA announced that the probe was out of safe mode and healthy.|$|E

50|$|The N1-L3 {{used only}} kerosene-based rocket fuel {{in all three}} of its stages, while the Saturn V used liquid {{hydrogen}} to fuel its second and <b>third</b> <b>stages,</b> which yielded an overall performance advantage due to the higher specific impulse. The N1 also wasted available propellant volume by using spherical propellant tanks under its conical-shaped external skin, while the Saturn V used most of its available cylindrical skin volume to house capsule-shaped hydrogen and oxygen tanks, with common bulkheads between the tanks {{in the second and}} <b>third</b> <b>stages.</b>|$|R

5|$|In August 2007, {{the stadium}} was {{planned to be}} built in three stages, with a {{combined}} budget of NOK156.6 million. The first stage would involve the northern and western sides and cost NOK78.4 million, the second stage would involve the eastern side and cost NOK43.0 million, while the <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> would involve the southern side and cost NOK35.1 million. After construction started, BG changed two specifications, moving public rest rooms from the basement to the ground floor, and changing the angle of roof. Both of these gave increased construction costs and alteration of the architectural design plans.|$|E

5|$|In the Vedic-era literature, {{only three}} ashramas (life stages) were mentioned, with Brahmacharya (student) {{as the first}} stage and the Grihastha (householder) as the second stage. The <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> of life, in the Vedic texts, {{combined}} Vanaprastha (retired or forest dweller) and Sannyasa (renunciation) as one ashrama. According to Soti Shivendra Chandra, a scholar at the Rohilkhand University, the separation of Vanaprastha and Sannyasa as two different stages of life is first mentioned in the Jabala Upanishad. However, Patrick Olivelle, {{a professor at the}} University of Texas at Austin, states that the Sannyasa ashrama as a separate stage is mentioned in Aruni Upanishad, which likely is a more ancient Upanishad.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} stage, Aucouturier {{had a clear}} lead and seemed set to win a third {{successive}} stage, but was caught using the slipstream of a car, and {{was removed from the}} race. Swiss Charles Laeser (who had abandoned in the 3rd stage) took the victory, becoming the first non-French winner. As in the <b>third</b> <b>stage,</b> the cyclists departed in two groups, and Laeser was in the second group because he was no longer contending for the general classification. Laeser finished more than 50 minutes after a group of six cyclists, but he had travelled the distance 4 minutes faster than them, so he was declared the winner.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} stage {{the aim is to}} reduce PD {{symptoms}} while controlling fluctuations in the effect of the medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed. When oral medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery, deep brain stimulation, subcutaneous waking day apomorphine infusion and enteral dopa pumps can be of use. The <b>third</b> <b>stage</b> presents many challenging problems requiring a variety of treatments for psychiatric symptoms, orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction, etc. In the final stages of the disease, palliative care is provided to improve quality of life.|$|E
