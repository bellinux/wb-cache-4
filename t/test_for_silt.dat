The soils {{used in this study}} were sand, wet sand, and silt. The soils in the prepared soil beds were first characterized as to strength, density, and plasticity. Then pressure sensors were embedded at depths of 2 and 5 in. These were then traversed several times by a Mine Detonation Trailer (MDT) and the pressure produced by a single chosen wheel re-corded. The actual measured load of this wheel was 4700 pounds. The same series of measurements were made using the CRREL Instrumented Vehicle (CIV) with a measured wheel load of about 1500 pounds. The results were compared with the expected values calculated using the Froehlich modification of the Boussinesq equation.

40|$|In {{dredging}} works, fines are {{encountered in}} different ways. Fines {{can be produced}} during the cutting of rocks or {{can be found in}} natural deposited sand. The presence of fines in sand soil is generally recognized as problem in geotechnical engineering. It is believed that fines in a sand increases soil compressibility and tendency to creep. Also it is often assumed that the strength, stiffness, hydraulic conductivity and liquefaction potential of a soil increases with increasing fines content. Therefore, during tender phase of reclamation works, it is always recommended that the soil should contain minimum amount of fines 10 % of fines. It has been recognized that the availability of soils which have small amount of 10 % of fines is very rare. In most of projects soil with maximum amount of fines above 10 % are encountered. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the mechanical behavior of sand soil with different amount of fines. The main interest is on the compressibility of sandy soils. The compressibility of sandy soil is investigated and their results are shown. A series of oedometer <b>test</b> <b>for</b> saturated <b>silt</b> sand mixtures is presented. During testing the following material were used River Maas sand and crushed sand, artificial silt (crushed quartz) and Belgium silt. The mixture were created by mixing River Maas sand and crushed sand with either artificial silt or Belgium silt as percentage of dry mass. Sand silt mixtures with fines contents of 7 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %, 30 %, and 50 %. The samples were prepared in different initial relative densities using slurry deposition methods. In oedometer the mixtures were loaded in interval of 3. 5, 6. 9, 13. 9, 34. 6, 69. 8, 138. 5, 277. 1, 554. 2 and 1108. 3 kPa. Result shows that, the coefficient of consolidation of sand silt mixture increases with fines content from 7 % and reaches the peak value at 15 % then the coefficient of consolidation decreases with increase of fines contents. The compression index of silt sand mixtures decreases with increase on fines contents from 7 % to 30 % and then increases with increase of fines contents. The value of compression index for fines contents of 15 to 30 % is low due to its highest packing density. The secondary compression on artificial silt sand mixture is very low it is between 0. 001 - 0. 004 but <b>for</b> Belgium <b>silt</b> sand the secondary compression is significantly higher. The difference in secondary compression is due to their difference in mineralogical composition and grain size and shape. It can be conclude that the presence of fines on sand does not increase the compression and secondary compression of the sand but it is improving it. Therefore for mixtures with fines content above 10 % between 15 to 35 % are useful for reclamation activities because of their low primary compression and low secondary compression.

The time series of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) for a grain size in the sand range (63 to 500 m) had strong correlations with those for other sand grain sizes, and the strong correlations were also observed in the silt range (2. 5 to 28 m). However, at zero time lag, the time series of SSC for sand grain sizes had little correlations with those <b>for</b> <b>silt</b> sizes.

The concentrations of permanganate decreased rapidly during the first 8 d of the reaction process. The reaction follows first order kinetics, with rate constant ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 3 /h. The total oxidant demand (TOD) is significantly higher <b>for</b> clayey <b>silt</b> fill than <b>for</b> soils of other lithology. The typical TOD is about 50 g MnO(4) (-) /kg soil <b>for</b> clayey <b>silt</b> fill, 20 - 40 g MnO(4) (-) /kg soil <b>for</b> <b>silt,</b> silty clay and 1 - 7 g MnO(4) (-) /kg soil for fine sand. Statistical analysis revealed that TOD {{was positively correlated with}} total organic carbon (TOC) content, clay content and PAHs concentrations, besides sand content, meanwhile TOC was the parameter with the strongest influence on oxidant demand. After 32 d duration of oxidation, PAHs in all tested soils were effectively removed, with total removal percent ranging from 78 % to 99 %, and small molecular weight PAHs were removed {{to a greater extent than}} high molecular weight PAHs. Parameters obtained in this study, combined with soil bulk density, soil porosity and soil moisture, can be used for full-scale ISCO system design and application in coking contaminated site.
