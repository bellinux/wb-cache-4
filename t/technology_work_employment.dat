40|$|Waves of ‘new technology’ have {{typically}} {{been accompanied by}} widespread speculation regarding their economic and social impacts. Most notably, in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s, computerisation and the microchip prompted cataclysmic predictions regarding their effects for employment. For example, the World Centre for Computer Sciences and Human Resources estimated that, {{by the end of}} the 1980 s, as many as 50 million people would be displaced by new information and communication technologies (ICTs) (Braham, 1985, cited in Boreham et[*]al., 2007 : 3). In the aftermath of speculation on the ‘Information Revolution’, whether dystopian (Jenkins and Sherman, 1979) or utopian (Toffler, 1970), New <b>Technology,</b> <b>Work</b> and <b>Employment</b> was established as corrective and as a forum for theoretically informed, empirically grounded research on the impact of technological developments on <b>work,</b> <b>employment</b> and workplace social relations. In place of grand theorising, then, the journal set itself the more prosaic but robust social scientific objective of describing, mapping and analysing emerging realities...|$|R

New <b>Technology,</b> <b>Work</b> and <b>Employment</b> published by John Wiley & Sons LtdThis paper draws upon the findings of qualitative interviews carried out with teleworkers, their office-based colleagues and supervisory staff of a teleworking initiative introduced by a UK public sector local authority to explore workplace social support relationships. Our study found differences between office-based and permanent teleworking staff {{in terms of social}} support. For teleworkers relationships at work are complex, with social support networks being established prior to working at home. By working from home, teleworkers were able to develop greater social support relationships with some colleagues, predominantly other teleworkers, {{while at the same time}} allowing them to distance themselves from negative work relationships. Overall, a social disconnection developed between teleworkers and office-based staff. In contrast social support was more important for office-based workers, who valued co-worker relationships with other office-based staff...|$|R
40|$|Editorial first paragraph: Why {{this special}} issue? As New <b>Technology,</b> <b>Work</b> and <b>Employment</b> (NTWE) celebrates its silver jubilee, {{this special issue}} aims to honour the longstanding imperatives of the journal by {{providing}} an opportunity to Make Space for critical accounts of NTWE. It is our intention that this space may be offered to approaches that have their roots in other traditions or adopt slightly different sensibilities to those that are typically found in NTWE. However, before we introduce our attempt at making such space, we want to recognise the importance and value {{of the work of}} NTWE. In the first instance, credit must go to the late Brian Towers, the founder and chairman of the Editorial Committee of the journal. Brian was also an academic with the foresight and energy to recognise that themes laid down in Gill's 1985 seminal study of Work, Unemployment and the New Technology should form the basis of a coherent academic research programme with an associated journal. As Baldry (2011) has recently observed in his NTWE Editorial Chronicling the IT Revolution, in the mid- 1980 s, the demand for a coherent body of academic research was a direct response to emerging discourses of the time, many of which appeared rhetorically rich, optimistic and long on hope whilst light on analysis. Indeed, to have a journal that was dedicated to critical studies of the implications and impact of new <b>technologies</b> on <b>work</b> experiences and <b>employment</b> was both radical and necessary given a period typified by talk of new revolutions (Bell, 1974; Stonier, 1982) and the future of work (Jones, 1982; Handy, 1984). With a distinctive empirical focus, NTWE demonstrated that the introduction and implementations of new technologies in workplaces were (and remain) contested terrains. Indeed, the empirical character of NTWE remains a major contribution in organisational studies and as Baldry also noted, developments in NTWE have taken quite specific trajectories in terms of sectors considered, occupational identities scrutinised and ‘new’ managerial practices introduced to reconfigure control of work. The political sensibility for critiquing managerial rationality remains strong...|$|R

Available at [URL] This thesis deals with socio-technical approaches {{to the work of}} implementing ICT systems in health care. In the thesis, I address and reflect on challenges related to design and implementation as well as integration of ICT systems with hospital laboratories. Based upon empirical examples gathered from a longitudinal case study using interpretive methods, the results suggest how health care practices can shape the implementation of integrated systems and what role users may have in these projects. The thesis concerns not only the practical challenges of integration, but also how large-scale integration challenges may be handled. In recent decades, several projects and national strategies aimed at enabling electronic interactions within the health care system have failed. Despite heavy investment of resources, the results of many projects are still far from the initial goals. Major delays and budget overruns are common. One important reason for such outcomes is that designers and project managers do not manage to grasp the complexities in the existing practices when they draw up strategies for more efficient health care. My objective is to spell out this complexity in detail. By reflecting on previous research, I emphasize that ICT systems, when designed, do not adequately address existing practices and existing portfolios in health care organizations. In the light of the diversity and variations across different health care practices, a broader approach and understanding is necessary to understand the impact of these differences. In this thesis, integration is seen from a broader socio-technical perspective, which offers an important foundation for increased cooperation between designers of ICT systems and members of organizations. I illustrate the importance of such cooperation by showing that users may be an unexploited resource in large-scale ICT projects. In some cases, users should be regarded as co-designers of ICT systems...|$|R
