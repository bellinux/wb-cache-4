After becoming a journalist, image reporter and chief editor, France 2 gave her the opportunity to present entertainment programs. She joined the channel to host with Olivier Minne special evening shows such as La Saint Valentin en chansons. She then presented during summer 2007 the program Les Rois du Rire, broadcast on Saturday {{in the second part of}} the evening. The program was then broadcast on some Saturdays in the late afternoon, in the evening of New Year's Eve, or more exceptionally, as a tribute to deceased humorists. She continued in the meantime to present special programs in prime, often with Olivier Minne, including <b>Tubes</b> <b>des</b> <b>Tubes</b> in July 2007, Les stars de l'année 2007 in December 2007, and even Les Femmes en chansons in April 2008.|$|R

2500|$|At {{this time}} the American Telephone and Telegraph Company was researching ways to amplify {{telephone}} signals to provide better long-distance service, and it was recognized that de Forest's device had potential as a telephone line repeater. In mid-1912 an associate, John Stone Stone, contacted AT to arrange for de Forest to demonstrate his invention. It was found that de Forest's [...] "gassy" [...] version of the Audion could not handle even the relatively low voltages used by telephone lines. (Due {{to the way he}} constructed the <b>tubes,</b> <b>de</b> Forest's Audions would cease to operate with too high a vacuum.) However, careful research by Dr. Harold D. Arnold and his team at AT's Western Electric subsidiary determined that by improving the tube's design, it could be more fully evacuated, and the high vacuum allowed it to successfully operate at telephone line voltages. With these changes the Audion evolved into a modern electron-discharge vacuum tube, using electron flows rather than ions. (Dr. Irving Langmuir at the General Electric Corporation made similar findings, and both he and Arnold attempted to patent the [...] "high vacuum" [...] construction, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1931 that this modification could not be patented).|$|R
2500|$|The grid Audion was {{the first}} device to amplify, albeit only slightly, the {{strength}} of received radio signals. However, to many observers it appeared that de Forest had done nothing more than add the grid electrode to an existing detector configuration, the Fleming valve, which also consisted of a filament and plate enclosed in an evacuated glass <b>tube.</b> <b>De</b> Forest passionately denied the similarly of the two devices, claiming his invention was a relay that amplified currents, while the Fleming valve was merely a rectifier that converted alternating current to direct current. (For this reason, de Forest objected to his Audion being referred to as [...] "a valve".) The U.S. courts were not convinced, and ruled that the grid Audion did in fact infringe on the Fleming valve patent, now held by Marconi. On the other hand, Marconi admitted that {{the addition of the}} third electrode was a patentable improvement, and the two sides agreed to license each other so that both could manufacture three-electrode tubes in the United States.

50|$|Souillac {{is located}} at the southernmost part of island.

The main road snakes through the village from its north east to its west, from the Bain des Naigresses bridge to the Souillac/Surinam bridge. Although there is no official apportionment of the village, the local people often distinguish the parts of the village as follows: quartiers of Terracine, Combo, Brise <b>de</b> mére, L'église, <b>Pitot,</b> Cité Gris-gris, Morcerllement Gris-gris, EDC and L'hopital.|$|R

[16] I took then a small Glass-pipe AB, {{about the}} bigness of a Swans quill, and about four foot long, {{which was very}} equally drawn, so that, as far as I could perceive, no one part was bigger then another: This Tube (being open at both ends) I fitted into another small <b>Tube</b> <b>DE,</b> that had a small bore just big enough to contain the small Pipe, and this was seal'd up at one, and open at the other, end; about which open end I fastned a small wooden box C with cement, so that filling the bigger Tube, {{and part of the}} box, with Quicksilver, I could thrust the smaller Tube into it, till it were all covered with the Quicksilver: Having thus done, I fastned my bigger Tube against the side of a wall, that it might stand the steadier, and {{plunging}} the small Tube cleer under the Mercury in the box, I stopt the upper end of it very fast with cement, then lifting up the small Tube, I drew it up by a small pully, and a string that I had fastned {{to the top of the}} Room, and found the height of the Mercurial Cylinder to be about twenty nine inches.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{vacuum tube}} used in radio was the {{thermionic}} diode or Fleming valve, invented by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904 as a detector for radio receivers. It was an evacuated glass bulb containing two electrodes, a heated filament {{and a plate}} (anode). Triodes came about in 1906 when American engineer Lee De Forest and Austrian physicist Robert von Lieben independently patented tubes that added a third electrode, a grid between the filament and plate to control current. von Lieben's partially-evacuated three-element tube, patented in March 1906, contained a trace of mercury vapor and was intended to amplify weak telephone signals. Starting in October 1906 De Forest patented a number of three-element tube designs by adding an electrode to the diode, which he called Audions, intended {{to be used as}} radio detectors. The one which became the design of the triode, in which the grid was located between the filament and plate, was patented January 29, 1907. Like the von Lieben vacuum <b>tube,</b> <b>De</b> Forest's Audions were incompletely evacuated and contained some gas at low pressure. [...] von Lieben's vacuum tube did not see much development due to his death 7 years after he invented it at the outbreak of World War I.|$|R

After Pitot refused a request to surrender, the two began to exchange broadsides, with Vengeance aiming high to damage Constellations rigging. Constellation eluded Pitot's attempts to board her, around 9:00 and again around 11:00.|$|R
