50|$|After {{the company}} was sold through the {{bankruptcy}} court on May 4, 1897, a new company known as the Colorado Midland Railway took over operation of the railroad. It then came under the joint control of the Colorado and Southern Railway and the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad in 1900. It again declared bankruptcy April 21, 1917, and was sold at auction to Albert E. Carlton of Colorado Springs. Carlton attempted to revive the railroad's fortunes, but his stewardship of the road coincided with the entry of the United States into the First World War. After the inauguration of the United States Railroad Administration in late 1917, the government managers redirected much of the trans-Colorado traffic that was previously carried by other railroads onto the Midland, which was ill-equipped {{to deal with the}} sudden upturn in business. The traffic overwhelmed the railroad, and when it became apparent that the Midland was incapable of dealing with the volume of business, the government redirected all of it elsewhere. Business dropped off precipitately, and Carleton was forced to apply for permission to abandon operations. He received it, and the Colorado Midland Railway ceased operations in 1918. Segments of the railroad were then sold to the Midland Terminal Railway; the rest of the line, mostly west of the Midland <b>Terminal</b> <b>connection</b> at Divide, was abandoned. The line was scrapped in the early 1920s.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{ground fault}} {{protection}} schemes can be applied for any generator <b>terminal</b> <b>connection</b> but it covers at most 95 % of generator stator length. 100 % protection for synchronous generator stator winding {{can be achieved by}} a combination of zero sequence and third harmonic protection schemes. The implementation of the third harmonic scheme on any generator is determined by magnitude of third harmonic voltage produced in the generator. The methods of connecting the generator terminal also influence the range of third harmonic voltage at the stator terminal and neutral. An investigation into the compatibility of particular generator configuration with the third harmonic scheme is important to prevent protection mal-operation since the scheme is hampered in performance by certain factors which include grounding method employed and generator <b>terminal</b> <b>connection</b> among others. In this paper, the modelling of parallel unit-connected generators of the second order is presented to study the influence of parallel unit-connected generators on third harmonic stator {{ground fault protection}}. Application of mesh analysis method to the circuit models produced ordinary non-linear algebraic equations. The equations were solved using Cramer’s rule. Simulations of the circuit models were performed for no-load, light load and full load conditions using MATLAB/SIMULINK to study the character of third harmonic voltage at stator neutral and terminal when a ground fault occurs to validate the results of the models. Introduction of a ground fault at the neutral point of the single generator showed that th...|$|E
