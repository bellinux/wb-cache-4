Blair was working {{to establish a new}} college for educating Anglican ministers, and he believed that Andros was not supportive of the idea. However, Blair and Nicholson worked closely <b>together</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> idea, with Nicholson often coming from Maryland for meetings on the subject.
