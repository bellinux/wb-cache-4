5|$|Denning made {{sweeping}} {{changes to the}} Common Law, with the resurrection of equitable estoppel and his reform of divorce law. A common misconception is <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> judgments were overturned in the House of Lords; many were, including the expansion to the doctrine of fundamental breach he set out in Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd, but they let many judgments stand and on occasion agreed with his judgment in situations where he dissented, such as in his final case George Mitchell (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Harper was {{the only}} Reform MP to support the {{creation}} of the Canadian Firearms Registry at second reading in 1995, although he later voted against it at third reading stage. He said {{at the time that he}} initially voted for the registry because of a poll showing <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> constituents supported it, and added that he changed his vote when a second poll showed the opposite result. It was reported in April 1995, that some Progressive Conservatives opposed to Jean Charest's leadership wanted to remove both Charest and Manning, and unite the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties under Harper's leadership.|$|E
5|$|Other Marxists, such as George Derwent Thomson and Neil Faulkner, {{have argued}} that Childe's archaeological work should not {{correctly}} be considered Marxist because he failed {{to take into account}} the existence of class struggle as an instrument of social change, something which was a core tenet of Marxist thought. While class struggle was not a factor he considered in his archaeological work, Childe did accept that historians and archaeologists typically interpreted the past through their own class interests, and <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> contemporaries were producing studies with an innate bourgeois agenda. Childe also diverged from orthodox Marxism by not employing dialectics in his methodology. Furthermore, he denied Marxism's ability to predict the future development of human society, and did not consider humanity's development into pure communism to be inevitable, instead opining that society could fossilize or become extinct instead.|$|E

5|$|Dinwiddie sent Washington {{back to the}} Ohio Country to {{safeguard}} an Ohio Company's construction of a fort at present-day Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Before he reached the area, a French force drove out colonial traders and began construction of Fort Duquesne. A small detachment of French troops led by Joseph Coulon de Jumonville was discovered by Tanacharison and a few warriors east of present-day Uniontown, Pennsylvania. On May 28, 1754, Washington {{and some of his}} militia unit, aided by their Mingo allies, ambushed the French in {{what has come to be}} called the Battle of Jumonville Glen. Exactly what happened during and after the battle is a matter of contention, but several primary accounts agree that the battle lasted about 15 minutes, that Jumonville was killed, and <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> party were either killed or taken prisoner. It is not completely clear whether Jumonville died at the hands of Tanacharison in cold blood, or was somehow shot by an onlooker with a musket as he sat with Washington, or by another means. Following the battle, Washington was given the epithet Town Destroyer by Tanacharison.|$|E
5|$|The QF 25-pounder Short {{received}} a mixed reception from gunners, and was particularly unpopular {{among members of}} AIF artillery units which had used the standard 25-pounder during the fighting in the Middle East. Guns were sometimes put out of action by damage caused by the absorption of violent recoil. The gun also {{had a tendency to}} tilt at low elevation; this was remedied by its crew standing on the trails, an expedient that had previously been used with the QF 4.5 inch Howitzer. Other limitations included a low rate of fire (three or four rounds per minute) and difficulties towing the weapon. Concerns were also raised over the quality of workmanship, and the commander of the 2/4th Field Regiment rejected a batch of Short 25-pounders sent to his unit before the Nadzab operation in the belief that they had been poorly manufactured. Inspectors subsequently concluded <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> criticisms were unfounded, however. The most important deficiency compared to the regular 25-pounder was the shorter range. As a result of its experience with the gun, the 9th Division recommended that they be pooled and reserved for their special role rather than be employed in a day-to-day role alongside the regular 25 pounder.|$|E

In 1751 {{his health}} failed; leaving his {{congregation}} and academy {{in charge of}} Richard Simpson, he went to Hexham, Northumberland, to stay with his eldest son, a physician. He died at Hexham on 8 June 1752, and {{was buried in the}} south aisle of the abbey church, where was a mural monument to his memory.|$|R
25|$|This {{represented}} a significant shift from Buffett's previous statements, {{to the effect}} <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fortune would pass to his Buffett Foundation.

25|$|Captured {{with his}} wife and twenty boxes of art in Aschbach (Schlüsselfeld) in June 1945, Gurlitt claimed that the art was part of his {{personal}} collection, and <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> collection and all of his records had been destroyed during the bombing of Dresden in February 1945. He painted himself as a victim of Nazi persecution due to his Jewish heritage, and on those grounds he was released.|$|E
50|$|Today, Cogan's {{reputation}} {{rests on}} his keyboard music, which compares well with <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> better-known contemporaries. His music {{falls into the}} period of the development from the harpsichord to the piano, and, in time, his compositions fully exploit the sonic and technical possibilities of the grand piano. His best music can be found among his piano sonatas and the piano concerto op. 5 (1790).|$|R

25|$|A notable {{characteristic}} of Linebarger's science fiction is <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> stories {{are set in}} the same fictional universe, with a unified chronology.

25|$|The Japanese {{also made}} {{major changes in}} their command. The most {{important}} was the replacement of General Kawabe at Burma Area Army by Hyotaro Kimura. Kimura threw Allied plans into confusion by refusing to fight at the Chindwin River. Recognising <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> formations were weak and short of equipment, he withdrew his forces behind the Irrawaddy River, forcing the Allies to greatly extend their lines of communication.|$|E

25|$|Sukanta Bhattacharya(15 August 1926 – 13 May 1947) was a Bengali {{poet and}} playwright. Along with Rabindranath Tagore and Kazi Nazrul Islam, {{he was one}} of the key figures of modern Bengali poetry, despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> works had been in {{publication}} posthumously. During his life, his poems were not widely circulated, but after his death his reputation grew to the extent that he became one of the most popular Bengali poet of the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|His detractors have {{focussed}} {{upon his}} statements in Shiva's Rainbow of how science {{in public policy}} is mostly theatre {{and how he was}} more of an actor than a scientist. Taylor admits freely <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> work was as a lawyer - 'the ultimate actor', but argues that his record as a skilled and experienced policy analyst has been glossed over by those who are averse to his message on climate change.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his black and white night shots, Link also recorded the single daytime train on the Norfolk & Western's hilly Abingdon branch, serving the rural communities from Abingdon, Virginia, 55 miles (88km) south to West Jefferson, North Carolina. It was also on this line <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> railroad color photography was done; a selection is included in The Last Steam Railroad in America. His familiar 1956 view of a horse and steam locomotive Maud bows to the Virginia Creeper (Green Cove, Virginia) exists {{in black and white}} and color versions.|$|E
50|$|Cadman’s musical education, unlike <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> American contemporaries, was {{completely}} American. Born in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, he began piano lessons at 13. Eventually, {{he went to}} nearby Pittsburgh where he studied harmony, theory, and orchestration with Luigi von Kunits and Emil Paur, then concertmaster and conductor, respectively, of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. This was the sum <b>of</b> <b>his</b> training. He was named a national honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity in 1915.|$|R

25|$|Whereas the devotional {{importance}} of relics and the economics associated with pilgrimages caused {{the remains of}} most saints to be divided up and spread over numerous churches in several countries, Saint Nicholas is unusual in <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bones have been preserved in one spot: his grave crypt in Bari. Even with the allegedly continuing miracle of the manna, the archdiocese of Bari has allowed for one scientific survey of the bones. In the late 1950s, during a restoration of the chapel, it allowed a team of hand-picked scientists to photograph and measure {{the contents of the}} crypt grave.|$|E
25|$|By 1966, more of de Hory's {{paintings}} were being revealed as forgeries; {{one man in}} particular, Texas oil magnate Algur H. Meadows, to whom Legros had sold 56 forged paintings, was so outraged to learn <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> collection was forged, that he demanded the arrest and prosecution of Legros. Angered, Legros decided {{to hide from the}} police at de Hory's house on Ibiza, where he asserted ownership, and threatened to evict de Hory. Coupled with this and with Legros' increasingly violent mood swings, de Hory decided to leave Ibiza. Legros and Lessard were apprehended soon thereafter, imprisoned on charges of check fraud.|$|E
25|$|Primarily {{inspired}} by Grohl's divorce from photographer Jennifer Youngblood in 1996, the lyricism {{on the record}} is substantially more introspective and the music more developed. The album's track listing was designed to resemble a therapy session, splitting the album between up-tempo tracks and ballads, reflecting conflicting emotions. Early sessions at Washington farm studio Bear Creek were poor and led the band to discard most of the recordings. The band regrouped without drummer William Goldsmith in early 1997 to record a second time at Hollywood's Grandmaster Recordings, with Grohl sitting in on drums instead. Goldsmith was offended and disgruntled <b>that</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> material was re-recorded and left the band shortly thereafter.|$|E
50|$|Mertz's guitar music, unlike <b>that</b> <b>of</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> contemporaries, {{followed}} the pianistic models of Chopin, Mendelssohn, Schubert and Schumann, {{rather than the}} classical models of Mozart and Haydn (as did Sor and Aguado), or the bel canto style of Rossini (as did Giuliani). Though the date <b>of</b> <b>his</b> birth indicates {{that that was the}} logical influence, since Sor was born in 1778, Aguado in 1784 and Giuliani in 1781 while Mertz in 1806, a difference of about 25 years.|$|R
