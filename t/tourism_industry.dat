40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the experience of}} Brazil in using the administrative record rais (Annual Register on Social Information) to generate statistics for employment in the <b>tourism</b> <b>industries</b> at the subnational level. Overall data for employment in the <b>tourism</b> <b>industries</b> are presented for the national, regional and local level along with the respective maps and, as an illustrative case, comparative statistics of employment and characteristics of workers and establishments in the <b>tourism</b> <b>industries</b> are provided for Brazil, Bahia, Salvador and touristic cities in Bahia. The experience of Brazil shows that administrative records can be a rich data source from which valuable sub-national statistics for tourism can be derived in a relatively inexpensive way. It also suggests that countries with good quality administrative records could benefit from exploring these databases as {{an important source of}} employment statistics for the <b>tourism</b> <b>industries...</b>|$|R

Greuning stated that the project would be similar to Lake Powell, in that it would create a range of recreational activities, including water skiing and picnicking.|$|E
5|$|Malta's <b>tourism</b> <b>industry</b> faces {{a number}} of issues {{impacting}} on it now and threatening to impact on it in the future. One of the clearest issues facing Malta's <b>tourism</b> <b>industry</b> is overcrowding {{as a result of the}} island nation's relatively small size, in terms of both area and population. Malta is a nation of just under 450,000 people, yet its infrastructure is required to support over 1.1 million tourists every year. Malta's water works, roads, waste management systems and beaches are stretched to capacity in the summer months of July and August of every year, when tourism numbers are at their peak. This is a challenge facing Maltese tourism operators as it means that they cannot simply pursue the kinds of 'mass tourism' marketing measures taken by operators in other Mediterranean destinations with more space and resources to pursue them. In addition, Maltese tourism operators must balance increased tourism numbers with the needs of the 'native population', as when resources are stretched thin by tourists during the summer season, there are negative impacts on Maltese residents also.|$|E
5|$|The {{county has}} a {{developed}} <b>tourism</b> <b>industry.</b> The main attractions are the historic sites of Corydon, the county's golf courses, the Horseshoe Riverboat Casino and Hotel, and the area's two famous caves: Squire Boone Caverns near Mauckport and Wyandotte Caves in adjoining Crawford County. The casino is the county's single {{largest source of}} tax revenue and produced $23.5 million in tax revenue during 2007.|$|E

5|$|The <b>tourism</b> <b>industry</b> {{is also a}} {{mainstay}} for communities on the lagoon. Beach-goers must pass the Laguna Madre to reach the prime beaching destination at both North and South Padre Islands. Fishing has drawn tourists to Port Isabel, where the Texas International Fishing Tournament has been held since 1934. Visitors also flock to Bird Island off the western coast of Padre Island, for windsurfing, kayaking, and other water sports.|$|E
5|$|This unique {{geography}} {{has greatly}} influenced Ikata's growth. On the one hand, it has presented significant challenges to urban development {{that were not}} overcome until recently in the town's long history.

5|$|Among other factors, {{the growth}} of {{low-cost}} airline flights to Bratislava, led by Ryanair, has led to conspicuous stag parties, primarily from the UK. While these are a boom to the city's <b>tourism</b> <b>industry,</b> cultural differences and vandalism have led to concern by local officials. Reflecting the popularity of rowdy parties in Bratislava {{in the early to}} mid-2000s, the city was a setting in the 2004 comedy film Eurotrip, which was actually filmed in the city and suburbs of Prague, the Czech Republic.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Palestinian Intifada in 2000–2005, Bethlehem's {{infrastructure}} and <b>tourism</b> <b>industry</b> were damaged.

During the counteroffensive, the IDF besieged the Church of the Nativity, where dozens of Palestinian militants had sought refuge. The siege lasted for 39 days. Several militants were killed. It ended with an agreement to exile 13 of the wanted militants to various foreign countries.|$|E

The largest Adriatic seaport by annual cargo turnover is the Port of Trieste, while the Port of Split is the largest Adriatic seaport by passengers served per year.|$|E
5|$|Following Malvern's new-found fame as a spa {{and area}} of natural beauty, and fully {{exploiting}} its new rail connections, factories {{from as far}} as Manchester were organising day trips for their employees, often attracting as many as 5,000visitors a day. In 1865, a public meeting of residents denounced the rising rail fares– by then twice that of other lines– that were exploiting the <b>tourism</b> <b>industry,</b> and demanded a limitation {{to the number of}} excursion trains. The arrival of the railway also enabled the delivery of coal in large quantities, which accelerated the area's popularity as a winter resort.|$|E

The <b>tourism</b> <b>industry</b> has grown considerably since {{the completion of the}} interstate system in the 1960s, with the Black Hills becoming more important as a destination. The financial service industry began to grow in the state as well, with Citibank moving its credit card operations from New York to Sioux Falls in 1981, a move that has been followed by several other financial companies. South Dakota was the first state to eliminate caps on interest rates.|$|E
