5|$|Having {{defeated}} the last immediate threat to Macedon, Philip returned to diplomacy. He released the Athenian prisoners immediately, and sent ambassadors to Athens. He {{was prepared to}} abandon all claim to Amphipolis, and this, coupled with his treatment of the Athenian prisoners, persuaded the Athenians <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> with him.|$|E
5|$|When the {{ambassador}} returned, he urged Robert <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace,</b> claiming that Alexios wanted nothing but {{friendship with the}} Normans. Robert {{had no intention of}} peace; he sent his son Bohemond with an advance force towards Greece and Bohemond landed at Aulon, with Robert following shortly after.|$|E
5|$|Antalcidas, meanwhile, {{had entered}} into {{negotiations}} with Tiribazus, and {{reached an agreement}} under which the Persians would enter into the war on the Spartan side if the allies refused <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace.</b> It appears that the Persians, unnerved by certain of Athens' actions, including supporting king Evagoras of Cyprus and Akoris of Egypt, {{both of whom were}} at war with Persia, had decided that their policy of weakening Sparta by supporting its enemies was no longer useful. After escaping from the blockade at Abydos, Antalcidas attacked and defeated a small Athenian force, then united his fleet with a supporting fleet sent from Syracuse. With this force, which was soon further augmented with ships supplied by the satraps of the region, he sailed to the Hellespont, where he could cut off the trade routes that brought grain to Athens. The Athenians, mindful of their similar defeat in the Peloponnesian War less than two decades before, were ready <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mel. Only <b>to</b> <b>make</b> my <b>peace</b> {{with you}} before I slept. You {{know you are}} the saint to whom I pay my devotions.|$|R
60|$|Mask. Madam, 'tis {{certainly}} my master; {{and he is}} so zealous <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his <b>peace,</b> that {{he could}} not stay till I called him to you.----Sir.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He who {{has lost}} all here, who has {{incurred}} his grandfather's anger,' pursued Aime, 'were he not wiser <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his <b>peace</b> with his friends in England?' ...|$|R
5|$|In the {{meantime}} Bulgarians and Byzantines had clashed again in 1364. In 1366, when Emperor John V Palaiologos was returning from {{his trip to}} the west, the Bulgarians refused to let him pass through Bulgaria. This stance backfired, as another Byzantine ally, Count Amadeus VI of Savoy, leading the Savoyard crusade, captured several Bulgarian maritime cities in retaliation, including Ankhialos (Pomorie) and Mesembria (Nesebǎr), though he failed to take Varna. Outmanoeuvred, Ivan Alexander was forced <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 1917, Kaiser Wilhelm II {{personally}} {{approved a}} resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare {{in order to}} try to force the British <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace.</b> The new rules of engagement specified that no ship was to be left afloat, although British reports for several of UB-43s victims suggest that von Mellenthin was already operating in this manner.|$|E
5|$|Proceeding {{down the}} Mediterranean coast, the crusaders {{encountered}} little resistance, as local rulers preferred <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> {{with them and}} furnish them with supplies rather than fight, with a notable exception of the abandoned siege of Arqa. On 7 June, the crusaders reached Jerusalem, which had been recaptured from the Seljuqs by the Fatimids only the year before. Many Crusaders wept upon seeing the city they had journeyed so long to reach.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, Gilley began <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the <b>Peace</b> One Day documentary, {{eventually}} {{deciding to}} aim for a UN resolution formalising the idea. This goal was reached in 2001.|$|R
60|$|Isa. Came not Sir Timorous this way, gentlemen? He left {{us in the}} garden, {{and said}} he would look out my Lord Nonsuch, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his <b>peace</b> with him.|$|R
60|$|Alone with Mrs. Ferrari, Mr. Troy {{permitted}} {{his natural}} kindness of heart to show {{itself on the}} surface at last. He tried <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his <b>peace</b> with the courier's wife.|$|R
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of Coloman's absence, Álmos began to conspire against {{the king and}} mustered his armies. Coloman returned from Croatia and marched his army towards his brother's duchy in 1098. The two armies met at Tiszavárkony, with only the river Tisza separating them. However, the commanders of the two troops started negotiations and decided not to fight each other, compelling the king and the duke <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace.</b>|$|E
5|$|The First Macedonian War saw the Romans {{involved}} {{directly in}} only limited land operations. When the Aetolians sued for peace with Philip, Rome's small expeditionary force, {{with no more}} allies in Greece, was ready <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace.</b> Rome had achieved its objective of pre-occupying Philip and preventing him from aiding Hannibal. A treaty was drawn up between Rome and Macedon at Phoenice in 205 BC which promised Rome a small indemnity, formally ending the First Macedonian War.|$|E
5|$|To {{experience}} a detailed {{model of a}} large empire, 4X games are designed with {{a complex set of}} game rules. For example, the player's productivity may be limited by pollution. Players may need to balance a budget, such as managing debt, or paying down maintenance costs. 4X games often model political challenges such as civil disorder, or a senate that can oust the player's political party or force them <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace.</b>|$|E
50|$|Don Manuel and Don Cesar, {{the sons}} of Donna Isabella (the ruling Princess of Messina), are feuding with one another. Overwraught with the situation, Isabella summons her sons to her and manages <b>to</b> help <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> between them.|$|R
60|$|Bertie {{was sorry}} {{when he saw}} that she was hurt by what he said, and he came and squatted on the floor close before her face <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his <b>peace</b> with her.|$|R
5000|$|<b>To</b> <b>make</b> war and <b>peace</b> as he {{sees fit}} and to command the army.|$|R
5|$|After the Ottomans {{defeated}} {{the armies of}} the Holy League {{in a series of}} battles in 1596, Transylvanian noblemen sent letters to Andrew, offering him the principality. After realizing that neither the pope nor the Polish king would support him against Sigismund Báthory, Andrew declared that he was ready <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> with him. He returned to Warmia where he was ordained subdeacon on 4 January 1597. Andrew and Stephen even announced that they would not intervene in Transylvania. Their envoys also started discussions with Sigismund Báthory about the compensation for their expropriated Transylvanian estates.|$|E
5|$|All of Sigismund's {{attempts}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> {{with the}} sultan failed. He sent his envoys to Prague {{to negotiate with}} RudolphII, while his confessor, Carillo, started negotiations with Jan Zamoyski in Poland. At Sigismund's invitation, his cousin, Andrew Báthory, returned from Poland. Sigismund abdicated at the Diet in Medgyes (now Mediaș in Romania) on 21March 1599. Eight days later, the Diet proclaimed Andrew Báthory prince, hoping that Andrew could make peace with the Ottomans {{with the assistance of}} Poland. Sigismund left Transylvania for Poland in June. His marriage with Maria Christierna was declared invalid in Rome in August.|$|E
5|$|At {{a school}} dance, Sean persuades Dallas <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> with Clay while Clay dances with Chelsea. Spencer convinces Ashley to come despite her disdain for school dances, but when Madison sees them together, she alleges that Spencer is gay and kicks Spencer off the cheerleading squad. It is {{revealed}} that Ashley was once pregnant by Aiden and lost {{the baby in}} a miscarriage, and when Glen tries to force Spencer to leave, another fight breaks out between him and Aiden. Spencer and Ashley flee the dance with Aiden and end up at a lookout over LA.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How {{could we}} have hanged Fulke?' said Sir Richard. 'We needed him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> our <b>peace</b> with the King. He would have betrayed half England for the boy's sake. Of that we were sure.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing, thank you--except {{to excuse}} my intrusion. I am afraid I have {{offended}} our little friend there, with the pretty straw hat in his hand, and I want <b>to</b> <b>make</b> my <b>peace</b> with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then as he {{drew her}} nearer, as if <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his <b>peace</b> for his unknown offense, she turned her cheek away and left him silently. Did she fear to find Babie's kiss upon his lips? ...|$|R
5|$|Chulbul {{comes home}} to find his mother dead. He goes to his {{stepfather}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace,</b> as {{he is the only}} family left. His stepfather refuses and despises him as an outcast. Makkhi invites Chulbul to his marriage with Nirmala. Chulbul convinces Rajjo's father to marry her. Rajjo's father commits suicide, as he knows that his daughter will not marry anyone while he is alive. Chulbul takes Rajjo to Makkhi's exuberant wedding. Realising that Makkhi has stolen his money to finance the wedding, Chulbul marries Rajjo in an impromptu ceremony. Nirmala's father feels disgraced and cancels his daughter's wedding.|$|E
5|$|Henry II died in 1189 and was {{succeeded by}} Richard I. Rhys {{considered}} {{that he was}} no longer bound by the agreement with King Henry and attacked the Norman lordships surrounding his territory. He ravaged Pembroke, Haverfordwest, and Gower and captured the castles of St. Clear's, Laugharne, and Llansteffan. Richard's brother, Prince John (later King John), came to Wales in September and tried <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace.</b> He persuaded Rhys to raise the siege of Carmarthen and accompany him to Oxford to meet Richard. Rhys arrived at Oxford to discover that Richard was not prepared to travel there to meet him, and hostilities continued.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius' {{accession}} as Emperor {{did little}} to reduce the Persian threat. Heraclius began his reign by attempting <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> with the Persians, since Phocas, whose actions were the original casus belli, had been overthrown. The Persians rejected these overtures, however, since their armies were widely victorious. According to historian Walter Kaegi, {{it is conceivable that}} the Persians' goal was to restore or even surpass the boundaries of the Achaemenid Empire by destroying the Byzantine empire, though because of the loss of Persian archives, no document survives to conclusively prove this.|$|E
60|$|The innkeeper made a horrid grimace; {{but this}} was a piece of bad luck that might readily befall a tenant in these unruly times, and he was perhaps glad <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his <b>peace</b> so easily.|$|R
60|$|Having {{committed}} one {{error in}} offending her, Moody committed another in attempting <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his <b>peace</b> with her. Acting under {{the fear that}} she would really leave him, he took her roughly by the arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "So be it," [...] {{answered}} Cicely. [...] "God gave it; God save it. In God I put my trust. Murderer, {{leave me}} <b>to</b> <b>make</b> my <b>peace</b> with Him," [...] {{and she turned}} and walked away.|$|R
5|$|Lampugnano, {{unfortunately}} for the Guelphs, was considered a martyr for the Republic. This was made worse {{by the fact that}} the Guelphs in leadership refused to run elections in April, until in June they were forced by the populace. Ghibelline families took the reins of Milan in this election, and the Guelphs were defeated. However, the reprisals against the Guelphs, including the imprisonment of Appiani and Ossona who had been blamed (probably unjustly) for the massacre, led the populace to violently depose the Ghibellines and reinstall the extremist Guelphs. Gonzaga, however, whose friend Galeotto Toscano was killed in the uprising, departed Milan for Crema, hoping <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> with Sforza.|$|E
5|$|Philip II was {{twenty-four years}} old when he acceded to the throne in 359BC. Through the use of deft diplomacy, he was able to {{convince}} the Thracians under Berisades to cease their support of Pausanias, a pretender to the throne, and the Athenians to halt their support of another pretender. He achieved these by bribing the Thracians and their Paeonian allies and establishing a treaty with Athens that relinquished his claims to Amphipolis. He was also able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> with the Illyrians who had threatened his borders.|$|E
5|$|Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov {{informed}} Tokyo of the Soviet Union's unilateral abrogation of the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact on August 5. At {{two minutes}} past midnight on August 9, Tokyo time, Soviet infantry, armor, and air forces had launched the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation. Four hours later, word reached Tokyo of the Soviet Union's official declaration of war. The senior {{leadership of the}} Japanese Army began preparations to impose martial law on the nation, {{with the support of}} Minister of War Korechika Anami, in order to stop anyone attempting <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>peace.</b>|$|E
50|$|He then flew to Berlin {{where on}} 26 September {{he met with}} Göring and Hitler. At that meeting Göring and Hitler were {{completely}} intransigent, willing <b>to</b> only <b>make</b> <b>peace</b> {{on their own terms}} which meant keeping all their conquests and retaining a free hand in Eastern Europe.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, that wouldn't do," [...] Staniford answered. [...] "The {{light of}} your innocence upon hers is invaluable. I can {{understand}} her better through you. You must go on. I will undertake <b>to</b> <b>make</b> your <b>peace</b> with Miss Hibbard." ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{interpretation}} is widely contested because {{it implies that}} Israeli withdrawal is linked to its neighbours' willingness <b>to</b> formally <b>make</b> <b>peace.</b> Competing interpretations of the resolution regard Israel as being obligated to withdraw unilaterally from all territories captured in 1967. Operative paragraph 1 of 242 reads as follows: ...|$|R
