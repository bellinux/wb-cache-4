40|$|Previous light {{microscopic}} {{studies have}} revealed neuropeptide-immunoreactive neurosecretory fibers in the teleostean neurohypophysis, and ultrastructural work has reported direct innervation of endocrine cells by the terminals of fibers penetrating the adenohypophysis. This paper reviews our recent data from ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, receptor localization, and superfusion studies, which suggest {{a role for}} neuropeptides in the control of teleost pituitary secretion. We have used a combination of pre- and post-embedding electron microscopic immunolabeling methods to determine which neuropeptides are present in fibers innervating the pituitaries of three species: Poecilia latipinna, Dicentrarchus labrax, and Clarias gariepinus. Numerous axon profiles with immunoreactivity for the neurosecretory peptides vasotocin and isotocin formed large Herring bodies and terminal-like boutons in contact with corticotropic, growth hormone, thyrotropic, and pars intermedia cells. Numerous melanin-concentrating hormone-immunoreactive fibers and scarcer neurotensin and corticotropin-releasing factor-immunoreactive fibers showed similar distributions, terminating close to pars intermedia and corticotropic cells. Somatostatin, cholecystokinin, galanin, substance P neuropeptide Y, growth hormone-releasing <b>factor,</b> <b>thyrotropin-releasing</b> hormone, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone-immunoreactivities were found in small calibre fibers penetrating among growth hormone, thyrotropic, and gonadotropic cells. These morphological findings have been supplemented by autoradiographic studies, which showed the distribution of binding sites for vasotocin, isotocin, galanin, and neuropeptide Y ligands over specific groups of pituitary cells, and superfusion studies that showed growth hormone release was stimulated by growth hormone-releasing <b>factor</b> and <b>thyrotropin-releasing</b> hormone, but inhibited by somatostatin. The implications of these results for neuropeptidergic control of teleostean pituitary secretions are discussed. (C) 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the dynamics of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol secretion in pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome with bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia presenting as a single adrenal macronodule, and to determine the imaging characteristics of this syndrome. Three female patients were studied. Plasma ACTH and serum cortisol secretion were studied by determining their rhythmicity and pulsatility and their responses to the administration of ovine corticotropin-releasing <b>factor,</b> <b>thyrotropin-releasing</b> hormone, metyrapone, tetracosactrin, insulin and dexamethasone. Techniques used to localize the anatomical lesion were bilateral simultaneous inferior petrosal sinus sampling, magnetic resonance examination of the pituitary, computed tomography (CT) scanning and [75 Se]cholesterol scintigraphy of the adrenal glands. Plasma ACTH and serum cortisol levels were measured using a commercial radioimmunoassay and an immunoradiometric assay. The ACTH and cortisol pulse number and amplitude were calculated using established computer software. In all three patients ACTH and cortisol secretory dynamics fulfilled the requirements for diagnosis of pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome. A close relationship between ACTH and cortisol pulses also favored a pituitary dependency. Study of the amplitude of cortisol pulses classified two patients {{in the group of}} hypopulsatile Cushing's disease. Adrenal CT scanning demonstrated the presence of a large single nodule. [75 Se]Cholesterol scintigraphy showed bilateral radionuclide uptake, although mostly localized over the adrenal nodule. All patients underwent successful trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy. Over a period of 1 year, a slow shrinkage of the adrenal nodule was observed in two patients, while no change in volume was observed in one patient.

40|$|Abstract Introduction While thyrotropin-releasing hormone {{is known}} to be a prolactin-release {{stimulating}} <b>factor,</b> <b>thyrotropin-releasing</b> hormone-tartrate and its derivative, taltirelin hydrate, are used for the treatment of spinocerebellar degeneration, a degenerative disease characterized mainly by motor ataxia. We report the case of a patient being treated with a thyrotropin-releasing hormone preparation for spinocerebellar degeneration who developed amenorrhea after a dose increase. Her hormonal background was analyzed and the effect of prolonged exposure to thyrotropin-releasing hormone on pituitary prolactin-producing cells was examined in vitro. Case presentation Our patient was a 36 -year-old Japanese woman who experienced worsening of gait disturbance at around 23 years of age, and was subsequently diagnosed as having spinocerebellar degeneration. She had been treated with thyrotropin-releasing hormone-tartrate for four years. Taltirelin hydrate was added to the treatment seven months prior to her presentation, followed by an improvement in gait disturbance. Around the same period, she started lactating and subsequently developed amenorrhea three months later. Taltirelin hydrate was discontinued and she was referred to our hospital. She was found to have normal sex hormone levels. A thyrotropin-releasing hormone provocation test showed a normal response of thyroid-stimulating hormone level and an over-response of prolactin at 30 minutes (142. 7 ng/mL). Resumption of menstruation was noted three months after dose reduction of thyrotropin-releasing hormone. In our in vitro study, following long-term exposure to thyrotropin-releasing hormone, cells from the rat pituitary prolactin-producing cell line GH 3 exhibited an increased basal prolactin promoter activity but showed a marked decrease in responsiveness to thyrotropin-releasing hormone. Conclusions Physicians should be aware of hyperprolactinemia-associated side effects in patients receiving thyrotropin-releasing hormone treatment. Long-term treatment with a thyrotropin-releasing hormone preparation might cause a large amount of prolactin to accumulate in prolactin-producing cells and be released in response to exogenous thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{addition}} of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) to primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells modifies {{their response to}} <b>thyrotropin-releasing</b> <b>factor</b> in a dose-dependent manner. While the pituitary response to the other releasing factors (corticotropin-releasing factor, growth hormone-releasing factor, and gonadotropin-releasing factor) is not altered, FGF increases both {{the sensitivity of the}} cells to <b>thyrotropin-releasing</b> <b>factor</b> and the amounts of prolactin and thyrotropin released. A minimum of 24 hr of preincubation with FGF is required to modify the pituitary response, and maximal effects were observed with 48 and 72 hr of preincubation. The effective doses of FGF are similar to those described for its mitogenic activity (i. e., 1 - 100 pM), but inhibition of cell growth with 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine does not modify the effect of FGF on thyrotropin and prolactin release. These results suggest a novel paracrine, if not autocrine, role of pituitary FGF in the homeostatic mechanisms that regulate the secretion of prolactin and thyrotropin. They also suggest that the biological significance of the presence of FGF in various tissues may not be directly related to its in vitro mitogenic activity...|$|E
40|$|The antinociceptive and hypothermic {{effects of}} intracisternal {{administration}} of 11 endogenous neuropeptides and morphine were evaluated in mice. Of the substances tested, only neurotensin (NT) and beta-endorphin exerted significant antinociceptive and hypothermic effects; NT {{was the most}} potent in inducing hypothermia whereas beta-endorphin was the most potent antinociceptive agent via this route of administration. Both NT, and beta-endorphin were, on a molar basis, considerably more potent antinociceptive agents than morphine, [Met]enkephalin, or [Leu]enkephalin. NT-induced analgesia and hypothermia both were significantly dose-dependent. Substance P was found to produce significant hyperalgesia and hyperthermia. Bombesin produced a significant hypothermic effect, whereas somatostatin and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (luliberin) produced hyperthermia. None of the other peptides studies [bradykinin, <b>thyrotropin-releasing</b> <b>factor</b> (thyroliberin), melanocyte-stimulating hormone release-inhibiting factor (melanostatin), somatostatin, [Met]enkephalin, and [Leu]enkephalin] produced any significant alterations in colonic temperature or response to a noxious stimulus with the doses tested. These data demonstrate that NT and beta-endorphin, two endogenous brain peptides, are potent in inducing hypothermia and in producing an antinociceptive state...|$|E
40|$|Although other hormones {{influence}} {{the quantity of}} milk secretion, prolactin and adrenal corticosteroids are essential for initiating and maintaining lactation. During pregnancy high levels of estrogen and progesterone inhibit lactation, and elevation of prolactin and ACTH-adrenal corticosteroid levels result in the initiation of lactation {{at the end of}} pregnancy. Suckling maintains lactation through release of prolactin, ACTH-adrenal glucocorticoid, and oxytocin. The hypothalamus contains a prolactin-inhibiting factor (PIF) and probably also a prolactin-releasing factor (PRF). The <b>thyrotropin-releasing</b> <b>factor</b> (TRF) induces release of prolactin. Catecholamines and acetylcholine depress prolactin, and serotonin results in increased release. Estradiol, thyroxin, and thyrotropin directly cause prolactin release in vitro, while dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine inhibit release although small doses may stimulate prolactin release. Ergot drugs and sodium pentobarbital inhibit in vitro prolactin release, and estradiol and ergot drugs act on the hypothalamus as well. In spontaneous galactorrheas associated with amenorrhea, high blood prolactin levels are found, while in idiopathic galactorrheas with no menstrual abnormalities the prolactin blood levels are normal. Reserpine, phenothiazine derivatives, haloperidol, and other drugs increase prolactin release, while L-dopa and ergots can inhibit lactation after parturition as well as spontaneous galactorrheas...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} studies on the {{differentiation}} of the preoptic nucleus and of experiments regarding the effects of propylthiouracil and extirpation of the preoptic area demonstrate that in Xenopus laevis tadpoles a <b>thyrotropin-releasing</b> <b>factor</b> (TRF) is formed in peptidergic cells in the dorsal part of the preoptic nucleus. The differentiation of this nucleus depends on thyroid hormones, {{but at the same}} time these hormones inhibit the activity of the TRF cells. Young larvae of X. laevis acquire the ability to adapt themselves to a white background simultaneously with the appearance of aminergic neurosecretory centers in the caudal hypothalamus. During prometamorphosis these centers comprise a paraventricular organ (PVO), a nucleus infundibularis, fiber tracts to the telencephalon and to the pars intermedia of the adenohypophysis, and a nucleus in the caudalmost part of the dorsal tuber cinereum. The PVO consists of sensory nerve cells and cells secreting products into the cerebrospinal fluid; the infundibular nucleus contains numerous liquor-contacting neurons. The aminergic neurosecretory cells contain catecholamines such as dopamine. Depletion of these cells by reserpine leads to a dispersion of melanin granules in the skin melanophores. It is believed that among the functions of the aminergic neurosecretory centers is the production of a melanotropin-inhibiting factor. In the ventral tuber cinereum of X. laevis, neurosecretory cells are situated that are neither peptidergic nor aminergic. They are more active in adult animals than in tadpole...|$|E

In non-mammalian vertebrates, CRH not only acts as a neurotransmitter and hypophysiotropin, it also acts as a potent <b>thyrotropin-releasing</b> <b>factor,</b> allowing CRH to regulate both the adrenal and thyroid axes, especially in development. The recent discovery {{of a family of}} CRH-like peptides suggests that multiple CRH-like ligands may play important roles in these functions. The biological effects of CRH and the other CRH-like ligands are mediated and modulated not only by CRH receptors, but also via a highly conserved CRH-binding protein (CRH-BP). The CRH-BP has been identified not only in mammals, but also in non-mammalian vertebrates includ-ing fishes, amphibians, and birds, suggesting that it is a phylogenetically ancient protein with extensive structural and functional conservation. In this review, we discuss the biochemical properties of the characterized CRH-BPs and the functional roles of the CRH-BP. While much of the in vitro and in vivo data to date support an ‘inhibitory ’ role for the CRH-BP in which it binds CRH and other CRH-like ligands and prevents the activation of CRH receptors, the possibility that the CRH-BP may also exhibit diverse extra- and intracellular roles in a cell-specific fashion and at specific times in development is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Several {{cases of}} {{thyrotoxicosis}} with normal triiodothyro-nine values {{have been reported}} recently. We report an additional case, in which the normal triiodothyronine values by radioimmunoassay seemingly are ascribable {{to the effect of}} nonthyroidal illness, in that there was evidence of enhanced reverse-triiodothyronineformation. AddItionalK. yphrases: thyroid status. “reverse ” trllodo-thyronine. thyrotropin. thyroliberin Several recent case reports have suggested that thyroxine thyrotoxicosis is a distinct clinical entity (1 - 3). This requires demonstration of an increased concentration of thyroxine (T 4) in serum with concomitantly normal or low triiodothyronine (T 3), in a patient with clinical hyperthyroidism. 2 Because isolated laboratory values are not infallible in the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism (4 - 6), we believe that the demonstration of gland autonomy via provocative or suppressive testing is required in equivocal cases. The patient described here showed a lack of stimulation of thyrotropin (thyroid-stimu-lating hormone) by thyroliberin (<b>thyrotropin-releasing</b> <b>factor).</b> Materials and Methods TotalT 4 was assayed by a solid-phase radioimmunoassay procedure(ClinicalAssays,Inc.,Cambridge,MA 02139). In-terassay coefficient of variation (CV) with this procedure was 7. 9 % at 35 sg/L and 4. 8 % at 108 tgfL. The normal range for T 4 was 50 - 120 tg/L. We assessed the amount of thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) by measuring [1251]T 3 binding by the patient’s serum, with use of talc as a separating reagent. The radioactivity in the TBG-bound fraction was counted and a ratio of standard normal pool serum and the patient’s sample was calculated. The normal range for this ratio was 0. 9 - 1. 18. To calculate the free-T 4 index, we multiplied the total T 4 value with this ratio, which in fact corrects total T 3 values for al-terations in TBG. We measured T 3 by a double-antibody radioimmunoassay procedure. The method previously described (7) was used, with modifications. 8 -Anilino- 1 -naphthalene sulfonic acid was used to inhibit the TBG binding. The interassay variation at 1. 6 zg/L was 9 %. The reference interval for T 3 in sera of 55 normal subjects was 1 to 2. 8 ig/L. Reverse T 3 in serum was radioimmunoassayed at th...|$|E
