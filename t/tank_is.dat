25|$|Modern LNG storage <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} {{full containment}} type, {{which has a}} prestressed concrete outer wall and a high-nickel steel inner tank, with extremely efficient insulation between the walls. Large <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> low aspect ratio (height to width) and cylindrical in design with a domed steel or concrete roof. Storage pressure in these <b>tanks</b> <b>is</b> very low, less than 10kPa (1.45psig). Sometimes more expensive underground <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> used for storage.|$|R
50|$|Development of a tank {{classification}} system started in World War I, when <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> separated into light tanks and tankettes, medium tanks, and heavy tanks, based on size and weight. Heavy <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> {{required to be}} large to cross trenches, and consequently weighed a lot. Medium <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> smaller and had help to cross trenches so weighed less. Light <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> much smaller and lightweight, allowing transport on lorries (trucks).|$|R
5000|$|One <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> made, and the <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> tested, {{but found}} wanting {{in regards to}} the power train. The tank {{resulted}} in a further developed tank, the M1922, produced a year later[...] The <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> tested until 1926, after which its wheareabouts were not known.|$|R

5|$|The Water Tower {{is located}} on the northwestern side of the island, near Tower No. 3, beyond the Morgue and Recreation Yard. The water <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> {{situated}} on six cross-braced steel legs submerged in concrete foundations.|$|E
50|$|Another {{refinery}} employee {{commented that}} these large oil storage <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> sometimes purposely floated {{in order to}} move them. The containment levees around the <b>tank</b> <b>are</b> generally filled with water and <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> moved in this way around <b>tank</b> farms. This <b>is</b> done on a planned basis with all oil removed from the tank being moved.|$|R
5|$|Additional fuel <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> fitted and {{the design}} of the <b>tanks</b> <b>was</b> changed to {{accommodate}} the change from gasoline to kerosene.|$|R
50|$|The test prototypes of the <b>tank</b> <b>were</b> {{evaluated}} in 1993. Six semi-industrial prototypes of the <b>tank</b> <b>were</b> produced and tested in 1997.|$|R
5|$|A diving {{cylinder}}, scuba tank or diving <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> a {{gas cylinder}} used to store and transport the high pressure breathing gas required by a scuba set. It {{may also be}} used for surface-supplied diving or as decompression gas or an emergency gas supply for surface supplied diving or scuba. Cylinders provide gas to the diver through the demand valve of a diving regulator or the breathing loop of a diving rebreather.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall in the {{dry zone}} of Sri Lanka is limited to 50-75inches. Under these conditions, rain fed {{cultivation}} was difficult, forcing early settlers to develop means to store water {{in order to maintain}} a constant supply of water for their cultivations. Small irrigation tanks were constructed at village level, to support the cultivations of that village. The earliest medium-scale irrigation <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> the Basawakkulama reservoir built by King Pandukabhaya. Nuwara wewa and Tissa Wewa reservoirs were constructed a century later. These reservoirs were enlarged in subsequent years by various rulers.|$|E
5|$|T-26 mod. 1933 in the Parola Tank Museum (Finland): this <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> {{described}} in many sources as {{early version of}} the T-26 mod. 1933. But in reality this is the Finnish war-time modernization (Finnish tactical number Ps163â€“16) of a hull from KhT-26 flame-throwing tank (which can be identified by rivets for mounting of a burning mixture tank, rivets for hinges of a filling hatch {{on the left side}} and a welded drain port on the right side behind a front track bogie) with a mounted riveted turret with a small rear niche from the early BT-5 light tank.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> {{partially}} {{destroyed by}} a fire in 1927. It was rebuilt and operational in 1930, and was used up to the 1940s. Then the <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> used as a pressure tank to support other wind-tunnel activities at Langley. In 1978, the <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> taken out of service; it survives on display.|$|R
50|$|The {{first series}} <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> {{delivered}} on 25 October 1979. By 1982 {{the first batch}} of 380 Leopard 2 <b>tanks</b> <b>was</b> completed. 209 were built by Krauss-Maffei (chassis no. 10001 to 10210) and 171 by MaK (chassis no. 20001 to 20172). The first production <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> fitted with the PzB-200 image intensifier due to production shortages of the new thermal night-sight system, which was later retrofitted to the earlier models. After the original five batches, three further batches of Leopard 2 <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> ordered, {{increasing the amount of}} Leopard 2 tanks ordered by Germany to a total of 2,125. The sixth batch was ordered in June 1987 and consisted of 150 <b>tanks,</b> which <b>were</b> produced between January 1988 and May 1989. The seventh batch of 100 <b>tanks</b> <b>was</b> produced between May 1988 and April 1990. The last batch for the German army totalling 75 <b>tanks</b> <b>was</b> produced from January 1991 to March 1992.|$|R
50|$|At {{least three}} <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> {{deployed}} from Chernihiv on 22 January 2014. Officially the <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> being {{transferred to the}} Odessa Oblast and not be going to Kiev. On January 23, 2014 {{it was announced that}} due to the complicated situation in the country all <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> returned to their place of permanent base.|$|R
5|$|Many households, {{and some}} small communities, rely on {{rainwater}} for their drinking water supplies. Roof-fed systems are highly vulnerable to contamination by ashfall, {{as they have}} a large surface area relative to the storage tank volume. In these cases, leaching of chemical contaminants from the ashfall can become a health risk and drinking of water is not recommended. Prior to an ashfall, downpipes should be disconnected so that water in the <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> protected. A further {{problem is that the}} surface coating of fresh volcanic ash can be acidic. Unlike most surface waters, rainwater generally has a very low alkalinity (acid-neutralising capacity) and thus ashfall may acidify tank waters. This may lead to problems with plumbosolvency, whereby the water is more aggressive towards materials that it comes into contact with. This can be a particular problem if there are lead-head nails or lead flashing used on the roof, and for copper pipes and other metallic plumbing fittings.|$|E
5|$|On {{cross-country}} flights on {{days when}} strong lift is forecast, pilots fly with water ballast stored in tanks or bags in the wings and fin. The fin <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> used to reduce trim drag by optimizing the center of gravity, which typically would shift forward if water is stored only in the wings ahead of the spar. Ballast enables a sailplane to attain its best L/D at higher speeds but slows its climb rate in thermals, in part because a sailplane with a heavier wing loading cannot circle within a thermal as tightly as one with a lower, unballasted wing loading. But if lift is strong, typically either from thermals or wave, the disadvantage of slower climbs is outweighed by the higher cruising speeds between lift areas. Thus, the pilot can improve the average speed over a course by several percent or achieve longer distances in a given time. If lift is weaker than expected, or if an off-field landing is imminent, the pilot can jettison the water ballast by opening the dump valves.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tank</b> <b>is</b> an arcade game {{developed}} by Kee Games, {{a subsidiary of}} Atari, and released in November 1974. It was the only original title not based on an existing Atari property {{developed by}} Kee Games, which was founded to sell clones of Atari games to distributors as a fake competitor prior to the merger of the two companies. In the game, two players drive tanks through a maze viewed from above while attempting to shoot each other and avoid mines, represented by X marks, in a central minefield. Each player controls their tank {{with a pair of}} joysticks, moving them forwards and back to drive, reverse, and steer, and firing shells with a button to attempt to destroy the other tank. The destruction of a tank from a mine or shell earns the opposing player a point, and tanks reappear after being destroyed. The winner is the player with more points when time runs out, with each game typically one or two minutes long.|$|E
40|$|One key {{to clean}} {{freshwater}} {{is to prevent}} hazardous liquid spills from {{taking place in the}} first place. An important element to spill prevention is the safe storage of hazardous liquids in tanks that comply with national standards. Tanks come in many shapes and forms. Large <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> erected in the field. Smaller <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> produced in a factory and shipped to the site for installation. Shop-built <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> made for underground installations and for aboveground installations. Aboveground <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> either oriented for horizontal or vertical installation, and are produced in either cylindrical form or rectangular form. The <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> capable of being designed and fabricated as pressure vessels, but are more typically vented to atmosphere. The tank can have compartments internal to the <b>tank.</b> <b>Tanks</b> <b>are</b> often secondarily contained. The <b>tank</b> can <b>be</b> insulated for fire safety or temperature control. Corrosion protection can be given to exterior tank bottoms in contact with soil or to the tank interior with special coatings and linings. Some aboveground <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> even installed in an underground vault or room, without backfill. This paper presents tank standards covering shop-fabricated aboveground tan...|$|R
25|$|Drop tanks, {{external}} tanks, wing tanks, pylon tanks or belly <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> all terms used {{to describe}} auxiliary externally mounted fuel <b>tanks.</b> Drop <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> generally expendable and often jettisonable. External <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> commonplace on modern military aircraft and occasionally found in civilian ones, although the latter {{are less likely to}} be discarded except in the event of emergency.|$|R

25|$|The shuttle's main fuel <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> {{covered in}} thermal {{insulation}} foam {{intended to prevent}} ice from forming when the <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> full of liquid hydrogen and oxygen. Such ice could damage the shuttle if shed during lift-off.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Tank</b> <b>is</b> a gigantic, muscular {{infected}} {{that has}} the ability to swipe at survivors, knocking them off their feet and incapacitating them; it can also throw rocks and knock cars and other debris into the survivors. The Tank looks like its lower jaw is missing, but it's actually hidden in its neck muscle. The <b>Tank</b> <b>is</b> the most durable of all the special infected, and requires the full support of all of the survivors in order to be killed. The <b>Tank</b> <b>is</b> accompanied by a booming orchestral score to signal his appearance.|$|E
