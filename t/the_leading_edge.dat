5|$|A cold front's {{location}} is at <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can {{move up to}} {{twice as fast as}} warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, at <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of the cooler air mass.|$|E

40|$|The {{steady-state}} aerodynamic {{characteristics of}} a new family of blunted <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> immersed in a high-speed rarefied air flow are examined by using a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) Method. A very {{detailed description of the}} flow properties has been presented separately at the vicinity of the nose and adjacent to the afterbody surface of <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> by a numerical method that properly accounts for non-equilibrium effects that arise near <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> and that are especially important at high Mach number. Comparisons based on geometry are made between these new blunt configurations and round <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> Some significant differences between these <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> are noted on the flowfield structure and on the aerodynamic surface quantities. It is found that the upstream effects have different influence on velocity, density, pressure and temperature along the stagnation streamline ahead of <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges.</b> <b>The</b> analysis also shows that, despite the seeming advantages of <b>the</b> new blunt <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> shapes, round <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> still provides smaller stagnation point heating. Nevertheless, round <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> provides larger total drag than the new blunt shapes under the range of condition investigated...|$|R

5|$|At some {{distance}} back from <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge,</b> the smooth laminar flow breaks down and transitions to a turbulent flow. From a drag standpoint, it is advisable {{to have the}} transition from laminar to turbulent flow as far aft on the wing as possible, or have {{a large amount of}} the wing surface within the laminar portion of the boundary layer. The low energy laminar flow, however, tends to break down more suddenly than the turbulent layer.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the preliminary {{results on the}} aeroacoustic and aerodynamic performances of a NACA 65 -(12) 10 aerofoil subjected to 12 sinusoidal <b>leading</b> <b>edges.</b> <b>The</b> serration patterns of these <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> are formed by cutting into {{the main body of}} the aerofoil, instead of extending <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges.</b> Any of <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edges,</b> when attached to {{the main body of the}} aerofoil, will always result in the same overall chord length. The experiment was mainly performed in an aeroacoustic wind tunnel facility, although a separate aerodynamic type wind tunnel was also used for the force measurements. These sinusoidal <b>leading</b> <b>edges</b> were investigated for their effectiveness in suppressing the laminar instability tonal noise (trailing edge self-noise) and turbulence–leading edge interaction noise. The largest reduction in aerofoil noise tends to associate with <b>the</b> sinusoidal <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of <b>the</b> largest amplitude, and smallest wavelength. However, noticeable noise increase at high frequency is also observed for this combination of serration. In terms of the aerodynamic performance, increasing the serration wavelength tends to improve the stall angles, but the lift coefficient at the pre-stall regime is generally lower than that produced by <b>the</b> baseline <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> For a sinusoidal <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> with large serration amplitude, the effect of the reduction in “lift-generating ” surface is manifested in the significant reduction of the lift coefficients and lift curve slope. <b>The</b> sinusoidal <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> that produces <b>the</b> best performance in the post-stall regime belongs to the largest wavelength and smallest amplitude, where the lift coefficients are shown to be better than <b>the</b> baseline <b>leading</b> <b>edge.</b> In conclusion, large amplitude and small wavelength is beneficial for noise reduction, whilst to maintain the aerodynamic lift a small amplitude and large wavelength is preferred.

5|$|To {{adapt the}} {{original}} Su-27 for naval operations, Sukhoi first incorporated a reinforced structure and undercarriage {{to withstand the}} great stress experienced upon landing, particularly quick descents and non-flare landings (landings where the aircraft does not 'float' and slow its decent rate just prior to touchdown). <b>The</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> slats, flaperons and other control surfaces are enlarged to provide increased lift and manoeuvrability at low speeds, although the wingspan remains unchanged. The wings feature double-slotted flaps and outboard drooping ailerons; in total, the refinements enlarge the wing area by 10–12%. The wings and stabilators are modified for folding to maximise the number of aircraft the carrier can accommodate and to allow ease of movement on deck. The aircraft is outfitted with more powerful turbofan engines to increase thrust-to-weight ratio, {{as well as an}} in-flight refuelling probe. The Su-33 sports canards that shorten the take-off distance and improve manoeuvrability, but have required reshaping of <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> root extensions (LERX). The rear radome is shortened and reshaped to prevent its striking the deck during high-Alpha (angle of attack) landings.|$|E
5|$|Warm fronts are at <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of a {{homogeneous}} warm air mass, {{which is located}} on the equatorward edge of the gradient in isotherms, and lie within broader troughs of low pressure than cold fronts.

5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated deicing systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on <b>the</b> <b>leading</b> <b>edge</b> of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|E
