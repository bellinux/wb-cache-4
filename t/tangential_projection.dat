We propose a full gradient and a normal gradient based stabilization computed on the background mesh to render the proposed formulation stable and well conditioned irrespective of the surface positioning within the mesh.

40|$|In {{order to}} employ {{continuum}} {{models in the}} analysis of the flow behaviour of a viscous Newtonian fluid in micro scale devices, it is necessary to consider at the wall surfaces appropriate slip boundary conditions instead of the classical non-slip condition. The slip behaviour in the case of micro fluid flow of rarefied gases is associated with the combined effect of reduction in momentum transfer due to the {{reduction in the number of}} molecules (shear creep) and the thermal creep or transpiration, which as a consequence of inequalities in temperatures, forces the fluid to slide over a surface from colder to hotter regions. In this work a boundary integral equation formulation for Stokes slip flow, based on the normal and <b>tangential</b> <b>projection</b> of the Green’s integral representational formulae for the Stokes velocity field, which directly incorporates into the integral equations the local tangential shear rate and heat flux at the wall surfaces, is presented.

40|$|Abstract. The {{principle}} of {{wall thickness measurement}} and monitoring of corrosion and deposits by means of film-based <b>tangential</b> <b>projection</b> radiography is known since decades. Nevertheless, there are no international standards and guidelines available. The International Atomic Energy Agency has organized a co-ordinated research programme bringing together participants from twelve member states to study {{the state of the}} art. The general scope of the project covered radiographic inspection of corrosion and deposits in steel pipes (diameter> 150 mm) corroded on the outer or inner surfaces with or without insulation. Two inspection methods have been investigated: 1. tangential radiographic projection technique (TRT) and 2. double wall inspection technique (DWT). The application ranges of both methods were studied depending on pipe diameter, wall thickness, radiation source (X-ray, Ir- 192 and Co- 60 were used) and screen/film combination. Diagrams for application limits using TRT have been designed and verified by the participating countries. All measurements have been performed on special designed test pieces and also industrial pipes. Corrosion measurements based on DWT are more sophisticated and use effective attenuation coefficients to calculate wall thickness changes from density differences shown on the film. The values of effective attenuation coefficients, established for Ir- 192 and Co- 60, are stable and independent in a wide range on pipe diameter and insulation. Guidelines were developed and tested in the twelve different countries to determine the reliability of this technology.

From series of tangential sections we reconstructed the axon collaterals of individual layer VI pyramidal neurons in the C 2 barrel column that were labelled with biocytin [controls from normal (NOR) strain, 19 cells; BRL strain, nine cells]. Using six morphological parameters in a cluster analysis, we showed that layer VI neurons in NOR mice are distributed into four clusters distinguished by the radial and tangential extent of their intracortical projections. These clusters correlated with the cortical or subcortical projection of the main axon. In BRL mice, neurons were distributed within the same four clusters, but their projections to the granular and supragranular layers were significantly smaller and their <b>tangential</b> <b>projection</b> was less columnar than in NOR mice. However, in both strains the intracortical projections had a preference for the appropriate barrel column (C 2), indicating that layer VI pyramidal cells could participate in the functional columnar organization of the barrel cortex.

40|$|In recent years, {{due to the}} {{acquisition}} of higher-quality data covering greater survey volumes, streaming motions observed in the Galactic disc have gained importance in understanding the processes involved in galaxy formation and evolution. Here, we use data from the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) and the Tycho-Gaia astrometric solution catalogue (TGAS) to compute the velocity fields yielded by the radial (VR), azimuthal (Vphi) and vertical (Vz) components of associated Galactocentric velocity. We search in particular for variation in all three velocity components with distance {{above and below the}} disc midplane, as well as how each component of Vz (line-of-sight and <b>tangential</b> velocity <b>projections)</b> modifies the obtained vertical structure. To study the dependence of velocity on proper motion and distance we use two main samples: a RAVE sample including proper motions from the Tycho- 2, PPMXL and UCAC 4 catalogues, and a RAVE-TGAS sample with inferred distances and proper motions from the TGAS and UCAC 5 catalogues. In both samples, we identify asymmetries in VR and Vz. Below the plane we find the largest radial gradient to be dVR / dR = - 7. 01 +- 0. 61 km kpc, in agreement with recent studies. Above the plane we find a similar gradient with dVR / dR= - 9. 42 +- 1. 77 km kpc. By comparing our results with previous studies, we find that the structure in Vz is strongly dependent on the adopted proper motions. Using the Galaxia Milky Way model, we demonstrate that distance uncertainties can create artificial wave-like patterns. In contrast to previous suggestions of a breathing mode seen in RAVE data, our results support a combination of bending and breathing modes, likely generated by a combination of external or internal and external mechanisms. This can be interpreted as a superposition of more than one wave existing simultaneously in the Milky Way disc. Comment: 19 p., 17 fig., submitted to MNRA...|$|R
