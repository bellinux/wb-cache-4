Ruled surfaces are forms generated by a straight line known as the generatrix, as it moves over one or several lines known as directrices. Gaudí found abundant examples of them in nature, for instance in rushes, reeds and bones; {{he used to say}} that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> structure than the trunk of a tree or a human skeleton. These forms are at the same time functional and aesthetic, and Gaudí discovered how to adapt the language of nature to the structural forms of architecture. He used to equate the helicoid form to movement and the hyperboloid to light. Concerning ruled surfaces, he said: ...|$|E

500|$|Calvert {{dispatched}} Captain Edward Wynne and a {{group of}} Welsh colonists to Ferryland, where they landed in August 1621, and set about constructing a settlement. Wynne sent positive reports concerning the potential for local fisheries and for the production of salt, hemp, flax, tar, iron, timber and hops. Wynne also praised the climate, declaring, [...] "It is better and not so cold as England," [...] and predicted that the colony would become self-sufficient after one year. Others corroborated Wynne's reports: for example, Captain Daniel Powell, who delivered a further party of settlers to Ferryland, wrote: [...] "The land on which our Governor [...] planted is so good and commodious, that for the quantity, I think <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> in many parts of England"; but he added ominously that Ferryland was [...] "the coldest harbour in the land". Wynne and his men began work on various building projects, including a substantial house and the shoring up of the harbour. To protect them against marauding French warships, a recent hazard in the area, since the recent founding of New France in the interior (modern Lower Canada of the 18th and 19th centuries, Province of Quebec and Dominion of Canada) along the St. Lawrence River, Calvert employed the pirate John Nutt.|$|E
500|$|During the mid-1980s, {{heavy metal}} music divided into {{autonomous}} subgenres. Weinstein (2000) described the [...] thematic diversity that cross-cuts musical styles: [...] "In the 1980s, white metal and black metal emerged. Their lyrical themes are at polar opposites to each other, {{one of them}} bringing the 'good news' and the other the 'bad news.' Both include bands whose sounds span {{the full spectrum of}} metal. White metal is commonly called Christian metal. In part a response to the popularity of the heavy metal genre, it transforms the code of heavy metal to serve purposes of Evangelical Christian sects and other denominations. In part, also, Christian metal is a well-crafted missionary effort to recruit members and save souls. [...] Black metal stands in the thematic opposition to Christianity, not looking upward to heaven but setting its sights on the underworld. Satanic symbols and imagery have been a staple of heavy metal since its beginnings with Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin. In the West, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> symbol for rebellion. But groups such as Mercyful Fate claimed that they were not playing. Their claims to be true believers, followers of the lord of the underworld, were seen by many to be a commercial ploy." [...] Chicago Doom Metal group Trouble was known to be the first band that was publicly marketed as [...] "white metal" [...] since their early albums Psalm 9 and The Skull feature Biblical references. The origin of the [...] "white metal" [...] term remains unclear; it is merely known that the non-Christian label Metal Blade Records used [...] "white metal" [...] as a marketing term, in contrast to black metal.|$|E

2500|$|Wolfram {{suggests}} that the theory of computational irreducibility may provide a resolution {{to the existence of}} free will in a nominally deterministic universe. [...] He posits that the computational process in the brain of the being with free will is actually complex enough so that it cannot be captured in a simpler computation, due to the principle of computational irreducibility. [...] Thus, while the process is indeed deterministic, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> way to determine the being's will than, in essence, to run the experiment and let the being exercise it.|$|E

The European Union proposed the idea to UEFA as a way of recognising the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, which was signed on 25 March 1957 and laid the foundations for a united Europe and the European Union itself. A football match was chosen as the showpiece event as the way football brings people of all different nationalities together was viewed as a symbolic representation of how Europe was brought together politically. José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, said, [...] "The best of European football will be on show in Manchester next March to mark the 50th anniversary of the creation of the European Union. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>better</b> way to showcase the European Union at 50 than through Europe's favourite sport that unites Europeans in a unique way, through a passion we all share and a language we all speak." ...|$|E
