40|$|Within the Oil industry, subsea {{pipelines}} {{are used}} to transport hydrocarbons from one location to another. After the installation of a subsea pipeline, the final connection between the pipeline ant the interconnecting facilities are done by using tie-in spools. In principle, tie-in spools serve two purposes. First, it needs to provide an interface that bridges the inaccuracies associated with offshore pipeline installation. Inaccuracies related to pipeline installation are numerous, but {{can be related to}} the existing seabed infrastructure, orientation/position of the tie-in facilities with respect to pipeline installation vessel, bathymetry & soil accuracy of data among others. These factors cause the <b>tie-in</b> <b>spool</b> to be measured, fabricated and installed after the pipeline has been laid in order to make up the connection. Secondly, the <b>tie-in</b> <b>spool</b> needs to be a flexible element as pipelines expands during operational conditions because of heat and pressure differences between installation and operational stages. By the <b>tie-in</b> <b>spool</b> being flexible, the forces in connectors are reduced in order to ensure safe transportation of hydrocarbons. These key requirements can have significant impact of the overall cost of a project as they will affect all necessary operations related to tie-in spools. This report assesses key requirements related to tie-in spools by a detailed review about issues related to the design, fabrication, installation and operation of tie-in spools. By presenting details from the design of an actual installed <b>tie-in</b> <b>spool</b> in the southern North Sea this is sought achieved. By presenting a <b>tie-in</b> <b>spool</b> and its important design parameters, load steps that it is subjected to, and the results from loading analysis it is wanted to educate about the importance of tie-in spools. A modification of the <b>tie-in</b> <b>spool</b> where done to develop a simple technique to quickly assess the preliminary design/configuration of a <b>tie-in</b> <b>spool</b> based on bending moment capacity of the associated connector. The design parameters, such as pipeline expansion, where extracted from the presented tie-in analysis. Four different analysis methods where used in order to give recommendations on which method are most suited for spool piece analysis. By comparing results with the actual installed spool, calculated results showed that three methods can be suited for simplified spool piece analysis. In order to qualify one of the analysis methods, a downscaled <b>tie-in</b> <b>spool</b> was manufactured based on the modified spool. By innovative use of simple mechanical equipment, the <b>tie-in</b> <b>spool</b> was applied pipeline expansion via a winch. The bending moment in the connector where measured using an adjustable torque wrench. Measured bending moment was compared to the analysis methods and by comparison it was evident that numbers did not correlate. Due to this, no further recommendation on suitable analysis method could be given. A search for possible error sources contributing to no correlation was conducted. It is also proposed further development of experiment...|$|E
40|$|The {{last four}} decades have {{witnessed}} {{a significant change}} in the oil and gas offshore industry where field developments have moved from shallow water (10 metres to 100 metres) to deep water (100 metres to 1000 metres) and currently ultra deep water, 1000 metre and deeper. The subsea structures, components and pipelines have to stand such high external hydrostatic pressure which becomes in some cases the governing design criteria rather than the well pressure and temperature. This study focuses on pipe induction bends, which is a vital element in any ultra deep water subsea system. Bends are mainly used in the <b>tie-in</b> <b>spools</b> to connect pipeline end structures to manifolds or to well head trees. A significant amount of work has been conducted to study the behaviour of pipe bends under internal pressure in the last 150 years for its widely used applications in power plants, processing facilities and generic industrial use, however, minimal work has been conducted for pipe bends under external pressure for its rare applications. Oil and gas explorations and developments started to increase the demand of better understanding the pipe bend behaviour under high external pressure. As a result of the lack of knowledge and experimental work in this area, codes and standards have either considered it as a piping component or recommended quite stringent design criteria that more fits shallow water applications but is almost impossible to comply with deep water applications. Designers end up with required pipe wall thicknesses that exceed the manufacturing capabilities and the practical welding limits. This research investigates the failure modes of pipe bends subjected to external pressure and bending moments and presents a guideline on how to model, analyse and design these vital components for the subsea oil and gas fields developments. A limit state design criteria is proposed to enable the design of pipe bends, the proposed limit state design is in alignment with the current limit state design for pipelines...|$|R
