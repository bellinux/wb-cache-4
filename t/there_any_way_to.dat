The camera was capable of storing eight photos at 640×480 resolution, 32 photos at 320×240 resolution, or a mixture of both sizes. All photos were at 24-bit color.

50|$|Macular {{degeneration}} is {{a condition}} affecting the tissues lying under the retina, while a macular hole involves damage from within the eye, at the junction between the vitreous and the retina itself. There is no {{relationship between the two}} diseases. Depending upon the degree of attachment or traction between the vitreous and the retina, there may be risk of developing a macular hole in the other eye. In those cases where the vitreous has already become separated from the retinal surface, there is very little chance of developing a macular hole in the other eye. On the other hand, when the vitreous remains adherent and pulling on the macular region in both eyes, then there may be a greater risk of developing a hole in the second eye. In very rare instances, trauma or other conditions lead {{to the development of a}} macular hole. In the vast majority of cases, however, macular holes develop spontaneously. As a result, there is no known way to prevent their development through any nutritional or chemical means, nor is <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> know who is at risk for developing a hole prior to its appearance in one or both eyes.|$|E

The centre of our reflection is the aged and aging female body, which represented the absolute opposite to the existing renaissance discourse on feminine beauty. Confronted with the praise of an always admired youth, how did written and pictorial sources express the alteration due to feminine aging, and were <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> react to the effects of old age? Possible answers to these questions emerge through the analysis of images and texts facing the problem, as well as trough the study of the representation of the aging process itself, visible in images depicting a young woman at the mirror facing her aged reflection...|$|R
