Cuomo stated that, while the band liked the chosen band photo for the cover, Matt Sharp was not happy with <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>his</b> head looked. The Geffen Art Director used Photoshop to swap out the head with one from another shot.|$|E
5|$|Some of Garrison's staff {{begin to}} doubt his motives and {{disagree}} with his methods, {{and leave the}} investigation. Garrison's marriage is strained when his wife Liz (Sissy Spacek) complains that he is spending {{more time on the}} case than with his own family. After a sinister phone call is made to their daughter, Liz accuses Garrison of being selfish and attacking Shaw only because of his homosexuality. In addition, the media launches attacks on television and in newspapers attacking Garrison's character and criticizing <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>his</b> office is spending taxpayers' money. Some key witnesses become scared and refuse to testify while others, such as Ferrie, are killed in suspicious circumstances. Before his death, Ferrie tells Garrison that he believes people are after him, and reveals there was a conspiracy around Kennedy's death.|$|E
5|$|The divorce proved {{difficult}} for Jackson, who spent several weeks lamenting his loss. Presley {{was the first}} person with whom he had connected on such a high level. She had supported him as he faced allegations and became dependent on pain medication. It was also {{the first time that the}} pop singer had had a sexual chemistry with another. Presley was able to make him open up and express himself through their physically intimate moments together. At the time, Jackson was afraid there would never be another who made him feel <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>his</b> ex-wife had. He eventually realized he had to move on; he had a world tour coming up and music to work on. Jackson also knew that Presley would never make him a father, which he longed to be.|$|E

5|$|At this time, {{unhappy with}} <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>his</b> {{collection}} The Round Table, issued {{in the same}} year, was being promoted by its publisher, he began to promote his new book himself, partly {{by word of mouth}} and also by getting a friend to publish the chapter on Hamlet in The Times and requesting Francis Jeffrey, editor of the Edinburgh Review, to notice it in that periodical. He had already had it printed privately (instead of offering it directly to a publisher) by his friend the printer Carew Henry Reynell, who purchased the copyright for £100. As a publicity tactic, copies were circulated privately. Finally, Hazlitt got the book published, by Rowland Hunter and the brothers Charles and James Ollier in collaboration, who brought it out on 9 July 1817. It was extremely successful, this first edition selling out in six weeks. A second edition was issued by Taylor and Hessey in 1818, and later that year an unlicensed edition was brought out in Boston by Wells and Lilly. No further editions appeared in Hazlitt's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Edward II succeeded as king of England on 7 July 1307, on {{the death}} of his father Edward I. The {{expectations}} of the new king were high, and he initially enjoyed a good relationship with the leading magnates of the realm. There were, however, some issues of contention remaining from the reign of his father. Edward I's incessant wars had put a great fiscal burden on the country, and his confrontational style had led to conflict with some of the leading lay and ecclesiastical lords. This had culminated in the drafting of the so-called Remonstrances in 1297, a set of complaints about royal government. By Edward I's death in 1307, most of these issued had been resolved. It was nevertheless in the interest of the leading men of the country to make sure that the new king did not act <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>his</b> father had, and ignored the opinions of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|Ending {{his playing}} career, Bauer became coach, {{general manager and}} {{president}} of the Dutchmen in 1952. He coached the team to two OHA senior championships and Allan Cup victories: 1952–53 and 1954–55. As the top senior team in the nation, the Dutchmen were sent to Italy to represent Canada at the 1956 Winter Olympics. Bauer was pleased with <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>his</b> team adapted to European rules and the Dutchmen were expected to bring home the gold medal. However, the team was shocked by the American entry, a 4–1 loss. Though they still had a chance at gold due to the round robin format of the tournament, the Dutchmen were defeated by the Soviet Union – at the time a relatively unknown and emerging hockey power – by a 2–0 score despite outshooting the Soviets 23–9. Canada was relegated to the bronze medal, at the time the worst finish in the nation's Olympic hockey history.|$|E

5|$|Heureuse Réunion {{responded to}} the cannonade in kind. During the engagement, Gaspard {{repeatedly}} attempted to board Southampton, where his vastly superior numbers could overwhelm the British crew. Yeo was aware of his enemy's intentions, and repeatedly manoeuvered out of <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>his</b> more disciplined and agile vessel easily able to remain out of contact with the overloaded Haitian ship. Within half an hour the highly efficient gunners on Southampton had knocked down the main and mizen masts on Heureuse Réunion, leaving her unable to manoeuvre and vulnerable to repeated pounding at close range. Despite the severe damage the Haitian ship suffered, her crew continued to fire cannon at irregular intervals for 45 minutes, each shot prompting a broadside from the British ship. The two smaller Haitian vessels {{did not support the}} frigate, fleeing towards Maraguana near Petit Goâve to shelter under the batteries there. By 07:45, after over an hour of heavy fire, Yeo hailed Heureuse Réunion to discover whether or not she had surrendered. Somebody aboard replied that they had, although Gaspard had been seriously wounded and was no longer in command, so the identity of the person who gave the surrender is not known.|$|E
25|$|Although {{popular with}} many viewers, the {{character}} has garnered criticism, mainly regarding <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>his</b> anti-social behaviour is sensationalised by the programme makers.

25|$|He acted promptly. On {{the evening}} of 18 August, all the {{officers}} whom {{he thought he could}} trust received secret instructions to assemble in the great square facing the arsenal on the following morning. At ten o'clock on 19 August, Gustav mounted his horse and rode to the arsenal. On <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>his</b> adherents joined him in little groups, as if by accident, so that {{by the time he reached}} his destination he had about 200 officers in his suite.|$|E
25|$|Nivek Ogre as Pavi Largo, Rotti's middle child. Womanizing, narcissistic, vacuous, and effeminate, {{he wears}} the skinned {{face of a}} woman as a mask over his own, which is heavily scarred. Due to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>his</b> face is attached, {{he is able to}} change faces on a whim. He has an Italian accent (to conceal his speech impediment, {{according}} to Zdunich) and is almost always surrounded by women, usually Genterns, the employees of GeneCo, who usually give Pavi his face surgeries.|$|E

Once he goes to the past, however, he must not just resist accepting slavery as the normal state of affairs, but dissociate himself from the unrestricted power white males enjoy as their privilege.His prolonged stay in the past transforms him from a naive white man oblivious about racial issues into an anti-slave activist fighting racial oppression.|$|E

25|$|It is Nancy {{who first}} antagonizes him. Nancy's idea about living at {{different}} beaches {{for the rest}} of their lives is distasteful to him. He will not let her push him into even considering such a lifestyle. Nancy later tells him, much to his surprise, that she considered divorcing him a long time ago because she believed he was having an affair. Charlie tells her he did not have such a liaison, and she believes him. Charlie was happy with <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>his</b> life with Nancy was and still is.

25|$|He {{continued}} towards Aleppo, {{which still}} closed its gates to him, halting before the city. On <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>his</b> army took Buza'a, then captured Manbij. From there, they headed west to besiege the fortress of A'zaz on 15 May. Several days later, while Saladin was resting {{in one of}} his captain's tents, an assassin rushed forward at him and struck at his head with a knife. The cap of his head armour was not penetrated and he managed to grip the assassin's hand—the dagger only slashing his gambeson—and the assailant was soon killed. Saladin was unnerved at the attempt on his life, which he accused Gumushtugin and the Assassins of plotting, and so increased his efforts in the siege.|$|E
25|$|Named co-captain of the Badgers in {{his junior}} season of 2008–09, Geoffrion led his team in goals within the WCHA with 12 and {{tied for the}} lead overall at 15. His overall total of 28 points was fourth best on the team. Serving as a tri-captain, he led the WCHA in goal scoring in 2009-10 with 19 and was second in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) with 28. He reached the 50-goal plateau for his college career on March 13 and 100 points on February 19.

When she died, she instructed her children not to tell Phan so as to not distract him.|$|E
25|$|Inside Fort Caroline, La Vigne {{was keeping}} watch with his company, but taking pity on his sentinels, wet and {{fatigued}} {{with the heavy}} rain, he let them leave their stations with the approach of day, and finally he himself retired to his own quarters. With the break of day on September 20, the feast of St. Matthew, Menéndez was already alert. Before dawn he held a consultation with his captains, after which the entire party knelt down and prayed for a victory over their enemies. Then he {{set out for the}} fort over the narrow path which led to it from the woods. A French prisoner, Jean Francois, led <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>his</b> hands bound behind him, {{and the end of the}} rope held by Menéndez himself.|$|E
25|$|The {{regiment}} {{was equipped}} with M20 Scout Cars. In May 1944, Lieutenant Colonel André Demetz was appointed to command the regiment. He was a specialist in armoured warfare, whose philosophy was that <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>his</b> men treated their equipment (similarly to the way mounted cavalrymen treated their horse) showed their ability. He began the practice of naming all the vehicles of the regiment, after places in Paris; for example, the colonel's vehicle is named after Paris itself, the most prominent armoured vehicles are named after monuments such as the Louvre and Arc-de-Triomphe, and the regiment's trucks are named after working class banlieues like Pantin and Billancourt. The regiment embarked in Mers-el-Kebir and Oran on 25 August, and spent five days in the crossing to Provence, during which Colonel Schlesser radioed in an encouraging message.|$|E
