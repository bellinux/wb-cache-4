5|$|In 1910 Aurobindo withdrew {{himself from}} all {{political}} activities {{and went into}} hiding at Chandannagar {{in the house of}} Motilal Roy, while the British were trying to prosecute him for sedition {{on the basis of a}} signed article titled 'To My Countrymen', published in Karmayogin. As Aurobindo disappeared from view, <b>the</b> <b>warrant</b> was held back and the prosecution postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but <b>the</b> <b>warrant</b> could not be executed because on that date he had reached Pondicherry, then a French colony. <b>The</b> <b>warrant</b> against Aurobindo was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|In 1925, {{the rank}} of KCMG was conferred on him, <b>the</b> <b>warrant</b> having been signed by his friend The Earl Buxton, Chancellor of the Order, who had served as Governor-General of South Africa from 1914 to 1920 and was {{president}} of the African Society from 1920 to 1933.|$|E
5|$|Justice Souter joined Breyer's {{opinion in}} all respects but wrote {{separately}} to condition his support {{on the belief that}} the search was appropriate only because of the immediate danger that the evidence could have been destroyed.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} Harrod's fiscal {{policies}} to raise <b>the</b> <b>warranted</b> growth rate toward the natural growth rate. Harrod shows that {{an increase in}} the budget deficit/GDP ratio raises the short-run growth rate while lowering <b>the</b> <b>warranted</b> growth rate. In order to raise <b>the</b> <b>warranted</b> growth rate Harrod recommends higher tax rates and an increase in public investment. However, given Harrod's own framework these are not unproblematic proposals. This paper resolves some ambiguities in Harrod's analysis and shows how taxation policy, either singly or in combination with a public investment strategy, can raise <b>the</b> <b>warranted</b> growth rate. Following Keynes and others it suggests the relevance of capital budgeting and shows how <b>the</b> <b>warranted</b> growth can be raised via appropriate capital budgeting policies. capacity utilization, capital budgeting, fiscal policy, Harrod, Keynes, public investment, taxation policy, warranted growth rate,...|$|R
5|$|One {{day after}} the release of The Wall Street Journals investigation, it was {{reported}} that <b>the</b> <b>warrant</b> issued after Hsu's failure to appear for sentencing for his 1992 fraud conviction was still valid.

5|$|At {{the close}} of the war, having drawn no part of his salary, and from his great skill as a surgeon having endeared himself to the Virginians, in {{settling}} up his accounts he was presented with a land warrant, to be located in lands selected in Kentucky, leaving a blank within <b>the</b> <b>warrant</b> for the number of acres to filled by Dr Hinde himself. The blank was filled with twenty thousand, and placed in the hands of Patrick Henry to select and locate the lands.|$|E
5|$|George Loney {{formed a}} posse {{consisting}} of himself, Constable Cliff Martin, Claude Littrell and Oscar Lane, after a steer {{was stolen from}} Littrell's property in Paden on May 1. Littrell obtained a search warrant from A.W. Jenkins, a Justice of the Peace, which allowed the men to search the Nelson's farm. They arrived there on May 2 at around 9 pm, and read <b>the</b> <b>warrant</b> to Austin Nelson before entering the house. The steer's remains were found either in the barn or the house.|$|E
40|$|The type {{of firms}} issuing {{warrants}} {{has changed over}} the last 20 years. In <b>the</b> 1990 s, <b>warrants</b> were primarily issued by firms as part of their IPOs. By 2001, firms emerging from chapter 11 bankruptcy issued <b>the</b> majority of <b>warrants.</b> <b>The</b> contract characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>warrants</b> issued in <b>the</b> two situations are different. Warrants issued during chapter 11 have a longer time until expiration, lower dilution levels, higher exercise price to initial price ratio, and are less likely to have provisions that allow managerial control over <b>the</b> <b>warrants.</b> <b>The</b> differences arise from different motivations for <b>the</b> issuance of <b>warrants.</b> </p...|$|R
50|$|Moreno Ocampo {{applied to}} Pre-Trial Chamber II for {{warrants}} of arrest for Kony, Lukwiya, Odhiambo, Ongwen and Otti on 6 May 2005 and <b>the</b> <b>warrants</b> for all five men were issued under seal on 8 July of that year. <b>The</b> <b>warrants</b> were unsealed on 13 October 2005.|$|R

Attorney General Edwin Meese called his Italian counterpart Mino Martinazzoli informing him of <b>the</b> arrest <b>warrants.</b> <b>The</b> FBI notified Italian law enforcement agencies of <b>the</b> <b>warrants.</b> Maxwell Rabb, U.S. Ambassador to Italy delivered <b>the</b> <b>warrants</b> to Salvatore Zhara Buda at the Italian Ministry of Justice at his home at 5:30a.m. Saturday morning October 12.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Kansas Anderson {{continued}} horse trafficking, but ranchers in the area soon became aware of his operations. In May 1862 Baker issued an arrest warrant for Griffith, whom Anderson helped hide. Some local citizens suspected that the Anderson family was assisting Griffith and traveled to their house to confront William C. Anderson. After hearing their accusations against his sons, he was incensed—he found Baker's involvement particularly infuriating. The next day he traveled to the Council Grove courthouse with a gun, intending to force Baker to withdraw <b>the</b> <b>warrant.</b> As he entered the building he was restrained by a constable and fatally shot by Baker. William Anderson buried his father, and was subsequently arrested for assisting Griffith. However, he was quickly released owing to a problem with <b>the</b> <b>warrant,</b> and fled to Agnes City, fearing {{that he would be}} lynched. There he met Baker, who temporarily placated him by providing a lawyer. Anderson remained in Agnes City until he learned that Baker would not be charged, as the judge's claim of self-defense had been accepted by legal authorities. Anderson was outraged and went to Missouri with his siblings. William and Jim Anderson then traveled southwest of Kansas City, robbing travelers to support themselves.|$|E
5|$|When {{the news}} of the {{execution}} reached Elizabeth, she became indignant and asserted that Davison had disobeyed her instructions not to part with <b>the</b> <b>warrant</b> and that the Privy Council had acted without her authority. Elizabeth's vacillation and deliberately vague instructions gave her plausible deniability, to attempt to avoid the direct stain of Mary's blood. Davison was arrested, thrown into the Tower of London, and found guilty of misprision. He was released 19 months later after Cecil and Walsingham interceded on his behalf.|$|E
5|$|On November 8, 2004, Fletcher {{signed a}} death warrant for Thomas Clyde Bowling, {{who was convicted}} of a double murder in 1990 and sentenced to death by lethal injection. A group of doctors {{requested}} an investigation by the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure to determine whether Fletcher's medical license should be revoked for that action. Kentucky requires doctors to follow the guidelines of the American Medical Association, which forbid doctors from participating in an execution. On January 13, 2005, the Board of Medical Licensure found that Fletcher was acting in his capacity as governor, not as a doctor, when he signed <b>the</b> <b>warrant</b> and ruled that his license was not subject to forfeiture by that action.|$|E

40|$|I examine <b>the</b> <b>warrants</b> we have {{in light}} of the {{empirical}} successes of a kind of model I call ‘hybrid models’, a kind that includes climate models among its members. I argue that these warrants’ strengths depend on inferential virtues that are not just explanatory virtues, contrary to what would be the case if inference to the best explanation (IBE) provided <b>the</b> <b>warrants.</b> I also argue that <b>the</b> <b>warrants</b> in question, unlike those IBE provides, guide inferences only to model implications about which there is real uncertainty. My conclusion provides criteria of adequacy for epistemologies of climate and other hybrid models...|$|R
50|$|On 9 March 2011, Robert Tchenguiz and his brother, Vincent Tchenguiz, {{were arrested}} in London by the UK's Serious Fraud Office {{as part of their}} ongoing {{investigation}} in conjunction with Iceland's Special Prosecutor’s Office into the collapse of Icelandic Bank Kaupthing. However, on 22 December 2011 the SFO and the Treasury Solicitors Department (TSoI) admitted factual errors in the information used to obtain <b>the</b> <b>warrants</b> against Consensus Business Group and Vincent Tchenguiz; stated that <b>the</b> <b>warrants</b> should be quashed; and that material seized under <b>the</b> <b>warrants</b> would be returned that day.

5|$|Two {{months into}} his term, Dow {{inadvertently}} ran afoul {{of his own}} prohibition laws. After setting up a committee to dispense alcohol for medicinal and industrial use (the only uses permitted), Dow ordered $1600 worth of alcohol and stored it at City Hall. Dow neglected to appoint an official agent to hold it there; because the invoice was in his name, this placed Dow in technical violation of the law. Dow's enemies seized on the mistake and demanded that the police search the municipal building for illegal liquor. Because the recent additions to the Maine law had removed judicial discretion, the judge {{had no choice but}} to issue <b>the</b> <b>warrant.</b> Police seized the alcohol, but did not arrest Dow.|$|E
5|$|Until 1907, it was policy not {{to award}} the VC posthumously. Between 1857 and 1901, nine notices were {{published}} in the London Gazette for soldiers who would have been awarded the VC had they survived. In a partial reversal of policy in 1902, medals were sent to the next of kin of the three mentioned for the Boer War {{and at the same time}} the first three official posthumous awards, again for the Boer War, were gazetted. In 1907, the posthumous policy was completely reversed and medals were sent to the next of kin of the remaining six officers and men. As a result of the change of policy, one quarter of all awards for the First World War were posthumous but it was only in the general revision of <b>the</b> <b>warrant</b> issued in 1920 that a clause was inserted to explicitly allow posthumous awards.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the events}} of September 11, Bush issued an {{executive}} order authorizing the President's Surveillance Program which included allowing the NSA to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant {{as required by the}} Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. As of 2009, the other provisions of the program remained highly classified. Once the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that <b>the</b> <b>warrant</b> requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists. The program proved to be controversial, as critics of the administration, as well as organizations such as the American Bar Association, argued that it was illegal. In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the NSA electronic surveillance program was unconstitutional, but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was vacated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit {{on the grounds that the}} plaintiffs lacked standing. On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight. Later in 2007, the NSA launched a replacement for the program, referred to as PRISM, that was subject to the oversight of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. This program was not publicly revealed until reports by The Washington Post and The Guardian emerged in June 2013.|$|E
