Accommodation areas were crowded, with each man having only [...] of space <b>to</b> <b>sling</b> his hammock when Australia was fully manned. Moreover, the ventilation system was designed for conditions in Europe, and was inadequate for the climate in and around Australia.

500|$|Peart's {{drumming}} {{skill and}} technique are well-regarded by fans, fellow musicians, and music journalists. His influences are eclectic, ranging from Pete Thomas, John Bonham, Michael Giles, Ginger Baker, Phil Collins, Steve Gadd, Stewart Copeland, Michael Shrieve and Keith Moon, to fusion and jazz drummers Billy Cobham, Buddy Rich, Bill Bruford and Gene Krupa. The Who {{was the first}} group that inspired him to write songs and play the drums. Peart is distinguished for playing [...] "butt-end out", reversing stick orientation for greater impact and increased rimshot capacity. [...] "When I was starting out", Peart said, [...] "if I broke the tips off my sticks I couldn't afford to buy new ones, so I would just turn them around and use the other end. I got used to it, and continue to use the heavy end of lighter sticks – {{it gives me a}} solid impact, but with less 'dead weight' <b>to</b> <b>sling</b> around." ...|$|E

500|$|Bart {{sees himself}} as King David, who kills Goliath, but has not won the war yet: Nelson is Goliath II, Goliath's son. Goliath II has killed Methuselah (Grampa), David's oldest friend in revenge. In retaliation, David {{challenges}} Goliath II, but having no stones <b>to</b> <b>sling</b> at him, David loses and is catapulted from the city. David then meets Ralph, a shepherd, who claims he can kill Goliath II. Ralph dies, which enrages David even more. He then trains to try to slay Goliath. Having to climb up the enormous Tower of Babel beforehand, David manages to kill Goliath by throwing a lit lantern down his throat. Goliath is surprisingly still alive, but is quickly killed by Ralph's gravestone, hurled by Ralph himself, who also had not died. Much to his shock, David is sent to jail as the townspeople claim that Goliath was the best King they ever had, building roads, libraries and hospitals. The dream ends with a title card that reads [...] "A Bart Simpson Dream".|$|E

2500|$|Young led his brigade into Germany {{after the}} {{cessation}} of hostilities, where they undertook garrison duties {{as part of the}} Allied army of occupation. Then as the NZEF began to draw down he was posted <b>to</b> <b>Sling</b> Camp in England on 10 April 1919, in command of a group of soldiers awaiting their return voyage to New Zealand. Unfortunately, delays in obtaining transports for the return home resulted in considerable impatience and culminated in a camp riot. Young, who was held in great respect by the New Zealand soldiers, was called on to sort the matter out and his arrangements to ensure that married men were returned before single men helped alleviate the situation.|$|E

2500|$|Marching {{percussion}} {{instruments are}} specially {{designed to be}} played while moving. This is achieved by attaching the drum(s) to a special harness (also called a carrier or rack) worn by the drummer, although not all marching bands use such harnesses and instead use traditional baldrics <b>to</b> <b>sling</b> their drums (the British Armed Forces, for instance, still use the old style of slung drums). The drums are designed and tuned for maximum articulation and projection of sound, as marching activities are almost always outdoors or in large interior spaces. Articulation is paramount to producing a [...] "clean" [...] sound from all the drummers in the line. These instruments are used by marching bands, drum and bugle corps, indoor percussion ensembles, and pipe bands. A marching percussion ensemble is frequently known as a drumline or battery.|$|E

50|$|Drum hoists {{require less}} routine {{maintenance}} than a friction hoist, because the haulage cable is {{fixed to the}} drum, and therefore have less downtime, and the maintenance regime is less sophisticated. Drum hoists can continue to operate if the shaft bottom gets flooded and less shaft depth is required below the loading pocket, unlike friction hoists where such flooding could cover the tail ropes and so on. Because drum hoists do not have tail ropes, the hoisting system is more suited <b>to</b> <b>slinging</b> beneath a conveyance.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Complications of {{polypropylene}} pubovaginal tension-free tape slings (TVT, SPARC, and others), such as erosion into the bladder or chronic pain attributed <b>to</b> the mesh <b>sling</b> are rare events; however, when they occur, it may necessitate {{removal of the}} <b>sling.</b> <b>To</b> date, removal through a laparotomy incision or by operative cystoscopy {{has been the most}} common approach. We present 5 cases of a laparoscopic approach for removal {{of polypropylene}} pubovaginal tension-free tape slings. Methods: We report 5 cases of laparoscopic removal of TVT mesh. Three were removed for mesh erosion into the bladder, and 2 were removed secondary to the patients having persistent pain and discomfort attributed <b>to</b> the <b>sling.</b> An intraperitoneal approach was used to enter the retropubic space <b>to</b> remove the <b>sling.</b> Dissection was completed with a Harmonic scalpel blade as well as blunt dissection to identify the mesh sling retropubically. Average operating time was 104 minutes. Average blood loss was 70 mL. Average hospital stay was � 23 hours. Postoperative courses were uneventful; however, 4 of the 5 patients continue to have urgency and frequency symptoms following sling removal. Conclusion: These cases illustrate the use of laparoscopy in the removal of polypropylene pubovaginal tension-free tape slings for bladder erosion or persistent pain, or both, attributed <b>to</b> the <b>sling.</b> Erosion and pain are known complications of polypropylene pubovaginal slings and may cause significant morbidity like persistent detrusor instability or urge incontinence, or both. Patients must be informed of these risks and possible complications before making their decision to undergo surgery...|$|R
