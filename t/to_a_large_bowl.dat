2500|$|In 1696, Jonathan Dickinson {{witnessed}} {{the use of}} a beverage brewed from the Yaupon Holly among the Ais of Florida. Dickinson later learned that the Spanish called the plant casseena. The Ais parched the leaves in a pot, and then boiled them. The resulting liquid was then transferred <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> using a gourd that had a long neck with a small hole at the top, and a [...] hole in the side. On the occasion Dickinson witnessed, he estimated that there were nearly three gallons of the beverage in the bowl. After the liquid had cooled, the chief was presented with a conch-shell of the beverage. The chief threw part of it on the ground as a blessing and drank the rest. The chief's associates were then served in turn. Lower status men, women, and children were not allowed to touch or taste the beverage. The chief and his associates sat drinking this brew, smoking and talking for most of the day. In the evening, the bowl that had held the beverage was covered with a skin to make a drum. The Ais, accompanied by the drum and some rattles, sang and danced until the middle of the night.|$|E
25|$|Bowling alleys built {{during this}} period often {{featured}} restaurants or nightclubs where locally or even nationally prominent entertainers would perform. In the 1948 movie Road House, the title refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowling</b> alley with <b>a</b> nightclub attached, {{where much of the}} action takes place. The film provides a good historical glance at bowling alleys of the era.|$|R

50|$|The National Bowling Stadium is a 363000 sq ft {{ten-pin bowling}} stadium in Reno, Nevada. The stadium is {{recognizable}} for an 80 ft aluminum geodesic dome in its facade, built <b>to</b> resemble <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowling</b> ball.|$|R
50|$|By September 2008 the old theatre {{at the end}} of {{the pier}} had been {{converted}} <b>to</b> become <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowling</b> alley and bars. The original steel and ironwork has been restored and returned to the new building. The 100-year-old original girders are now visible, having been originally hidden in the theatre roof space. The newer building is so similar to the (demolished) old theatre that many visitors do not realise it is a new building. The ten-lane full-size bowling alley takes up most of the space in what was the old auditorium and stage space. A 80-foot-long stained-glass picture was found during the removal of the original Wellington pier theatre structure; it has been restored and will be the centrepiece of the entrance to the new complex. It depicts ships sailing into the port of Great Yarmouth.|$|R
5000|$|Ali, God has {{commanded}} me to warn my {{tribe of}} near kindred. I {{was troubled by}} this, since I knew that when I discuss the matter to them they would respond {{in a way which}} I would not like. I kept silent until Gabriel {{came to me and said}} [...] "If you do not do what you are commanded, your Lord will punish you." [...] So prepare a measure of wheat for us, add a leg of lamb <b>to</b> it, fill <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> of milk for us, and then invite sons of Abd al-Muttalib for me so that I may speak to them what I have been commanded to tell them.|$|R
5000|$|Niels is an anchor-man at the TV channel [...] "Jump Start" [...] {{and from}} season 2 and onwards the CEO of the station. Niels {{has worked as}} a foreign {{correspondent}} throughout his seemingly long career and often regales in absurd stories from his experiences. He is a blatant pervert with many sexual fetishes, including some illegal ones such as paedophilia and necrophilia. Additionally, he also has various extreme or elaborate fetishes which he often hints at in a rather obvious language. He is also very outspoken about non-sexual intimacies, such as bowel-movements (in one episode he ceremoniously informs the staff that he has diarrhea and then confines himself to his office, ordering Robert <b>to</b> fetch him <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> and some old newspapers, his preferred brand of toiletpaper etc.). Niels continuously finds himself in embarrassing situations but sometimes fails to see the problem. At other times he is quite vain.|$|R
50|$|Fortress Test: The players {{drove out}} <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{isolated}} homestead {{in the countryside}} and told to fortify it in <b>an</b> attempt <b>to</b> protect <b>a</b> <b>large</b> glass <b>bowl</b> full of water. They were {{told a group of}} attackers would come sometime that night and try to destroy the bowl. If they could protect it until 2:00 AM the next morning, they'd win $10,000. They were given tools to fortify the doors and windows of the homestead, paintball guns to tag and eliminate their attackers, bodily protective gear, night vision goggles, radios, a searchlight, and the help of a professional armourer. They were not told how many attackers they would face. Brooke patrolled the front of the homestead, with Michael in the rear, Mal the last line of defence in front of the bowl itself, and Hal, Shane, and Emily as snipers in the home's second storey. After a couple of bluffs earlier in the evening, the attackers struck for real at midnight, and broke in through the rear of the house, easily overwhelming Mal on the inside and destroying the bowl. They had planted time-delay flash bombs out front, which drew the players' attention to the wrong area.|$|R
60|$|Passing onwards {{we entered}} a {{continuation}} of the Wady Harirah. It is a long valley choked with dense vegetation, through which meandered a line of water brightly gilt by the sun's rays: my Somal remarked that were the elephants now infesting it destroyed, rice, the favourite luxury, might be grown upon its banks in abundance. Our road lay under clumps of shady trees, over rocky watercourses, through avenues of tall cactus, and down tranchees worn by man eight and ten feet below stiff banks of rich red clay. On every side appeared deep clefts, ravines, and earth cracks, all, at this season, dry. The unarmed cultivators thronged from the frequent settlements to stare, and my Somal, being no longer in their own country, laid aside for guns their ridiculous spears. On the way passing Ao Samattar's village, the worthy fellow made us halt whilst he went <b>to</b> fetch <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> of sour milk. About noon the fresh western breeze obscured the fierce sun with clouds, and we watered our mules in a mountain stream which crossed our path thrice within as many hundred yards. After six miles' ride reaching the valley's head, we began the descent of a rugged pass by a rough and rocky path. The scenery around us was remarkable. The hill sides were well wooded, and black with pine: their summits were bared of earth by the heavy monsoon which spreads the valleys with rich soil; in many places the beds of waterfalls shone like sheets of metal upon the black rock; villages surrounded by fields and fences studded the country, and the distance was a mass of purple peak and blue table in long vanishing succession. Ascending the valley's opposite wall, we found the remains of primaeval forests,--little glades which had escaped the axe,-- they resounded with the cries of pintados and cynocephali. [22] Had the yellow crops of Holcus been wheat, I might have fancied myself once more riding in the pleasant neighbourhood of Tuscan Sienna.|$|R

5000|$|When the Blackhawk stopped {{featuring}} orchestras in 1952 {{and removed}} the bandstand and the dance floor, Don Roth declared the restaurant's theme was [...] "The Food's the Show" [...] {{and focused on the}} house specialty of prime rib served from carts brought to the tables and its [...] "spinning salad bowl." [...] Waiters would bring <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> of greens set into <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>bowl</b> of ice. <b>As</b> they spun it, the waiters would add ingredients and describe what they were doing to the diners. Roth borrowed these concepts from Lawry's in Beverly Hills, California.|$|R

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of the fourth day, Talking God and Water Sprinkler {{appeared}} with <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> of white shell and <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>bowl</b> of blue shell.
