500|$|Davies had {{suspected}} that Renwick {{would one day}} revive Jonathan Creek, explaining that Jonathan's fate had been left open, unlike Renwick's other famous character - One Foot In The Graves Victor Meldrew, {{who was killed in}} a hit and run in the show's last episode. When the production of [...] "The Grinning Man" [...] was announced in June 2008, Davies commented: [...] "For the last five years whenever I've passed a locked room I've thought there might be a mystery lurking behind it, so I'm very happy to return to Jonathan Creek and to have something to actually solve." [...] He stated that reprising the role after such a lengthy hiatus was initially strange, and that: [...] "I couldn't remember my lines on the first day. I'd sort of forgotten how precise you have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> work on a Jonathan Creek episode." [...] He praised co-star Sheridan Smith in comparison, describing how: [...] "Sheridan is extremely good at all that stuff, which works in a similar way to the script, in that she's a very bright, sharp character and Creek's a bit rusty and hasn't really been doing it for a while. So sure enough, on the first day, she knows all her lines and makes her mark. And I'm going, 'Hang on a minute, stop showing off'". Upon receiving the episode's script, Davies had gained a stone in weight since last playing Jonathan Creek, almost five years previously. Renwick suggested that they include Davies' weight gain in the plot, presenting the character as having [...] "gone to seed". Davies, however, did not want to play a [...] "fat Creek", and lost weight before filming began, stating: [...] "it was my choice not to let him go too much". The actor discussed with Renwick how Jonathan may have developed in the intervening five years: [...] "We talked about whether he’d have changed, whether he’d have done any investigating in the meantime. He probably didn’t. He still does the same job and is locked in the same relationship with Klaus and feeling a bit put upon – that hasn’t changed at all... and he still lives in a windmill". In a change from the original, Cobstone Windmill was used for the exterior shots, replacing Shipley Windmill, which had been used for all other episodes. Davies grew his hair out again for the role, and wore his own duffel coat throughout the episode. The coat had become the character's trademark in the show's first series, with Davies explaining that: [...] "After we did the first series, I could never wear it off screen again, because people started doing the Danse Macabre [...] music everywhere I went. So it's just been in the wardrobe for 12 years." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 2004 Christmas issue {{received}} {{a number of}} complaints after it featured Pieter Bruegel's painting of a nativity scene, in which one wise man said to another: [...] "Apparently, it's David Blunkett's" [...] (who {{at the time was}} involved in a scandal in which he was thought to have impregnated a married woman). Many readers sent letters accusing the magazine of blasphemy and anti-Christian attitudes. One stated that the [...] "witless, gutless buggers wouldn't dare mock Islam". It has, however, regularly published Islam-related humour such as the cartoon which portrayed a [...] "Taliban careers master asking a pupil: What would you like <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> blow up?".|$|E

He wrote: [...] "The funny bit is Matt Groening's introduction, from there is falls {{away to the}} kind of humour written on the walls of {{bathrooms}} and the backs of copy books in primary school. It seems to be pitched in-between audiences— too adult for children, too childish for adults. Page after page of annoyingly laid out poorly written prose recommending everything from cool things <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> grow up to questioning whether or not they have secret sauce in Heaven. This attempt to portray the Simpsons characters indicates both that they do not translate well to print and that whoever contributed to this book was not a writer on the show." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} to be found out," [...] the Marquis went on, a little wearily. [...] "Your country life has dulled your wits, Baron. The title and the name are justly yours--they go with the property. For the rest, the history of your family, and of your career up to the moment when you enter Porchester House to-night, will be inside this packet. You can peruse it upon the journey, and {{remember}} that we can, at all times, bring a hundred witnesses, if necessary, to prove that you are who you declare yourself <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> get to Charing-Cross, do not forget that it will be the carriage and servants of the Baron de Grost which await you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They went on {{to speak}} of the trip to New York, and how much easier it was then than it used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> had to go by stage over the {{mountains}} to Philadelphia and on by stage again. Now, it seemed, you got the Erie Canal packet at Buffalo and the Hudson River steamboat at Albany, and reached New York in four or five days, in great comfort without the least fatigue. They had all risen and my aunt had gone out with her sisters-in-law to help them get their wraps. When they returned, it seemed that they had been talking of the journey, too, for she said to my mother, laughing again, 'Well, Richard may think it's easy; but somehow Felix never expects to get home alive.' ...|$|E

It's an affair of trade, I suppose, and you're {{at the head of}} all that now." [...] Then again she asked him some {{question}} about the Home Secretary, with reference to Phineas Finn; and when he told her that it would be highly improper for him to speak to that officer on such a subject, she pretended to suppose that the impropriety would consist in the interference of a man holding so low a position as he was. [...] "Of course it is not the same now," [...] she said, [...] "as it used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> were at the Exchequer." [...] All which he took without uttering a word of anger, or showing a sign of annoyance. [...] "You only get two thousand a year, do you, at the Board of Trade, Plantagenet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{then she}} is handsome, peculiarly handsome. Hers is a beauty that grows on you. You think her but graceful <b>when</b> <b>you</b> first see her; you {{discover}} her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> beautiful <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have known {{her for a}} year." ...|$|R
50|$|Technically, CMOV is {{optional}} in the i686 architecture. But Intel's i686 product, the Pentium Pro, had it, and consequently things that generate code typically consider CMOV <b>to</b> <b>be</b> available <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{ask them to}} generate code for i686.|$|R
60|$|That, apparently, was {{the best}} that Giovio could think of. It is hardly intelligible--which is perhaps inevitable, for it <b>is</b> not easy <b>to</b> <b>be</b> intelligible <b>when</b> <b>you</b> don't quite know, yourself, what you mean, which must have been Giovio's case.|$|R
