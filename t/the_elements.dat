Discord continues to taunt Twilight, {{but she is}} determined {{to get back to}} the library in town to find a way to defeat Discord while her best friends' personalities continue to become more warped, losing even more of their color until they are completely monochrome. Managing to get them all into the library, Twilight and Spike locate the book about <b>the</b> <b>Elements</b> of Harmony and after a brief scuffle with the other ponies over the book, are surprised and delighted to find the book actually contains <b>the</b> <b>Elements.</b> She forces her best friends to wear <b>the</b> <b>Elements,</b> though they are more willing to help after she angrily states that the sooner they defeat Discord, the sooner they never have to see each other again; Twilight also assigns Spike as the temporary Element of Loyalty because Rainbow Dash is not present. They go to face Discord, but <b>the</b> <b>Elements</b> fail to activate. The other four ponies and Spike quickly drop <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> and depart, leaving Twilight despondent and finally losing her own color.|$|E
5|$|In {{his report}} on The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements, in 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev had implicitly {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} a heavier analog of titanium and zirconium. At the time of his formulation in 1871, Mendeleev believed that <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> were ordered by their atomic masses and placed lanthanum (element 57) in the spot below zirconium. The exact placement of <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> and the location of missing elements was done by determining the specific weight of <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> and comparing the chemical and physical properties.|$|E

5|$|In the {{standard}} periodic table, <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> {{are listed in}} order of increasing atomic number Z (the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom). A new row (period) is started when a new electron shell has its first electron. Columns (groups) {{are determined by the}} electron configuration of the atom; elements with the same number of electrons in a particular subshell fall into the same columns (e.g. oxygen and selenium are in the same column because they both have four electrons in the outermost p-subshell). Elements with similar chemical properties generally fall into the same group in the periodic table, although in the f-block, and to some respect in the d-block, <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> in the same period tend to have similar properties, as well. Thus, it is relatively easy to predict the chemical properties of an element if one knows the properties of <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> around it.|$|E

5|$|Placing <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> into {{categories}} and subcategories based on shared properties is imperfect. There is {{a spectrum of}} properties within each category {{and it is not}} hard to find overlaps at the boundaries, as is the case with most classification schemes. Beryllium, for example, is classified as an alkaline earth metal although its amphoteric chemistry and tendency to mostly form covalent compounds are both attributes of a chemically weak or post-transition metal. Radon is classified as a nonmetal and a noble gas yet has some cationic chemistry that is more characteristic of a metal. Other classification schemes are possible such as the division of <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> into mineralogical occurrence categories, or crystalline structures. Categorizing <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> in this fashion dates back to at least 1869 when Hinrichs wrote that simple boundary lines could be drawn on the periodic table to show elements having like properties, such as the metals and the nonmetals, or the gaseous elements.|$|E

5|$|Russian {{chemistry}} professor Dmitri Mendeleev and German chemist Julius Lothar Meyer independently published their periodic {{tables in}} 1869 and 1870, respectively. Mendeleev's table {{was his first}} published version; that of Meyer was an expanded version of his (Meyer's) table of 1864. They both constructed their tables by listing <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> in rows or columns in order of atomic weight and starting a new row or column when the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> began to repeat.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{properties}} of an element are mostly determined by its electron configuration, {{the properties}} of <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> likewise show recurring patterns or periodic behaviour, some examples of which are shown in the diagrams below for atomic radii, ionization energy and electron affinity. It is this periodicity of properties, manifestations of which were noticed well before the underlying theory was developed, {{that led to the}} establishment of the periodic law ({{the properties of}} <b>the</b> <b>elements</b> recur at varying intervals) and the formulation of the first periodic tables.|$|E

40|$|An assumed-stress hybrid/mixed 4 -node {{quadrilateral}} {{shell element}} is introduced that alleviates {{most of the}} deficiencies associated with such <b>elements.</b> <b>The</b> formulation of <b>the</b> <b>element</b> {{is based on the}} assumed-stress hybrid/mixed method using the Hellinger-Reissner variational principle. The membrane part of <b>the</b> <b>element</b> has 12 degrees of freedom including rotational or drilling degrees of freedom at the nodes. The bending part of <b>the</b> <b>element</b> also has 12 degrees of freedom. The bending part of <b>the</b> <b>element</b> uses <b>the</b> Reissner-Mindlin plate theory which takes into account the transverse shear contributions. <b>The</b> <b>element</b> formulation is derived from an 8 -node isoparametric element. This process is accomplished by assuming quadratic variations for both in-plane and out-of-plane displacement fields and linear variations for both in-plane and out-of-plane rotation fields along the edges of <b>the</b> <b>element.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> degrees of freedom at midside nodes are approximated in terms of the degrees of freedom at corner nodes.
