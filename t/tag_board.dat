50|$|Following the {{cessation}} of its railway operation in 1998, {{as a result of}} the concession being given to a competitor, the business of the TAG AG became limited to the maintenance and rental of property and land that belonged to the railway (trackage, stations at Gmund and Tegernsee) as well as land no longer needed for railway operations and the cash assets. An investors group including investor, Rolf Hauschildt, and property manager, Lutz Ristow, initially took over a share and posts on the board of directors; later Ristow was also the Vorstandsmandat for a short time. The firm was reorganised into a property and holding company, and was renamed in 1999 to TAG Tegernsee Immobilien und Beteiligungs-AG. In January 2001, as part of its expansion into property, the TAG bought 75% of the non-public Berliner JUS AG, which had specialised in refurbishing and modernising property under historical protection orders. Its manager, Michael Haupt, joined the <b>TAG's</b> <b>board.</b> Its share was increased in 2002 to 94%. In June 2001, 44% of the public Bau-Verein zu Hamburg AG was bought; through a swap action and further purchase its share rose in early 2002 to 88%, but fell again afterwards to today's 69%. Likewise, in 2001 the non-public project development and preservation company AGP AG Munich was taken over. In November 2002, the Real Immobilien GmbH was founded, together with a subsidiary, Sachsen LB, into which properties in need of repair were bundled.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{overview}} {{is given}} {{of two new}} developments in mine atmospheric monitoring. A new personal dust monitor (PDM) that gives realtime respirable dust readings is discussed. The unit is mounted within the miner’s cap lamp battery and internally measures the true particle mass of dust collected on its filter. Samples are available for later mineralogical analysis and results do not exhibit the same sensitivity to water spray as optically based measurement approaches. The technique achieves microgram-level mass resolution even in the hostile mine environment and reports dust loading data on a continuous basis. The monitor has been evaluated under an Australian Coal Association Research Program (ACARP) grant and is being adopted for statutory mine respirable dust determinations in the US. It has particular application for determining high source locations and efficiency of engineering means of suppression and other approaches to handling the problem. It has been recognised that the PDM’s unique measurement approach has application to allow real time atmospheric Diesel Particulate Matter (DPM) monitoring. The industry has no real time atmospheric DPM monitor at present. Recent surveys in New South Wales and Queensland continue to show significant numbers of miners continue to face full shift DPM exposures in excess of internationally accepted levels. Real time DPM monitoring will allow the industry to pin-point high exposure zones where a number of trucks and other vehicles work or in areas of poor ventilation. Pinpointing of high DPM concentration zones will allow efficient modification of work practices to reduce underground miners exposure. Approaches to design of <b>Tag</b> <b>Boards</b> are also discussed. Some outcomes from mine tests with both these new instruments are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Thirteen adult blueﬁn tuna were tracked with elec- tronic pop-up {{satellite}} tags {{during their}} reproductive migration towards Mediterranean spawning grounds {{as they entered}} the Strait of Gibraltar. Fish were caught in tuna traps and tagged either underwater, {{with the aid of a}} modiﬁed spear gun, or on the deck of the boat. Fish <b>tagged</b> on <b>board</b> initially showed a shallower behavior than those tagged in the water. The pattern of horizontal movements was also different between both groups. Shortly after tagging, the eight ﬁsh tagged in the water entered the Mediterranean Sea. Six of these ﬁsh reached the spawning ground located south- west of the Balearic archipelago before headin g back for the Atlantic, whereas the other two traveled far- ther east, reaching its easternmost longitudes between Formentera and Sardinia and the South Tyrrhenian Sea, respectively. In contrast, two out of the ﬁve ﬁsh <b>tagged</b> on <b>board</b> never entered the Mediterranean Sea, and another one did enter the Medi terranean when the reproductive season was already over. These results suggest an impact of the tagging procedure on the post-release behavior of blueﬁn tuna. Exclu ding the tags that popped-off east of the Strait of Gibra ltar, blueﬁn tuna stayed in the Mediterranean Sea for 22 – 28 days. Analysis of the median depth indicated a shallow behavior during both day and nighttime throughout the return phase of the ﬁsh from the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean with the exception of the area around the Strait of Gibraltar, where they showed a deeper behavior that coincided with a marked vertical gradient in the currents.

40|$|Spider silk {{proteins}} can {{be created}} synthetically and are highly valued for their strength, durability, and flexibility. By altering the genome of goats, silk worms, and the bacteria E. coli {{we are able to}} manufacture spider silk products in lab. The production and manipulation of these ‘recombinant spider silk proteins’ along with the process of aqueous solubilization can yield many useful spider silk materials such as films, fibers, gels, coatings, and more. Conductive ink is a recent and popular scientific discovery that let’s you create flexible working circuits. This product has many applications including RFID <b>tags,</b> circuit <b>boards,</b> and printers. However, most conductive inks contain a highly toxic organic compound known as butanone along with a conductive salt. Our research is to prove that replacing butanone with spider silk proteins in conductive inks will still create a flexible and durable circuit without the toxicity. This non-toxic conductive ink could prove useful when applying the circuit directly into living systems. We also think that using spider silk proteins in our circuits will improve the durability and elasticity of the circuits created...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the movements of}} Atlantic tuna (Thunnus thynnus L.) in the Mediterranean Sea using data from 2 archival tags and 37 pop-up satellite archival tags (PAT). Bluefin tuna {{ranging in size from}} 12 to 248 kg were <b>tagged</b> on <b>board</b> recreational boats in the western Mediterranean and the Adriatic Sea between May and September during two different periods (2000 to 2001 and 2008 to 2012). Although tuna migrations between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean have been well reported, our results indicate that part of the bluefin tuna population remains in the Mediterranean basin for much of the year, revealing a more complex population structure. In this study we demonstrate links between the western Mediterranean, the Adriatic and the Gulf of Sidra (Libya) using over 4336 recorded days of location and behavior data from tagged bluefin tuna with a maximum track length of 394 days. We described the oceanographic preferences and horizontal behaviors during the spawning season for 4 adult bluefin tuna. We also {{analyzed the}} time series data that reveals the vertical behavior of one pop-up satellite tag recovered, which was attached to a 43. 9 kg tuna. This fish displayed a unique diving pattern within 16 days of the spawning season, suggesting a use of the thermocline as a thermoregulatory mechanism compatible with spawning. The results obtained hereby confirm that the Mediterranean is clearly an important habitat for this species, not only as spawning ground, but also as an overwintering foraging ground...|$|R
40|$|Abstract— – The {{embedding}} {{of radio}} frequency identification (RFID) <b>tags</b> into plywood <b>boards</b> will enable the identification and tracking of individual plywood boards and end products of plywood. Even more benefits {{can be achieved by}} adding sensing functions into these tags. We present tags that are embeddable inside plywood by direct inkjet-printing on pure birch veneer. The use of passive UHF RFID technology in the plywood industry is discussed, two tag antenna designs for plywood are presented and the tag fabrication procedures are described. Furthermore, tag performance measurement results from various setups are presented to verify the concept of embedding RFID and sensor antennas into plywood structures. Measurements show that tags printed on veneer and embedded inside 2 mm thick plywood board exhibited theoretical read ranges from 7. 9 meters to 10. 3 meters. The read ranges obtained meet the demands of the plywood industry and offer reliable identification even in challenging environments.

40|$|Owing to the {{significant}} price drop of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) {{and the efforts}} to save natural resources, LCDs are even replacing paper to display static images such as price <b>tags</b> and advertising <b>boards.</b> Because of a growing market demand on such devices, the LCD that can be of numerous surface alignments of directors as its ground state, the so-called multi-stable LCD, comes into the limelight due to the great potential for low power consumption. However, the multi-stable LCD with industrial feasibility {{has not yet been}} successfully performed. In this paper, we propose a simple and novel configuration for the multi-stable LCD. We demonstrate experimentally and theoretically that a battery of stable surface alignments can be achieved by the field-induced surface dragging effect on an aligning layer with a weak surface anchoring. The simplicity and stability of the proposed system suggest that it is suitable for the multi-stable LCDs to display static images with low power consumption and thus opens applications in various fields.

40|$|Earth {{observation}} {{missions are}} generally operated by execution of predefined time-tagged commands. However, {{depending on the}} type of mission, issues relevant to different types of mission may occur. These issues are drivers for the design of the operations system of EnMAP (Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program). The main challenges are limited transfer of telecommands and limited downlink capabilities; also the cloud coverage in the target area - for optical sensors - plays a huge role. There are certain constraints, concerning this satellite bus in particular. For example a limited time tagged list which allows no more than 120 time <b>tagged</b> commands on <b>board.</b> Further the fact that every dumped house keeping packet has to be requested from the space craft which leads to a delay in the reception of telemetry can be a bottle neck. In addition to these S-band related issues it is a real challenge to coordinate the amount of payload data which will be down-linked via X-band. In this paper the strategy of managing all these difficulties and optimally operating the satellite under these conditions, will be described. For handling of cloud coverage a database with weather statistics will be implemented. These statistics are compared with global forecast models as provided by e. g. the German weather service (DWD). With the calculated forecast values, planning priority of datatakes is increased or decreased...|$|R
