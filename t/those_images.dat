40|$|PURPOSE: To {{retrospectively}} {{determine the}} accuracy of T 2 -weighted endorectal MR imaging in the detection of prostate cancer after external beam radiation therapy and to investigate the relationship between imaging accuracy and time since therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained and the study was HIPPA compliant. We identified 59 patients who underwent 1. 5 Tesla endorectal MR imaging of the prostate between 1999 and 2006 after definitive external beam radiation therapy for biopsy-proven prostate cancer. Two readers recorded {{the presence or absence}} of tumor on T 2 -weighted images. Logistic regression and Fisher&# 8217;s exact tests for 2 x 2 tables were used to determine {{the accuracy of}} imaging and investigate if accuracy differed between <b>those</b> <b>imaged</b> within 3 years of therapy (n = 25) and <b>those</b> <b>imaged</b> more than 3 years after therapy (n = 34). Transrectal biopsy was used as the standard of reference for {{the presence or absence of}} recurrent cancer. RESULTS: Thirty-four of 59 patients (58 %) had recurrent prostate cancer detected on biopsy. The overall accuracy of T 2 -weighted MR imaging in the detection cancer after external beam radiation therapy was 63 % (37 / 59) for reader 1 and 71 % for reader 2 (42 / 59). For both readers, logistic regression showed no difference in accuracy between <b>those</b> <b>imaged</b> within 3 years of therapy and <b>those</b> <b>imaged</b> more than 3 years after therapy (p = 0. 86 for reader 1 and 0. 44 for reader 2). CONCLUSION: T 2 -weighted endorectal MR imaging has low accuracy in the detection of prostate cancer after external beam radiation therapy, irrespective of the time since therapy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the use the Jensen Shannon {{divergence}} for guiding denoising. In particular, it aims at detecting <b>those</b> <b>image</b> regions where noise is masked; denoising is then inhibited where it is useless from the visual point of view. To this aim a reduced reference version of the Jensen Shannon divergence is introduced and it is used for determining a denoising map. The latter separates <b>those</b> <b>image</b> pixels that require to be denoised from those {{that have to be}} leaved unaltered. Experimental results show that the proposed method allows to improve denoising performance of some simple and conventional denoisers, in terms of both peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM). In addition, it can contribute to reduce the computational effort of some performing denoisers, while preserving the visual quality of denoised images...|$|R

Because each eyelet is a simple eye, it produces an inverted image; <b>those</b> <b>images</b> are combined in the brain to form one unified image. Because the aperture of an eyelet is larger than the facets of a compound eye, this arrangement allows vision under low light levels.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} a motion picture or video {{recording}} of the previously described scenario of a police officer arresting a man, the filmmakers, videographers, and editors may reframe this scene, by fragmenting the recording, depicting it from different vantage points, editing the material, and reassembling these components.

25|$|The {{dihedral}} group D4 is {{the group}} of symmetries (symmetry group) of a square. This group contains four rotations and four reflections. It is generated by alternating reflections about the x-axis and about a diagonal. One free polyomino corresponds to at most 8 fixed polyominoes, which are its images under the symmetries of D4. However, <b>those</b> <b>images</b> are not necessarily distinct: the more symmetry a free polyomino has, the fewer distinct fixed counterparts it has. Therefore, a free polyomino that is invariant under some or all non-trivial symmetries of D4 may correspond to only 4, 2 or 1 fixed polyominoes. Mathematically, free polyominoes are equivalence classes of fixed polyominoes under the group D4.|$|E
25|$|Monopack color {{films are}} based on the {{subtractive}} color system, which filters colors from white light by using superimposed cyan, magenta and yellow dye images. <b>Those</b> <b>images</b> are created from records of the amounts of red, green and blue light present at each point of the image formed by the camera lens. A subtractive primary color (cyan, magenta, yellow) is what remains when one of the additive primary colors (red, green, blue) has been removed from the spectrum. Eastman Kodak's monopack color films incorporated three separate layers of differently color sensitive emulsion into one strip of film. Each layer recorded one of the additive primaries and was processed to produce a dye image in the complementary subtractive primary.|$|E

500|$|After Crane's {{premature}} death from tuberculosis {{at the age}} of 28, his work enjoyed a resurgence of popularity. Author and critic Elbert Hubbard wrote in Crane's obituary in the Philistine that [...] "The Open Boat" [...] was [...] "the sternest, creepiest bit of realism ever penned". Also noting the depressing Realism utilized in the story, editor Vincent Starrett stated: [...] "It is a desolate picture, and the tale is one of our greatest short stories." [...] Another of the author's friends, H. G. Wells, wrote that [...] "The Open Boat" [...] was [...] "beyond all question, the crown of all [...] work." [...] Singling out Crane's usage of color and chiaroscuro in his writing, Wells continued: [...] "It has all the stark power of the earlier stories, with a new element of restraint; the color is as full and strong as ever, fuller and stronger, indeed; but those chromatic splashes that at times deafen and confuse in The Red Badge, <b>those</b> <b>images</b> that astonish rather than enlighten, are disciplined and controlled." [...] The story remains popular with critics; Thomas Kent referred to [...] "The Open Boat" [...] as Crane's [...] "magnum opus", while Crane biographer Stanley Wertheim called it [...] "Crane's finest short story and one of the masterworks of late nineteenth-century American literature".|$|E

[...] The new scenes of the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen, are interspersed with previously shown footage of the White Walkers, as well as wildfire explosions, and other landmark moments from throughout the series, such as Ned Stark's beheading, the Red Wedding, and Bran falling from the Broken Tower in the series premiere. In the A Song of Ice and Fire series by George R. R. Martin, the Mad King is described as having long, unkempt hair and beard, with nine inch long fingernails.
