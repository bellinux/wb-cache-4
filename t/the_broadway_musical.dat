5|$|Belle has {{garnered}} widespread acclaim from {{film critics}} who appreciated the character's bravery, intelligence and independence. Reception towards her feminism, however, {{has been more}} mixed, with commentators accusing the character's actions of being romance-oriented. The fifth Disney Princess, Belle is often ranked among the franchise's best. Highly {{regarded as one of}} Disney's strongest examples of a feminist character, critics agree that Belle helped spearhead a generation of independent film heroines while changing the reputation of a Disney princess. Also one of Disney's most iconic characters, Belle was the only animated heroine nominated for the American Film Institute's greatest heroes in film ranking. The character also appears in the film's several sequels and spin-offs, as well as her own live-action television series. American actress Susan Egan originated the role of Belle in <b>the</b> <b>Broadway</b> <b>musical</b> adaptation of the film, for which she was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. Emma Watson plays a live-action version of the character in a 2017 live action adaptation of the original 1991 film.|$|E
5|$|Director Bill Condon {{originally}} intended to include most songs from <b>the</b> <b>Broadway</b> <b>musical</b> adaptation of Beauty and the Beast in the remake. However, Disney ultimately decided to recruit composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice to write entirely new songs for the film instead. Original Beauty and the Beast composer Menken reunited with Rice, {{with whom he had}} previously collaborated on Disney's animated film Aladdin (1992), to write three new songs for the remake. Rice once again replaced original Beauty and the Beast lyricist Howard Ashman, who had passed away shortly before the animated film's release in 1991, similar {{to the way in which}} he replaced the lyricist to aid Menken in writing new material for the 1994 stage adaptation. Menken believes that the songs he and Rice had written for the stage musical would not have translated well to the screen due to structural differences between the two formats.|$|E
5|$|Pfeiffer {{returned}} to the screen in 2007 with villainous roles in two major summer blockbusters — Hairspray and Stardust. In the film adaptation of <b>the</b> <b>Broadway</b> <b>musical</b> Hairspray, she starred with John Travolta, Christopher Walken, Zac Efron and Queen Latifah, portraying the role of Velma Von Tussle, the racist and sizeist manager of a music station. Travolta requested that Pfeiffer play {{the part of the}} villainess, which was her first film role in five years. A widely positive reception greeted the film upon its release, while it made an impressive US$118.9 million and US$202.5 million worldwide. The cast of Hairspray was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture, but won the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Cast, the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Ensemble of the Year and the Palm Springs International Film Festival Award for Ensemble Cast. Her next film release, the fantasy adventure Stardust, opposite Claire Danes, Charlie Cox and Robert De Niro, saw her play the ancient witch Lamia. Filmed before Hairspray, the film premiered three weeks afterwards; it garnered largely positive reviews but, budgeted at US70 million, it made a modest US$135.5 million globally.|$|E
