Van Eyck's mastery at handling oil can be seen in the differing breadths of brush strokes.

5|$|Blackleg is a {{fungal disease}} of canola {{that results in}} major yield loss in {{affected}} crops. It overwinters on infected stubble (leftover crop residue) that is left on farm fields, and can continue to produce spores, infecting future crops, until <b>the</b> <b>stubble</b> is buried or broken down completely. The observation that C.olla grows and fruits on canola stubble has led to research on the potential of this fungus to degrade canola stubble, and {{reduce the incidence of}} stubble-borne diseases like blackleg and blackspot. In a study of its lignin-degrading abilities, C.olla was shown to colonize canola, wheat, and barley residue, but appeared to have a preference for the woody taproots of canola as compared to the cereal residue.|$|E

Burning of <b>the</b> <b>stubble</b> of {{perennial}} rice could reduce these populations, but burning may not be permitted in some areas. Furthermore, rodents and insects living underground would survive burning, whereas tillage disrupts their habitat.|$|E

25|$|In each field {{possessed the}} farmer his {{individual}} acre. It {{was not a}} working association of farmers, but of a village community. The three-field did not let an intensive livestock. The common grazing on the fallow, the unfertilized Allmend and <b>the</b> <b>stubble</b> fields, {{and the lack of}} winter feeding offered only a meager food. For centuries, forest trees were debranched for winter feed. Agriculture froze in the three-field.|$|E
25|$|Harvest was in {{the late}} spring and during the dry summer months. Nomadic Amorites from the {{northwest}} would pasture their flocks of sheep and goats to graze on <b>the</b> <b>stubble</b> and be watered from the river and irrigation canals. For this privilege, {{they would have to}} pay a tax in wool, meat, milk, and cheese to the temples, who would distribute these products to the bureaucracy and priesthood. In good years, all would go well, but in bad years, wild winter pastures would be in short supply, nomads would seek to pasture their flocks in the grain fields, and conflicts with farmers would result. It would appear that the subsidizing of southern populations by the import of wheat from the north of the Empire temporarily overcame this problem, and it seems to have allowed economic recovery and a growing population within this region.|$|E
25|$|In the Punjab {{region of}} India and Pakistan, {{as well as}} North China, {{irrigation}} {{has been a major}} contributor to increased grain output. More widely over the last 40 years, a massive increase in fertilizer use together with the increased availability of semi-dwarf varieties in developing countries, has greatly increased yields per hectare. In developing countries, use of (mainly nitrogenous) fertilizer increased 25-fold in this period. However, farming systems rely on much more than fertilizer and breeding to improve productivity. A good illustration of this is Australian wheat growing in the southern winter cropping zone, where, despite low rainfall (300mm), wheat cropping is successful even with relatively little use of nitrogenous fertilizer. This is achieved by 'rotation cropping' (traditionally called the ley system) with leguminous pastures and, in the last decade, including a canola crop in the rotations has boosted wheat yields by a further 25%. In these low rainfall areas, better use of available soil-water (and better control of soil erosion) is achieved by retaining <b>the</b> <b>stubble</b> after harvesting and by minimizing tillage.|$|E

50|$|Proso millet is a {{relatively}} low-demanding crop and diseases are not known; consequently, proso millet is often used in organic farming systems in Europe. In the United States it is often used as an intercrop. Thus, proso millet can help to avoid a summer fallow, and continuous crop rotation can be achieved. Its superficial root system and its resistance to atrazine residue make proso millet a good intercrop between two water- and pesticide-demanding crops. <b>The</b> <b>stubbles</b> of <b>the</b> last crop, by allowing more heat into the soil, result in a faster and earlier millet growth. While millet occupies the ground, because of its superficial root system, the soil can replenish its water content for the next crop. Later crops, for example, a winter wheat, can in turn benefit from <b>the</b> millet <b>stubble,</b> which act as snow accumulators.|$|R

500|$|Tigers have muscular {{bodies with}} {{powerful}} forelimbs, large heads and long tails. The pelage is dense and heavy; colouration varies between shades of orange and brown with white ventral areas and distinctive vertical black stripes, whose patterns {{are unique to}} each individual. Their function is likely for camouflage in vegetation such as long grass with strong vertical patterns of light and shade. The tiger {{is one of only}} a few striped cat species; it is not known why spotted patterns and rosettes are the more common camouflage pattern among felids. A tiger's coat pattern is still visible when it is shaved. This is due not to skin pigmentation, but to <b>the</b> <b>stubble</b> and hair follicles embedded in the skin, similar to human beards (colloquially five o'clock shadow), and is in common with other big cats. They have a mane-like heavy growth of fur around the neck and jaws and long whiskers, especially in males. The pupils are circular with yellow irises. The small, rounded ears have a prominent white spot on the back, surrounded by black.

2500|$|Removal of ergot bodies is done {{by placing}} the yield in a brine solution; the ergot bodies float while the healthy grains sink. Infested fields need to be deep plowed; ergot cannot {{germinate}} if buried more than one inch in soil and therefore won't release its spores into the air. Rotating crops using non-susceptible plants helps reduce infestations since ergot spores only live one year. Crop rotation and deep tillage, such as deep moldboard ploughing, are important components in managing ergot, as many cereal crops in the 21st Century are sown with a [...] "no-till" [...] practice (new crops are seeded directly into <b>the</b> <b>stubble</b> from the previous crop to reduce soil erosion).

2500|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} the disruption of the Russian Revolution, which decreased the supply of wheat and other commodity crops, and World War I increased agricultural prices; this demand encouraged farmers to dramatically increase cultivation. [...] For example, in the Llano Estacado of eastern New Mexico and northwestern Texas, the area of farmland was doubled between 1900 and 1920, then tripled again between 1925 and 1930. The agricultural methods favored by farmers during this period created the conditions for large-scale erosion under certain environmental conditions. [...] The widespread conversion of the land by deep plowing and other soil preparation methods to enable agriculture eliminated the native grasses which held the soil in place and helped retain moisture during dry periods. [...] Furthermore, cotton farmers left fields bare during winter months, when winds in the High Plains are highest, and burned <b>the</b> <b>stubble</b> {{as a means to}} control weeds prior to planting, thereby depriving the soil of organic nutrients and surface vegetation.|$|E
