5|$|Originally, Betelgeuse {{was to call}} at Sines, Portugal, <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> {{the load}} of the ship, but poor weather {{conditions}} prevented the vessel from entering the harbour. Plans were further frustrated at Leixões, where a ship had run aground across the harbour entrance, preventing Betelgeuse from berthing there to discharge her cargo. Betelgeuse was then instructed to sail for Whiddy Island, Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In early October the two {{companies}} reached Fort Laramie, Wyoming, where they expected to be restocked with provisions, but no provisions were there for them. The companies had to cut back food rations, hoping that their supplies would last until help could be sent from Utah. <b>To</b> <b>lighten</b> their loads, the Martin Company cut the luggage allowance to 10 pounds (4.5 kg) per person, discarding clothing and blankets that soon would be desperately needed.|$|E

50|$|Although Earth briefly {{rises above}} the horizon thanks to the Moon's libration, the Pacific Ocean is facing towards the lunar surface and so contact with North America cannot be established. The crew set {{themselves}} <b>to</b> <b>lightening</b> their spaceship {{as much as possible}} to improve their chances of returning home safely. During this process, they review their developed film and discover a small base has been established on the Moon. They wonder whether this base possibly might be Soviet or even alien in origin. Admiral Bowles immediately changes his previous position: they must now return to Earth and provide this important information to U. S. military intelligence. They proceed <b>to</b> further <b>lighten</b> their spaceship of all possible unnecessary weight and finally launch for home.|$|R
50|$|This {{marriage}} was only accepted by Wilhelmine under threats {{from her father}} and with a view <b>to</b> <b>lightening</b> her brother's disgrace. It was initially a happy marriage, but was eventually clouded first by limited financial resources and then by a love affair of the future Margrave with Dorothea von Marwitz, whose rise as an official mistress at the court of Bayreuth was bitterly resented by her brother Frederick the Great and caused an estrangement of some three years between him and Wilhelmine.|$|R
5|$|The Spanish Navy hired two salvage {{companies}} to refloat the battleship, but both declined after they surveyed the wreck. Unable to raise her, the Spanish decided to remove as much weight {{as possible from}} España in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> her to permit refloating. Her guns were removed and dropped overboard {{to be picked up}} later by the salvage vessel Kanguro. The battleship's armor, machinery, and ammunition stores were also removed <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> her. Her hull was then sealed and partially drained in preparation for raising, but while waiting for the necessary equipment from Italy, several violent storms hit the ship and caused further damage. The battered hull could now no longer be raised, and in November 1924, she broke in half and was abandoned by the Spanish Navy. The 305mm and 102mm guns recovered from España were installed in coastal batteries, some of which remained in service until 1999 before they were retired from service. After the overthrow of King Alfonso XIII, his namesake ship Alfonso XIII, was renamed España in April 1931.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{confusion}} allowed Belvidera to fire her stern chasers, killing {{six more}} men aboard President. Rodgers {{kept up the}} pursuit, using his bow chasers to severely damage Belvideras rigging, but his two broadsides had little effect. The crew of Belvidera quickly made repairs to the rigging. They cut loose her anchors and boats and pumped drinking water overboard <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> her load, thereby increasing her speed. Belvidera soon gained enough speed to distance herself from President, and Rodgers abandoned the pursuit. Belvidera sailed to Halifax to deliver the news that war had been declared.|$|E
5|$|The female {{relies on}} her hind feet for digging. She may {{accumulate}} so much sand and mud {{on her feet}} that her mobility is reduced, making her vulnerable to predators. <b>To</b> <b>lighten</b> her labors, she lubricates the area with her bladder water. Once the nest is complete, the female deposits into the hole. The freshly laid eggs are white, elliptical, porous, and flexible. From start to finish, the female's work may take fourhours. Sometimes she remains on land overnight afterwards, before returning to her home water.|$|E
40|$|It is very {{important}} for electric power transmission line to protect the electric surge due <b>to</b> <b>lightening.</b> It is therefore indespensable <b>to</b> forecast the <b>lightening.</b> The measurement of the electric charge of snow fragments and rain dorops is intended for examining the relations of the electric charge of them, the snow falling and the lightening. It is carried out successively by a simple method which consists of an accumulating metal plate of the snow fragments on the porcelain insulator column and a high sensitive electrometer. It is found from the measurements that snow fragments with both electric polarities fall down alternatively and the almost same charge fall down in one falling period. A simple theory of lightening in winter is proposed based on the charge measurements. 電力送電線にとって雷撃による電気的サージを防ぐことは非常に大切である。それ故，雷撃の予測は不可欠である。降雪の電気量，降雪と雷撃の関係を調べるために，降雪の荷電量の測定を意図した。これは簡単な方法により，成功裡に行われた。この方法は長幹碍子の上に乗せた雪を集める金属板と高感度のエレクトロメータから構成されている。これらの測定から，両方の電気的極性をもつ雪が交互に降って来ることおよび一回の降雪の間にほぼ等量の電荷が降りて来ることが分った。これらの電荷測定にもとずき，冬季雷撃に関する簡単な理論を提案する...|$|R

5|$|The last {{survivors}} of the Batavian squadron were harried along the coast by the faster forces in the British fleet with Sylph overhauling the 16-gun Mercury, forcing it to surrender just before 11:00. The Batavian captain had thrown 14 cannon overboard in an effort <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> his ship {{and allow it to}} escape British pursuit, but without success. Later in the day, Halstead's Phoenix was able to seize the Batavian prize Duke of York, completing the destruction of the entire Batavian squadron.|$|E
5|$|Then-Lieutenant Alessandro Guidoni {{proposed}} in 1912 to convert Piemonte into {{an aircraft carrier}} capable of operating seaplanes and fixed-wheel aircraft. His projected reconstruction would have seen an inclined flight deck erected on the aft half of the ship, tall enough to clear the ships' funnels. The Regia Marina {{were not interested in}} operating wheeled aircraft at sea and so the idea was not pursued. In 1913, the last two of the ship's 6-inch guns were replaced with 4.7-inch guns in another attempt <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> the ship.|$|E
5|$|A {{formidable}} French squadron {{under the}} command of Rear-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Léon Durand Linois had left Toulon bound for Cadiz to collect reinforcements for Napoleon's army in Egypt. On 3July they sighted and chased Speedy, and Cochrane ordered the guns, boats, and provisions thrown overboard <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> the ship. The French caught up nonetheless, and after narrowly avoiding the broadside of Desaix, Cochrane struck his colours. He was taken aboard Desaix, where her captain, Christy-Pallière, recognised Cochrane's accomplishments by refusing to accept his sword. Cochrane was taken along with the fleet and watched the Battle of Algeciras Bay from Desaix. He and the crew of Speedy were later exchanged after the battle. On returning to Gibraltar he was court-martialled for the loss of his ship, and honourably acquitted.|$|E

40|$|Protection {{of power}} system is an {{important}} aspect for the continued service of the electrical power system. Mostly the protection of electrical power depends {{on the performance of}} insulation systems under transient over voltage conditions arises due <b>to</b> <b>lightening</b> and switching applications. Transient over voltages in addition to the abrupt changes in the state of power systems, e. g. switching operations or faults are known as switching impulse voltages and that due <b>to</b> <b>lightening</b> are known as lightening impulse voltages. Very short pulse high-voltage or high-current surges can be produced by an electrical apparatus known as impulse generator. High impulse voltages are used to test the durability of electric power equipment against lightning and switching surges. The Marx Impulse generator is used to generate such high impulse voltages. A total of eight stages of both Standard as well as Improved Marx Impulse generator were designed and the impulse waves were recorded. These recorded impulse waves were compared with the standard impulse wave with front time of 1. 2 µ seconds and fall time of 50 µ seconds. The energy and efficiency of all the stages were calculated and the percentage of error in the rise time and fall time was also found out. The simulation was done with the help of NI Multisim Software Package. A small practical prototype of second stage of Standard Marx Impulse Generator circuit was also designed for a voltage source of 12 V and its output impulse wave was compared with that of the standard impulse wave...|$|R

5|$|Amid {{a torrent}} of Japanese fire, the Australians broke contact and made for the landing craft, {{bringing}} the wounded out with them. The embarkation took only five minutes, but as the vessels attempted to depart two of them, overloaded with about 60 men on board, ran aground and stuck fast. In an effort <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> the load, several men volunteered to leave the craft, which enabled one of the vessels to float free. The other, however, remained stuck. Coming under attack from the Japanese, some of whom waded out and attacked {{the men in the}} vessel with grenades, the casualties mounted, with a number of men, including Downs, being either killed or lost overboard and subsequently listed as missing, presumed killed.|$|E
5|$|Gil González Dávila set {{out from}} Santo Domingo early in 1524, with the {{intention}} of exploring the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course took him to the north coast of Honduras, where he was beset by a storm. In order <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> the load of his ships, he ordered that a number of horses be thrown overboard. This event resulted in the place being named Puerto de Caballos ("Port of Horses"). González Dávila landed on the north coast, with authorisation to conquer Honduras from the king, after having sent the royal fifth of his proceeds from campaigns in Panama and Nicaragua, a sum totalling 112,524 gold castellanos. Puerto de Caballos later developed into an important staging point for the colonisation of the region.|$|E

5|$|Rundgren {{had become}} {{confident}} enough at other instruments beyond his standard guitar and keyboards {{that he had}} tackled in earlier releases, and this, coupled with a general dissatisfaction with other studio musicians, led him to temporarily relocate to Los Angeles {{in an attempt to}} record an entire album single-handedly. After he had created significantly more material than would fit on a standard LP, an earthquake struck LA. He decided to head back to New York for some live sessions, with the help of Moogy Klingman, <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> the mood. The final sessions were in Bearsville, where the remainder of the recording and mixing took place, and this created enough material for a double album.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} vertebrae of Apatosaurus {{are less}} elongated and more heavily constructed {{than those of}} Diplodocus, a diplodocid like Apatosaurus, and {{the bones of the}} leg are much stockier despite being longer, implying that Apatosaurus was a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. Apatosaurus had a single claw on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb. The Apatosaurus skull, long thought to be similar to Camarasaurus, is much more similar to that of Diplodocus. Apatosaurus was a generalized browser that likely held its head elevated. <b>To</b> <b>lighten</b> its vertebrae, Apatosaurus had air sacs that made the bones internally full of holes. Like that of other diplodocids, its tail may have been used as a whip to create loud noises.|$|E
5|$|The {{dogs have}} blue, liver or sandy colouration, {{all three of}} which may have tan points. Bedlingtons carry {{what is known as}} the greying gene, a {{dominant}} trait carried on the G locus. This gene causes puppies born with black or dark brown fur <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> to grey or liver with age. The fur of the Bedlington creates a shape on the top of the dog's head known as a topknot. Although most modern breed standards call for the dog's topknot to be lighter than its body, when the breed was first being formed there was at least one prominent breeder, Mr. Pickett, who believed that the topknot should be darker, not lighter.|$|E

5|$|Watney {{begins the}} 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli and the pre-positioned Ares IV MAV. To {{rendezvous}} with Hermes, Watney removes many components from the MAV, including the nose cone, <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> it, {{replacing it with}} a piece of the Hab's canvas. As the MAV fails to reach the required speed and altitude, Lewis is forced to use maneuvering thrusters to change course and explosive decompression of Hermess internal atmosphere to reduce speed. When even that is not enough, Commander Lewis uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit, but still cannot reach Watney. Watney pierces the glove of his pressure suit and uses the escaping air to propel himself towards Lewis, effectively rescuing him after being alone for 560 Sols on Mars.|$|E
5|$|In April 1770, Endeavour {{became the}} first ship to reach {{the east coast of}} Australia, when Cook went ashore at what is now known as Botany Bay. Endeavour then sailed north along the Australian coast. She {{narrowly}} avoided disaster after running aground on the Great Barrier Reef, and Cook had to throw her guns overboard <b>to</b> <b>lighten</b> her. He then beached her on the mainland for seven weeks to permit rudimentary repairs to her hull. On 10 October 1770, she limped into port in Batavia (now named Jakarta) in the Dutch East Indies for more substantial repairs, her crew sworn to secrecy about the lands they had visited. She resumed her westward journey on 26 December, rounded the Cape of Good Hope on 13 March 1771, and reached the English port of Dover on 12 July, having been at sea for nearly three years.|$|E

5|$|Converting Campbeltown for {{the raid}} took ten days. She had <b>to</b> be <b>lightened</b> <b>to</b> raise her draught {{to get over}} the sand banks in the estuary. This was {{achieved}} by completely stripping all her internal compartments. The dockyard removed her three 4inch (100mm) guns, torpedoes and depth charges from the deck and replaced the forward gun with a light quick–firing 12 pounder (3"). Eight 20mm Oerlikons were installed on mountings raised above deck level. The bridge and wheelhouse were given extra armour-plate protection, and two rows of armour were fixed along the sides of the ship to protect the Commandos on the open deck.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt is well {{established}} in litterature that popular saying "money whitens" is a strong mechanism of skin color self-declarations in Brazil. It was indeed observed comparing self-declarations and declarations by a third – mainly the interviewer – that the higher the educational level, the lighter the declaration by respondents. The same link was assessed for wages and income. These researches do not include a full analysis of darkening and chromatic immobility. Admittedly darkening is sometimes mentioned, but it is rather a strict counterpart of lightening than a choice for itself: if "money whitens", "poverty darkens". But contemporary evolutions of representations in brazilian society lead notably to a valorization of darkening. In this paper, I construct a chromatic mobility model <b>to</b> analyse <b>lightening,</b> darkening and chromatic immobility together. In this model, the mobility is realized by the respondent {{in relation to the}} perception of a third. Each individual realizes a trade-off to maximizes its satisfaction. This trade-off calls together personal identity and social identity. The empirical application of this chromatic mobility model relies on original data collected during a field research conducting in São Paulo (november 2006 – august 2007). I conclude that the link between chromatic mobility and educationnal level has to be nuanced. Indeed, it exists a threshold above which darkening is prefered <b>to</b> <b>lightening.</b> I although underline variables which are linked to chromatic immobility...|$|R
