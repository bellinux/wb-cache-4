5|$|Philosophical behaviorism {{has fallen}} out of favor since {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of cognitivism. Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several {{perceived}} problems. For example, behaviorism could be said to be counter-intuitive when it maintains that someone is talking about behavior in the event <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> experiencing a painful headache.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} {{should not}} be used without a medical indication, such as with a reason to expect <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> at heightened risk of having deep vein thrombosis. This screening is not effective at diagnosing DVT in the absence of other indications that the patient may have this condition. A common example of overuse of this procedure is the practice of performing ultrasonography routinely on patients without indication after knee or hip replacement.|$|E
5|$|Non-citizens {{detained}} {{under the}} ISA {{do not have}} a right to make representations to an advisory board. They may, within two months from the date of the detention order, make written representations to the Minister. The Minister may, but is not bound to, refer the representations to an advisory board. Any decision on such representations by the Minister is final and cannot be called into question in any court. The burden of proving <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> a citizen lies on the person claiming to be one, and again the Minister's decision on the matter is final.|$|E

5|$|In {{its early}} stages, esophageal cancer {{may not have}} any {{symptoms}} at all. When severe, esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the esophagus, making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, and whether there are any metastases {{in different parts of}} the body. Esophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of the esophagus. Inserting a stent into the esophagus, or inserting a nasogastric tube, may also be used to ensure <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> able to digest enough food and water. , the prognosis for esophageal cancer is still poor, so palliative therapy may also be a focus of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Victor Fresco, the show's creator, has cited {{his being}} a new parent as {{inspiration}} for the show. In an interview with NPR, he discussed how having a kid piqued his interest to develop a show about the disconnection between a person's public and personal lives, such as how parents teach their kids to be moral, yet work for giant corporations. According to Fresco, Ted Crisp is the single father and his daughter serves as his moral compass. Fresco stated that since he's worked for a few giant companies, he didn't base Veridian Dynamics on any specific corporation. The show's name {{was based on the}} idea <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> better off if they are Ted, that essentially the average person wants to be Ted. Fresco has stated that he wasn't a fan of the show's title, but hadn't spoken of changing it.|$|E
25|$|Radiation {{around the}} pool can get so high <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> not allowed to stay more than 2 minutes, seriously {{affecting}} decommissioning. The pool is not watertight; time and weather have created cracks in the concrete, letting contaminated water leak.|$|E

5000|$|Sections 241A, 243, and 244 {{were later}} repealed; {{all three were}} {{designed}} in some part to disenfranchise minority voting (241A required <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>be</b> [...] "of good moral character", 243 instituted a poll tax, and 244 instituted a literacy test).|$|R
50|$|In 2015 Inside Housing {{reported}} that Southwalk Council admitted to 'poor practices' including forcing applicants {{to prove that}} they are homeless through no fault of their own and requiring <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>be</b> unemployed in order for the Council to provide interim accommodation.|$|R
25|$|The {{argument}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> {{not required}} to file a tax return or pay tax unless the Internal Revenue Service responds to the person's questions, etc., and variations of this argument, have been officially identified as legally frivolous Federal tax return positions for purposes of the $5,000 frivolous tax return penalty imposed under Internal Revenue Code section 6702(a).|$|E
25|$|To {{the extent}} <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> fearful of social {{encounters}} with unfamiliar others, {{some people may}} experience anxiety particularly during interactions with outgroup members, or people who share different group memberships (i.e., by race, ethnicity, class, gender, etc.). Depending {{on the nature of}} the antecedent relations, cognitions, and situational factors, intergroup contact may be stressful and lead to feelings of anxiety. This apprehension or fear of contact with outgroup members is often called interracial or intergroup anxiety.|$|E
25|$|The bathing was {{considered}} sufficiently purifying {{only if it}} confirmed {{to the rules of}} madi. The word madi is used by Tamil Brahmins to indicate <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> bodily pure. In order to practice madi, the Brahmin had to wear only clothes which had been recently washed and dried, and the clothes should remain untouched by any person who was not madi. Only after taking bath in cold water, and after wearing such clothes, would the person be in a state of madi.|$|E
50|$|The {{death penalty}} is abolished. A court may order <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>be</b> {{detained}} indefinitely even after the sentence is completed, if the <b>person</b> <b>is</b> convicted of particularly serious crimes and is judged, after expert testimony, to be {{a danger to the}} public (Sicherungsverwahrung).|$|R

25|$|Proof {{beyond a}} {{reasonable}} doubt, therefore, is proof of such a convincing character that one {{would be willing to}} rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of one's own affairs. However, it does not mean an absolute certainty. The standard that must be met by the prosecution's evidence in a criminal prosecution is that no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant committed the crime, thereby overcoming the presumption <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> innocent unless and until proven guilty.|$|E
25|$|While a principle-based {{approach}} might {{claim that}} lying is always morally wrong, the casuist would argue that, {{depending upon the}} details of the case, lying might or might not be illegal or unethical. The casuist might conclude <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> wrong to lie in legal testimony under oath, but might argue that lying actually is the best moral choice if the lie saves a life. (Thomas Sanchez and others thus theorized a doctrine of mental reservation, which developed into its own branch of casuistry.) For the casuist, the circumstances of a case are essential for evaluating the proper response.|$|E
25|$|An indulgence {{does not}} forgive {{the guilt of}} sin, nor does it provide release from the eternal {{punishment}} associated with unforgiven mortal sins. The Catholic Church teaches that indulgences relieve only the temporal punishment resulting from the effect of sin (the effect of rejecting God the source of good), and <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> still required to have his grave sins absolved, ordinarily through the sacrament of Confession, to receive salvation. Similarly, an indulgence is not a permit to commit sin, a pardon of future sin, nor a guarantee of salvation for oneself or for another. Ordinarily, forgiveness of mortal sins is obtained through Confession (i.e., penance or reconciliation).|$|E
5000|$|Travis Hirschi adopted Toby's {{concept of}} an {{investment}} in conventionality or [...] "stake in conformity". He stressed the rationality in the decision whether to engage in crime and argued <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> less likely to choose crime if they had strong social bonds.|$|R

50|$|For persons born {{prior to}} 1900, the month {{identifier}} (third and fourth digits) is increased by 20 (e.g. 952324XXXX denotes <b>a</b> <b>person</b> born on 24 March 1895). Similarly, 40 {{is added to}} denote <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> born after 1999 (e.g. 054907XXXX denotes <b>a</b> <b>person</b> born on 7 September 2005).|$|R
25|$|In {{psychological}} {{research on}} altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial {{behaviors such as}} helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service. Research has found that people {{are most likely to}} help if they recognize <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress. Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the Bystander effect). Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility. However, a witness {{with a high level of}} empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders. A feeling of personal responsibility or - moral norm - has also strongly been associated with other pro-social behaviors such as charitable giving.|$|E
25|$|When van is {{followed}} by the name of a place or area, this may (but usually does not) indicate that a person belongs to the nobility or royalty such as van Tuyll van Serooskerken. This usage exists also in Flemish names, though its nobility usually obtained the French prefix 'de'. In Dutch aristocratic names, the prefix is never capitalized. This results in people being very strict about whether the prefix in someone's name should be capitalized or not, and in emigrants from the Netherlands always having an uncapitalized prefix. Van can also indicate <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> from a certain farm. The ancestors of the Dutch soprano Elma van Den Dool lived on a farm called Den Dool. The first letter of Den gets capitalised (she is from Den Dool).|$|E
500|$|The {{power of}} the Court to require that this be done is {{specifically}} mentioned in Article 9(2) of the Constitution of Singapore, which states: [...] "Where a complaint is made to the High Court or any Judge thereof <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> being unlawfully detained, the Court shall inquire into the complaint and, unless satisfied that the detention is lawful, shall order him to be produced before the Court and release him." ...|$|E

50|$|Evidence <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>was</b> or was not insured against {{liability}} is not admissible {{upon the}} issue whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully. This rule {{does not require}} the exclusion of evidence of insurance against liability when offered for another purpose, such as proof of agency, ownership, or control, or bias or prejudice of a witness.|$|R
500|$|In United States v. Mendenhall (1980), the Court held <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> seized only when, {{by means}} of {{physical}} force or show of authority, his freedom of movement is restrained and, in {{the circumstances surrounding the}} incident, a reasonable person would believe that he was not free to leave. In Florida v. Bostick (1991), the Court ruled {{that as long as the}} police do not convey a message that compliance with their requests is required, the police contact is a [...] "citizen encounter" [...] that falls outside the protections of the Fourth Amendment. If a person remains free to disregard questioning by the government, there has been no seizure and therefore no intrusion upon the person's privacy under the Fourth Amendment.|$|E
500|$|Because Cho was not involuntarily {{committed}} to a mental health facility as an inpatient, he was still legally eligible to buy guns under Virginia law. However, according to Virginia law, [...] " [...] magistrate {{has the authority to}} issue a detention order upon a finding <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> mentally ill and in need of hospitalization or treatment." [...] The magistrate also must find that the person is an imminent danger to himself or others. Virginia officials and other law experts have argued that, under United States federal law, Barnett's order meant that Cho had been [...] "adjudicated as a mental defective" [...] and was thus ineligible to purchase firearms under federal law; and that the state of Virginia erred in not enforcing the requirements of the federal law.|$|E
500|$|Cotton's {{theology}} espoused <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>person</b> <b>is</b> {{helpless to}} affect his own salvation, and instead is totally dependent on God's free grace. [...] In contrast, {{most of the}} other New England ministers were [...] "preparationists", espousing the view that morality and good works were needed to prepare one for God's salvation. [...] Most members of Cotton's Boston church became very attracted to his theology, including his admirer Anne Hutchinson. She was a charismatic woman who hosted 60 or more people at her home each week to discuss Cotton's sermons, but also to criticize the colony's other ministers. [...] Another highly important advocate of Cotton's theology was the colony's young governor Henry Vane, who had built an addition onto Cotton's house where he lived during his time in Boston. [...] Hutchinson and Vane followed the teachings of Cotton, but both of them also held some views that were considered unorthodox, and even radical.|$|E
