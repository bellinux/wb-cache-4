5|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} plants may use thermal storage <b>to</b> <b>store</b> solar energy, such as in {{high-temperature}} molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the Solar Two power station, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>store</b> 1.44TJ in its 68m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.|$|E

5|$|In 1780, {{the society}} moved again, {{this time to}} Somerset House. The {{property}} was offered to the society by His Majesty's Government and, as soon as Sir Joseph Banks became president in November 1778, he began planning the move. Somerset House, while larger than Crane Court, was not satisfying to the fellows; the room <b>to</b> <b>store</b> the library was too small, the accommodation was insufficient {{and there was not}} enough room <b>to</b> <b>store</b> the museum at all. As a result, the museum was handed to the British Museum in 1781 and the library was extended to two rooms, one of which was used for council meetings.|$|E

5|$|Several {{other rooms}} {{neighbored}} the sanctuary. Many of these rooms were used <b>to</b> <b>store</b> ceremonial equipment, ritual texts, or temple valuables; others had specific ritual functions. The room where offerings {{were given to}} the deity was often separate from the sanctuary itself, and in temples without a barque in the sanctuary, there was a separate shrine <b>to</b> <b>store</b> the barque. In late temples the ritual areas could extend to chapels on the roof and crypts below the floor. Finally, in the exterior wall {{at the back of the}} temple, there were often niches for laymen to pray to the temple god, as close as they could come to its dwelling place.|$|E

5|$|A MOS Technology 6502 {{chip that}} {{operates}} at 894kHz generates the sound effects, and a speech synthesizer by Votrax generates Q*bert's incoherent expressions.

5|$|All nuthatches appear <b>to</b> <b>store</b> food, {{especially}} seeds, in tree crevices, in the ground, under small stones, {{or behind}} bark flakes, and these caches are remembered {{for as long}} as 30 days. Similarly, the rock nuthatches wedge snails into suitable crevices for consumption in times of need. European nuthatches have been found to avoid using their caches during benign conditions in order to save them for harsher times.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{bay bolete}} is {{predominantly}} a mycorrhizal species, {{it does have}} some saprophytic tendencies and {{may be able to}} use this lifestyle in certain circumstances. The ectomycorrhizae formed between I.badia and spruce (Picea abies) have active hyphal sheaths and a higher potential <b>to</b> <b>store</b> nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc than other mycorrhizal types, indicating the fungus is well adapted to acidic stands and its mycorrhizae are very efficient in uptake and storage of macronutrients.
