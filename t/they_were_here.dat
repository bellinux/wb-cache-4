5|$|The {{witnesses}} took {{ten hours}} to testify, {{during which time}} the court sat continuously. After a short break, the judge began his summing up, taking two hours to charge the jury. The judge urged the jury to put their prejudice at hearing that Thornton had sex with Ashford out of their heads; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>here</b> to determine if Thornton was guilty of the offence charged. He pointed out to the jury the lack of concealment exhibited by Thornton, his admission of the sexual act and of being with Ashford until 4a.m. The judge told them {{it was not possible}} for Thornton to have committed the acts alleged by the prosecution and still have made it to the Holden farm {{by the time he was}} seen by Heydon, and stressed that Thornton did not act like a man who ran. The judge concluded by reminding the jury that it was better a murderer go free than an innocent man be convicted.|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of August 16, the weather cleared, and Stark ordered his men {{to be ready to}} attack. Stark is reputed to have rallied his troops by saying <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>here</b> to fight for their [...] "natural born rights as Englishmen" [...] and he added [...] "There are your enemies, the Red Coats and the Tories. They are ours, or this night Molly Stark sleeps a widow." [...] Upon hearing that the militia had melted away into the woods, Baum assumed that the Americans were retreating or redeploying. However, Stark had decided to capitalize on weaknesses in the German's widely distributed position, and had sent sizable flanking parties to either side of his lines. These movements were assisted by a ruse employed by Stark's men that enabled them to get closer safely without alarming the opposing forces. The Germans, most of whom spoke no English, had been told that soldiers with bits of white paper in their hat were Loyalists, and should not be fired on; Stark's men had also heard this and many of them had suitably adorned their hats.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{told the}} United States Secret Service he rented the Hyatt hotel room at Adolf's request {{and that he}} {{believed}} [...] "without a doubt" [...] that Adolf came to Denver to kill Obama. According to a police affidavit, [...] "Johnson said the only reason for such killing would be because Obama is black." [...] During an August 25 interview with KCNC-TV, a CBS owned-and-operated television station in Denver, Johnson first denied being personally involved with the plot and, when asked whether he felt the men had serious plans {{to go through with}} the assassination, he said, [...] "Looking back at it, I don't want to say yes, but I don't want to say no." [...] Eventually, however, he admitted the other two men had planned a killing when he said, [...] "Yeah, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>here</b> to do that, to assassinate him ... it's about as hard for me to swallow as it is for you to understand." [...] Johnson said the plan was for Adolf to, [...] "shoot Obama from a high vantage point using a [...] sighted at 750 yards". Johnson said the shooting was to take place during Obama's acceptance speech on August 28 at the Democratic National Convention in INVESCO Field at Mile High. Johnson told the station, [...] "He don't belong in political office. Blacks don't belong in political office. He ought to be shot." ...|$|E

2500|$|Other {{characters}} are sourced from other Montgomery works. [...] The frequently seen characters of Rachel Lynde and Marilla Cuthbert were only briefly mentioned in passing in Chronicles of Avonlea—instead, they initially appeared as full-fledged characters in Montgomery's debut novel Anne of Green Gables. [...] (These characters had also previously {{been featured in}} Sullivan's 1985 television adaptation of the novel. [...] <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>here</b> played by the same actors, Patricia Hamilton and Colleen Dewhurst, who played {{the characters in the}} telefilm.)

2500|$|Game and {{hardware}} developers were more positive towards the Switch, seeing {{the system as}} [...] "a more unifying experience between their handheld and console divisions", but expressed concern on unanswered hardware specifications, and how Nintendo would market the unit to draw in developers. About half of 4,500 developers interviewed in a January 2017 survey believed that the Switch would outsell the Wii U. Ubisoft managing director Xavier Poix noted that unlike the Wii U, Nintendo had demonstrated a clear concept of enabling continuity, stating that [...] "The way it changes the way you play doesn't come necessarily with the controllers, because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>here</b> with the Wii as well ... but {{in the way it}} is mobile." [...] Phil Spencer, head of Microsoft's Xbox division, said he was impressed with Nintendo's ability to [...] "state a bold vision and build a product that delivers on that vision".|$|E
2500|$|Quantrill {{himself said}} that his {{motivation}} for the attack was [...] "to plunder, and destroy the town in retaliation for Osceola." [...] That was {{a reference to the}} Union's attack on Osceola, Missouri in September 1861, led by Senator James H. Lane. Osceola was plundered and nine men were given a drumhead court-martial trial and executed. Several other Missouri towns and large swaths of the Missouri countryside had been similarly plundered and burned by Unionist forces from Kansas. Castel (1999) concludes that revenge was the primary motive, followed by a desire to plunder. The retaliatory nature of the attack on Lawrence was confirmed by the survivors. [...] "The universal testimony of all the ladies and others who talked with the butchers of the 21st ult. is that these demons claimed <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>here</b> to revenge the wrongs done their families by our men under Lane, Jennison, Anthony and Co." ...|$|E
