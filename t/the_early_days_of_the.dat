He hoped for an independent command, but his desires were thwarted in two instances: Lee chose Lt. Gen. Jubal Early to lead an expedition north through the Shenandoah Valley and threaten Washington, and Davis chose Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood to replace the faltering Joseph E. Johnston in the Atlanta Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Bridging the {{age when}} gods lived alone and {{the age when}} divine {{interference}} in human affairs was limited was a transitional age in which gods and mortals moved together. These were <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world when the groups mingled more freely than they did later. Most of these tales were later told by Ovid's Metamorphoses and they are often divided into two thematic groups: tales of love, and tales of punishment.|$|E
5|$|By the 1880s, punishments also {{included}} a restricted diet of bread and water (for a short time span), time in irons, and a lengthening of a prisoner's sentence by a visiting magistrate. The cat o' nine tails, which had been used since <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prison, was abolished during the post-1911 Royal Commission reforms.

5|$|Football kit {{has evolved}} {{significantly}} since <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sport when players typically wore thick cotton shirts, knickerbockers and heavy rigid leather boots.

With the rise of advertising in the 20th century, sponsors' logos began to appear on shirts, and replica strips were made available for fans to purchase, generating significant amounts of revenue for clubs.|$|E
