5|$|In Reformed theology, sacraments {{are held}} to be, along with the word of God preached, the means of grace. In <b>the</b> <b>sacraments,</b> God graciously condescends to use common {{material}} objects to communicate divine promises to people. The grace promised consists not only in benefits which God bestows on people, but Christ's person himself, to whom God unites the believer. Sacraments confirm or ratify the promises communicated in preaching. Both preaching and <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> are not merely symbolic and representative of the reality to which they refer, but actually create the reality of saving grace. <b>The</b> <b>sacraments</b> are made efficacious by the Holy Spirit in actually bringing into effect the promises signified in <b>the</b> <b>sacraments.</b> This efficacy is only beneficial, however, {{for those who have}} faith. The sacrament remains efficacious regardless of the recipient's response. Its effect is negative, resulting in judgement, for the faithless; while it confers Christ and his benefits for the faithful.|$|E
5|$|Scottish nineteenth-century Reformed theologian William Cunningham {{also sought}} to {{articulate}} a distinctively Reformed theology of baptism in the modern world. Cunningham preferred the writings of Zwingli on <b>the</b> <b>sacraments,</b> writing that Calvin and later Reformed orthodox theologians overly elevated the value of <b>the</b> <b>sacraments.</b> He argued that the efficacy of baptism only applies to adults expressing faith {{in the act of}} baptism.|$|E
5|$|According {{to church}} doctrine, <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> {{of the church}} require the proper form, matter, and intent to be validly {{celebrate}}d. In addition, the Canon Laws for both the Latin Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches govern who may licitly celebrate certain sacraments, as well as strict rules about who may receive <b>the</b> <b>sacraments.</b> Notably, because the Church teaches that Christ {{is present in the}} Eucharist, those who are conscious of being in a state of mortal sin are forbidden to receive the sacrament until they have received absolution through the sacrament of Reconciliation (Penance). Catholics are normally obliged to abstain from eating {{for at least an hour}} before receiving the sacrament. Non-Catholics such are ordinarily prohibited from receiving the Eucharist as well.|$|E
50|$|The Catholic Church {{sees the}} effects of <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> as follows: As <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> of Marriage gives grace for the married state, <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> of Anointing of the Sick gives grace for the state into which people enter through sickness. Through <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> a gift of the Holy Spirit is given, that renews {{confidence}} and faith in God and strengthens against temptations to discouragement, despair and anguish {{at the thought of}} death and the struggle of death; it prevents the believer from losing Christian hope in God's justice, truth and salvation. Because one of {{the effects of}} <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> is to absolve the recipient of any sins not previously absolved through <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> of penance, only an ordained priest or bishop may administer <b>the</b> <b>sacrament.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sacrament</b> of Penance and Reconciliation is {{also known}} as [...] "Penance", [...] "Reconciliation", and [...] "Confession". <b>The</b> <b>sacrament</b> has four elements: three {{on the part of the}} {{penitent}} (contrition, confession, and satisfaction) and one on the part of the minister of <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> (absolution).|$|R

5|$|All clergy, whether deacons, priests or bishops, may preach, teach, baptise, witness {{marriages and}} conduct funeral liturgies. Only bishops and priests can {{administer}} <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> of the Eucharist, Reconciliation (Penance) and Anointing of the Sick. Only bishops can administer {{the sacrament of}} Holy Orders, which ordains someone into the clergy.|$|E
5|$|Dioceses {{are divided}} into parishes, each {{with one or more}} priests, deacons or lay ecclesial ministers. Parishes are {{responsible}} for the day to day celebration of <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> and pastoral care of the laity. , there are 221,700 parishes worldwide.|$|E
5|$|A Canonical Coronation (Latin: Coronatam Canonicus): is a pious {{institutional}} {{act of the}} Pope, {{on behalf}} of a devotion. This tradition still stands in 2015, in 2014 Pope Francis crowned Our Lady of Immaculate Conception of Juquila. Since 1989, the act has been carried out through the authorised decree by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of <b>the</b> <b>Sacraments.</b>|$|E
50|$|A priest models Jesus as friend. Priests {{minister}} to families, preach and teach. They can also perform <b>the</b> <b>Sacrament</b> of Baptism, Administer <b>the</b> <b>Sacrament</b> of <b>the</b> Lord's Supper, and Solemnize and perform <b>the</b> <b>Sacrament</b> of Marriage.

They share with the elders the responsibility to explain all things concerning the church to those who have been baptized but yet to be confirmed.|$|R
5000|$|The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), {{the largest}} Lutheran Church in America, however, does not {{practice}} closed communion, but rather [...] "eucharistic hospitality." [...] In terms of guests receiving <b>the</b> <b>Sacrament,</b> {{according to this}} practice, the burden of decision of admittance to <b>the</b> <b>Sacrament</b> {{is not on the}} host congregation, but on its guests. The invitation to <b>the</b> <b>Sacrament</b> is extended to [...] "all baptized persons," [...] along with [...] "a brief written or oral statement in worship which teaches Christ's presence in the sacrament." [...] In terms of members receiving <b>the</b> <b>Sacrament,</b> reception of <b>the</b> <b>Sacrament</b> is always to include [...] "continuing catechesis which includes instruction for Holy Communion," [...] {{but this is not a}} prerequisite for first communion, and even infants may be permitted to receive <b>the</b> <b>Sacrament</b> at or after the service of their baptism.|$|R
50|$|When and how any {{particular}} Christian participates in <b>the</b> Christian <b>sacrament</b> of Eucharist, regardless of intellectual disability or cognitive capacity, {{depends on the}} way the administering Christian community understands <b>the</b> <b>sacrament.</b> Because there is a plurality of Christian accounts of Eucharist, there is a plurality of practices and traditions concerning the norms for participation in that case of a Christian who has an intellectual disability. Some Christian traditions maintain that a theological understanding of <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> is necessary to receive Eucharist and, therefore, do not administer <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> to intellectually disabled persons. Other Christian traditions maintain that spiritual devotion to the real presence of Jesus Christ is necessary to receive the Eucharist and, therefore, administer <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> to intellectually disabled persons under particular conditions--presuming the benefit of <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> can be received even if the Eucharist is not consumed. Still other Christian traditions understand the practice of Eucharist principally as an communal expression of community solidarity or unity and, therefore, administer <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> indiscriminately during <b>the</b> liturgy.|$|R
5|$|Among {{the most}} {{controversial}} areas of interpretation of John is its sacramental theology. Scholars' views have fallen along a wide spectrum ranging from anti-sacramental and non-sacramental, to sacramental, to ultra-sacramental and hyper-sacramental. Scholars disagree both on whether and how frequently John refers to <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> at all, and {{on the degree of}} importance he places upon them. Individual scholars' answers to one of these questions do not always correspond to their answer to the other.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} on the stronger-sacramental end of {{the spectrum}} assess <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> as being of great importance to the evangelist. However, perhaps counterintuitively, some scholars who find fewer sacramental references, such as Udo Schnelle, view the references that they find as highly important as well. Schnelle in particular views John's sacramentalism as a counter to Docetist anti-sacramentalism. On the other hand, though he agrees that there are anti-Docetic passages, James Dunn views the absence of a Eucharistic institution narrative as evidence for an anti-sacramentalism in John, meant to warn against a conception of eternal life as dependent on physical ritual.|$|E
5|$|The {{documentary}} {{was shot}} on 16mm colour film by cameraman John McGlashan, {{who had also}} worked on the BBC's M.R. James series of adaptations A Ghost Story for Christmas, of which the early installments were entirely filmed in Norfolk (Betjeman was a fan of Jamesian ghost stories, and often read them to the crew while travelling to locations). McGlashan was also a part-time priest for a Liberal Catholic church, {{and was able to}} bring to the production additional knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>Sacraments.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>sacrament</b> is {{considered}} <b>the</b> most sacred and {{important element of}} the Sunday meetings and as such is approached by Latter-day Saints with reverence and {{in a spirit of}} penitence. Consequently, all who partake of <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> are encouraged to examine their own consciences and prayerfully gauge their own worthiness to do so. If they feel unworthy, they are encouraged to refrain from participating in <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> until they have properly repented of their sins. Partaking of <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> by non-members and unbaptized members is permissible (except in cases were the person has been excommunicated by the church), but the unbaptized are regarded as not having part of the covenant associated with <b>the</b> <b>sacrament.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sacrament</b> of Penance is {{the first}} of two <b>sacraments</b> of healing. <b>The</b> Catechism of the Catholic Church {{mentions}} in the following order and capitalization different names of <b>the</b> <b>sacrament,</b> calling it <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> of conversion, Penance, confession, forgiveness and Reconciliation. It is <b>the</b> <b>sacrament</b> of spiritual healing of a baptized person from the distancing from God resulting from sins committed. When people sin after baptism, they cannot have baptism as a remedy; Baptism, which is a spiritual regeneration, cannot be given a second time.|$|R
2500|$|In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), <b>the</b> [...] "Holy <b>Sacrament</b> of <b>the</b> Lord's Supper", {{more simply}} {{referred}} to as <b>the</b> <b>Sacrament,</b> is administered every Sunday (except General Conference or other special Sunday meeting) in each LDS Ward or branch worldwide at <b>the</b> beginning of <b>Sacrament</b> meeting. <b>The</b> <b>Sacrament,</b> which consists of both ordinary bread and water (rather than wine or grape juice), is prepared by priesthood holders prior {{to the beginning of}} the meeting. At the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>Sacrament,</b> priests say specific prayers to bless the bread and water. <b>The</b> <b>Sacrament</b> is passed row-by-row to the congregation by priesthood holders (typically deacons).|$|R
5|$|The term baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{originates}} in the New Testament, and all Christian traditions {{accept it as}} a theological concept. Nevertheless, different Christian denominations and traditions have interpreted its meaning {{in a variety of}} ways due to differences in the doctrines of salvation and ecclesiology. As a result, Spirit baptism has been variously defined as part of <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> of initiation into the church, as being synonymous with regeneration, as being synonymous with Christian perfection, or as being a second work of grace that empowers a person for Christian life and service.|$|E
5|$|At an {{ecclesiastical council}} held at Lambeth in 1281, Peckham ordered the clergy to {{instruct}} their congregations in doctrine {{at least four}} times a year. They were to explain and teach the Articles of Faith, the Ten Commandments, the Works of Mercy, the Seven Deadly Sins, the Seven Virtues and <b>the</b> <b>Sacraments.</b> This command was issued as a canon, or law, of the council, and the group is known as the Lambeth Constitutions. Even later these constitutions were collected as the Ignorantia sacerdotum. The six doctrines comprised the minimum theological knowledge the archbishop considered necessary for the laity to know. The constitutions, which were originally in Latin, were the basis and inspiration for pastoral and devotional works throughout the remainder of the Middle Ages, and were eventually translated into English in the 15th century.|$|E
5|$|Debate {{on church}} {{officers}} began on 19 October. The Assembly {{began with the}} issue of ordination, as many of the divines were concerned about the rise of various sectarian movements and the lack of any mechanism for ordination of ministers of the established church. While some members did not seem to think ordination necessary for preachers (though they should not administer <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> without it), a majority of the divines thought any regular preaching without ordination unacceptable and wished to erect a provisional presbytery for purposes of ordination. There was also debate at this early stage over the nature of the visible church. The congregationalists considered a church to be a single local congregation, while the majority considered the national church to be a unity and were alarmed at the prospect of a disintegrated English church. Despite these debates, up until the end of 1643 there was hope that a common church government could be framed that would be satisfactory to all parties involved.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of what they {{suspected}} would be the general engagement, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg sought out the field chaplain, and requested <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> because, as he told his aide, anything can happen during a battle. Although Ostrach had been a hard-fought battle, at Engen and Stockach, the Austrian and French forces were far more concentrated—more men in a smaller space—than they had been at Ostrach, where the French forces in particular had been stretched thinly on a long line from Lake Constance to north of the Danube. At Stockach, furthermore, Jourdan had all his troops under his direct control, {{with the possible exception}} of Dominique Vandamme, who was maneuvering his small force of cavalry and light infantry into position to attempt a flanking action on the far right Austrian flank.|$|E
5|$|Twentieth-century Reformed theologian Karl Barth did {{not follow}} the Reformed belief that sacraments are used by God as means of grace. Instead, he saw the Lord's Supper as purely {{symbolic}} and functioning to proclaim God's promises. His position has been called symbolic memorialism because he saw <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> function as memorializing Christ's death. Another twentieth-century Reformed theologian, Donald Baillie, took a position {{similar to that of}} John Calvin. Baillie argued that though God is omnipresent, he is present in a special way in the Lord's Supper because he is present by virtue of the believer's faith. Christ's presence is even more real to the believer in the sacrament than is physical reality.|$|E
5|$|The Congregation elected Vermigli abbot of {{the monastery}} at San Pietro ad Aram, Naples in 1537. There he became acquainted with Juan de Valdés, {{a leader of the}} spirituali movement. Valdés {{introduced}} Vermigli to the writings of Protestant reformers. Toward the end of his time in Naples, he read Martin Bucer's commentaries on the Gospels and the Psalms, and Zwingli's De vera et falsa religione. Reading these works was an act of ecclesiastical defiance, but not an uncommon one in reformist circles. Vermigli seems to have slowly moved in a Protestant direction primarily through study of the Bible and the Church Fathers, especially Augustine. He probably read Protestant literature critically; it was common for those in reform-minded circles to do so while remaining in the Catholic Church. Vermigli embraced the Protestant doctrine of justification by faith alone during this time, and he had probably rejected the traditional Catholic view of <b>the</b> <b>sacraments.</b> Vermigli also seems to have influenced Valdés. Scholars believe that Valdés's strong doctrine of double predestination, that God has chosen some people for salvation and others for damnation, was learned from Vermigli. Vermigli in turn had acquired it from his study of Gregory of Rimini at Padua.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese {{refused to}} {{recognise}} Bishop de Castro's appointment and vigorously opposed his activities. Archbishop Brandão's sudden death on 6 July 1678 further complicated matters, and the Cathedral chapter administering the Archdiocese of Goa following the vacancy created by his death, forbade the Canara Catholics from receiving <b>the</b> <b>sacraments</b> from the bishop or from priests appointed by him. In his turn, Bishop de Castro excommunicated those Catholics who were obedient to the Padroado authorities in Goa and their priests. In 1681, the Holy See appointed another Goan priest Fr. Joseph Vaz, as the Vicar Forane of Canara; {{he was asked}} not to submit to Bishop de Castro unless he showed the letter of appointment. However, after being convinced of its legitimacy, Fr. Vaz submitted to Bishop de Castro and brought about a truce. He further managed to persuade the bishop to delegate his jurisdiction to him while retaining the post. In 1700, the Catholics of Canara were again brought {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Padroado Archbishop of Goa.|$|E
5|$|Legatine councils in 1125, 1127 and 1129 {{were held}} in Westminster, the last two called by Archbishop William. The council of 1125 met under the {{direction}} of John of Crema and prohibited simony, purchase of <b>the</b> <b>sacraments,</b> and the inheritance of clerical benefices. John of Crema had been sent to England not only to seek a compromise in the Canterbury–York dispute, but to publicize the decrees of the First Council of the Lateran held in 1123, which neither William nor Thurstan had attended. Included in canons were the rejection of hereditary claims to a benefice or prebend, which was a source of consternation to the clergy. Also prohibited was the presence of any women in clergy's households unless they were relatives. In 1127 the council condemned the purchase of benefices, priesthoods, or places in monastic houses. It also enacted canons declaring that clergy who refused to give up their wives or concubines would be deprived of their benefices, and that any such women who did not leave the parish where they had been could be expelled and even forced into slavery. Lastly, in 1129 the clergy were once more admonished to live a celibate life and to put aside their wives. This council was presided over by King Henry, who then undermined the force of the prohibition of concubines by permitting the clergy to pay a fine to the royal treasury to keep their women. William's allowance of this royal fine was condemned by the chronicler Henry of Huntingdon. The festival of the Conception was also allowed at one of these councils.|$|E
