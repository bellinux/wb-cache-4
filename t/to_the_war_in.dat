5|$|Though Operation Irma {{was widely}} publicized, and was {{reported}} in September 1993 to have raised £1 million in donations to evacuate the wounded from Sarajevo, it attracted a number of criticisms. These addressed the operation's limited scale, the motives of the British press and foreign governments in launching the airlifts, the devotion of resources to evacuation instead of supplying material support to local medical services, and the broader issue of the United Kingdom's response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> Bosnia.|$|E

5|$|When World War I {{broke out}} in 1914, Khrushchev was exempt from {{conscription}} {{because he was a}} skilled metal worker. He was employed by a workshop that serviced ten mines, and he was involved in several strikes that demanded higher pay, better working conditions, and an end <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> <b>In</b> 1914, he married Yefrosinia Pisareva, daughter of the elevator operator at the Rutchenkovo mine.

5|$|While the {{tensions}} between NATO members from the build-up to the invasion of Iraq had dissipated, the NATO summit, and the months preceding the summit, were marked by divisions between the United States and the United Kingdom {{on the one side}} and France, Germany, Italy and Spain on the other.

5|$|As the American Civil War approached, Colt {{supplied}} {{both the}} North and the South with firearms. He {{had been known}} to sell weapons to warring parties {{on both sides of}} other conflicts in Europe and saw no difference with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> America. In 1859 Colt considered building an armory in the South and as late as 1861 had sold 2,000 revolvers to Confederate agent John Forsyth. Although trade with the South had not been restricted at that time, newspapers such as the New York Daily Tribune, the New York Times and the Hartford Daily Courant labeled him a Southern sympathizer and traitor to the Union. In response to these charges, Colt was commissioned as a colonel by the state of Connecticut on May 16, 1861, in the 1st Regiment Colts Revolving Rifles of Connecticut armed with the Colt revolving rifle. Colt envisioned this unit as being staffed by men over six feet tall and armed with his weapons. However, the unit never took the field and Colt was discharged on June 20, 1861.|$|E

In 2004, production was announced that the first follow-up would be produced for a theatrical film release in 2006, The Queen; that dramatises the weeks following the death of Princess Diana on 31 August 1997.

5|$|From late 2001, Hercules began {{flying into}} Afghanistan {{to support the}} SAS {{squadron}} deployed as part of Operation Slipper, Australia's contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> Afghanistan. Five Hercules of Nos.36 and 37 Squadrons joined relief efforts following the Bali Bombings in October 2002. In February 2003, a detachment of Hercules from No.36 Squadron was deployed to the Middle East {{as part of the}} Australian contribution to the invasion of Iraq. These aircraft arrived on 10February, and began flying transport sorties twelve days later. The C-130s were the main form of transport used to move Australian personnel and equipment in the theatre before and after the outbreak of fighting on 19March. During the invasion the Hercules supported SAS operations in western Iraq, one being the first Coalition aircraft to land at Al Asad Airbase after it was secured by special forces personnel on 12April. The C-130s transported supplies and equipment to airstrips in southern Iraq to support the operations of US and British forces. As {{the first phase of the}} war wound down, Australian Hercules flew medical supplies into Baghdad shortly after the city was captured. A rotating detachment of three Hercules was subsequently maintained in the Middle East to support the ongoing Australian contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> Afghanistan, as well as the forces stationed in Iraq. The aircraft assigned to this detachment amassed a total of 20,000operational flying hours by March 2010. An American contractor travelling on an Australian C-130 in Iraq was killed on 27June 2004 when the aircraft was struck by gunfire shortly after it took off from Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, when Germany {{attacked}} Great Britain, the United States {{feared that}} if Germany controlled Great Britain, Mexico and the U.S. would be next. In the same year, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ordered {{the construction of}} a naval base in the Atlantic similar to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. The site was meant to provide anchorage, docking, repair facilities, fuel, and supplies for 60% of the Atlantic Fleet. The naval base, which was named U.S. Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, became the largest naval installation in the world in landmass and was meant to be the Pearl Harbor of the Atlantic. However, with the defeat of Germany in 1945, the United States concentrated all of their efforts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> the Pacific. In May 2003, after six decades of existence, the base was officially shut down by the U.S. Navy.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{election}} campaign the parties positions on foreign relations and <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> Donbass could be roughly divided into two groups. The first group consisted of pro-European parties that advocated <b>to</b> end <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> Donbass by use of force and consisted of Fatherland Party, Civic Position, Radical Party and People's Front (this party was ambiguous about use of force). Svoboda also wanted <b>to</b> end <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> Donbass by use of force. The party Petro Poroshenko Bloc was the only pro-European party that wanted <b>to</b> end <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> Donbass by a peaceful solution. The second group was Strong Ukraine and Opposition Bloc who were considered pro-Russian and they advocated <b>to</b> end <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> Donbass by a peaceful solution.

5|$|Once air-to-air combat began over North Vietnam, the Air Force {{was again}} found lacking. The {{mainstay}} missiles {{of the air}} war {{turned out to be}} the Navy-developed AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow, not its own AIM-4 Falcon. The Air Force continuously opposed adapting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> Southeast Asia, since its leadership believed that it was an aberration that would be quickly resolved. It could then turn its attention (and its more modern weapons) against the greater threat posed by the Soviet Union. None in the Air Force high command foresaw that the war would drag on for nearly a decade.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{organized}} {{as a part}} of the 95th Infantry Division for World War I, the brigade never saw combat in that conflict. Kept active and in the reserve through much of the 20th century, the brigade in name was reorganized into a different unit for fighting during World War II. Seeing numerous moves, activations and deactivations, the brigade has been used principally as a training unit for most of its existence. Reactivated again in 2006, the brigade is now primarily responsible for training provincial reconstruction teams and their supporting elements for deployment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Tensions {{came to a}} {{head over}} the {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> France. While the court party preferred negotiations, Gaunt and Buckingham urged a large-scale campaign to protect English possessions. Instead, a so-called crusade led by Henry le Despenser, Bishop of Norwich, was dispatched, which failed miserably. Faced with this setback on the continent, Richard turned his attention instead towards France's ally, Scotland. In 1385, the king himself led a punitive expedition to the north, but the effort came to nothing, and the army had to return without ever engaging the Scots in battle. Meanwhile, only an uprising in Ghent prevented a French invasion of southern England. The relationship between Richard and his uncle John of Gaunt deteriorated further with military failure, and John of Gaunt left England to pursue his claim to the throne of Castile in 1386 amid rumours of a plot against his person. With Gaunt gone, the unofficial leadership of the growing dissent against the king and his courtiers passed to Buckinghamwho had by now been created Duke of Gloucesterand Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel.|$|E

5|$|The Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement was not {{successful}} in ending the war, and fighting resumed in September 1999. The FAC's performance {{continued to be}} poor and both the major offensives the Government launched in 2000 ended in costly defeats. President Kabila's mismanagement was an important factor behind the FAC's poor performance, with soldiers frequently going unpaid and unfed while the Government purchased advanced weaponry {{which could not be}} operated or maintained. The defeats in 2000 are believed to have been the cause of President Kabila's assassination in January 2001. Following the assassination, Joseph Kabila assumed the presidency and was eventually successful in negotiating an end <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> 2002-2003.|$|E
5|$|The first {{operational}} {{deployment of}} RAAF Hornets {{took place in}} 2001. Following the 11 September terrorist attacks, the Australian Government agreed to deploy F/A-18s to protect the major USAF air base on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, which was being used to mount operations in Afghanistan. Four No.77 Squadron Hornets and 70 personnel departed for the island on 9 November. No.3 Squadron pilots and ground crew relieved the No.77 Squadron personnel in early February 2002. RAAF Hornets were not assigned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> <b>in</b> Afghanistan as {{at the time they}} were less capable than other available coalition aircraft. While the F/A-18s were occasionally scrambled in response to reports of aircraft near the base, no threat developed. The detachment returned to Australia on 21 May 2002.|$|E
5|$|The main {{guns were}} to be built by Skoda, and while the battleships {{themselves}} were never laid down, the guns for one battleship had been ordered prior {{to the beginning of}} World War I. These were the only orders that the Austro-Hungarian Navy had placed for any part of the four battleships. It was assumed that following a victorious conclusion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> just two months, work on the battleships would resume. As the war continued, four of the main guns that were ordered from the Skoda works were handed over to the Austro-Hungarian Army for use on the Italian Front. The rest of the completed main guns were later taken by the French as a war prize following the end of the war. In late 1917, the construction on all four vessels was canceled.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} the {{campaign}} against the Dutch squadron in the East Indies allowed British forces in the Indian Ocean to focus exclusively on the French islands of Île Bonaparte and Isle de France, which proved very difficult to subdue during the ensuing Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811. Freedom of movement for British forces in the East Indies proved invaluable however: on 27 January 1807, Peter Rainier in Caroline had seized a Spanish ship San Raphael carrying over half a million Spanish dollars and an exceptionally valuable cargo, {{and the ability of}} British commerce raiders to act against French, Spanish and Dutch merchant shipping in the region was assured. When Pellew's successor Rear-Admiral William O'Bryen Drury attempted to eliminate the Dutch East Indies islands in a series of large scale invasions during 1810 and 1811, British naval movements were completely unopposed, allowing a rapid and successful conclusion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> the Pacific.|$|E

5|$|Many castles still {{retained}} a defensive role. Castles in England, such as Chepstow and York Castle, were repaired and garrisoned by the king. As military technologies progressed {{the costs of}} upgrading older castles could be prohibitive – the estimated £30,000 required for the potential conversion of York in 1682, approximately £4,050,000 in 2009 terms, gives a scale of the potential costs. Castles played a minimal role in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, although some fortifications such as Dover Castle were attacked by mobs unhappy with the religious beliefs of their Catholic governors, and the sieges of King John's Castle in Limerick formed part of the endgame <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> Ireland. In the north of Britain security problems persisted in Scotland. Cromwellian forces had built {{a number of new}} modern forts and barracks, but the royal castles of Edinburgh, Dumbarton and Stirling, along with Dunstaffnage, Dunollie and Ruthven Castle, also continued in use as practical fortifications. Tower houses were being built up until the 1640s; after the Restoration the fortified tower house fell out of fashion, but the weak state of the Scottish economy was such that while many larger properties were simply abandoned, the more modest castles continued to be used and adapted as houses, rather than rebuilt. In Ireland tower houses and castles remained in use until after the Glorious Revolution, when events led to a dramatic shift in land ownership and a boom in the building of Palladian country houses; in many cases using timbers stripped from the older, abandoned generation of castles and tower houses.|$|E
