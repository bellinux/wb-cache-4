5|$|Published on September 22, 2015, {{the fourth}} book, A Shiloh Christmas, was {{published}} by Atheneum, which printed 200,000 copies. A ferocious drought strikes Marty's community, and a new pastor joins blaming remorseless sinners for instigating it. Looking for a scapegoat, community members lie the responsibility squarely on people like Judd, an alcoholic and animal abuser who has reformed. A fire ravages multiple houses, including Judd's, prompting Marty and his family to help <b>the</b> <b>homeowners</b> reconstruct their homes. One day, Marty and a friend stumble upon Rachel, the pastor's daughter, confined to the pastor's toolshed. The incident forces Marty's parents {{to determine whether the}} disciplinary action has crossed the line from being disciplinary to being abusive. The book ends with characters who have vehemently differing views having a therapeutic Christmas meal together.|$|E
25|$|In 1950, INA invented {{what became}} the most {{successful}} of all multiple-line policies: <b>the</b> <b>homeowners</b> policy. <b>The</b> <b>homeowners</b> policy combined into one policy various kinds of fire, theft, and liability insurance that previously insurance companies had only offered separately. It was soon INA's most popular and most imitated product. In 1951, the U.S. insurance industry wrote $777,000 in premiums on the policy, all by INA; by 1960, it wrote $750 million.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, Bermudian Springs School District {{approved}} 3,603 homestead properties received $169. The {{increase in}} amount {{was due to}} {{a decrease in the}} number of <b>the</b> <b>homeowners</b> receiving relief in the District.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} benefit to <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> is <b>the</b> {{prevention}} of foreclosure because loss mitigation works to either relieve <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> of <b>the</b> debt {{or create a}} mortgage resolution that is financially sustainable for <b>the</b> <b>homeowner.</b> Lenders benefit by mitigating the losses they would incur through foreclosing on <b>the</b> <b>homeowner.</b> Immediate foreclosure creates a tremendous financial burden on the lender.|$|R
50|$|Rescue artists {{arrange the}} closing (often delaying the date until shortly before <b>the</b> <b>homeowner's</b> removal to create urgency). At <b>the</b> closing, <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> {{transfers}} title (possibly unwittingly) {{to the rescue}} artist or an arranged investor. The rescue artist or arranged investor pays off the amount owed in foreclosure to acquire the deed, and inherits or is paid any portion of <b>the</b> <b>homeowner's</b> remaining equity. <b>The</b> rescue artist will reconvey the property back to <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> in <b>the</b> form of a lease or a contract for deed.|$|R
50|$|Take {{for example}} {{a house that}} was {{purchased}} for $160,000 but is now worth $100,000 due to the market decline. Further, assume <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> owes $120,000 on the mortgage. In this scenario, the loan-to-value ratio would be 120%, and if <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> chose to refinance, he {{would also have to}} pay for private mortgage insurance. If <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> were not already paying for PMI, the added cost could nullify much of the benefit of refinancing, so <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> could be effectively prohibited from refinancing.|$|R
25|$|Today, Atchison Village is a {{collection}} of privately owned houses managed by a cooperative of <b>the</b> <b>homeowners.</b> While most of the dormitories and other low income housing of World War II are gone, Atchison Village, built as permanent housing, remains.|$|E
25|$|In February 2015, Wells Fargo {{agreed to}} pay $4 million for {{violations}} where an affiliate took interest {{in the homes of}} borrowers in exchange for opening credit card accounts for <b>the</b> <b>homeowners.</b> This is illegal according to New York credit card laws. There was a $2 million penalty with the other $2 million going towards restitution to customers.|$|E
25|$|Shaky Foundation - In {{the sixth}} season debut, Mike and crew {{arrive at a}} new home at which <b>the</b> <b>homeowners</b> had {{discovered}} that the foundation concrete was woefully weak— as little as one-third of the minimum code requirement— and which had slipped past the building inspectors, who had only compared the weak foundation wall concrete {{to that of the}} foundation floor (without considering that the floor may have also been weak).|$|E
5000|$|The scheme {{has created}} a number of {{start-up}} companies providing free electricity [...] in return for installing solar panels on <b>the</b> <b>homeowner's</b> roof. If <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> {{can not afford the}} capital outlay, the free solar companies offer a capital-free way of getting the benefits of solar and free electricity. However, if <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> can afford <b>the</b> capital outlay it is more cost effective to purchase the solar equipment directly.|$|R
50|$|One may compare {{a reverse}} {{mortgage}} with a conventional mortgage, where <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> makes a monthly payment to the lender, and after each payment, <b>the</b> <b>homeowner's</b> equity increases {{by the amount}} of the principal included in the payment.|$|R
50|$|When refinancing, if <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> {{wants to}} refinance the first {{mortgage}} {{and keep the}} second mortgage, <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> has to request a subordination from the second lender to let the new first lender step into the first lien holder position.|$|R
25|$|There are {{typically}} a First and a Second Mortgage. The Second Mortgage {{is put in}} place to protect any equity that is left that is not captured in the first mortgage. <b>The</b> <b>homeowners</b> pay down the first mortgage, and after a stated period of time (which varies from affiliate to affiliate) of living in the same home, the Second Mortgage is forgiven (however, it is not always forgiven). However, The Right of First Refusal stays in force until the mortgage is paid in full.|$|E
25|$|Up {{until the}} early 20th century, it was mainly visited by the European royals and elites, {{including}} Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany and Empress Elisabeth of Austria; today it is also widely visited by middle class families (primarily from the UK, Scandinavia and Germany). With {{the advent of the}} jet airliner bringing these groups relatively affordable 'package holidays', Corfu was one of the primary destinations for this new form of mass tourism. It is still popular with the ultra-wealthy however, and in the island's northeast <b>the</b> <b>homeowners</b> include members of the Rothschild family and Russian oligarchs.|$|E
25|$|The DIA is an {{organization}} mandated in the Deerwood deed covenants, composed of elected Deerwood homeowners, {{all of whom are}} automatically association members. As part of Gate's sale of Deerwood in 1999, ownership of the common areas was transferred to the DIA. At that time, the DIA automatic membership did not include voting rights, which were offered for a one-time fee of $3,000 and were transferrable if the member's property was sold. Nearly two-thirds of <b>the</b> <b>homeowners</b> purchased this benefit, all but 84 of these homeowners paid the $9,000 Equity Fee plus the $3,000 fee to join the Club.|$|E
30|$|Scenario 3 : <b>The</b> <b>homeowner</b> owns <b>the</b> {{appliances}} in {{a building}} {{but he is not}} living in the building. Instead, he rents the rooms out to different tenants who do not want <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> to track their energy use, in consideration of privacy protection.|$|R
50|$|The Southampton Civic Club Inc. is <b>the</b> <b>homeowner's</b> association.|$|R
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{arrangement is}} where vacation rental managers provide homeowners with a guaranteed rental. Under these arrangements vacation rental managers buy all of <b>the</b> weeks <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> wishes to rent {{in a single}} transaction. This provides <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> with guaranteed income, and puts the risk and management burden on the rental manager.|$|R
25|$|Another large {{presence}} in the city is the Crystal Lake Park District, which runs all of the city's numerous parks and the yearly events which take place within them. Two major parks run by the park district are Veterans Acres, along Walkup Road, and Main Beach, along with the namesake Crystal Lake. Crystal Lake is open whenever the weather is accommodating. However, boating is often restricted due to disputes with both <b>the</b> <b>homeowners</b> on the lake and the village of Lakewood, in which approximately 30% of the lake lies. The Crystal Lake Rowing Club has a boathouse in Kamijima Park, on {{the west end of}} Crystal Lake, and rows on the lake during the no-wake hours (usually early mornings and early evenings). In Crystal Lake lies the famed Dole mansion, where visitors can take tours for a small donation.|$|E
25|$|Maxis {{went public}} in 1995 with revenue of US$38 million. The stock reached $50 a share and then dropped as Maxis posted a loss. EA bought Maxis in June 1997. Wright had been {{thinking}} about making a virtual doll house ever since the early 1990s, similar to SimCity but focused on individual people; after losing his home during the Oakland firestorm of 1991, he was inspired to turn his experiences of rebuilding his life into a game. Sims would be based on Wright's focus on building homes, which came from inspiration he found first-hand. Wright, was even sure to include many fires in the game, which were extra difficult for the player to extinguish. Themes like carpentry, home construction, and bare ground in need of landscaping, are common throughout the game. Originally conceived of as an architectural design game called Home Tactics, Wright's idea changed when someone suggested the player should be rated on the quality of life experience by <b>the</b> <b>homeowners.</b> It was a difficult idea to sell to EA, because already 40% of Maxis's employees had been laid off.|$|E
500|$|According to city {{commissioner}} Adams, a cheaper alternative {{which would have}} changed the tower's designs to a lattice style used in electrical transmission towers, was not considered because the result would look like an [...] "ugly ski lift at a bad ski resort" [...] and leave the city with what Adams called an [...] "ugly postcard" [...] that could last 100years. Critics of the tram have also expressed concern over the tram's spoiling views for <b>the</b> <b>homeowners</b> from the city's West Hills, particularly from Gibbs Street, under the tram.|$|E

500|$|In May 2010, on 301 N. Granger Street, the 1895 home of city {{bricklayer}} {{and early}} proprietor Robert King {{was set to}} be demolished. <b>The</b> <b>homeowners</b> donated it to Saline County Habitat for Humanity last year hoping that the organization {{might be able to}} restore it. The home was considered [...] "unrestorable". In 2012, Harrisburg High School was placed on the Landmark Illinois endangered buildings list. Two seniors at Harrisburg High School were preparing a nomination of the building for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, and they helped to distribute a petition through social media in order to help save the school.|$|E
500|$|The {{gardens and}} {{outbuildings}} {{of the property}} were designed to Fletcher Steele's vision of what colonial garden should be. [...] He drew on ideas seen in the gardens of George Washington's estate at Mount Vernon to design a property where [...] "a hundred forms of industry were carried on". Rows of vegetables, fruit trees, and bushes, were lined with flowers for aesthetic appeal, and spaces for carved out that he envisioned would {{have been used for}} performing outdoor work such as chopping wood, churning butter, and preparing preserves. [...] Echoing statements made in his Design of a Little Garden, published just a few years earlier, Steele laid out the outbuildings in such a way to provide <b>the</b> <b>homeowners</b> a private retreat.|$|E
500|$|Shroeder confronts Gogolak, {{accusing him}} of trying to kill his family. Instead Schroeder is told [...] "Rob Petrie" [...] is the real problem. Meanwhile, Mulder {{believes}} the creature that kills <b>the</b> <b>homeowners</b> moves through the yard, under the grass. Scully shares her lab results: the [...] "blood" [...] on the ceiling fan and on the dog is actually grime, as the neighborhood is built {{on top of an}} old landfill. Mulder believes the Klines were buried in their yard, so the next day he gets a backhoe to dig up the front yard, telling the neighbors he's putting in a reflecting pool, which is not against the community rules. They don't find the Klines, but they do find the tacky windmill that had been mysteriously delivered to the Klines before they died. The windmill bears a label from Gogolak's company.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>homeowner</b> arrives to see {{his house}} in shambles and accidentally undoes the Stooges' {{convoluted}} repair work. As {{they are about to}} reprimand him, it becomes clear that <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> happens to be the judge who found them innocent a few hours earlier and The Judge, his butler and The police go after the Stooges.|$|R

50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> calls <b>the</b> {{house and}} reports that he's {{returning}} early, the two rush everyone out {{and clean up}} the mess left during the party. When <b>the</b> <b>homeowner</b> returns, <b>the</b> two men point out all the work they've done around his house in his absence, then offer to watch the house again if the opportunity arises again.|$|R
500|$|The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) {{abandoned}} the Rockaway Beach Branch in 1962, {{and ever since}} it has been sought after for reactivation for train service. The line hasn't been reactivated due to local opposition, specifically <b>the</b> <b>homeowners</b> who live along the right-of-way. One group wants the line's reactivation for transit service. A second group would use the right-of-way as a linear park, known as the Queensway, a proposal inspired {{by the success of}} the High Line in Manhattan. The final group involving homeowners would have nothing done, keeping the line as is. Most plans call for the line to be used for subway service, with the line being connected to the south with the IND Rockaway Line. Talks of reactivating the line were publicly endorsed in February 2012 by Assemblymen Phillip Goldfeder and Michael G. Miller. Goldfeder commented [...] "The commute for people here is only going to go from bad to worse. You can’t talk about a convention center without talking about transportation." [...] Goldfeder and Miller said they are not opposed to turning sections of the line into a park, but said {{people who live in the}} Rockaways, Ozone Park and other areas have no quick or easy way to get into Manhattan. The Genting Group, which operates Resorts World casino and have been asked to construct the convention center, are evaluating several plans to increase transportation access. Genting is committed to paying for part of the transportation improvements. Advocates of the Queensway, a proposed public park along the branch's route, are against resumption of rail service, stating that current bus service fills current transportation needs in the area. Congressmen Hakeem Jeffries and Gregory Meeks added their support for the project in March 2013. Both representatives will push to allocate federal transportation subsidies to study a plan for restored passenger service.|$|E
