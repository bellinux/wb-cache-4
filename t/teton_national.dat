5|$|Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park is {{the only}} U.S. National Park that permits hunting, but only of elk {{in an effort to}} keep the populations of that species regulated. This {{provision}} was included in the legislation that combined Jackson Hole National Monument and Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park in 1950. While some National Parks in Alaska permit subsistence hunting by indigenous natives and a few other National Park Service managed areas allow hunting under highly regulated circumstances, hunting in U.S. National Parks is not generally allowed. In Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park, hunters are required to obtain Wyoming hunting licenses and be deputized as park rangers. Hunting is restricted to areas east of the Snake River and north of Moran, Wyoming, the hunt is permitted only east of U.S. Route 89. Proponents of continuing the elk hunt, which occurs in the fall, argue that the elk herd would become overpopulated without it, leading to vegetation degradation from overgrazing elk herds. Opponents cite that there has been an increase of predators such as the wolf and grizzly bear in Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park, rendering the annual hunt unnecessary and exposing hunters to attacks by grizzly bears as they become accustomed to feeding on remains left behind from the hunt.|$|E
5|$|Sixty-one {{species of}} mammals have been {{recorded}} in Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park. This includes the gray wolf, which had been extirpated from the region by the early 1900s but migrated into the Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park from adjacent Yellowstone National Park after the species had been reintroduced there. The re-establishment of the wolves has ensured that every indigenous mammal species now exists in the park. In addition to gray wolves, another 17 species of carnivores reside within Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park including grizzlies and the more commonly seen American black bear. Relatively common sightings of coyote, river otter, marten and badger and occasional sightings of cougar, Canadian lynx and wolverine are reported annually. A number of rodent species exist including yellow-bellied marmot, least chipmunk, muskrat, beaver, Uinta ground squirrel, pika, snowshoe hare, porcupine, and six species of bats.|$|E

5|$|Efforts to {{preserve}} {{the region as a}} national park began in the late 19thcentury, and in 1929 Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park was established, protecting the Teton Range's major peaks. The valley of Jackson Hole remained in private ownership until the 1930s, when conservationists led by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. began purchasing land in Jackson Hole {{to be added to the}} existing national park. Against public opinion and with repeated Congressional efforts to repeal the measures, much of Jackson Hole was set aside for protection as Jackson Hole National Monument in 1943. The monument was abolished in 1950 and most of the monument land was added to Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park.|$|E
5|$|Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park {{is one of}} the ten most visited {{national}} parks in the U.S., with an annual average of 2.75million visitors in the period from 2007 to 2016, with 3.27 million visiting in 2016. The National Park Service is a federal agency of the United States Department of the Interior and manages both Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park and the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park has an average of 100 permanent and 180 seasonal employees. The park also manages 27 concession contracts that provide services such as lodging, restaurants, mountaineering guides, dude ranching, fishing and a boat shuttle on Jenny Lake. The National Park Service works closely with other federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, and also, in consequence of Jackson Hole Airport's presence in the park, the Federal Aviation Administration. Initial construction of the airstrip north of the town of Jackson was completed in the 1930s. When Jackson Hole National Monument was designated, the airport was inside it. After the monument and park were combined, the Jackson Hole Airport became the only commercial airport within a U.S. National Park. Jackson Hole Airport has some of the strictest noise abatement regulations of any airport in the U.S. The airport has night flight curfews and overflight restrictions, with pilots being expected to approach and depart the airport along the east, south or southwest flight corridors. As of 2010, 110 privately owned property inholdings, many belonging to the state of Wyoming, are located within Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park. Efforts to purchase or trade these inholdings for other federal lands are ongoing and through partnerships with other entities, 10million dollars is hoped to be raised to acquire private inholdings by 2016. Some monies are allocated from congress via the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park may not get all the money needed from the fund as it is divided up between four different federal agencies. Efforts to exchange federal land from other areas for inholdings were still in the negotiation phase in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park is {{an almost}} {{pristine}} ecosystem and the same species of flora and fauna that have existed since prehistoric times can still be found there. More than 1,000species of vascular plants, dozens of species of mammals, 300 species of birds, {{more than a dozen}} fish species and a few species of reptiles and amphibians exist. Due to various changes in the ecosystem, some of them human-induced, efforts have been made to provide enhanced protection to some species of native fish and the increasingly threatened whitebark pine.|$|E

In {{an effort to keep}} the park waterways free of various invasive species such as the Zebra mussel and whirling disease, boaters are expected to abide by certain regulations including displaying a self-certification of compliance on the dashboard of any vehicle attached to an empty boat trailer.|$|E
5|$|South of Moose on the Mooseâ€“Wilson Road, the Laurance S. Rockefeller Preserve Center {{is located}} on land that was privately owned by Laurance S. Rockefeller and is {{situated}} on Phelps Lake. Donated to Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park and {{opened to the public}} in 2008, the property was once part of the JY Ranch, the first dude ranch in Jackson Hole. At Jenny Lake, the Jenny Lake Visitor Center is open from mid-May to mid-September. This visitor center is within the Jenny Lake Ranger Station Historic District and is the same structure photographer Harrison Crandall had constructed as an art studio in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} {{altitude}} in Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park impacts {{the types of}} plant species found at various elevations. In the alpine zone above the tree line, which in Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park is at approximately , tundra conditions prevail. In this treeless region, hundreds of species of grass, wildflower, moss and lichen are found. In the subalpine region from the tree line {{to the base of}} the mountains, whitebark pine, limber pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce are dominant. In the valley floor, lodgepole pine is most common but Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and blue spruce inhabit drier areas, while aspen, cottonwood, alder, and willow are more commonly found around lakes, streams and wetlands. However, the tablelands above the Snake River channel are mostly sagebrush plains and in terms of acreage is the most widespread habitat in the park. The sagebrush plains or flats have 100 species of grasses and wildflowers. Slightly more elevated sections of the plains of the northern sections of Jackson Hole form forest islands with one such obvious example being Timbered Island. In this ecotone, forested islands surrounded by sagebrush expanses provide shelter for various animal species during the day and nearby grasses for night time foraging.|$|E

50|$|One {{of the few}} truly rural Clean Cities Coalitions, Yellowstone-Teton Clean Energy Coalition {{encompasses}} {{areas of}} western Wyoming, southwestern Montana, and Eastern Idaho known as the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The GYA encompasses more than 10 e6acre km2 and is the last intact, temperate ecosystem in the world. This ecosystem consists of two national parks (Yellowstone and Grand <b>Teton),</b> six <b>National</b> Forests (Targhee, Custer, Shoshone, Gallatin, Bridger/Teton, Deerlodge) and two U.S. Fish and Wildlife sites (National Elk Refuge, Red Lakes).|$|R
50|$|Numerous elk use {{the valley}} as grazing range during the winter, and sleigh rides are offered to tourists. The Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, Snow King and Grand Targhee Resort ski areas, and nearby Grand <b>Teton</b> and Yellowstone <b>national</b> parks are major tourist attractions {{throughout}} all seasons of the year.|$|R
5|$|The role of {{wildfire}} is {{an important}} one for plant and animal species diversity. Many tree species have evolved to mainly germinate after a wildfire. Regions of the park that have experienced wildfire in historical times have greater species diversity after reestablishment than those regions that have not been influenced by fire. Though the Yellowstone fires of 1988 had minimal impact on Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park, studies conducted before and reaffirmed after that event concluded than the suppression of natural wildfires during the middle part of the 20th century decreased plant species diversity and natural regeneration of plant communities. One study conducted 15 years before the 1988 Yellowstone National Park fires concluded that human suppression of wildfire had adversely impacted Aspen tree groves and other forest types. The majority of conifer species in Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park are heavily dependent on wildfire and this is particularly true of the Lodgepole Pine. Though extremely hot canopy or crown fires tend to kill Lodgepole Pine seeds, lower severity surface fires usually result in a higher post wildfire regeneration of this species. In accordance with {{a better understanding of the}} role wildfire plays in the environment, the National Park Service and other land management agencies have developed Fire Management Plans which provide a strategy for wildfire management and are expected to best enhance the natural ecosystem.|$|E
5|$|Yellowstone National Park is the {{centerpiece}} of the 20million acre/31,250square-mile (8,093,712ha/80,937km2) Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, a region that includes Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park, adjacent National Forests and expansive wilderness areas in those forests. The ecosystem is the largest remaining continuous stretch of mostly undeveloped pristine land in the continental United States, considered the world's largest intact ecosystem in the northern temperate zone. With the successful wolf reintroduction program, which began in the 1990s, virtually all the original faunal species known to inhabit the region when white explorers first entered the area can still be found there.|$|E
5|$|All campsites {{accessible}} only on foot or by horseback are considered backcountry campsites {{and they are}} available by permit only, but camping is allowed {{in most of these}} backcountry zones year-round. The National Park Service has a combination of specific sites and zones for backcountry camping with a set carrying capacity of overnight stays per zone to protect the resources from overcrowding. Open fires are not permitted in the backcountry and all food must be stored in an Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee approved bear-resistant container. As of 2012, only four brands of bear-resistant containers had been approved for use in the Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park backcountry. Additionally, hikers may use an approved bear spray to elude aggressive bears.|$|E

5|$|Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park {{has five}} front-country {{vehicular}} access campgrounds. The largest are the Colter Bay and Gros Ventre campgrounds, {{and each has}} 350campsites which can accommodate large recreational vehicles. Lizard Creek and Signal Mountain campgrounds have 60 and 86campsites respectively, while the smaller Jenny Lake campground has only 49 sites for tent use only. Additionally, full hookups for recreational vehicles are at the concessionaire managed 112campsites at Colter Bay Village and another 100 at Flagg Ranch in the John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway. Though all front-country campgrounds are only open from late spring to late fall, primitive winter camping is permitted at Colter Bay near the visitor center.|$|E
5|$|Population {{figures for}} elk are {{in excess of}} 30,000â€”the largest {{population}} of any large mammal species in Yellowstone. The northern herd has decreased enormously since the midâ€‘1990s; this {{has been attributed to}} wolf predation and causal effects such as elk using more forested regions to evade predation, consequently making it harder for researchers to accurately count them. The northern herd migrates west into southwestern Montana in the winter. The southern herd migrates southward, and the majority of these elk winter on the National Elk Refuge, immediately southeast of Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park. The southern herd migration is the largest mammalian migration remaining in the U.S. outside of Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park allows boating on all {{the lakes}} in Jackson Hole, but {{motorized}} boats can only be used on Jackson and Jenny Lakes. While there is no maximum horsepower limit on Jackson Lake (though there is a noise restriction), Jenny Lake is restricted to 10horsepower. Only non-motorized boats are permitted on Bearpaw, Bradley, Emma Matilda, Leigh, Phelps, String, Taggart and Two Ocean Lakes. There are four designated boat launches located on Jackson Lake and one on Jenny Lake. Additionally, sailboats, windsurfers and water skiing are only allowed on Jackson Lake and no jet skis are permitted {{on any of the}} park waterways. All boats are required to comply with various safety regulations including personal flotation devices for each passenger. Only non-motorized watercraft are permitted on the Snake River. All other waterways in the park are off limits to boating, and this includes all alpine lakes and tributary streams of the Snake River.|$|E

50|$|The western {{two-thirds of}} the state is covered mostly by the {{mountain}} ranges and rangelands of the Rocky Mountains, while the eastern third {{of the state is}} high elevation prairie called the High Plains. Almost half of the land in Wyoming is owned by the U.S. government, leading Wyoming to rank sixth by area and fifth by proportion of a state's land owned by the federal government. Federal lands include two <b>national</b> parksGrand <b>Teton</b> and Yellowstonetwo <b>national</b> recreation areas, two national monuments, several national forests, historic sites, fish hatcheries, and wildlife refuges.|$|R
40|$|The USGS and NASA, in {{conjunction}} with Colorado State University, George Mason University and other partners, have developed the Invasive Species Forecasting System (ISFS), a flexible tool that capitalizes on NASA's remote sensing resource to produce dynamic habitat maps of invasive terrestrial plant species across the United States. In 2006 ISFS was adopted to generate predictive invasive habitat maps to benefit noxious plant and fire management teams in three major National Park systems: The Greater Yellowstone Area (Yellowstone / Grand <b>Tetons</b> <b>National</b> Parks), Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park, and interior Alaskan (between Denali, Gates of The Arctic and Yukon-Charley). One of the objectives {{of this study is}} to explore how the ISFS enhances decision support apparatus in use by National Park management teams. The first step with each park system was to work closely with park managers to select top-priority invasive species. Specific species were chosen for each study area based on management priorities, availability of observational data, and their potential for invasion after fire disturbances. Once focal species were selected, sources of presence/absence data were collected from previous surveys for each species in and around the Parks. Using logistic regression to couple presence/absence points with environmental data layers, the first round of ISFS habitat suitability maps were generated for each National Park system and presented during park visits over the summer of 2006. This first engagement provided a demonstration of what the park service can expect from ISFS and initiated the ongoing dialog on how the parks can best utilized the system to enhance their decisions related to invasive species control. During the park visits it was discovered that separate "expert opinion" maps would provide a valuable baseline to compare against the ISFS model output. Opinion maps are a means of spatially representing qualitative knowledge into a quantitative two-dimensional map. Furthermore, our approach combines the qualitative expert opinion habitat maps [...] with the quantitative ISFS habitat maps in a difference map that shows where the two maps agree and disagree. The objective of the difference map is to help focus future field sampling and improve model results. This paper presents a demonstration of the habitat, expert opinion, and difference map for Yellowstone National Park...|$|R
5|$|Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park and the {{surrounding}} region host over 1,000 species of vascular plants. With an altitude variance of over , the park {{has a number of}} different ecological zones including alpine tundra, the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone where spruce-fir forests are dominant, and the valley floor, where a mixed conifer and deciduous forest zone occupies regions with better soils intermixed with sagebrush plains atop alluvial deposits. Additionally, wetlands near some lakes and in the valley floor adjacent to rivers and streams cover large expanses, especially along the Snake River near Oxbow Bend near Moran and Willow Flats near the Jackson Lake Lodge. Altitude, available soils, wildfire incidence, avalanches and human activities have a direct impact on the types of plant species in an immediate area. Where these various niches overlap is known as an ecotone.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{during the}} American {{occupation}} of Mexico after the Mexican-American War, Raynolds and other U.S. Army personnel {{were the first}} confirmed to have reached the summit Pico de Orizaba, the tallest mountain in Mexico, and inadvertently set {{what may have been}} a 50-year American alpine altitude record. In 1859, Raynolds was placed in charge of the first government-sponsored expedition to venture into the upper Yellowstone region that was later to become Yellowstone National Park. Heavy winter snowpack in the Absaroka Range of Wyoming prevented the expedition from reaching the Yellowstone Plateau, forcing them to divert to the south and cross Union Pass at the northern end of the Wind River Range. After negotiating the pass the expedition entered Jackson Hole and surveyed the Teton Range, now within Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} the ranges of coyotes and gray wolves overlap, {{interference}} competition and predation by wolves has been hypothesized to limit local coyote densities. Coyote ranges expanded during the 19th and 20th centuries following the extirpation of wolves, while coyotes were driven to extinction on Isle Royale after wolves colonized the island in the 1940s. One study conducted in Yellowstone National Park, where both species coexist, concluded that the coyote population in the Lamar River Valley declined by 39% following the reintroduction of wolves in the 1990s, while coyote populations in wolf inhabited areas of the Grand <b>Teton</b> <b>National</b> Park are 33% lower than in {{areas where the}}y are absent. Wolves have been observed to not tolerate coyotes in their vicinity, though coyotes {{have been known to}} trail wolves to feed on their kills.|$|E
