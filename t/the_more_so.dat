5|$|The summit {{observatory}} {{was built}} in the summer of 1883, and would remain in operation for 21 years. The first path to the summit was built {{at the same time as}} the observatory and was designed to allow ponies to carry up supplies, with a maximum gradient of one in five. The opening of the path and the observatory made the ascent of the Ben increasingly popular, all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> after the arrival of the West Highland Railway in Fort William in 1894. Around this time the first of several proposals was made for a rack railway to the summit, none of which came to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Edward II was a {{weak and}} ineffectual king (made to look <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> by {{comparison}} {{with his father and}} son, Edward I and Edward III), and his reign was marked by military failure and internal strife. A great number of the barony turned against the King, and the leader of the opposition eventually became Thomas of Lancaster. Lancaster was Edward's cousin, and next to the King he was the richest man in the country. Through a set of regulations known as the Ordinances, Lancaster and his associates had been trying to put restrictions on royal authority, but by the late 1310s Edward was again in full control of central government. The situation was aggravated by the King's ostentatious patronage of his favourite, Hugh Despenser, and Hugh's father by the same name.|$|E
5|$|The impenetrable Venusian {{cloud cover}} gave science fiction writers free rein to {{speculate}} on conditions at its surface; all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> when early observations showed {{that not only was}} it similar in size to Earth, it possessed a substantial atmosphere. Closer to the Sun than Earth, the planet was frequently depicted as warmer, but still habitable by humans. The genre reached its peak between the 1930s and 1950s, at a time when science had revealed some aspects of Venus, but not yet the harsh reality of its surface conditions. Findings from the first missions to Venus showed the reality to be quite different, and brought this particular genre to an end. As scientific knowledge of Venus advanced, so science fiction authors tried to keep pace, particularly by conjecturing human attempts to terraform Venus.|$|E

25|$|The {{massacre}} led to indignation {{from the}} international community, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> since the press of the time reported that the death toll was 254. Ben-Gurion roundly condemned it, as did the principal Jewish authorities: the Haganah, the Great Rabbinate and the Jewish Agency for Israel, who sent a letter of condemnation, apology and condolence to King Abdullah I of Jordan.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} Wagner {{was living in}} exile in Zurich, on the run after {{his role in the}} 1849 {{revolution}} in Dresden. His article followed a series of essays in the NZM by his disciple Theodor Uhlig, attacking the music of Meyerbeer’s opera Le prophète. Wagner was particularly enraged by the success of Le prophète in Paris, all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> because he had earlier been an admirer of Meyerbeer, who had given him financial support and used his influence to get Wagner’s early opera Rienzi, his first real success, staged in Dresden in 1841.|$|E

25|$|Several {{enclaves}} of Indians existed to {{the east}} of the frontier, among the Moravians near Bethlehem and elsewhere. The nearest of these were the Susquehannock tribe at Conestoga Town. To the north, such anger was directed by the settlers against the Moravian Indians, for their suspected part in abetting Indian raids, that the Moravians were sent to be kept in protective custody in Philadelphia. In Lancaster County, feelings were very much aroused against the Susquehannocks, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> after the Moravians were protected by the Commonwealth — whose authority the frontiersmen doubtless felt should be exerted for their protection against Indians and not vice versa. Col. Elder wrote to the government in September 1763, urging for the Susquehannocks to be removed to Philadelphia as well, but the proposal was declined.|$|E
25|$|Carr quickly {{established}} himself {{as a member of the}} Kent side, and by the second week of August had claimed 42 wickets in his first six first-class games. There was now a clamour for his inclusion in the England team, all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> as England were 2–1 down in the 1909 Ashes series at the time. The selectors agreed, and although Carr was twelfth man for the drawn game at Old Trafford, he was picked for the final match of the series at The Oval, becoming the first man ever to play Test cricket for England in his first year in the first-class game. Carr took 7/282 in the match, including 5/146 in the first innings, although his efforts could not force an English victory and the resulting draw meant that the Australians carried off the Ashes. Newspapers and Wisden heavily criticised the England captain Archie MacLaren for over-bowling Carr.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle Ages, {{the area}} was {{frequently}} mapped, due to its location on the Sweden-Norway frontier, which has existed since 1273. In that era, the massif was entirely Norwegian, but in 1644, Sweden succeeded in capturing Särna during the Torstenson War. However, in 1645, the Second Treaty of Brömsebro failed to clearly define the frontier, and not until 1751, after negotiations, was the current frontier established. If the wrangling over the border seemed to take forever, all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> since the zone was so trivial. The area around the mountain was not settled until later. This began on the Norwegian side: {{there was at least}} one farm at Ljørdalen in 1528. Not until the 18th century did the Swedish part become populated, initially with cabins for transhumance, for example at Mörkret. Virtual villages grew up after the beginning of the 19th century at Gördalen, Storbäcken, Storbron, Hägnåsen, Mörkret, Tjärnvallen and Lillådalen. Many of the park trails date from this era of transhumance.|$|E

25|$|Michelangelo {{takes all}} Brunelleschi’s {{components}} and bends {{them to his}} will. The Library is upstairs. It is a long low building with an ornate wooden ceiling, a matching floor and crowded with corrals finished by his successors to Michelangelo’s design. But it is a light room, the natural lighting streaming through a long row of windows that appear positively crammed between the order of pilasters that march along the wall. The vestibule, on the other hand, is tall, taller than it is wide and is crowded by a large staircase that pours out of the library in what Pevsner refers to as a “flow of lava”, and bursts in three directions when it meets the balustrade of the landing. It is an intimidating staircase, made all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> because {{the rise of the}} stairs at the center is steeper than at the two sides, fitting only eight steps into the space of nine.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrival of}} winter made life more {{difficult}} for the insurgents hiding in the mountains. Moreover, since October, the financial situation had been worrisome. In order to sustain the insurgents’ war effort, Venizelos had to take out loans. Thus, he borrowed 100,000 francs in obligations of 5 francs each in Greece. October also saw the first defections. Rebel bands from around Sitia laid down their arms and were granted an amnesty. In mid-October, Venizelos and his comrades recognised that {{it would be difficult to}} maintain the revolt, all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> as the latest military operations had been directly aimed at them, notably by the Russians. They gave notice that they were ready to entrust the island's fate to the Great Powers. Venizelos participated in new negotiations with the consuls, seeking to obtain a maximum of concessions regarding the island's internal affairs. In a letter addressed to the Great Powers, he stated his intention to lay down arms in exchange for honourable conditions. Most of the insurgents were ready to hand over their weapons and, for those who refused to lay down arms, it was proposed that they be transported to Greece without being disarmed. In exchange for 800 guns and the same number of cartridges, an amnesty would be possible for the insurgents, except for the gendarmes who had deserted. With these conditions, Venizelos accepted surrender. Several days later, he obtained the right to have the deserting gendarmes transported to Greece. On 25 November, the Theriso camp was broken up and an amnesty proclaimed.|$|E

500|$|Voorhis's 12th {{district}} leaned Republican, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> after Voorhis survived an attempt, in 1941, to gerrymander him out {{of office}} by removing strong Democratic precincts from the 12th during the decennial redistricting. Nevertheless, Voorhis was re-elected by 13,000votes in 1942, and by a similar margin two years later. Despite the Republican leanings of his district, Voorhis had not faced any strong opposition prior to 1946. Elected {{as part of the}} Roosevelt landslide of 1936, in 1938 he faced an opponent so shy that Voorhis had to introduce him to the crowd at a joint appearance. In 1940, he faced a military school principal, and his 1942 opponent, radio preacher and former Prohibition Party gubernatorial candidate Robert P. Shuler, [...] "even embarrassed GOP regulars". In 1944, the 12th district Republicans were bitterly divided, and Voorhis easily triumphed.|$|E

All foreigners living in France were put under police surveillance, had to produce six written statements from Frenchmen testifying to their loyalty to the republic in order to be granted residency permits, and on 12 April 1793 all foreigners were forbidden to leave France.

500|$|Having {{turned down}} an offer in 1947 {{to return to his}} old employer, Trinidad Leaseholds, in 1954 Constantine agreed to join the same company as an {{assistant}} legal advisor. Uncertain about going back to Trinidad after living for 25 years in England, he nevertheless believed it was a good time to return, particularly as his daughter was moving there to marry. Before leaving England, he published his book Colour Bar (1954), which addressed race relations in Britain and the racism he had experienced. It also discussed worldwide racial oppression and how the lives of black people could be improved. At the time, according to Peter Mason, this was [...] "an explosive, challenging, hard hitting tome, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> because it came not from a known black militant but from someone who seemed so charming, so unruffled, so suited to British society". Although not viewed as radical by black audiences, it was aimed at white British readers. The British press gave it mixed reviews and criticised him for unfairness in parts of the book; other critics accused him of communist sympathies.|$|E
500|$|More {{trouble with}} the {{legislature}} struck Greenfield in August 1922, during a special session called {{for the purpose of}} passing enabling legislation for a provincial wheat board. [...] The session lasted only a week, and on August 31 the only item of business that remained was the members' pay for the session. [...] The government was proposing $100 per member, but some MLAs complained that this was insufficient in light of the long travel times between Edmonton and their constituencies. [...] Greenfield, lacking the counsel of the vacationing Brownlee and wanting to avoid trouble, proposed upping the amount to $200. [...] Independent MLA Robert Pearson proposed increasing it once again, to $250, to match what their counterparts in Saskatchewan had received. [...] This suggestion was carried. [...] While Greenfield had hardly been {{the driving force behind the}} increases, he had facilitated them and had been blind to the appearance of paying MLAs more for six afternoons of work than some farmers were able to earn in a year. [...] The grassroots of his own party condemned the move, all <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>so</b> when the wheat board that had been the purpose of the special session failed to come to fruition.|$|E

[...] Voorhis was left with such Republican strongholds as San Marino, where he did not campaign, concluding that he would receive {{the same number of}} votes whether he visited there or not. [...] Despite the maneuvers of the Republicans in the legislature, Voorhis was re-elected in 1942, receiving 57% of the vote, and won with a similar percentage two years later. Voorhis had not faced strong opposition prior to 1946. [...] In his initial election, Voorhis benefited from the Roosevelt landslide of 1936.
