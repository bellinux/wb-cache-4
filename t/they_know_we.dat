500|$|The DJWS Remix of [...] "Do What U Want" [...] {{featuring}} R. Kelly and rapper Rick Ross {{was released}} on December 20, 2013. – Single|publisher=iTunes Store|accessdate=December 21, 2013|date=December 20, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419183954/https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/do-what-u-want-feat.-r.-kelly/id785737902?i=785737908=es|archivedate=April 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}} Ross told {{in an interview with}} MTV that he was not prepared for collaborating with Gaga. The remix starts with Kelly's vocals with a new introduction, followed by Ross rapping on a verse, adding new lines like [...] "Photos of the Bawse just to post 'em on a blog/Get alotta views cause <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> be the top/Jean Basquiats in the hall, she my work of art so I pin her to the wall." [...] During Gaga's vocals, the [...] "groove" [...] of the song is updated which was described by Fuse as [...] "nostalgic, banging, sex-freaky and new all at the same time. It's a 2013 ode to another era of synth R" [...] Molly Wardlow from the channel was however dismissive of Ross' verse, calling it unnecessary. Spin magazine's Chris Martin noted that Ross' contribution to [...] "Do What U Want" [...] sounded [...] "awkward" [...] and found similarity with Jay-Z's rap verse in singer Beyoncé's song, [...] "Drunk in Love". Mike Wass from Idolator commented that the remix felt unnecessary, following controversy in the media surrounding Ross' lyrics in the song [...] "U.O.E.N.O." [...] about date rape, and recapitulation of Kelly's child-sex abuse case.|$|E

6000|$|... "I reckon all {{the shots}} told," [...] Dave said; [...] "we could hardly miss that clump. Now I don't {{think you will}} see any more of them; <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> are here and <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> are ready for them, and it aint in Indian nature to throw away their lives {{charging}} up a place like this. They had reckoned the five first would go down anyhow. Then they will guess that we have got pistols, and the redskins hate six-shooters like poison." ...|$|E
60|$|Perhaps <b>they</b> were. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> {{were going}} away, at all events. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> what {{bringing}} out boxes and luggage means well enough.|$|R
60|$|No, but--They {{have been}} so kind; and the dogs were so kind. I am sure <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> were going, and were sorry too.|$|R
5000|$|.....down to an abject {{surrender}} {{through the}} accelerated sinking of their merchant marine and hunger alone, {{and when we}} didn't need to do it, and <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> didn't need to do it, and <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> didn't need to do it, we used them as an experiment for two atomic bombs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't that. If <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> {{have arrived}} here, {{they will do}} {{all they can to}} locate that {{treasure}} first. We want to keep dark and get ahead of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They'd {{hear you}} chopping," [...] {{said the man}} who had {{appeared}} first. [...] "The tent's just back there among the firs. We have got to have that post shifted before <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> are about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We might ford the stream," [...] said Dick. [...] "But {{what would}} be the use of trying to follow on horseback? <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> are after them and they will put on all the speed possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> were safe," [...] said Dave. [...] "Now that <b>they</b> don't <b>know</b> it <b>they</b> may worry, {{thinking}} we are snowed in {{somewhere along the}} road." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> were {{following}} them," [...] explained Dave. [...] "Link, I guess {{you had better}} admit that the game is up," [...] he went on, turning to his former schoolmate.|$|R
5000|$|I know, you know, he/she/it knows, (you both <b>know,</b> <b>they</b> both <b>know),</b> <b>we</b> <b>know,</b> you (plural) <b>know,</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, they cannot {{attack us}} from the channel, but they can attack us from somewhere else now <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> are here. They will find some {{place where they can}} land and take us in rear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, it's funny, and amuses people. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> are poor, so it's no use {{pretending that}} we have grooms, buy three or four hats a season, and have things as easy and fine as they do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> are armed, {{and they}} couldn't rush across the {{clearing}} and break in without {{one or more}} of them being shot, and they are too afraid of their hides to undertake the job. But they'll close in as soon as it's dark, beyond a doubt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{the eyes}} of Ham Spink and his crowd would stick out if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> had bagged so much game!" [...] exclaimed Whopper. [...] "If they had such luck they'd never get done talking about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Neith's {{dark blue}} eyes grew darker, and she said, [...] "Oh, Lord of truth! {{why should they}} love us? their love is vain; or fear us? for their fear is base. Yet let them testify of us, that <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> lived forever." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They know {{pretty well}} {{what they have}} to expect from us; <b>they</b> <b>know</b> how <b>we</b> shall meet any {{refractory}} spirit on their part; <b>they</b> <b>know</b> that <b>we</b> are not afraid of them. And now I'll just step into Chadwick's, and tell him what I've done; and then I'll go up to the palace, and answer this petition of theirs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will be {{vastly more}} {{difficult}} then than now," [...] Captain Forster said; [...] "Bathurst {{made his way}} out tonight without difficulty, {{but they will be}} a great deal more vigilant when <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> cannot hold out much longer. I don't see how it would be possible for women and children to get through them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So long as {{neither man}} nor beast has {{seen or heard}} us, we are safe," [...] said he. [...] "From the time <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> are here our {{troubles}} begin. There are no signs that they have found us out as yet. So our game surely is to lie low for a time and spy out the land. We {{want to have a}} good look at our neighbors before we get on visitin' terms." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Practical {{proof that}} these my words are true,--practical proof {{that they can}} make a nation all that England might be and is not,--the sight of what a people might become who, knowing thus far, do what <b>they</b> <b>know.</b> <b>We</b> believe no more than you, but we believe it. Come and see!--and yet you will not see; facts, and the reasons of them, will be as impalpable to you there as here, unless you can again obey your Novum Organum.' ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{governments of}} England and France knew {{perfectly}} well that Eisenhower's speech condemning their aggression was just a gesture {{for the sake of}} public appearances. But when we delivered our own stern warning to the three aggressors, <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> weren't playing games with public opinion. They took us seriously.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lie still, Amy. We {{are going}} to be {{captured}} by an English ship. It is the same privateer that I was in before. Don't make any sign, until they come on board. In the fury that these Spaniards are in, they might stick their knives into us, if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> were English." ...|$|R
60|$|We did {{not wish}} to invite our friends to the camp. They would {{certainly}} have come had <b>they</b> <b>known</b> <b>we</b> were there, but we had no accommodations for them, neither had we any desire for even transient visitors. Besides, we both thought that we would prefer that our ex-boarder and his wife should not <b>know</b> that <b>we</b> were encamped on that little peninsula.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll have to {{ask that}} {{question}} of someone else," [...] Dan said, with a grimace of pain. [...] "The last thing I know was when the tall fellow landed one square on my nose, and before I recovered both were out of sight. We have done harm rather than good, for now <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> overheard the conversation, an' we'll be mighty lucky if this is all we get before the fair comes to an end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Course I've had {{thoughts}} of pulling up stakes and going West. Maybe if they didn't know it beforehand, they wouldn't find out I'd ever {{been guilty of}} trying to think for myself. But--oh, I've worked hard, and built up this dairy business, and I hate {{to start all over}} again, and move Bea and the kid into another one-room shack. That's how they get us! Encourage us to be thrifty and own our own houses, and then, by golly, they've got us; <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> won't dare risk everything by committing lez--what is it? lez majesty?--I mean <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> won't be hinting around that if we had a co-operative bank, we could get along without Stowbody. Well----As long as I can sit and play pinochle with Bea, and tell whoppers to Olaf about his daddy's adventures in the woods, and how he snared a wapaloosie and knew Paul Bunyan, why, I don't mind being a bum. It's just for them that I mind. Say! Say! Don't whisper a word to Bea, but when I get this addition done, I'm going to buy her a phonograph!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} sure I did, Tom. We must {{wait until he}} shows himself a bit more. I reckon {{it is a good}} three hundred yards off, and a man's head is a {{precious}} small mark at that distance. Stand a bit higher and lay your rifle on the wall. Don't fire if he only puts his head out. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> can shoot, so there is not any occasion to give them another lesson. I don't hold to killing, unless you have got to do it. Let him have a good look at us.|$|E
5000|$|Study 1: Close friends' {{assessments}} of interpersonal knowledge: <b>We</b> <b>know</b> our close friends better than <b>they</b> <b>know</b> us. <b>We</b> understand them better, too.|$|R
2500|$|As the {{post-mortem}} examination began, Frank Paroubek {{was the first}} witness. Disregarding questions put {{to him by the}} coroner, Frank plunged into charges his daughter had been murdered. Through a translator, he asserted [...] "I am sure the gypsies stole my girl and then when <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> were after them, they killed her and threw her body into the canal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{without doing}} our {{intelligence}} a great injustice," [...] said Goodwin, {{with a smile}} and a shrug that he had picked up from the natives. [...] "Americano, though I am, they would have me in the calaboza in half an hour if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> had appropriated that valise. No; we must appear as ignorant about the money as the other ignoramuses in Coralio." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They do {{not appear}} to see us," [...] whispered Paul to Eve as he bent over, so as to put his head at an open window; [...] "and a return of the breeze may still save us. There is a great alarm among them and no doubt <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> are not distant; but so long as they cannot tell {{precisely}} where, we are comparatively safe.--Their cries do us good service as landmarks, and you may be certain I shall not approach the spots were they are heard. Pray Heaven for a wind, dearest Miss Effingham, pray Heaven for a wind!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No fools either," [...] Jerry agreed; [...] "a {{man would}} be worse than a natural {{if he were to}} go fooling about in this weather, and run a pretty good big risk of getting shot and nothing much to gain by it. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> have left their country now, and ain't likely to come back again either to hunt there or to dig gold, and that all we want is to get away as soon as we can. I allow that the chief is right, and that we sha'n't hear no more of them, anyhow not for some time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!--we should fight. Of {{course we}} should fight. Could any one but a {{congenital}} idiot suppose we shouldn't fight? <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>we</b> should fight. They aren't altogether idiots in Germany. But the thing's absurd. Why should Germany attack France? It's as if Manning here took a hatchet suddenly and assailed Edith.... It's just {{the dream of}} their military journalists. It's such schoolboy nonsense. Isn't that a beautiful pillar rose? Edith only put it in last year.... I hate all this talk of wars and rumours of wars.... It's worried all my life. And it gets worse and it gets emptier every year...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{will they}} think?" [...] cried Honora. [...] "They saw us leave Delmonico's at two o'clock, and <b>they</b> didn't <b>know</b> <b>we</b> {{were going to}} Westchester." ...|$|R
25|$|Here's {{the deal}} these days: <b>They</b> <b>know</b> exactly who <b>we</b> are. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> exactly where <b>we</b> live. We've {{got a few}} secrets left, and we're gonna use them. But just know that the end is coming. And <b>we</b> don't <b>know</b> how much longer we can do this. How much longer can we fight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Get {{out with}} you, Grant! If {{they were to}} take us at all, it would be because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>we</b> were the boys to do the fighting." ...|$|R
