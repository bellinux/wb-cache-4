5|$|Conwell {{arrived in}} Philadelphia on December 2, 1820. The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy that preceded Conwell's arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, William Hogan, {{approached}} de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia. After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan {{was assigned to}} St. Mary's Church. Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy. Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already {{moved out of the}} priests' residence at Old St. Joseph's Church to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> where he should live.|$|E

He said that the volunteers, who received another huge cheer, had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] "I made London, 2012". Coe thanked the country for getting behind the Games, and recalled his words from the Opening Ceremony [...] "these will be a games for everyone", concluding [...] "these were a games by everyone."

[...] "It has certainly never been news {{to me that a}} brave and brilliant man could love other men. He is my character. He is what he is and I have <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> what I say about him," [...] she said. Reaction has been mainly supportive on fans' Web sites, such as The Leaky Cauldron and MuggleNet.|$|E

2500|$|FIFA {{does not}} permit video {{evidence}} during matches, although it is permitted for subsequent sanctions. [...] The 1970 meeting of the International Football Association Board [...] "agreed to request the television authorities to refrain from any slow-motion play-back which reflected, or might reflect, adversely on any decision of the referee". In 2008, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said: [...] "Let it be as it is and let's leave [...] with errors. The television companies will have <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> [...] was right or wrong, but still the referee makes the decision – a man, not a machine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tenpenny {{is quoted}} as saying, [...] "The anti-free-speech terrorists have voiced bomb threats and have {{threatened}} violence against venue owners and their families." [...] It was later revealed that one bomb threat actually came from an [...] "anti-vaccination advocate who was disturbed {{by the thought that}} Tenpenny’s event might not go ahead." [...] The pro-vaccination group Stop the AVN spokesman, John Cunningham, stated that he calls this a win for Australians: [...] "Australia should be proud that as a nation, {{we have the ability to}} recognise when someone is trying to mislead us, and react accordingly. Free speech in Australia does not mean you have <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything you like without fear of criticism. Rather, anyone from politicians to health practitioners to journalists should be prepared to face vigorous criticism whenever they try and spread lies and, in this case, what amounts to ideologically driven rubbish." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1995 the Garvaghy Road Residents Coalition (GRRC) was formed, {{comprising}} {{representatives from}} the DFJG and the tenants' associations. Its main goal was to divert Orange marches away from Garvaghy Road through peaceful means. It held peaceful protests, petitioned the police and government ministers, and tried to draw media attention to the dispute. The GRRC held regular public meetings with residents. There were usually about 12 representatives on the committee at any one time. According to one of its members, Joanne Tennyson, [...] "Although the GRRC could speak to anyone they wanted, {{at the end of}} the day no-one in the committee had <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> we would do anything, not even [...] the spokesman. The community had to agree as a whole and that was the purpose of holding public meetings". The GRRC's first secretary and spokesman was Father Eamon Stack, a Jesuit priest and DFJG member who had lived in the area since 1993. Stack emphasized that the GRRC was non-sectarian and was not connected to any political parties. He would remain its spokesman until after July 1997.|$|E

2500|$|More vigils and gatherings {{were held}} in Canada to show support to France and condemn terrorism. Many cities had notable [...] "Je suis Charlie" [...] gatherings, {{including}} Calgary, Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto. In Calgary, {{there was a strong}} anti-terrorism sentiment. [...] "We're against terrorism and want to show them that they won't win the battle. It's horrible everything that happened, but they won't win," [...] commented one demonstrator. [...] "It's not only against the French journalists or the French people, it's against freedom – everyone, all over the world, is concerned at what's happening." [...] In Montreal, despite a temperature of , over 1,000 people gathered chanting [...] "Liberty!" [...] and [...] "Charlie!" [...] outside of the city's French Consulate.

Gothard's teachings discourage dating and rock music, including Christian rock. Gothard teaches that women working outside the home are putting themselves under another man's authority and conflict may arise. He has warned that some toys such as Cabbage Patch dolls may cause destructive behavior in children.|$|E
2500|$|The Republicans in the Minnesota House {{dismissed}} {{the idea of}} speech being an ethics violation, maintaining “Lindner's comments were offensive, but Lindner has <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> them.” Republican House Speaker Steve Sviggum pointed out that [...] "House Republicans didn't complain when Rep. Tom Rukavina, DFL-Virginia, called State Auditor Pat Awada, 'Osama Bin Awada'" [...] when Awada proposed to curb local government aid. Sviggum said [...] "everyone is entitled to First Amendment rights. 'At some point or another people have freedom of speech even though that speech may not be appropriate, politically correct or even the most wise speech.'" [...] Sviggum said [...] "I don't think {{that we want to}} take this to the ultimate end and put that chilling effect upon speech, upon feeling, upon values and principals that one has or doesn't have in this entire process." [...] Lindner also invoked freedom of speech, saying [...] "I still believe in the First Amendment -- that we're allowed to express our views and so forth -- and it's getting close to maybe not being able to do that, but while we can, I'm doing it." [...] In their rebuttal the House Republicans also played a recording of Ellison’s interview with a radio station. In the interview Ellison had said “People should feel free to express themselves as long as they don’t violate the law. ...I would never invoke the powers of the state to restrict Arlon Lindner from expressing himself.” ...|$|E

50|$|Hypocorrection is a {{linguistic}} phenomenon which involves the purposeful addition of slang {{in an attempt}} to appear less intelligible or soften the description. It contrasts with hesitation and modulation because, rather than not having <b>the</b> <b>right</b> words <b>to</b> <b>say</b> or choosing <b>to</b> avoid them, the speaker uses hypocorrection as a strategy.|$|R
