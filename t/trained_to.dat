5|$|A primary {{function}} of the FMPU was the training of combat cameramen. The units were based at nearby Page Military Academy. There were approximately 16 combat units, each made up of seven officers and between 20 and 30 enlisted men. They were <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> {{use a variety of}} photographic equipment and cameras and also received combat and weapons training. The cameramen were sent to every army air force base to document all aspects of the base's operations as well as aerial battle tactics and enemy airplane performance. Every cameraman was <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> load film into their camera under adverse conditions, and if need be, to develop it on location. Most of the aerial motion picture photography shot during World War II was filmed by Fort Roach alumni.|$|E

5|$|Consequently, {{under the}} socialist Second Republic, French {{instructors}} and other nationals were expelled, Malagasy was declared {{the language of}} instruction and a large cadre of young Malagasy were rapidly <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> teach at remote rural schools under the mandatory two-year national service policy.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Air Minister Power {{directed}} that {{a nationwide}} voluntary organization be formed to sponsor {{and develop a}} select group of young men who would be <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> meet the increasing need for operational pilots in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) during World War II.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the field geology training, Young and Duke also <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> use their EVA space suits, adapt to the reduced lunar gravity, collect samples, and drive the Lunar Roving Vehicle.

5|$|Rodents have {{sensitive}} olfactory abilities, {{which have}} been used by humans to detect odors or chemicals of interest. The Gambian pouched rat is able to detect tuberculosis bacilli with a sensitivity of up to 86.6%, and specificity (detecting the absence of the bacilli) of over 93%; the same species has been <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> detect land mines. Rats have been studied for possible use in hazardous situations such as in disaster zones. They can be <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> respond to commands, which may be given remotely, and even persuaded to venture into brightly lit areas, which rats usually avoid.|$|E
5|$|The intelligence, domesticability and {{versatility}} of {{the elephant}} gave it considerable advantages over other wild {{animals such as}} lions and bears used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more tractable than horses: while a horse can be <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead step over him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of war elephants with generals such as Hannibal. Elephants can be <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> execute prisoners {{in a variety of}} ways, and can be taught to prolong the agony of the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill the condemned quickly by stepping on the head.|$|E

5|$|After the {{problems}} with Hubble's mirror were discovered, the first servicing mission assumed greater importance, as the astronauts would need to do extensive work to install corrective optics.

5|$|Although {{happy in}} the company of others, they are fine if left alone. Sealyham Terriers are suited for both the town and country. They can be stubborn, vocal, and boisterous but also full of personality. While they make for loyal family companions, they can be <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> be working dogs, making them {{excellent}} mousers or ratters. They can also be taught as a puppy to get along with other animals, including cats and birds.|$|E
5|$|Although war pigeons {{and mobile}} dovecotes were used {{extensively}} during the Second World War, {{it is unclear}} to what extent, if any, they were employed for aerial photography. According {{to a report in}} 1942, the Soviet army discovered abandoned German trucks with pigeon cameras that could take photos in five-minute intervals, as well as dogs <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> carry pigeons in baskets. On the allied side, as late as 1943 it was reported that the American Signal Corps was aware of the possibility of adopting the technique.|$|E
5|$|Asian {{elephants}} perform {{tasks such}} as hauling loads into remote areas, moving logs to rivers and roads, transporting tourists around national parks, pulling wagons, and leading religious processions. In northern Thailand, the animals are used to digest coffee beans for Black Ivory coffee. They are valued over mechanised tools because they can work in relatively deep water, require relatively little maintenance, need only vegetation and water as fuel and can be <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> memorise specific tasks. Elephants can be <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> respond to over 30 commands. Musth bulls can be difficult and dangerous {{to work with and}} are chained and semi-starved until the condition passes. In India, many working elephants are alleged to have been subject to abuse. They and other captive elephants are thus protected under The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act of 1960.|$|E

5|$|Bears {{in captivity}} have for centuries {{been used for}} entertainment. They have been <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> dance, and were kept for baiting in Europe {{at least since the}} 16th century. There were five bear-baiting gardens in Southwark, London at that time; archaeological remains of three of these have survived. Across Europe, nomadic Romani bear {{handlers}} called Ursari lived by busking with their bears from the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Bellona {{opened fire}} on Corageux while Brilliant engaged Maliceuse and Hermione. Through {{skillful}} sailing, Logie {{was able to keep}} both French frigates at bay and unable to assist Courageux, which surrendered to Bellona after ninety minutes of fighting. At 7.30 a.m. Maliceuse and Hermione made sail and retreated, with Brilliant too damaged to give chase. British losses in the battle numbered six killed and 28 wounded on Bellona and five killed and 16 wounded on Brilliant. On the French side, losses on Courageux alone were 240 killed and 110 wounded. Historian William Laird Clowes has suggested that the much higher French casualty rate was the result of differences in tactics, with the French gun crews <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> fire at the masts and rigging of an enemy ship in order to disable them ahead of a boarding attempt. By contrast, British crews were <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> fire into the hulls of enemy ships.|$|E
5|$|By May 3, 1986, {{production}} {{had moved}} to New Orleans. In the town of Thibodaux, Louisiana, Parker and his crew discovered a plantation village that {{would serve as a}} graveyard. An unused Louisiana field was used to create a racetrack where Angel meets the wealthy patriarch Ethan Krusemark (Fontelieu). On May 13, the crew encountered some difficulty filming a chase scene involving Angel, as they had to deal with shying horses, trained dogs, gunshots, two hundred chickens, and a horse specially <b>trained</b> <b>to</b> fall on top of Rourke's stuntman.|$|E
