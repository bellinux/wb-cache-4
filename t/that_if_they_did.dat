5|$|In 1962, two-time former {{governor}} and Democratic factional leader Happy Chandler {{had already begun}} his campaign for a third term as governor. The anti-Chandler faction became concerned <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not name a candidate, Chandler's early announcement would give him an advantage in the 1963 election. Leaders of the faction were solidly behind state Highway Commissioner Henry Ward, but Governor Combs was leaning toward Breathitt. Breathitt announced his candidacy on May 2, 1962, but many in his party remained skeptical due to his youth and relative inexperience. Combs eventually convinced the anti-Chandler faction to back Breathitt, and Ward never became a candidate.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} day the crew trapped in the gunroom created a small {{explosion}} just outside it, using gunpowder, in which Gulik was injured again. Their hope was to frighten the Malagasy into submission, and a female Malagasy who had been held in the gunroom was instructed to tell the other Malagasy <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not surrender, the crew would blow up the ship. The Malagasy responded by saying that they had seen the fearful effect that the explosion also had on the crew, and refused to surrender, again demanding that they be returned to Madagascar. Olof Leij agreed, but Captain Muller ordered the crew to sail the ship towards Cape Agulhas, the southernmost point of Africa. Muller's assessment was that the Malagasy had little skill in seafaring and navigation and therefore {{would be unlikely to}} notice the deception, which proved to be the case. After three or four days' sailing they sighted land, the VOC settlement of Struisbaai.|$|E
5|$|The Cabildo {{rejected}} Cisneros' resignation, {{and ordered}} the military to control the crowd and enforce {{the resolution of the}} previous day. The commanders pointed out <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> so, their soldiers would mutiny. As the demonstration overran some sections of the cabildo, Cisneros' resignation was finally accepted. The members of the new Junta were the result of a document with hundreds of signatures, drafted among the people in the plaza. Cornelio Saavedra was the president of this Junta. He rejected this at first, fearing that he may be suspected of promoting the revolution for personal interest, but finally accepted at Cisneros' request. As the Junta was established on May 25, the other cities were invited to send deputies to a constituent assembly to discuss the type of government; on May 27, they were invited to send deputies to join the Junta. Both invitations were contradictory, but the consequences would take place some months later.|$|E

5|$|At 3 a.m. about 120 {{bank and}} trust company {{officials}} assembled {{to hear a}} full report {{on the status of}} the failing trust companies. While the Trust Company of America was barely solvent, the Lincoln Trust Company was probably $1 million short of what it needed to cover depositor accounts. As discussion ensued, the bankers realized that Morgan had locked them in the library and pocketed the key to force a solution, the sort of strong-arm tactic he had been known to use in the past. Morgan then entered the talks and advised the trust companies they must provide a loan of $25 million to save the weaker institutions. The trust presidents were still reluctant to act, but Morgan informed them <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not it would lead to a complete collapse of the banking system. Through his considerable influence, at about 4:45a.m. he persuaded the unofficial leader of the trust companies to sign the agreement, and the remainder of the bankers followed. Having received these commitments, Morgan allowed the bankers to go home.|$|E
5|$|Nomura {{placed a}} secret trailer in Kingdom Hearts {{in hopes that}} fans would want a sequel. He was unsure if fans would want a sequel and felt <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not, {{then it would be}} best to leave certain events in the first game unexplained. After Kingdom Hearts Final Mix was completed, {{development}} for Kingdom Hearts II began. There were several obstacles to clear before development could begin on a sequel. One was the development team's desire to showcase Mickey Mouse more; Mickey's inclusion in the first game was restricted to a very small role. Nomura had planned for the sequel to take place a year after the first and originally intended for the events of that year to be left unexplained. To bridge the gap between the two games, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories was developed. Nomura was hesitant about releasing a game on the Game Boy Advance because he felt the 3D graphics of the original game would not translate well into 2D. He changed his position after hearing that children wanted to play Kingdom Hearts on the handheld system.|$|E
5|$|When Brion sent a {{bill for}} the {{abandoned}} sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer complained of intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the Figure 8 album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith {{sent a message to}} the executives, stating <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not release him from his contract, he would take his own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell of Goldenboy. McConnell told Spin that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1,500 worth of heroin and crack per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips and Scott McPherson of Sense Field played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass guitar and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.|$|E

25|$|In January 2011, Clement {{spoke out}} against a ruling of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) which allowed usage-based billing for {{wholesale}} clients and smaller internet service providers. Citing concerns about how the change could adversely affect consumers, small businesses and entrepreneurs, he warned <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not revise the decision, the government would intervene.

25|$|To appease Huehueteotl, {{the fire}} god {{and a senior}} deity, the Aztecs had a {{ceremony}} where they prepared a large feast, {{at the end of}} which they would burn captives; before they died they would be taken from the fire and their hearts would be cut out. Motolinía and Sahagún reported that the Aztecs believed <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not placate Huehueteotl, a plague of fire would strike their city. The sacrifice was considered an offering to the deity.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{agreement}} at Alinagar, neither side was {{content with the}} status quo. The British felt <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not assert their position, the French would become the dominant power in Bengal. Siraj ud-Daulah was fearful of being forced to accept British suzerainty. His position was weakened by his unpopularity with his own subjects, {{and the threat of}} other military enemies to the west. He began to take steps to drive the British out of Bengal entirely.|$|E

25|$|Early in 1934, three {{priests and}} two laypeople {{were taken out}} of their special regime Kolyma camp to the local OGPU administration. They were asked to renounce their faith in Jesus, and were warned <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not do so they would be killed.

25|$|Subsequent to {{the arrival}} of French {{children}} in Quebec in 1634, measles was also brought along with them, which quickly spread among the Native American people. Jesuit priest Jean de Brébeuf described the symptoms as being severe. Brebeuf stated that the Native American's fearlessness towards death upon this disease made them perfect candidates for conversion to Christianity. The Native Americans believed <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not convert to Christianity, they would be exposed to the evil magic of the priests that caused the illness.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} was made to confront the Indian naval ratings on board the destroyer Hindustan, armed with 4-in. guns. During the morning three guns (caliber unknown) from the Royal Artillery C. Troop arrived on the island. The Royal Artillery positioned the battery within point blank range of the Hindustan on the dockside. An ultimatum was delivered to the mutineers aboard Hindustan, stating <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not the leave the ship and put down their weapons by 10:30 they would have to face the consequences. The deadline came and went and there was no message from the ship or any movement.|$|E

Each denied voluntarily joining any terrorist forces. As {{noted by}} the District Court, they did not deny having fought for the Taliban, but claimed <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> take up arms, {{it was only when}} being attacked and in self-defense. Rasul and Iqbal say they were with the Taliban because they were taken captive. Hicks is silent on the matter in court filings, but his father, in filing the brief, said that he believed that his son had joined the Taliban forces.|$|E

He stated that he was confident that the Cameron government would reject Heathrow expansion but <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not then he would resign as an MP and trigger a by-election. In July 2015, he also condemned the Airports Commission report written by the economist Howard Davies which backed Heathrow expansion; Goldsmith claimed that Davies had already decided on his conclusion before producing the three-year study. Davies responded by alleging that Goldsmith was lying, but the latter stood by his claim, as evidence citing that information he supplied to Davies' commission was not taken seriously.|$|E
25|$|Louis Coulon de Villiers, who did {{not know}} when British {{reinforcements}} might arrive, sent an officer under a white flag to negotiate. Washington did not allow the Canadian officer into or near the fort, but sent two of his own men, including his translator Jacob Van Braam, to negotiate. As negotiations began, the Virginians, against Washington's orders, broke into the fort's liquor supply and got drunk. Coulon told Van Braam that all he wanted was the surrender of the garrison, and the Virginians could go back to Virginia. He warned, however, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> not surrender now, the Indians might storm the fort and scalp the entire garrison.|$|E
