Exports to New Zealand have continued ever since, but to broaden their export potential, Holden began to cater their Commodore, Monaro and Statesman/Caprice models for both right- and left-hand drive markets. The Middle East is now Holden's largest export market, with the Commodore sold as <b>the</b> <b>Chevrolet</b> Lumina since 1998, and the Statesman since 1999 as <b>the</b> <b>Chevrolet</b> Caprice. Commodores are also sold as <b>the</b> <b>Chevrolet</b> Lumina in Brunei, Fiji and South Africa, and as <b>the</b> <b>Chevrolet</b> Omega in Brazil. Pontiac in North America also imported Commodore sedans from 2008 through to 2009 as the G8. The G8's cessation was {{a consequence of}} GM's Chapter 11 bankruptcy resulting in {{the demise of the}} Pontiac brand.|$|E

5|$|The full Holden VE {{range was}} {{exported}} {{and sold to}} New Zealand, whereas in the Middle East and South Africa it was re-branded as <b>the</b> <b>Chevrolet</b> Lumina. Sales of the Berlina began in 2007 for Brazilian market as <b>the</b> <b>Chevrolet</b> Omega. Pontiac in North America also imported Commodore sedans from 2008 through to 2009 as the G8.

50|$|In {{the rolling}} start for Race 1, Gabriele Tarquini {{immediately}} got alongside <b>the</b> two <b>Chevrolets</b> on <b>the</b> front row, only to hit Huff {{at the first}} corner and damage his rear suspension, forcing him to retire and causing a chain reaction in which local driver Norbert Michelisz was pushed off. Mehdi Bennani briefly moved into second before being pushed back to fourth at turn 3 by <b>the</b> <b>Chevrolets</b> who now led 1-2-3. They quickly left {{the rest of the}} field behind and Yvan Muller took an unchallenged victory ahead of Rob Huff. Huff had to fend off a mid-race attack from Alain Menu who despite staying within a second of Huff throughout the race had to settle for third.

5|$|From the onset, {{parent company}} General Motors was {{interested}} in incorporating a left-hand drive Commodore in its Buick lineup, as manifested by the unveiling of the Buick XP2000 concept car in 1996. Although this idea was ultimately abandoned (due to pressures by the North American automotive trade unions to retain local production), the GM-funded project allowed Holden {{to enter into a}} range of left-hand export markets. Thus began the Commodore's rapid expansion into parts of Indochina, the Middle East and South Africa badged as <b>the</b> <b>Chevrolet</b> Lumina and Brazil as <b>the</b> <b>Chevrolet</b> Omega 3.8 V6. In its home market, the VT series was awarded the 1997 Wheels Car of the Year award, the fourth such award in Commodore's history. It found ready acceptance in the market as many buyers steered away from the slow selling Ford AU Falcon, becoming the best selling Commodore to date and cementing its place as number one in Australian sales.|$|E
