50|$|After {{a number}} of {{pioneering}} insurance bad faith cases in the 1950s and 1960s, it became common for U.S. insurers to reflexively issue reservation of rights letters in response to practically every tender of a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>claim</b> by an insured. Under those earlier cases, it was held that if an insurer withdrew a defense after failing to reserve their rights, they could be (and were actually often held to be) liable for all damages suffered by the insured, including damages {{in excess of the}} policy's limits of coverage. Therefore, insurers wanted to always reserve their right to withdraw if facts were later discovered precluding coverage (e.g., evidence that the insured was guilty of an intentional tort, which is uninsurable).|$|E

Usually, a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>claim</b> scrubbing system is then used to ensure that claims are as clean and complete as possible, including edits that may automatically update the raw claim data received from the host system. The intention of this scrubbing is to inevitably avoid generating a potential denial from the payer, which can prolong reimbursement to a provider. The claim is then sent out from the provider to the payer in a ANSI 837 5010 standard format.|$|E

Subsets of these agents contract {{with each other}} to further their network project and these contracts can create benefits for, or impose costs on, agents who are not contract parties. Contract law regulates <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>claims</b> against contract <b>parties</b> with the third-party beneficiary doctrine, which directs courts to ask whether the contracting parties “intended” to benefit a particular <b>third</b> <b>party.</b> We show here what courts do with <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>claims</b> when network members fail to perform for <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> and what the law’s best responses to such breaches should be. Among our principal results are that courts honor <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>claims</b> when contract members likely can price them and when <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> incur substantial reliance losses, but protect <b>third</b> <b>party</b> interests less frequently than they should and refuse relief when contract members can identify the potential beneficiary class but not every agent who is likely to be in it...|$|R

40|$|In PPG Industries, Inc. v. Transamerica Insurance CO., the California Supreme Court {{held that}} an insurer may not {{indemnify}} its insured for a punitive damages judgment {{in a third}} party action. Even if the excess judgment {{is the result of}} the insurer 2 ̆ 7 s bad faith breach of its duty to settle a third party action on behalf of its insured, an insured may not recover if it seeks compensatory damages that include a punitive damages judgment. The California Supreme Court found that to conclude otherwise would violate California 2 ̆ 7 s long established public policy precluding indemnification of punitive damages. This Note examines the faulty reasoning in the California Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision. Part II briefly discusses relevant principles of insurance law. Part III outlines the facts underlying PPG Industries, Inc. v. Transamerica Insurance Co., including the initial Colorado lawsuit that evolved into the case ultimately presented to the California Supreme Court. Part IV explains the procedural history of the case, including the California Court of Appeal 2 ̆ 7 s opinion and PPG Industries, Inc. 2 ̆ 7 s appeal to the California Supreme Court. Part V details the California Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s analysis and its focus on California 2 ̆ 7 s public policy against indemnification of punitive damages. Part VI discusses Justice Mosk 2 ̆ 7 s heated dissent and his opposition to what he viewed as the majority 2 ̆ 7 s apparent favoritism of insurers. Finally, Part VII criticizes the California Supreme Court for ignoring PPG Industries, Inc. 2 ̆ 7 s allegations that it was entitled to recover consequential damages arising from Transamerica 2 ̆ 7 s bad faith failure to settle a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>claim,</b> thereby setting a precedent that allows insurers to escape liability for their own tortious conduct...|$|E
