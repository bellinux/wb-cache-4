25|$|At sea, Full-Eyes spots two {{warships}} tailing them. Thorfinn, {{along with}} the unwanted assistance of Hild, separates from the group, as {{he is the one}} Floki wants dead. They will meet back up in Odense, Denmark. Some of Floki’s men follow them on land where they attack fishermen and burn boats to stop their means of escape. Thorfinn tries to rationalize with those men to take him to Floki but all <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> his head. With no other choice, Thorfinn fights them barehanded and backup from Hild. With only three pursuers remaining, one of them kills their leader. It turns out that the other two are part of the Vagn Battalion who infiltrated Floki’s army to track their movements. The two men, Eskil and Vrage, ask Thorfinn for assistance to vanquish Floki once and for all. They were testing him during his fight against the pursuers to observe his strength and noble birth as the candidate for leader of the Jomsvikings. Even if Thorfinn tries to live his life as a traveling merchant, he still cannot escape his bloody past.|$|E

[...] Aubrey's treachery led the producer John Houseman in 1959 to dub him [...] "The Smiling Cobra." [...] Houseman in public was less direct. In December 1962, CBS announced it was spending $250,000 an episode on Houseman's hour-long drama on American history for the next season, The Great Adventure, but on July 25, 1963, CBS announced Houseman had resigned. The producer told The New York Times [...] "The kind of show <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> not what I wanted to produce" [...] but attributed his departure to a simple difference of opinion, the Times reporter stating Houseman [...] "expressed no criticism of CBS."

500|$|Alien: Isolation {{was first}} {{unveiled}} on 12 May 2011 when UK government minister Ed Vaizey visited the Creative Assembly and revealed on his Twitter account that the studio was hiring for an Alien game. Although no gameplay details were confirmed, the Creative Assembly did confirm to CVG {{that the game}} would be released for consoles, but did not specify any format. Sega boss Mike Hayes {{also said that the}} game was going to be [...] "very much a triple-A project. We want this to be a peer to the likes of Dead Space 2." [...] Although the game's name was anticipated following a trademark registration in October 2013 and some screenshots of the game were leaked in December 2013, Alien: Isolation was formally announced and confirmed for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One platforms with the release of a teaser trailer on 7 January 2014. The developers also stated that they were not worried about the fact that Sega's previous Alien game, , received a negative public reaction. According to Napper, [...] "It did completely reaffirm to us that there was a massive Alien fanbase out there [...] just to see such a vocal reaction to the game, everything that they've said <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> something that we're building and we're very excited about that." ...|$|E
500|$|The writer Michael Steinberg {{described}} the symphony's success as essentially {{a phenomenon of}} the compact disc, and while live performances are still given, they do not always sell out. Some critics, wondering at the sudden success of the piece nearly two decades after its composition, suggest that it resonated with a particular mood in the popular culture at the time. Stephen Johnson, writing in A guide to the symphony, wondered whether the commercial success of the work was [...] "a flash in the pan" [...] or {{would turn out to}} have lasting significance. In 1998, the critic Michael Steinberg asked, [...] " [...] really listening to this symphony? How many CD buyers discover that fifty-four minutes of very slow music with a little singing in a language they don't understand is more than <b>they</b> <b>want?</b> <b>Is</b> it being played as background music to Chardonnay and brie?" [...] Steinberg compared the success of Górecki's symphony to the Doctor Zhivago phenomenon of 1958: [...] "Everybody rushed to buy the book; few managed actually to read it. The appearance of the movie in 1965 rescued us all from the necessity." [...] Górecki was as surprised as anyone else at the recording's success, and later speculated that [...] "perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music…. Somehow I hit the right note, something they were missing. Something, somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Andrew Barker of Variety {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, stating, [...] "The stock dismissal 'more of the same' {{has rarely been}} more accurately applied to a sequel than to The Hangover Part II, which ranks {{as little more than}} a faded copy of its predecessor superimposed on a more brightly colored background". Christy Lemire of the Associated Press said, [...] "Giving the people what <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> one thing. Making nearly the exact same movie a second time, but shifting the setting to Thailand, is just... what, lazy? Arrogant? Maybe a combination of the two". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times also gave the film an average review stating, [...] "The Hangover Part II plays like a challenge to the audience's capacity for raunchiness.

2500|$|In January 1912 Jack Joyce's Wild West Show was {{appearing}} at Coliseum in London. Later, in May of that year, {{it was the}} big attraction at the New Hippodrome Palast in Berlin. The popular American cowboy had with him about a half dozen boys from Texas and a troupe of fake Indians. The [...] "demand for a wild west show {{is so great that}} the Germans don't worry about the genuineness of the red skin--all <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>is</b> the excitement connected with the show." [...] Joyce had a pretty strong feeling for cowgirls. Although they were not easily found in Berlin, he did not worry. He made a selection among a throng of Berlin maidens and trained them to be cowgirls. In 1916 Jack Joyce was doing well with his circus and wild west show touring Sweden.
