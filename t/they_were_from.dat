5|$|Following {{the issues}} with the {{publishing}} of Killing Time, there was increased oversight by Roddenberry's staff regarding the novels published by Pocket Books. This was delegated to Arnold, and would later cause confusion for Pocket Books as comments would be sent back and it was sometimes unclear whether <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>from</b> Roddenberry or Arnold. These comments rejected plot developments in the novels where they were {{stepping out of the}} bounds set by the television series. Rumours subsequently spread that there was an alternative version of the manuscript with more explicit Kirk/Spock slash details, something that Van Hise later denied.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Lao She {{introduced}} Xin Fengxia to {{the famous}} playwright Wu Zuguang. Like many intellectuals at the time, Wu held high hopes for the new People's Republic and returned to China from British Hong Kong. Xin, who had acted in one of Wu's plays, admired his talent. They married that year, {{despite the fact that}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>from</b> differing socioeconomic backgrounds; she had no formal education and was nearly illiterate, while he was from a prominent family of scholars. Wu helped her to study reading, writing, and calligraphy. She also studied painting with Qi Baishi, one of the most celebrated masters of Chinese painting, who took her as his goddaughter.|$|E

5|$|Rehabilitation is {{available}} to some confiscated slow lorises. Organizations such as the International Animal Rescue (IAR) run sanctuaries that offer lifelong care to slow lorises that have had their teeth removed, while also providing education and awareness programs to local people to help end domestic trade. By collaborating with authorities, healthy slow lorises are released back into the wild. However, identification is critical because authorities still manage all slow lorises as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>from</b> one species, resulting in species being released into the wrong locations and increasing confusion in taxonomy and conservation.|$|E
5|$|Game 1 {{was held}} in Washington, where Capitals owner Ted Leonsis took steps to prevent Penguins' fans from {{purchasing}} tickets, such as not selling tickets to customers whose 724 or 412 area code indicated <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>from</b> Western Pennsylvania. Crosby scored to give the Penguins a first period lead, but Washington scored two goals before {{the conclusion of the}} period. Mark Eaton tied the game in the second period, but Washington's Semyon Varlamov held the Penguins scoreless {{for the remainder of the}} game as the Capitals took a 1–0 lead in the series. The game had 40%more viewers than playoff games the previous season. In Game 2, Ovechkin and Crosby scored three goals each, though Dave Steckel's second period goal was the difference as Washington won 4–3.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the tornado, {{large-scale}} search and rescue operations took place in the affected areas. A major disaster declaration was signed by President Bill Clinton the following day (May 4), allowing for the state to receive federal aid. In the following months, disaster aid amounted to $67.8 million. In light of the fatalities that occurred under highway overpasses, the notion of them being safe areas to seek shelter was dismissed, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>from</b> then on considered {{to be one of the}} most dangerous places to be during a tornado. Reconstruction projects in subsequent years led to a safer, tornado-ready community. In May 2013, similar areas adjacent to the 1999 storm's track were again devastated by an EF5 tornado, resulting in 24 fatalities and extreme damage in the South Oklahoma City/Moore area.|$|E

5|$|On August 18, 2007, Anderson gave an {{interview}} in which he admitted to using steroids when he was performing on the independent wrestling scene, stating that he had quit using them in November 2005 to comply with WWE's Talent Wellness Program, implying that his job in the promotion was worth more than extra muscle mass. 12 days later, on August 30, his statements were shown to be incorrect when he, along with nine other WWE wrestlers, were named in a Sports Illustrated article as having received performance-enhancing drugs in direct non-compliance with the WWE Talent Wellness Program. Anderson received anastrozole, somatropin, and testosterone between October 2006 and February 2007.

5|$|The initial {{use for the}} Di 3 was {{to operate}} the three non-electrified long-distance lines of NSB: the Bergen Line, the Dovre Line and the Nordland Line.

The stock was sufficient to replace all steam locomotives on the Nordland Line, and reduced travel time by one hour. From Hamar to Otta, the track did not have sufficient permitted axle load. From the second batch of eight units, five were put into service on the Bergen Line, the rest on the Dovre and Nordland Lines. Necessary upgrades of the permitted axle load {{had been made to}} the Dovre Line and Nordland Line, and the locomotives were in use from Hamar to Saltdal. On 30 November, the Nordland Line was completed to Fauske, and the full length operated with Di 3.|$|E
