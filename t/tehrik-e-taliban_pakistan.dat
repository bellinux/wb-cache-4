5000|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} reason why the <b>Tehrik-e-Taliban</b> <b>Pakistan</b> {{attacked}} Ahmadi mosques was because Al Qaeda wished to gain public support in Pakistan. Al Qaeda have been launching attacks on Shia congregations in the past, but a majority of Sunnis did not endorse these attacks. Brigadier Saad said that by attacking a [...] "community that is not liked by most of (sic) Sunni Muslims belonging to the Deobandi and Barelvi schools of thought, the terror network has attempted to win some sort of support from these groups" [...] and that also because of the attack [...] "at least close to two million those who study at Deobandi madrassahs across Pakistan would definitely have some kind of “favorable” opinion about al Qaeda."

A spokesman for the group told reporters in the country's northwest that the target of the attackers was the PAF airbase. The assault was reportedly launched from a nearby village named Abdra, according to a PAF spokesman, who added that a joint counter-terrorism operation by several security agencies was under way. The BBC reported that the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan also {{played a role in the}} attack.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2009, Fazlullah {{told the}} BBC's Urdu Service {{that he had}} escaped from Pakistan to Afghanistan and warned that he would {{continue}} to attack Pakistani forces in Swat.

He narrowly escaped a U.S. drone strike on 25 November 2014. After reports that Fazlullah masterminded the Peshawar school attack, Pakistan Army officials were pressured to kill him within 24 hours. On the other hand, Pakistani officials in turn have asked Afghan authorities to capture and hand over Fazlullah multiple times.|$|E
5000|$|In a 2010 letter, bin Laden chastised {{followers}} who had reinterpreted al-tatarrus—an Islamic doctrine {{meant to}} excuse the unintended killing of non-combatants in unusual circumstances—to justify routine massacres of Muslim civilians, which had turned Muslims against the extremist movement. Of the groups affiliated with al-Qaida, Bin Laden condemned <b>Tehrik-e-Taliban</b> <b>Pakistan</b> {{for an attack}} on members of a hostile tribe, declaring that [...] "the operation is not justified, as there were casualties of noncombatants." [...] Bin Laden wrote that the tatarrus doctrine [...] "needs to be revisited based on the modern-day context and clear boundaries established." [...] He asked a subordinate {{to draw up a}} jihadist code of conduct that would constrain military operations in order to avoid civilian casualties. In Yemen, Bin Laden urged his allies to seek a [...] "truce" [...] that would bring the country [...] "stability" [...] or would at least [...] "show the people that we are careful in keeping ... the Muslims safe on the basis of peace." [...] In Somalia, he called attention to the extreme poverty caused by constant warfare, and he advised al-Shabab to pursue economic development. He instructed his followers around the world to focus on education and persuasion rather than [...] "entering into confrontations" [...] with Islamic political parties.|$|E

40|$|The {{spillover}} {{effects of}} the war in Afghanistan gave birth to a new breed of terrorist groups in the tribal areas of Pakistan. Inspired by al-Qaeda 2 ̆ 7 s ideology, <b>Tehrik-e-Taliban</b> <b>Pakistan</b> (TTP) is at the pinnacle of this list. Through the application of theories available on the terrorist lifecycle, this paper analyses the factors that led to the emergence, rise, and downfall of the TTP. The paper argues that the organisation conforms to the general trends of a terrorist lifecycle and, having lost critical elements of support and survival, the TTP 2 ̆ 7 s demise in the near future is predictable...|$|E
40|$|Nestled in the SWAT valley lies Pakistan’s {{earliest}} known deradicalization {{initiative for}} former militants, the Mishal Deradicalization and Emancipation Program (DREP). The Deradicalization program was launched following {{a military operation}} in 2009 against the Pakistan wing of the Taliban, namely, the <b>Tehrik-e-Taliban</b> <b>Pakistan</b> (TTP). The program aimed to deradicalize and rehabilitate arrested militants, with what officials claim is a 99 percent success rate and with more than 2, 500 former Taliban fighters now ‘reformed’. The program abides by a ‘no blood on hand’ policy, whereby it only takes in militants who have not caused any bodily harm to others. In this paper, we analyze the deradicalization program and highlight the limits and challenges it faces. The paper also highlights the common individual and environmental factors among the beneficiary population of the deradicalization program. This study finds that most participants of the program belonged to large or broken families with weak socio-economic profiles. Additionally, these individuals had very little technical knowledge of religion. This study also finds that the program is more oriented towards re-integration rather than deradicalization due to its policy of inducting only low and mid-level cadre militants. The program also has other severe limitations including lack of credible religious scholars, limited financial and human resources...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Pakistan {{ranks among the}} top recipients of U. S. foreign aid in the world, yet accounts for nearly 20 percent of the terrorist groups identified on the U. S. State Department Bureau of Counterterrorism Foreign Terrorist Organizations list. As a major non-NATO ally and valued U. S. partner in the Global War on Terrorism, Pakistan thus gives the appearance of being ineffective {{in its efforts to}} defeat Islamic extremism and militancy. This study aims to discover how the United States can better assist Pakistan to marginalize select militant Islamic groups that threaten regional and international security. Specifically, it investigates three possible strategies for mitigating violent extremism: counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, and foreign aid. These strategies are used to analyze U. S. and Pakistani efforts to marginalize four terrorist groups since 2001 : the Haqqani Network, Lashkar-e- Tayyiba, Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, and <b>Tehrik-e-Taliban</b> <b>Pakistan.</b> This study offers suggestions for the United States and Pakistan to counter the effects of select militant Islamic groups through improved counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, and foreign aid strategies. Additionally, this study provides general recommendations for enhancing the U. S. -Pakistan relationship by improving Pakistani security forces capabilities, disbursement of reliable U. S. foreign aid for economic development, and encouragement of Pakistans democratization process. Major, United States Arm...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how Islamist publications represent {{the history of}} Pakistan as a story of betrayal by the country’s leaders. These publications emphasize that the very ideology which forms the basis of Pakistan has been sidelined. I contend that this imagining of an Islamic state is not inconsistent with liberal ideology. Through an examination of critical histories of Pakistan, I show how these organizations are formed within {{the politics of the}} postcolonial state. Adapting Homi Bhabha’s (1994) theorization of ambivalence, I argue that Islamist organizations are actually the ‘slippage’ of liberalism in Pakistan. While Islamists call for an Islamic system, they imagine change within a legal framework and operate within the parameters of the state. In fact, Islamists position themselves as intermediaries between liberals and militants, attempting to reform the former and integrate the latter. Islamists construct an interesting dualism within the political arena: on one side, they position the United States and subservient Pakistani leaders, and on the other, they place militant organizations such as the <b>Tehrik-e-Taliban</b> <b>Pakistan</b> (TTP) and Tehrik-e-Nafaz-Shariat-e-Mohammadi (TNSM). In the process, religious organizations become the spokespersons for Islamic politics in Pakistan, and the protectors of Islamic identity, taking over the role historically occupied by the liberal leadership...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this report}} {{is to get a}} better {{understanding}} of the Taliban movement and its role in the Afghan insurgency post- 2001. The approach to this is three-fold: First, the report discusses the nature of the Afghan insurgency as described in existing literature. The second part looks at the organizational characteristics of the largest and most well-known insurgent group in Afghanistan: the Taliban movement (or Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, IEA) led by Mullah Omar. The third and most extensive part of the report analyses the Taliban leadership’s ideology and worldview, based on the official statements of its organization and leaders. The report argues that the Taliban sees itself as a nationalist-religious movement, which fights mainly to resurrect the Taliban regime of the 1990 s and to bring the various ethnic groups of Afghanistan under its rule. The Taliban’s agenda differs from that of its foreign allies (al-Qaida, Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, <b>Tehrik-e-Taliban</b> <b>Pakistan</b> and others) because its primary concern is fighting for Islam within the context of Afghanistan’s borders, while the foreign groups aim to spread their fight to other countries as well. Still, the Taliban appears to have a closer relationship with its foreign allies than with the other major insurgent leader in Afghanistan, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. In spite of their common goals (ending foreign occupation o...|$|E
40|$|On January 14, 2010, four Hellfire {{missiles}} {{fired from}} an {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (“drone”) slammed into a compound in Pakistan’s South Waziristan region, killing ten people. Hakimullah Mehsud, leader of <b>Tehrik-e-Taliban</b> <b>Pakistan</b> (“TTP”), was the reported target of the strike. Already the eighth US drone attack in Pakistan in 2010, these strikes followed two consecutive years of dramatically increased drone activity within Pakistan. Despite {{a high degree of}} media and scholarly interest in the United States’ use of drones in Pakistan, little attention has focused on whether the United States is engaged in an armed conflict in Pakistan, as defined and categorized by international humanitarian law (“IHL”). Instead, most analyses consider the efficacy of the campaign or the legality of the use of force and, in particular, the use of drones for so-called targeted killings. The primary debate has centered on whether the United States is acting lawfully in self-defense and presumes that the US drone campaign in Pakistan is an extension of either the NATO campaign in Afghanistan or the broader US conflict with Al Qaeda. Those who argue that the US drone attacks do not qualify as self-defense thus find that the United States is in violation of the international law governing the resort to force (jus ad bellum), and add that Pakistan has not specifically requested US support against militants within Pakistan. In contrast, some argue that the US drone campaign is justifiable self-defense, but suggest that actions taken in self defense by a state against a nonstate actor do not necessarily result in an armed conflict. Kenneth Anderson, in particular, views the drone campaign through a lens of self-defense and sees each drone strike as a discrete self-defense event. The report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Killings addresses the parameters and definition of armed conflict in analyzing the legality of the drone strikes, but does not reach a definitive conclusion regarding the existence or nature of the conflict in Pakistan. However, it is unsatisfactory to simply dismiss each drone strike as a discrete self-defense response—thus obviating the need to examine whether the United States is in an armed conflict in Pakistan—without examining whether the whole of the campaign might {{rise to the level of}} an armed conflict. The level of violence attending the drone campaign, the increasing rate of drone strikes since 2008, the drone campaign’s focus on the TTP, and the ongoing hostilities between Pakistan and the TTP all combine to make an assessment of the existence and nature of an armed conflict critical at this juncture. Moreover, the existence of armed conflict triggers the application of international humanitarian law, otherwise known as the law of armed conflict or the law of war. The law of armed conflict governs the conduct of both states and individuals during armed conflict and seeks to minimize suffering in war by protecting persons not participating in hostilities and by restricting the means and methods of warfare. This Article examines whether the United States is engaged in an armed conflict—as defined by IHL—with the TTP in Pakistan, and if so, explores the nature of that engagement. Part I provides background information on the TTP and other militant groups; the development and current state of hostilities between Pakistan and the TTP; and the US drone campaign in Pakistan, particularly against targets linked to the TTP. Part II applies the legal framework of armed conflict to the situation in Pakistan. After setting forth the definition and elements of armed conflict, this Part analyzes the nature of the conflict between Pakistan and the TTP. Finally, Part III examines US involvement in the conflict in Pakistan to assess whether it constitutes an intervention in an ongoing conflict or a separate parallel conflict and how such determinations might affect the applicable law...|$|E
