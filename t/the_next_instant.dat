25|$|The {{motion of}} a body can only be {{described}} relative to something elseother bodies, observers, or a set of space-time coordinates. These are called frames of reference. If the coordinates are chosen badly, the laws of motion may be more complex than necessary. For example, suppose a free body that has no external forces acting on it is at rest at some instant. In many coordinate systems, it would begin to move at <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>instant,</b> even though there are no forces on it. However, a frame of reference can always be chosen in which it remains stationary. Similarly, if space is not described uniformly or time independently, a coordinate system could describe the simple flight of a free body in space as a complicated zig-zag in its coordinate system. Indeed, an intuitive summary of inertial frames can be given as: In an inertial reference frame, the laws of mechanics take their simplest form.|$|E

Howell {{testified that}} after the fire began, Kehoe warned him and three boys to leave the farm, saying [...] "Boys, you are my friends, you {{better get out of}} here, you better go down to the school."

To match {{the speed of}} the aircraft from their sideways approach, the objects displayed what Terauchi described as a disregard for inertia: [...] "The thing was flying as if {{there was no such thing}} as gravity.
