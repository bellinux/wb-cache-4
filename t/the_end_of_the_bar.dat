25|$|The {{destruction}} date {{according to}} the Hebrew calendar was the 9th of Av, also known as Tisha B'Av. The Temple itself was located {{on the site of}} what today is the Dome of the Rock. The gates let out close to Al-Aqsa Mosque (which came much later). Although Jews continued to inhabit the destroyed city, Emperor Hadrian established a new city called Aelia Capitolina. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Kokhba revolt in 135 CE, many of the Jewish communities were massacred and Jews were banned from living inside Jerusalem. A pagan Roman temple was set up on the former site of Herod's Temple.|$|E
25|$|Following the Temple's {{destruction}} {{at the end}} of the First Jewish Revolt and {{the displacement}} to the Galilee of the bulk of the remaining Jewish population in Judea at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Kochva Revolt, Jewish tradition in the Talmud and poems from the period record that the descendants of each priestly watch established a separate residential seat in towns and villages of the Galilee, and maintained this residential pattern for at least several centuries in anticipation of the reconstruction of the Temple and reinstitution of the cycle of priestly courses. Specifically, this kohanic settlement region stretched from the Beit Netofa Valley, through the Nazareth region to Arbel and the vicinity of Tiberias. In subsequent years, there was a custom of publicly recalling every Sabbath in the synagogues the courses of the priests, a practice that reinforced the prestige of the priests' lineage.|$|E

60|$|Eyes {{centered}} on him, and silence began to fall. He tried to speak, {{pulled off his}} mittens (which fell dangling from their cords), and clawed at the frozen moisture of his breath which had formed in fifty miles of running.

60|$|This {{method of}} jamming and {{struggling}} {{in front of}} the bar was too slow for us. The drink was ours. The politicians had bought it for us. We'd paraded and earned it, hadn't we?

60|$|But Martin turned away, {{leaving him}} to tell it to the barkeeper, until that worthy was called away to furnish drinks to two farmers who, coming in, {{accepted}} Martin's invitation.

60|$|Then, {{when the}} needle was still, {{he brought up}} {{the middle of the}} magnet very near to the needle; but it did not move towards it at all. Then he drew the magnet along towards himself, keeping it at the same {{distance}} from the needle, and when <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> came opposite to the needle, it immediately leaped out of its place, and adhered strongly to it.|$|E
60|$|The saloon was small, {{and in its}} {{atmosphere}} the odours of {{meat and}} drink struggled for the ascendancy. The pig and the cabbage wrestled with hydrogen and oxygen. Behind the bar Schwegel laboured with an assistant whose epidermal pores {{showed no signs of}} being obstructed. Hot weinerwurst and sauerkraut were being served to purchasers of beer. Curly shuffled to <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> coughed hollowly, and told Schwegel that he was a Detroit cabinet-maker out of a job.|$|E
60|$|So he laid a small {{nail down}} upon the table, and then touched {{the middle of the}} magnet to the nail. It was not {{attracted}} at all. Then he moved it along a little, towards one end, and touched it again. Still it was not attracted.

60|$|Petey McGuff was {{the name}} of this creature. He was an oldish and wicked man, born on the Bowery. He had been a heavy-weight prize-fighter in the days of John L. Sullivan; then he had met John, and been, ever since, an honest crook who made an {{excellent}} living by conducting a boxing-school in which the real work was done by assistants. He resembled a hound with a neat black bow tie, and he drooled tobacco-juice down his big, raw-looking, moist, bristly, too-masculine chin. Every evening from eleven to midnight Petey McGuff sat at the round table in the mildewed corner at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> drinking old-fashioned whisky cocktails made with Bourbon, playing Canfield, staring at the nude models pasted on the milky surface of an old mirror, and teasing Carl.|$|E
60|$|They passed on, {{after looking}} at the axle for a few minutes, until {{they came to a}} part of the {{building}} where rails were being forged. This also, although not done by hammer, was a striking process. The place was so hot owing to the quantity of uncooled metal on the floor, that {{it was not possible to}} remain long; they therefore took a rapid survey. In one place several men were in the act of conveying to the steam-hammer a mass of shapeless white-hot iron, which had just been plucked from a furnace with a pair of grippers. They put it below the hammer for a few minutes, which soon reduced it to a clumsy bar; then they carried it to a pair of iron rollers driven by steam. <b>The</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> being presented to these, it was gripped, dragged in between them, and passed out at the other side, flat and very much lengthened, as well as thinned. Having been further reduced by this process, it was finally passed through a pair of rollers, which gave it shape, and sent it out a complete rail, ready to be laid down on the line.|$|E
