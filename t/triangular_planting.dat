50|$|There are two markers on {{the long}} walk commemorating presidential visits. The first, commemorating a 1954 visit by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, is marked in a Greek {{inscription}} within a <b>triangular</b> <b>planting</b> and is located in front of Downes Memorial Clock Tower. The second marker, commemorating the 1918 visit of President Theodore Roosevelt, is midway down the Long Walk and adjacent to the Fuller Arch and the Wall of Honor. The Latin inscription {{is embedded in the}} sidewalk in front of Northam Tower. Tradition has it that any student who walk on the plaque will not graduate from Trinity. When graduating seniors process at commencement, they all walk on this plaque.|$|E

Sativa L.). Treatment consisted of two N-fertilizer placement methods-surface and deep placement, and four planting patterns-surface, rectangular, triangular and hexagonal laid out in a Randomised Complete Block Design (RCBD), replicated three times. Deep placement of N-fertilizer resulted in significantly higher crop growth rates, days to 50 % flowering, grain weight per panicle, 1000 grain weights, grain yield, number of ear bearing tillers, percent filled grains, and plant height. The hexagonal and <b>triangular</b> <b>planting</b> patterns were statistically superior to the rectangular pattern in terms of crop growth rate, grain yield, number of ear-bearing tillers and plant height...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to find out the effects of herbicides types used in weed control against sweet corn growth and production on a <b>triangular</b> <b>planting</b> system. The experiment has been conducted at the Experimental Farm of the Faculty of Agriculture, Riau University, Soil Laboratory agricultural faculty, and Botani Laboratory FMIPA Riau University from December 2016 to March 2017.

40|$|This {{paper is}} about optimal control {{problems}} {{in which the}} controller must satisfy sparsity structure constraints. Conditions are derived under which the optimal controller associated to an unconstrained quadratic performance index is naturally structured and, as a consequence, the sparsity constraint imposed on the controller has {{no impact on the}} optimal loop performance. The results are then applied to study the control of <b>triangular</b> <b>plants</b> that have to be controlled by triangular controllers. We derive explicit characterisations of the Youla parameter that defines an optimal triangular controller and of the performance loss associated to the structural restriction imposed on the controller. ...|$|R
5000|$|The oldest {{part was}} built by the De Pontibus family and {{dates back to the}} 13th century; it is a Norman-Swabian {{enclosure}} castle with a structure similar to many other fortifications in the area of L'Aquila, like Castle of San Pio delle Camere. The structure of the castle was based on a pentagonal tower placed at the higher top and a wall with a <b>triangular</b> <b>plant</b> leading down to the valley. Historical sources confirm the existence of this castle (named [...] "castrum Sculcule") during the battle of Tagliacozzo in 1268 between Conradin and Charles I of Naples.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of obtaining a stable {{triangular}} approximation for a linear, square, stable, discrete-time MIMO system. We solve this problem through an analytic procedure that yields an explicit solution of a convex optimization problem. The optimized quantity is the L 2 norm of the relative modelling error. An interesting feature of the proposed methodology is that, if the MIMO system has nonminimum phase zeros near the stability boundary, then the derived approximation has, at least, a set of zeros close to them. The usefulness of our result comes mainly from its use as nominal model in triangular controller design procedures based on a <b>triangular</b> <b>plant</b> model...|$|R
40|$|International audienceModeling the {{deformation}} of 3 D plant {{is a challenge}} in computer graphics. This paper presents a simulation method for physically simulating interactive {{deformation of}} 3 D plant models. This method creates a tetrahedral mesh from the initial <b>triangular</b> <b>plant</b> model, the tetrahedral mesh is then used for dynamic response calculation of collision or interaction, the original triangular mesh is deformed along with the tetrahedral mesh. A capsule-based method and a spatial hashing based method are used for efficient and accurate collision detection. Smooth deformation effects and real-time simulation on 3 D plant models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} the proposed method can handle the geometric complexity of various plants by a simple model...|$|R

Speed response parameter of the internal model controller is tuned to increase from low to high value. The performance of the controller with time delay is observed. Triangular dither signal is injected into the controller to avoid the limit cycle oscillation. The different values of speed response are plotted using Matlab/Simulink and the dynamic behavior is studied and it is presented.

40|$|Spatial {{patterns}} of sibling plants constitute unique microcosms {{for the study}} of plant population biology. I have developed the thesis that aspects of seed dispersal patterns may be predicted from a knowledge of parent plant architecture and that seed dispersal patterns may be used, in turn, to predict {{patterns of}} surviving offspring. Individuals from six distinct biotypes of Panicum miliaceum L. (Poaceae) were grown in three crop environments: oats, soybeans, and corn. Seed dispersal patterns and patterns of mature offspring were mapped using a contiguous grid of <b>triangular</b> sections. <b>Plant</b> architecture was described in terms of the spatial positions of the infructescences on each plant. Seed production and the morphology, palatability, and tannin chemistry of seeds were determined for every combination of biotype and crop environment.;Architectural characteristics (the height, lateral spread, and orientation of infructescences) were well correlated with both univariate and multivariate descriptions of seed dispersal patterns. Mean dispersal distance scaled to plant height in a power function relationship with an exponent of 0. 67. This exponent did not differ significantly (p 3 ̆e 0. 05) from the value of 0. 75 derived from an analytical model and an analysis of published data {{from a wide range of}} plants. In the latter analysis, propagule shape and size did not contribute significantly (p 3 ̆e 0. 05) to the prediction of mean dispersal distance.;The distance between a parent and a cohort of its offspring increased over the course of the cohort 2 ̆ 7 s life cycle. Only cases with small sample sizes showed no significant (p 3 ̆e 0. 05) increase in cohort distance. The equivocation of previous reviews of this subject was criticized. No strong evidence was found in the literature for rejecting the hypothesis that the probability of plant survival increases with distance from an isolated parent. Multivariate evidence was given in support of the hypothesis that a greater proportion of mature offspring occur at a greater distance from the parent given a higher level of seed production...|$|R
