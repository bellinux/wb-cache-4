5|$|After missing {{most of the}} 193435 {{domestic}} season due to injury, McCabe scored an unbeaten 189 in the Second <b>Test</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 193536 tour of South Africa, {{including a}} century in one session, taking Australia {{to the brink of}} a world record-breaking victory on a difficult final-day pitch in poor light before the match was called off. It was one of two Test centuries McCabe made on the tour. The following season, he made five fifties in the first four Tests before scoring a century to help Australia win the deciding final Test against the touring Englishmen. In the First <b>Test</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1938 tour of England, McCabe played what was regarded as his greatest innings, scoring 232 in four hours, including his last 72 in 28 minutes. Bradman regarded the innings as the greatest batting he ever saw. However, none of McCabe’s three most famous innings resulted in an Australian victory; he has a reputation of being at his best when Australia was in difficulty.|$|E

5|$|On 1 February 1930, the Queen's Park Oval hosted {{its first}} Test match. The second <b>Test</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MCC 1929–30 {{tour of the}} West Indies saw England under Les Ames defeat the West Indies under Errol Hunte thanks largely to a century by the England captain and a double-century by Patsy Hendren.

Hassett ended the season with a dominant 229 against South Australia, setting up an innings win, dwarfing the 222 and 166 made by his opponents combined.
