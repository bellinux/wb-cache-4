5000|$|<b>Tear</b> <b>tape</b> is {{attached}} to the inner surface of packaging: paper, paperboard, corrugated fiberboard or plastic film. It is used on common non-durable fast-moving consumer goods such as soft drinks, groceries or toiletries, as well as tobacco products such as cigarettes and cigars, to aid the opening of the packaging It is also used courier envelopes and corrugated boxes. Irrespective of the medium it is used on, <b>tear</b> <b>tape</b> serves as an easy opening device for the consumer, where it prevents the need for additional opening tools such as scissors or knives, or the use of excessive force and avoid wrap rage. <b>Tear</b> <b>tape</b> provides a guide on the tear area, thereby allowing for more precise opening which minimises product spillage ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presented}} a novel tape, {{which was used}} to open the corrugated cartons more easily and quickly. Structure of the <b>tear</b> <b>tape</b> consisted of backing materials (acrylic fibers), adhesive (acrylic pressure-sensitive adhesive) and release paper. Prepared tear tapes with different thickness, analyzed the influence of <b>tear</b> <b>tape</b> thickness on performance of open system and added them to the corrugated board, then tested the opening properties of the corrugated board above. The {{results indicate that the}} tape, with 0. 18 mm in thickness and about 25 mm in width, can split high quantitative corrugated board smoothly, the tensile strength for opening is 105 N at maximum, which means these tape can satisfy the needs of easy-to-open technique...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2013, HIM {{announced}} that Razor & Tie, Double Cross and Universal Music would handle distribution in North America, the UK and Ireland, and Europe respectively for the band's forthcoming album, which was {{financed by the}} band themselves. On 26 April 2013, HIM released their eight studio album <b>Tears</b> on <b>Tape,</b> which was once again produced by Hiili Hiilesmaa, and mixed by Tim Palmer. <b>Tears</b> on <b>Tape</b> charted in nine countries, peaking at number two in Finland and Germany, number seven in Austria, and at number fifteen in the US. The title-track, [...] "Into the Night" [...] and [...] "All Lips Go Blue" [...] were released as singles, all of which received music videos. The former two were directed by Stefan Lindfors, with whom the band had previously collaborated on the video for [...] "The Funeral of Hearts". HIM and Lindfors were later awarded [...] "Video of the Year" [...] for [...] "Into the Night", at Noisecreep's first annual Creepies Awards. <b>Tears</b> on <b>Tape</b> received mostly positive reviews, scoring 67 out of 100 at Metacritic. Classic Rock called the album [...] "a glorious return to form {{for one of the}} world's most peculiarly successful bands", which was echoed by Alternative Press, who stated that [...] "within HIM's impressive canon, it's among their best."

50|$|Heat {{activated}} tape {{is usually}} tack-free {{until it is}} activated by a heat source. It is sometimes used in packaging, for example, a <b>tear</b> strip <b>tape</b> for cigarette packs.

This type of tape is used often in the semiconductor industry.|$|R
40|$|The {{methods of}} collage {{are full of}} meaning. In the years {{succeeding}} the ‘golden age’ of Cubist collage, the eminent twentieth century art critic Clement Greenberg wrote an essay that defined collage as cutting and pasting “a piece of extraneous material {{to the surface of}} [a] picture. ” Greenberg and contemporary scholars have seemingly ignored a closer examination of the processes of collage and its larger consequences in artistic practice. Analysts overlook the fundamental question of ‘how’ an object is constructed, opting to endlessly scrutinize the completed product. The processes of collage may be as important, if not more important than the result. It is in the result that the collaging process is referenced; <b>tearing,</b> <b>taping,</b> and affixing are clearly detectable. To investigate the procedural gestures of collage expands and amplifies its narrow, formalist dimensions. The primordial cut is one neglected gesture, first employed in an artistic context over one-thousand years ago. A focus on the act of cutting unearths a fruitful dialogue of collage strategies while broadening and redefining our relatively limited definitions of collage...|$|R

5000|$|Some PSA {{tapes are}} {{available}} {{which have a}} highly oriented polypropylene backing with high strength in the long (machine) direction.

2500|$|On {{their debut}} album, Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666, HIM's sound {{was viewed as}} a {{combination}} of heavy metal and 1980s rock and goth music. These influences were further explored on Razorblade Romance, which featured less focus on guitar, in favor of a sleeker production and a more melodic sound. HIM continued to explore a more commercial sound on their third album Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights, which was met with mixed reactions. HIM's fourth album Love Metal is widely viewed by the band as the album where they found their own sound, taking inspiration from old favorites, such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Iggy Pop. Dark Light was the band's breakthrough album in the United States, and once again featured a glossier production. According to Valo, 2007's Venus Doom was written with the intent of creating a much heavier and darker follow-up, influenced by more early favorites such as My Dying Bride, Anathema and Paradise Lost. [...] took influences from bands of the 1980s, such as a-ha, Depeche Mode and The Cult, [...] while <b>Tears</b> on <b>Tape</b> saw HIM returning to their roots, combining elements from their sound on each song, as opposed to having [...] "a fast song followed by a slow song". Valo described <b>Tears</b> on <b>Tape</b> as a combination of Black Sabbath, The Smashing Pumpkins and Roy Orbison.|$|R

5000|$|The three biggest {{problems}} with paper tape were: * Reliability. It was common practice to follow each mechanical copying of a tape with a manual hole-by-hole comparison.* Rewinding {{the tape was}} difficult and prone to problems. Great care was needed to avoid <b>tearing</b> the <b>tape.</b> Some systems used fanfold paper tape rather than rolled paper tape. In these systems, no rewinding was necessary nor were any fancy supply reel, takeup reel, or tension arm mechanisms required; the tape merely fed from the supply tank through the reader to the takeup tank, refolding itself back into exactly the same form as when it was fed into the reader.* Low information density.
