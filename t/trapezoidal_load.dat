In the {{previous}} paper regarding the somato-sensory {{control of the}} human precision grip, we concluded that the elicited automatic grip force adjustments are graded by the amplitude of the imposed loads when restraining an 'active 7 object subjected to unpredictable pulling forces (Johansson et al. 1992 a).

U 720 Li and microstructural variants of U 720 Li, i. e. U 720 Li-LG (large grain variant) and U 720 Li-LP (large intragranular coherent g' precipitate variant) have been assessed by uninterrupted and replicated short crack tests in polished U-notch specimens using a 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>loading</b> cycle at nominal stress levels ranging between 700 and 850 MPa (calculated in the uncracked ligament).

While well established for time independent behavior, {{the presence of a}} time dependent behavior can strongly affect both the loading and the unloading responses. The paper presents a framework of viscoelastic indentation analysis based on the method of functional equations, developed by Lee and Radok [1960, The contact problem for viscoelastic bodies, J.

40|$|Inconel 617 is a {{candidate}} material {{for use in the}} intermediate heat exchanger of the Next Generation Nuclear Plant. Because of the high temperatures and the fluctuations in stress and temperature, the fatigue behavior of the material is important to understand. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the influences of the microstructure during fatigue crack propagation. For this investigation, Inconel 617 compact tension samples, fatigue tested by Julian Benz at the Idaho National Laboratory, were obtained. The testing conditions included two environments at 650 °C (lab air and impure-He) and varied testing parameters including: <b>loading</b> waveform (triangular, <b>trapezoidal),</b> <b>loading</b> frequency (0. 01, 0. 05 Hz), and maximum stress intensity factor, Kmax (20, 25, 30 MPa√m). The value of Kmax had the greatest influence in the crack growth rate followed by the testing environment. In this study, electron backscatter diffraction was used in order to relate the crack path to the microstructure on the scale of microns. Using this information the crack was found to crack in the { 001 } family of planes and to the family of directions with the least propensity to propagate in the family of directions. This supports that crack growth in Inconel 617 at 650 °C propagates with a ‘quasi-cleavage’ mechanism. Also in this study it was found that the character of fatigue crack deflections within a grain versus that at a grain boundary differs with statistical significance. Within a grain, the deflection angle had a unimodal distribution with a mean of 16 ° ± 15 °. The low angle of deflection suggests that the plane of highest stress is the highest influencing factor. Also, the deflections at the grain boundary were found to have a different distribution as it was multimodal, which suggests multiple mechanisms for fatigue crack deflection. Though, the fatigue crack growth rate was found to be highly influenced by the testing atmosphere and loading parameters, they were found to have no statistical significance on the fatigue crack path on the microstructural level. At these testing conditions, the crack grew at a rate slow enough for the microstructure to have influence on its path, though it was still constrained to remain close to the plane of highest stress. Developing a deeper understanding of the influence of microstructure on fatigue crack propagation will support selection of materials and design of the intermediate heat exchanger for the next generation nuclear plant...|$|R

These past few years, {{a limited number of}} cases of intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) have been detected in cold worked areas of non sensitized austenitic stainless steel components. A first study has been initiated at EDF to assess the conditions of the cracking. The main results include cold work thresholds of 240 HV 0, 1 for initiation cracking, and of 310 HV 0, 1 for crack propagation, and propose that a dynamic loading is necessary for SCC. The aim of the present paper is to provide a basis of a crack propagation model by investigating the effect of loading, material and cold-work. In order to try to approach a static <b>loading,</b> a <b>trapezoidal</b> cyclic <b>loading</b> is applied on high cold-worked (by rolling or by tensile loading) materials. It is shown that, for the most severe loading, the rolling cold-worked (RCW) materials undergo TGSCC whereas IGSCC is observed after tensile cold-working (TCW). The ratio of loading R has such a strong impact on the crack growth rate (CGR) that it modifies the mechanism of cracking. Moreover, we notice that CGR increases with the applied Kmax but this evolution depends on the R value. Therefore, ∆K is chosen to represent the mechanical loading effects on CGRs. Finally, the CGR after a hold time of 1 hour is quite the same than for 3 hours.

The behaviour is not deeply affected by temperature in the range 100 - 130 °C. However, at 160 °C, crack growth rates are faster than at 130 °C due to an increase of creep contribution in local stress-strain response, that might be enhanced by ageing. In fatigue (triangular wave loading), no difference is noticed in crack growth rates at 20 and 130 °C. In creep-fatigue, the crack growth rates (<b>trapezoidal</b> wave <b>loading)</b> at 130 °C are faster than during creep or fatigue crack growth in a given domain of K. The fracture surfaces indicate that creepfatigue interaction is characterised by a higher portion of intergranular fracture. Thus, a detrimental creep-fatigue interaction at 130 °C has {{to be taken into account}} in crack propagation law used in damage tolerance analysis. The constitutive law used in the calculations for numerical simulation was identified on the basis of cyclic relaxation tests. The computation results indicate that the von Mises stress at the beginning of dwell during creep-fatigue is higher than in the case of creep and fatigue...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} sulfur on the {{corrosion}} fatigue crack growth of {{austenitic stainless steel}} was evaluated under Light Water Reactor (LWR) conditions of 288 °C deaerated (less than 5 ppb O₂) water, {{to shed light on}} the accelerating effect of the LWR environment and to explore the effect of high sulfur content on the retardation of fatigue crack growth rates. Fatigue tests were performed using a <b>trapezoidal</b> <b>loading</b> pattern with rise times of 5. 1, 51, 510, and 5100 seconds (fall time of 0. 9, 9, 90, and 900 seconds), with Kmzx of 28. 6 or 31. 9 MPa[mathematical symbol]m and stress ratios (R, Pmin/Pmax) of 0. 4 or 0. 7. Two test materials were used to evaluate the effect of sulfur: (1) a low sulfur (< 0. 0025 wt%) stainless steel and, (2) a high sulfur (0. 032 wt% stainless steel. The low sulfur stainless steel exhibited increasing crack growth rates from 9. 4 x 10 - 5 mm/cycle to 1. 2 x 1 0 -⁴ mm/cycle as rise times were increased from 5. 1 to 5100 seconds with a stress ratio of 0. 7. The high sulfur stainless steel exhibited decreasing crack growth rates from 1. 4 x 10 -⁴ mm/cycle to 7. 9 x 10 -⁵ mm/cycle as rise times were increased for a stress ratio of 0. 4, and crack growth rates from 6. 4 x 10 5 mm/cycle to 3. 6 x 10 -⁵ mm/cycle with increasing rise time at a stress ratio of 0. 7. Evaluation of the crack growth rates showed environmental enhancement of the crack growth rates for the low sulfur stainless steel, while the high sulfur stainless steel showed retardation of environmental crack growth rates, likely due to the increased corrosion at the crack tip associated with the high sulfur content. The crack surfaces were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The low sulfur material showed a light layer of corrosion product that decreased in thickness as the testing progressed, and faceting on the surface was highly crystallographic. Faceting ran both perpendicular and parallel to the crack for the short rise time steps of the test, but fewer perpendicular facets were evident at the longer rise times. The high sulfur material was heavily corroded throughout the fracture surface, and crystallographic faceting was seen for stages of the test with R= 0. 4 For R= 0. 7, the heavy oxidation on the surface made the facets hard to resolve. Striations were apparent during the 5100 second rise time for the low sulfur material (where corrosion was almost nonexistent) and throughout the entirety of the crack surface for the high sulfur material. Materials were also characterized by optical microscopy. The low sulfur material showed pitting along the grain boundaries, due to the boron concentration in this material, which resulted in boron precipitates, while the high sulfur material showed pitting throughout the surface, due to the MnS inclusions. Electrochemical tests were also performed at room temperature on both materials in pH 4 (using H₂SO₄), 7, and 10 (using NH₄OH). Peaks in the passive region of the high sulfur material were seen at potentials of 160, 630, and 1400 mVSHE, due to dissolution of the MnS inclusions. The results suggest that the high sulfur material provides an increase in corrosion when exposed to the environment, which leads to the retardation of crack growth rates at the longer rise times due to prolonged exposure of the crack tip to the environment. At low stress ratios, the proposed mechanism for retardation of crack growth rates is crack tip closure, due to a buildup of corrosion product at the fracture surface, which lowers the effective load that the crack tip experiences. At high stress ratios, the proposed mechanism for retardation is an increased in injected vacancies and enhanced creep, which disrupt the slip bands ahead of the crack tip, reducing the crack tip stresses. Fractography of the fracture surface and crack growth rate comparisons of the low and high sulfur material provide supportive evidence for the proposed mechanisms, and further work is proposed to examine the effect of increased corrosion ahead of the crack tip. by Lindsay Beth O'Brien.
