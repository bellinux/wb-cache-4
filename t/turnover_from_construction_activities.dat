This paper aims to present a geographic information systems (GIS) and computer-aided design (CAD) -based approach for visualizing, communicating and analysing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting <b>from</b> <b>construction</b> <b>activities.</b> Design/methodology/approach – A methodology using GIS is developed to graphically represent spatial aspects of construction. The approach adopted involves use of a 3 D model developed in CAD environment, which was synchronized with a construction schedule stored in Excel spreadsheets. GIS environment is used to link spatial and scheduling information relevant to GHG emissions <b>from</b> <b>construction</b> <b>activities.</b> Abaseline was created to enable effective monitoring of construction emissions. Findings – The presented GIS model has the potential to enhance visualisation of distribution and dynamic variations of GHG emissions and could help stakeholders better analyse and understand how <b>construction</b> <b>activities</b> impact the environment. Originality/value – This paper presents a novel method of graphically presenting GHG and other hazardous air emissions <b>from</b> <b>construction</b> <b>activities</b> using a GIS-based approach.

40|$|The {{identification}} and characterization of particulate matter (PM) concentrations <b>from</b> <b>construction</b> site <b>activities</b> pose major challenges {{due to the}} diverse characteristics related to different aspects, such as concentration, particle size and particle composition. Moreover, the characterization of particulate matter is influenced by meteorological conditions, including temperature, humidity, rainfall and wind speed. This paper {{is part of a}} broader investigation that aims to develop a methodology for assessing the environmental impacts caused by the PM emissions that arise <b>from</b> <b>construction</b> <b>activities.</b> The objective {{of this paper is to}} identify and characterize the PM emissions on a construction site with different aerodynamic diameters (PM 2. 5, PM 10, total suspended particulates (TSP)), based on an exploratory study. Initially, a protocol was developed to standardize the construction site selection criteria, laboratory procedures, field sample collection and laboratory analysis. This protocol was applied on a multifamily residential building construction site during three different construction phases (earthworks, superstructure and finishings) aimed at measuring and monitoring PM concentrations arising <b>from</b> <b>construction</b> <b>activities.</b> The particulate matter was characterized in different particle sizes. Results showed that the higher TSP emissions arising <b>from</b> <b>construction</b> <b>activities</b> provoked environmental impacts. Some limitations to the results were identified, especially with regards the need for a detailed investigation about the influence of different construction phases on PM emissions. The findings provided significant knowledge about various situations, serving as a basis for improving the existing methodology for particulate material collection on construction sites and the development of future studies on the specific construction site phases...|$|R

They were identified in this study based on the quarterly silt loading sampling data collected from 20 sites by the Clark County Department of Air Quality and Environmental Management in Southern Nevada for the period from 2000 to 2003. The silt-loading and associated data collected over these years at one sampling site may inherently possess site-specific characteristics that can be better incorporated by using panel data models.
