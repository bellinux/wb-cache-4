5|$|Bees are {{themselves}} Müllerian mimics of other aposematic insects {{with the same}} colour scheme, including wasps, lycid and other beetles, and many butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) which {{are themselves}} distasteful, often through acquiring bitter and poisonous chemicals from their plant food. All the Müllerian mimics, including bees, benefit from the reduced risk of predation <b>that</b> <b>results</b> from their easily recognised warning coloration.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{frequency}} offset (BFO) – The {{difference between the}} expected and received frequency of transmissions. The difference is caused by doppler shift as the signals travelled from the aircraft to the satellite to the ground station; the frequency translations made in the satellite and at the ground station; a small, constant error (bias) in the SDU <b>that</b> <b>results</b> from drift and ageing; and compensation applied by the SDU to counter the Doppler shift on the uplink. This measure can be analysed to determine where along the BTO rings the aircraft was located.|$|E

5|$|Einsteinium has a {{high rate}} of nuclear fission <b>that</b> <b>results</b> in a low {{critical}} mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This mass is 9.89 kilograms for a bare sphere of 254Es isotope, and can be lowered to 2.9 by adding a 30 centimeter thick steel neutron reflector, or even to 2.26 kilograms with a 20cm thick reflector made of water. However, even this small critical mass greatly exceeds the total amount of einsteinium isolated thus far, especially of the rare 254Es isotope.|$|E

This functional definition not only solves the problems of other definitions, but also has important advantages for cognitive learning research...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to hydrostatic equilibrium, {{the interior of}} a stable star will also maintain an energy balance of thermal equilibrium. There is a radial temperature gradient throughout the interior <b>that</b> <b>results</b> in a flux of energy flowing toward the exterior.

5|$|In massive stars, heavier {{elements}} {{can also}} be burned in a contracting core through the neon-burning process and oxygen-burning process.

5|$|Mustering is a {{labour-intensive}} process <b>that</b> <b>results</b> {{in one of}} {{two major}} outcomes: slaughter for sale, or relocation. It may be assisted by feed-luring in which bales of hay are strategically placed to attract feral horses to a location where capture is feasible. Complicating this process is low demand for the captured horses, making it less desirable than fertility control or shooting, which reduce the population without having to find alternative locations for them.|$|E

5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} is {{a disorder}} <b>that</b> <b>results</b> in {{pain in the}} heel {{and bottom of the}} foot. The pain is usually most severe with the first steps of the day or following a period of rest.

In about a third of people both legs are affected.|$|E
5|$|Prosody is {{the study}} of the meter, rhythm, and {{intonation}} of a poem. Rhythm and meter are different, although closely related. Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as iambic pentameter), while rhythm is the actual sound <b>that</b> <b>results</b> from a line of poetry. Prosody also may be used more specifically to refer to the scanning of poetic lines to show meter.|$|E

5|$|These direct pain inputs, {{as well as}} {{indirect}} inputs, {{are thought}} to induce long-term pain avoidance behavior <b>that</b> <b>results</b> in chronic posture changes and consequently, in functional and anatomical remodeling of vestibular and proprioceptive nuclei. As a result, chronic neuropathic pain can induce macroscopic anatomical remodeling of the hindbrain, including the cerebellum. The magnitude of this remodeling and the induction of neuron progenitor markers suggest the contribution of adult neurogenesis to these changes.|$|E
