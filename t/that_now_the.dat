The group is alleged to receive some $5 million worth of cash and weapons every month from Iran.

The original Convention of Peking (Beijing) states this section of the border lies along the Granitnaya, but the origin of the river de facto lay inside Russian territory.

[...] It also condemned the killings as [...] "brutal and inhuman" [...] and declared that [...] "people are running out of patience over the ignorance of foreign forces." [...] Abdul Rahim Ayobi, a member of parliament from Kandahar, said the shooting [...] "gives us the message <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> American soldiers are out of the control of their generals."

500|$|At the September 26 MSNBC debate, Biden {{explained}} {{how he would}} allow for Social security to last.

George Mitchell when we made that deal [...] I'll never forget Bob Dole turning to Pat Moynihan and saying, 'we all got to jump in this boat at the same time.' So the bottom line here is, you can't do it by growing the economy alone. So I would raise the cap." [...] Later in the debate Biden was one of three participants (along with Dodd and Richardson) who said they would ban smoking in public places.|$|E
500|$|For years, BLM {{had also}} allowed any horse {{to be adopted}} from the range. Since adopters favored [...] "pretty" [...] horses, the color {{genetics}} of the herd altered so that mostly bays and blacks were left on the range. Adoption procedures changed in 1994 so <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> original colors and patterns of the herd are returning. In 1992, a private group, the Pryor Mountains Mustang Breeders Association was formed to preserve the gene pool of the herd and establish a registry for Pryor Mountains horses in private hands. In order {{to be placed on}} the register, the horse must have a registered sire and dam, have a title issued either by BLM or the Tillett ranch, and have a certificate of blood typing from the Gluck Equine Research Center at the University of Kentucky. As of 2008, 209 horses in 16 U.S. states and one Canadian province were on the registry. BLM undertook a roundup of the horse herd in 1997 to reduce its numbers, and officials expected to do another in late 2000 when the herd size reached 200. By August 1999, there were 180 adult horses and colts on the range.|$|E

500|$|The inter-Allied cryptologic {{collaboration}} prevented {{duplication of}} effort and facilitated discoveries. Before fighting had started in Norway in April 1940, the Polish-French team solved an uncommonly hard three-letter code used by the Germans to communicate with fighter and bomber squadrons and for exchange of meteorological data between aircraft and land. [...] The code had first appeared in December 1939, but the Polish cryptologists had been too preoccupied with Enigma to give the code much attention. With the German assault on the west impending, however, {{the breaking of the}} Luftwaffe code took on mounting urgency. The trail of the elusive code (whose system of letters changed every 24 hours) led back to Enigma. The first clue came from the British, who had noticed that the code's letters did not change randomly. If A changed to P, then elsewhere P was replaced by A. The British made no further headway, but the Poles realized that what was manifesting was Enigma's exclusivity principle that they had discovered in 1932. The Germans' carelessness meant <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> Poles, having after midnight solved Enigma's daily setting, could with no further effort also read the Luftwaffe signals.|$|E
