50|$|When {{conditions}} warrant, a Hazardous Weather Outlook {{is issued}} (usually twice each day at around 7:00 a.m. and noon local time) {{by a local}} weather forecast office (WFO) addressing potentially hazardous weather or hydrologic events that may affect that WFO's area of responsibility {{over the next seven}} days. The outlook will include information about potential thunderstorm activity (including any areas forecast to be under threat of severe thunderstorms), heavy rain or flooding, winter weather, wildfire, extremes of heat or cold, or other conditions that may pose a hazard or threat to <b>travel,</b> <b>life</b> and/or property. It is intended to provide information to those who need considerable lead time to prepare for the event, along with a call for action for NWS-trained SKYWARN volunteer weather spotters to be prepared to report their local weather conditions and/or damage reports back to the local NWS office. Other outlooks are issued on an event-driven basis, such as the Flood Potential Outlook and Public Severe Weather Outlook. Occasionally, a NWS WFO may update the Hazardous Weather Outlook while an event is ongoing or if forecast models denote changes from previous forecasts.|$|E

40|$|Tourism {{research}} has long recognized {{the complexity of}} many decisions that tourists make and proposed models to describe and analyze tourist decision processes. This article complements this previous research by proposing a view that {{moves away from the}} process of making a decision and instead investigates how tourists mentally represent the decision problem. Mental representations of travel decision problems allow tourists to evaluate the decision utility of the different available alternatives before they are chosen. We discuss the modeling and measurement of tourists' mental representations of complex travel decision problems and provide directions for future research that focuses on the dynamics of tourist mental representations both within a single travel decision framework and over the tourist <b>travel</b> <b>life</b> cycle...|$|E
40|$|Little {{research}} has been published {{on the evolution of}} markets, but markets, like destinations, should evolve over time. A market's collective travel behavior should change as residents become more experienced international tourists. Market evolution may be triggered by rapid economic development. As Tourists become more experienced, their destination choice, travel patterns and package tour propensity should change. This paper compares the international travel patterns of similar source markets at different stages of their <b>travel</b> <b>life</b> cycles. Hong Kong can be considered as an established source market, whereas Macau is a rapidly emerging source market. The study identifies significant differences in destination choice, package tour propensity, long-haul travel propensity, motivations and behavior within destinations. The authors conclude the paper by offering a number of propositions about market evolution. School of Hotel and Tourism Managemen...|$|E
40|$|By {{describing}} {{and discussing}} Australian data on outbound travel, this paper investigates the bimodal life cycle pattern predicted/observed by Lawson (1991) and Becker (1992). These authorsâ€™ theories are primarily {{based on the}} demand for holiday travel, but travellers do not merely travel overseas for holiday purposes. Trips overseas by Australians are split into 6 groups based on the purpose for travel, enabling the age-related life cycles of each group to be examined separately. It is found that holiday travel is bimodal, but outbound business travel and travel to attend conventions and conferences is unimodal. Travel for education and to visit friends and relatives are both unimodal, but skewed in opposite directions and travel for short-term employment is almost symmetrical. Differences in <b>travel</b> <b>life</b> cycles occur according {{to the purpose of}} travel. Although Australian outbound travel is used for this study, it is expected that the general patterns observed should at least apply to other countries with a similar background...|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} {{number of}} studies have been made concerning life course variation in travel and leisure behaviour, often {{from the point of view}} of the <b>travel</b> <b>life</b> cycle. Whilst many facets of travel and leisure have been discussed, there is a quasi total lack of literature on the particular sector of holiday rentals, despite the importance of that sector. Given the demographic ageing currently taking place in many European countries, it becomes important not just to further pursue research on age as it relates to travel behaviour, but also to extend the analysis to other areas of tourism than those most frequently studied. In this paper we formulate a number of hypotheses concerning the willingness to pay for holiday rentals and travel preferences, which we subsequently test, using a survey of Swiss households. We find evidence to support our hypotheses and find significant differences between both non-seniors and seniors, as well as between younger and older seniors...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} attitude-behaviour gap from an {{identity}} perspective {{in order to}} better understand why tourists act sustainably at "home" but not when "away". The majority of tourism-related CO 2 emissions stems from transport. Behavioural change is a possible way to reduce those emissions. However, research indicates that instigating behavioural change within tourism is problematic, because of the attitude-behaviour gap. Studies suggest that understanding the role of identity and tourism mobility could explain this gap; this paper researches that idea, using a narrative approach to explore the <b>travel</b> <b>life</b> histories of 24 participants, with a second interview to examine how interviewees viewed their tourism activity in the light of environmental debates and concerns. Data were analysed using thematic and narrative-based dialogic/performance approaches. The paper reveals how a need for personal identity can influence travel behaviour and that identity plays a significant role in travel decisions, sometimes overriding cost and environmental issues. The power of social identity is explored, noting increasingly powerful global VFR networks, along with the search for future selves, the need for personal differentiation and issues of multiple identities. Suggestions are made for ways to use identity research into policies seeking to achieve behavioural change...|$|E

3000|$|Graburn and Nash, two {{important}} {{researchers in the}} anthropology of tourism, have debated these basic questions. Graburn (1977, 1983) suggests that tourism is a [...] "modern ritual" [...] in contemporary society. When people are away from home they are outside of their daily lives and in the <b>travel</b> <b>life,</b> which differs from routine work and life. When the travel ends people return to their previous daily life but {{with the experience of}} travel. Using Turner's classic analysis of pilgrimage, Graburn carries out the same structured treatment for tourism. Corresponding to Turner’s ritual theory of structure-antistructure-structure, Graburn divides the life of the tourist into three stages: secular work-divine travel-secular work. Not long after Graburn presented his view of tourism as a rite of passage, Nash {{came up with the idea}} that the purpose of travel, the attitude toward travel, and the traveler’s behavior vary from person to person, and not all kinds of travel are similar to pilgrimage. Graburn's points of view can thus be “a profitable way to analyze some tourism, but [...]... we should be wary about being trapped into any one conceptual scheme, particularly one that may be beginning to acquire a quality of truth in the minds of its proponents [...] " [...] (Nash 1984).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the extent to which {{everyday}} travel behaviour in Britain changes in relation to family responsibilities, and examines how this has altered over the past century and a half. It is argued that prior to the mid-twentieth century changes in the family such as increased child care responsibilities barely influenced the modes of transport used for everyday travel, but that increasingly in the later twentieth century people have adjusted their travel behaviour during the family formation phases of their life. In particular parents of young children have become more car-dependent and less likely to walk or cycle. Data are drawn from two separate projects, one that collected <b>travel</b> <b>life</b> histories from the past half century as context for research on cycling in later life, and one that uses personal diaries to reveal everyday mobility strategies of people in the nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. We argue that the observed changes are due not only to increased access to a wide range of different transport forms, especially the motor car, but also to changes in societal perceptions of risk and norms of travel behaviour. In conclusion, it is suggested that more awareness of past travel behaviours could aid the development and implementation of more sustainable transport policies in the UK...|$|E
40|$|To {{explore the}} impact of road {{injuries}} for different age groups, this study compares the health burden of road injuries in young adolescents– 12 to 17 years of age–to those for older age groups. Young adolescents are underrepresented in road fatalities. However, their inexperience, developmental stage and use of bicycles may expose them {{to high levels of}} road risk, but their physical resilience may help them survive injuries which in older age groups would be fatal. To assess {{the impact of}} injuries compared with death, this study assessed by age group the health burden expressed in disability adjusted life years; years of life lost plus years lived with disability. Its analyses make use of existing data bases on road fatalities, serious injuries (maximum abbreviated injury score 2 or more), <b>travel,</b> <b>life</b> expectancy and disability weights. For young adolescents, seriously injuries per distance travelled (injury risk) were higher than for any other age group, except for the elderly (75 +). This was further amplified when health burden was taken into account, showing these young adolescents to be responsible for 15 % of the total health burden associated with road crashes. These results justify extra efforts to improve the understanding and prevention of injury-only crashes among young adolescents. (Author/publisher...|$|E
