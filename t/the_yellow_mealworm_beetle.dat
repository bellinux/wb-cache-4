40|$|Abstract Measures of {{repeatability}} {{are essential}} for understanding behavioral consis-tency and individual differences in behavior, i. e. animal personalities. We studied anti-predator responses of <b>the</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle</b> (Tenebrio molitor) and performed behavioral tests in plastic containers representing a typical laboratory environment of T. molitor. Behavioral tests were repeated in Eppendorf test tubes where we also measured resting metabolic rate (RMR). Results show that the response latency to a threatening/startling stimulus, and the total {{time spent in the}} state of tonic immobility, correlated across the tests. The behavioral responses were repeatable and RMR covaried phenotypically with personality: we found a negative correlation between response latency time and time spent immobile, a positive correlation between response latency and RMR, and a negative correlation between RMR and total time spent immobile. These correlations were also similar across trials performed in the Eppendorf test tubes and the plastic containers...|$|E
40|$|Females that {{mate with}} more than one male may derive both {{material}} and genetic benefits, and differentiating between the two benefits is often difficult. We tested for both material and genetic effects associated with multiple mating in <b>the</b> highly promiscuous <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tenebrio molitor. Females that mated four times to the same male laid more eggs and produced more larvae than females that mated only once. Whether copulations occurred on the same day or over several days, the result was an immediate increase in the production of eggs by females. Some females were kept on a restricted diet to test whether nutrients in the spermatophore disproportionately benefitted food-deprived females. Although females on poor diets produced fewer and smaller offspring, diet did not significantly affect the proportional benefit of mating treatment on female fecundity. By controlling for male mating history, we were able to separate the effects of mating with different males from the effects of receiving multiple spermatophores from the same male. Females that mated with four different males achieved substantial gains in numbers of eggs produced (32 % increase) beyond those of females that mated an identical number of times with the same male. We found no evidence that males allocate fewer sperm to previous mates. Egg hatchability was unaffected by mating behavior, suggesting that genetic incompatibility at that stage is not responsible for the low reproductive success of females mated with a single male. These results suggest that females may delay or reduce oviposition or may be incapable of achieving maximal fecundity until they have gained the material and/or genetic benefits of mating with multiple males.

To date, limited information is available on the safety of insects, and toxic elements are one of the potential hazards of concern. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the potential accumulation of cadmium, lead and arsenic in larvae of two insect species, Tenebrio molitor (<b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm)</b> and Hermetia illucens (black soldier fly), which seem to hold {{potential as a}} source of food or feed. An experiment was designed with 14 treatments, each in triplicate, per insect species. Twelve treatments used feed that was spiked with cadmium, lead or arsenic at 0. 5, 1 and 2 times the respective maximum allowable levels (ML) in complete feed, as established by the European Commission (EC). Two of the 14 treatments consisted of controls, using non-spiked feed. All insects per container (replicate) were harvested when the first larva in that container had completed its larval stage. Development time, survival rates and fresh weights were similar over all treatments, except for development time and total live weight of the half of the maximum limit treatment for cadmium of the black soldier fly. Bioaccumulation (bioaccumulation factor > 1) was seen in all treatments (including two controls) for lead and cadmium in black soldier fly larvae, and for the three arsenic treatments in <b>the</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> larvae.

40|$|Laboratory bioassays were {{conducted}} to evaluate alpha-cypermethrin and thiamethoxam for the control of adults, small larvae and large larvae of the khapra beetle Trogoderma granarium, and <b>the</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle</b> Tenebrio molitor, on concrete. Factors such as dose (0. 025 and 0. 1 mg alpha-cypermethrin or thiamethoxam/cm(2)), exposure interval (1, 3 and 7 d), and formulation (alpha-cypermethrin SC and thiamethoxam WG) were evaluated. Apart from immediate assessment at end of exposure, an assessment of delayed mortality was performed with {{the survivors of the}} 7 -d exposure by removing them from the treated substrate and keeping them on untreated surfaces for 7 more days. After the 7 -d exposure, more T. granarium adults were dead on dishes treated with alpha-cypermethrin than with thiamethoxam. Small larvae were generally less susceptible than adults. After 7 d, small larval mortality reached 64. 4 % for alpha-cypermethrin, while for thiamethoxam it was < 6 %. Large T. granarium larvae were more tolerant than the small ones. Delayed mortality of T. granarium adults was generally high for both insecticides and doses, and ranged between 43. 3 and 63. 3 % of those that were still alive immediately after the 7 -d treatment. For both larval categories, delayed mortality was higher for larvae that had been previously exposed to alpha-cypermethrin, than with thiamethoxam. For T. molitor, after the 7 -d exposure, significantly more adults were dead on dishes treated with alpha-cypermethrin than with thiamethoxam. For small larvae mortality was 38. 9 % at the lowest thiamethoxam dose, but in the other cases ranged between 88. 9 and 95. 6 %. In the case of large larvae, the overall mortality was low in all tested combinations. Regarding delayed mortality of this species, it remained at low levels, for both adults and small larvae. Our results indicate that 7 : molitor was more susceptible than T. granarium in both insecticides tested, but alpha-cypermethrin was more effective than thiamethoxam. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These were offered to newly hatched Argentinean cockroaches, black soldier flies, <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworms,</b> and house crickets. The first two species are potentially interesting as a feed ingredient, while the latter two are considered edible for humans. Feed conversion efficiency, survival, development time, as well as chemical composition (nitrogen, phosphorus, and fatty acids), were determined. The Argentinean cockroaches and the black soldier flies converted feed more efficiently than <b>yellow</b> <b>mealworms,</b> and house crickets.

Comparative life cycle studies were conducted across several ontogenetic stages {{to provide an}} illustration {{of the nature of}} host specificity in the gregarine life cycle. Reciprocal cross-stadium experimental infections demonstrated that G. cuneata, G. polymorpha, and G. steini are restricted to larval T. molitor and G. niphandrodes are restricted to adult T. molitor. The exogenous developmental niches of G. niphandrodes, G. cuneata, and G. polymorpha were determined along temperature and humidity axes and associated with parasite niche space on the host resource axis. Gregarine gametocysts were incubated at controlled humidity (0, 10, and 20 mm Hg vapor pressure deficit) at 20, 25, 30, and 35 C to determine the environmental limits to survival and sporulation. Although the environmental conditions that permit gametocyst developmental overlap, G. niphandrodes utilize a subset of sporulation and survival conditions that are incompatible with the developmental needs of G. cuneata and G. polymorpha. Likewise, G. cuneata and G. polymorpha survive and sporulate under a subset of environmental conditions that are incompatible with the developmental needs of G. niphandrodes. The pattern of interspecific variation in the environmental tolerances of gregarine gametocysts is analogous to the pattern of interspecific variation in host stadium specificity observed in endogenous gregarine stages. The oocysts of G. niphandrodes, G. cuneata, and G. polymorpha were tested for variation in viability over time, variation in post-sporulation development, and for host stadium specific physiological cues that initiate exsporulation. There are no interspecific differences in oocyst viability over time, post-sporulation developmental timing in the oocyst, nor in the physiological cues that initiate oocyst exsporulation in the host gut. There is no evidence to suggest that any of these phenomena play a role in host stadium specificity.

For mealworms, the mesophilic counts ranged from 8. 3 to 8. 5 log cfu/g, psychrotrophs from 5. 8 to 6. 5, Enterobacteriaceae from 6. 8 to 6. 9, lactic acid bacteria from 7. 4 to 8. 2, yeasts and moulds from 4. 8 to 5. 3 and aerobic bacterial spores from 2. 3 to 4. 3. For crickets, numbers were between 8. 2 and 8. 4 log cfu/g for mesophiles, between 5. 0 to 5. 5 for psychrotrophs, between 7. 7 and 8. 0 for Enterobacteriaceae, between 7. 3 and 7. 9 for lactic acid bacteria, between 6. 0 and 6. 1 for yeast and moulds and between 2. 9 and 4. 2 for bacterial spores. Salmonella nor Listeria monocytogenes were detected in any of the samples. The largest differences between the rearing companies investigated were observed for the psychrotropic counts, lactic acid bacteria and bacterial spores. These differences likely result from varying rearing techniques, varying feeds and hygiene measurements.

Trophozoites of G. cuneata develop epicellularly, attached to the luminal side of the host epithelial cell by an epimerite exhibiting a high degree of morphological variability. The presence of contractile elements in the apical region of feeding stages indicates that trophozoite detachment from host tissue is an active process self-regulated by the parasite. A detailed discussion is provided on the possibility of reversible retraction and protraction of the eugregarine apical end, facilitating eventual reattachment to another host cell in better physiological conditions. The gamonts, found in contact with host tissue via a modified protomerite top, indicate further adaptation of parasite for nutrient acquisition via epicellular parasitism while keeping their host healthy. The presence of eugregarines in mealworm larvae even seems to increase the host growth rate and to reduce the death rate despite often heavy parasitisation. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Improved knowledge about the formation of host-parasite interactions in deep-branching apicomplexans, including gregarines, would offer significant insights into the fascinating biology and evolutionary strategy of Apicomplexa. Gregarines exhibit an enormous diversity in cell architecture and dimensions, depending on their parasitic strategy and the surrounding environment. They seem to be a perfect example of a coevolution between a group of parasites and their hosts...|$|R
50|$|Mealworms are {{the larvae}} of the <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle.</b> The larvae {{emerge from the}} ground roughly four to 19 days after the female beetle lays her eggs. The eggs and larva must be kept at a {{temperatures}} of 75 to 80 F. It {{is important that the}} worms have sufficient ventilation. The mealworms must be kept on a proper bedding of wheat middling and things such as maize, cornmeal, which provide nutrients. Mealworms feed on dead insects and organic matter. Farmers often add fruits and vegetables to provide moisture and make the larva more plump for consumption. Mealworms are consumed by humans baked, fried, or fresh. Mealworms are also used as fish and reptile feed.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 50% of {{the gray}} catbird's diet is fruit and berries. They also eat <b>mealworms,</b> earthworms, <b>beetles,</b> and other bugs. In summer, gray catbirds will eat mostly ants, beetles, grasshoppers, caterpillars, and moths. They also eat holly berries, cherries, elderberries, poison ivy, bay, and blackberries.|$|R
40|$|Encounters with parasites and {{pathogens}} {{are often}} unpredictable in time. However, experience of an infection {{may provide the}} host with reliable cues about the future risk of infection for the host itself or for its progeny. If the parental environment predicts {{the quality of the}} progeny's environment, then parents may further enhance their net reproductive success by differentially providing their offspring with phenotypes to cope with potential hazards such as pathogen infection. Here, I test for the occurrence of such an adaptive transgenerational phenotypic plasticity in the <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tenebrio molitor. A pathogenic environment was mimicked by injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharides for two generations of insects. I found that parental challenge enhanced offspring immunity through the inducible production of antimicrobial peptides in the haemolymph...|$|R
40|$|A cDNA of alpha alpha-trehalase (EC 3. 2. 1. 28) from a cDNA {{library of}} male bean-shaped {{accessory}} gland of the <b>mealworm</b> <b>beetle,</b> Tenebrio molitor, has been isolated by the homology screening approach. Sequence {{analysis of the}} cDNA (1830 bp) revealed that the cDNA encoded a protein of 555 amino acids with a calculated M(r) of 64457. The deduced amino acid sequence had significant similarities to rabbit small intestine and Escherichia coli trehalases. Northern blotting and semi-quantitative PCR analyses revealed that a trehalase transcript with about 2. 0 kb was abundant in bean-shaped accessory glands. In the glands, the amount of trehalase transcript increased from 1 to 2 days after adult ecdysis. These tissue- and stage-specific gene expressions of trehalase corresponded to the tissue- and stage-specificity of trehalase activity...|$|R
