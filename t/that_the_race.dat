5|$|On {{the next}} racing day, the other riders were {{reluctant}} to continue racing and asked the organisers for a postponement. French rider Jean Stablinski suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> continue, with a British rider, whose team would wear black armbands, allowed to win the stage. Barry Hoban won the stage, This was later a subject of argument as it was widely believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> winner should have been Denson, Simpson's other teammate and close friend.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a strong}} belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> would be a battle between Carrera Jeans–Vagabond {{teammates}} Visentini and Roche. El Mundo Deportivo stated that Visentini had the edge in the time trial discipline and sprinting, while Roche had the advantage in climbing mountains. However, unlike Visentini, Roche came into the race in great shape after winning the Tour de Romandie and placing second in the Liège–Bastogne–Liège and the Critérium International. Cycling expert and author Bill McGann thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> would be disputed between Visentini and Gianbattista Baronchelli.|$|E

5|$|After {{being unable}} to win the {{previous}} running of the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, Dumas said that Porsche had to be focused, remain calm, and ensure that the team did not make any mistakes. Brendon Hartley, driving the No. 1 Porsche vehicle, said he {{was looking forward to}} racing the circuit because it is one of his favourite tracks and he felt {{it would be a good}} race for him and his team-mates. He also felt that his defence of the World Drivers' Championship would be revived at the track following his disqualification from the Silverstone event. Toyota No. 5 car driver Anthony Davidson said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> would give them an indication of the segments that needed focus on before heading to Le Mans and was looking forward to competing at Spa-Francorchamps.

5|$|As {{the returns}} were tallied on {{election}} day, {{it was clear}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>race</b> was close: Democrats had carried most of the South, as well as New York, Indiana, Connecticut, and New Jersey. In the Northeast, {{an increasing number of}} immigrants and their descendants voted Democratic. The official popular vote also favored Tilden (there was some Southern suppression of Republican votes), but Republicans realized that if they held the three unredeemed southern states together with some of the western states, they would emerge with an electoral college majority.|$|E

50|$|Between 1958 and 1961 three motor racing events {{took place}} at Middle Ridge, to {{coincide}} with the 'Carnival of the Flowers' in September. A rectangular circuit using Stenner Street-Mackenzie Street-Alderley Street-Rowbotham Street was run in an anti-clockwise direction. There have been several reasons given why racing stopped after 1961 - local farmers claimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>races</b> stopped their chickens laying eggs; the carnival organisers believed that loud racing engines were incompatible with flowers; or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>races</b> were pulling spectators away from other Carnival events.|$|R

40|$|It is {{my belief}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> failure of Brown v.

Consequently, integration has remained a concept instead of an action item. Implicit in this notion of desegregation is <b>the</b> idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>races</b> sit next to one another, while the concept of integration carries with it a much heavier burden. It appears <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>races</b> have never made a personal investment in each other and thereby have fallen short of meeting <b>the</b> high standard <b>that</b> true integration demands...|$|R
