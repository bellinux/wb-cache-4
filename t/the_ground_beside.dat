5|$|Nancy Lea {{died of an}} undiagnosed set of flu-like ailments on February 7, 1864, and was entombed on {{the grounds}} of her home. Margaret died on December 3, 1867, having {{contracted}} yellow fever during an epidemic. Walter Reed would not make his discovery of the cause of yellow fever through mosquito bite until 1900; contamination through contact was the pervading fear in 1867, and prevented Margaret's remains from being interred in a public cemetery with her husband's. She was buried in <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>beside</b> Nancy's tomb at 11 p.m. by her servant Bingley, family friend Major Eber Cave, and her two daughters Nettie and Mary Willie. No funeral service was performed.|$|E
25|$|In cool climates (such as in {{the high}} Arctic or at high elevations), the depth of a scrape nest can be {{critical}} to both the survival of developing eggs and the fitness of the parent bird incubating them. The scrape must be deep enough that eggs are protected from the convective cooling caused by cold winds, but shallow enough that they and the parent bird are not too exposed to the cooling influences of ground temperatures, particularly where the permafrost layer rises to mere centimeters below the nest. Studies have shown that an egg within a scrape nest loses heat 9% more slowly than an egg placed on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>beside</b> the nest; in such a nest lined with natural vegetation, heat loss is reduced by an additional 25%. The insulating factor of nest lining is apparently so critical to egg survival that some species, including Kentish plovers, will restore experimentally altered levels of insulation to their pre-adjustment levels (adding or subtracting material as necessary) within 24 hours.|$|E
25|$|A month later, Forrest {{was back}} in action at the Battle of Shiloh (April 6–7, 1862). He {{commanded}} a Confederate rear guard after the Union victory. In the battle of Fallen Timbers, he drove through the Union skirmish line. Not realizing {{that the rest of}} his men had halted their charge when reaching the full Union brigade, Forrest charged the brigade single-handedly, and soon found himself surrounded. He emptied his Colt Army revolvers into the swirling mass of Union soldiers and pulled out his saber, hacking and slashing. A Union infantryman on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>beside</b> him fired a musket ball into Forrest's spine with a point-blank musket shot, nearly knocking him out of the saddle. The ball went through his pelvis and lodged near his spine. Steadying himself and his mount, he used one arm to lift the Union soldier by the shirt collar and then wielded him as a human shield before casting his body aside after he had found his way to safety. Forrest is acknowledged to have been the last man wounded at the Battle of Shiloh. Forrest galloped back to his incredulous troopers. A surgeon removed the musket ball a week later, without anesthesia, which was unavailable. Forrest would likely have been given a generous dose of alcohol to muffle the pain of the surgery.|$|E

Having {{encouraged}} his pregnant lover, Ann Gill, to rob and leave her mistress, he murders the girl when she meets him.

500|$|On 20 March 1917, McNamara, {{flying a}} Martinsyde, {{was one of}} four No.1 Squadron pilots taking part in a raid against a Turkish railway {{junction}} near Gaza. Owing to a shortage of bombs, the aircraft were each armed with six specially modified 4.5-inch howitzer shells. McNamara had successfully dropped three of his shells when the fourth exploded prematurely, badly wounded him in the leg with shrapnel, an effect he likened to being [...] "hit with a sledgehammer". Having turned to head back to base, he spotted a fellow squadron member from the same mission, Captain David Rutherford, on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>beside</b> his crashlanded B.E.2. Allied airmen had been hacked to death by enemy troops in similar situations, and McNamara saw that a company of Turkish cavalry was fast approaching Rutherford's position. Despite the rough terrain and the gash in his leg, McNamara landed near Rutherford in an attempt to rescue him.|$|E
2500|$|Dvorak is {{also known}} as the first pole vaulter to use a bamboo pole in lieu of the traditional, heavier ash or hickory poles. [...] He first used a bamboo pole at the 1900 Summer Olympics. The hickory pole he had brought with him from Ann Arbor broke on a {{practice}} vault. One observer recalled, [...] "we heard a ripping, tearing noise, and looking around saw him lying on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>beside</b> his pole, which was broken and useless." [...] In spite of the [...] "severe jarring" [...] received in the fall, Dvorak borrowed a light bamboo pole from a Danish competitor and used it to complete his participation in the consolation event. [...] Dvorak's coach, Keene Fitzpatrick, opined that Dvorak {{would have been able to}} reach a height close to 12 feet if he had not been forced to jump with a new, unfamiliar pole. [...] Dvorak worked with a bamboo pole for approximately a year from 1902 to 1903, though he discarded the bamboo pole for his old pole when he broke the world's record in May 1903.|$|E

2500|$|A giant called Gwendol Wrekin ap Shenkin ap Mynyddmawr with {{a grudge}} against {{the town of}} Shrewsbury decided to flood the town and kill all its inhabitants. So he {{collected}} a giant-sized spadeful of earth and set off towards the town. When {{in the vicinity of}} Wellington he met a cobbler returning from Shrewsbury market with a large sackful of shoes for repair. The giant asked him for directions, adding {{that he was going to}} dump his spadeful of earth in the River Severn and flood the town. [...] "It's a very long way to Shrewsbury," [...] replied the quick-thinking shoemaker. [...] "Look at all these shoes I've worn out walking back from there!" [...] The giant immediately decided to abandon his enterprise and dumped the earth on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>beside</b> him, where it became the Wrekin. The giant also scraped the mud off his boots, which became the smaller hill Ercall Hill nearby.
