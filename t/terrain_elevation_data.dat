40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a set of guidelines on the use and integration of digital terrain data for Emergency Risk Management (ERM) planning, specifically in relation to flood hazard. The guidelines were developed by a node of the Cooperative Research Centre for Spatial Information (CRC-SI) at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), Sydney, Australia, in conjunction with NSW Government Agencies. The guidelines focus on the applied use of data acquired by Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) for digital elevation modelling and flood risk assessment at catchment to regional scales. Operational procedures for data capture and ground survey are outlined. Standardised techniques for generation of digital <b>terrain</b> and <b>elevation</b> <b>data,</b> accuracy assessment and feature extraction are demonstrated. The integration of geospatial data for flood risk and hazard assessment is discussed. The guidelines were designed to assist Local and State Government Agencies in undertaking future GIS based flood studies. The completed guidelines are available through the CRC-S...|$|R
40|$|Although new {{surveillance}} means {{have been}} deployed in Portugal {{in the last few}} years, such as automatic detection camera systems, the National Lookout Towers Network (NLTN) is still the main organized fire detection system, having a total of 236 observation posts. These posts have been placed gradually over the last decades, resulting in a under optimized network. To evaluate the NLTN covering effectiveness we have developed several automatic computer positioning algorithms, capable of objectively evaluating a surveillance configuration and calculate optimal changes. These algorithms run in MATLAB environment, are based on <b>terrain</b> <b>elevation</b> model <b>data</b> and use the cartography created by Rego and Catry to evaluate the covered area (Rego and others, 2005). The developed algorithms were first used to create a value ranking of all the surveillance posts {{in the context of the}} current NLTN, in order to determine which should be removed. We concluded that removing 20 posts (8. 5 percent), the covered area would only be reduced by 0. 4 percent. Next, the algorithms were used to automatically search the elevation model and create...|$|R

Airborne LIDAR uses a precise laser scanning technology that provides highly accurate <b>terrain</b> and conductor <b>elevation</b> <b>data</b> for the transmission line corridor. Algorithms aimed primarily at the extraction of necessary information for re-rating projects were implemented using ArcObjects, C # language, and ArcGIS Spatial Analyst, and 3 D Analyst extensions.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a GIS-based multi-class index overlay model to determine areas susceptible to inland flooding during extreme precipitation events in Broward County, Florida. Data layers used in the method include Airborne Laser <b>Terrain</b> Mapper (ALTM) <b>elevation</b> <b>data,</b> excess precipitation depth determined through performing a Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Curve Number (CN) analysis, and the slope of the terrain.

Results are displayed in maps of Eastern Broward County depicting types of flooding scenarios for a 100 -year, 24 -hour storm based on the soil saturation conditions.

40|$|Flood {{studies have}} been {{undertaken}} for many areas of coastal NSW, and with varying level of input from remotely sensed sources. As demonstrated in numerous studies, surface elevation can be estimated and above ground features extracted using data acquired by Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). Depending on {{the purpose of the}} flood study, the input data requirements and accuracy of the derived digital terrain data are variable. Through the integration of spatial information about the floodplain environment, different flood and storm surge scenarios, including those induced by climate change, can be simulated. Translated into digital flood intelligence, this data is useful to land managers, local councils and state emergency services for urban and coastal planning, disaster mitigation and emergency response. Currently, there is no consistent approach to the use of digital terrain data in the context of Emergency Risk Management (ERM) planning. This would form an important component of a State-wide or National Flood Policy. The University of New South Wales node of the CRC for Spatial Information (UNSW CRC-SI) in conjunction with NSW Government agencies have developed a set of guidelines for the GIS component of flood studies. The guidelines outline operational procedures for ALS and InSAR data capture, ground survey, standardised techniques for generation of digital <b>terrain</b> and <b>elevation</b> <b>data,</b> integration of geospatial data, feature extraction and accuracy assessment.

40|$|A {{case study}} of the Eskilstuna River in Sweden is presented. This study is carried out within the project KRIS-GIS®, a Swedish {{initiative}} of handling crisis situations, including flooding. The purpose is to show how different resolutions in input <b>elevation</b> <b>data</b> affect the resulting inundation maps. <b>Terrain</b> <b>elevation</b> points {{at the sides of}} the river were gathered from an airborne laser altimetry survey, and river bed elevations were gathered from an echosounding survey. The terrain model was constructed in ArcView GIS as a triangulated irregular network (TIN), which served as the base for all later modeling. The hydraulic modeling was done as one-dimensional steady flow in HEC-RAS flow routing software. High-resolution <b>elevation</b> <b>data</b> resulted in better inundation delineation than did lowresolution <b>elevation</b> <b>data.</b> If the mean water discharge was used in the modeling and if the river is narrow, a low resolution could even lead to that the river itself would not be marked as inundated. At high water discharges, the river was usually inundated, but there was great uncertainty if the riparian areas really would be flooded or not. With steep side slopes, the delineation of inundation becomes more certain, while at gentler side slopes, the flow is distributed on a larger surface with a risk that the raster cells will be incorrectly marked regarding inundation. Finally, the use of high-resolution <b>elevation</b> <b>data</b> compared with lowresolution data, makes estimates of friction factor, Manning’s n, relatively more important for correct results in inundation studies...|$|R

40|$|Current network {{simulators}} abstract out wireless propagation models due to {{the high}} computation requirements for realistic modeling. As such, {{there is still a}} large gap between the results obtained from simulators and real world scenario. In this paper, we present a framework for improved path loss simulation built on top of an existing network simulation software, NS- 3. Different from the conventional disk model, the proposed simulation also considers the diffraction loss computed using Epstein and Peterson’s model through the use of actual <b>terrain</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>data</b> to give an accurate estimate of path loss between a transmitter and a receiver. The drawback of high computation requirements is relaxed by offloading the computationally intensive components onto an inexpensive off-the-shelf parallel coprocessor, which is a NVIDIA GPU. Experiments are performed using actual <b>terrain</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>data</b> provided from United States Geological Survey. As compared to the conventional CPU architecture, the experimental result shows that a speedup of 20 x to 42 x is achieved by exploiting the parallel processing of GPU to compute the path loss between two nodes using <b>terrain</b> <b>elevation</b> <b>data.</b> The result shows that the path losses between two nodes are greatly affected by the terrain profile between these two nodes. Besides this, the result also suggests that the common strategy to place the transmitter in the highest position may not always work...|$|E

A 19, 200 m² plot was marked with a 20 x 20 m spacing grid. Crop yield and soil attributes, at 0 - 0. 2 m deep layer, were measured in 63 points in 1985, 1987 and 1988. The spatial variability was assessed by semivariogram calculation using geostatistics. Soil base saturation index (BS) was interpolated by kriging and also, using a bivariate geostatistical method, the collocated cokriging (CLCK) using <b>terrain</b> <b>elevation</b> as ancillary <b>data.</b> Although, the coefficient of variation (Cv) for soil organic matter content decreased from 1985 (20. 4 %) to 1988 (10. 7 %), its mean value increased 32 % in the same period. The soil fertility in 1985 was found to be more diverse (i. e. high Cv value), providing evidences that the clearing and subsequent no tillage cultivation increased soil homogeneity. Experimental semivariograms were best fitted to a spherical model. The cultivation under NTS improved the spatial continuity of the studied attributes at close distances.
