50|$|The GS1000 and GS1100 {{shaft drive}} models had 8-valve engines while later GS1000S (Katana) and all GS1100 chain drive models had 16 valve engines. Suzuki {{utilized}} the 1980s GS1100G blueprint {{to design the}} 1991 GSX1100G, combining a shaft-drive chassis with a modified GSX-R1100 engine that had 16 valves breathing through Mikuni 'slingshot' carburetors (which have a <b>throttle</b> <b>slide</b> that is flat {{on one side and}} rounded on the other to generate less intake turbulence).|$|E
5000|$|The 2.0 L (1990 cc, 121 in3) M31 used a KKK {{turbocharger}} and Kugelfischer P04 mechanical {{fuel injection}} with a <b>sliding</b> <b>throttle</b> plate. It has a compression ratio of 6.9:1 and produces [...]|$|R
50|$|The 109-558 {{was capable}} of {{propelling}} an Hs 117 at 900 - 1000 km/h, with <b>throttle</b> control by <b>sliding</b> valves in the exhaust nozzle, operated by a servomotor controlled by a Mach sensor. Production of the 109-558 took forty to sixty hours using a very high proportion of slave labour.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we discuss the {{suitability}} of various equipment types used to capture the user’s subjective perceptual quality evaluation for video streams with time-variant quality. We present four basic types of testing equipment (mouse, joystick, <b>throttle</b> and <b>sliding</b> bar). Since method and equipment used for testing must not influence the test results, we analyzed the requirements for the testing equipment in general and in particular its usability and design features. Furthermore, we performed and evaluated an assessment of video quality using all presented tools. The evaluation allows us to propose the most appropriate testing tool for time-variant video quality.

50|$|Qualifying {{resulted}} in pole position for Vittorio Brambilla in his March, while Lauda qualified fifth fastest and his teammate Clay Regazzoni 11th. In the race Brambilla took the lead, but by lap 16 he was overtaken by Carlos Reutemann's Brabham and eventually had to retire with a blistered front tyre. Tom Pryce had to pit early due to <b>throttle</b> <b>slides</b> being clogged by sand, whilst Patrick Depailler suffered a brake line leak. Hunt retired on lap 22 with a brake-pipe leak, promoting Regazzoni and Mario Andretti. Poor Jean-Pierre Jarier lost second place to failing oil pressure on lap 38. Young Tony Brise was showing little {{respect for his}} elders, overtaking Mark Donohue and Ronnie Peterson and then challenging championship leader Emerson Fittipaldi. The battle which ensued slowed them up and John Watson in the Surtees had soon climbed up behind them. Meanwhile, Lauda was steadily progressing through the field and on lap 42 he was second. He put a series of fastest laps, benefiting from a harder tyre compound, closed on Reutemann and overtook him to win the Grand Prix by 6 seconds. Reutemann finished second with Regazzoni, in the other Ferrari 312T, third. Brise had his gearbox jammed in fourth and surrendered to Donohue, but on his third Grand Prix gained his first World Championship point and Graham Hill's first as a constructor. It would prove the only point of Brise's promising but brief F1 career. Fittipaldi suffered braking problems and was passed by Jody Scheckter at the race end to finish in eighth.|$|R
50|$|Adhesion of {{the driving}} wheels to the rails was {{obtained}} {{by means of a}} cylinder and piston secured to the sliding boxes. The engineer was on an elevated platform in the front part of the engine, the fireman being at the rear end. The former had an unobstructed view through the windows of the monitor roof, and before him were five hydraulic cocks, which control the <b>throttle,</b> links, <b>sliding</b> boxes {{of the driving}} wheels, the brake, and the coupling rods of the entire train, while just above were steam and hydraulic pressure gauges and indicators, whistle and bell ropes, etc. With an engine thus furnished with provisions for gripping the rails, steep grades became of minor importance, as the steepest possible could be ascended if the requisite power was provided.|$|R
5000|$|The 2002 Turbo was {{launched}} at the 1973 Frankfurt Motor Show. This was BMW's first turbocharged production {{car and the}} first turbocharged car since General Motors' brief offerings in the early 1960s. It produced [...] at 5,800 rpm, with 240 Nm of torque. The 2002 Turbo used the 2002 tii engine with a KKK turbocharger and a compression ratio of 6.9:1 {{in order to prevent}} engine knocking. Kugelfischer mechanical fuel injection was used, with a <b>sliding</b> <b>throttle</b> plate instead of the usual throttle butterfly. The 2002 Turbo was introduced just before the 1973 oil crisis, therefore only 1,672 were built.|$|R
50|$|There {{are other}} ways of {{controlling}} fuel flow for example with the dash-pot throttle lever. The throttle has a gear which meshes with the control valve (like a rack and pinion) causing it to slide along a cylinder which has ports at various positions. Moving the <b>throttle</b> and hence <b>sliding</b> the valve along the cylinder, opens and closes these ports as designed. There are actually 2 valves viz. the throttle and the control valve. The control valve is used to control pressure {{on one side of}} the throttle valve such that it gives the right opposition to the throttle control pressure. It does this by controlling the fuel outlet from within the cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|For 1963, Coventry Climax {{was able}} to {{convince}} Lucas to supply the cogged belt driven fuel injection system originally developed for BRM with then-unique <b>sliding</b> <b>throttle</b> plates with four round intake bores cut out. With the larger bore (from 63 mm to 68 mm) and shorter stroke (60 mm to 51.5 mm) compared to Mk.II, notable changes include the increase in conrod length (from 4.2" [...] to 5.1" [...] center to center, with a shorter piston crown height) and the switch from crossplane to flatplane crankshaft, which surprisingly did not increase vibration in the higher RPM range because the longer conrod length counteracted the increase in secondary vibration inherent in flatplane design.|$|R
5000|$|While it {{retained}} the [...] "Bubble Window" [...] styling, it {{differed from the}} Italian model in that its headlamps were fixed separately {{to the sides of}} the bodywork and it carried the BMW badge below the windscreen. The car was also redesigned to take {{a modified version of the}} 250 cc four-stroke engine from the BMW R25/3 motorcycle and the front suspension was changed. The single-cylinder generated [...] at 5800 rpm. The crankcase and cylinder were made of cast iron, the cylinder head of aluminium. However, the head was rotated by 180° compared with the motorcycle engine. The twin-bearing crankshaft was also different in the Isetta power unit, being larger and featuring reinforced bearings. One of the reasons for this was the heavy Dynastart unit which combined the dynamo and self-starter. The fuel mixture was provided by a Bing <b>sliding</b> <b>throttle</b> side draft motorcycle carburetor. In addition to further changes of detail, the BMW engineers enlarged the sump for installation in the car and cooled the engine by means of a radial fan and shrouded ducting.|$|R
