40|$|Daily data on {{spot and}} forward dollar/sterling {{exchange}} rates and on Britain's {{foreign exchange reserves}} are used to reassess the financial history of the 1956 Suez crisis. We find that support of sterling at its Bretton Woods lower bound lost credibility as early as July. Reserve losses also are consistent with an exchange rate crisis. We provide the first econometric study of foreign exchange market intervention in the pre-convertibility phase of the Bretton Woods system. The Bank of England's interventions reacted strongly both to official sterling and to the <b>transferable</b> <b>sterling</b> market in New York, which suggests that convertibility was a central goal of policy.

5000|$|Eurotreasury WarrantsQuadrex Holdings first subsidiary, Quadrex Securities Ltd. {{specialized}} in international financial transactions. [...] Its first deal as lead manager {{was an issue}} for the U.S conglomerate Transamerica of [...] "Eurotreasury" [...] warrants. This {{was an attempt to}} create a vehicle for trading in Europe what would have been in effect options on long-term US Treasury Bonds. In spite of the issue being heavily advertised on the day, the offer was cancelled several hours later as demand proved insufficient. However, two days later, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Salomon Brothers Inc. unit of Philbro-Salmon duplicated the Transamerica Treasury warrant offering in almost every aspect except the price. After duplicating Klesch’s idea, Hansgeorg Hofmann, executive director of Merrill Lynch International said [...] "He (Klesch) was the first who had the guts to try it but in circumstances that made it difficult to succeed. In 1987, Klesch was recognized as the acknowledged developer of [...] "EuroTreasury" [...] Warrants with the Institutional Investor award for best idea. Following on from its first deal, Quadrex Securities Ltd. managed a series of other deals in 1984, including the $50 million 10 year issue for Equitable Bancorp and its first international deal, Citicorp’s $100 million offering of two year extendable bonds. By early 1985, Klesch had begun to look beyond Eurobond trading and started to undertake a series of acquisitions for his investment group including the first leveraged buyout of a public company in the United Kingdom, the tender offer for R P Martin PLC, one of the largest foreign exchange brokers in the world. Also in 1985, Quadrex Securities Ltd., announced the offering of the first Euro-sterling zero coupon obligations backed by United Kingdom government securities, a new financial instrument to the securities market. The securities, known as STAGS (<b>Sterling</b> <b>Transferable</b> Accruing Government Securities), were issued in the Euro-sterling sector of the Eurobond market. However, the technique which had proved successful in the United States failed to attract enough attention and was withdrawn shortly after they were launched. After this, Klesch bought Polymer Corp, a maker of plastic parts, in 1986, and BoreSteel, a steel company in 1987 in an attempt to diversify Quadrex away from finance. He also drew up a plan for a consortium bid to break up Pearson PLC, the conglomerate that owned the Financial Times, although theoretically sound the plan was leaked to the media and appeared superficial and therefore ultimately failed. By 1990 Quadrex Holdings had been wound down and was officially dissolved in 1999. It was a victim of the decline in the bond market and had also become entangled in a lawsuit with British & Commonwealth Holdings PLC over the acquisition of the money broking side of financial service group, Mercantile House.|$|R
