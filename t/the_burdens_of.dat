5|$|Chappell had {{a direct}} {{influence}} on Hughes' successor, Allan Border. Early in his captaincy tenure, Border was struggling with <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> the position so the ACB appointed Bob Simpson as team coach to assist. This led to animosity between Chappell and Simpson as Chappell derided {{the need for a}} coach. Simpson responded by writing that the peer influence of older players helping younger players fell away during the era when the Chappell brothers led the team, and he was redressing the problem.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze, how rules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof and rules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> argumentation justify a thesis, which is found as a true {{statement}} by court. Two concepts of the truth discussed in the Polish civil procedure (the objective/material truth and the judicial truth) are compared in connection with <b>the</b> rules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof and <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> argumentation. <b>The</b> rules <b>of</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof and <b>the</b> rules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> argumentation are constitutive rules. They state under what conditions a thesis counts as justified. The justification of a decision of applying law based on <b>the</b> rules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof or rules <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> argumentation is institutional, not substantial...|$|R

5|$|Expanding on {{the dense}} {{production}} style of West's 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Watch the Throne incorporates orchestral and progressive rock influences, unconventional samples, and dramatic melodies in its sound. Jay-Z and West's braggadocio lyrics exhibit themes of opulence, fame, materialism, power, and <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> success, {{as well as}} political and socioeconomic context. The album expresses other topics such as Jay-Z's thoughts on fatherhood, West's reflection on being deemed a social villain, and their success as performers. Music writers interpreted the subject matter to concern the rappers' plight as African Americans struggling with financial success in America.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{worked with}} Republicans {{to shift the}} source of federal funds from taxes to tariffs. He {{believed}} the taxation of alcohol spread <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> taxation unfairly, especially as concerned his constituents, who included several distillers. He also believed the income tax, first enacted during the Civil War, was being administered unfairly, with large refunds often accruing to powerful business interests. On this point, Randall was successful, and the House accepted an amendment that required all cases for refunds over $500 to be tried before a federal district court. He also worked toward the elimination of taxation on tea, coffee, cigars, and matches, all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor. Relief from taxation made these items cheaper for the average American, while increasing reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall's district, as it made foreign products more expensive.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{problems}} pertaining to <b>the</b> allocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof in mixed disputes in legal and non-legal contexts are addressed. First the traditional view on <b>the</b> allocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof based on Whately’s legal conception of ‘presumption’ is discussed. Whately’s proposal is not adequate for {{the solution of}} problems related to <b>the</b> allocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof in everyday mixed disputes {{where there is no}} presumption of status quo. Using the pragma-dialectical perspective it is explained how practical questions regarding <b>the</b> division <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof are solved in a legal context. It is shown that for argumentation theory, the combination of material and procedural rules for <b>the</b> allocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof offer an instrument for <b>the</b> allocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof in both legal and non-legal discussions...|$|R

5|$|Serving as Secretary of the Treasury in the {{administration}} of Rutherford B. Hayes, Sherman continued his efforts for financial stability and solvency, overseeing an end to wartime inflationary measures and a return to gold-backed money. He returned to the Senate after his term expired, serving there for a further sixteen years. During that time he continued his work on financial legislation, as well as writing and debating laws on immigration, business competition law, and the regulation of interstate commerce. Sherman was the principal author of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which was signed into law by President Benjamin Harrison. In 1897, President William McKinley appointed him Secretary of State. Failing health and declining faculties made him unable to handle <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> the job, and he retired in 1898 {{at the start of the}} Spanish–American War. Sherman died at his home in Washington, D.C. in 1900.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Empire {{reached its}} {{greatest}} territorial extent {{during the second}} century AD; the following two centuries witnessed the slow decline of Roman control over its outlying territories. Economic issues, including inflation, and external pressure on the frontiers combined to create the Crisis of the Third Century, with emperors coming to the throne only to be rapidly replaced by new usurpers. Military expenses increased steadily during the third century, mainly {{in response to the}} war with the Sasanian Empire, which revived {{in the middle of the}} third century. The army doubled in size, and cavalry and smaller units replaced the Roman legion as the main tactical unit. The need for revenue led to increased taxes and a decline in numbers of the curial, or landowning, class, and decreasing numbers of them willing to shoulder <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> holding office in their native towns. More bureaucrats were needed in the central administration to deal with the needs of the army, which led to complaints from civilians that there were more tax-collectors in the empire than tax-payers.|$|E
5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized <b>the</b> <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof (...) is <b>the</b> duty of a {{party in}} a trial to produce the {{evidence}} that will prove the claims they have made against the other party. In a legal dispute, one party is initially presumed to be correct and gets {{the benefit of the}} doubt, while the other side bears <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof. When a party bearing <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof meets their <b>burden,</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof switches to <b>the</b> other side. <b>Burdens</b> may be <b>of</b> different kinds for each party, in different phases <b>of</b> litigation. <b>The</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> production is a minimal burden to produce at least enough evidence for the trier of fact to consider a disputed claim. After litigants have met <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> production and their claim is being considered by a trier of fact, they have <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> persuasion, that enough evidence has been presented to persuade the trier of fact that their side is correct. There are different standards of persuasiveness ranging from a preponderance of the evidence, where there is just enough evidence to tip the balance, to proof beyond a reasonable doubt, as in United States criminal courts.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> {{proof is}} <b>the</b> {{obligation}} {{of a party}} in an argument or dispute to provide sufficient evidence to shift the other party's or a third party's belief from their initial position. <b>The</b> <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof must be fulfilled by both establishing confirming evidence and negating oppositional evidence.
