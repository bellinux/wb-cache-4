25|$|Subjectivity {{comes with}} {{consciousness}} {{of myself as}} a self. It encompasses the emotional and intellectual resources that the individual is born with. Subjectivity is what the individual is as a human being. Now the problem of subjectivity is to decide how to choose—what rules or models is the individual going to use to make <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>choices?</b> What are <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>choices?</b> Who defines right? To be truly an individual, to be true to himself, his actions should in some way be expressed so that they describe who and what he is to himself and to others. The problem, according to Kierkegaard, is that we must choose who and what we will be based on subjective interests—the individual must make choices that will mean something to him as a reasoning, feeling being.|$|E
25|$|Buddy warns Phyllis that Sally {{is still}} in love with Ben, and she is shaken by how the past threatens to repeat itself. Sally is awed by Ben’s {{apparently}} glamorous life, but Ben wonders if he made <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>choices</b> and considers how things might have been ("The Road You Didn't Take"). Sally tells Ben how her days have been spent with Buddy, trying to convince him (and herself) ("In Buddy’s Eyes"). But it is clear that Sally {{is still in}} love with Ben – even though their affair ended badly when Ben decided to marry Phyllis. She shakes loose from the memory and begins to dance with Ben, who is touched by the memory of the Sally he once cast aside.|$|E

Four different emotions can show up in testimony analyses – happiness, anger, shock, and sadness (the icon of which also represents fear) – which will light up with different intensity. The player goes through the testimony, and aims to determine the cause of the conflicting emotion.

500|$|Tom Welling {{feels that}} the deal Jonathan made with Jor-El at the {{beginning}} of season three made Jonathan realize that he will not always be around to protect Clark. Welling believes that it is the repercussions of that deal that allow Jonathan to give Clark more freedom in the choices that he makes during season three. Jonathan realizes that he must help Clark find the confidence in his ability to survive on his own, so that he can leave home one day. One scene that Schneider specifically remembers {{was at the end of}} season three's [...] "Forsaken". Here, Jonathan admits to not trusting his own instincts anymore and allowing Clark to rely on his. This [...] "admission of fallibility", but faith in his son's ability to make <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>choices,</b> is what Schneider sees as the growing of the family dynamic.|$|E
500|$|In the 2010 film Blood Done Sign My Name, {{which was}} {{based on a true story}} of small town racial turmoil set in a {{backdrop}} of belated segregation in 1970, Parker plays a 22-year-old Benjamin Chavis. Parker's Chavis was a teacher who had been born into an affluent African-American family and would later become the Executive Director of the N.A.A.C.P. A. O. Scott of The New York Times described Parker as [...] "diffident" [...] and his portrayal as [...] "thoughtful, morally serious". Steven Rea of the Philadelphia Inquirer notes that events in the film move Parker with both [...] "resolve and rage": Roger Ebert described Parker's Chavis as [...] "energized and angered" [...] in one of the two main storylines of the film that started with Chavis leading an economic boycott after an adverse court verdict. Parker's character was [...] "peripheral" [...] according to The New York Post Kyle Smith and upstaged according to Scott and Ebert. However, Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune noted that Parker's portrayal infused dimension into Chavis, whose cousin's death was the subject of the film. Phillips noted that the role showed that with <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>choices</b> Parker had the potential to be a big star in the future.|$|E

500|$|However, as is {{most often}} the case with film adaptations, {{differences}} do exist between the film and source material. Certain scenes from the book were cut from the film, such as a biology room scene where Bella's class does blood typing. Hardwicke explains, [...] "Well [...] almost 500 pages—you do have to do the sweetened condensed milk version of that.... We already have two scenes in biology: the first time they're in there and then the second time when they connect. For a film, when you condense, you don't want to keep going back to the same setting over and over. So that's not in there." [...] The settings of certain conversations in the book were also changed to make the scenes more [...] "visually dynamic" [...] on-screen, such as Bella's revelation that she knows Edward is a vampire—this happens in a meadow in the film instead of in Edward's car as in the novel. A biology field trip scene is added to the film to condense the moments of Bella's frustration at trying to explain how Edward saved her from being crushed by a van. The villainous vampires are introduced earlier in the film than in the novel. Rosenberg said that [...] "you don't really see James and the other villains until to {{the last quarter of the}} book, which really won't work for a movie. You need that ominous tension right off the bat. We needed to see them and that impending danger from the start. And so I had to create back story for them, what they were up to, to flesh them out a bit as characters." [...] Rosenberg also combined some of the human high school students, with Lauren Mallory and Jessica Stanley in the novel becoming the character of Jessica in the film, and a [...] "compilation of a couple of different human characters" [...] becoming Eric Yorkie. About these variances from the book, Mooradian stated, [...] "I think we did a really judicious job of distilling [...] Our greatest critic, Stephenie Meyer, loves the screenplay, and that tells me that we made all <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>choices</b> in terms of what to keep and what to lose. Invariably, you're going to lose bits and pieces that certain members of the audience are going to desperately want to see, but there's just a reality that we're not making 'Twilight: The Book' the movie." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: I {{argue that}} <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>choice</b> of subject pool is intimately {{linked to the}} {{research}} question. At least within economics, students are often the perfect subject pool for answering some fundamental research questions. Student subject pools can provide an invaluable benchmark for investigating generalizability across different social groups or cultures. 2 In their excellent article, Henrich et al. (forthcoming) rightly caution us to be careful when we draw general conclusions from WEIRD subject pools of which undergraduates are {{the most frequently used}} one, also in economics. My main comment is that <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>choice</b> of subject pool is intimately linked to the research question. Since the different behavioral sciences also have different research questions, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>choice</b> of subject pool will also often be different across disciplines. In my own discipline, economics, students are actually often the best subject pool for quite a few (fundamental) research questions. Here is why I believe so. Economic theories normally do not come with assumptions (or even caveats) about the restricted validity to only a specific group of people, that is, they (implicitly) assum...|$|R
