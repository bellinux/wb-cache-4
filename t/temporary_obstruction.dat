40|$|Abstract—We {{report on}} the {{development}} of a TDMA based wireless sensor system for temperature monitoring. The transponders consisting of passive surface acoustic wave delay line sensors were designed for operation in the ISM band at 2. 45 GHz and for a temperature range from- 20 °C to 180 °C. A multi-step evaluation scheme is introduced using a combination of delay and phase analysis. The presented design of these sensors is based on relating the sensor’s effective SNR to the resulting accuracy concerning a delay or phase evaluation. These proposed design rules present a basis for the design of wireless delay line sensors in general, the optimum choice of a pure phase or a combined time delay and phase evaluation scheme, and due to the estimation of phase ambiguity regions, an exact design of multi-step evaluation schemes and their transition. At the same time the SNR relation is of practical value for wireless monitoring systems employed in environments suffering short-term elevated noise levels or <b>temporary</b> <b>obstructions,</b> as the sensor accuracy and thus the error bounds for individual sensors can be determined for each measurement.

40|$|Two {{sorts of}} limbic system {{disorder}} {{have been found}} to combine in the causation of aggressive behavior. When recurrent hypoglycemia is added to temporal lobe EEC dysfunction, the result will probably include psychomotor disturbances which resemble temper tantrums.

It is proposed that one cause of this temporal lobe disorder is the anoxic damage which occurs during compression of the skull when labor is prolonged.

40|$|SUMMARY To {{demonstrate}} the BBB break-down on the CT {{image in the}} acute stage of cerebral infarction, a 3 hour continuous drip infusion of 200 ml of meglumine amidtrizoate, rather than the conventional bolus Injection, was used. In this study, 22 examinations were carried out in 18 patients in whom cerebral infarction due to <b>temporary</b> or permanent <b>obstruction</b> of the cerebral artery was diagnosed by CT and angiography on admission. With each examination, the first CT was obtained prior to contrast infusion, and second immediately {{after the end of}} 3 hours of continuous contrast infusion.

40|$|Kim Le, Hady Saheb Department of Ophthalmology, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada Abstract: Trabecular micro-bypass stents, {{commonly}} known as iStents, are micro-invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) devices used to treat open-angle glaucoma. Like other MIGS procedures that enhance trabecular outflow, the iStent lowers intraocular pressure (IOP) by creating a direct channel between the anterior chamber and Schlemm’s canal. iStents are typically implanted {{at the time of}} phacoemulsification for patients with open-angle glaucoma and visually significant cataracts. This review summarizes the published data regarding the efficacy, safety, and cost considerations of trabecular micro-bypass stents. Most studies found statistically significant reductions in mean IOP and ocular medication use after combined phacoemulsification with single or double iStent implantation. The devices were found to be very safe, with a safety profile similar to that of cataract surgery.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} time-dependent changes {{caused by}} temporal portal vein obstruction and subsequent reperfusion in the lobe {{with or without}} an occluded portal vein. METHODS: The portal vein (PV) of the anterior lobe of the liver of a male Wistar rat (8 wk-old) was obstructed (70 %) for 12, 24, 36 and 48 h, respectively, and models were sacrificed at 48 h after reperfusion (each group: n = 10). The histological changes {{and the status of}} liver regeneration were compared between a liver biopsy performed on each lobe after <b>temporary</b> <b>obstruction</b> of the portal vein in the same rat liver, and the liver extracted at the time of sacrifice (48 h after reperfusion). RESULTS: With regard to the obstructed lobe, the liver weight/body weight ratio significantly decreased according to obstruction time.

The duration of PV occlusion did not seem to be strong enough to introduce liver weight increase. Stimulation of liver regeneration was brought about in the non-occluded lobe by 12 -h occlusion, and was sustained even at 48 h after reperfusion. The obstructed lobe atrophied with the passage of time in the obstructed state. However, the proliferating-cell nuclear antigen labeling index also increased at 48 h after reperfusion, and a repair mechanism was observed.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of <b>temporary</b> <b>obstruction</b> (20 h), ascending Escherichia coli urinary infection leads to irreversible acute exudative pyelonephritis (AEP) in rats. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate the early inflammatory events which take place in response to {{the presence}} of bacteria in the kidney parenchyma and lead to the development of AEP. Rats were given indomethacin before and during the obstructive phase of kidney infection and were sacrificed at different times thereafter. Although renal infection (as defined by bacterial counts) was equally frequent (76 %) and severe in indomethacin-treated and control rats sacrificed at the end of the obstructive period, it was found that the incidence of AEP (as defined by the inflammatory response of the kidney elicited by bacteria) 2 days after removal of the obstruction was significantly reduced from 74 % in controls given water to 48 % in indomethacin-treated animals (P = 0. 02). Rat kidneys without AEP had bacterial counts of 10 (2) /g. Since indomethacin apparently had no direct antibacterial activity against E. coli and no effect on urine osmolalities, it is likely that the reduction in the incidence of AEP and the concomitant eradication of bacteria after removal of the obstruction was due to an effect of indomethacin that is related to the renal response to infection. This was possibly due to decreased inflammation, as indicated by the fact that when pyelonephritis developed in indomethacin-treated rats it was less severe than in controls. These results suggest that if inflammation can be mitigated when bacteria are present in the kidney during obstruction, the bacteria may be cleared spontaneously once the normal urinary flow is restored...|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{infection}} of the intubated and previously sterile biliary tract of the dog with particles of the stools leads to a formation of urobilin from the bilirubin of the bile as it flows through the ducts. No urobilinuria occurs, however, unless <b>temporary</b> biliary <b>obstruction</b> is produced, or the liver parenchyma injured. Then urobilinuria develops, {{despite the fact that}} no bile is reaching the intestine and, by corollary, no urobilin being formed there. Cholangitic urobilinuria, as one may term the phenomenon just described, to distinguish it from the urobilinuria having origin in pigment absorbed from within the intestine, is far more pronounced in animals possessing a healthy gall bladder than in those with a pathological gall bladder or with one prevented from functioning by severance of the cystic duct.

40|$|By {{a method}} of {{permanent}} intubation the entire output of bile from dogs has been obtained in a sterile state {{over long periods of}} time, and studied quantitatively. The secretion of the first few days after the initial operation is scanty, contains more pigment than that secreted later, and is sometimes so viscid as to cause <b>temporary</b> <b>obstruction</b> within the collecting tube. The small amount and thick consistency of the fluid are referable to direct injury of the liver and ducts, while the abundant bilirubin is derived, in part at least, from the hemoglobin of extravasated blood. In some animals in which there was accidental mercuric chloride poisoning at the time of operation a suppression of the bile followed which, in one instance, was complete during the 48 hours before death. In a dog developing mixed infection of the biliary tract, an almost colorless fluid, glairy as white of egg, gradually took the place of the bile. Not until a week or 10 days after operation does the bile acquire the character which it maintains later. The quantity of this later bile, as measured in successive 24 hour specimens, is greatly less than that recorded by previous investigators, a difference attributable to disturbing influences inevitable to the method of collection they employed. By our method, it averaged from 3. 5 to 9. 5 cc. per kilo of dog in 24 hours, though transient variations from 1 cc. up to 14 cc. were encountered. Some dogs give consistently far more bile than others. The frequently recorded effects of fasting to lessen the rate of secretion, and of a meat diet to increase it more than a carbohydrate one, were noted often. Contrary to expectation, vigorous exercise does not act to increase the quantity of the bile. During hot weather this may sink greatly, although the animal remains in good condition; and during intercurrent diseases unassociated with jaundice, the flow may almost cease. One of the best of cholagogues, bile by mouth, fails of effect under such circumstances. It acts best when the animal is healthy, the weather not oppressive, and the food intake abundant. The bilirubin output, after the immediate effects of the operation have worn off, remains nearly constant from day to day, though often exhibiting slow, wave-like variations, each extending over a week or more. These slow changes are synchronous with similar alterations in the hemoglobin percentage of the circulating blood. A recognition of them is important to studies of the bilirubin yield. A mild anemia, absent in controls maintained under like conditions, regularly develops in unexercised dogs completely deprived of bile, despite their apparent health, and as it does so the bilirubin output falls off. Prior {{to the development of the}} anemia the output averages about 7. 5 mg. per kilo in 24 hours, a yield which closely corresponds with that recorded by previous workers. Vigorous exercise of animals previously sedentary causes an increased pigment output presumably as result of increased blood destruction. Since the daily pigment output is approximately constant, whereas the fluid quantity undergoes frequent and great changes, it follows that the pigment concentration must vary inversely as the fluid quantity, and vary greatly. It does both. No matter how large or small the 24 hour specimen of bile may be within "normal" limits, therein will be found the customary quota of pigment. When, under pathological conditions, the bile flow almost ceases, the pigment concentration becomes extremely great. A similar reciprocal relationship between concentration and fluid quantity would seem to hold for the mucinous element of the bile. Scanty biles are ropy as a rule, and copious ones are watery. <b>Temporary</b> <b>obstruction</b> was produced by clamping the outlet tube from the common duct, and the bile yield following upon its relief was studied. Secretion was for a time far more copious than usual, with a low pigment content per cubic centimeter, and tended to remain so until the accumulated pigment had been voided. As much extra bilirubin is put forth after 24 hours of obstruction as if the liver continued to manufacture the pigment without interruption during it. Obstruction for this length of time appears to cause no subjective disturbance in most instances, though bilirubinuria develops. Even this sign of bile retention may be lacking when obstruction endures but 12 hours. The physiological and clinical significance of these facts is briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|Many factors {{make the}} {{management}} of city road networks more complex than {{the management of}} rural networks. As matter of fact in the former we have: many type of users, limited alternative routes to avoid <b>temporary</b> <b>obstruction</b> or road closure due to work zone, congestion issues, presence of guideway urban transit systems (e. g. tram and trolleybus), high sensibility towards the environmental issues (noise, vibration, air pollution etc.), town planning requirements, issues related to protection of monuments, etc. In Italy many city administration in order to optimize the road asset management and to improve performance and reduce costs, have ordered the management activity to external service provider by signing global service or concession agreement (see prEN 15221 - 1 06). In these organisation we have three actors: the administration (owner), the manager (service provider internal or external to administration) and the end users. It is responsibility of the administrations to specify the requirements of the management service, which should be aligned to the economic, organisational and strategic objectives defined in the transport policy of the Administration. The most common objectives in urban areas are: accessibility for all users (i. e. vehicles, pedestrian cycle, etc.), safety, environment, transport quality and mobility, asset development and improvement. Once demand requirements of Admistration are clearly expressed the management service can be formalized and ordered through a service level agreement (SLAs). Level of Service is defined through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which are used by Administration to ensure that the system move towards the pre-defined goals, and by manager to select maintenance projects, evaluating the impact of each project on level of service. Therefore Performance Indicator are essential element in road asset management activities, delivered by both internal or external provider, as matter of fact in the last decade most international organization and public agency made substantial effort in order to develop criteria for measuring performance. The most significant findings of previous studies suggest, among other things, that that the indicators should be related to stakeholder, structured in quality levels (IQL) and that a relationship should exist between the various stakeholder and the IQL. In the following a framework of indicators to be used in urban areas are illustrated, particularly fixing the attention on the description of the environmental performance indicators...|$|E
40|$|Acute {{pyelonephritis}} {{especially in}} childhood {{is a serious}} and globally common bacterial infection. The infecting microorganism is often derived from the patient's own bowel flora and mainly affects the renal parenchyma and pelvis. If left untreated, acute pyelonephritis can lead to renal scarring and renal failure with a need for dialysis and/or renal replacement therapy. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate the inflammatory processes involved in acute pyelonephritis and scarring using a murine model system. Thus mice were transurethrally inoculated with E. coli (CFT 073) or as control with saline. Inoculation was followed by <b>temporary</b> <b>obstruction</b> of the urethra. The mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory (IL- 1, IL- 6, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha and antiinflammatory (IL- 4, IL- 10, IL- 12, TGF-beta) cytokines were compared in infected and control mice. These studies showed that an early and sustained up regulation of pro-inflammatory and down- regulating cytokines was observed both locally in the kidneys and systemically in the spleen of infected mice as well as in saline inoculated and obstructed mice, indicating an influence of the obstruction per se. In order to evaluate the effect of an angiotensin 11 type 1 receptor antagonist, losartan, the same experimental model was used. Mice treated with losartan showed a marked reduction of TGF-beta mRNA expression and protein secretion compared to saline treated controls. A 50 % reduction in cortical scarring was also observed at 3 and 8 weeks compared to control mice, but this difference failed to attain statistical significance (P = 0. 07). The importance of IL- 6 in the inflammatory response and for bacterial clearance was further studied in a strain of IL- 6 deficient mice. Significantly lower TGF-beta mRNA and protein levels were found in the kidneys of IL- 6 deficient mice compared to their wild type counterparts with acute pyelonephritis. In vitro rIL- 6 significantly increased TGF-beta production from splenocytes in E. coli infected IL- 6 deficient mice. IL- 6 deficient mice displayed more severe histo-pathological indices and retained viable bacteria in their kidneys longer than their wild type counterparts. E. coli infection proved to be more lethal in IL- 6 deficient mice as well. High MIP- 2 (the mouse equivalent of human IL- 8), MCP- 1 and RANTES mRNA expression and protein production were found early after bacterial inoculation followed by a gradual decrease in kidney sections and homogenates of mice with acute experimental pyelonephritis. In IL- 10 deficient mice higher MIP- 2 production was found in the kidneys than in the wild type counterparts. Stimulation of a human renal epithelial cell line and human primary mesangial cells with the same bacterial antigen led to a rapid increase in IL- 8, MCP- 1 and RANTES gene expression. Likewise a rapid release of IL- 8 and MCP- 1 was observed in both cell types, while RANTES release was delayed. Conclusions: Acute experimental E. coli pyelonephritis and obstruction per se are both associated with a rapid up-regulation of pro-inflammatory and modulating cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression, both locally and systemically. The angiotensin II type I receptor antagonist, losartan, attenuated TGF-beta and reduced cortical scarring. IL- 6 upregulate TGF-beta and is important for bacterial clearance from infected kidneys and also for host survival...|$|E
40|$|Adult rabbits were inoculated orally (or duodenally) with virulent Vibrio cholerae O 1. Jejunal {{colonization}} occurred {{only when}} hypoperistalsis was induced {{at the time}} of inoculation by tincture of opium given intraperitoneally (or by <b>temporary</b> ileal <b>obstruction).</b> For oral inoculation, prior neutralization of gastric acid was also required. Inoculation with 10 (9) V. cholerae caused jejunal colonization for 1 to 2 days and ileal colonization for 5 to 6 days. The extent of small bowel colonization 18 h after oral inoculation was related to inoculum size but also reflected limited multiplication of small inoculum sizes and net death, clearance of large inoculum sizes, or both. Serious diarrhea occurred only in rabbits fed large inoculum sizes, i. e., 10 (10) V. cholerae, and then rarely. Rabbits colonized once with 10 (10) V. cholerae became highly resistant to recolonization with either the same or opposite serotype. After 18 weeks, these rabbits were still partially protected, whereas twice-colonized rabbits were highly protected. Protection against recolonization appeared to be due, at least partly, to interference with the adherence of V. cholerae to the bowel mucosa, thus allowing rapid removal of V. cholerae when peristalsis resumed. Prior colonization also protected against cholera-like diarrhea in rabbits challenged by the removable intestinal tie-adult rabbit diarrhea technique, the 50 % effective dose for severe or lethal diarrhea being increased more than 100 -fold, and probably more than 10, 000 -fold, for challenge with either the homologous or heterologous serotype of V. cholerae. The described rabbit model appears well suited for the study of immunity evoked by enteric colonization with V. cholerae O 1...|$|R
40|$|EPO and α-MSH prevent ischemia/reperfusion-induced {{down-regulation}} of AQPs {{and sodium}} transporters in rat kidney. BackgroundIschemia-induced {{acute renal failure}} (ARF) {{is known to be}} associated with significant impairment of urinary concentrating ability and down-regulation of renal aquaporins (AQPs) and sodium transporters in rats. We tested whether treatment with erythropoietin (EPO) or α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) in combination with EPO reduces the renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and prevents the down-regulation of renal AQPs and major sodium transporters. MethodsI/R-induced ARF was established in rats by 40 -minute <b>temporary</b> bilateral <b>obstruction</b> of renal arteries, and rats were kept in metabolic cages for urine measurements. After 2 or 4 days following EPO and/or α-MSH treatment, kidneys were removed to determine the expression levels of AQPs and sodium transporters by semiquantitative immunoblotting. ResultsRats with ARF showed significant renal insufficiency, increased urine output, and high fractional excretion of urinary sodium. Consistent with this, immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry revealed that the kidney expression of AQPs (AQP- 1, - 2 and - 3) and sodium transporters [Na,K-ATPase, rat type 1 bumetanide-sensitive Na-K- 2 Cl cotransporter (BSC- 1), Na/H exchanger type 3 (NHE 3), and thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter (TSC) ] in ARF rats was significantly decreased compared to sham-operated control rats. In contrast, EPO treatment at the time of ischemia of rats with ARF significantly prevented the ischemia-induced down-regulation of renal AQPs and sodium transporters and in parallel improved the urinary concentrating capability and renal sodium reabsorption. Importantly, similar effects were observed following the initiation of EPO or α-MSH treatment 4 hours after the onset of ischemia injury. Moreover, the combination of EPO with α-MSH potentiated the beneficial effects of single compound treatment. ConclusionEPO and/or α-MSH treatment significantly prevent I/R-induced injuries such as urinary-concentrating defects and down-regulation of renal AQPs and sodium transporters...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect on}} {{ileostomy}} function of codeine phosphate, Lomotil, or Isogel was tested in 20 subjects at home living a normal life, studied over two three-day periods {{on and off}} treatment. Codeine phosphate 60 mg three times daily {{was associated with a}} reduction in the mean total weight of ileostomy output and the ileostomy outputs of water, sodium, and potassium (p < 0 · 05). The proportion of faecal solids increased on codeine and the effluent appeared thicker but the output of faecal solids remained unchanged. Mean faecal fat increased on codeine. The transit rate from mouth to stoma was slower in four of the five subjects on codeine and a further two subjects withdrew from the trial with <b>temporary</b> intestinal <b>obstruction</b> while on the drug. Lomotil two tablets three times daily was associated with a small and statistically not quite significant fall in the mean total weight of ileostomy output and the ileostomy output of water. Sodium and potassium outputs in the effluent fell on Lomotil (p < 0 · 05) but the other parameters remained unchanged. Isogel 15 ml three times daily was associated with an increase in the mean total weight of ileostomy output and the ileostomy outputs of water, sodium, potassium, and faecal solids (p < 0 · 01). Although the effluent looked more viscid on Isogel, the proportion of faecal solids was unchanged. These results suggest that codeine phosphate has a beneficial effect on ileostomy function, reducing the loss of water and electrolytes, while Lomotil has a similar but less effective action in the dosage tested. By contrast, Isogel increases the ileostomy loss of water and electrolytes and will aggravate their depletion in patients with excessive fluid effluents. The increase in faecal fat associated with taking codeine phosphate suggests that it should be stopped before collecting specimens for faecal fat estimations...|$|R
