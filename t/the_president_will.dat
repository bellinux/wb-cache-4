Also under Article 79, the honor and dignity of <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>will</b> be protected by national law. Information, either printed in the news or reported on television, that is considered defamation against {{the president}} is illegal under Article 5 of the Belarusian Law on Press.|$|E
5|$|Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey) is {{an ambitious}} Democratic congressman and the House Majority Whip. Underwood helped ensure the {{election}} of President Garrett Walker (Michel Gill), who promised to appoint Underwood as Secretary of State. However, before Walker is sworn in, Chief of Staff Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey) announces that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>will</b> not honor the agreement and will instead nominate Senator Michael Kern. Furious at Walker's betrayal, Underwood and his wife Claire (Robin Wright), an environmental activist, make a pact to destroy Kern. When Zoe Barnes (Kate Mara) makes her resources available, she becomes one of their pawns.|$|E
5|$|Roadblock, Flint, and Lady Jaye {{return to}} the United States where {{they set up a}} base of {{operations}} in a rundown gym. After Zartan announces that Cobra will replace the Joes as the premier U.S. special forces unit, Lady Jaye deduces that someone is impersonating the President, and Roadblock leads them to General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis), who provides them with weapons, and helps them infiltrate a fundraising event that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>will</b> be attending. Lady Jaye steals a sample of the President's DNA and confirms that he is Zartan. They escape after a confrontation with Firefly and Zandar (Matt Gerald), the head of the U.S. Secret Service's Presidential Detail and a member of Cobra.|$|E

5|$|When Article 5A {{is brought}} into force, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>will</b> {{also be able to}} decline to assent to a bill seeking to amend the Constitution that has a direct or {{indirect}} effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. In this case, the Cabinet may also advise the President to refer to the Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill indeed has this effect. If the Tribunal rules that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the Tribunal pronounces its opinion in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal decides to the contrary, the Prime Minister may opt to submit the bill to the electorate. If the bill is supported at a national referendum by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the results of the referendum have been published in the Government Gazette.|$|E
25|$|On 10 May further {{amendments}} to the Turkish constitution were officially passed by parliament, 376 to 1. According to the amendments, general elections {{will be carried out}} every four years rather than five. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>will</b> now serve a maximum of two five-year terms instead of an unrestricted number of seven-year terms. <b>The</b> <b>president</b> <b>will</b> now be elected by the people rather than the parliament. President Sezer has 15 days to review the amendments and {{decide whether or not to}} veto and return the {{amendments to}} the parliament.|$|E
25|$|Parliament {{will choose}} {{some of the}} members of the Constitutional Court. The number of Constitutional Court members will be expanded. Parliament will appoint three members while <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>will</b> appoint 14 members.

50|$|The Prime Minister of Sri Lanka {{is driven}} in a Black Mercedes-Benz S-Class (Guard) escorted by Prime Minister's Security Division vehicles. The general {{practice}} remains that <b>the</b> out going <b>President</b> <b>will</b> take <b>the</b> vehicles {{used in his}} or her term for use in retirement and <b>the</b> incoming <b>President</b> <b>will</b> purchase new ones. Same applies to the Prime Minister if he or she moves on to the post of Leader of the Opposition.|$|R
25|$|The National Assembly {{passed the}} law banning {{therapeutic}} abortions on 26 October 2006. It is widely expected that <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>will</b> sign it.

25|$|The President {{may also}} {{dissolve}} Parliament by proclamation if advised by the Prime Minister to do so, {{although he is}} not obliged to so act unless he is satisfied that the Prime Minister commands the confidence {{of a majority of}} MPs. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>will</b> usually be asked to dissolve Parliament in this manner if the Prime Minister wishes to call a general election.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>president</b> {{is elected}} for a {{four-year}} term and, since 2005, can be re-elected for one consecutive term. The 1991 constitution reestablished {{the position of}} vice president, who is elected on the same ticket as <b>the</b> <b>president.</b> By law, <b>the</b> vice <b>president</b> <b>will</b> succeed in <b>the</b> event of <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> resignation, illness, or death.|$|R
50|$|According to a The Washington Quarterly article {{written by}} Ian Bremmer and Samuel Charap in 2006-2007, {{at the start}} of his presidency, Vladimir Putin {{announced}} that he would consolidate political powers in Russia into the so-called power vertical. However, despite being considered successful by many, this controversial endeavour partially backfired and led to the increasing factionalism within <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> inner circle. Although other institutions now became largely irrelevant, disputes and clashes between Kremlin factions, rather than <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> <b>will,</b> are getting more and more important in determining major policy outcomes, Bremmer and Charap write.|$|R
25|$|Lastly {{once the}} President of Singapore has arrived (after the playing of the Presidential Fanfare by the Fanfare Trumpeters of the SAF), the Parade Commander will {{call for a}} full (Presidential) salute, during which the National Anthem, Majulah Singapura, will be played {{accompanied}} by a fly-past of the State Flag, and from 2011, would also require raising it as well on a separate flagpole. After that (and the following aerial salute by the RSAF), the Parade Commander will request that the President inspects the parade. During this inspection, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>will</b> be accompanied by the Chief of Defence Force and the Parade Commander, and the Army GOH Contingent Commander would later join them once they approach the Guard-of-Honour (recent parades have seen a motorized inspection by the President while riding a Land Rover). A presidential 21-gun salute is also given to the President during this time by a select battery from the Singapore Artillery. It is customary that the President speaks to {{some members of the}} Guard-of-honor contingents as he passes by. After the inspection ends, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>will</b> return to the podium before the Guard-of-honor contingents presents a Feu-de-Joie led by the Parade Commander.|$|E
25|$|As soon as an oral case {{presentation}} is finished, the justices retire for a closed {{meeting to discuss}} and vote on the case. One justice will {{be held responsible for}} introducing the matter and proposing a solution of the case and he or she will usually write the opinion of the Court. If the views of the reporting justice do not have the support of a majority of the justices, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>will</b> ask another justice to write the Court’s opinion, and the minority justices decide who will write a separate dissenting judgement. Finally, a complete judgement will be prepared, and the justices will sign a single copy which is filed in the Book of Opinions of the Court.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Article 5A deals with {{attempts}} {{to alter the}} President's power by amending the Constitution itself. When the provision is brought into force, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>will</b> {{also be able to}} decline to assent to a bill seeking to amend the Constitution that has a direct or indirect effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. In this case, the Cabinet may also advise the President to refer to the Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill indeed has this effect. If the Tribunal rules that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the Tribunal pronounces its opinion in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal decides to the contrary and the Government wishes to push the amendment through in the face of the President's opposition to it, the Prime Minister may opt to submit the bill to the electorate. If the bill is supported at a national referendum by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the results of the referendum have been published in the Government Gazette.|$|E

500|$|In {{the third}} season, Ryan takes charge of Division {{to clean up}} its own mess by recalling all the agents at which point President Kathleen Spencer (Michelle Nolden) will grant the agents freedom (as all were {{recruited}} against their will). However, Nikita later learns <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>will</b> have Division terminated should they fail. Nikita and others work to find rogue agents who refused the recall order, nicknamed the [...] "Dirty Thirty", until her efforts are focused on Amanda, who {{is also on the}} run and later working with a company nicknamed [...] "The Shop", who developed sophisticated technologies, some of which was used by Division. Michael and Nikita become engaged, but their relationship faces further tention after Nikita cuts off his right hand to save his life. An advanced prosthetic is eventually discovered, but it is later revealed to have been laced with nano-cells that would kill Michael unless Nikita assassinates Spencer. [...] When Michael lies to her that a cure has been found, Nikita stands down. However Spencer shoots herself in the head (she is later revealed to be a double by The Shop; the real Spencer was captured and imprisoned). Framed for her death, Nikita becomes that most wanted person in the United States. She goes on the run, but leaves Michael behind.|$|E

2500|$|The president's role {{is largely}} political, {{preparing}} {{the work of}} the European Council, organising and chairing its meetings, seeking to find consensus among its members and reporting to the European Parliament after each meeting; <b>the</b> <b>president</b> <b>will</b> also [...] "at his level and in that capacity, ensure the external representation of the Union on issues concerning its common foreign and security policy, without prejudice to the powers of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security". Some overlap between the roles of the President of the European Council, the President of the Commission, and the High Representative—notably in foreign policy—leaves uncertainty about how much influence the President of the European Council will acquire.
