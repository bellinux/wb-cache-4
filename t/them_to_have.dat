5|$|A taxonomic {{proposal}} {{based on}} DNA studies has recommended classifying Elanus kites {{as a separate}} family (Elanidae). A 2004 molecular study of cytochrome-b DNA sequences shows <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> split off from typical hawks and eagles at an earlier date than the Osprey, which has been classified in its own family.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 the Crusaders had a {{very good}} start to the season before a poor finish with three losses in four games caused <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to travel to Orlando Stadium, Soweto to face the Bulls. They lost the semi-final 39–24.|$|E

5|$|All {{dates of}} the dollar also exist in proof finish. The 1999 coins were sold as {{standalone}} proof strikes, rather than {{as part of a}} larger proof set, as the 1979, 1980 and 1981 issues were offered. The 1999 proof was minted exclusively at the Philadelphia Mint, and bears a 'P' mint mark, while all other proof Anthony dollars were minted at San Francisco and bear the 'S' of that Mint. Some 1979 and 1981 proofs bear a mint mark which was applied to the coinage dies with a different punch, causing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a more legible appearance. They are considered scarce and are valued considerably higher than normal proofs of the series.|$|E
5|$|Capcom's {{partnership}} with Marvel Comics began in 1993 {{with the release}} of The Punisher, an arcade beat 'em up based on the comic book series of the same name. Capcom then created their first Marvel-based fighting game, X-Men: Children of the Atom, in 1994. Marvel Super Heroes soon followed in 1995. Many of the gameplay mechanics used in the Marvel vs. Capcom series were first developed and refined in these two fighting games, serving as precursors to the series. In 2011, then-current Capcom USA Strategic Marketing Director of Online and Community Seth Killian stated that many fighting game aficionados, including himself, consider <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> laid the foundation for the series.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{analysis}} of fresh fruit bodies collected in Mexico showed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the following composition: moisture 94.53%; ash 0.323%; dietary fiber 3.024%; fat 0.368%; and protein 1.581%. The {{free fatty acid}} content of dried fruit bodies was 4.5%, slightly more than the common button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), which had 3.5%. The majority of this total was oleic acid (1.95%), followed by linoleic acid (1.68%) and palmitic acid (1.69%).|$|E

They gradually find out everything about Shravan's parents and the household, and reunite after confessing their love for each other.|$|R
5|$|Genetic {{patterns}} {{suggest that}} green-head ant workers mate with unrelated males from distant colonies. The relatedness among workers {{is also very}} low, {{and there is a}} high proportion of gamergate ants. If the gamergates are all unrelated, the number of gamergates living in a nest can reach as many as nine; all of these gamergates contribute to the reproduction of young. The average number of gamergates can still be very high if they are related and get a larger share in reproduction. Most of the time, however, gamergates are generally unrelated, and it is uncommon for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a degree of relatedness. In many colonies, workers and gamergates police young females, which prevents them from reproducing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1814, Hogg first met Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin while visiting William Godwin with Percy Shelley. Soon Hogg heard that Shelley had {{abandoned}} Harriet and eloped with Mary to Continental Europe. They returned later that year and Hogg was re-introduced to Mary in November 1814. Although she was initially cool towards him, Mary soon began to enjoy his frequent visits. Hogg became very attracted to Mary Shelley, and when Percy learned of his feelings towards her he encouraged both of <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an affair, {{as an expression of}} free love. Mary, too, valued free love and was initially open to the idea, until she learned that she was pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Lobengula {{refused to}} allow any of the izinDuna to sign the document. Exactly why he did this is not clear. Rudd's {{interpretation}} was that the king considered <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> already been consulted at the day's indaba, and so {{did not think it}} necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might have felt that it would be harder to repudiate the document later if it bore the marks of his izinDuna alongside his own.|$|E

5|$|On June 18, 2015, Manitoba Premier Greg Selinger {{became the}} first {{politician}} to issue a formal apology for the government's role in the Sixties Scoop. Class action lawsuits have been brought against the Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario governments for the harm caused to victims of the large-scale adoption scheme that saw thousands of Indigenous children forcibly removed from their parents in the 1960s. Indigenous leaders responded by insisting that while apologies were welcomed, action – including a federal apology, reunification of families, compensation and counselling for victims – must accompany words for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> real meaning.|$|E
5|$|Some {{coastal cities}} {{surrendered}} to the Romans which allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a base in the coastal regions of Laconia. Gythium was a large city and {{had been made by}} the Spartans as their main port and naval arsenal. The Romans advanced upon the city and they were joined there by the combined Rhodian and Pergamese fleets. The sailors from the Roman, Pergamese and Rhodian fleets built siege engines which had devastating effects on the walls. One of the city's joint commanders, Dexagoridas, offered to surrender the city to the Roman legate in charge of the fleet while Flamininus was gone. When the other commander Gorgopas found out he murdered Dexagoridas.|$|E
5|$|The Behar {{survivors}} were maltreated {{by members}} of Tones crew. Japanese sailors forced the survivors to hand over all their personal belongings of any value, and then used ropes to tie the survivors in painful positions which caused <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> difficultly breathing. The merchant ship's chief officer was beaten after he complained that treating civilians {{in such a way}} violated the Geneva Convention. However, the female survivors later had their ropes removed. When the survivors were taken below decks to be imprisoned they were badly beaten by Japanese sailors.|$|E

5|$|The Greek {{practice}} of grafting of their gods' names onto the planets {{was almost certainly}} borrowed from the Babylonians. The Babylonians named Phosphoros after their goddess of love, Ishtar; Pyroeis after their god of war, Nergal, Stilbon after their god of wisdom Nabu, and Phaethon after their chief god, Marduk. There are too many concordances between Greek and Babylonian naming conventions for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> arisen separately. The translation was not perfect. For instance, the Babylonian Nergal was a god of war, and thus the Greeks identified him with Ares. Unlike Ares, Nergal was also god of pestilence and the underworld.|$|E
5|$|The semifinals of the Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament followed, {{beginning}} with Team 3D pitted against Cage and Rhino {{in the sixth}} encounter. The bout lasted ten minutes. Before the contest, the TNA commentators announced that Booker T's attack on Cage and Rhino had caused <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> concussions in the storyline. During the contest, Team 3D associate Johnny Devine came to the ring and handed Ray a kendo stick without the referee's knowledge. Although Rhino tackled Devon and went for the cover, Devine entered the ring to distract the referee, allowing Ray to hit Rhino with the kendo stick and cover to win the contest for his team.|$|E
5|$|The {{sizes of}} both moons are {{calculated}} {{with the assumption}} that they have the same infrared albedo as Haumea, which is reasonable as their spectra show <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the same surface composition. Haumea's albedo has been measured by the Spitzer Space Telescope: from ground-based telescopes, the moons are too small and close to Haumea to be seen independently. Based on this common albedo, the inner moon, Namaka, which is a tenth the mass of Hiʻiaka, would be about 170km in diameter.|$|E

Using an RB26DETT engine from a Japanese-exclusive Nissan Skyline, they were one of the few teams unable to repair their engine on-site. They were towed to both leg finish lines, which in turn led <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> the highest time and be eliminated.|$|R

Shafer). Their meal initially goes well, but Phyllis and Bob disappear for a while after their food arrives. Hungry and not wanting to be rude by eating before they get back, Jim and Pam check the bathrooms and hear Phyllis and Bob having sex in the disabled bathroom. Phyllis and Bob finally come back to their table and Jim and Pam lose their appetites and look on in disgust as Phyllis and Bob seductively put food in each other's mouths.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} {{work on the}} Spyro the Dragon series, Insomniac originally intended to launch a game codenamed I5 (Insomniac game #5) for the PlayStation 2. The developers, however, were never enthusiastic about it, and the idea was dropped after six months. Ratchet & Clank {{was based on an}} idea by Brian Hastings, which would feature a space-traveling reptile alien who would collect various weapons as he progressed through the game; Ratchet's final form was decided upon after Insomniac considered a space lizard with a tail and various terrestrial creatures, including dogs and rats; feline features stood out to the developers because of the associated sense of agility. Another early idea was to have a three small robots attached to Ratchet, which would perform different functions. However, Insomniac realized that having the robots was both complicated and created confusion about Ratchet's appearance, leading <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> only one robot, Clank.|$|E

Crysta is the apprentice of Magi, a motherly-figure fairy who imprisoned Hexxus in a tree. One day Crysta explores a new part of the forest and meets Batty, a bat {{who claims to have}} been experimented on by humans, giving him an obstreperous and unstable personality.
