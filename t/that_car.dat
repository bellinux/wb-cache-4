5|$|At {{the end of}} this week's episode, Rick is of {{the mind}} that they're square; they've got {{everything}} out in the open, they've each said their piece and they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and they're riding back in <b>that</b> <b>car</b> and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in <b>that</b> <b>car,</b> I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E
5|$|When Pearson bent {{the frame}} of his own race car early in the 1961 season, he began working as a house roofer in Spartanburg to support his family, which {{included}} two sons. Darel Dieringer had a contract dispute with a tire company and {{was not able to}} compete in the inaugural World 600 at Charlotte. Littlejohn was at the track, and he recommended <b>that</b> <b>car</b> builder Ray Fox hire Pearson. Pearson was unsure if he should join the team, and Fox was not convinced that he should trust his car to the relatively untested 26-year-old driver.|$|E
5|$|Remaining {{in such a}} {{position}} would require Mercedes-Benz to produce a competitive car for the 1936 season. Although the chassis of the W25 was shortened, and the engine was significantly upgraded to 4.74litres, the car proved inferior to the Type C developed by Auto Union. Mercedes had not improved the chassis to match the engine, and the W25 proved uncompetitive and unreliable. Despite this, Caracciola opened {{the season with a}} win in the rain at the Monaco Grand Prix, after starting from third position. He led the Hungarian Grand Prix early but retired with mechanical problems. At the German Grand Prix, he retired with a failed fuel pump, before taking over his teammate Hermann Lang's car; he later retired <b>that</b> <b>car</b> with supercharger problems. Caracciola led the Swiss Grand Prix for several laps, Rosemeyer trailing him closely, but the Clerk of the Course ordered Caracciola to cede the lead to Rosemeyer on the ninth lap after he was found to be blocking the Auto Union. The two had a heated argument after the race despite Caracciola's later retirement with a rear axle problem. Mercedes were so uncompetitive in 1936—Caracciola won only twice, in Monaco and Tunis—that Neubauer withdrew the team mid-season, leaving Rosemeyer to take the Championship for Auto Union.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} a closeup shot of Katy's face, {{surrounded}} by alternating red and blue lights, as she mouths the song's lyrics. It then changes to a mechanics' shop, where two young men are seen sitting, looking to the ground. Shots of sparks then appear in the screen, which emerge from a car. Katy {{is sitting on the}} automobile's passenger seat, while looking to her love interest, who is repairing the car, seemingly worried. She is later seen being driven by her boyfriend's group in <b>that</b> <b>car.</b> Her boyfriend is seen lying on a bed, and looking at the mirror, looking distantly. The car seen before finally arrives in a car parking lot where other cars are driving in circles. They exit their cars while others start driving again. The video's final scenes take place at the car parking lot, while the cars keep driving, with shots of women and other men sitting on the cars. The visual finally closes with a similar shot to that seen in the beginning, of Katy's face surrounded by lights, though now, her face is mixed with her love interest's.|$|E

25|$|Some leagues use a {{black flag}} {{with a white}} saltire. This is {{displayed}} with a car number if a driver ignores the other black flags {{for an extended period}} and also it indicates that <b>that</b> <b>car</b> is no longer being scored. In both NASCAR and IndyCar, the car is not scored again until it pays attention to the black flag by pitting once this flag is displayed.|$|E

25|$|Bud Moore Engineering {{debuted in}} 1961, at a {{qualifying}} {{race for the}} Daytona 500. The team won its debut with Joe Weatherly driving the No. 8 Pontiac. Weatherly drove for the team {{for most of the}} season, and won eight races. Bud Moore Engineering {{became one of the first}} multi-car teams in NASCAR history, fielding the No. 18 for five races. Bob Welborn, Fireball Roberts, Cotton Owens, and Tommy Irwin drove <b>that</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
25|$|Due to his {{extraordinary}} {{success on the}} racing track Brock became the Australian racing driver with the highest-profile as he undertook several media commitments. When not racing he often appeared on New Zealand television screens as a presenter; hosting motoring shows such as TV3's Police Stop (1996–1998) and TVNZ's Love <b>That</b> <b>Car</b> (2000). In Australia, Brock hosted a show similar to Police Stop known as Police Camera Action which was shown on the Seven Network (1996–98).|$|E

25|$|In October 1993, The Straits Times, Singapore's main English-language newspaper, {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>car</b> vandalism in Singapore {{was on the}} rise. Cars {{parked at}} apartment blocks were being damaged with hot tar, paint remover, red spray paint, and hatchets. Taxi drivers complained that their tires were slashed. In the city center, cars were found with deep scratches and dents. One man complained {{that he had to}} refinish his car six times in six months.|$|E
25|$|Off-board {{chargers}} can be {{as large}} as needed and mounted at fixed locations, like the garage or dedicated charging stations. Built with dedicated wiring, these chargers can handle much more power and charge the batteries more quickly. However, as the output of these chargers is DC, each battery system requires the output to be changed for <b>that</b> <b>car.</b> Modern charging stations have a system for identifying the voltage of the battery pack and adjusting accordingly.|$|E
25|$|On the one hand, {{this makes}} it {{incorrect}} to apply traditional statistics {{that are based on}} variance and standard deviation (such as regression analysis). On the other hand, this also allows for cost-efficient interventions. For example, given <b>that</b> <b>car</b> exhaust is distributed according to a power-law among cars (very few cars contribute to most contamination) it would be sufficient to eliminate those very few cars from the road to reduce total exhaust substantially.|$|E
50|$|On June 14, {{investigators}} {{reviewed the}} surveillance video footage and observed <b>that</b> the <b>car's</b> sunroof {{was similar to}} the one on Christensen's car.

25|$|A third {{bomb was}} detonated on a 6-car London Underground 1973 Stock Piccadilly line deep-level Underground train, number 311, {{travelling}} southbound from King's Cross St Pancras to Russell Square. The device exploded approximately one minute {{after the service}} departed King's Cross, by which time it had travelled about 500 yards (450m). The explosion occurred {{at the rear of}} the first car of the train—number 166—causing severe damage to the rear of <b>that</b> <b>car</b> as well as the front of the second one. The surrounding tunnel also sustained damage.|$|E
25|$|The only actual turbine powered Batmobile in {{existence}} is {{a replica of}} the 1989 film car. It is powered by a military Boeing turboshaft engine driving the rear wheels through a 4 speed semi-automatic transmission and is street registered. This car was designed and constructed by Casey Putsch of Putsch Racing in 2011. Putsch Racing also created a V8 powered replica complete with retractable firing machine guns, automated canopy, internet, GPS, police/military scanner, etc.. <b>That</b> <b>car</b> was also street registered in the United States.|$|E
25|$|From 1981 to 1985, Australia {{followed}} the Japanese convention by calling its car the Bluebird, {{and had a}} unique, facelifted rear-wheel-drive version for 1984 and 1985. <b>That</b> <b>car</b> was replaced in 1986 by the Nissan Pintara. It would {{be replaced by the}} successive Bluebird, also called Pintara, until 1992; then the range was brought in line with the Japanese model, for the U13 series from 1993 to 1997. In an unusual twist, brought about under the short lived Button Plan, the Pintara was also rebadged for Ford Australia as the Ford Corsair, reviving a Ford UK nameplate last used in the 1960s.|$|E
