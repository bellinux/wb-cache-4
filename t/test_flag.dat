In this setting, (1) the economy, by construction is effi- cient and produces the maximally possible amount of welfare for society, and (2) asset prices reflect the utility-maximizing behavior of consumers and the profit-maximizing behavior of firms.

30|$|The “skin test” rule type has {{the second}} highest {{override}} rate (41.5 %). Investigation reveals that this high override rate {{is caused by the}} discrepancy in physicians’ understanding of the “skin test” rule. In this system, the skin test rule is not designed as a mandatory requirement for the current specific patient, but a general risk reminder for nurses. That means, if there is potential allergic risk (either from medical literature or drug fact sheet) for a certain drug, physicians should set the skin <b>test</b> <b>flag</b> for corresponding medication orders. If not, the skin test rule will give an alert. When it comes to the drug administrating phase, the nurses will investigate this flag as well as patient’s specific conditions (e.g. known allergy history towards certain drugs) to judge whether skin test is needed. However, many physicians treated the “skin test” rule as patient-specific flags, i.e. if a certain drug has potential allergic risk, but the physician already knows the current patient is not allergic to this drug, he/she will not set the flag and override the skin test alert.|$|E

40|$|Machine Learning (ML) {{models are}} applied {{in a variety}} of tasks such as network {{intrusion}} detection or Malware classification. Yet, these models are vulnerable to a class of malicious inputs known as adversarial examples. These are slightly perturbed inputs that are classified incorrectly by the ML model. The mitigation of these adversarial inputs remains an open problem. As a step towards understanding adversarial examples, we show that they are not drawn from the same distribution than the original data, and can thus be detected using statistical tests. Using thus knowledge, we introduce a complimentary approach to identify specific inputs that are adversarial. Specifically, we augment our ML model with an additional output, in which the model is trained to classify all adversarial inputs. We evaluate our approach on multiple adversarial example crafting methods (including the fast gradient sign and saliency map methods) with several datasets. The statistical <b>test</b> <b>flags</b> sample sets containing adversarial inputs confidently at sample sizes between 10 and 100 data points. Furthermore, our augmented model either detects adversarial examples as outliers with high accuracy (> 80 %) or increases the adversary's cost - the perturbation added - by more than 150 %. In this way, we show that statistical properties of adversarial examples are essential to their detection. Comment: 13 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables.

2500|$|David Watt's 2004 {{textbook}} also analyzes {{exception handling}} {{in the framework}} of sequencers (introduced in this article in the section on early exits from loops). Watt notes that an abnormal situation, generally exemplified with arithmetic overflows or input/output failures like file not found, is a kind of error that [...] "is detected in some low-level program unit, but [...] a handler is more naturally located in a high-level program unit". For example, a program might contain several calls to read files, but the action to perform when a file is not found depends on the meaning (purpose) of the file in question to the program and thus a handling routine for this abnormal situation cannot be located in low-level system code. Watts further notes that introducing status <b>flags</b> <b>testing</b> in the caller, as single-exit structured programming or even (multi-exit) return sequencers would entail, results in a situation where [...] "the application code tends to get cluttered by tests of status flags" [...] and that [...] "the programmer might forgetfully or lazily omit to <b>test</b> a status <b>flag.</b> In fact, abnormal situations represented by status flags are by default ignored!" [...] Watt notes that in contrast to status <b>flags</b> <b>testing,</b> exceptions have the opposite default behavior, causing the program to terminate unless the programmer explicitly deals with the exception in some way, possibly by adding explicit code to ignore it. Based on these arguments, Watt concludes that jump sequencers or escape sequencers aren't as suitable as a dedicated exception sequencer with the semantics discussed above.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Meteorological {{observations}} {{from more than}} 250 stations in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea coastal, interior, and offshore regions were gathered and quality-controlled for the period 1979 through 2009. These stations represent many different observing networks that operate in the region {{for the purposes of}} aviation, fire weather, coastal weather, climate, surface radiation, and hydrology and report data hourly or sub-hourly. A unified data quality control (QC) has been applied to these multi-resource data, incorporating three main QC procedures: the threshold test (identifying instances of an observation falling outside of a normal range); the step change test (identifying consecutive values that are excessively different); and the persistence <b>test</b> (<b>flagging</b> instances of excessively high or low variability in the observations). Methods previously developed for daily data QC do not work well for hourly data because they flag too many data entries. Improvements were developed to obtain the proper limits for hourly data QC. These QC procedures are able to identify the suspect data while producing far fewer Type I errors (the erroneous flagging of valid data). The fraction of flagged data for the entire database illustrates that the persistence test was failed the most often (1. 34 %), followed by the threshold (0. 99 %) and step change tests (0. 02 %). Comparisons based on neighboring stations were not performed for the database; however, correlations between nearby stations show promise, indicating that this type of check may be a viable option in such cases. This integrated high temporal resolution dataset will be invaluable for weather and climate analysis, as well as regional modeling applications, in an area that is undergoing significant climatic change...|$|R

When predicting the performance of the system under new environment changes, our ensemble-based models significantly out-perform the baseline models.

40|$|Abstract—In {{previous}} work Hicks et al. proposed a method called Unused Circuit Identification (UCI) for detecting malicious backdoors hidden in circuits at design time. The UCI algorithm essentially looks for {{portions of the}} circuit that go unused during design-time <b>testing</b> and <b>flags</b> them as potentially malicious. In this paper we construct circuits that have malicious behavior, but that would evade detection by the UCI algorithm and still pass design-time test cases. To enable our search for such circuits, we define one class of malicious circuits and perform a bounded exhaustive enumeration of all circuits in that class. Our approach is simple and straight forward, yet it proves to be effective at finding circuits that can thwart UCI. We use {{the results of our}} search to construct a practical attack on an open-source processor. Our malicious backdoor allows any user-level program running on the processor to enter supervisor mode {{through the use of a}} secret “knock. ” We close with a discussion on what we see as a major challenge facing any future design-time malicious hardware detection scheme: identifying a sufficient class of malicious circuits to defend against.

Then, a “Virtual Eye” simulation model was developed that simulates series of sensitivity readings for a point over time. The model adds normally distributed noise (estimated from published results) to the sensitivity at each point to produce a series of fields to be analyzed using each method. Stable and deteriorating eyes were simulated, with the latter defined to have a noise-free loss of 2 dB/y at a significant cluster of points over the series. RESULTS.

Understanding the biology of the bacteria causing the disease, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), is thus vital. We have implemented improved screening methods for protein-protein interactions based on affinity purification followed by high-resolution mass spectrometry. This method can be efficiently applied to both medium- and high-throughput studies aiming to characterize protein-protein interaction networks of tubercle bacilli. Of the 4 <b>tested</b> epitopes <b>FLAG,</b> enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP), protein A and haemagglutinin, the eGFP tag was found to be most useful on account of its easily monitored expression and its ability to function as a simultaneous tool for subcellular localization studies. It presents a relatively low background with cost-effective purification. RNA polymerase subunit A (RpoA) was used as a model for investigation of a large protein complex. When used as bait, it co-purified with all remaining RNA polymerase core subunits as well as many accessory proteins. The amount of RpoA strongly correlated with the amount of quantification peptide used as part of the tagging system in this study (SH), making it applicable for semi-quantification studies. Interactions between the components of the RpoA-eGFP protein complex were further confirmed using protein cross-linking.
