40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of a search for members of the {{globular}} cluster Palomar 5 and its associated tidal tails. The analysis has been performed using intermediate and low resolution spectroscopy with the AAOmega spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. Based on kinematics, line strength and photometric information, we identify 39 new red giant branch stars along ∼ 20 ^∘ of the tails, a larger angular extent than has been previously studied. We also recover eight previously known tidal <b>tail</b> <b>members.</b> Within the cluster, we find seven new red giant and one blue horizontal branch members and confirm a further twelve known red giant members. In total, we provide velocity data for 67 stars in the cluster and the tidal tails. Using a maximum likelihood technique, we derive a radial velocity for Pal 5 of - 57. 4 ± 0. 3 km s^- 1 and a velocity dispersion of 1. 2 ± 0. 3 km s^- 1. We confirm and extend the linear velocity gradient along the tails of 1. 0 ± 0. 1 km s^- 1 deg^- 1, with an associated intrinsic velocity dispersion of 2. 1 ± 0. 4 km s^- 1. Neither the velocity gradient nor the dispersion change in any significant way with angular distance from the cluster, although there is some indication that the gradient may be smaller at greater angular distances in the trailing tail. Our results verify the tails as kinematically cold structures and will allow further constraints to be placed on the orbit of Pal 5, ultimately permitting a greater understanding of the shape and extent of the Galaxy's dark matter halo.

50|$|The pufflegs are {{hummingbirds}} {{from the}} genera Eriocnemis and Haplophaedia. They occur in humid forest, woodland and shrub at altitudes of 1000 to 4800 m. asl in the Andes of Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela. The males have a colorful green, coppery or blue plumage, and the females are generally somewhat duller. The most striking feature {{of both sexes}} is their dense snow-white leg puffs which consist of feather tufts that resemble woolly panties. One species - the black-thighed puffleg - is characterized by black coloured leg puffs, and another - the buff-thighed puffleg - has lightly buff-tinged leg puffs. Further common features of all species are the straight black bill and the slightly to deeply forked <b>tail.</b> The <b>members</b> of the genus Haplophaedia are generally duller than the members of Eriocnemis.|$|R

During one such mission, he fights with Acnologia, which causes him to loses an arm, a leg, and some of his internal organs. He is also the widowed father of Cana Alberona, but is unaware of his relationship with his daughter because his deceased wife Cornelia divorced him and give birth while he was away on a six-year mission. Twelve years later, Gildarts discovers the truth from Cana on Sirius Island, and begins doting on her in a comical fashion afterward.

They arrived at Earth in ancient times, the life-forms being carried along with a meteorite, {{crashing}} into the earth, and falling deep into its core. As time went on, the life-forms evolved, becoming the civilized Tailed-People Clan. The Tailed-People are a civilization of advanced science (higher than human's), with the rank of their civilization being determined {{by the number of}} tails. Believing Earth to be theirs, for their civilization to rise, they begin invasion. Originally planning to turn humans into their own kind, the experiment failed, and their strategy was changed to simply destroying mankind by reducing the number of human beings as the Tailed-People Clan was outnumbered. Being as the number of tails determines rank, the Emperor's dream is to obtain ten tails, who is said to provide one with eternal life and powers.

50|$|Lophopidae is {{a family}} of fulgoroid plant-hoppers with most species found in {{tropical}} South America and Asia (two genera occur in Africa).

The hind tibia can bear some spines, two to three (about four may be seen in the Eurybrachyidae). Lateral ocelli are present below the compound eye and slightly in front of it.

The illicium (a modified dorsal fin ray {{on the front of}} the head supporting the esca, a bulbous lure) can be retracted into an illicial cavity above the mouth. The esca is not luminous as in most other groups of anglerfishes, but secretes a fluid thought to act as a chemical lure, attracting prey. Analysis of their stomach contents indicates that batfishes feed on fish, crustaceans, and polychaete worms.|$|R
5000|$|According to Romer, the Archaeornithes are characterised {{by having}} clawed wings, a reptilian style ribcage without a large carina and the {{presence}} of a long, bony <b>tail.</b> The known <b>members</b> of the group by the time of its erection were Archaeopteryx and Archaeornis. [...] The two are now thought to represent a single species, Archaeopteryx lithographica, the Archaeornis being the Berlin specimen of Archaeopteryx.

Coming straight towards him, but high in the air, was a big bird, a bird with broad wings. Peter didn't have to look twice to know that it was a member of the Hawk family. At first he thought it was Redtail. Then he caught a flash of white, and he thought it was Whitetail the Marsh Hawk, in spite of the fact that it didn't fly like him. Peter didn't stop to think of that. It was enough for him that a member of the Hawk family was headed that way, and he didn't care a twitch of his funny little <b>tail</b> which <b>member</b> it was. He felt that the stomach of one was quite as undesirable a place for Peter Rabbit as the stomach of another, and he had no intention of filling any if he could help it.|$|R

The female is similar but the throat and breast are buff-ochre and the belly dull brown. In both sexes, the iris is red or orange and the bill is dark. The male is {{the only member of}} the genus without a contrasting throat patch. The female is similar in appearance to the stipple-throated antwren (Epinecrophylla haematonota), but that has no chestnut on its back. The song is a high-pitched, rather squeaky series of notes.|$|R
40|$|The {{class of}} {{symmetric}} linear regression models has the normal linear regression model {{as a special}} case and includes several models that assume that the errors follow a symmetric distribution with longer-than-normal <b>tails.</b> An important <b>member</b> of this class is the t linear regression model, which is commonly used {{as an alternative to}} the usual normal regression model when the data contain extreme or outlying observations. In this article, we develop second-order asymptotic theory for score tests in this class of models. We obtain Bartlett-corrected score statistics for testing hypotheses on the regression and the dispersion parameters. The corrected statistics have chi-squared distributions with errors of order O(n(- 3 / 2)), n being the sample size. The corrections represent an improvement over the corresponding original Rao`s score statistics, which are chi-squared distributed up to errors of order O(n(- 1)). Simulation results show that the corrected score tests perform much better than their uncorrected counterparts in samples of small or moderate size...|$|R
40|$|The G 12 {{subfamily}} of heterotrimeric G proteins, {{comprised of}} the α-subunits Gα 12 and Gα 13, has been implicated as a signaling component in cellular processes ranging from cytoskeletal changes to cell growth and oncogenesis. In {{an attempt to}} elucidate specific roles of this subfamily in cell regulation, we sought to identify molecular targets of Gα 12. Here we show a specific interaction between the G 12 subfamily and the cytoplasmic <b>tails</b> of several <b>members</b> of the cadherin family of cell-surface adhesion proteins. Gα 12 or Gα 13 binding causes dissociation of the transcriptional activator β-catenin from cadherins. Furthermore, in cells lacking the adenomatous polyposis coli protein required for β-catenin degradation, expression of mutationally activated Gα 12 or Gα 13 causes an increase in β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activation. These findings provide a potential molecular mechanism for the previously reported cellular transforming ability of the G 12 subfamily and reveal a link between heterotrimeric G proteins and cellular processes controlling growth and differentiation...|$|R
