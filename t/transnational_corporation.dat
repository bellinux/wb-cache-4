40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} {{the role played by}} officials of <b>transnational</b> <b>corporations</b> and <b>transnational</b> <b>corporations</b> themselves in the situation in Burma. The main aim of this dissertation is to assess the liability of officials of <b>transnational</b> <b>corporations</b> in Burma and <b>transnational</b> <b>corporations</b> in Burma for crimes against humanity such as slave labour and for war crimes such as plunder under International Criminal Law. However at present <b>transnational</b> <b>corporations</b> cannot be prosecuted under International Criminal Law as the International Criminal Court only has jurisdiction to try natural persons and not legal persons. In doing this analysis the theory of complicity, actus reus of aiding and abetting and the mens rea of aiding and abetting in relation to officials of <b>transnational</b> <b>corporations</b> will be explored and analysed to assess the liability of these officials in Burma. In doing this analysis the jurisprudence of inter alia the Nuremberg cases, the cases decided by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) will be used. This dissertation also examines the problems associated with suing or prosecuting <b>transnational</b> <b>corporations</b> due to the legal personality of <b>transnational</b> <b>corporations</b> and the structure of <b>transnational</b> <b>corporations.</b> At the end of the dissertation some recommendations are made so as to enable <b>transnational</b> <b>corporations</b> to be more transparent and accountable under the law...|$|R

25|$|Unions {{have made}} some {{attempts}} to organize across borders. Eder observes that transnational organizing {{is not a new}} phenomenon but has been facilitated by technological change. Nevertheless, he claims that while unions pay lip service to global solidarity, they still act largely in their national self-interest. He argues that unions in the global North are becoming increasingly depoliticized while those in the South grow politically, and that global differentiation of production processes leads to divergent strategies and interests in different regions of the world. These structural differences tend to hinder effective global solidarity. However, in light of the weakness of international labor, Herod writes that globalization of production need not be met by a globalization of union strategies in order to be contained. Herod also points out that local strategies, such as the United Auto Workers' strike against General Motors in 1998, can sometimes effectively interrupt global production processes in ways that they could not before the advent of widespread market integration. Thus, workers need not be connected organizationally to others around the world to effectively influence the behavior of a <b>transnational</b> <b>corporation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The VOC is {{generally}} considered to be the world's first truly <b>transnational</b> <b>corporation</b> and it was also the first multinational enterprise to issue shares of stock to the public. Some historians such as Timothy Brook and Russell Shorto consider the VOC as the pioneering corporation in the first wave of the corporate globalization era. The VOC was the first multinational corporation to operate officially in different continents such as Europe, Asia and Africa. While the VOC mainly operated in what later became the Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia), the company also had important operations elsewhere. It employed people from different continents and origins in the same functions and working environments. Although it was a Dutch company its employees included not only people from the Netherlands, but also many from Germany and from other countries as well. Besides the diverse north-west European workforce recruited by the VOC in the Dutch Republic, the VOC made extensive use of local Asian labour markets. As a result, the personnel of the various VOC offices in Asia consisted of European and Asian employees. Asian or Eurasian workers might be employed as sailors, soldiers, writers, carpenters, smiths, or as simple unskilled workers. At the height of its existence the VOC had 25,000 employees who worked in Asia and 11,000 who were en route. Also, while most of its shareholders were Dutch, {{about a quarter of the}} initial shareholders were Zuid-Nederlanders (people from an area that includes modern Belgium and Luxembourg) and there were also a few dozen Germans.|$|E

500|$|On September 23, 2009, the {{paramilitary}} EBP joined the political {{branch of the}} Macheteros, the Partido Revolucionario de los Trabajadores Puertorriqueños, in an event named Vigilia por la Dignidad held at Hormigueros, Puerto Rico, in honor of Ojeda Ríos. There both groups agreed that they would promote an agenda of unity with other sectors of society to confront what they perceived as [...] "a fascist repression" [...] being imposed {{by the government and}} manipulated by [...] " [...] that control large amounts of capital". The EPB and PRTP stated that Fortuño represented the [...] "lords of capital" [...] and that his administration was surrendering control of the government and justice system to these interests. The organizations argued that finality was economic gain {{at the expense of the}} public and that they employed open class warfare against it, approving laws without feedback and enforcing other measures. The EBP and PRTP concluded this communiqué by suggesting that public manifestations, armed resistance and independentist unity would be required to counteract the administration. In a different topic, the EPB provided an extended critique of the Puerto Rican statehood movement. In denoting what they believe is the [...] "true face of anexionism", referring to right-wing Republicans such as Fortuño, Rivera Schatz and Jennifer González, the group quoted Ojeda Ríos opinion of the newly elected governor. The EPB argued that those wealthy interests pushed Fortuño by exploiting modern propaganda methods, such as the internet and media, and that the federal government [...] "employed its creativity" [...] to ensure his election by indicting the former governor after the political campaign had begun. The organization interpreted this as a showcase of the [...] "power of <b>transnational</b> <b>corporation</b> to manipulate the economic and political" [...] system, and argued that the austerity measures were part of a plan to satisfy the bond-holders, multinationals, developers and businessmen and [...] "to present statehood as the only solution" [...] to an [...] "intentionally exacerbated crisis". The EBP also criticized unions for their perceived [...] "dispersion", [...] "lack of ideological definition" [...] and [...] "unwilliness to radicalize their struggle", asking them to seek coordinated efforts that entice [...] "the evolution of revolutionary postures within the middle class and the public in general". The organization then urged other independentist groups to cease cooperating with other entities that [...] "seek sovereignty but not independence", in particular with the free association movement, and to pursue unity to face the [...] "militaristic" [...] and [...] "repressive" [...] actions of an administration that [...] "leans towards dictatorship".|$|E

2500|$|The United East India Company or the United East Indian Company, {{also known}} as the United East Indies Company ( [...] ; or Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie in modern spelling; VOC), {{referred}} to by the British as the Dutch East India Company, or sometimes known as the Dutch East Indies Company, was originally established as a chartered company in 1602, when the Dutch government granted it a 21-year monopoly on the Dutch spice trade. A pioneering early model of the multinational corporation in its modern sense, the company is also often considered to be the world's first true <b>transnational</b> <b>corporation.</b> In the early 1600s, the VOC became the first company in history to issue bonds and shares of stock to the general public. In other words, the VOC was the world's first formally listed public company, {{because it was the first}} corporation to be ever actually listed on an official (formal) stock exchange. As the first historical model of the quasi-fictional concept of the megacorporation, the VOC possessed quasi-governmental powers, including the ability to wage war, imprison and execute convicts, negotiate treaties, strike its own coins, and establish colonies.|$|E
