On May 16, 1944, a razzia against the Romanies was organized in the whole of the Netherlands. Steinbach was arrested in Eindhoven. That very same day, she arrived with another 577 people in Westerbork concentration camp. Two hundred seventy-nine people were allowed to leave again because although they lived in trailers they were not Romanies. In Westerbork, Steinbach's head was shaved as a preventive measure against head lice.

He flung his arms on the table and dropped his head on them in tearless despair. The parting words that his tongue was powerless to utter his pen was powerless to write.

Works thus {{executed}} are {{of course}} despised, on account of their quantity, {{as well as their}} frequent slightness, in the places where they exist; and they are too large to be portable, and too vast and comprehensive to be read on the spot, in the hasty temper of the present age. They are, therefore, almost universally neglected, whitewashed by custodes, shot at by soldiers, suffered to drop from the walls, piecemeal in powder and rags by society in general; but, which is an advantage more than counterbalancing all this evil, they are not often [...] "restored." [...] What is left of them, however fragmentary, however ruinous, however obscured and defiled, is almost always the real thing; there are no fresh readings: and therefore the greatest treasures of art which Europe at this moment possesses are pieces of old plaster on ruinous brick walls, where the lizards burrow and bask, and which few other living creatures ever approach; and <b>torn</b> <b>sheets</b> of dim canvas, in waste corners of churches; and mildewed stains, in the shape of human figures, on the walls of dark chambers, which now and then an exploring traveller causes to be unlocked by their tottering custode, looks hastily round, and retreats from in a weary satisfaction at his accomplished duty.|$|E

Abstract. – We performed experiments in which tearing pieces of plastic produced a fractal boundary. Similar patterns are commonly observed {{at the edges}} of leaves. These patterns can be reproduced by imposing metrics upon thin sheets. We present an energy functional that provides a numerical test-bed for this idea, and derive a continuum theory from it. We find ordinary differential equations that provide minimum energy solutions for long thin strips with linear gradients in metric, and verify both numerically and experimentally the correctness of the solutions. Introduction. – Ifone takes a thin piece ofplastic, such as a garbage bag, and rips it in half, the edge takes on a complicated rippled form. We recently performed a careful experimental study of <b>torn</b> <b>sheets</b> and found the edge can have a fractal character, with waves superimposed upon waves over many generations [1].

40|$|The edge of <b>torn</b> elastic <b>sheets</b> {{and growing}} leaves often form a {{hierarchical}} buckling pattern. Within non-Euclidean plate theory this complex morphology {{can be understood}} as low bending energy isometric immersions of hyperbolic Riemannian metrics. With this motivation we study the isometric immersion problem in strip and disk geometries. By finding explicit piecewise smooth solutions of hyperbolic Monge-Ampere equations on a strip, we show there exist periodic isometric immersions of hyperbolic surfaces in the small slope regime. We extend these solutions to exact isometric immersions through resummation of a formal asymptotic expansion. In the disc geometry we construct self-similar fractal-like isometric immersions for disks with constant negative curvature. The solutions in both the strip and disc geometry qualitatively resemble the patterns observed experimentally and numerically in <b>torn</b> elastic <b>sheets,</b> leaves and swelling hydrogels. For hyperbolic non-Euclidean sheets, complex wrinkling patterns are thus possible within the class of finite bending energy isometric immersions. Further, our results identify the key role of the degree of differentiability (regularity) of the isometric immersion in determining the global structure of a non-Euclidean elastic sheet in 3 -space.

This are in obvious contrast to the maps of "The Late War" and a broadsheet "The Life of Johnny Tyler" on the wall behind Taylor. At Taylor's knee sits a bloodhound with a collar marked "Florida," a reminder of Taylor's controversial use of bloodhounds in the Second Seminole War. To the right two black youths polish Taylor's weapons. The first, kneeling and wiping a pistol, says, "By golly! Massa Taylor like fighting better then him dinner.
