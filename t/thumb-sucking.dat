6000|$|But by {{this time}} Mr. Barton has {{finished}} his pipe, the candle begins to burn low, and Mrs. Barton goes to see if Nanny has succeeded in lulling Walter to sleep. Nanny is that moment putting him in the little cot by his mother's bedside; the head, with its thin wavelets of brown hair, indents the little pillow; and a tiny, waxen, dimpled fist hides the rosy lips, for baby {{is given to the}} infantile peccadillo of <b>thumb-sucking.</b> So Nanny could now join in the short evening prayer, and all could go to bed. Mrs. Barton carried up-stairs the remainder of her heap of stockings, and laid them on a table close to her bedside, where also she placed a warm shawl, removing her candle, before she put it out, to a tin socket fixed at the head of her bed. Her body was very weary, but her heart was not heavy, in spite of Mr. Woods the butcher, and the transitory nature of shoe-leather; for her heart so overflowed with love, she felt sure she was near a fountain of love that would care for husband and babes better than she could foresee; so she was soon asleep. But about half-past five o'clock in the morning, if there were any angels watching round her bed--and angels might be glad of such an office they saw Mrs. Barton rise up quietly, careful not to disturb the slumbering Amos, who was snoring the snore of the just, light her candle, prop herself upright with the pillows, throw the warm shawl round her shoulders, and renew her attack on the heap of undarned stockings. She darned away until she heard Nanny stirring, and then drowsiness came with the dawn; the candle was put out, and she sank into a doze. But at nine o'clock she was at the breakfast-table, busy cutting bread-and-butter for five hungry mouths, while Nanny, baby on one arm, in rosy cheeks, fat neck, and night-gown, brought in a jug of hot milk-and-water. Nearest her mother sits the nine-year-old Patty, the eldest child, whose sweet fair face is already rather grave sometimes, and who always wants to run up-stairs to save mamma's legs, which get so tired of an evening. Then there are four other blond heads--two boys and two girls, gradually decreasing in size down to Chubby, who is making a round O of her mouth to receive a bit of papa's 'baton'. Papa's attention was divided between petting Chubby, rebuking the noisy Fred, which he did with a somewhat excessive sharpness, and eating his own breakfast. He had not yet looked at Mamma, and did not know that her cheek was paler than usual. But Patty whispered, 'Mamma, have you the headache?' ...|$|E

50|$|The {{first stage}} is the oral stage. An infant {{is in this}} stage from birth to {{eighteen}} months of age. The main focus in the oral stage is pleasure seeking through the infant’s mouth. During this stage the need for tasting and sucking becomes prominent in producing pleasure. Oral stimulation is crucial during this stage; if the infant’s needs are not met during this time frame {{he or she will}} be fixated in the oral stage. Fixation in this stage can lead to adult habits such as <b>thumb-sucking,</b> smoking, over-eating, and nail-biting. Personality traits can also develop during adulthood that are linked to oral fixation; these traits can include optimism and independence or pessimism and hostility.|$|E
50|$|When {{the teeth}} are biting down, the maxillary central incisors occlude with the mandibular central and lateral incisors. The contact {{point of the}} mandibular teeth is in the lingual fossa of the maxillary central incisor about 4 mm gingivally from the incisal edge.

When the maxillary and mandibular incisors do not contact even when the mouth is fully closed, an {{anterior}} open bite occurs. This misalignment of teeth may result from some habits, such as <b>thumb-sucking.</b> On the other hand, when the contact of the mandibular incisors to the maxillary incisors is near or completely on the gingiva, a deep bite occurs.|$|E

50|$|A {{herpetic}} whitlow is a lesion (whitlow) on {{a finger}} or thumb {{caused by the}} herpes simplex virus. It is a painful infection that typically affects the fingers or thumbs. Occasionally infection occurs on the toes or on the nail cuticle. Herpes whitlow {{can be caused by}} infection by HSV-1 or HSV-2. HSV-1 whitlow is often contracted by health care workers that come in contact with the virus; it is most commonly contracted by dental workers and medical workers exposed to oral secretions. It is also often observed in <b>thumb-sucking</b> children with primary HSV-1 oral infection (autoinoculation) prior to seroconversion, and in adults aged 20 to 30 following contact with HSV-2-infected genitals. Symptoms of herpetic whitlow include swelling, reddening and tenderness of the skin of infected finger. This may be accompanied by fever and swollen lymph nodes. Small, clear vesicles initially form individually, then merge and become cloudy. Associated pain often seems large relative to the physical symptoms. The herpes whitlow lesion usually heals in two to three weeks. It may reside in axillary sensory ganglia to cause recurrent herpetic lesions on that arm or digits.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the quad-helix/crib (Q-H/C) appliance in subjects with <b>thumb-sucking</b> habits and dentoskeletal open bite at 2 {{years after the end of}} active treatment. Materials and Methods: The records of 21 subjects treated with the Q-H/C appliance were compared with a control group of 21 untreated subjects with similar vertical relationships. Lateral cephalograms were obtained before treatment (T 1; mean age 8. 4 +/- 1. 4 years) and at about 2 years after treatment (T 2; mean age 11. 7 +/- 1. 9 years) and analyzed. Mean treatment duration was 1. 5 years +/- 7 months. The T 2 -T 1 changes in the two groups were compared with a nonparametric test for independent samples. Results: The mean increase in overbite during Q-H/C therapy (4. 1 mm) represented an overcorrection of the amount of anterior open bite at T 2. Both the maxillary and mandibular incisors showed significantly greater extrusion in the Q-H/C group than in the control group. The treated group showed a greater downward rotation (1. 8 degrees) of the palatal plane than did the control group. This change was associated with a clinically significant reduction in the palatal plane/mandibular plane angle (- 2. 5 degrees) in the Q-H/C group. The upper lip showed significant retraction relative to the E-plane in the treated group (3. 6 mm) compared with the controls. Conclusions: The Q-H/C appliance was effective in correcting dental open bite in 85 % of the growing subjects with <b>thumb-sucking</b> habits and dentoskeletal open bites.

40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of a quad-helix/crib (Q-H/C) appliance in a group of growing subjects with <b>thumb-sucking</b> habits and both dental and skeletal open bites. Methods: The records of 23 subjects treated with Q-H/C appliances were compared with a control group of 23 untreated subjects with similar vertical relationships. Lateral cephalograms were analyzed before treatment (T 1; mean age, 8. 4 +/- 1. 4 years) and immediately after treatment (T 2; mean age, 9. 9 +/- 1. 5 years). Mean duration of treatment was 1. 5 +/- 7 months. The T 2 -T 1 changes in the 2 groups were compared with a nonparametric test for independent samples (Mann-Whitney U test). Results: The average increase in overbite during Q-H/C therapy (3. 6 mm more than the control group) overcorrected the amount of anterior open bite at T 2. However, 4 of 23 subjects did not show positive overbites at T 2. Both the maxillary and mandibular incisors had significantly greater lingual inclinations (about 4. 0 degrees) associated with greater extrusion (1. 4 and 1. 0 mm, respectively) in the Q-H/C group than in the control group. In addition, the treated group showed a greater downward rotation (1. 2 degrees) of the palatal plane than did the control group. This change was associated with a greater increase in upper anterior facial height (0. 7 mm) and a clinically significant reduction in the palatal plane-mandibular plane angle (- 1. 7 degrees) in the Q-H/C group with respect to the controls. The upper and lower lips showed significant tendencies toward retraction relative to the E-plane in the treated group (2. 6 and 2. 9 mm, respectively) compared with the controls. Conclusions: The Q-H/C appliance was effective in correcting the dental open bite in 90 % of growing subjects with <b>thumb-sucking</b> habits and dentoskeletal open bites. The Q-H/C protocol produced a clinically significant improvement in the vertical skeletal relationships because of downward rotation of the palatal plane...|$|E
