40|$|Abstract- Ball swaging is a {{material}} process used {{to assemble a}} boss tower and an arm aperture. A swage ball is inserted into the boss tower <b>to</b> <b>swage</b> and couple two components. The swage ball has a larger diameter than an inner diameter of the boss tower, applies a compression force to the inner surface of the boss tower to hold both components together with adequate holding force and without damaging the boss tower. This study proposes a new design of the boss tower by relief ring width optimization. It reduces the arm tip deformation while avoiding HSA resonance and allows similar swaging quality by using single ball. The 3 -D FE method was used for analysis. The result analysis and experiment show boss tower deformation very similar. Although the variation of CTQ has been decreased, cleanliness has been improved. Moreover, non-circular arm aperture is able to reduce swage effect...|$|E

Composting and using of earthworms in this process {{is one of the}} most suitable methods for stabilization and removal of unsuitable {{properties of}} sewage sludge. To investigate the effects of kind and mixing proportion of bulking material and sewage sludge decomposition stage on vermicompost quality, an experiment was carried out in a split plot design with three replications. In this experiment, the stage of sewage decomposition (raw sewage, digested sludge in digester, dewatered sludge in lagoons, and final dried sludge in lagoons) was main factor and kind of bulking materials (woodchips, three leaves, and wheat straw) and mixing proportion of bulking materials <b>to</b> <b>swage</b> sludge (0, 15, 30, and 45 %, V/V) were as subordinate factors. Chemical properties of sewage in different decomposition stages and bulking materials were determined. After 5 months of incubation in the controlled moisture and temperature condition, and in the presence of earthworms, the pot's contents were harvested, and nutrients and heavy metal concentration of vermicomposts were measured. Vermicomposts had relatively low pH and EC. Their nutrients content especially N, P, Fe, and Zn were high. These properties showed vermicompost suitability for use as a soil amendment and organic fertilizer. Heavy metals concentrations of vermicomposts, except for Zn, were lower than recommended values by EPA. Despite no significant difference between the kinds of bulking materials, mixing of these materials with sewage sludge decreased pH, N, and Pb content of produced vermicompost.

40|$|Abstract only availableMolybdenum- 99 (Mo- 99) is used {{to create}} Tc- 99 m, a widely used nuclear {{medicine}} diagnostic imaging radioisotope. In an attempt to decrease the need for imported Mo- 99, development of mechanical systems to efficiently prepare low enriched uranium (LEU) sheets for radiation is needed. Once prepared, the LEU is radiated to create the Mo- 99. This process involves layering the LEU foil between two aluminum tubes, swaging the tubes together, and then sealing the ends. The current design, a die and nut/bolt drawn punch swaging system, and using Tig welding to seal the ends is inefficient and inconsistent. The new mechanical system for the swaging process {{is designed to be}} efficient and eliminate any inconsistency. Detailed design of the proposed hydraulic concept was established using 3 -D solid modeling software (Pro-Engineer) with 2 -D views of non standard parts for future construction. The designed assembly was analyzed for accuracy and proper fits and the entire systems swaging operation was virtually simulated to check for potential errors. The required swaging force was determined through analytical analysis process and initial test measurements. Adequate cylinder, pump, and pressure gauge sizes were determined to exceed the minimum required swaging force. By using a horizontally mounted hydraulic jack <b>to</b> <b>swage</b> the tubes, the applied pressure will be monitored using a pressure gauge to insure a steady swaging force. This design utilizes a sliding die with removable end cap to ease the removal of the swaged tubes. This feature also assists in maintenance and the removal of jammed parts. Using an electron microscope, a gap between the swaged tubes was found using the current punch design. After extensive calculations, a new punch was designed to prevent any unwanted spring back induced gap in the aluminum. To reduce the inconsistency in the tube sealing process, concepts in cold rolling are being further studied...|$|E

50|$|Because the {{strength}} of the steel BB does not allow it <b>to</b> be <b>swaged</b> with the low energies used to accelerate it through the barrel, BBs are slightly smaller (0.171 to 0.173 in) than the internal diameter of the barrel (0.177 in).

Since a BB will easily roll unhindered down the barrel, it is common to find guns that use a magnet in the loading mechanism to hold the BB {{at the rear of the}} barrel until it is fired.|$|R

Design reviews continued to require considerable attention. The Inspection Engineering Dept. of the Jab. continued to act as an inspection agency for the ALC, witnessing inspections and tests during fabrication of components of the nuclear reactor system. An enviromnental analysis was made of safeguard aspects of operation of the N. S. Savannah at the NYSC site in Cannden. A study of the safety response of the reactor on the ORNL Analog Computer further defined the important role of the Doppler coefficient in controlling reactivity excursions. Health physics aspects of the operation were studied. Limited waste disposal studies indicated that sea disposal of exhausted demineralizer resins may be facilitated by casting the radioactive resins into concrete. Installation of a pressurized-water in-pile test loop in the ORR neared completion. The neutron flux distribution in the loop was determined by experimental measurements in a nuclear mockup of the in-pile section. Metallurgical activities included nil-ductility testing of steel from the reactor vessel, chemical analyses of primary system components, and investigations of the properties of electroless - nickel brazed joints. Limited fabrication studies were carried out on advanced fuel concepts which may have merit for future cores of the Savannah Reactor.

40|$|With the aim to {{investigate}} modifications in electric resistivity, mechanical properties and structures of Al/Cu clad composites induced by various thermomechanical treatments, Al/Cu work-pieces were swaged under two temperatures to three final diameters and subsequently subjected to two different heat treatments. The {{influence of the}} two swaging temperatures on formability of the composites was evaluated via tensile and bending tests with integrated acoustic emission detection. The highest tensile strength (- 500 MPa) was recorded after the semi-final swaging pass for both of the composites. The strain imposed during the gradual swaging process significantly influenced hardness of both of the metals in the composites, the development of which was non-linear. Structure analyses confirmed restoration processes in Cu <b>to</b> occur during <b>swaging</b> <b>to</b> 5 mm at 25 degrees C, however, at 250 degrees C the restoration occurred during the last but one pass to 7. 5 mm already.

In a first step, the whole amount of Al is transformed to TiAl 3 by Al diffusion into Ti. This involves the formation of 12 % porosity. In a second step, the complete microstructure is transformed into the equilibrium state of -TiAl and TiAl 3.
