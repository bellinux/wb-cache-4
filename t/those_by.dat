5|$|A History of British Birds, Bewick's great {{achievement}} and with which {{his name is}} inseparably associated, was published in two volumes: History and Description of Land Birds in 1797 and History and Description of Water Birds in 1804, with a supplement in 1821. The Birds is specifically British, but is the forerunner of all modern field guides. Bewick was helped by his intimate knowledge of the habits of animals acquired during his frequent excursions into the country. He also recounts information passed to him by acquaintances and local gentry, and that obtained in natural history works of his time, including <b>those</b> <b>by</b> Thomas Pennant and Gilbert White, {{as well as the}} translation of Buffon's Histoire naturelle.|$|E

5|$|Characteristic {{diagnostic}} {{features of}} Entoloma murrayi include the bright yellow coloring, the conical cap, cube-shaped spores, and club-shaped cheilocystidia. Entoloma quadratum {{is similar in}} size and morphology, but is colored salmon-orange. E.murrayi has the habit and form of some similarly colored mushrooms in the genus Hygrocybe (such as Hygrocybe marginata var. concolor), {{but it can be}} readily distinguished from <b>those</b> <b>by</b> its salmon-pink spore print, non-waxy gills, and the angular shape of its spores. Entoloma luteum is a duller yellow color, with a less distinctly pointed umbo. The South American species E.dennisii, originally misidentified as E.murrayi, can be distinguished from the latter by its less conical cap and considerably smaller spores that measure 5.5–7μm.|$|E
