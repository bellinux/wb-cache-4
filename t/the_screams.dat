As they consume the spheres, a strange transformation occurs to each, changing the forms of their shadows into powerful beings that are able to destroy the robot army. The party escapes the base and crash in a desert.|$|E
5|$|John Wilkes Booth had {{originally}} planned to kidnap Lincoln, and recruited conspirators, including Lewis Powell. Having found {{no opportunity to}} abduct the president, on April 14, 1865, Booth assigned Powell to assassinate Seward, with George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Johnson and himself to kill Lincoln, which would slay the three {{senior members of the}} Executive Branch. Accordingly, another member of the conspiracy, David Herold, led Powell to the Seward home on horseback and was responsible for holding Powell's horse while he committed the attack. Seward had been hurt in an accident some days before, and Powell gained entry to the home on the excuse he was delivering medicine to the injured man, but was stopped {{at the top of the}} stairs by Frederick Seward, who insisted Powell give him the medicine. Powell instead attempted to fire on Frederick, and beat him over the head with the barrel of his gun when it misfired. Powell burst through the door, threw Fanny Seward (the secretary's daughter) to one side, and jumped on the bed, and stabbed William Seward in the face and neck five times. A soldier assigned to guard and nurse the secretary, Private George F. Robinson, jumped on Powell, forcing him from the bed. Powell fled, stabbing a messenger, Emerick Hansell, as he went, to find that Herold, panicked by <b>the</b> <b>screams</b> from the house, had left with both horses. Seward was at first thought dead, but revived enough to instruct Robinson to send for the police and lock the house until they arrived.|$|E

25|$|The {{method of}} {{construction}} of the torture chamber of the papal palace at Avignon, used during the Inquisition, {{has been described as}} ingenious. The construction of some of the torture chambers at Avignon was based on principles of Acoustics, specifically designed to muffle <b>the</b> <b>screams</b> and cries of the tortured. The walls of the torture chamber recessed and protruded in a complementary fashion to the walls on the opposite side so as to reflect <b>the</b> <b>screams</b> of the victims locally, ensuring that their shrieks would not be carried to the exterior. A chamber located above the main torture chamber had a dungeon with a hole near {{the middle of the floor}} through which, according to accounts, the tortured bodies of the prisoners were thrown into a cavity. The chamber where the victims were being burnt was of circular construction and resembled the furnace of a glass-house with a funnel-like chimney at the top.|$|E

Many survived the storm itself but died after several days being trapped under {{the wreckage of the}} city, with rescuers unable to reach them.

25|$|Serial killer Ian Brady, {{who with}} Myra Hindley carried out torture {{and murder of}} {{children}} known as the Moors murders in England during the 1960s, was fascinated by Sade, and the suggestion was made at their trial and appeals that the tortures of the children (<b>the</b> <b>screams</b> and pleadings of whom they tape-recorded) were influenced by Sade's ideas and fantasies. According to Donald Thomas, {{who has written a}} biography on Sade, Brady and Hindley had read very little of Sade's actual work; the only book of his they possessed was an anthology of excerpts that included none of his most extreme writings. In the two suitcases found by the police that contained books that belonged to Brady was The Life and Ideas of the Marquis de Sade. Hindley herself claimed that Brady would send her to obtain books by Sade, and that after reading them he became sexually aroused and beat her.|$|E
25|$|The {{lower parts}} of the Magdalena River were {{inhabited}} by numerous indigenous groups who resisted the Spanish conquistadors with canoes, fighting using poisoned arrows. This held the Spanish troops back and the reduced army joined forces on land in Sompallón, where they had lost already 100 men. The two conquistadors who reached this area first were Juan de Sanct Martín and Juan de Céspedes. Many of the disgruntled soldiers wanted {{to return to the}} relative safety of Santa Marta, but father Juan Domingo de las Casas persuaded the soldiers to continue, at the risk of being called cowards if they refused. The expedition split in two again, with one part ascending further the Magdalena River and the main part through the thick forests of the right bank of the river. Here they encountered many natural dangers, such as jaguars, wild boar, snakes, mosquitoes, spiders, stinky grisons and the many spines and poisonous plants in the forest. Even anteaters had attacked the troops and almost killed a horse. Pioneers with machetes were sent ahead to create pathways through the dense jungle, a task that could take up to 8 days for a path crossed by the army in hours. The troops took shelter from the heavy rains below trees and ate fruits and wild roots to survive. Many of the soldiers became ill and died due to snake bites and jaguar attacks. They crossed the many creeks and rivers tributary to the Magdalena swimming, where the caymans formed another risk. Apart from the natural hazards, also the indigenous people attacked the Spanish with their arrows, clubs and canoes. At night, when the soldiers were sleeping unprotected in their hammocks, the jaguars attacked and killed them, and in many cases <b>the</b> <b>screams</b> of the men were not heard because of the thunderstorms.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} twentieth century, <b>The</b> <b>Scream</b> was imitated, parodied, and (following its {{copyright}} expiration) outright copied, which led to it acquiring an iconic status in popular culture. It was used {{on the cover of}} some editions of Arthur Janov's book <b>The</b> Primal <b>Scream.</b> In 1983–1984, pop artist Andy Warhol made a series of silk prints copying works by Munch, including <b>The</b> <b>Scream.</b> His stated intention was to desacralize the painting by making it into a mass-reproducible object. Munch had already begun that process, however, by making a lithograph of the work for reproduction. Erró's ironic and irreverent treatment of Munch's masterpiece in his acrylic paintings <b>The</b> Second <b>Scream</b> (1967) and Ding Dong (1979) is considered a characteristic of post-modern art. The expression of Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) in the poster for the movie Home Alone was inspired by <b>The</b> <b>Scream.</b> Cartoonist Gary Larson included a [...] "tribute" [...] to <b>The</b> <b>Scream</b> (entitled <b>The</b> Whine) in his Wiener Dog Art painting and cartoon compilation, in which the central figure is replaced by a howling dachshund. <b>The</b> <b>Scream</b> has been used in advertising, in cartoons such as The Simpsons, films, and on television.
