5|$|American Cocker Spaniels are {{susceptible}} {{to a variety of}} illnesses, particularly infections affecting their ears and, in some cases, their eyes. Although the number or percent of afflicted dogs is not known, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), glaucoma, and cataracts have been identified in some members of the breed. The American Spaniel Club recommends annual eye exams by a veterinary ophthalmologist for all dogs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used for breeding. Autoimmune problems in Cockers have also been identified in an unknown number or percent of the breed, including autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). Ear inflammations are common in drop-eared breeds of dog, including the American Cocker, and luxating patellas and hip dysplasia have been identified in some members of the breed.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} game's early promotion, a {{scavenger}} hunt contest {{was announced}} {{in the last week}} of May 2009. Players would need to search for articles on specific game-related sites to find information on the bands <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in Guitar Hero 5, and then enter those bands at the game's official website for a chance to win a series of concert tickets in their area. Through this promotion, a large number of artists in the final track list were revealed.|$|E

5|$|While {{the valve}} is off, the threads of {{cylinder}} and valve are checked {{to identify the}} thread type and condition. The threads of cylinder and valve must be of matching thread specification, clean and full form, undamaged and free of cracks, burrs and other imperfections. Ultrasonic inspection may be substituted for the pressure test, which is usually a hydrostatic test and may be either a proof test or a volumetric expansion test, depending on the cylinder design specification. Test pressure is specified in the stamp markings of the cylinder. Valves <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reused are inspected and maintained to ensure they remain fit for service. Before fitting the valve the thread type must be checked {{to ensure that a}} valve with matching thread specification is fitted.|$|E
