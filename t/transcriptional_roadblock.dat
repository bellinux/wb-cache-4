40|$|We {{had earlier}} overproduced the {{transcription}} activator protein C of bacteriophage Mu in a phage-T 7 expression system. Although we achieved {{a high level}} of overproduction, the expression was not consistent. This could be due to the leaky expression of T 7 RNA polymerase in the uninduced state. Introduction of pLysS, a plasmid encoding T 7 lysozyme, a natural inhibitor of T 7 RNA polymerase, resulted in consistent, but extremely low production of the C protein. To overcome this problem, we have devised an artificial regulatory circuit to obtain stabilised, consistent overproduction of C protein. The C-binding site was cloned downstream from the transcription start point of T 7 lys. Upon induction, the C protein produced binds to its site with a very high affinity, possibly acting as a <b>transcriptional</b> <b>roadblock</b> for lys. This would overcome the inhibitory effect of T 7 lysozyme on T 7 RNA polymerase...|$|E
40|$|The {{interconnection}} between transcription and splicing is {{a subject}} of intense study. We report that Arabidopsis homologue of spliceosome disassembly factor NTR 1 is required for correct expression and splicing of DOG 1, a regulator of seed dormancy. Global splicing analysis in atntr 1 mutants revealed a bias for downstream 5 ' and 3 ' splice site selection and an enhanced rate of exon skipping. A local reduction in PolII occupancy at misspliced exons and introns in atntr 1 mutants suggests that directionality in splice site selection is a manifestation of fast PolII elongation kinetics. In agreement with this model, we found AtNTR 1 to bind target genes andÂ co-localise with PolII. A minigene analysis further confirmed that strong alternative splice sites constitute an AtNTR 1 -dependent <b>transcriptional</b> <b>roadblock.</b> Plants deficient in PolII endonucleolytic cleavage showed opposite effects for splice site choice and PolII occupancy compared to atntr 1 mutants, and inhibition of PolII elongation or endonucleolytic cleavage in atntr 1 mutant resulted in partial reversal of splicing defects. We propose that AtNTR 1 {{is part of a}} transcription elongation checkpoint at alternative exons in Arabidopsis...|$|E
40|$|Genomic DNA {{is bound}} by many {{proteins}} {{that could potentially}} impede elongation of RNA polymerase (RNAP), but the factors determining the magnitude of <b>transcriptional</b> <b>roadblocking</b> in vivo are poorly understood. Through systematic experiments and modeling, we analyse how roadblocking by the lac repressor (LacI) in Escherichia coli cells is controlled by promoter firing rate, the concentration and affinity of the roadblocker protein, the transcription-coupled repair protein Mfd, and promoter-roadblock spacing. Increased readthrough of the roadblock at higher RNAP fluxes requires active dislodgement of LacI by multiple RNAPs. However, this RNAP cooperation effect occurs only for strong promoters because roadblock-paused RNAP is quickly terminated by Mfd. The results are most consistent with a single RNAP also sometimes dislodging LacI, though we cannot exclude {{the possibility that a}} single RNAP reads through by waiting for spontaneous LacI dissociation. Reducing the occupancy of the roadblock site by increasing the LacI off-rate (weakening the operator) increased dislodgement strongly, giving a stronger effect on readthrough than decreasing the LacI on-rate (decreasing LacI concentration). Thus, protein binding kinetics can be tuned to maintain site occupation while reducing detrimental roadblocking. Nan Hao, Sandeep Krishna, Alexandra Ahlgren-Berg, Erin E. Cutts, Keith E. Shearwin, and Ian B. Dod...|$|R
40|$|In Bacillus subtilis, carbon catabolite {{repression}} (CCR) of many genes is mediated at cis-acting carbon repression elements (cre) by the catabolite repressor protein CcpA. Mutations in transcription-repair coupling factor (mfd) partially relieve CCR at cre sites located downstream of transcriptional start sites by abolishing the Mfd-mediated displacement of RNA polymerase stalled at cre sites which act as <b>transcriptional</b> <b>roadblocks.</b> Although the acsA cre is centered 44. 5 bp downstream of the acsA transcriptional start site, CCR of acsA expression is {{not affected by}} an mfd mutation. When the acsA cre is centered 161. 5 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site for the unregulated tms promoter, CCR is partially relieved by the mfd mutation. Since CCR mediated at an acsA cre centered 44. 5 bp downstream of the tms start site is not affected by the mfd mutation, the inability of Mfd to modulate CCR of acsA expression most likely results from {{the location of the}} acsA cre. Higher levels of CCR were found to occur at cre sites flanked by A+T-rich sequences than at cre sites bordered by G and C nucleotides. This suggests that nucleotides adjacent to the proposed 14 -bp cre consensus sequence participate {{in the formation of the}} CcpA {{catabolite repression}} complex at cre sites. Examination of CCR of acsA expression revealed that this regulation required the Crh and seryl-phosphorylated form of the HPr proteins but not glucose kinase...|$|R
