50|$|The acidity of hides {{once they}} have {{finished}} pickling will typically be between pH of 2.8-3.2. At this point the hides are loaded in a drum and immersed in a float containing the <b>tanning</b> <b>liquor.</b> The hides are allowed to soak (while the drum slowly rotates about its axle) and the <b>tanning</b> <b>liquor</b> slowly penetrates through the full substance of the hide. Regular checks {{will be made to}} see the penetration by cutting the cross section of a hide and observing the degree of penetration. Once an even degree of penetration is observed, the pH of the float is slowly raised in a process called basification. This basification process fixes the tanning material to the leather, and the more tanning material fixed, the higher the hydrothermal stability and increased shrinkage temperature resistance of the leather. The pH of the leather when chrome tanned would typically finish somewhere between 3.8-4.2.|$|E
50|$|Many tanning {{methods and}} {{materials}} exist. The choice ultimately {{depends on the}} end application for the leather. The most common tanning material is chromium, which leaves the tanned leather a pale blue color (due to the chromium). This product is commonly called wet blue. The hides, when finished pickling, are typically between pH 2.8 and 3.2. At this point, tannery workers load the hides into a drum and immerse them in a float that contains the <b>tanning</b> <b>liquor.</b> The hides soak while the drum slowly rotates about its axis, and the <b>tanning</b> <b>liquor</b> slowly penetrates through the full thickness of the hide. Workers periodically cut a cross-section of a hide and observe the degree of penetration. Once the process achieves even penetration, workers slowly raise the float's pH in a process called basification, which fixes the tanning material to the leather—and the more tanning material fixed, the higher the leather's hydrothermal stability and shrinkage temperature resistance. Chrome-tanned leather pH is typically between pH 3.8 and 4.2.|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} {{deals with}} the treatment of spent <b>tanning</b> <b>liquor</b> using the chromium cake from alkali enzymatic hydrolysis of leather shavings, the scheme {{is seen as a}} part of complete recycling of chromium in the leather industry. There is a long-term worldwide effort to keep all chromium under control, ideally in a closed loop, since chromium, especially in its hexavalent form, has a negative impact on the environment and human health. The filtration cake obtained by hydrolysis contains a significant amount of chromium and, due to its alkaline character it could be used for the treatment of spent <b>tanning</b> <b>liquor.</b> The work demonstrates that total dechroming of spent <b>tanning</b> <b>liquor</b> is possible. The efficiency of the process depends on the weight ratio between chromium cake and spent <b>tanning</b> <b>liquor</b> and on the retention time. Using a ratio of 0. 3 and a retention time of 1 hour, the dechroming level achieved was 81. 6 %; for a ratio of 1, the dechroming reached up to 98. 3 %. Using the former ratio, the dechroming level increased to 94. 1 % after 6 hours. The treatment process has some limitations the feed composition {{plays an important role in}} the process setup to achieve the high dechroming level...|$|E

40|$|The {{processing}} of heavy leather employs the vegetable tanning method involving use of <b>tan</b> <b>liquor.</b> The solid residue of this vegetable tanning process aggravates the water pollution {{by means of}} leaching of tannin and other associatedpollutants. Tannin is a biologically resistant compound causing several problems in animal body. The present study dealt with the pollution hazard arising out of leaching of pollutants from the open dumped vegetable tanning residue by rainfall washing. The concerned pollutants were pH, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), tannin,sulfate and chloride concentration. To explore the possible extent of contamination of these pollutants in the leached water, two different masses (2 kg and 3 kg) of tanning residue were employed. The {{results of the study}} showed that there was a continuous release of pollutants from the vegetable tanning residue. Moreover, there was no regular variation in various pollutant concentrations in both the cases solely due to non-homogeneity of the residue...|$|R

40|$|Příspěvek se týká zpracování tuhých a kapalných odpadů z koželužské výroby. Hlavním kritériem byly matematické modely platné pro procesy v koželužství. Navržené modely byly využity při optimalizaci první "mokré" koželužské operace - námoku surových kůží v koželužské výrobě, která se vyznačuje velkou spotřebou užitkové vody a chemikálií. Pro stanovení cílové funkce bylo zvoleno ekonomické hledisko, tj. nákladová funkce. Even {{though the}} leather {{industry}} is environmentally {{important as a}} user of a byproduct of the meat industry, it is still perceived as a consumer of resources and a producer of pollutants. When processing one metric ton of rawhide, 200 kg of a leather-final product is obtained, and only 20 % of the raw material weight is converted to leather. The biggest problem, {{and one that is}} now under scrutiny, is the disposition of chrome-tanned solid wastes. To keep the chromium from tanned wastes within control limits we have worked out a modified enzymatic dechromation technology and developed it into an industrial scale with a daily capacity of three metric tons of chrome shavings. The chromium-containing sludge, isolated by this technology, contains 10 - 15 % magnesium oxide, and is used (here) as a precipitator for chromium in spent <b>tanning</b> <b>liquor.</b> We treated a spent liquor containing 2294 ppm of chromium with the chromium sludge, obtained from the enzymatic reaction. After the treatment, the content of chromium decreased from the original 2294 ppm to 6 ppm, which means that practically total dechromation of the waste chrome water has occurred. This chrome removal from the spent <b>tanning</b> <b>liquor,</b> using the chrome sludge from digestion of the chrome-tanned solid wastes, effectively provides a closed loop for chromium in tanning operations...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was concerned with}} the concentration of residual chromium <b>tanning</b> <b>liquor</b> by evaporative techniques and the re-use of this concentrated chromium liquor for tannage after adjustment with a makeup of basic chromium sulphate powder. Twelve samples of the residual chromium liquors were collected randomly from ALNASR and the White Nile Tanneries. They were analysed mainly for Cr 2 o 3 content, concentration of neutral salts (0 Be) and (PH). The average quantity of chromium oxide "Cr 2 o 3 " for both tanneries which discharged as waste to the drain {{was found to be}} 5. 58 g/L. This quantity is equivalent to 32 % of the chromic oxide added {{at the beginning of the}} tannage. This mean, that more or less one third of the basic chromium sulphate used in tannage is lost as waste. Then two Evaporation experiments were carried out at the White Nile Tannery laboratory by direct heating to determine the optimum evaporation level for maximum chromium oxide recovery. This level of evaporation was found to be about 27 % of the water, can be evaporated without much loss of chromium oxide. Then Eight tanning Experiments were carried out at the White Nile Tannery pilot plant in the following manner:- A residual chrome liquor (R 1) was taken from the White Nile tannery and it was evaporated to the required level (C 1). Then the chromium oxide in (C 1) was determined and was adjusted with fresh chromium powder to maintain the tanning percentage to 7 %. Then it was used to tan a delimed, bated, pickled pelt. The residual liquor(R 2) from (C 1) was again evaporated to (C 2). Then the chromium oxide in (C 2) was determined and adjusted to the required level with fresh chromium powder. Then it was used to tan a delimed, bated, pickled pelt. This process was repeated eight times untill (C 8) and (R 9). The average quantity of basic chromium sulphate required to be added as a make-up was found to be 4. 9 %. That means 2. 1 % of basic chromium sulphate is saved all through the year, in addition to the following savings:- 1) 4 % in the sodium chloride 2) 60 - 70 % in the water 3) 0. 1 - 0. 2 % in the sulphuric Acid Then four pelts tanned with (C 8), (C 7), (C 6) plus one side from the White Nile Tannery were retanned as usual and they were paste- Dried. Then they were tested for their physical and chemical properties and the results obtained were found to be within the accepted international limits. The economical evaluation of the project was found to be feasible. The annual profit was found to be 33767 US$ and the pay-back period was found to be about 1. 3 year. As with regard to the environmental evaluation and since the process is a closed loop process, then appendix (5) proves that the salinity will be reduced by 25 %, the toxicity by 24 %, the B. O. D by 1. 2 % and the C. O. D by 1 %, from the total pollution load of the tannery. Hence this process is an eco-friendly process, in addition to the reduction in cost of the end of pipe treatment...|$|E
