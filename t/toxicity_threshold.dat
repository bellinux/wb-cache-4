The hypothesis suggests that the compulsory consumption of both the nutrients and neurotoxins in plants selected for a system capable of maximizing the benefits of plant energy extraction while mitigating the cost of plant toxicity. To do this, humans evolved a defense system in which plant consumption is mediated by cues of toxicity in a manner sensitive to the individual’s <b>toxicity</b> <b>threshold,</b> maintaining blood toxin concentrations below a critical level.|$|E
5000|$|Marginal {{prevention}} costs of toxic emissions {{are derived from}} the so-called prevention curve as depicted in Figure 2. The basic idea behind such a curve is that a country (or a group of countries, such as the European Union), must take prevention measures to reduce toxic emissions (more than one measure is required to reach the target). From {{the point of view}} of the economy, the cheapest measures (in terms of euro/kg) are taken first. At a certain point at the curve, the reduction of the emissions is sufficient to bring the concentration of the pollution below the so-called no-effect-level. The no-effect-level of [...] emissions is the level that the emissions and the natural absorption of the earth are in equilibrium again at a maximum temperature rise of 2 degrees C. The no-effect-level of a toxic emission is the level where the concentration in nature is well below the <b>toxicity</b> <b>threshold</b> (most natural toxic substances have a <b>toxicity</b> <b>threshold,</b> below which they might even have a beneficial effect), or below the background level. For human toxicity the 'no-observed-adverse-effect level' is used.The eco-costs are the marginal {{prevention costs}} of the last measure of the prevention curve to reach the no-effect-level. See the abovementioned references 4 and 8 for a full description of the calculation method (note that in the calculation 'classes' of emissions with the same ‘midpoint’ are combined, as explained below).|$|E

PolyQ length only influences the aggregation kinetics and, to a lesser extent, the stability of the aggregates. We thus propose that polyQ toxicity does not depend on a structural transition occurring above a specific threshold, but rather that polyQ tracts are inherently toxic sequences, whose deleterious effect gradually increases with their length.

The metal concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry. The mean (± standard deviation) concentrations and range of cobalt, chromium, nickel and cadmium in the battery electrodes were 361284 ± 32281 mg/kg (range 20870 - 575330 mg/kg); 25. 3 ± 4. 6 mg/kg (7. 9 - 149 mg/kg); 75272 ± 14630 mg/kg (3589 - 266607 mg/kg) and 2. 8 ± 0. 6 mg/kg (0. 2 - 16. 3 mg/kg), respectively. Similarly, the mean values of cobalt, chromium, nickel and cadmium in the PWB were 564 ± 165 mg/kg (56. 1 - 4068 mg/kg); 28. 1 ± 4. 0 mg/kg (ND- 97. 2 mg/kg); 735 ± 188 mg/kg (22. 7 - 2727 mg/kg) and 1. 8 ± 0. 3 mg/kg (ND- 7. 2 mg/kg), respectively. The Li-ion battery electrodes contained {{significantly higher levels of}} cobalt (p < 0. 01) whereas, the NiMH battery contained significantly higher nickel (P < 0. 01).

This is in apparent contradiction with our recent findings that extrasynaptic NMDA receptor signaling exerts a dominant inhibitory effect on prosurvival signaling from synaptic NMDA receptors. Here {{we report that}} exposure to low preconditioning doses of NMDA results in preferential activation of synaptic NMDA receptors because of {{a dramatic increase in}} action potential firing. Both acute and long-lasting phases of neuroprotection in the face of apoptotic or excitotoxic insults are dependent on this firing enhancement. Key mediators of synaptic NMDA receptor-dependent neuroprotection, phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-Akt (PI 3 kinase-Akt) signaling to Forkhead box subgroup O (FOXO) export and glycogen synthase kinase 3 β (GSK 3 β) inhibition and cAMP response element-binding protein-dependent (CREB-dependent) activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), can be induced only by low doses of NMDA via this action potential-dependent route. In contrast, NMDA doses {{on the other side of}} the <b>toxicity</b> <b>threshold</b> do not favor synaptic NMDA receptor activation because they strongly suppress firing rates below baseline. The classic bell-shaped curve depicting neuronal fate in response to NMDA dose can be viewed as the net effect of two antagonizing (synaptic vs extrasynaptic) curves: via increased firing the synaptic signaling dominates at low doses, whereas firing becomes suppressed and extrasynaptic signaling dominates as the <b>toxicity</b> <b>threshold</b> is crossed...|$|E

Nonspecific damage outpaced inactivation of toluene 2 -monooxygenase in B. cepacia G 4 cells. Cells that had degraded approximately 0. 5 μmol of TCE (mg of cells− 1) lost 95 % of their acetate-dependent O 2 uptake activity (a measure of general respiratory activity), yet toluene-dependent O 2 uptake activity decreased only 35 %. Cell culturability also decreased upon TCE oxidation; however, the extent of loss varied greatly (up to 3 orders of magnitude) with the method of assessment. Addition of catalase or sodium pyruvate to the surfaces of agar plates increased enumeration of TCE-injured cells {{by as much as}} 100 -fold, indicating that the TCE-injured cells were ultrasensitive to oxidative stress. Cell suspensions that had oxidized TCE recovered the ability to grow in liquid minimal medium containing lactate or phenol, but recovery was delayed substantially when TCE degradation approached 0. 5 μmol (mg of cells− 1) or 66 % of the cells' transformation capacity for TCE at the cell density utilized. Furthermore, among B. cepacia G 4 cells isolated on Luria-Bertani agar plates from cultures that had degraded approximately 0. 5 μmol of TCE (mg of cells− 1), up to 90 % were Tol− variants, no longer capable of TCE degradation.

Soil pH had no significant effect on soil total Zn <b>toxicity</b> <b>thresholds,</b> whereas significant positive correlations were found between these thresholds and background Zn for the PNR and SIR test (r = 0. 74 and 0. 71, respectively; log-log correlations). No such trend was found for the MRR test. Soil solution–based thresholds showed highly significant negative correlations with soil pH for all assays that might be explained by competition of H+ for binding sites, as demonstrated for aquatic species. The microbial assays were also applied to soils collected under galvanized pylons (three sites) where concentrations of total Zn were up to 2, 100 to 3, 700 mg Zn/kg. Correlations between concentrations of total Zn and microbial responses were insignificant at all sites even though spiking reference samples to equivalent concentrations reduced microbial activities {{up to more than}} 10 -fold. Differences in response between spiked and field soils are partly but not completely attributed to the large differences in concentrations of Zn in soil solution.

However, various screening exercises performed on large sets of chemicals indicate {{that the number of}} substances fulfilling the screening criteria defined in Annex D of the Stockholm Convention might be much higher. Most of these screening studies searched for highly persistent and bioaccumulative chemicals, but did not include the long-range transport potential, which is a key criterion under the Stockholm Convention. We apply the screening criteria for persistence, bioaccumulation and long-range transport potential of the Stockholm Convention to a set of 93 144 organic chemicals. Because no <b>toxicity</b> <b>threshold</b> is defined under the Stockholm Convention, we use the <b>toxicity</b> <b>threshold</b> of REACH, the chemicals regulation of the European Union. For {{the vast majority of the}} chemicals, the property data required for the assessment had to be estimated from the chemical structure. Assessment results for the acknowledged POPs and for POP candidates currently under review are discussed. Beyond these well-known substances, we find 510 chemicals that exceed all four critieria and can be considered potential POPs. Ninety eight percent of these chemicals are halogenated; frequent types of chemicals are halogenated aromatic compounds, including polychlorinated diphenylethers, tetrachloro benzyltoluenes, brominated and fluorinated naphthalenes and biphenyls; and highly or fully chlorinated and fluorinated alkanes (cyclic, linear, branched). Non-halogenated substances are highly branched alkanes and nitroaromatic compounds. Ten substances are high-production volume chemicals and 249 are pre-registered in the EU. We used uncertainty ranges of the chemical property data to estimate a lower and upper bound of the number of potential POPs; these bounds are at 190 and 1 200 chemicals. These results imply that several tens of potential POPs may have to be expected for future evaluation under the Stockholm Convention...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The {{exposure}} {{of children to}} lead has decreased in recent years, thanks notably to the banning of leaded gasoline. However, lead exposure remains {{a matter of public}} health concern, because no <b>toxicity</b> <b>threshold</b> has been observed, cognitive effects having been demonstrated even at low levels. It is therefore important to update exposure assessments. A national study was conducted, in 2008 - 2009, to determine the blood lead level (BLL) distribution in {{children between the ages of}} six months and six years in France. We also assessed the contribution of environmental factors. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey included 3831 children recruited at hospitals. Two-stage probability sampling was carried out, with stratification by hospital and French region. Sociodemographic characteristics were recorded, and blood samples and environmental data were collected by questionnaire. Generalized linear model and quantile regression were used to quantify the association between BLL and environmental risk factors. RESULTS: The geometric mean BLL was 14. 9 μg/l (95 % confidence interval (CI) =[14. 5 - 15. 4]) and 0. 09 % of the children (95 % CI=[0. 03 - 0. 15]) had BLLs exceeding 100 μg/l, 1. 5 % (95 % CI=[0. 9 - 2. 1] exceeding 50 μg/l. Only slight differences were observed between French regions. Environmental factors significantly associated with BLL were the consumption of tap water in homes with lead service connections, peeling paint or recent renovations in old housing, hand-mouth behavior, passive smoking and having a mother born in a country where lead is often used. CONCLUSIONS: In children between the ages of one and six years in France, lead exposure has decreased over the last 15 years as in the US and other European countries.

40|$|An {{extensive}} testing programme on {{the toxicity}} of sodium molybdate dihydrate in soil was initiated {{to comply with}} the European REACH Regulation. The molybdate toxicity was assayed with 11 different bioassays, 10 different soils, soil chemical studies on aging reactions, and toxicity tests before and after 1 -year equilibration in field conditions. Differences in molybdate toxicity among soils were best explained by soil pH and clay content. A correction factor of 2. 0 was selected to account for the difference in molybdate toxicity between laboratory and field conditions due to leaching and aging processes. <b>Toxicity</b> <b>thresholds</b> were determined as the H...|$|R
40|$|Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), the {{representative}} perfluorinated surfactant, is an anthropogenic pollutant detected in various environmental matrices. Little is known regarding its safe thresholds to the aquatic ecosystem. Predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) for PFOA were derived {{based on the}} measured/predicted chronic/acute toxicity data. The interspecies correlation estimation (ICE) program and final acute-to-chronic ratio (FACR) were applied to investigate their capability for the derivation of PNEC. The recommended aquatic <b>toxicity</b> <b>thresholds</b> for PFOA {{are in the range}} of 0. 30 ～ 8. 48 mg/L. The ICE-based species sensitivity distribution (SSD) method has certain potential for the derivation of PNEC especially when toxicity data are limited. ? 2011 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{a model for}} drug delivery optimisation in a chronotherapeu-tics framework. We present a pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics model for oxaliplatin and 5 -Fluorouracil, a classic therapeutic association {{in the treatment of}} colorectal cancer. We derive the phar-macokinetics model using law of mass action and enzyme kinetics. We design an age-structured cell cycle PDE model with drug damage and repair phases to account for the effect of the drugs on proliferating cell populations, with different parameters for healthy and cancerous cells. Our goal is to minimise the growth rate of cancerous cells while maintaining the growth rate of healthy cells above a given <b>toxicity</b> <b>threshold.</b> We numerically optimise the drug delivery schedules under our model and obtain theoretically efficient infusion schemes in a chronotherapeutics framework...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{application}} of foliar fungicides in vineyards and orchards can increase soil concentration of heavy metals such as copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), {{up to the}} <b>toxicity</b> <b>threshold</b> for fruit trees and cover crops. However, some agronomic practices, such as liming, addition of organic fertilizers, cultivation of soil cover crops and inoculation of young plants with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can decrease the availability and the potential of heavy metal toxicity to fruit trees. This review aims to compile and present information {{about the effects of}} increasing concentrations of heavy metals, especially Cu and Zn, on soils cultivated with fruit trees and provides some agronomic practices of remediation. Information about the sources of heavy metals found in soils cultivated with fruit trees are presented; mechanisms of absorption, transport, accumulation and potential toxicity to plants are described...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Mercury (Hg) is {{a global}} {{contaminant}} of aquatic food chains. Aquatic birds, such as the osprey (Pandion haliaetus), with migratory populations breeding in Canada and the northern United States and wintering in the Central and South America, can be exposed to mercury on both the breeding and wintering ranges. We examined Hg levels in 14 fish taxa from 24 osprey wintering sites identified from satellite telemetry. Our main goal {{was to determine whether}} fish species that feature in the diet of overwintering and resident fish-eating birds reached toxi-city thresholds for Hg. Mean Hg levels in fish whole car-casses ranged from a high of 0. 18 lg g- 1 (wet weight) in Scomberomorus sierra to a low of 0. 009 lg g- 1 in Catostomidae. Average Hg levels were within published <b>toxicity</b> <b>threshold</b> values in forage fish for only two sites i...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{technical}} memorandum {{is to provide a}} summary and documentation of the Science Panel’s discussions relative to <b>toxicity</b> <b>thresholds</b> for exposure of birds to selenium at the Great Salt Lake. It is generally recognized that the most significant exposure of birds occurs through their diet, and that the best-documented and most readily-monitored effects are those on reproductive success (particularly egg hatchability). Thus, much of the focus of this technical memorandum is on those exposures and endpoints, because they can be most readily applied toward establishment of a site-specific water quality standard for selenium in the open waters of the Great Salt Lake...|$|R
40|$|For land-use planning, French acute <b>toxicity</b> <b>thresholds</b> are {{developed}} {{based on a}} methodology. This method proposes an exhaustive review of acute toxicological data {{and is based on}} expert judgment. Currently, the incapacitating effects are not taken into account in this methodology when setting thresholds. Generally, incapacitating effects are reversible effects but they could prevent the escape or affect the performance of a task. These effects can lead to prolonged exposure to the toxic substance and thus may cause irreversible or even lethal effect. Most of the international agencies (U. S. EPA, AIHA, [...] .) take into account the incapacitating effects in determining acute <b>toxicity</b> <b>thresholds</b> for emergency. Incapacitating effects can be classified according to their nature (physical, chemical), specificity (local, systemic) and severity. Several options were discussed for the inclusion of this type of effects in the French methodology. First, the definition of the threshold of irreversible effects could be revised to include incapacity. Or a specific paragraph could alert about the possible occurrence of incapacitating effects. Finally, a specific threshold could be developed, intermediate between reversible and irreversible thresholds. Different chemicals were used as case studies to test the different hypotheses. The substances of concern were chlorine, hydrogen fluoride and tetrachloroethylene. As example for tetrachloroethylene, incapacitating effect thresholds has been developed and shown that the third hypothesis seems the most acceptable. Indeed, a threshold of incapacitating effect for tetrachloroethylene is proposed at 250 ppm regardless of the exposure time, based on dizziness and incoordination. This threshold is currently under review...|$|R
30|$|A {{different}} approach to activity prescription from the homogenous, single compartment models of the BSA and MIRD mono-compartment methods is the partition model (PM). It postulates three compartments with potentially different activity uptakes: tumor, normal liver, and lung tissue [18]. As such, it allows for {{the selection of a}} prescribed activity that maximizes the absorbed dose to the tumor tissue, while not exceeding <b>toxicity</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the other two compartments. The expected activities in each compartment are usually based on the distribution of 99 mTc-MAA on the safety scan. However, there is some discussion in the literature about the predictive value of these particles for the subsequent 90 Y microsphere distribution [34 – 37].|$|R
