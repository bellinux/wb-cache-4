5|$|The {{contact angle}} (θ), {{as seen in}} Figure 1, is the angle at which the liquid–vapor {{interface}} meets the solid-liquid interface. The contact angle {{is determined by the}} result between adhesive and cohesive forces. As the tendency of a drop <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> over a flat, solid surface increases, the contact angle decreases. Thus, the contact angle provides an inverse measure of wettability.|$|E
5|$|The {{first season}} was {{produced}} by the ABC Studios in association with The Mark Gordon Company and Random Acts Productions. Safran, Gordon, Robert Sertner, Nicholas Pepper and Jake Coburn served as the executive producers. The show was designed to have a flashback narrative, shifting between two timelines. Safran incorporated the flashforward storytelling technique as he thought it allowed them <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> the plot points.|$|E

5|$|As the Dorniers passed Sheerness, the {{anti-aircraft}} defences opened fire {{to protect the}} naval yard at Chatham, Kent. Along the south bank of the Thames Estuary 15 gun positions fired six 4.5in of 3.7in heavy shells. The German bombers opened up a little, <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>out.</b> The cloud over the target ruined the German bomb run, and some bombers began the return trip with their loads still on board. While crossing the coast over Deal, Kent, three attacked the Royal Marines barracks there. They continued back across the Channel, having made no contact with enemy fighters.|$|E
5|$|As {{the number}} of {{expected}} participants grew, the rally was moved from {{the grounds of the}} Washington Monument to the east end of the Mall facing the Capitol. The stage was {{on the east side of}} the rally with an open back, allowing the Capitol building to provide the backdrop for the performances. In order to meet the public safety requirements of the National Park Service permit, the Mall between the Capitol and 14th Street was divided into sections, with access aisles lined by portable fences. Speakers and jumbotron television screens were placed along both the north and south edges to encourage the crowd <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> rather than press against the main stage.|$|E
5|$|The band {{initially}} {{planned to}} record their debut album {{in the space of}} two weeks. However, tours and other live performances caused the recording <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> between September 1999 and April–May 2000. The album was recorded at Rockfield Studios, Matrix Studios, and Wessex Sound Studios with producer Ken Nelson, although the majority of Parachutes' tracks were recorded at Liverpool's Parr Street Studios (where they accessed three studio rooms). The mixing process on all songs for the album was done by American engineer Michael Brauer in New York. During that period, they played on the Carling Tour, which showcased up-and-coming acts.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mature}} {{stage of a}} thunderstorm, the warmed air {{continues}} to rise until it reaches an area of warmer air and can rise no farther. Often this 'cap' is the tropopause. The air is instead forced <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>out,</b> giving the storm a characteristic anvil shape. The resulting cloud is called cumulonimbus incus. The water droplets coalesce into larger and heavier droplets and freeze to become ice particles. As these fall, they melt to become rain. If the updraft is strong enough, the droplets are held aloft long enough to become so large {{that they do not}} melt completely but fall as hail. While updrafts are still present, the falling rain drags the surrounding air with it, creating downdrafts as well. The simultaneous presence of both an updraft and a downdraft marks the mature stage of the storm and produces cumulonimbus clouds. During this stage, considerable internal turbulence can occur within, which manifests as strong winds, severe lightning, and even tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Islam {{then started}} <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> of Mindanao {{in the south}} and went into Luzon in the north. Manila in Luzon was Islamized during the reign of Sultan Bolkiah in 1485 to 1521. This was {{accomplished}} because the Sultanate of Brunei subjugated Tondo by defeating Rajah Gambang in battle and thereafter installing the Muslim rajah, Rajah Salalila to the throne and by establishing the Bruneian puppet-state of the Rajahnate of Maynila. Sultan Bolkiah also married Laila Mecana, the daughter of Sulu Sultan Amir Ul-Ombra to expand Brunei's influence in both Luzon and Mindanao. The Muslims then proceeded to wage wars and conduct slave-raids against the Visayans. Participating in the Muslim raids, the Sultanate of Ternate consequently destroyed the Kedatuan of Dapitan in Bohol. The Rajahnates of Butuan and Cebu also endured slave raids from, and waged wars against the Sultanate of Maguindanao.|$|E
5|$|Plans for the {{expansion}} northwards from the city center to Åsane involve either building the system to replace many of the local buses operating in Sandviken, or make the light rail line an express service. If the latter is chosen, the line will bypass Bryggen in a tunnel and make few stops before Åsane. An important stop mid-way is the Norwegian School of Economics. The terminus will probably be Åsane Senter or Nyborg; the former shopping center has set aside areas for a station. At Åsane, a major bus terminal would allow connections to the northern parts of Bergen, suburbs further north and areas in Nordhordland. An important political argument for prioritizing this line is <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> the investments to {{all parts of the}} city, since the line is being financed by taxpayers and car-users throughout the city.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, Cahn {{published}} a simple mathematical {{treatment of the}} thermodynamics of wetting: the interaction between a liquid in contact with a solid surface. This paper laid out a simple formulation for describing the wetting transition—the point at which a liquid changes from forming a droplet on a surface <b>to</b> <b>spreading</b> <b>out</b> evenly as a liquid film over the surface. This theory had wide-ranging implications for many materials processing techniques.|$|R

5|$|The {{setting of}} the game {{takes place in the}} 24th century when {{humanity}} has discovered interstellar travel through the use of interstellar subspace jump nodes that function {{in the same manner as}} wormholes, allowing it <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> across the stars and colonise new worlds. Prior to the game beginning, humanity (referred to as Terrans) formed the Galactic Terran Alliance (GTA) as the central power of all of their systems' governments and military, and became engaged in a war over systems and resources against the Vasudans of the Parliamentary Vasudan Empire (PVE). By the time the story begins, this war has entered its fourteenth year, as a third species, dubbed Shivans, makes an unprovoked attack on the Terran system of Ross 128. The player, acting as a new Terran pilot in the GTA, is initially involved in the conflict with the PVE before the fights focus on the new species' arrival and subsequent assaults.|$|E
5|$|The {{top three}} began <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> {{in the second}} half of the race, and by lap 54 Lewis Hamilton was leading Rosberg by 10.06 seconds, with Vettel a further 12.12 seconds behind Rosberg. However, due to Ferrari's earlier attempt to {{undercut}} Rosberg by pitting Vettel early, Räikkönen's tyres were 4 laps fresher than his teammate's, and he closed in on Vettel over the final stint. Having emerged from his final pit stop 4.84 seconds behind Vettel on lap 35, Räikkönen had closed the gap to 1.37 seconds by lap 54. However, the chance of a battle between the Ferrari teammates was extinguished after a transmission failure on Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso, who was stranded on the start/finish-straight, brought out the safety car for the final two laps, meaning that the race ended under safety car conditions.|$|E
5|$|During the Swedish {{emigration}} to the United States in the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, about 1.3million Swedes left Sweden for the United States. The main pull was {{the availability of}} low cost, high quality farm land in the upper Midwest (the area from Illinois to Montana), and high paying jobs in mechanical industries and factories in Chicago, Minneapolis, Worcester and many smaller cities. Religious freedom was also a pull factor for some. Most migration was of the chain form, with early settlers giving reports and recommendations (and travel money) to relatives and friends in Sweden, who followed the same route to new homes. A major push factor inside Sweden was population growth and the growing shortage of good farm lands. Additional factors in the earliest stages of emigration included crop failures, the lack of industrial jobs in urban Sweden, and for some the wish to escape the authority of an established state church. After 1870, transatlantic fares were cheap. By the 1880s, American railroads had agents in Sweden who offered package deals on one-way tickets for entire families. The railroad would ship the family, their house furnishings and farm tools, and provide a financial deal <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> payments for the farm {{over a period of}} years.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 1962 and {{continuing}} over the next few years, members of the PDP-1 programming community at MIT, including Russell and the other Hingham Institute members, began <b>to</b> <b>spread</b> <b>out</b> to other schools and employers such as Stanford University and DEC, and as they did they spread the game to other universities and institutions with a PDP-1 computer. As a result, Spacewar was perhaps the first video game to be available outside a single research institute. Over the next decade, programmers at these other institutions began coding their own variants, including features such as allowing more ships and players at once, replacing the hyperspace feature with a cloaking device, space mines, and even a first-person perspective version played on two screens that simulates each pilot's view out of the cockpit. Some of these Spacewar installations also replicated Kotok and Saunders' gamepad. According to a second-hand account heard by Russell while working at DEC, Spacewar was reportedly used as a smoke test by DEC technicians on new PDP-1 systems before shipping {{because it was the only}} available program that exercised every aspect of the hardware. Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at US$120,000 and only 55 were ever sold, most without a monitor and many of the remainder to secure military locations or research labs with no free computer time, which prevented the original Spacewar from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience. Though some later DEC models, such as the PDP-6, came with Spacewar pre-loaded, the audience for the game remained very limited; the PDP-6, for example, sold only 23 units.|$|E
