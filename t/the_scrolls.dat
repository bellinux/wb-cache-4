5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Greece {{almost all the}} Jews of Rhodes {{were sent to the}} Auschwitz concentration camp; as a result, most members of Etz Ahayem had close family members who were killed in the Holocaust. Before the occupation, however, members of the Kal Grande congregation in Rhodes had buried their Torah scrolls. After the war <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> were retrieved and sent to Israel, and a Dr. Nace Cohen was able to procure one of them for Etz Ahayem.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Hurricane Katrina and the {{subsequent}} 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans, the congregation's building at 7000 Canal Boulevard filled with at least ten feet of water, and Beth Israel garnered national attention after {{attempts were made to}} save its Torah scrolls. Beth Israel's rabbi, Yisroel Shiff, who had evacuated to Tennessee before Katrina hit, contacted Rabbi Isaac Leider, who had worked on ZAKA search-and-rescue teams in Israel for five years. After contacting federal officials and the Louisiana National Guard, Leider hired a helicopter to fly him to within a mile of Beth Israel, met with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) search-and-rescue team appointed to retrieve <b>the</b> <b>scrolls.</b> The group used rubber rafts to reach Beth Israel and enter it, where Leider waded into the sanctuary and rescued the Torah scrolls and their silver ornaments.|$|E
2500|$|Józef Milik {{proposed}} that <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> was written around 100 CE, nearly a [...] "generation after {{the destruction of}} Jerusalem." [...] If Milik's dating of <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> is correct, it would mean that <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> {{did not come from}} the Qumran community because his dating puts <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> [...] "well after the Qumran settlement was destroyed." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Considering the leakage {{and heat}} transfer, the {{mathematical}} model of <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> compressor/expander module (CEM) {{used in the}} automotive fuel cell systems is developed based on thermodynamics theory. The performance of <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> CEM is simulated at different rotation speed, operating pressure, inlet temperature, and so on. The simulated {{results show that the}} power consumed by <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> CEM is about 50 per cent of that of just <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> compressor. However, for different operating pressures, the consumed power of <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> CEM has <b>the</b> least value at the design point. The power consumed by <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> CEM decreases about 4. 5 per cent when the inlet temperature rises from 0 to 35 °C. The flowrate of dry air increases with the rise of <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> CEM rotation speed. Moreover, it decreases 11. 4 per cent when <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> CEM inlet temperature changes from 0 to 35 °C...|$|R

5|$|Hanging scroll: Hanging scrolls {{originated}} in their earliest form from literature and other texts written on bamboo strips and silk banners in ancient China. The earliest hanging scrolls {{are related to}} and developed from silk banners in early Chinese history. These banners were long and hung vertically on walls. Such silk banners and hanging scroll paintings were found at Mawangdui {{dating back to the}} Han Dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). By the time of the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the aesthetic and structural objectives for hanging scrolls were summarized, which are still followed to this day. During the early Song Dynasty (960–1279), <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> became well suited to the art styles of the artists, consequently hanging scrolls were made in many different sizes and proportions.|$|E
25|$|Often, one of <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> is fixed, {{while the}} other orbits {{eccentrically}} without rotating, thereby trapping and pumping or compressing pockets of fluid between <b>the</b> <b>scrolls.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} entrances to the Ark where <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> of the Torah {{are stored in}} special holders. <b>The</b> <b>scrolls</b> are {{handwritten}} on a single continuous piece of parchment.|$|E
25|$|Scrolls can {{be rolled}} {{in one of}} two ways. The first method is to wrap <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> around a single core, similar to a modern roll of paper towels. While simple to construct, a single core scroll has a major disadvantage: in order to read text at the end of <b>the</b> <b>scroll,</b> <b>the</b> entire <b>scroll</b> must be unwound. This is {{partially}} overcome in the second method, which is to wrap <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> around two cores, as in a Torah. With a double <b>scroll,</b> <b>the</b> text can be accessed from both beginning and end, and the portions of <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> not being read can remain wound. This still leaves <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> a sequential-access medium: to reach a given page, one generally has to unroll and re-roll many other pages.|$|R
50|$|The codex {{began to}} replace <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> {{almost as soon}} as it was invented. In Egypt, by the fifth century, the codex outnumbered <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> by ten to one based on {{surviving}} examples. By the sixth century, <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> had almost vanished as a medium for literature.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>scroll</b> {{was made}} by one person only. Most of the {{patterns}} were drawn on two pieces of parchment that were put together, and then pasted on <b>the</b> <b>scroll.</b> <b>The</b> placement of the patterns on <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> is somewhat disorganized. Patterns of similar themes are fallen apart, and some patterns formed on two parchment pieces are combined imperfectly.|$|R
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> were the product of Jews living in Jerusalem, who hid <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> in the caves near Qumran while fleeing from the Romans during the destruction of Jerusalem in 70CE. Karl Heinrich Rengstorf first proposed that the Dead Sea Scrolls originated at the library of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem. Later, Norman Golb suggested that <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> were the product of multiple libraries in Jerusalem, and not necessarily the Jerusalem Temple library. Proponents of the Jerusalem Origin theory point to the diversity of thought and handwriting among <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> as evidence against a Qumran origin of <b>the</b> <b>scrolls.</b> Several archaeologists have also accepted an origin of <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> other than Qumran, including Yizhar Hirschfeld and most recently Yizhak Magen and Yuval Peleg, who all understand the remains of Qumran to be those of a Hasmonean fort that was reused during later periods.|$|E
25|$|Archeologists {{have long}} {{associated}} <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> with the ancient Jewish sect called the Essenes, although some recent interpretations have challenged this connection {{and argue that}} priests in Jerusalem, or Zadokites, or other unknown Jewish groups wrote <b>the</b> <b>scrolls.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>scrolls</b> were {{analyzed}} using a cyclotron at the University of California, Davis, where {{it was found that}} all black ink was carbon black. The red ink on <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> was found to be made with cinnabar (HgS, mercury sulfide). There are only four uses of this red ink in the entire collection of Dead Sea Scroll fragments. The black inks found on <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> that are made up of carbon soot were found to be from olive oil lamps. Honey, oil, vinegar, and water were often added to the mixture to thin the ink to a proper consistency for writing. In order to apply the ink to <b>the</b> <b>scrolls,</b> its writers used reed pens.|$|E
50|$|When <b>the</b> Torah <b>scroll</b> {{is placed}} on the bimah, or reading table, the baal keriah {{approaches}} the bimah by the most direct route possible and stands in front of <b>the</b> <b>scroll,</b> a little to the left. If necessary, <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> is rolled to the portion to be read, and then closed and covered with the mantle. To the left side of <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> stands <b>the</b> gabbai, who calls up congregants to honor them with an aliyah. To the right of <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> stands <b>the</b> second gabbai, the gabbai sheini.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> is a thin wooden bar, called tiangan (天杆), {{on which}} a cord is {{attached}} for hanging <b>the</b> <b>scroll.</b> [...] Two decorative strips, called jingyan (惊燕; literally [...] "frighten swallows"), are sometimes attached {{to the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>scroll.</b> At <b>the</b> bottom of <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> is a wooden cylindrical bar, called digan (地杆), attached to give <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> <b>the</b> necessary weight to hang properly onto a wall, but it also serves to roll up a scroll for storage when the artwork is not in display. The two knobs at the far ends of the lower wooden bar are called zhoutou (軸頭) and help to ease the rolling of <b>the</b> <b>scroll.</b> These could be ornamented with a variety of materials, such as jade, ivory, or horn.|$|R
50|$|Emaki-mono {{are read}} by exposing an arms-length of <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> at a time, {{from right to}} left, as Japanese is written. It was common {{for there to be}} a written account of the story being {{illustrated}} either at the start of <b>the</b> <b>scroll,</b> or interspersed between the pictures. It is expected that the person viewing <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> will re-roll <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> back in its original form, much as one is supposed to rewind video tape after viewing it.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>scrolls</b> {{were among}} {{hundreds}} of Torah scrolls {{that had been}} disgraced by the Nazis and/or the Lithuanians during World War II. With the negotiated help of the government, Greenwald and others located over three hundred scrolls, including some that were being held {{in the basement of}} a church. They were able to salvage most of <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> for further use. <b>The</b> <b>scrolls</b> that could not be salvaged were buried in an elaborate ceremony attended by visiting Orthodox Jews from around the World and Lithuanian officials.|$|E
25|$|In 1947 the {{original}} seven scrolls {{caught the attention}} of Dr. John C. Trever, of the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR), who compared the script in <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> to that of The Nash Papyrus, the oldest biblical manuscript then known, and found similarities between them. In March the 1948 Arab-Israeli War prompted the move of some of <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> to Beirut, Lebanon, for safekeeping. On 11 April 1948, Millar Burrows, head of the ASOR, announced the discovery of <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> in a general press release.|$|E
25|$|A {{majority}} of the collection from the Qumran caves was acquired by the Palestine Archaeological Museum. The Museum had <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> photographed by Najib Albina, a local Arab photographer trained by Lewis Larsson of the American Colony in Jerusalem, Between 1952 and 1967, Albina documented the five-stage process of the sorting and assembly of <b>the</b> <b>scrolls,</b> done by the curator and staff of the Palestine Archaeological Museum, using infrared photography. Using a process known today as broadband fluorescence infrared photography, or NIR photography, Najib and the team at the Museum produced over 1,750 photographic plates of <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> and fragments. The photographs were taken with <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> laid out on animal skin, using large format film, which caused the text to stand out, making the plates especially useful for assembling fragments. These are the earliest photographs of the museum's collection, which was the most complete {{in the world at}} the time, and they recorded the fragments and scrolls before their further decay in storage, so they are often considered the best recorded copies of <b>the</b> <b>scrolls.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fine {{scrolling}} requires setup {{to define}} <b>the</b> <b>scrolling</b> region. This {{is done by}} setting <b>the</b> Vertical <b>Scroll</b> (VS) modifier bit in sequential Display List instructions. The first Mode line instruction without the VS bit set becomes the end of <b>the</b> <b>scrolling</b> region and {{is used as a}} buffer line to supply the new scan lines to <b>scroll</b> up into <b>the</b> bottom of <b>the</b> <b>scrolling</b> region.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>scrolls</b> {{were also}} adapted into several novels {{published}} by Geijutsuhiroba, {{the first book}} simply compiled <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> into one publication, now out of print.

50|$|The codex {{began to}} replace <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> {{almost as soon}} as it was invented. For example, in Egypt by the fifth century, the codex outnumbered <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> or roll by ten to one based on {{surviving}} examples, and by the sixth century <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> had almost vanished from use as a vehicle for literature. However, in other places <b>the</b> <b>scroll</b> lingered.

25|$|The Dead Sea scrolls {{were written}} on {{parchment}} made of processed animal hide known as vellum (approximately 85.5 – 90.5% of <b>the</b> <b>scrolls),</b> papyrus (estimated at 8.0 – 13.0% of <b>the</b> <b>scrolls),</b> and sheets of bronze composed of about 99.0% copper and 1.0% tin (approximately 1.5% of <b>the</b> <b>scrolls).</b> For those scrolls written on animal hides, scholars with the Israeli Antiquities Authority, {{by use of}} DNA testing for assembly purposes, believe {{that there may be}} a hierarchy in the religious importance of the texts based on which type of animal was used to create the hide. Scrolls written on goat and calf hides are considered by scholars to be more significant in nature, while those written on gazelle or ibex are considered to be less religiously significant in nature.|$|E
25|$|With the {{monetary}} value of <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> rising as their historical significance was made more public, the Bedouins and the ASOR archaeologists accelerated {{their search for}} <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> separately in the same general area of Qumran, which was over 1 kilometer in length. Between 1953 and 1956, Roland de Vaux led four more archaeological expeditions {{in the area to}} uncover scrolls and artifacts.

25|$|The {{content of}} <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> was {{published}} in a 40 volume series by Oxford University Press published between 1955 and 2009 known as Discoveries in the Judaean Desert. In 1952 the Jordanian Department of Antiquities assembled a team of scholars to begin examining, assembling, and translating <b>the</b> <b>scrolls</b> {{with the intent of}} publishing them. The initial publication, assembled by Dominique Barthélemy and Józef Milik, was published as Qumran Cave 1 in 1955.
