60|$|The {{probability}} {{to which}} all the intelligence from my sister has pointed of late {{turns out to be}} a fact. There is an engagement, or almost an engagement, announced between my dear Caroline and M. de la Feste--to Caroline's sublime happiness, and my mother's entire satisfaction; as well as to that of the Marlets. They and my mother seem to know all about the young man--which is more than I do, though a little extended information about him, considering that I am Caroline's elder sister, would not have been amiss. I half feel with my father, who is much surprised, and, I am sure, not altogether satisfied, that he should not have been consulted at all before matters reached such a definite stage, though he is too amiable to say so openly. I don't quite say <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> should have been hindered for the sake of our opinion, if it is a good thing; but the announcement comes very suddenly. It must have been foreseen by my mother for some time that this upshot was probable, and Caroline might have told me more distinctly that M. de la Feste was her lover, instead of alluding so mysteriously to him as only a friend of the Marlets, and lately dropping his name altogether. My father, without exactly objecting to him as a Frenchman, 'wishes he were of English or some other reasonable nationality for one's son-in-law,' but I tell him that the demarcations of races, kingdoms, and creeds, are wearing down every day, that patriotism is a sort of vice, and that the character of the individual is all we need think about in this case. I wonder if, in the event of their marriage, he will continue to live at Versailles, or if he will come to England.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Traditionally it {{has been}} thought that the moral valence of a proposi-tion is, {{strictly}} speaking, irrelevant to whether someone knows that the proposi-tion is true, and thus irrelevant to the truth-value of a knowledge ascription. On this view, it’s no easier to know, for example, that a bad thing will happen than <b>that</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> will happen (other things being equal). But a series of very sur-prising recent experiments suggest that this is actually not how we view know-ledge. On the contrary, people are much more willing to ascribe knowledge of a bad outcome. This {{is known as the}} epistemic side-effect effect (ESEE) and is a specific instance of a widely documented phenomenon, the side-effect effect (a. k. a. “the Knobe effect”), which is the most famous finding in experimental philosophy. In this paper, I report a new series of five experiments on ESEE and in the process accomplish three things. First, I confirm earlier findings on the ef-fect. Second, I show that the effect is virtually unlimited. Third, I introduce a new technique for detecting the effect, which potentially enhances its theoretical sig-nificance. In particular, my findings make it more likely, though they do not en-tail, that the effect genuinely reflects {{the way we think about}} and ascribe know-ledge, rather than being the result of a performance error. 1...|$|E
