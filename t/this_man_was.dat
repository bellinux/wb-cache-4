5|$|Echmarcach mac Ragnaill (died 1064/1065) was a {{dominant}} {{figure in the}} eleventh-century Irish Sea region. At his height, he reigned as king over Dublin, the Isles, and perhaps the Rhinns of Galloway. The precise identity of Echmarcach's father, Ragnall, is uncertain. One possibility is that <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> one of two eleventh-century rulers of Waterford. Another possibility is that Echmarcach's father was an early eleventh-century ruler of the Isles. If any of these identifications are correct, Echmarcach {{may have been a}} member of the Uí Ímair kindred.|$|E

25|$|When the Mughals sent a {{force from}} Delhi {{to curb the}} {{rebellion}} by the Rajput chiefs of Malwa, Dost Mohammad Khan sided with the Rajputs. In the resulting battle, his men fled from the battlefield, leaving him badly wounded and unconscious.

Khan offered the little water remaining in his mushuk (water carrier) to an injured and thirsty Mughal soldier, who was moaning {{to ward off the}} jackals. <b>This</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> Sayyid Hussain Ali Khan Barha, the younger of the Sayyid Brothers.|$|E
25|$|Formerly, {{social status}} was {{attained}} by successful hunters who could provide food and skins. Successful hunters were recognized as leaders {{by members of}} the social group. Although there were no formally recognized leaders, informal leadership was practiced by or in the men who held the title Nukalpiaq ("man in his prime; successful hunter and good provider"). The nukalpiaq, or good provider, was a man of considerable importance in village life. <b>This</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> consulted in any affair of importance affecting the village in general, particularly in determining participation in the Kevgiq and Itruka'ar ceremonies. He was said to be a major contributor to those ceremonies and provider to orphans and widows.|$|E
25|$|It emerges {{that this}} {{messenger}} was formerly a shepherd on Mount Cithaeron, {{and that he}} was given a baby, which the childless Polybus then adopted.

Oedipus asks the chorus if anyone knows who <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was,</b> or where he might be now. They respond that he is the same shepherd who was witness to the murder of Laius, and whom Oedipus had already sent for. Jocasta, who has by now realized the truth, desperately begs Oedipus to stop asking questions, but he refuses and Jocasta runs into the palace.|$|E

25|$|There was {{a single}} witness to these events, a young man taking the air {{on the balcony of}} the Zarate family {{residence}} nearby. <b>This</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> thought to be Pedro de Zarate. He called to his slaves, and together with them he went to investigate the incident. When they arrived, they found the victim dead and the assailants gone. And they discovered that the victim was in fact Viceroy López de Zúñiga y Velasco, apparently returning from a late-night tryst. Zarate was the son of one of the judges of the Audiencia of Lima, and this court was assembled to decide what action to take. The decision was made to move the body to the viceregal palace, and to announce that the viceroy had died of a sudden attack of apoplexy.|$|E
25|$|This is what McDonald thinks, {{but other}} historians such as Seán Duffy {{have taken it}} to refer to Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the {{progenitor}} of Clan Donald. Alex Woolf argued that Donnchadh was probably too old at this stage to have been fighting in Ireland, and suggests that the probable identity of <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> Ruaídhrí mac Raghnaill. Sellar also believes that Donnchadh {{would have been too}} old, and also suggests identifying this man with Ruaidhrí mac Raghnaill. Donnchadh appeared in Scottish sources in 1237, and again, for the last time, in 1244, as one of the magnates whose names were attached to a letter from Alexander II to the Pope. His son Eóghan appears to have been fully in charge of the lordship by 1249, probably indicating that Donnchadh was dead by this point.|$|E
25|$|Wessex, long {{ruled by}} the dynasty of Alfred and Æthelred, {{submitted}} to Cnut late in 1015, as it had to his father two years earlier. At this point Eadric Streona, the Ealdorman of Mercia, deserted Æthelred together with 40 ships and their crews and joined forces with Cnut. Another defector was Thorkell the Tall, a Jomsviking chief who had fought against the Viking invasion of Sweyn Forkbeard, with a pledge of allegiance to the English in 1012—some explanation for this shift of allegiance {{may be found in}} a stanza of the Jómsvíkinga saga that mentions two attacks against Jomsborg's mercenaries while they were in England, with a man known as Henninge, a brother of Thorkell, among their casualties. If the Flateyjarbók is correct that <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> Cnut's childhood mentor, it explains his acceptance of his allegiance—with Jomvikings ultimately in the service of Jomsborg. The 40 ships Eadric came with, often thought to be of the Danelaw were probably Thorkell's.|$|E

25|$|The {{same day}} that Powell arrived in Baltimore, John Surratt and Louis J. Weichmann {{purchased}} a boat at Port Tobacco in Charles County, Maryland. Surratt, and to a much lesser degree Weichmann, were {{members of a group}} led by John Wilkes Booth which planned to kidnap President Abraham Lincoln and spirit him into Virginia, where he could be turned over to Confederate military authorities. The boat was needed to ferry Lincoln across the Potomac River. The two men then traveled to Baltimore on January 21. In testimony for the prosecution in June 1865, Weichmann said that Surratt had $300 which he needed to give to a man in Baltimore. Although Surratt never revealed the man's name, the prosecution at Powell's 1865 trial attempted to show that <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> Lewis Powell. Historian Edward Steers Jr. agrees that it is likely that Surratt met Powell at this time, while historians David Griffin Chandler and Elizabeth Trindal present their meeting at Parr's China Hall store as fact.|$|E
25|$|Some authors {{suggest that}} an angakkuq could be honest in his tricks, {{believing in the}} {{phenomena}} he himself mimicked, moreover, he could consciously cheat and honestly believe at the same time. Knud Rasmussen mentioned Arnaqaoq, a young Netsilik Inuit living in King William Island. He smeared himself {{with the blood of}} a seal or reindeer, telling people that he had a battle with spirits. Rasmussen conjectured that he could honestly believe in this spirit battle experience which he mimicked with smearing blood. The personal impression of Rasmussen about <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> that he believed in the forces and spirits. As Rasmussen asked him to draw some pictures about his experiences, even his visions about spirits, Arnaqaoq was first unwilling to do so (having fear of the spirits). Later he accepted the task, and he spent hours to re-experience his visions, sometimes so lucidly that he had to stop drawing when his whole body began to quiver.|$|E
25|$|On {{return to}} RAF Bomber Command the {{squadron}} took up its low-level daylight raids again until August of that year, when the aircraft {{of the unit}} and their pilots -the air detachment of the squadron- were sent to Malta. From there anti-shipping missions were carried out along the Axis' north-south convoy routes, around the Italian coast, Sicily, and along the North African coast. However, after the Italian and German air forces strengthened the air defence of Sicily in December, 1941, and began round-the-clock bombing of the Malta airfields, the air detachment was withdrawn and disbanded at Luqa on 12 January 1942. Losses among the squadron had been so heavy – 90% of all original and replacement crews were killed in action during the Malta operations – {{that at one time}} the squadron was commanded by a sergeant, I.G. Broom. It was not the last time <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> in command of a RAF unit, he ended his career as Air Marshal Sir Ivor Broom.|$|E

25|$|Police {{arrested a}} suspect that closely matched the {{description}} on Sunday. The suspect had gloves that Mrs. Harmon {{identified as the}} same gloves worn by her attacker. The man was also wearing blue clothes and khakis. The pocket knife the 33 year-old was carrying, though, had a blade much shorter than five inches. <b>This</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> also clean shaven.

According to the man's story about bumming around the country, he could not have been in Texarkana during the slaying of Virgil Starks. The man said that he left Pine Bluff {{in the latter part of}} April and went to Colorado. Officers said that they were going to thoroughly check his story. They kept him in jail for three weeks so his beard would grow back, which would allow Mrs. Harmon to positively identify him as her attacker.|$|E
25|$|FBI agents cannot legally store DNA of {{a person}} not convicted of a crime. DNA {{collected}} from a suspect not later convicted must be disposed of and not entered into the database. In 1998, a man residing in the UK was arrested on accusation of burglary. His DNA was taken and tested, and he was later released. Nine months later, this man's DNA was accidentally and illegally entered in the DNA database. New DNA is automatically compared to the DNA found at cold cases and, in this case, <b>this</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> {{found to be a}} match to DNA found at a rape and assault case one year earlier. The government then prosecuted him for these crimes. During the trial the DNA match was requested to be removed from the evidence because it had been illegally entered into the database.

25|$|Don Isaac Abrabanel, a {{prominent}} Jewish figure in Spain in the 15th century {{and one of}} the king’s trusted courtiers who witnessed the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, informs his readers that the first Jews to reach Spain were brought by ship to Spain by a certain Phiros who was confederate with the king of Babylon when he laid siege to Jerusalem. <b>This</b> <b>man</b> <b>was</b> a Grecian by birth, but who had been given a kingdom in Spain. He became related by marriage to a certain Espan, the nephew of king Heracles, who also ruled over a kingdom in Spain. This Heracles later renounced his throne because of his preference for his native country in Greece, leaving his kingdom to his nephew, Espan, by whom the country of España (Spain) derives its name. The Jewish exiles transported there by the said Phiros were descended by lineage from Judah, Benjamin, Shimon and Levi, and were, according to Abrabanel, settled in two districts in southern Spain: one, Andalusia, in the city of Lucenaa city so-called by the Jewish exiles that had come there; the second, in the country around Ṭulayṭulah (Toledo).|$|E
