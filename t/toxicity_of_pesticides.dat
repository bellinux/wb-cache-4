40|$|Abstract—Freshwater mussels {{are among}} the most imperiled faunal groups in North America; {{approximately}} 67 % of the nearly 300 native freshwater mussel species (family Unionidae) are listed as endangered, threatened, or of special concern. Despite evidence that glochidia and juvenile life stages are highly sensitive to some chemical contaminants, the effects <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> on early life stages of unionid mussels are largely unknown. In the United States, pesticide registration is based on <b>toxicity</b> data <b>of</b> the active ingredient, not formulations as they are sold and applied. Some pesticide formulations, however, are more toxic than their active ingredient (technical-grade <b>pesticide)</b> alone because <b>of</b> the presence of surfactants, adjuvants, or other ingredients in the formulation. The objective {{of the present study was}} to compare the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> active ingredients <b>of</b> several current-use <b>pesticides</b> (atrazine, chlorpyrifos, and permethrin) to the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> formulations to glochidia and juvenile life stages of a freshwater mussel (Lampsilis siliquoidea). The atrazine formulation (Aatrex) was more toxic than technical-grade atrazine in chronic tests with juvenile L. siliquoidea. For other pesticides, acute and chronic <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> technical-grade <b>pesticides</b> were similar to the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticide</b> formulations. Median effective concentrations for chlorpyrifos were 0. 43 mg/L for glochidia at 48 h, 0. 25 mg/L for juveniles at 96 h, and 0. 06 mg/L for juveniles at 21 d.

50|$|PON1 can {{inactivate}} some OPs through hydrolysis. PON1 hydrolyzes {{the active}} metabolites in several OP insecticides such as chlorpyrifos oxon, and diazoxon, as well as, nerve agents such as soman, sarin, and VX. PON1 hydrolyzes the metabolites, not the parent compounds of insectides. The presence of PON1 polymorphisms causes {{there to be}} different enzyme levels and catalytic efficiency of this esterase, which in turn suggests that different individuals may be more susceptible to the toxic effect of OP exposure. The level of PON1 plasma hydrolytic activity provides more protection against OP pesticides. Rats injected with purified PON1 from rabbit serum were more resistant to acute cholinergic activity than the control rats. PON1 knockouts in mice {{are found to be}} more sensitive to the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides,</b> like chlorpyrifos. Animal experiments indicate that while PON1 plays a significant role in regulating the toxicity of OPs its degree of protection given depends on the compound (i.e. Chlorpyrifos oxon or diazoxon). The catalytic efficiency with which PON1 can degrade toxic OPs determines the degree of protection that PON1 can provide for organism. The higher the concentration of PON1 the better the protection provided. PON1 activity is much lower in neonates, so neonates are more sensitive to OP exposure. In 2006, reports up to a 13-fold variation was seen in PON1 levels in adults, as well as, specifically regarding sensitivity to diazoxon, a variation up to 26 and 14-fold was reported in a group of newborns and Latino mothers. This wide range in variability of enzyme levels determining a humans sensitivity to various OPs is being researched further.|$|E

40|$|Soil {{microorganisms}} have {{a pivotal}} role in ecosystem functioning. In 2010, EFSA identified soil microorganisms as a specific protection goal for environmental risk assessment of pesticides. Despite that, the assessment of the soil microbial <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> still relies on an out-of-date N transformation test overlooking the recent methodological and standardization advances in soil microbial ecology. Within the frame of two EU-funded projects (ECOFUN-MICROBIODIV& LOVE-TO-HATE) we developed a toolbox of ISO standardized and of new methods which enable the comprehensive assessment of the <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides</b> on soil microorganisms following a tiered experimental approach. This involved pesticide testing against natural microbial assemblages,initially at laboratory-scale under high exposure conditions, followed by field-scale assessment under more realistic exposure scenarios. In 2017 EFSA proposed the use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) as one of the possible bioindicators to assess the soil microbial <b>toxicity</b> <b>of</b> <b>pesticides.</b> Mounting evidence suggest that ammonia-oxidizing microbes (AOM) constitute another could also serve asbioindicatorssince (a) they are sensitive to external disturbances including pesticides, (b) they mediate the rate-limiting step of N cycle and (c) there are ISOstandardized tools to measure their activity and abundance. Key experimental aspects of the scheme proposed are (a) the parallel determination of the dissipation and metabolism of pesticides to allow the identification of the compound (parent or metabolite) responsible for toxicity effects observed, (b) the duration of the tests should allow microbial recovery, (c) effects on microbial diversity, although powerful tools are now available their application is still far from standardized. The proposed tiered scheme could be augmented with an in vitro assessment step on representative AOMs and AMF as an initial conservative tierbefore testing against natural soil assemblages. However, certain aspects of in vitro testing require further development standardization. Acknowledgements : This work was funded in the frame of the IAPP-FP 7 -MSCA project LOVE-TO-HAT...|$|E
