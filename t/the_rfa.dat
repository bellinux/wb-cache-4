The troopers fast-roped {{into the village}} and {{immediately}} came under fire from the West Side Boys. Early on in the confrontation, the British operation sustained its first casualty—a round entered Trooper Bradley Tinnion's flank, leaving him seriously injured. He was dragged back to the helicopter and flown to the medical team aboard <b>the</b> <b>RFA</b> Sir Percivale, dying despite intensive resuscitation attempts on board. The SAS proceeded to clear the village, engaging those West Side Boys who offered resistance and capturing those who surrendered, including Foday Kallay.|$|E
5|$|The fort's defenders, the Royal Fencible American Regiment led by Joseph Goreham, {{a veteran}} of the French and Indian War, {{successfully}} repelled several attempts by Eddy's militia to storm the fort, and the siege was ultimately relieved when <b>the</b> <b>RFA</b> plus Royal Marine reinforcements drove off the besiegers on November 29. In retaliation for the role of locals who supported the siege, numerous homes and farms were destroyed, and Patriot sympathizers were driven out of the area. The successful defense of Fort Cumberland preserved the territorial integrity of the British Maritime possessions, and Nova Scotia remained loyal throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} June 1775, Colonel Joseph Goreham {{had been ordered}} by General Thomas Gage to raise the Royal Fencible American Regiment of Foot and natives in Nova Scotia {{for the defense of}} the {{province}} against Patriot activity. Arriving at the fort in the summer of 1776, Colonel Goreham and a garrison of 200 Loyalist troops of <b>the</b> <b>RFA</b> did what they could to restore the premises to a defensible condition. But Goreham had not been adequately provisioned and his men lacked everything from victuals to uniforms. Furthermore, the locals were generally sympathetic to the Patriot cause, and refused to assist in rehabilitating the fort, even trying to induce members of the garrison to defect.|$|E

On 12 December 1914 the whole division embarked at Southampton and disembarked at Bombay 4–8 January 1915. <b>The</b> <b>RFA</b> batteries arrived with the same strength of five officers and 140 other ranks, equipped with four 15-pounders.

Cammell Laird completed the three vessels, with Hudson Cavalier launching on 24 July 1975, and after sea trials were completed, all three were laid up in port while the shipbuilder sought to charter or sell them. On 27 October 1978, the Ministry of Defence expressed interest in chartering two of the tankers, and after conversion for use as an underway replenishment vessel, Hudson Cavalier entered service with <b>the</b> <b>RFA</b> on 8 June 1979 as RFA Appleleaf.

40|$|Purpose: Limited {{restoration}} of function {{is known to}} occur spontaneously after an ischemic injury to the primary motor cortex. Evidence suggests that Pre-Motor Areas (PMAs) may "take over" control of the disrupted functions. However, {{little is known about}} functional reorganizations in PMAs. Forelimb movements in mice can be driven by two cortical regions, Caudal and Rostral Forelimb Areas (CFA and RFA), generally accepted as primary motor and premotor cortex, respectively. Here, we examined longitudinal changes in functional coupling between <b>the</b> two <b>RFAs</b> following unilateral photothrombotic stroke in CFA (mm from Bregma: + 0. 5 anterior, + 1. 25 lateral). Methods: Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from <b>the</b> <b>RFAs</b> of both hemispheres in freely moving injured and naïve mice. Neural signals were acquired at 9, 16 and 23 days after surgery (sub-acute period in stroke animals) through one bipolar electrode per hemisphere placed in <b>the</b> center of <b>RFA,</b> with a ground screw over the occipital bone. LFPs were preprocessed through an efficient method of artifact removal and analysed through: spectral, cross-correlation, mutual information and Granger causality analysis. Results: Spectral analysis demonstrated an early decrease (day 9) in the alpha band power in both <b>the</b> <b>RFAs.</b> In <b>the</b> late sub-acute period (days 16 and 23), inter-hemispheric functional coupling was reduced in ischemic animals, as shown by a decrease in the cross-correlation and mutual information measures. Within the gamma and delta bands, correlation measures were already reduced at day 9. Granger analysis, used as a measure of the symmetry of the inter-hemispheric causal connectivity, showed a less balanced activity in <b>the</b> two <b>RFAs</b> after stroke, with more frequent oscillations of hemispheric dominance. Conclusions: These results indicate robust electrophysiological changes in PMAs after stroke. Specifically, we found alterations in transcallosal connectivity, with reduced inter-hemispheric functional coupling and a fluctuating dominance pattern. These reorganizations may underlie vicariation of lost functions following stroke...|$|R
