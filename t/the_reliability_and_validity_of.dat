In {{order to}} reveal the {{incentive}} functions of customer relationship management (CRM) strategy {{in the process of}} core competency cultivation, the structure equation modeling (SEM) is used in this paper. By research hypothesis, model deduction, <b>reliability</b> <b>and</b> verification test, and model checking, SEM can effectively reveal the correlation between CRM strategy and core competence cultivation in Chinese city commercial banks. For illustration, the collected copies are 300 banks, and 298 copies are valid. The sample ratio of sample data and indicators is 6 : 1, which meets the basic requirements for structural equation test.
