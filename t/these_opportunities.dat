5|$|Later, Gladwell compares Langan with Oppenheimer, {{the father}} of the atomic bomb. Noting that they typify innate natural {{abilities}} that should have helped them both succeed in life, Gladwell argues that Oppenheimer's upbringing made a pivotal difference in his life. Oppenheimer grew up in one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in Manhattan, {{was the son of a}} successful businessman and a painter, attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School on Central Park West, and was afforded a childhood of concerted cultivation. Outliers argues that <b>these</b> <b>opportunities</b> gave Oppenheimer the chance to develop the practical intelligence necessary for success. Gladwell then provides an anecdote: When Oppenheimer was a student at University of Cambridge he attempted to poison one of his tutors. He avoided punishment, and continued his studies by using the skills gained from his cultivated upbringing in his negotiation with the university's administrators, who had wanted to expel him.|$|E
5|$|Secretary Stanton ordered McClellan {{to report}} to Trenton, New Jersey, for further orders, {{although}} none were issued. As the war progressed, there were various calls to return McClellan to an important command, following the Union defeats at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, as Robert E. Lee moved north {{at the start of}} the Gettysburg Campaign, and as Jubal Early threatened Washington in 1864. When Ulysses S. Grant became general-in-chief, he discussed returning McClellan to an unspecified position. But all of <b>these</b> <b>opportunities</b> were impossible, given the opposition within the administration and the knowledge that McClellan posed a potential political threat. McClellan worked for months on a lengthy report describing his two major campaigns and his successes in organizing the Army, replying to his critics and justifying his actions by accusing the administration of undercutting him and denying him necessary reinforcements. The War Department was reluctant to publish his report because, just after completing it in October 1863, McClellan openly declared his entrance to the political stage as a Democrat.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} {{economic factors}} affecting the declining fer-tility rate in Japan. A {{major cause of}} this continuous decline is the increasing participation {{of women in the}} labor force. This, in turn, increases the opportunity costs of having children for a family. <b>These</b> <b>opportunity</b> costs are closely related to the scarcity of full-time jobs for women due to the fixed employment practices of major Japanese companies. A crucial policy for stabilizing the fertility rate is to reduce the opportunity costs of women by increasing child-care services and promoting the creation of jobs for those who are beyond the child-rearing age. 1...|$|R

25|$|By 1947, {{only three}} Canadian oil {{pipelines}} moved product to market. One transported oil from Turner Valley to Calgary. A second moved imported crude from coastal Maine to Montreal while the third brought American mid-continent oil into Ontario. But the Leduc strike and subsequent discoveries in Alberta created {{an opportunity for}} pipeline building on a grander scale. As reserves increased, producers clamored for markets. With its population density and an extensive refining system that relied on the United States and the Caribbean for crude oil, Ontario was an excellent prospect. The west coast offered another logical choice - closer still, although separated from the oilfields by the daunting Rocky Mountains.

25|$|Greenville, Mississippi had {{the most}} Sicilian {{immigrants}} out of other cities in the delta. Most immigrants first settled in New Orleans {{and worked in the}} sugar cane and cotton fields. Later on when they arrived in the Delta, they began to settle in towns, which enabled them to open up grocery stores, restaurants, and fruit stands. Because they lived in towns, rather than on farms, they had access to higher quality education, which they took advantage of. Because of <b>these</b> <b>opportunities,</b> young Sicilian immigrants were able to grow up and established and enter into the workforce much faster than Central Italian immigrants.

25|$|Poverty {{is another}} factor that {{facilitates}} the continual existence of gender disparities in health. Poverty often works in tandem with various cultural norms to indirectly impact women's health. While many communities and households are not opposed to helping women attain better health through education, better nutrition, and financial stability, poverty often act {{as a form of}} barrier against gender equity in health for women. Oftentimes, due to financial constraints and limited capital, only a select few are able to receive opportunities, like education and employment, that might help them attain better health outcomes. However, cultural norms would often prioritized men in receiving <b>these</b> <b>opportunities.</b> This prioritization of males stems from the societal perception that the potential returns to both the household and the community is higher for men than women.|$|E
25|$|Cage left Seattle in {{the summer}} of 1941 after the painter László Moholy-Nagy invited him to teach at the Chicago School of Design (what later became the IIT Institute of Design. The {{composer}} accepted partly because he hoped to find opportunities in Chicago, that were not available in Seattle, to organize a center for experimental music. <b>These</b> <b>opportunities</b> did not materialize. Cage taught at the Chicago School of Design and worked as accompanist and composer at the University of Chicago. At one point, his reputation as percussion composer landed him a commission from the Columbia Broadcasting System to compose a soundtrack for a radio play by Kenneth Patchen. The result, The City Wears a Slouch Hat, was received well, and Cage deduced that more important commissions would follow. Hoping to find these, he left Chicago for New York City in the spring of 1942.|$|E
40|$|Australian {{policies}} to preserve native vegetation on farms rest on mandatory regulations without compensation, whereas policies in most OECD countries rest on voluntary conservation with compensation. In New South Wales, the Native Vegetation Conservation Act 1998 restricts farmers from clearing native vegetation {{on their own}} freehold land, and offers no compensation. The Act may therefore impose opportunity costs, or losses in income, on landholders. <b>These</b> <b>opportunity</b> costs are estimated for a case study property in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, and these results are then generalised to assess the broad trade-offs between development and preservation. The losses in income appear to vary between 5 and 10 per cent of annual income, depending on livestock prices. The flow of these losses over time appears to total some $ 26 m for all properties of this kind in the immediate region. In addition to imposition of <b>these</b> direct <b>opportunity</b> costs, the regulations hinder land sales and so hinder adjustment by landholders to changing conditions.
