5|$|After {{the first}} salvo from the 15cm {{batteries}} in Drøbak, the steering {{from the bridge}} was disabled. Blücher had just passed Drøbakgrunnen (Drøbak shallows) and was in a turn to port. The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts, but she lost speed. Normally the rudder is controlled electrically from the bridge to the motors forward of the Handsteuerraum (hand steering room) deep under the armored deck, forward of the rudder. In an emergency it can be switched within seconds to manual steering, but orders from the bridge to the rudder may be delayed. At 04:34 Norwegian land-based torpedo batteries scored two hits on the ship. The targeting device in the torpedo battery was very primitive. <b>The</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> torpedo was known and set, but <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target had to be adjusted by dead reckoning (guessing).|$|E

5|$|After {{service in}} the Mediterranean the brigade {{returned}} to Woodhall Spa in Lincolnshire, where it was reinforced {{by the arrival of}} the 7th Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers in November 1943. During the D-Day landings of 6 June 1944, the 1st Airlanding Brigade was part of the strategic reserve, on standby to deploy wherever they were needed to support the invasion. The division and brigade were next assigned to Operation Market Garden at Arnhem in the Netherlands. This entailed three airborne divisions capturing bridges to be used subsequently by the British Second Army. Prior to the operation, more than 15 planned airborne missions into France and Belgium had been cancelled due to <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allied advance.|$|E
5|$|As {{the group}} left Plateros at 22:30 to trek back towards American lines, Pajota and his guerrillas {{continually}} sought out local villagers {{to provide additional}} carabao carts to transport the weakened prisoners. The majority of the prisoners {{had little or no}} clothing and shoes, and it became increasingly difficult for them to walk. When the group reached Balincarin, they had accumulated nearly 50carts. Despite the convenience of using the carts, the carabao traveled at a sluggish pace, only , which greatly reduced <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> return trip. By the time the group reached American lines, 106carts were being used.|$|E
5|$|At this distance, {{the land}} {{would be far}} beyond the maximum {{anticipated}} size of the city's growth, greatly reducing any potential hazards. The London and South Western Railway(LSWR)– which had connected London to Woking in 1838– would enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply. Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London, Broun and Sprye argued that <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> railway made it both quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries, all of which required a slow and expensive horse-drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site.|$|E

5|$|At this time, the {{efficacy}} of the Chapman–Jouguet model was still in doubt, and it was the subject of studies by John von Neumann at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study. Kistiakowsky realized that the deviations from hydrodynamic theory were the result of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chemical reactions themselves. To control the reaction, calculations down to the microsecond level were needed. Section 8 was drawn into the investigation of shaped charges, whose mechanism was explained by Taylor and James Tuck in 1943.|$|E

5|$|During {{a central}} eclipse, the Moon's umbra (or antumbra, {{in the case}} of an annular eclipse) moves rapidly from west to east across the Earth. The Earth is also {{rotating}} from west to east, at about 28km/min at the Equator, but as the Moon is moving in the same direction as the Earth's spin at about 61km/min, the umbra almost always appears to move in a roughly west-east direction across a map of the Earth at <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon's orbital velocity minus the Earth's rotational velocity.|$|E
50|$|Likewise, <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> {{an idler}} wheel in a non-geared {{friction}} drive {{system does not}} affect the gear ratio between the input and output shafts. <b>The</b> surface <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input shaft is transferred directly to <b>the</b> surface <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idler wheel, and then from the idler wheel to the output shaft. A larger or smaller idler wheel maintains <b>the</b> same surface <b>speed</b> (which equals <b>the</b> surface <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> input shaft), therefore the output shaft is driven at a constant <b>speed</b> regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idler wheel.|$|R

5|$|In 2007, a {{researcher}} remarked that only little technical {{information is available}} about lenses, shutters and <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> photographic media, but reported that Neubronner obtained the film for his panoramic camera from ADOX. For this camera he estimated a film speed of ISO 25/15°–40/17° and a shutter speed of 1/60s–1/100s. The film was cut to the format 30mm×60mm and bent into a concave shape to prevent unnecessary distortion due to the half-circle movement of the lens.|$|E
5|$|In England {{the brigade}} trained for {{operations}} in North-West Europe {{under the supervision}} of the I Airborne Corps. Although they were not scheduled to take part in the Normandy landings, under Operation Tuxedo the brigade would be parachuted in to support operations if any of the five invasion beaches experienced difficulties. Tuxedo was the only operation planned where the brigade would act as an independent formation whereas 13 other operations were prepared which would have deployed the entire 1st Airborne Division.
