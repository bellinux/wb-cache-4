5|$|The Maya {{viewed the}} cosmos as highly structured; there were {{thirteen}} levels in <b>the</b> <b>heavens,</b> <b>and</b> nine {{levels in the}} underworld; the mortal world occupied a position between <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> <b>and</b> the underworld. Each level had four cardinal directions associated with a different colour. Major deities had aspects associated with these directions and colours; north was white, east was red, south was yellow, and west was black.|$|E

5|$|In Hindu mythology, the Ganges River Dolphin is {{associated}} with Ganga, the deity of the Ganges river.

5|$|In medieval Scandinavia, Snorri Sturluson {{wrote in}} his Prose Edda of ljósálfar and døkkálfar ('light-elves and dark-elves'), the ljósálfar living in <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> <b>and</b> the døkkálfar under the earth. The {{consensus}} of modern scholarship is that Snorri's elves are based on angels and demons of Christian cosmology.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} Stars was likely {{influenced}} by Escher's own interest in both geometry and astronomy, {{by a long}} history of using geometric forms to model <b>the</b> <b>heavens,</b> <b>and</b> by a drawing style used by Leonardo da Vinci. Commentators have interpreted the cage's compound shape as a reference to double and triple stars in astronomy, or to twinned crystals in crystallography. The image contrasts the celestial order of its polyhedral shapes with the more chaotic forms of biology.|$|E

5|$|The {{first group}} shows God {{creating}} <b>the</b> <b>Heavens</b> <b>and</b> the Earth. The second group shows God creating {{the first man}} and woman, Adam and Eve, and their disobedience of God and consequent expulsion from the Garden of Eden where they have lived and where they walked with God. The third group of three pictures shows the plight of Humanity {{and in particular the}} family of Noah.|$|E
5|$|The {{story is}} preceded by 27 panels showing various preparations, in <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> <b>and</b> on the earth, {{to welcome the}} final {{incarnation}} of the Bodhisattva. Before descending from Tushita heaven, the Bodhisattva entrusted his crown to his successor, the future Buddha Maitreya. He descended on earth {{in the shape of}} white elephants with six tusks, penetrated to Queen Maya's right womb. Queen Maya had a dream of this event, which was interpreted that his son would become either a sovereign or a Buddha.|$|E
5|$|The use of polyhedra {{to model}} heavenly bodies {{can be traced}} back to Plato, who in the Timaeus {{identified}} the regular dodecahedron with the shape of <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> <b>and</b> its twelve faces with the constellations of the zodiac. Later, Johannes Kepler theorized that the distribution of distances of the planets from the sun could be explained by the shapes of the five Platonic solids, nested within each other. Escher kept a model of this system of nested polyhedra, and regularly depicted polyhedra in his artworks relating to astronomy and other worlds.|$|E

5|$|Traditional {{beliefs and}} uses for slow lorises vary, and many {{practices}} {{appear to have}} deep roots going back at least 300years. Oral traditions suggest these practices go back even further. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, {{it was reported that}} the people from the interior of the island of Borneo believed that slow lorises were the gatekeepers for <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> <b>and</b> that each person had a personal slow loris waiting for them in the afterlife. More often, however, slow lorises are used in traditional medicine or to ward off evil.|$|E
5|$|Beads {{made from}} {{meteoric}} iron in 3500BC or earlier {{were found in}} Gerzah, Egypt by G. A. Wainwright. The beads contain 7.5% nickel, which is a signature of meteoric origin since iron found in the Earth's crust generally has only minuscule nickel impurities. Meteoric iron was highly regarded due to its origin in <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> <b>and</b> was often used to forge weapons and tools. For example, a dagger made of meteoric iron {{was found in the}} tomb of Tutankhamun, containing similar proportions of iron, cobalt, and nickel to a meteorite discovered in the area, deposited by an ancient meteor shower. Items that were likely made of iron by Egyptians date from 3000 to 2500BC. Meteoritic iron is comparably soft and ductile and easily forged by cold working but may get brittle when heated because of the nickel content.|$|E
5|$|Rinuccini used {{numerous}} classical {{sources as}} the basis for his libretto, in particular works of Ovid—the Heroides and the Metamorphoses—and poems from Catullus. After a prologue, the main action begins as Venus tells Cupid that Ariadne and her lover Theseus, fleeing from Crete after his slaying of the Minotaur, will shortly arrive in Naxos. Theseus, she reports, will then abandon Ariadne, as he believes her to be unacceptable to the people of Athens as their queen. Venus plans to match her instead with the god Bacchus, and asks Cupid to arrange this. Theseus and Arianna arrive; Theseus agonises over his decision to abandon her, but is advised by his counsellor that he is wise in his resolve, and departs. In the morning Ariadne, finding herself abandoned, searches vainly for Theseus on the shore, where she sings her lament. A fanfare indicates an imminent arrival; Ariadne hopes this is Theseus returning, but it is Bacchus and his entourage. Jupiter speaks from <b>the</b> <b>heavens,</b> <b>and</b> amid festive scenes Bacchus promises Ariadne immortality with the gods in return for her love.|$|E

5|$|Scully is {{approached}} by the Dark Figure, who is {{revealed to be}} a Seraph, an angel who descended from <b>the</b> <b>heavens</b> <b>and</b> fathered four children with a mortal woman. God sent the Seraph to return the girls to Heaven {{in order to keep}} the Devil from claiming them as his own. Scully and Starkey find the fourth girl, Roberta Dyer (Perkins) at Gregory's church. However, Scully sees Starkey's horned shadow, revealing his true origins. Scully tries to help Roberta escape, but the women are confronted by the Seraph. She reluctantly lets go of Roberta's hand, after seeing Emily in place of Roberta, and lets her enter Heaven. Later, Scully tells Mulder they should have been protecting the girls from Starkey, not Gregory. She also believes that they are now in a place where they were meant to be.|$|E
