25|$|Esma Sultan, the {{daughter}} of Sultan Abdul Hamid I and aunt of Sultan Abdülmecid I, lived in luxury in her magnificent villa in Istanbul, but still her life passed in sadness because {{she could not have}} the one thing she wished for most; a child. At length she decided to adopt a child, {{the daughter}} of Gök Bey Gogen who belonged to one of the noble families of the Ubykh tribe of Circassia in the Ottoman Empire, after reaching satisfactory terms with the mother and father, when Rahime was a toddler one year of age. the child was particularly diminutive, delicate and graceful, so she renamed her Perestu, the Persian word for swallow. All the kalfas in Esma Sultan's villa behaved toward this child as <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> a daughter of an Ottoman imperial princess, and indeed her disposition and manners were so lovely that they became devoted to her. In the mean time Princess Esma Sultan carefully arranged the training and education of Perestu. She had three brothers, Mustafa, Hüseyn and Hasan Bey, and two sisters, Fatma Gülcemal Hanım and Mihrifidan Hanım.|$|E

They met when {{cast in a}} touring production of The Seagull in early 1995 and moved in together shortly afterwards. In 1997, they voiced a radio production of Romeo and Juliet. Their daughter, Lily, was born in London in 1999. The actress has said she was [...] "embarrassed" [...] that Sheen never proposed, but felt as <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> married. Their relationship ended in early 2003, after the filming of Underworld. Beckinsale and Sheen remain close friends. She remarked in 2016: [...] "He's really dear, close family. He's somebody I've known since I was 21 years old. I really love him a lot." ...|$|E

Kelvin later causes her to panic by suddenly leaving the room and shutting the door behind him. [...] She hysterically tears {{her way through the}} room's metal door, severely cutting herself. [...] Before he can give first aid, her injuries spontaneously heal before his eyes. [...] Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) calls for a meeting, and Kelvin introduces Hari as his wife. [...] In their symposium, the scientists explain to Kelvin that Solaris created Hari from his memories of her. [...] The Hari present among them, though not human, thinks and feels as <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were.</b> [...] Sartorius theorizes that the visitors are composed of [...] "neutrino systems" [...] but that it might still be possible to destroy them through use of an offscreen device known as [...] "the annihilator".|$|E
500|$|The {{number of}} cover songs, which play a {{prominent}} role in Carlile's live act, represented what she typically includes in a concert. Carlile said that she felt as <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> a member of The Beatles when the audience stood and loudly sang the words to [...] "Dreams", and that [...] "Before It Breaks" [...] and [...] "I Will" [...] were emotionally the most difficult to perform. Carlile jokes with the audience between songs, which she felt was well-received, and requests their participation in three-part harmony during [...] "Turpentine". During the concert, the band experienced technical difficulties, and a bra thrown from the audience, intended for the drummer, hit Carlile on stage. Carlile said the [...] "rock 'n' roll symphony album" [...] was [...] "the meeting of two worlds, two different kinds of artists who got together for completely different reasons." [...] She has said that the album is the one she and her band are most proud of, believing it truly represents their live act.|$|E
500|$|Palmerston died in 1865, {{and after}} a brief {{ministry}} led by Russell, Derby returned to power. In 1866, Victoria attended the State Opening of Parliament {{for the first time}} since Albert's death. The following year she supported the passing of the Reform Act 1867 which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise to many urban working men, though she was not in favour of votes for women. Derby resigned in 1868, to be replaced by Benjamin Disraeli, who charmed Victoria. [...] "Everyone likes flattery," [...] he said, [...] "and when you come to royalty you should lay it on with a trowel." [...] With the phrase [...] "we authors, Ma'am", he complimented her. Disraeli's ministry only lasted a matter of months, and at the end of the year his Liberal rival, William Ewart Gladstone, was appointed prime minister. Victoria found Gladstone's demeanour far less appealing; he spoke to her, she is thought to have complained, as <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> [...] "a public meeting rather than a woman".|$|E

500|$|In 1952, O'Hara played Claire, the {{daughter}} of the musketeer, Athos in At Sword's Point, which according to her showed the [...] "new Maureen O'Hara". [...] The film had actually been made in 1949 but was not released until 1952. The role was the most physically demanding of her career, doing her own stunts and training in the art of fencing for six weeks under the Belgian-born fencing master, Fred Cavens. [...] She disliked director Lewis Allen and producer Howard Hughes, whom she thought was [...] "cold as ice". The critic from The New York Times appreciated O'Hara's swordsmanship in the film, stating that she was [...] "snarling like a Fury, impales her opponents as <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> threading a needle." [...] O'Hara next played Irish immigrant Australian-based cowgirl, Dell McGuire, in Lewis Milestone's drama Kangaroo (1952), set during the drought of 1900. Kangaroo is noted for being the first Technicolor film to be shot on-location in Australia, mostly shot in the desert near Port Augusta. Although O'Hara disliked the production, she found the Australians extremely welcoming. The Australian government offered her a plot of land during the production to own permanently but she turned it down for political reasons only to later discover that there were significant oil reserves on the land.|$|E
500|$|The film's entire {{recording}} process took {{approximately three}} years to complete, during which Kelly's sessions were held in both the United States and Canada, while her co-stars Broderick and Jeremy Irons, voice of Scar, were recording in the United States and England, respectively. Each main cast member recorded their dialogue separately, which took Kelly some time {{to get used to}} because she had grown accustomed to working with several other actors at a time on the sets of live-action films. For The Lion King, a director would often take the place of another actor for Kelly to act opposite of. Vocally, Kelly decided to approach the role as <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> reading to a child, explaining, [...] "it's kind of fun to play with different voices and try to color the lines for the child so they can imagine it more fully", which she admitted is different than how the actress would approach a live-action role. Because Nala is a [...] "very straight character", determining what kind of voice she would use for her was not a particularly challenging task. Additionally, the filmmakers would also film Kelly's performances in order to incorporate her own facial expressions into her character's design, the process of which impressed the actress. In her film debut, actress Niketa Calame voices young Nala. According to Calame's official website, Nala remains the actress' [...] "biggest role to date". A classically trained pianist and chorister, Laura Williams provides the singing voice of young Nala, which can be heard in the song [...] "I Just Can't Wait to Be King"; the singer was 15 years old at the time. Meanwhile, singer-songwriter Sally Dworsky provides the singing voice of adult Nala, which is heard during the song [...] "Can You Feel the Love Tonight". The film's love theme, [...] "Can You Feel the Love Tonight"'s lyrics were re-written approximately 15 times, according to lyricist Tim Rice, who wrote the song alongside composer Elton John. At one point, the producers wanted the song to be a comical duet performed by supporting characters Timon and Pumbaa, despite the fact that John had originally composed the song with Nala and Simba in mind. However, John lobbied in favor of [...] "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" [...] being a love song performed as a duet by Nala and Simba, with which the filmmakers ultimately agreed.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2013, Will Potter {{broke the}} news in his Green is the New Red blog that the first charge based on Utah's new [...] "ag gag" [...] law had been made against a woman, Amy Meyer, who had {{reportedly}} filmed a slaughterhouse in Draper, Utah using her smart phone. The charges had actually been filed February 19, with the filming occurring on February 8, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. She was charged with a Class B misdemeanor under the new law. However, {{a day after the}} news broke, the public prosecutor dropped the case against her, citing [...] "new evidence" [...] received during a hearing April 18. Prosecutor Benjamin Rasmussen explained that Meyer had provided [...] "video footage showing that she was on public property during {{at least some of the}} time she was filming the slaughterhouse". Meyer had previously pleaded not guilty to the charge. Both she and her defense attorney, Stewart Gollan, claim that she never left public property. According to a written statement, Meyer observed several examples of animal cruelty at the slaughterhouse, including [...] "a live cow who appeared to be sick or injured being carried away from the building in a tractor, as <b>though</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> nothing more than rubble", as well as [...] "piles of horns scattered around the property and flesh being spewed from a chute on the side of the building".|$|E
