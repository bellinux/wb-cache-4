5|$|Veronica starts her {{criminology}} class. Veronica solves {{a mystery}} given {{out in the}} class in six minutes. Logan (Jason Dohring), who is also at Hearst, is still dating Veronica. Dick (Ryan Hansen) has just returned, getting into Hearst, but he is shaken up from Beaver’s suicide. Vinnie (Ken Marino) approaches Keith (Enrico Colantoni) with a case, but he denies it. Keith is tracking a bail-jumper. Stosh “Piz” Piznarski becomes Wallace’s (Percy Daggs III) roommate, and Piz loses all his belongings. Veronica comes in to help. Keith’s bail-jumper, Cormac Fitzpatrick (Jason Beghe) and he gets into the car with Keith. Veronica and Mac listen to a rape victim protesting the university’s policies on the issue. Soon, Dick crashes the rally. Keith tells Cormac that he helped Kendall (Charisma Carpenter) get out of town, and Cormac is being targeted by the Fitzpatricks. Veronica and Piz visit the police department, and <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> have been other victims. Veronica learns that the Hearst “Welcome Wagon” is actually fake.|$|E
25|$|People have asked, so {{what are}} the demands? What are the demands all of these people are making? Either <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> are no demands and that leaves your critics confused, or they say that the demands for social {{equality}} and economic justice are impossible demands. And the impossible demands, they say, are just not practical. If hope is an impossible demand, then we demand the impossible – that the right to shelter, food and employment are impossible demands, then we demand the impossible. If it is impossible to demand that those who profit from the recession redistribute their wealth and cease their greed, then yes, we demand the impossible.|$|E
500|$|Tickets for the Best of Both Worlds Tour {{were selling}} out quite rapidly. Nevertheless, ticket {{scalping}} {{was one of}} the primary reasons for it. Many tickets were immediately found for purchase on secondary markets, such as eBay or StubHub, selling for well over the face value of the tickets. Broker prices ranged from $350 to $2,000 for the tickets originally sold for $29 to $66. The shortage of tickets for the tour became so pronounced it gained national attention, with parents frequently expressing their outrage, discontent, and disappointment on behalf of their children. Vice president of Ticketmaster, Joe Freeman commented, [...] "Hell hath no fury like the parent of a child throwing a tantrum. People who have been in this business for a long time are watching what's happening, and <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> hasn't been a demand of this level or intensity since The Beatles or Elvis [...]" [...] In an instance, a girl was unable to undergo a surgery she needed due to monetary issues, so she sold her tickets to a show of the tour for enough money to pay for the surgery. Debra Rathwell, senior vice president of AEG Live said the tickets were priced and sold as fairly as possible and assured there as no conspiracy between those who handled the tour and brokers. [...] "We do everything in our power to stop brokers from getting tickets, but it's impossible", she concluded. However, some brokers denied the allegations of purchasing most tickets for the shows. Brian Posey, owner of The Ticket Machine, an online broker based in East Lansing, Michigan, commented, [...] "I've never seen this as far as availability for any show. It's never been that hard to get tickets for us. You don't see seats anywhere. Parents shouldn't blame brokers for snapping up loads of tickets." [...] He continued to complain that the company was only able to purchase 28 tickets, while they usually averaged hundreds of tickets for hot tours.|$|E

2500|$|Fox and Thomson (2005) {{argue that}} consent cannot be given for non-therapeutic circumcision. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> is [...] "no {{compelling}} legal {{authority for the}} common view that circumcision is lawful." ...|$|E

2500|$|In any {{scenario}} where {{statements are}} assumed to be either true or false, a person whom we know is consistently lying would paradoxically be a source of truth, by taking the opposite of whatever <b>they</b> <b>say.</b> <b>There</b> are many such paradoxes, the most famous being known as the liar paradox, commonly expressed as [...] "This sentence is a lie", or [...] "This sentence is false." [...] The so-called Epimenides paradox ("All Cretans are liars", as stated by Epimenides the Cretan) is a forerunner of this, though its status as a paradox is disputed. A class of related logic puzzles are known as knights and knaves, in which the goal is to determine who, in a group of people, is lying and who is telling the truth.|$|E

6000|$|... "What I've {{arranged}} is, {{that you}} shall ride to town {{the last thing}} to-night; leave here about nine, and wait a while there, getting home about twelve. If nothing has been received by eleven to-night, <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>there's</b> no chance at all." ...|$|R

5000|$|In response, the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, stated: [...] "Clearly, {{they don't}} {{practice}} what <b>they</b> preach. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>there's</b> {{a moral obligation}} for homeowners to repay their mortgages yet they don't believe that applies to them. This is why the American people are absolutely disgusted with bankers." ...|$|R
60|$|HILLCRIST. You insist? Well, <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> {{was some}} {{question}} about the accounts, and your wife left them under a cloud. As I told you, we don't believe it.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, mother, {{you stop}} here, and I {{will go up}} to London. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> is lots of work there, and I suppose I can get on as well as another." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They say 'tis a funny place, too." [...] Her rogue eyes gleamed {{from under}} a heavy frown. [...] "It'd not be all 'Do this' an' 'Do that'; an' 'You bad girl' an' 'You little hussy!' in London. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>there's</b> room for more'n one sort of girl there." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that. S'posen I started right here, then I'd be rubbin' against you; an' it's {{pretty much the}} same everywhere.
