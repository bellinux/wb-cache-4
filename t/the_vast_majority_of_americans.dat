5|$|In {{terms of}} social class the average American may be {{referred}} to as being either a member of the middle or working class. The discrepancy is largely the result of differing class models and definitions of what constitutes a member of the middle class. Currently <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> self-identify as middle class, yet some experts in the field such Michael Zweig of Stony Brook University or Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University have brought forth different theories. As most Americans are neither professionals nor managers and lack college degrees the average American may be described as being either or both, lower middle and working class.|$|E

25|$|Historically, interracial {{marriage}} in the United States was of great public opposition (often a taboo), especially among whites.

25|$|The {{difference}} between these two approaches, and their impact on teen behavior, remains a controversial subject. In the U.S., teenage birth rates had been dropping since 1991, but a 2007 report showed a 3% increase from 2005 to 2006. From 1991 to 2005, the percentage of teens reporting that they had ever had sex or were currently sexually active showed small declines. However, the U.S. still has the highest teen birth rate and one of the highest rates of STIs among teens in the industrialized world. Public opinion polls conducted over the years have found that <b>the</b> <b>vast</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>Americans</b> favor broader sex education programs over those that teach only abstinence, although abstinence educators recently published poll data with the opposite conclusion.|$|E
