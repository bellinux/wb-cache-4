50|$|About 2:24 a.m., {{with most}} {{passengers}} asleep, the locomotive reached Rockport Crossing. The lead pair of engine-truck wheels hit the clogged flangeways at the crossing and derailed the trucks to the right. With the left truck wheels running {{just inside the}} rails, and the right truck wheels just outside the rails, the engine continued down the track for another 198 feet (61 m) until the left front truck wheel hit a crossover frog from a <b>trailing</b> <b>switch</b> (part of a vestigal railroad switch track for a railroad siding at the location that in 1925 no longer existed), diverting the engine {{to the right and}} causing it to derail entirely. As the engine left the roadbed, it tilted to the left and buried itself in the railroad embankment parallel to the railroad tracks, with {{the front end of the}} engine 450 feet (138 m) from the east end of the Hazen Road crossing. The rapid deceleration of the engine caused the first passenger car, No. 23, to uncouple from the tender. The momentum of the cars behind it pushed No. 23 forward until it came to rest on the locomotive's boiler; the second passenger car, No. 33, followed, coming to rest across the rear of the boiler. The third car, the sleeper car Sirocco, came to rest next to the engine. The first two cars were carrying 90 people, the third nearly 20.|$|E

40|$|Objective: While memory {{tests are}} {{designed}} to measure the ability to store and retrieve information, other non-memory cognitive abilities are required to perform these tasks. Demographic factors also impact memory test performance. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the influence of non-memory cognitive abilities and demographic variables on memory test performance in a clinical sample. Method: Participants were 105 patients (54. 3 % female), average age = 46. 83 (14. 38), average education = 13. 83 (2. 36), who completed neuropsychological evaluation. Stepwise regression analyses were conducted to determine which non-memory cognitive abilities and demographic factors accounted for the most unique variance in performance on commonly used memory tests. Results: Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System <b>Trails</b> <b>Switching</b> accounted for 22 - 33 % of the variance in trials of the California Verbal Learning Test-II. Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV) Matrix Reasoning subtest accounted for 11 - 12 % of the variance in Logical Memory I and II from the Wechsler Memory Scale, Fourth Edition (WMS-IV). WAIS-IV Block Design accounted for 24 % of the variance in WMS-IV Visual Reproduction I and II and 25 - 29 % of the variance in the recall trials of the Rey Complex Figure Test. Conclusions: Non-memory cognitive abilities have a stronger influence on memory test performance than demographic factors. In particular, executive functions are most strongly associated with auditory-verbal memory performance, while visual-spatial/construction abilities are most strongly associated with visual-graphic memory performance. When interpreting memory test performance, it is important to be cognizant of these non-memory cognitive influences...|$|R

40|$|Fiber optic {{technologies}} enabling high-speed, high-capacity {{digital information}} transport {{have only been}} around for about 3 decades but in their short life have completely revolutionized global communications. To {{keep pace with the}} growing demand for digital communications and entertainment, fiber optic networks and technologies continue to grow and mature. As new applications in telecommunications, computer networking and entertainment emerge, reliability, scalability, and high Quality of Service (QoS) requirements are increasing the complexity of optical transport networks.;This dissertation is devoted to providing a discussion of existing and emerging technologies in modern optical communications networks. To this end, we first outline traditional telecommunication and data networks that enable high speed, long distance information transport. We examine various network architectures including mesh, ring and bus topologies of modern Local, Metropolitan and Wide area networks. We present some of the most successful technologies used in todays communications networks, outline their shortcomings and introduce promising new technologies {{to meet the demands of}} future transport networks.;The capacity of a single wavelength optical signal is 10 Gbps today and is likely to increase to over 100 Gbps as demonstrated in laboratory settings. In addition, Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) techniques, able to support over 160 wavelengths on a single optical fiber, have effectively increased the capacity of a single optical fiber to well over 1 Tbps. However, user requirements are often of a sub-wavelength order. This mis-match between individual user requirements and single wavelength offerings necessitates bandwidth sharing mechanisms to efficiently multiplex multiple low rate streams on to high rate wavelength channels, called traffic grooming.;This dissertation examines traffic grooming in the context of circuit, packet, burst and <b>trail</b> <b>switching</b> paradigms. Of primary interest are the Media Access Control (MAC) protocols used to provide QoS and fairness in optical networks. We present a comprehensive discussion of the most recognized fairness models and MACs for ring and bus networks which lay the groundwork for the development of the Robust, Dynamic and Fair Network (RDFN) protocol for ring networks. The RDFN protocol is a novel solution to fairly share ring bandwidth for bursty asynchronous data traffic while providing bandwidth and delay guarantees for synchronous voice traffic.;We explain the light-trail (LT) architecture and technology introduced in [37] as a solution to providing high network resource utilization, seamless scalability and network transparency for metropolitan area networks. The goal of light-trails is to eliminate Optical Electronic Optical (O-E-O) conversion, minimize active switching, maximize wavelength utilization, and offer protocol and bit-rate transparency to address the growing demands placed on WDM networks. Light-trail technology is a physical layer architecture that combines commercially available optical components to allow multiple nodes along a lightpath to participate in time multiplexed communication without the need for burst or packet level switch reconfiguration. We present three medium access control protocols for light-trails that provide collision protection but do not consider fair network access. As an improvement to these light-trail MAC protocols we introduce the Token LT and light-trail Fair Access (LT-FA) MAC protocols and evaluate their performance. We illustrate how fairness is achieved and access delay guarantees are made to satisfy the bandwidth budget fairness model. The goal of light-trails and our access control solution is to combine commercially available components with emerging network technologies to provide a transparent, reliable and highly scalable communication network.;The second area of discussion in this dissertation deals with the rapid prototyping platform. We discuss how the reconfigurable rapid prototyping platform (RRPP) is being utilized to bridge the gap between academic research, education and industry. We provide details of the Real-time Radon transform and the Griffin parallel computing platform implemented using the RRPP. We discuss how the RRPP provides additional visibility to academic research initiatives and facilitates understanding of system level designs. As a proof of concept, we introduce the light-trail testbed developed at the High Speed Systems Engineering lab. We discuss how a light-trail test bed has been developed using the RRPP to provide additional insight on the real-world limitations of light-trail technology. We provide details on its operation and discuss the steps required to and decisions made to realize test-bed operation. Two applications are presented to illustrate the use of the LT-FA MAC in the test-bed and demonstrate streaming media over light-trails.;As a whole, this dissertation aims to provide a comprehensive discussion of current and future technologies and trends for optical communication networks. In addition, we provide media access control solutions for ring and bus networks to address fair resource sharing and access delay guarantees. The light-trail testbed demonstrates proof of concept and outlines system level design challenges for future optical networks...|$|R

Using a randomized controlled design, twenty-eight adults (57 – 83 y old) meeting 2 -h tolerance test criteria for glucose intolerance completed 6 months of aerobic exercise or stretching, which served as the control. The primary cognitive outcomes included measures of executive function (<b>Trails</b> B, Task <b>Switching,</b> Stroop, Self-ordered Pointing Test, and Verbal Fluency). Other outcomes included memory performance (Story Recall, List Learning), measures of cardiorespiratory fitness obtained via maximal-graded exercise treadmill test, glucose disposal during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, body fat, and fasting plasma levels of insulin, cortisol, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, insulin-like growth factor- 1, amyloid-β (Aβ 40 and Aβ 42). Six months of aerobic exercise improved executive function (MANCOVA, p = 0. 04), cardiorespiratory fitness (MANOVA, p = 0. 03), and insulin sensitivity (p = 0. 05). Across all subjects, 6 -month changes in cardiorespiratory fitness and insulin sensitivity were positively correlated (p = 0. 01). For Aβ 42, plasma levels tended to decrease for the aerobic group relative to controls (p = 0. 07). The results of our study using rigorous controlled methodology suggest a cognition-enhancing effect of aerobic exercise for older glucose intolerant adults. Although replication in a larger sample is needed, our findings potentially have important therapeutic implications for a growing number of adults at increased risk of cognitive decline. ...|$|R
