40|$|SUMMARY The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to measure norepinephrine release during sympathetic nerve stimulation and evaluate the presynaptic inhibitory and facilitatory actions of a-adrenoceptor and / 3 -adrenoceptor agonists respectively, in the isolated perfused kidney of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Periarterial nerve stimulation (0. 25 to 32 Hz) caused a significantly greater release of norepinephrine, which was measured as total tritium overflow, in the SHR. The vasoconstrictor responses to periarterial nerve stimulation as well as to norepinephrine, angiotensin II, and barium chloride were also significantly greater in the SHR. Presynaptic actions of tramazoltne, an a 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, and salbutamol, a / 32 -adrenoceptor agonist, on norepinephrine release were determined during periarterial nerve stimulation at 2 Hz. <b>Tramazoline</b> (2 x 10 ~ 9 to 2 x 10 " 7 M) caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of stimulus-induced release of norepinephrine in SHR but not in WKY. While the highest concentration of <b>tramazoline</b> (2 x 10 " 7 M) exerted an inhibitory action in the WKY, this effect was of lesser magnitude than that seen in SHR. Salbutamol (10 ~ 10 to 10 ~ 6 M) produced an increase in norepinephrine release during periarterial nerve stimulation; however, this action of the / 3 -adrenoceptor agonist was similar in both the WKYand SHR. These results demonstrate that norepinephrine release during sympathetic nerve stimulation is significantly greater in the SHR, and this phenomenon may contribute to the maintenance of hypertension. While presynaptic / 3 -adrenoceptor function is similar in both the WKY and SHR, presynaptic a-adrenoceptors are supersensitive in the SHR. This supersensitivity may be of physiological importance in curtailing an already greater release of norepinephrine present in th...|$|E
40|$|We studied {{isolated}} canine {{arteries and}} veins {{to compare the}} pharmacological properties of their postjunctional alpha-adrenoceptors. Rings of femoral and splenic arteries and of femoral and saphenous veins were mounted for isometric tension recording in organ chambers filled with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution. The four blood vessels contracted when exposed to methoxamine, norepinephrine, phenylephrine, and tramazoline; clonidine failed to induce contraction only in the splenic artery. The relative sensitivity to methoxamine was comparable in the arteries and veins, but that for phenylephrine was larger in the former. The veins, but not the arteries, were more sensitive to clonidine and <b>tramazoline</b> than to phenylephrine or methoxamine. Phentolamine was a competitive antagonist against norepinephrine in the arteries and the veins. Prazosin was a competitive antagonist only in the arteries. The competitive antagonistic properties of yohimbine were more pronounced in the veins than in the arteries. Verapamil depressed {{to the same extent}} the contractile responses of saphenous veins to clonidine and norepinephrine, but reduced the contractions caused by methoxamine more than those due to norepinephrine. These results indicate the presence of both alpha 1 - and alpha 2 -like adrenoceptors on venous smooth muscle cells, whereas arterial smooth muscle cells contain mainly postjunctional alpha 1 -adrenoceptors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In this {{observational}} trial, {{data were}} collected on the effectiveness and tolerability/safety of a nasal spray containing <b>tramazoline</b> and essential oils (trade name Rhinospray((R)) Plus) used for symptomatic treatment of acute rhinitis due to common cold. METHODS: The trial was performed in 300 children, adolescents and adults, who were {{to be treated with}} Rhinospray((R)) Plus for up to 4 times per day for up to 10 days. Primary endpoints were the change from baseline to final visit in the mean of three single symptom scores (blocked nose, sneezing, and runny nose) and the mean improvement in two quality-of-life parameters (ability to perform normal daytime activities and quality of sleep). RESULTS: A total of 108 children, 30 adolescents and 162 adults were treated with Rhinospray((R)) Plus. No patient discontinued prematurely. There was a mean reduction of 2. 0 +/- 0. 6 (standard deviation) in nasal symptom scores from baseline to final visit; 297 of 300 of patients (99. 0 %) reported an improvement. The mean value for improvement in quality-of-life parameters was 1. 3 +/- 0. 5. Improvement in daytime activities was reported by all 300 patients (100. 0 %) and in quality of sleep by 292 patients (97. 4 %). Effectiveness and tolerability were rated as 'very good' or 'good' by 95. 4 % and 97. 4 % of patients, respectively; the investigators rated effectiveness and tolerability as 'very good' or 'good' for 97. 4 % and 100. 0 % of patients, respectively. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Community-based patients reported a relief in acute rhinitis symptoms and improvement in quality of life as a result of treatment with Rhinospray((R)) Plus. Treatment was well-tolerated...|$|E
