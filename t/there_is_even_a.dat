25|$|It {{is an open}} {{problem to}} prove the {{existence}} of a field extension of the rational field Q with a given finite group as Galois group. Hilbert played a part in solving the problem for all symmetric and alternating groups. Igor Shafarevich proved that every solvable finite group is the Galois group of some extension of Q. Various people have solved the inverse Galois problem for selected non-abelian simple groups. Existence of solutions has been shown for all but possibly one (Mathieu group M23) of the 26 sporadic simple groups. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> polynomial with integral coefficients whose Galois group is the Monster group.|$|E

They are common in areas not connected to sewers, but also exist in areas connected to sewers. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>even</b> <b>a</b> specific jōkasō law that regulates their construction, installation, inspection and desludging. Jōkasōs use different technologies and serve different sizes of buildings from single-family homes to high-rise buildings, public or commercial buildings.
