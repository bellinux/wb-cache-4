5|$|<b>Tellurium</b> and <b>tellurium</b> {{compounds}} {{are considered}} to be mildly toxic and need to be handled with care, although acute poisoning is rare. <b>Tellurium</b> poisoning is particularly difficult to treat as many chelation agents used in the treatment of metal poisoning will increase the toxicity of <b>tellurium.</b> <b>Tellurium</b> is not reported to be carcinogenic.|$|E
5|$|At higher {{temperatures}} <b>tellurium</b> {{is sufficiently}} plastic to extrude. It melts at 449.51°C. Crystalline <b>tellurium</b> has a structure consisting of parallel infinite spiral chains. The bonding between adjacent atoms {{in a chain}} is covalent, but {{there is evidence of}} a weak metallic interaction between the neighbouring atoms of different chains. <b>Tellurium</b> is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 1.0S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.32 to 0.38eV. Liquid <b>tellurium</b> is a semiconductor, with an electrical conductivity, on melting, of around 1.9 × 103S•cm−1. Superheated liquid <b>tellurium</b> is a metallic conductor.|$|E
5|$|Elemental <b>tellurium</b> is not {{considered}} particularly toxic; two grams of sodium tellurate, if administered, can be lethal. People exposed to small amounts of airborne <b>tellurium</b> exude a foul and persistent garlic-like odour. <b>Tellurium</b> dioxide {{has been used to}} treat seborrhoeic dermatitis; other <b>tellurium</b> compounds were used as antimicrobial agents before the development of antibiotics. In the future, such compounds may need to be substituted for antibiotics that have become ineffective due to bacterial resistance.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tellurium</b> has no {{biological}} function, although fungi {{can use it}} {{in place}} of sulfur and selenium in amino acids such as tellurocysteine and telluromethionine. In humans, <b>tellurium</b> is partly metabolized into dimethyl telluride, (CH3)2Te, a gas with a garlic-like odor exhaled in the breath of victims of <b>tellurium</b> exposure or poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>tellurium</b> {{is found}} with gold {{more often than}} in un{{combined}} form, it is found even more often combined as tellurides of more common metals (e.g. melonite, NiTe2). Natural tellurite and tellurate minerals also occur, formed by oxidation of tellurides near the Earth's surface. In contrast to selenium, <b>tellurium</b> does not usually replace sulfur in minerals because of the great difference in ion radii. Thus, many common sulfide minerals contain substantial quantities of selenium and only traces of <b>tellurium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Commercially, {{the primary}} use of <b>tellurium</b> is copper and steel alloys, where it {{improves}} machinability. Applications in CdTe solar panels and semiconductors also consume a considerable portion of <b>tellurium</b> production.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tellurium</b> {{compounds}} {{are used}} as pigments for ceramics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tellurium</b> has {{no known}} {{biological}} function, although fungi can incorporate {{it in place}} of sulfur and selenium into amino acids such as telluro-cysteine and telluro-methionine. Organisms have shown a highly variable tolerance to <b>tellurium</b> compounds. Many bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, take up tellurite and reduce it to elemental <b>tellurium,</b> which accumulates and causes a characteristic and often dramatic darkening of cells. In yeast, this reduction is mediated by the sulfate assimilation pathway. <b>Tellurium</b> accumulation seems to account for {{a major part of}} the toxicity effects. Many organisms also metabolize <b>tellurium</b> partly to form dimethyl telluride, although dimethyl ditelluride is also formed by some species. Dimethyl telluride has been observed in hot springs at very low concentrations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tellurium</b> {{is used in}} cadmium {{telluride}} (CdTe) solar panels. National Renewable Energy Laboratory lab tests of <b>tellurium</b> demonstrated {{some of the greatest}} efficiencies for solar cell electric power generators. Massive commercial production of CdTe solar panels by First Solar in recent years has significantly increased <b>tellurium</b> demand. Replacing some of the cadmium in CdTe by zinc, producing (Cd,Zn)Te, produces a solid-state X-ray detector, providing an alternative to single-use film badges.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tellurium,</b> as <b>tellurium</b> suboxide, {{is used in}} {{the media}} layer of rewritable optical discs, {{including}} ReWritable Compact Discs (CD-RW), ReWritable Digital Video Discs (DVD-RW), and ReWritable Blu-ray Discs.|$|E
5|$|The heavier {{metalloids}} {{continue the}} theme. Arsenic can form alloys with metals, including platinum and copper; {{it is also}} added to copper and its alloys to improve corrosion resistance and appears to confer the same benefit when added to magnesium. Antimony is well known as an alloy-former, including with the coinage metals. Its alloys include pewter (a tin alloy with up to 20% antimony) and type metal (a lead alloy with up to 25% antimony). <b>Tellurium</b> readily alloys with iron, as ferrotellurium (50–58% <b>tellurium),</b> and with copper, {{in the form of}} copper <b>tellurium</b> (40–50% <b>tellurium).</b> Ferrotellurium is used as a stabilizer for carbon in steel casting. Of the non-metallic elements less often recognised as metalloids, selenium—in the form of ferroselenium (50–58% selenium)—is used to improve the machinability of stainless steels.|$|E
5|$|Boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and <b>tellurium</b> are {{recognised}} commonly as metalloids. Depending on the author, one or {{more from}} selenium, polonium, or astatine are sometimes added to the list. Boron sometimes is excluded, by itself, or with silicon. Sometimes <b>tellurium</b> is not regarded as a metalloid. The inclusion of antimony, polonium, and astatine as metalloids also has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{sensitive}} {{semiconductor material}} is formed by alloying <b>tellurium</b> with cadmium and mercury to form mercury cadmium telluride.|$|E
5|$|Mixtures of {{selenium}} and <b>tellurium</b> {{are used}} with barium peroxide as an oxidizer in the delay powder of electric blasting caps.|$|E
5|$|Rubber can be {{vulcanized}} with <b>tellurium</b> {{instead of}} sulfur or selenium. The rubber produced {{in this way}} shows improved heat resistance.|$|E
5|$|Selenium, and {{possibly}} boron, silicon, arsenic and <b>tellurium,</b> plus the organogen elements are sometimes categorized together as other nonmetals, as they fall outside the halogens and noble gases. The first {{five of these}} (Se; B, Si, As, Te) differ from the organogens: none are universally required for life; arsenic is notoriously poisonous; and <b>tellurium</b> hydride is a fairly strong, rather than weak, acidic hydride.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tellurium</b> dioxide is used {{to create}} acousto-optic {{modulators}} (AOTFs and AOBSs) for confocal microscropy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tellurium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbolTe and atomic number52. It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid. <b>Tellurium</b> is chemically related to selenium and sulfur. It is occasionally found in native form as elemental crystals. <b>Tellurium</b> {{is far more}} common in the universe as a whole than on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of platinum, is due partly to its high atomic number, but also to its formation of a volatile hydride which caused it to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of the planet.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tellurium</b> {{is a key}} {{constituent}} of high performing {{mixed oxide}} catalysts for the heterogeneous catalytic selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid. The surface elemental composition changes dynamically and reversibly with the reaction conditions. In the presence of steam {{the surface of the}} catalyst is enriched in <b>tellurium</b> and vanadium which translates into the enhancement of the acrylic acid production.|$|E
5|$|The {{atomic mass}} of <b>tellurium</b> (127.60g·mol−1) exceeds that of iodine (126.90g·mol−1), the next {{element in the}} {{periodic}} table.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{consumer}} of <b>tellurium</b> is metallurgy in iron, stainless steel, copper, and lead alloys. The addition to steel and copper produces an alloy more machinable than otherwise. It is alloyed into cast iron for promoting chill for spectroscopy, where {{the presence of}} electrically conductive free graphite tends to interfere with spark emission testing results. In lead, <b>tellurium</b> improves strength and durability, and decreases the corrosive action of sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|Neutron {{bombardment}} of <b>tellurium</b> {{is the most}} common way to produce iodine-131. This in turn is used to treat some thyroid conditions, and as a tracer compound in hydraulic fracturing, among other applications.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tellurium</b> {{adopts a}} {{polymeric}} structure consisting of zig-zag chains of Te atoms. This gray material resists oxidation by air {{and is not}} volatile.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tellurium</b> is a silvery-white shiny solid. It has a {{density of}} 6.24 g/cm3, is brittle, {{and is the}} softest of the {{commonly}} recognised metalloids, being marginally harder than sulfur. Large pieces of <b>tellurium</b> are stable in air. The finely powdered form is oxidized by air {{in the presence of}} moisture. <b>Tellurium</b> reacts with boiling water, or when freshly precipitated even at 50°C, to give the dioxide and hydrogen: Te + 2 H2O → TeO2 + 2 H2. It reacts (to varying degrees) with nitric, sulfuric and hydrochloric acids to give compounds such as the sulfoxide TeSO3 or tellurous acid H2TeO3, the basic nitrate (Te2O4H)+(NO3)−, or the oxide sulfate Te2O3(SO4). It dissolves in boiling alkalis, to give the tellurite and telluride: 3 Te + 6 KOH = K2TeO3 + 2 K2Te + 3 H2O, a reaction that proceeds or is reversible with increasing or decreasing temperature.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tellurium</b> is {{produced}} {{mainly in the}} United States, Peru, Japan and Canada. The British Geological Survey gives the following production numbers for 2009: United States 50t, Peru 7t, Japan 40t and Canada 16t.|$|E
5|$|The 1960s {{brought an}} {{increase}} in thermoelectric applications for <b>tellurium</b> (as bismuth telluride), and in free-machining steel alloys, which became the dominant use.|$|E
5|$|The metal is {{produced}} from the oxide (reduced) either by electrolysis or by reacting the <b>tellurium</b> dioxide with sulfur dioxide in sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|Shive held several patents {{including}} Selenium rectifier {{and method}} of making it, Directly heated thermocouple, Photoresistive translating device, Selenium rectifier including <b>tellurium</b> and method of making it, Apparatus for and method of treating selenium rectifiers, Semiconductor photoelectric device, Conditioning of semiconductor translators, Semiconductor amplifier, and Alternating gate current.|$|E
5|$|Tellurites can be leached {{from the}} mixture {{with water and}} are {{normally}} present as hydrotellurites HTeO3− in solution. Selenites are also formed during this process, {{but they can be}} separated by adding sulfuric acid. The hydrotellurites are converted into the insoluble <b>tellurium</b> dioxide while the selenites stay in solution.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tellurium</b> {{does not}} readily form analogues of {{alcohols}} and thiols, with the functional group –TeH, that are called tellurols. The –TeH functional group is also attributed using the prefix tellanyl-. Like H2Te, these species are unstable {{with respect to}} loss of hydrogen. Telluraethers (R–Te–R) are more stable, as are telluroxides.|$|E
5|$|The {{workability}} and {{corrosion resistance}} {{of iron and}} chromium are increased by adding gadolinium; the creep resistance of nickel is improved {{with the addition of}} thorium. <b>Tellurium</b> is added to copper and steel alloys to improve their machinability; and to lead to make it harder and more acid-resistant.|$|E
5|$|Among other achievements, Bachelder {{developed}} {{methods for}} the purification {{of the rare}} elements <b>tellurium</b> and indium. Other aspects of her broad scientific expertise found application {{in the field of}} marine archaeology, when she determined the chemical composition of brass cannons found in the Aegean Sea on sunken ships. She also made contributions to astrochemistry, when NASA asked her to analyze the chemistry of Moon rocks which had been collected from the Moon's surface during the Apollo missions from 1969 to 1972.|$|E
5|$|Carbon, aluminium, {{phosphorus}} and selenium {{continue the}} theme. Carbon, in black powder, is a constituent of fireworks rocket propellants, bursting charges, and effects mixtures, and military delay fuses and igniters. Aluminium {{is a common}} pyrotechnic ingredient, and is widely employed for its capacity to generate light and heat, including in thermite mixtures. Phosphorus {{can be found in}} smoke and incendiary munitions, paper caps used in toy guns, and party poppers. Selenium has been used {{in the same way as}} <b>tellurium.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, it is a p-block transactinide element. It {{is a member}} of the 7th period and is placed in group 16 as the heaviest chalcogen, although it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier homologue to the chalcogen polonium. Livermorium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues (oxygen, sulfur, selenium, <b>tellurium,</b> and polonium), and be a post-transition metal, although it should also show several major differences from them.|$|E
5|$|Organotellurium {{compounds}} such as dimethyl telluride, diethyl telluride, diisopropyl telluride, diallyl telluride and methyl allyl telluride are {{precursors for}} synthesizing metalorganic {{vapor phase epitaxy}} growth of II-VI compound semiconductors. Diisopropyl telluride (DIPTe) is the preferred precursor for low-temperature growth of CdHgTe by MOVPE. The greatest purity metalorganics of both selenium and <b>tellurium</b> are used in these processes. The compounds for semiconductor industry and are prepared by adduct purification.|$|E
5|$|Sulfides, selenides and tellurides of curium {{have been}} {{obtained}} by treating curium with gaseous sulfur, selenium or <b>tellurium</b> in vacuum at elevated temperature. The pnictides of curium of the type CmX are known for the elements nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic and antimony. They can be prepared by reacting either curium(III) hydride (CmH3) or metallic curium with these elements at elevated temperatures.|$|E
