5|$|Most playwrights of {{the period}} {{typically}} collaborated with others at some point, and critics agree that Shakespeare did the same, mostly early and late in his career. Some attributions, such as Titus Andronicus and the early history plays, remain controversial while The Two Noble Kinsmen and the lost Cardenio have well-attested contemporary documentation. Textual evidence also supports the view <b>that</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plays were revised by other writers after their original composition.|$|E

5|$|Before commencing {{the designs}} for the {{characters}} in Devil May Cry 4, character designer Tatsuya Yoshikawa consulted with {{several members of the}} staff that had worked in the series previously, in order to become familiar with previous elements. The characters were designed in order to emphasize their moves, which made the staff controlling their motions vital in the design. Some of the demonic forms of the antagonists in Devil May Cry 4 resemble angels. These characters were designed to be attractive to the game's audience while providing a contrast when compared to other demons in the game. Yoshikawa noted <b>that</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boss characters presented some difficulty when creating them, but that Nero's design {{was one of the biggest}} challenges he had experienced in his career, based on the fact that the character would have to be accepted by the public and fit in the series' universe.|$|E

Von der Tann was without her main battery for 11hours, although three turrets were restored to working order {{before the end of the}} battle; Dturret only after much cutting away of bent metal with oxyacetylene torches—afterwards the guns could be worked only by hand. Her casualties amounted to 11 dead and 35 wounded. During the battle Von der Tann fired 170 heavy shells and 98 secondary caliber shells.|$|E
5|$|No African American {{was awarded}} a Medal of Honor either during World War II or {{immediately}} afterwards {{with respect to their}} actions during that conflict. This changed in 1992 when a study conducted by Shaw University and commissioned by the U.S. Dept. of Defense and the United States Army asserted that systematic racial discrimination had been present in the criteria for awarding medals during the war. After an exhaustive review of files the study recommended <b>that</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Distinguished Service Crosses awarded to African Americans be upgraded to the Medal of Honor. On January 13, 1997, more than fifty {{years after the end of}} the war, President Bill Clinton awarded the Medal to seven African American World War II veterans.

5|$|Reviewers were {{consistent}} in their praises and {{criticism of the}} album.

5|$|Reviews of {{the soundtrack}} album were positive, with critics praising both {{the variety of}} styles {{and quality of the}} pieces.

Critics were also mixed in their opinions of the arranged album, feeling <b>that</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pieces were simply inferior versions of the original tracks. Both of the albums and the single sold well enough to place on the Japanese Oricon charts, with the original soundtrack album reaching a peak of #13 and remaining on the charts for eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|In 2004 the Public Roads Administration {{published}} a report documenting high administration {{costs in the}} 46 toll companies throughout the country. Along with the company for the Osterøy Bridge, SBT received the harshest criticism in the report. Especially a trip made by Chairman Harry Herstad and his wife to San Francisco to participate at a conference was criticized, as it cost the toll company NOK118,000. Also annual board member fees of NOK200,000 and excessive trips for the board were commented as wasted money. The internal audit concluded with that there were costs of NOK300,000 in 2002 and 2003 which were not properly documented or were not used in line with regulations. The report {{was rejected by the}} board, who claimed <b>that</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> issues were misunderstandings and that the Public Roads Administration was using the report in a campaign to establish a state-run toll collection agency.

5|$|Olivia {{agrees to}} bring Lincoln onto the case, and shows {{him that there}} have been roughly thirty victims in the last several days, who have had no obvious {{connection}} or signs of death, other than that their hearts stopped. Lincoln reveals that Danzig suffered from Crohn's disease and was taking iron supplements, which leads Walter (John Noble) to realize that all of the victims were suffering from heavy metal poisoning, and that their killer extracted substances from their blood. Recognizing <b>that</b> <b>several</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victims use commuter rail, Olivia initiates a manhunt at a nearby rail station. She and her team are then informed of the suspect's location, and after a chase, in which one of the pursuing FBI agents is killed and another shot in the leg, Olivia is able to kill the suspect, who also had translucent skin and had been experimenting on himself. Lincoln kills a second man with the same condition. As the FBI cleans up the area, a woman (Michelle Krusiec), also with translucent skin, watches from afar.|$|E
