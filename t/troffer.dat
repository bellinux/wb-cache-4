2500|$|To {{prepare for}} the Niagara event, Wallenda practiced {{in the parking lot}} of Seneca Niagara Casino for eleven {{straight}} days. He had fire trucks spray him with water and brought in a high-powered fan to try to simulate the conditions he would face over Niagara Falls. Practices were open to the public. [...] Wallenda's safety coordinator and father, Terry <b>Troffer,</b> said the training was primarily mental. [...] "This is a mental game. It's convincing himself that... it's just a different location," [...] <b>Troffer</b> explained.|$|E
2500|$|Nik Wallenda {{was born}} in Sarasota, Florida, on January 24, 1979, to Delilah Wallenda and Terry <b>Troffer.</b> At age two, his parents bought him a swing set. [...] Before <b>Troffer</b> had even {{finished}} assembling it, Wallenda climbed up to the crossbar and did a somersault. [...] "And he did it perfectly," [...] <b>Troffer</b> recalls. [...] "I didn't teach him that." [...] Around the same time, he began performing {{with his family in}} their circus act. Wallenda's first public performance, dressed as a clown, was at SeaWorld San Diego in 1981. [...] He began to play on the wire at age two, walking back and forth while holding his mother's hand. At age four, he starting walking the wire on his own, learning primarily from his father. As a child, he would play on his parent's practice wire with his older sister Lijana, two feet (0.6 m) off the ground. [...] Wallenda's parents would throw objects at him as he practiced, and even shot him with a BB gun, to train him to deal with distractions. At age six, he first visited Niagara Falls and immediately decided that one day he wanted to walk a tightrope across it. [...] He spent most of his youth on the road, living in a mobile home as his parents performed across America. [...] However, Wallenda says there was never any family pressure to become a circus performer.|$|E
2500|$|To {{make the}} walk {{accessible}} to viewers worldwide, {{it was held}} after dark, with the first step coming at 10:16p.m. local time (02:16 June 16 UTC). [...] The time was also advantageous to Wallenda, as half {{of the volume of}} water going over the Falls is diverted for power generation purposes after dusk. Wallenda wore a microphone for the event which allowed <b>Troffer</b> to talk with him, while the public listened in, throughout the walk.|$|E
40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) Commercially Available LED Product Evaluation and Reporting (CALiPER) Program was {{established}} in 2006 to investigate the performance of light-emitting diode (LED) based luminaires and replacement lamps. To help users better compare LED products with conventional lighting technologies, CALiPER has also performed benchmark research and testing of traditional (i. e., non-LED) lamps and fixtures. This benchmark report addresses standard 4 -foot fluorescent lamps (i. e., T 12 and T 8) and the 2 -foot by 4 -foot recessed <b>troffers</b> {{in which they are}} commonly used. This report also examines available LED replacements for T 12 and T 8 fluorescent lamps, and their application in fluorescent <b>troffers.</b> The construction and operation of linear fluorescent lamps and <b>troffers</b> are discussed, as well as fluorescent lamp and fixture performance, based on manufacturer data and CALiPER benchmark testing. In addition, the report describes LED replacements for linear fluorescent lamps, and compares their bare lamp and in situ performance with fluorescent benchmarks on a range of standard lighting measures, including power usage, light output and distribution, efficacy, correlated color temperature, and the color rendering index. Potential performance and application issues indicated by CALiPER testing results are also examined...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{simulations}} of lighting and HVAC energy consumption {{were performed on}} a prototype office building in six North American climates. The goal of these simulations was to calculate the overall energy savings attributable to reductions in lighting power density (LPD) from 25. 8 W/m (past practice) to 17. 2 W/m (current code) to 8. 6 W/m (low). Results showed that as LPD decreases, reductions in cooling energy, due to reductions in heat produced by lighting, could substantially increase cost savings over the cost savings attributable to lighting in isolation, particularly in warm climates. Further, nine different lighting designs were installed in a windowless, 83 m), mock-up open-plan office space, containing six workstations. The nine lighting designs resulted {{from a combination of}} the three LPDs used in the simulations, created using three ambient lighting technologies (recessed <b>troffers</b> with prismatic lenses; recessed <b>troffers</b> with parabolic louvers; indirect or direct/indirect fixtures); in the low lighting power density options, the ambient lighting systems were supplemented with task lighting. At least thirty participants, in groups of three to six, worked for a full day under one design (292 participants in total). They performed a variety of computer-based and paper-based tasks designed to be representative of modern office work, and completed questionnaires to assess satisfaction and impressions of lighting quality. Ratings of environmental satisfaction, lighting quality, task difficulty, and self-reported productivity indicated that participants preferred parabolic louver fixtures over prismatic lens fixtures, and preferred the low energy lighting designs...|$|R
40|$|The {{adoption}} of energy efficiency measures in building codes places constraints on lighting designers that they fear {{will reduce the}} quality of the lit environment. This experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that lighting quality, as understood by lighting designers, affects the task performance, mood, comfort, health, and aesthetic judgements of office workers. Nine lighting systems were installed in a windowless, 83 m), open-plan office space containing six workstations. The designs combined three levels of lighting power density (LPD) and three levels of Designers' Lighting Quality (DLQ) (recessed <b>troffers</b> with prismatic lenses; recessed <b>troffers</b> with parabolic louvers; indirect or direct/indirect fixtures). In the low LPD options, the ambient lighting systems were supplemented with task lighting. Temporary office workers (292 in total) each worked for one day under one of the nine lighting conditions. In addition to morning and afternoon visual performance tests, they performed a variety of computer-based and paper-based tasks designed to be representative of modern office work, and completed questionnaires to assess satisfaction and impressions of lighting quality, mood, physical comfort, and social behaviours. The results show that energy-efficient lighting and good-quality lighting can be compatible. For computer-based work, under existing lighting power density limits, parabolic-louvered luminaires provide better verbal-intellectual and clerical task performance than recessed lensed luminaires. Verbal-intellectual task performance and visual performance were better under electronic ballasts than magnetic ballasts, regardless of lighting system.

30|$|It {{should be}} {{understood}} {{that the use of}} 4 in × 4 in luminous panels and the layouts of the panels were for clarity and simplicity in demonstrating the fundamental principle of this study and not as practical implementations. In specific, the panels on the ceiling plane could be regarded as having an equivalent lighting effect as that of general lighting luminaires such as 2  ft × 4  ft <b>troffers</b> or indirect lighting. The panels for task lighting layer was a representation of one or more task lighting luminaires capable of delivering even illumination across the entire task surface on the 4  ft diameter desktop. The choice of Task Lighting Layer at 6 in. above the work surface was to ensure that substantially all the light will reach the task surface. The study chose an array of panels mounted at 3.5  ft height within the personal space to represent Surround Lighting layer because it was a simple way to distribute the light consistently over the entire volume of the personal space. Other layouts could be possible such as putting the surround light at a lower height and even {{on one side of the}} table for as long as the light could fill the entire volume of space. Finally, the luminous panels for surround light were considered as physical entities with 50  % reflectance while task lighting layer was treated as photometric entities only with no light blockage.|$|R
40|$|In this project, an {{integrated}} warm-white hybrid light engine was developed. The hybrid approach involves combining phosphor-converted off-white InGaN LEDs and direct-emitting red AlInGaP LEDs {{in a single}} light engine to achieve high efficacy together with high color rendering index. We developed and integrated technology improvements in InGaN and AlInGaP die technology, phosphor technology, package architecture and encapsulation, to realize a hybrid warm-white LED package with an efficacy of 140 lm/W at a correlated color temperature of 3000 K and a color rendering index of 90, measured under representative operating conditions. This efficacy is 26 % higher than the best warm-white LEDs of similar specification that are commercially available {{at the end of}} the project. Since the InGaN- and AlInGaP-based LEDs used in the hybrid engine show different behavior as a function of current and temperature, a control system needs to be in place to ensure a stable color point over all operating conditions. In this project, we developed an electronic control circuit that is fully integrated into the light engine in such a way that the module can simply be driven by a conventional single-channel driver. The integrated control circuit uses a switch-mode boost converter topology to control the LED drive currents based on the temperature and the input current of the light engine. A color control performance of 5 SDCM was demonstrated, and improvement to 3 SDCM is considered well within reach. The combination of high efficacy and ease of integration with existing single-channel drivers is expected to facilitate the adoption of the hybrid technology and accelerate the energy savings associated with solid-state lighting. In the product commercialization plan, downlights and indirect-lit <b>troffers</b> have been selected as the first target applications for this product concept. Fully functional integrated prototypes have been developed for both applications, and the business case evaluation is ongoing as of the end of the project...|$|R

40|$|LED {{retrofit}} kits and linear replacement lamps are {{now available}} to convert recessed fluorescent light fixtures (or ‘troffers’) in commercial buildings such as offices and retail. These retrofits re-use the top portion of the existing <b>troffer,</b> so the space above the dropped ceiling is not disturbed. Compared to complete <b>troffer</b> replacement, LED retrofits can usually be installed more quickly, with less dust and disturbance of the occupants. Two types of retrofits are available. LED linear replacement lamps are shaped like fluorescent lamps. They reuse the existing lens, and often the existing lamp holders. Integrated-style LED retrofit kits are not shaped like fluorescent lamps. Some reuse the existing lens, while others provide a new customized lens, to enhance appearance and light distribution. Note that besides LED kits, energy efficient kits with new customized lenses are also available with new fluorescent HPT 8 ’s.
