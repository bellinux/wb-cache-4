Pseudouridine (Ψ), in which <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> <b>between</b> uracil and ribose is changed from a C–N bond to a C–C bond, and ribothymidine (T) are found in various places (the most notable ones being in the TΨC loop of tRNA). Another notable modified base is hypoxanthine, a deaminated adenine base whose nucleoside is called inosine (I). Inosine {{plays a key role}} in the wobble hypothesis of the genetic code.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecology of}} global carbon budgets gives {{one example of}} <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> <b>between</b> {{biodiversity}} and biogeochemistry. It is estimated that the Earth's oceans hold 40,000 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, that vegetation and soil hold 2070 Gt, and that fossil fuel emissions are 6.3 Gt carbon per year. There have been major restructurings in these global carbon budgets during the Earth's history, regulated {{to a large extent}} by the ecology of the land. For example, through the early-mid Eocene volcanic outgassing, the oxidation of methane stored in wetlands, and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO2 (carbon dioxide) concentrations to levels as high as 3500ppm.|$|E

25|$|Despite the difficulties, {{analysis}} of ice core and ocean sediment cores has shown periods of glacials and interglacials {{over the past}} few million years. These also confirm <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> <b>between</b> ice ages and continental crust phenomena such as glacial moraines, drumlins, and glacial erratics. Hence the continental crust phenomena are accepted as good evidence of earlier ice ages when they are found in layers created much earlier than the time range for which ice cores and ocean sediment cores are available.|$|E
25|$|In {{the process}} {{described}} above, {{the fact that}} the first hypercycles originated from the quasispecies population (a population of similar sequences) created a significant advantage. One possibility of linking different chains I—which is relatively easy to achieve taking into account the quasispecies properties—is that the one chain I improves the synthesis of the similar chain I. In this way, the existence of similar sequences I originating from the same quasispecies population promotes the creation of <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> <b>between</b> molecules I and I.|$|E
25|$|Another {{difficulty}} with antagonistic pleiotropy and other theories that suppose that ageing is an adverse {{side effect of}} some beneficial function is that <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> <b>between</b> adverse and beneficial effects {{would need to be}} rigid {{in the sense that the}} evolution process would not be able to evolve a way to accomplish the benefit without incurring the adverse effect even over a very long time span. Such a rigid relationship has not been experimentally demonstrated and, in general, evolution is able to independently and individually adjust myriad organism characteristics.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} two years, the {{competing}} archbishops fought to a standstill. Both had external help: Ernst's oldest brother, Wilhelm V, Duke of Bavaria provided soldiers and funds, and his second eldest brother, Ferdinand, commanded the small army in his name, and Gebhard's brother, Karl Truchsess von Waldburg and several Protestant supporters within the Electorate provided both soldiers and funds. In the immediate months of the war's outbreak, the Oberstift campaign resulted in Gebhard's loss of several important cities and citadels, which eventually changed hands {{several times in the}} course of the war. In the 1585–86 campaigns, Dutch, Flemish and English mercenaries had augmented his force, but he never attracted significant support from the other German princes, principally because he was a Calvinist and they were Lutherans. The Dutch had offered moderate help, recognizing <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> <b>between</b> his cause and their own independence from Catholic Spain. Conversely, Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma and commander of Philip II of Spain's army in Flanders also recognized <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> <b>between</b> Ernst's cause and his own. A series of Catholic bridgeheads on the Rhine would enable him to move his troops more easily around several of the strongholds opposing the re-establishment of Spanish control in the Netherlands. In 1585nbsp&and 1587, Ernst won several important victories, principally through the efforts of the Duke of Parma's army, and several of the German-Catholic counts, such as Karl von Mansfeld.|$|E
25|$|The LOD score (logarithm (base 10) of odds), {{developed}} by Newton Morton, is a statistical test {{often used for}} linkage analysis in human, animal, and plant populations. The LOD score compares the likelihood of obtaining the test data if the two loci are indeed linked, to the likelihood of observing the same data purely by chance. Positive LOD scores favour the presence of linkage, whereas negative LOD scores indicate that linkage is less likely. Computerised LOD score analysis is {{a simple way to}} analyse complex family pedigrees in order to determine <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> <b>between</b> Mendelian traits (or between a trait and a marker, or two markers).|$|E
25|$|This was {{designed}} in late 1916 {{and took the}} form of a new synchronization gear without any rods at all. The cam that generated the firing impulses was moved from the engine to the gun itself; the trigger motor in effect now generated its own firing impulses. <b>The</b> <b>linkage</b> <b>between</b> the propeller and the gun now consisted of a flexible drive shaft directly connecting the end of the engine camshaft to the trigger motor of the gun. The firing button for the gun simply engaged a clutch at the engine which set the flexible drive (and thus the trigger motor) in motion. In some ways this brought the new gear closer to the original Schneider patent (q.v.).|$|E

25|$|In bulked {{segregant}} analysis, {{a population}} is screened for a trait of interest and the genotypes at the two extreme ends form two bulks. Then the two bulks are tested for {{the presence or absence}} of molecular markers. Since the bulks are supposed to contrast in the alleles that contribute positive and negative effects, any marker polymorphism between the two bulks indicates <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> <b>between</b> the marker and trait of interest. BSA is dependent on accurate phenotyping and the DH population has particular advantage in that they are true breeding and can be tested repeatedly. DH populations are commonly used in bulked segregant analysis, which is a popular method in marker assisted breeding. This method has been applied mostly to rapeseed and barley.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{research}} regarding the effects of linguistic profiling relates to housing. A study at the University of Pennsylvania found that discrepancies existed not only between white speakers of Standard American English and black speakers of African American Vernacular English, but in addition in between females and males and speakers of Black Accented English and African American Vernacular English when applying for housing. African Americans as a whole {{were also more likely}} to be told about the problems of creditworthiness when applying for a lease.

25|$|The Bhopal medical {{community}} {{was faced with}} 1) the urgent health care needs of the affected community, 2) the non-availability of toxicological and accident-related information, 3) the extreme sensitivity of local and national government bodies toward {{all aspects of the}} disaster, 4) lack of expertise, and 5) the lack of funds available to independent researchers to conduct investigations. Faced with lawsuits and the prospect of bankruptcy, Union Carbide’s efforts to keep open channels of communication were highly inadequate to address these issues and were {{considered by many to be}} a major human rights violation. In addition, the transnational political and legal ramifications served to throw a veil of secrecy around the disaster, thus impeding the discovery of essential pieces of information. Medical, toxicological, and accident-analysis data were not made public, thereby frustrating the efforts of the {{medical community}} to understand <b>the</b> <b>linkage</b> <b>between</b> exposures and health effects and devise appropriate treatment strategies. As an example, the lack of information about whether MIC could thermally decompose to hydrocyanic acid led to years of contentious debate on the merits of treating the gas victims for cyanide poisoning and an unfortunate violation of patient confidentiality.|$|E
