The film was released in the United States and Canada in October 1998 to mixed reviews and made under $9 million. The main actors won several minor awards for their performances.|$|E
5|$|By 17 December the {{situation}} in Java had worsened, and the brigade was moved again, sent as reinforcements to assist the Indian division. They arrived at Batavia three days later. The brigade's mission was to restore law and order and disarm the Japanese military forces in the area. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> expect to remain in Java until relieved by units of the Royal Netherlands Army. Under the command of the 23rd Indian Infantry Division, the brigade carried out Operation Pounce, clearing the town and surrounding region of dissidents. In January 1946 they were moved to garrison Semarang.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the battle}} at Stillman's Run, Black Hawk's grand vision of British support, and a Native American confederacy had collapsed. No parties aided him and his followers. The British Band started to weaken with hunger, and Black Hawk soon {{realized}} that the only option was to return across the Mississippi River. When he detected the U.S. militia camp eight miles (13km) away, Black Hawk sent out peace envoys in order to negotiate a truce. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> wave a white flag at the militia.|$|E

5|$|Evans {{appeared}} in four (out of five) Beatles' films. During {{the filming of}} the Beatles' first feature film, A Hard Day's Night, Evans {{appeared in}} a cameo role, carrying an upright bass in between John Lennon and Millie in the backstage scene in which Millie mistakes Lennon for someone else. In Help!, Evans played a confused channel swimmer who pops up through an ice-hole in Austria, and {{on a beach in}} the Bahamas. Evans and Aspinall were asked to find and hire the actors that were needed to perform in the Magical Mystery Tour film, and to hire an old 60-seater coach, on which <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> paint the Magical Mystery Tour logo, which McCartney had designed. Evans later appeared in the film as one of the magicians, who cast mysterious spells on the passengers of the bus.|$|E
5|$|Gil {{started to}} play music {{as a child and}} was still a {{teenager}} when he joined his first band. He {{began his career as a}} bossa nova musician, and then grew to write songs that reflected a focus on political awareness and social activism. He was a key figure in the Música popular brasileira and tropicália movements of the 1960s, alongside artists such as longtime collaborator Caetano Veloso. The Brazilian military regime that took power in 1964 saw both Gil and Veloso as a threat, and the two were held for nine months in 1969 before <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> leave the country. Gil moved to London, but returned to Bahia in 1972 and continued his musical career, as well as working as a politician and environmental advocate.|$|E
5|$|In {{a letter}} dated 24 September 1554, Knox {{received}} {{an invitation from}} a congregation of English exiles in Frankfurt {{to become one of}} their ministers. He accepted the call with Calvin's blessing. But no sooner had he arrived than he found himself in a conflict. The first set of refugees to arrive in Frankfurt had subscribed to a reformed liturgy and used {{a modified version of the}} Book of Common Prayer. More recently arrived refugees, however, including Edmund Grindal, the future Archbishop of Canterbury, favoured a stricter application of the book. When Knox and a supporting colleague, William Whittingham, wrote to Calvin for advice, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> avoid contention. Knox therefore agreed on a temporary order of service based on a compromise between the two sides. This delicate balance was disturbed when a new batch of refugees arrived that included Richard Cox, one of the principal authors of the Book of Common Prayer. Cox brought Knox's pamphlet attacking the emperor to the attention of the Frankfurt authorities, who advised that Knox leave. His departure from Frankfurt on 26 March 1555 marked his final breach with the Church of England.|$|E

50|$|Forward {{chaining}} {{would teach}} the subject first to insert the key. Once that task <b>is</b> mastered, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> insert the key, and taught to turn it. Once that task <b>is</b> mastered, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> perform the first two, then taught {{to open the}} door. Backwards chaining would involve the teacher first inserting and turning the key, and the subject then being taught to open the door. Once that is learned, the teacher inserts the key, and the subject is taught to turn it, then opens the door as the next step. Finally, the subject is taught to insert the key, and they turn and open the door. Once {{the first step is}} mastered, the entire task has been taught. Total task chaining would involve teaching the entire task as a single series, prompting through all steps. Prompts are faded (reduced) at each step as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> mastered.|$|R
25|$|At 11:30 pm on {{the night}} of 27–28 January 1919, guards awoke Nicholas Mikhailovich, his brother George and his cousin Dimitri in their cells at Shpalernaya prison, telling them they were to be moved and had to pack their belongings. They {{initially}} assumed {{that they were going to}} be transported to Moscow. Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich even thought that they might be set free, but his brother assumed that they were heading to another place to be shot. They had an ominous hint of what was going to happen to them when at the time of departure <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> leave their luggage.|$|E
25|$|Women {{moving out}} of the Victorian era and into the Edwardian era were {{starting}} to dress for a more active lifestyle. The evolving times brought a new fashion trend known as the “New Woman”. Active lives required less constricting clothing and required simpler and more streamlined clothing. The new woman was highly encouraged by women’s suffrage. Women that identified with this fashion movement were the type of women that were beginning to venture out of the domestic circle that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> maintain and beginning to pursue higher education, office jobs, and participating in active outdoor sports. The new and improved fashions allowed for women to swing a tennis racket, whack a golf ball, but the ideas of “proper” feminine attire reduced the progress of more practical sportswear.|$|E
25|$|Spock {{advocated}} {{ideas about}} parenting that were, at the time, considered {{out of the}} mainstream. Over time, his books helped to bring about major change. Previously, experts had told parents that babies needed to learn to sleep on a regular schedule, and that picking them up and holding them whenever they cried would only teach them to cry more and not to {{sleep through the night}} (a notion that borrows from behaviorism). <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> feed their children on a regular schedule, and that they should not pick them up, kiss them, or hug them, because that would not prepare them to be strong and independent individuals in a harsh world. In contrast Spock encouraged parents to see their children as individuals, and not to apply a one-size-fits all philosophy to them.|$|E

25|$|The Grand Dukes {{were loaded}} into a truck that already held four common criminals and six Red Guardsmen. At 1:20 am on 28 January, {{they left the}} prison. They drove towards the river by the Field of Mars, where the truck stalled. While the driver was trying to restart it, one of the convicts tried to run and {{was shot in the}} back as he fled. The truck {{eventually}} began running again, and they drove to the Peter and Paul Fortress. The prisoners were roughly pushed from the truck into the Trubetskoy bastion. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> remove their shirts and coats, {{despite the fact that it}} was almost 20 degrees below zero.

25|$|As Władysław IV {{carried out}} {{preparations}} for the Turkish expedition that he had planned, {{by the time the}} Sejm halted the undertaking, large numbers of Cossack warriors had been mobilized and put in a state of military readiness. The appearance of an outstanding leader, a scribe in the Zaporizhian Army of Registered Cossacks, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, was another decisive factor. Having suffered a wrong from Daniel Czapliński, a Polish nobleman, and unable to obtain redress through official channels, Khmelnytsky headed for the Zaporizhian Sich, where he agitated among the Cossacks already embittered by the repressions of the 1630s, and now also made restless by the cancellation of the war <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> expect. Khmelnytsky effectively caused the Cossack force to change sides. He was able to secure support from the Crimean Khanate, taking advantage of the Tatars' (and their Ottoman overlords') interest in disabling the Commonwealth's offensive military capabilities. The Cossack-Tatar alliance, a new factor in the regional civil warfare, turned out to be militarily highly effective.|$|E
500|$|The platoon {{consisted}} of two nine-man reconnaissance squads and a seven-man headquarters section, which {{was attached to the}} 394th regimental S2 section. As the platoon was not intended, nor trained, for combat, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> avoid direct engagement with the Germans. Nonetheless, they took part in several missions behind enemy lines, even as far as Losheim [...] behind the front line, to capture enemy soldiers for intelligence. Bouck and several of his men were among the first group in their regiment to be recognized with the Combat Infantry Badge. Most often their patrols {{consisted of}} creeping through snow-clogged defiles obscured by fog in an attempt to fix enemy positions.|$|E

50|$|During parades, unless {{explicitly}} told otherwise, {{soldiers have}} restricted movement, meaning {{they can move}} only exactly when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>told,</b> and then doing only exactly what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> do.

500|$|The {{relentless}} infantry charges posed {{extreme danger}} to the Union artillery batteries in the orchard and on the Wheatfield Road, and {{they were forced to}} withdraw under pressure. The six Napoleons of Capt.

500|$|At this point, {{the morale}} of the Viet Minh {{soldiers}} was greatly lowered due to the massive casualties they had received. During a period of stalemate from 15 April to 1 May, the French intercepted enemy radio messages which told of whole units refusing orders to attack, and communist prisoners said that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> advance or be shot by the officers and noncommissioned officers behind them. Worse still, the Viet Minh lacked advanced medical care, with one stating that [...] "Nothing strikes at combat morale like the knowledge that if wounded, the soldier will go uncared for". To avert the crisis of mutiny, Giáp called in fresh reinforcements from Laos.|$|E
500|$|The textile {{department}} {{was run by}} the constructivist designer Varvara Stepanova. In common with other departments, it was run on utilitarian lines, but Stepanova encouraged her students to {{take an interest in}} fashion: <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>told</b> <b>to</b> carry notebooks so that they could note the contemporary fabrics and aesthetics of everyday life as seen on the high street. Stepanova wrote in her 1925 course plan that this was done [...] "with the goal of devising methods for a conscious awareness of the demands imposed on us by new social conditions". Lyubov Popova was {{also a member of the}} textile faculty, and in 1922, when hired to design fabrics for the First State Textile Print Factory, Popova and Stepanova were among the first women designers in the Soviet textile industry. Popova designed textiles both with asymmetrical architectonic geometries, and also work that was thematic. Before her death in 1924, Popova produced fabrics with grids of printed hammers and sickles, which would predate work by others in the political climate of the first five-year plan.|$|E
