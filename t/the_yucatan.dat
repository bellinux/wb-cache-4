5|$|A {{tropical}} wave in {{the western}} Caribbean organized into Tropical Depression Twenty on October 1. Off the coast of <b>the</b> <b>Yucatán</b> Peninsula, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Stan on October 2. Stan made landfall on <b>the</b> <b>Yucatán</b> and weakened to a tropical depression, but upon reemerging into the Bay of Campeche it quickly strengthened into a hurricane on October 4. Stan made landfall later that morning on the east-central coast of Mexico, south of Veracruz, as a Category1 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 17. It moved across the shear-ridden Atlantic Ocean without development, and remained disorganized until reaching the western Caribbean Sea on September 26. There, the wave situated itself beneath an upper-level anticyclone, allowing for favorable upper-level outflow and for deep convection to develop. On the September 27, a low pressure area developed while the system was located a few hundred miles to the east of <b>the</b> <b>Yucatán</b> Peninsula. The system continued to organize, and nearly developed into a tropical depression before moving ashore on <b>the</b> <b>Yucatán</b> Peninsula on September 29.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Florence {{were from a}} {{tropical}} wave that moved through the Lesser Antilles into the eastern Caribbean on September21. The wave tracked generally westward, and spawned a tropical storm on September23 about 100mi (160km) southeast of Jamaica. Given the name Florence, the storm steadily intensified after developing, although a well-defined circulation was not observed until September24. That day, Florence attained hurricane status in <b>the</b> <b>Yucatán</b> Channel between <b>the</b> <b>Yucatán</b> Peninsula and the western tip of Cuba.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} wave {{continued to}} move rapidly to the west-northwest, until {{it reached the}} western Caribbean Sea. While south of Cuba and through the Cayman Islands, the system slowed down to regenerate convection, and it re-developed into a tropical depression on August 8. Operationally, the system was classified a tropical wave until a day later. The depression moved through <b>the</b> <b>Yucatán</b> Channel, and intensified into Tropical Storm Bonnie on August 9 while 70miles (115km) north of <b>the</b> <b>Yucatán</b> Peninsula.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the surface}} low {{pressure}} center dissipated, {{the remnants of}} Mitch maintained a circulation aloft that reached the Bay of Campeche on November2. That day, the system began to trigger convection once again. Late on November3, the Hurricane Hunters observed a well-defined low-level center and flight-level winds of 60mph (95km/h). On that basis, the NHC began reissuing advisories on Mitch about 55mi (90km) west-southwest of Campeche, Campeche on <b>the</b> <b>Yucatán</b> Peninsula. Upon reforming, Mitch was moving to the east-northeast, influenced by an approaching cold front. Early on November4, Mitch made landfall just north of Campeche with winds of about 40mph (65km/h), and it quickly weakened into a tropical depression while crossing <b>the</b> <b>Yucatán</b> Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|By late on May 29, a weak trough over <b>the</b> <b>Yucatán</b> Peninsula {{produced}} {{a small area}} of convection over <b>the</b> <b>Yucatán</b> Channel. Convection increased {{in association with the}} trough, and the next day a broad envelop of cyclonic turning developed within the system. By May 30, the moisture from the trough extended from Nicaragua through the southeastern Gulf of Mexico, with the greatest area of convection near Cuba. A westward moving tropical wave spawned a broad area of low pressure on May 30, and by May 31 a circulation developed within the system to the southeast of Cozumel, Mexico. The low moved north-northeastward, and gradually became better organized despite high amounts of vertical wind shear. The deep convection became more concentrated near the center, and it is estimated the system developed into a tropical depression at 1200UTC on June 1 just to the northwest of the western tip of Cuba. Operationally, it was not classified until eleven hours later.|$|E

These deep caves of <b>the</b> central <b>Yucatán</b> remain largely unexplored due to the number of cenotes in <b>the</b> State of <b>Yucatán,</b> and <b>the</b> depths, which require technical diving techniques or rebreathers.

5|$|Mayapan was {{abandoned}} around 1448, {{after a period}} of political, social and environmental turbulence that in many ways echoed the Classic period collapse in the southern Maya region. The abandonment of the city was followed by a period of prolonged warfare, disease and natural disasters in <b>the</b> <b>Yucatán</b> Peninsula, which ended only shortly before Spanish contact in 1511. Even without a dominant regional capital, the early Spanish explorers reported wealthy coastal cities and thriving marketplaces. During the Late Postclassic, <b>the</b> <b>Yucatán</b> Peninsula was divided into a number of independent provinces that shared a common culture but varied in internal sociopolitical organization. On the eve of the Spanish conquest, the highlands of Guatemala were dominated by several powerful Maya states. The K'iche' had carved out a small empire covering {{a large part of the}} western Guatemalan Highlands and the neighbouring Pacific coastal plain. However, in the decades before the Spanish invasion the Kaqchikel kingdom had been steadily eroding the kingdom of the K'iche'.|$|E

At 1200UTC on September7, the storm intensified into a Category2 hurricane while located east-northeast of Cozumel, Quintana Roo, Mexico (actual use of the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which was developed in 1971, was not in effect). Shortly thereafter, Carla crossed <b>the</b> <b>Yucatán</b> Channel and entered the Gulf of Mexico. A strong high pressure area forced Carla to resume its original northwesterly course. Early on September8, the storm strengthened into a Category3 hurricane while located just north of <b>the</b> <b>Yucatán</b> Peninsula. Thus, Carla was the third major hurricane of the season. Carla was upgraded to a Category4 hurricane early on September10, while approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States. At 0000UTC on September11, Carla strengthened into a Category5 while located in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.
