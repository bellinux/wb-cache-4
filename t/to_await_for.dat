However, his northwestern forces spectacularly lost the Battle of Luang Namtha, and he was forced to join a coalition government. In July 1962, the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos was signed, pledging that all foreign troops would exit Laos. The North Vietnamese government would not honor the treaty, however; they withdrew only a token contingent, leaving most of their invading troops inside Laos. In its aftermath, Phoumi would make another attempt at asserting RLG control in a communist-controlled area of Laos, at Lak Sao.|$|E

The knowledge that he alone was possessed of the means of distinguishing La Marck in the contest--the recollection by whom that information had been communicated, and the fair augury which might be drawn from her conveying it to him--the thought that his fortune had brought him to a most perilous and doubtful crisis indeed, but one where there was still, at least, a chance of his coming off triumphant--banished every desire to sleep and strung his nerves with vigour which defied fatigue.|$|E

50|$|With the monsoon, Portuguese India armadas usually {{arrived in}} India in early September (sometimes late August). Because {{of the wind}} pattern, they usually made {{landfall}} around Anjediva island (Angediva). From there, the armada furled their square sails and proceed with lateen sails south along the Malabar coast of India {{to the city of}} Cochin (Cochim, Kochi) in Kerala. Cochin was the principal spice port accessible to the Portuguese, it had the earliest Portuguese factory and fort in India, and served as the headquarters of Portuguese government and operations in India for the first decades. However, this changed after the Portuguese conquest of Goa in 1510. The capture of Goa had been largely motivated by the desire to find a replacement for Anjediva as the first anchoring point for the armadas. Anjediva had proven itself to be far from ideal. The island was generally undersupplied - it contained only a few fishing villages - but the armada ships were often forced to sojourn there for long periods, usually for repair or <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>for</b> better winds to carry them down to Cochin. Anjediva island also lay in precarious pirate-infested waters, on the warring frontier between Muslim Bijapur and Hindu Vijaynagar, which frequently threatened it. The same winds which carried the armada down to Cochin prevented Portuguese squads from Cochin racing up to rescue it. The Portuguese had tried setting up a fort in Anjediva, but it was captured and dismantled by forces on behalf of Bijapur. As a result, the Portuguese governor Afonso de Albuquerque decided the nearby island-city of Goa was preferable and forcibly seized it in 1510. Thereafter Goa, with its better harbor and greater supply base, served as the first anchorage point of Portuguese armadas upon arriving in India. Although Cochin, with its important spice markets, remained the ultimate destination, and was still the official Portuguese headquarters in India until the 1530s, Goa was more favorably located relative to Indian Ocean wind patterns and served as its military-naval center. The docks of Goa were soon producing their own carracks for the India run back to Portugal and for runs to further points east.|$|E
5000|$|Nzire Ani or Nzide Ani {{festival is}} a festival celebrated by Anam people. The Name Nzire Ani means the coming down of Ani Anam deity from {{on top of}} Nkpu (Anthill) were it is kept during the {{flooding}} season. It {{marks the beginning of}} a new native year. It can be regarded as a pagan festival because it has the foundation from Ani Anam deity. Before we can understand the festival let's first of all treat Ani Anam deity.Ani Anam is best regarded as a covenant rather than an Oracle. During the early settlement of Anam people there was a lot of crime such as adultery, killing of a fellow Anamite, stealing, covetousness, betrayal etc. This resulted from the heterogeneity of Anam communities so the elders decided to have a bond that will bind all together and promote security and mutual trust. On that fateful day the elders gathered at Odah and made a covenant, that no Anamite shall kill a fellow Anamite, No Anamite shall covet another's property or wife, No Anamite shall betray his brother, No Anamite shall bear false witness against the other. This is why the invocation of the deity starts with Ani Anam akodi onye eme ive ma ive emie what it means is that the convenient goes after the guilty and not the just. The covenant is synonymous to the ten commandment.Anam being a flood prone area is usually being submerged in water during the rainy season, this flood destroys their houses, crops, livestock and something kills their children. During this season children and valuable artifacts are kept on the nkpu and okpulukpu (platforms) built in the house above water level. The people during this period prays to their ancestors for protection and safe keeping. The Ani Anam deity is also kept on this platform as well. When the flood receded, the chief priest announces a date for the Ani deity to return to its abode and it is marked with pomp and pageantry, the people gives offering of Thanksgiving to their chi for protecting them from destruction.Another aspect of the festival is the marking of the victory over the Adah and Aboh warriors. Anam people during the 18th century were usually invaded by the Adah warriors who usually come to the area for slave poaching, one day our people summoned the courage to fight back and on this fateful day the assembled all able bodied men, youths and children at Odah <b>to</b> <b>await</b> <b>for</b> the boat of this slave hunters, when they came the Anamites started pelting them with stones such that their boats capsized and they drowned in water, this marked the end of their exploits in the area. This victory over Adah warriors boosted the morale of ndi Anam that it is usually celebrated every year so that the story shall be told to generations unborn. This victory is also marked during the Nzire Ani festival.The third aspect of this festival is the dedication of the new year and the new planting season to God and the ancestors. This festival is used by the elders to appease the gods for a bountiful harvest in the new planting season. It is after this festival that farmers go back to their farms to cultivate. This festival was usually being celebrated in October but it was moved to the last eke day before the Christmas Day to accommodate people who may be coming home during the Christmas holiday and to ensure wider participation.The festival also reminds ndi Anam of their victory against the Aboh people. Ndi Aboh became a thorn in the flesh of Ndi Anam using ugbondu (canon shots) given to them by the Portuguese collaborators. The casualties became much that ndi Anam decided to consult a diviner to know what could be done to stop the invaders. The diviners told them that a charm shall be prepared, the charm shall be taken into the boat of the Aboh warriors but the person that will carry the charm must be killed by the warriors but the charm will cause confusion such that Anam warriors will slaughter all the Aboh invaders. The charm was prepared and the problem became who shall carry the charm no one accepted until one young man called Iwoegbune from Umuodionwu in Umuebendu quarters of Umueze Anam volunteered to carry the charm, this heroic volunteering thrown the town into joy such that his cousin Amah from Umuamekeme in Umuebendu quarters volunteered to ensure that his brother head returns home once killed while Obalichi from Umuoba led the warriors to fight the Aboh warriors led by the Aboh Prince. The plan was carried out perfectly such that the charm was taken by Iwo to the Aboh camp, he was killed as foretold his brother Amah fought and brought back the head of the hero while the warriors led by the great fighter Obalichi slaughtered all the Aboh warriors including the prince and freed Anam people in their slave camp some returned to Anam while others who could not return settled at Umunankwo in present-day Ogbaru. Prof Alex Asigbo you may correct if am wrong. This festival tells this story too.The celebration of this festival starts a month to the actual date of the celebration with the Otiekwe Adah, this a masquerade that moves round the village with a wooden gong to announce to the people that the festival is at hand. This is symbolic because it signifies the way the warriors that defeated Adah people were mobilized. The Otiekwe Adah moves round the villages every night with the chant [...] "egwue egwue Otiekwe busa nkonko" [...] It is usually called mmanwu anwulu.The eve of the Nzire Ani is usually eventful, it is the last day of Otiekwe masquerade performance and the dreadful Akpali masquerade. Akpali masquerade is the spirit that controls the water current (turbulence) when this masquerade performs at night and in the morning boats are docked ashore even at the village square, earthen pots kept carelessly are broken by this wave. The Akpali masquerades abhors light and breaks every light placed on their path. It is only the initiates that comes out at night to be a part of the masquerade procession while Izummuo (Otummuo) age grades regulates their activities [...]The Nzire Ani day is a very eventful day it starts at dawn with the procession of Adah masquerade. The Adah masquerade is led by odogwu Ada that goes with Oji and is led by Okpokolo age grade. The procession terminates at Odah bank of the Onwambala river where the masquerade pelts stones into the river to signify the defeat of the Adah people. After this is done, the next is the mobilization of the youths for ijo Nzire Ani, this Ijo is used to mock those who may have engaged in any immoral and evil acts. This is done to discourage people from carrying out evil plots.After the Ijo Nzire Ani, the elders converge at the eldest man's house to join him as he pours libations to the ancestors and prays for Gods's blessings, favour and protection on our people and for fruitful planting season. Otimkpala masquerade appears at this point with a whip and symbolically whips the eldest man on his leg this gives the otimkpala masquerades the powers to whip everybody that comes their way. The Otimkpala masquerades performs side by side with the libations and offer of Thanksgiving to their gods by the elders. At about 4pm the strong and brave youths appears at the village square with canes to wrestle With the spirits (okpa ege). The masquerades with their cane whips the men while the men dodges with their own stick and when a masquerade is thrown it goes out of the scene, same with the men the last man standing wins the contest in Umueze Anam this part is the one we enjoy the most and the likes of Jaja Chukwuemeka Nwanegbo, Isaac Emeka, Chuks Agu, Francis Ndife comes to mind.While the wrestling is going on, the Owakwa masquerade gets ready to perform. The Owakwa masquerade comes out with bravery and supernatural powers. The masquerade goes about with a live fowl tied on the head at the back, the opotiyi masquerade is expected to appear and cut off this fowl but the Owakwa will not allow it so both of them engages in hide and seek game while the opotiyi marshals out its plan to take the fowl, the Owakwa will be pursuing him with a big stick if the opotiyi fails to cut off the fowl, the Owakwa goes with it, but if he succeeds the opotiyi goes with it. At the sunset when the Owakwa finishes his performance, the about of eneooo takes over the airwaves and at this point the women and children goes to bed because the greatest of the masquerade (Odumodu) is getting ready to come out. At this point it is the time for ochiagba Odumodu and I enjoy this part a lot it is only the initiates comes out at this point. The Odumodu has so many powers and manipulations, one of this is that it duplicates itself such that one can be at one end of the town and the other at the other end. It has ibobo such that you cannot run faster than the masquerade. This masquerade remains powerless until it pays homage to the Ani Anam deity and the eldest man it is when it goes to the bearer of Ani Anam that he takes the cane and his powers restored to him. This masquerade performs all night long and in at dawn it goes home walking like a boneless wanderer hence the saying that [...] " [...] kero nke inaga ka Odumodu chi voru".|$|E
