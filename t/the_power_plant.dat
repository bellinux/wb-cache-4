40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> nuclear <b>power</b> is <b>the</b> {{clear energy}} and <b>the</b> nuclear <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> is <b>the</b> good <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> project, but someone {{disagree}} {{the project for}} the environment impact from the nuclear radioactivity. This paper compares the different opinions about <b>the</b> nuclear <b>power</b> project and analyzes the existing problems. The advantages of <b>the</b> nuclear <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> are <b>the</b> abundant raw material uranium, the light environment pollution, the low operation cost and the environment radioactivity risk. The disadvantages of the project are the public fear from the nuclear risk, the difficult to dispose the nuclear waste, and the difficult to dismantle <b>the</b> nuclear <b>power</b> <b>plant.</b> My opinion is to develop <b>the</b> nuclear <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> in places with poor energy resource, and develop <b>the</b> hydroelectric <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> in places with rich water resource, and develop <b>the</b> wind <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> in places with rich wind resource, and develop <b>the</b> heat <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> in places with rich coal, oil, natural gas or other fossil fuel resources...|$|R
3000|$|From Figs.  5 and 6, it {{is implied}} {{that under the}} {{government}} tariffs, [...] X_ 1 ^* = (1, 0) [...] is the ESS point {{of the game and}} all <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> will be driven to adopt the green energy source in the long-term evolution. From the numerical example, it is found that the tariffs imposed by the government have important short-term and long-term effects on the source selection decisions of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> Sensitivity analysis on the tariffs can determine the short-term strategies of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> Furthermore, they can show how the strategies of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> evolve in long term. Therefore, the results of the sensitivity analyses can reveal appropriate decisions of the government with respect to the budget limitations and environmental standard considerations.|$|R

The theoretical part contains basic concepts related to topics such as unemployment, migration or energy. The practical part analyzes data from the Czech Statistical Office related to commuting and interviews with the representatives of each of <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants.</b> Based on this analysis, {{it can be said that}} the closure would affect most of the regions in which <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> are located.

Mulder continues to work on restoring the X-Files, and is told by Scully that Fowley's report does not reflect what really happened. Scully tells Mulder that the alien virus DNA is also part of all human DNA, but in Gibson the DNA is active.

Water is either pumped from the lower to the upper reservoir to serve as stored energy or released from the upper to the lower reservoir to generate electricity. Pumping occurs during low demand, cheap electricity, periods such as night and generating will occur during peak demand, expensive electricity, hours such as during the day. The pumping/generating process repeats as needed.|$|E
