After receiving some not-so-helpful {{advice from}} her coworkers—especially Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) and Darryl, {{who is now}} assistant regional manager—Clark invites Erin to his apartment for <b>the</b> <b>fake</b> audition. However, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy), who has come to dislike Clark, invites himself and Andy along under the pretense of helping with the audition, ruining Clark's seduction plan.

5|$|There is no {{encryption}} algorithm {{present in the}} Agrippa binary; consequently, the visual encryption effect that displays when the poem has finished is a ruse.

Only <b>the</b> <b>fake</b> genetic code is written back to disk.|$|E
5|$|Days later, Lebowski {{contacts}} the Dude {{stating that}} Bunny has been kidnapped. Lebowski wants the Dude {{to deliver a}} briefcase containing a million-dollar ransom {{and see if he}} can recognize the culprits. Later, a different pair of thugs appear in the Dude's apartment, knock him unconscious, and take Lebowski's rug. When Bunny's kidnappers call to arrange delivery of the ransom, Walter instead gives the kidnappers a fake ransom, namely, a briefcase filled with dirty underwear. The kidnappers grab <b>the</b> <b>fake</b> ransom and leave. Later that night, the Dude's car is stolen, with the real ransom money briefcase still inside.|$|E
5|$|Literary critic Tom McCarthy {{thought that}} The Black Island linked to Hergé's other Adventures in various ways; he {{connected}} the counterfeit {{money in the}} story to the counterfeit idol in The Broken Ear and <b>the</b> <b>fake</b> bunker in Tintin in the Land of the Soviets. He also connected Tintin's solving of the puzzle in the airman's jacket to his solving of the pirate puzzles in The Secret of the Unicorn, and that in transmitting from a place of death, Ben Mor, or mort (death), it linked to Tintin's transmitting from the crypt of Marlinspike Hall in The Secret of the Unicorn.|$|E

5|$|One notable Dream Shake {{happened}} in Game 2 of the 1995 Western Conference Finals against the Spurs. With David Robinson guarding him, Olajuwon performed a cross-over, {{drove to the}} basket and faked a layup. Robinson, an excellent defender, kept up with Olajuwon and remained planted. Olajuwon spun counterclockwise and faked a jump shot. Robinson, who was voted the 1995 NBA MVP, fell for <b>the</b> <b>fake</b> and jumped to block the shot. With Robinson in the air, Olajuwon performed an up-and-under move and made an easy layup.|$|E
5|$|Planet Terror makes {{heavy use}} of digital effects {{throughout}} the film. Perhaps {{the most notable}} effect is Cherry's (Rose McGowan) fake leg. To accomplish <b>the</b> <b>fake</b> leg that Cherry sports after her accident, during post-production the effects teams digitally removed McGowan's right leg from the shots {{and replaced it with}} computer-generated props—first a table leg and then an M16 rifle. During shooting for these scenes, McGowan wore a special cast which restricted her leg movement to give her the correct motion, and helped the effects artists to digitally remove it during post-production.|$|E
5|$|She {{wanted the}} {{production}} and costume design to reflect the themes of the story. There is a progression from the organic world of Megan's hometown, where the dominant colors are orange and brown, to <b>the</b> <b>fake</b> world of True Directions, dominated by intense blues and pinks (which are intended to show the artificiality of gender construction). According to Babbit, the germaphobic character of Mary Brown represents AIDS paranoia and her clean, ordered world is filled with plastic flowers, fake sky and PVC outfits. The external shots of the colorful house complete with a bright pink picket fence were filmed in Palmdale, California.|$|E

30|$|It {{has already}} been shown that under guidance, {{individuals}} can fake personality tests (Viswesvaran and Ones 1999). Faking consists of the deliberate false presentation of one’s self that may be favourable (fake good) or unfavourable (fake bad) (Hayes et al. 2012). Various theories exist to explain <b>the</b> <b>faking</b> behaviour that can occur due to personal characteristics of an individual or {{as a result of}} contextual variables (McFarland and Ryan 2000; Snell et al. 1999; Tett and Simonet 2011). The majority of <b>the</b> <b>faking</b> research is cross-sectional, and participants receive instructions either to answer honestly (“honest conditions”) or to make a good impression or to make a specific impression of themselves (“faking conditions”) (Shoss and Strube 2011; Tett et al. 2012; Topping and O’Gorman 1997). In the endeavour to identify and avoid <b>the</b> <b>faking</b> behaviour when answering to personality tests, some strategies were devised {{such as the use of}} social desirability scales or the use of response times (Donovan et al. 2003; Holden and Lambert 2015). However, how faking may affect personality assessment usefulness in the medical selection field has been poorly addressed. With this study, we aimed to assess <b>the</b> <b>faking</b> effect on self-report personality tests in a real-life medical school selection process.|$|R

5|$|Though set in {{the modern}} day, the film uses various {{unconventional}} techniques to make the films look like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s. Throughout both feature-length segments and <b>the</b> <b>fake</b> trailers, the film is intentionally damaged {{to make it look}} like many of the exploitation films of the 1970s, which were generally shipped around from theater to theater and usually ended up in bad shape. To reproduce the look of damaged film reels in Planet Terror, five of the six 25,000-frame reels were edited with real film damage, plug-ins, and stock footage.|$|E

All three men take turns free-associating among themselves, and all three keep making statements which might be subtle clues or taunts, but could equally well be innocent. Growing ever more desperate as his time runs out, Max starts describing his planned evening with Flora in graphic detail. The two honest men are too inebriated to be affected, but <b>the</b> <b>faker</b> starts sweating and his breath becomes heavier, and that gives him away.|$|R

5|$|While {{trying to}} escape from East to West Berlin, British agent 009 is fatally wounded and dies after {{reaching}} the residence of the British Ambassador, dressed as a circus clown and carrying a fake Fabergé egg. MI6 immediately suspects Soviet involvement and, after seeing the real egg appear at an auction in London, sends James Bond to investigate and find out {{the identity of the}} seller. At the auction, Bond is able to swap the real egg with <b>the</b> <b>fake</b> and engages in a bidding war with exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan, forcing Khan to pay £500,000 for <b>the</b> <b>fake</b> egg. Bond follows Khan back to his palace in Rajasthan, India, where Bond defeats Khan in a game of backgammon. Bond escapes with his contact Vijay, foiling the attempts of Khan's bodyguard Gobinda to kill the pair. Bond is seduced by one of Khan's associates, Magda, and notices that she has a blue-ringed octopus tattoo. Bond permits Magda to steal the real Fabergé egg fitted with listening and tracking devices by Q, while Gobinda captures and takes Bond to Khan's palace. After Bond escapes from his room he listens in on the bug in the Fabergé egg and discovers that Khan is working with Orlov, a Soviet general, who is seeking to expand Soviet control into West-Central Europe.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to deceiving the French, the Rwandan government used <b>the</b> <b>fake</b> attack on Kigali on 4 October as the pretext for launching {{a wave of}} anti-Tutsi propaganda. They encouraged Hutu citizens to arrest Tutsi suspected of supporting the RPF. With French assistance, and benefiting {{from the loss of}} RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the FAR enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF, and pushed the rebels {{all the way back to}} the Ugandan border. Many soldiers deserted; some crossed back into Uganda, while others went into hiding in the Akagera National Park. The Rwandan government announced on 30 October that the war was over.|$|E
