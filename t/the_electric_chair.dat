However, the rocket is blown off-course and crashes through Mr. Burns' office window. Mr. Burns reads the note and disables the penitentiary's power. In the aftermath, the Simpsons congratulate Ralph, for pointing out that Lisa could solve the problem.|$|E

5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was proposed}} and adopted {{on the grounds}} it was more humane than the methods of execution {{in place at the}} time, such as <b>the</b> <b>electric</b> <b>chair</b> and gas chamber. Opponents of lethal injection reject this argument, noting multiple cases where executions have been either painful, prolonged, or both. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, lethal injections have the highest rate of botched executions of any method used in the US, with 7.12% of executions using this method between 1982 and 2010 considered to have not gone according to plan. A study published in The Lancet in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of hypnotics was insufficient to guarantee unconsciousness. However, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled 7–2 in 2008 (Baze v. Rees) and 5–4 in 2015 (Glossip v. Gross) that lethal injection does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E
5|$|The dream girl {{is found}} in the form of Nancy, who {{responds}} minimally to Vic but is enamored of Renaldo. Victor and several residents of the building, including Mrs. Trend, run afoul of the killers, and a seemingly random series of slapstick murders occur, for all of which Victor is ultimately blamed. Nancy inevitably becomes target and Vic saves her and kills the exterminators after a long comical fight sequence. The flashback ends and Victor is in <b>the</b> <b>electric</b> <b>chair,</b> and awaits his execution while an elaborate race sequence occurs in which Nancy, accompanied by several nuns, drive manically, Nancy at the wheel, to the scene in order to prove his innocence. Before the switch is pulled however, Nancy arrives just in time and clears his name. The movie concludes with their marriage.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{he needs}} allies, Batman works with Gordon {{and the police}} to retake the prison. Sitting at <b>the</b> <b>electric</b> <b>chair,</b> the Joker offers Batman a choice: kill Bane, or allow Bane's {{heartbeat}} to charge the chair and kill the Joker. Batman uses the electric gloves to stop Bane's heart. Satisfied, the Joker leaves, intending to detonate bombs placed around the city. Batman revives Bane, who injects himself with a steroid that transforms him into a hulking beast. He loses the ensuing battle to Batman and suffers amnesia as a side effect from the steroid, thus preserving Batman's secret identity. With Gordon's help, Batman locates the Joker in the prison chapel. Dismayed that Bane is still alive, the Joker tries to goad Batman into killing him but Batman subdues him instead. Gordon chooses not to pursue Batman, believing he can help the city. In a radio interview during the credits, Quincy Sharp says he will lobby to reopen Arkham Asylum to house the city's worst criminals; after the credits, an imprisoned Deathstroke is approached by Amanda Waller to join her Suicide Squad.|$|E

25|$|The United Kingdom {{considered}} replacing {{hanging with}} <b>the</b> <b>electric</b> <b>chair</b> (as well as considering {{the gas chamber}} and lethal injection) during the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, the findings of which were published in 1953.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>electric</b> <b>chair</b> {{was adopted}} by Ohio (1897), Massachusetts (1900), New Jersey (1906) and Virginia (1908), and soon became the {{prevalent}} method of execution in the United States, replacing hanging. Most of the states that currently use or have used <b>the</b> <b>electric</b> <b>chair</b> lie east of the Mississippi River. <b>The</b> <b>electric</b> <b>chair</b> remained the most prominent execution method until the mid-1980s when lethal injection became widely accepted for conducting judicial executions.|$|E

Dust, a Czechoslovakian, was deported during the band's return to the United Kingdom following a tour, when the authorities discovered that his visa had expired over a year ago. He was replaced by J.

[...] The Police were actually their support act in 1977. [...] The band's first album with Padovani, Storm the Gates of Heaven, was also his debut as a songwriter. Besides a pair of group compositions, he wrote the music for the song [...] "Cry of Angels". After one more album, Things Your Mother Never Told You, Wayne County & <b>the</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>Chairs</b> split in two. Padovani remained with bassist Val Haller and drummer J.J.
