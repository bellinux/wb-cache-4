5|$|Models of how Siletzia formed are of {{two general}} types: (1) Formation well {{offshore}} (possibly as seamounts, like the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, or a hotspot at a spreading ridge, like Iceland) and then accretion to the continent; (2) formation inshore, {{on or near}} <b>the</b> <b>continental</b> margin (perhaps {{as a result of}} transcurrent extension, or of a slab window). All current models then have Siletzia rifting away from <b>the</b> <b>continental</b> edge about a northern pivot.|$|E

2500|$|Heath's Regiment was redesignated on July 1, 1775, as Greaton's Regiment, {{which became}} <b>the</b> 24th <b>Continental</b> Regiment on January 1, 1776. [...] <b>The</b> 24th <b>Continental</b> Regiment was {{consolidated}} on January 1, 1777, with <b>the</b> 25th <b>Continental</b> Regiment (authorized April 23, 1775), with the resulting unit being designated as <b>the</b> 25th <b>Continental</b> Regiment. [...] <b>The</b> 25th <b>Continental</b> Regiment ultimately became the 3rd Massachusetts Regiment on August 1, 1779.

5|$|Several major North American {{drainage}} basins {{and many}} minor ones {{share a common}} border with the Columbia River's drainage basin. To the east, in northern Wyoming and Montana, <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> Divide separates the Columbia watershed from the Mississippi-Missouri watershed, which empties into the Gulf of Mexico. To the northeast, mostly along the southern border between British Columbia and Alberta, <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> Divide separates the Columbia watershed from the Nelson-Lake Winnipeg-Saskatchewan watershed, which empties into Hudson Bay. The Mississippi and Nelson watersheds are separated by the Laurentian Divide, which meets <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> Divide at Triple Divide Peak near {{the headwaters of the}} Columbia's Flathead River tributary. This point marks the meeting of three of North America's main drainage patterns, to the Pacific Ocean, to Hudson Bay, and to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Continental</b> Army had {{previously}} suffered several defeats in New York {{and had been}} forced to retreat through New Jersey to Pennsylvania.

50|$|The four {{artillery}} regiments received {{numbers on}} 10 August 1779.

500|$|The place Campbell {{selected}} for landing was Girardeau's Plantation, located about [...] below the city.

[...] Campbell realized that the bluffs {{would need to be}} controlled before the majority of his forces could land, and dispatched two companies of the 71st Regiment to take control of them. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Continentals</b> opened fire at about the British, rather than returning fire, advanced rapidly with bayonets fixed, denying <b>the</b> <b>Continentals</b> a second shot. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Continentals</b> retreated, having killed four and wounded five at no cost to themselves.

5|$|The siege {{began on}} April 19 after the Battles of Lexington and Concord, when the militia from {{surrounding}} Massachusetts communities blocked land access to Boston. <b>The</b> <b>Continental</b> Congress formed <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> Army from the militia, with George Washington as its Commander in Chief. In June 1775, the British seized Bunker and Breed's Hills, {{from which the}} Continentals were preparing to bombard the city, but their casualties were heavy and their gains were insufficient to break <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> Army's hold on land access to Boston. The Americans laid siege to the British-occupied city. Military actions during {{the remainder of the}} siege were limited to occasional raids, minor skirmishes, and sniper fire.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all of the}} fifty-five delegates {{had taken}} part in the Revolution, with at least twenty-nine having served in <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> forces, most in {{positions}} of command.

The vast majority (about 75%) of the delegates were or had been members of the Confederation Congress, and many had been members of <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> Congress during the Revolution.

5|$|Archeological {{data from}} the Late Pleistocene in South Asia is vital for our {{understanding}} of the evolution of modern human behavior and how early humans spread through the Old World. In prehistoric times, the movement of human and faunal populations from the Indian mainland to Sri Lanka and back took place over <b>the</b> <b>continental</b> shelf shared between the two countries, which from around 7000 BP has been submerged below the Palk Strait and Adam's Bridge. Being only around 70 m deep, significant reductions in sea level due to climate change, in at least the past 500,000 years, periodically caused <b>the</b> <b>continental</b> shelf to be exposed, forming a land bridge approximately 100km wide and 50km long.|$|E
5|$|As {{a ranking}} prisoner-of-war, Colonel Stacy {{was the subject}} of {{high-level}} correspondence and actions of General George Washington and other leaders of <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> Army. During April 1780, General Lafayette, who fought with the Americans during the Revolution, hand-carried a letter from General William Heath to General Washington, describing a reported Loyalist and British strategy concerning Stacy. The strategy was to continue holding Colonel Stacy as a prisoner-of-war, and to use Stacy in a prisoner exchange, should Colonel Butler or another ranking Loyalist officer, Sir John Johnson, be captured by <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> Army. During September 1780, General Washington attempted to arrange a prisoner exchange for Colonel Stacy, but was unsuccessful. On November 1, 1781, the General Assembly of Massachusetts passed a Resolve urging Governor John Hancock to encourage General Heath to pursue a prisoner exchange for Stacy.|$|E

5|$|Because most of {{the newly}} formed {{regiment}} surrendered to British and German forces at the Battle of Fort Washington on November 16, 1776, the service history of the unit's surviving element is complex. Although modern and contemporaneous accounts of the battle convey the impression that it {{marked the end of}} the regiment as a combat entity, {{a significant portion of the}} unit continued to serve actively in <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> Army throughout {{most of the}} remainder of the war. Elements of the regiment served with George Washington's Main Army and participated in the army's major engagements of late 1776 through 1778. Select members of the regiment were also attached to Col. Daniel Morgan's elite Provisional Rifle Corps at its inception in mid-1777. The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was reorganized in January 1779 and was stationed at Fort Pitt, headquarters of <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> Army's Western Department, in present-day western Pennsylvania primarily to help in the defense of frontier settlements from raids by British-allied Indian tribes. The unit was disbanded with all other Additional and Extra Continental regiments during the reorganization of <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> Army in January 1781. It was the longest serving Continental Army rifle unit of the war.|$|E
5|$|Between {{conventions}} in April 1775, Randolph, who {{was both}} the Speaker of the House of Burgesses and President of the Virginia Conventions, negotiated with Lord Dunmore for gunpowder {{removed from the}} Williamsburg arsenal to a British warship during the Gunpowder Incident, which was a confrontation between the Governor's forces and Virginia militia, led by Patrick Henry. The House of Burgesses was called back by Lord Dunmore one last time in June 1775 to address British Prime Minister Lord North's Conciliatory Resolution. Randolph, who was a delegate to <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> Congress, returned to Williamsburg {{to take his place}} as Speaker. Randolph indicated that the resolution had not been sent to the Congress (it had instead been sent to each colony individually in an attempt to divide them and bypass <b>the</b> <b>Continental</b> Congress).
