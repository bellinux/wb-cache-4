5|$|Talented slaves with a {{knack for}} {{business}} might accumulate a large enough peculium <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>their</b> freedom, or be manumitted for services rendered. Manumission had become frequent enough that in 2 BC a law (Lex Fufia Caninia) limited the number of slaves an owner was allowed to free in his will.|$|E
5|$|At the May 2012 Digital Hollywood conference, Lindelof {{said that}} the videos {{originated}} from {{the question of the}} film's status as an Alien prequel. It was decided that creating videos with the film's stars would generate more interest than any commentary about its connection to the Alien films. He also {{said that the}} videos needed to be cool enough <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>their</b> existence, but not so important that their absence from the final film would be an issue for audiences.|$|E
5|$|Officers in {{the field}} {{were well aware of}} the killing {{operations}} being conducted by the Einsatzgruppen. The Wehrmacht tried <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>their</b> considerable involvement in the Einsatzgruppen massacres as being anti-partisan operations rather than racist attacks, but Hillgruber wrote that this was just an excuse. He states that those German generals who claimed that the Einsatzgruppen were a necessary anti-partisan response were lying, and maintained that the slaughter of about 2.2 million defenceless civilians for reasons of racist ideology cannot be justified.|$|E
50|$|Anti-religious {{propaganda}} {{played a}} critical role in the persecutions, because they were used to develop attitudes of hostility against believers which could then lead <b>to</b> <b>justifying</b> <b>their</b> mistreatment.|$|R

5|$|Under the Constitution, the Cabinet is collectively {{responsible}} to Parliament. In theory, Parliament {{acts as a}} check on the power of the Cabinet as Ministers are required <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>their</b> actions and policies upon being questioned by MPs. However, in Singapore this is a weak check because the ruling People's Action Party holds a large Parliamentary majority, and party members who are MPs are required by party discipline to vote according to the party Whip's instructions.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the 2000 United States Census, city {{officials}} made a push to get residents to respond {{and participate in the}} enumeration, citing calculations by city officials that as many as 30,000 people were not reflected in estimates from the Census Bureau, which resulted in the loss of government aid and political representation. It is believed that heavily immigrant areas of Newark were significantly undercounted in the 2010 Census, especially in the East Ward. Many households refused to participate in the census, with immigrants often reluctant to submit census forms because they believed that the information could be used <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>their</b> deportation.|$|E
5|$|In the north, Coba on {{the eastern}} side of the Yucatán Peninsula raised at least 23 large stelae. Although badly eroded their style and texts link them to cities from the Petén Basin. At the {{southern}} periphery of the Maya region, Copán developed a new high-relief style of stelae and in 652 the twelfth king ChanImixK'awiil arranged a series of these stelae to define the sacred geometry of the city, and to celebrate his royal rule and his ancestors. His son and successor UaxaclajuunUb'aahK'awiil further developed this new high-relief style of sculpture and erected a series of intricately decorated stelae in the city's Great Plaza that brought the carving of stelae close to full in-the-round three-dimensional sculpture. Both of these kings focused on their own images on their stelae and emphasised their place in the dynastic sequence <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>their</b> rule, possibly linked to a break in the dynastic sequence with the death of the eleventh king of Copán.|$|E

5|$|The {{image of}} the masque within the play deals with hiding one's identity. Fielding, like many other playwrights, focuses on how the masque genre deals with the social {{acceptability}} of altering identities within the format. However, Fielding extends the image to discuss society and those who impersonate social and gender roles {{that they do not}} fill. Fielding also has a problem with those who act viciously with license even though he is willing to accept some of the lesser libertine actions. Merital, for instance, is a sexual type of libertine and is treated differently than those like Sir Positive Trap, Lord Formal, and Sir Apish Simple who are criticised as being part of the corrupted order. Trap and Formal are part of old families, and their attachment to the age of their families and their attempts to use that <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>their</b> beliefs over what is proper is ridiculed within the play. In particular, Merital is the one able to point out their flaws.|$|E

40|$|William Whewell and J. S. Mill {{disagreed}} {{about the}} role of conceptual innovation in the evolution of science. For Mill, concepts, correctly constructed, are determined by the empirical facts. They are born fully warranted, free from prejudice and bias. For Whewell, concepts are introduced conjecturally, and the process of testing in science is largely devoted <b>to</b> <b>justifying</b> <b>their</b> objective credentials. The key arguments concern the role of concepts in extracting information, and exposing the unifying connections amongst the data. We believe that Whewell provides some important new insights about what counts as empirical evidence, and the relationship between theory and evidence. The resulting theory of scientific inference is importantly different from hypothetico-deductivism, and its recent variants...|$|R

'Degenerates' {{were also}} {{depicted}} in popular fiction of the 19th through to mid 20th century, sometimes in similar ways {{to the modern}} usages {{of the concept of}} psychopaths, sometimes being cited as a cause of psychopathy. The concept fell into disrepute due partly to its use by the Nazis <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> eradicating <b>their</b> opposition.|$|R

Attacks, some led by Semyon Budyonny, {{were able to}} keep the Germans from {{entering}} the Caucausus, where particularly the Terek and the Kuban Cossacks were able to prevent the Germans from taking the mountains. Not only was the region rich in oil, but it was also the key to Iran and Iraq.|$|R
50|$|Midlist {{is a term}} in the {{publishing}} industry which refers to books which are not bestsellers but are strong enough <b>to</b> economically <b>justify</b> <b>their</b> publication (and likely, further purchases of future books from the same author). The vast majority of total titles published are midlist titles, though they represent a much smaller fraction of total book sales, which are dominated by bestsellers and other very popular titles.|$|R

25|$|Mathews {{suggests}} {{the risk of}} nuclear terrorism remains unprevented. In 1999 during the Kosovo War, the U.S. supported the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), a that was recognised as a terrorist organisation by the U.S. some years prior. Right before the 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia took place, the U.S. took down the KLA {{from the list of}} internationally recognized terrorist organizations in order <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> <b>their</b> aid and help to the KLA.|$|E

5000|$|The {{principle}} of maximum disclosure sets a presumption that all information held by public bodies {{should be covered}} by the scope of access to information laws. This presumption accepts only limited circumstances for exceptions. This principle incorporates the very basic rationale underpinning the concept of freedom of information. It entails that public authorities seeking to deny access to public information have the obligation <b>to</b> <b>justifying</b> <b>their</b> refusal. The {{principle of}} maximum disclosure provides for a broad definition of [...] "public bodies" [...] which are subject to the duty of releasing information. Such a broad interpretation includes all branches of government, e.g. local governments, elected bodies, nationalised industries and public corporations, judicial bodies and also private bodies carrying out public functions. Principle 1 requires the law to establish minimum standards regarding the maintenance and preservation of documents by public bodies.|$|R
50|$|Mint mark collections: Many {{collectors}} consider different mint marks significant enough <b>to</b> <b>justify</b> {{representation in}} <b>their</b> collection.
