5|$|Burrowing seabirds such as petrels, prions, and shearwaters {{share the}} tuatara's island habitat during the birds' nesting seasons. The <b>tuatara</b> use the birds' burrows for shelter when available, or dig their own. The seabirds' guano helps to {{maintain}} invertebrate populations on which <b>tuatara</b> predominantly prey; including beetles, crickets, and spiders. Their diets also consist of frogs, lizards, and bird's eggs and chicks. The eggs and young of seabirds that are seasonally available as food for <b>tuatara</b> may provide beneficial fatty acids. <b>Tuatara</b> {{of both sexes}} defend territories, and will threaten and eventually bite intruders. The bite can cause serious injury. <b>Tuatara</b> will bite when approached, and will not let go easily.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tuatara</b> {{feature in}} a number of {{indigenous}} legends, and are held as ariki (God forms). <b>Tuatara</b> are regarded as the messengers of Whiro, the god of death and disaster, and Māori women are forbidden to eat them. <b>Tuatara</b> also indicate tapu (the borders of what is sacred and restricted), beyond which there is mana, meaning there could be serious consequences if that boundary is crossed. Māori women would sometimes tattoo images of lizards, some of which may represent <b>tuatara,</b> near their genitals. Today, <b>tuatara</b> are regarded as a taonga (special treasure).|$|E
5|$|Several <b>tuatara</b> {{breeding}} programmes are active within New Zealand. Southland Museum and Art Gallery in Invercargill {{was the first}} institution to have a <b>tuatara</b> breeding programme; they breed S. punctatus.|$|E

5|$|A {{species of}} sphenodontine is {{known from the}} Miocene Saint Bathans Fauna. Whether it is refereable to Sphenodon proper is not entirely clear, but {{is assumed to be}} closely related to <b>tuataras.</b>|$|R
5|$|Sphenodon punctatus {{naturally}} {{occurs on}} 29 islands, and its population {{is estimated to}} be over 60,000individuals. In 1996, 32 adult northern <b>tuatara</b> were moved from Moutoki Island to Moutohora. The carrying capacity of Moutohora is estimated at 8,500 individuals, and the island could allow public viewing of wild <b>tuatara.</b> In 2003, 60 northern <b>tuatara</b> were introduced to Tiritiri Matangi Island from Middle Island in the Mercury group. They are occasionally seen sunbathing by visitors to the island.|$|E
5|$|The WildNZ Trust has a <b>tuatara</b> {{breeding}} enclosure at Ruawai. One notable captive breeding {{success story}} {{took place in}} January 2009, when all 11 eggs belonging to 110-year-old <b>tuatara</b> Henry and 80-year-old <b>tuatara</b> Mildred hatched. This story is especially remarkable as Henry required surgery to remove a cancerous tumour in order to successfully breed.|$|E
5|$|The recent {{discovery}} of a <b>tuatara</b> hatchling on the mainland indicates that attempts to re-establish a breeding population on the New Zealand mainland have had some success. The total population of <b>tuatara</b> {{is estimated to be}} greater than 60,000, but less than 100,000.|$|E
50|$|Lepidosauromorpha is a {{group of}} {{reptiles}} comprising all diapsids closer to lizards than to archosaurs (which include crocodiles and birds). The only living sub-group is the Lepidosauria: extant lizards, snakes, amphisbaenians and <b>tuataras.</b>|$|R
50|$|Late in the period, the diapsid {{reptiles}} {{split into}} two main lineages, the archosaurs (ancestors of crocodiles and dinosaurs) and the lepidosaurs (predecessors of modern <b>tuataras,</b> lizards, and snakes). Both groups remained lizard-like and relatively small and inconspicuous during the Permian.|$|R
50|$|Male turtles and {{crocodiles}} have a penis, while male {{specimens of}} the reptile order Squamata have two paired organs called hemipenes. <b>Tuataras</b> must use their cloacae for reproduction. Due to evolutionary convergence, turtle and mammal penises {{have a similar}} structure.|$|R
5|$|The spiny {{plates on}} the back and tail of the <b>tuatara</b> {{resemble}} those of a crocodile more than a lizard, but the <b>tuatara</b> shares with lizards the ability to break off its tail when caught by a predator, and then regenerate it.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tuatara</b> spine {{is made up}} of hourglass-shaped amphicoelous vertebrae, concave {{both before}} and behind. This is the usual {{condition}} of fish vertebrae and some amphibians, but is unique to <b>tuatara</b> within the amniotes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tuatara</b> {{have been}} {{referred}} to as living fossils, which means they retain many basal characteristics from {{around the time of the}} squamate – rhynchocephalian split (220 MYA). However, taxonomic work on Sphenodontia has shown this group has undergone a variety of changes throughout the Mesozoic, and a March 2008 molecular study showed their rate of molecular evolution has been the fastest of any animal yet examined. Many of the niches occupied by lizards today were then held by sphenodontians. There was even a successful group of aquatic sphenodontians known as pleurosaurs, which differed markedly from living <b>tuatara.</b> <b>Tuatara</b> show cold weather adaptations that allow them to thrive on the islands of New Zealand; these adaptations may be unique to <b>tuatara</b> since their sphenodontian ancestors lived in the much warmer climates of the Mesozoic. For instance, Palaeopleurosaurus appears to have had a much shorter lifespan compared to the modern <b>tuatara.</b>|$|E
50|$|Over 9,000 {{animals are}} {{presented}} on three storeys. It contains jellyfish, tropical and native fishes, crocodilians (caimans and gharial), {{and a broad}} variety of insects. In addition to its 250 tanks for fish, the aquarium houses {{a wide variety of}} amphibians and reptiles including <b>tuataras.</b>|$|R
5|$|The two living non-archosaurian reptile taxa, {{testudines}} (turtles) and lepidosaurians (lizards and <b>tuataras),</b> {{along with}} choristoderes (semi-aquatic archosauromorphs that would die {{out in the}} early Miocene), survived across the K–Pg boundary. More than 80% of Cretaceous turtle species passed through the K–Pg boundary. Additionally, all six turtle families in existence {{at the end of}} the Cretaceous survived into the Paleogene and are represented by living species. Living lepidosaurs include the <b>tuataras</b> (the only living rhynchocephalians) and the squamates. The rhynchocephalians were a widespread and relatively successful group of lepidosaurians during the early Mesozoic, but began to decline by the mid-Cretaceous, although they were very successful in the Late Cretaceous of South America. They are represented today by a single genus, located exclusively in New Zealand.|$|R
25|$|Early in the period, {{the modern}} reptiles, or crown-group reptiles, evolved and {{split into two}} main lineages: the Archosauromorpha (forebears of turtles, crocodiles, and dinosaurs) and the Lepidosauromorpha (predecessors of modern lizards and <b>tuataras).</b> Both groups {{remained}} lizard-like and relatively small and inconspicuous during the Permian.|$|R
5|$|<b>Tuatara</b> {{were once}} {{widespread}} on New Zealand's main North and South Islands, where subfossil remains {{have been found}} in sand dunes, caves, and Māori middens. Wiped out from the main islands before European settlement, they were long confined to 32offshore islands free of mammals. The islands are difficult to get to, and are colonised by few animal species, indicating that some animals absent from these islands may have caused <b>tuatara</b> to disappear from the mainland. However, kiore (Polynesian rats) had recently become established on several of the islands, and <b>tuatara</b> were persisting, but not breeding, on these islands. Additionally, <b>tuatara</b> were much rarer on the rat-inhabited islands. Prior to conservation work, 25% of the total <b>tuatara</b> population had become extinct in the past century.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tuatara,</b> {{along with}} other, now extinct {{members of the}} order Sphenodontia, belong to the {{superorder}} Lepidosauria, the only surviving taxon within Lepidosauromorpha. Squamates and <b>tuatara</b> both show caudal autotomy (loss of the tail-tip when threatened), and have transverse cloacal slits. The origin of the <b>tuatara</b> probably lies close to the split between the Lepidosauromorpha and the Archosauromorpha. Though <b>tuatara</b> resemble lizards, the similarity is superficial, because the family has several characteristics unique among reptiles. The typical lizard shape is very common for the early amniotes; the oldest known fossil of a reptile, the Hylonomus, resembles a modern lizard.|$|E
5|$|During routine {{maintenance}} work at Karori Sanctuary in late 2008, a <b>tuatara</b> nest was uncovered, with a hatchling found the following autumn. This {{is thought to}} be the first case of <b>tuatara</b> successfully breeding in the wild on the New Zealand mainland in over 200 years.|$|E
50|$|The Saint Bathans {{formation}} also bears {{fossils of}} moa, mekosuchine crocodiles, turtles, skinks, <b>tuataras,</b> geckoes, {{at least eight}} taxa of waterfowl, a petrel, Accipitriformes, rails, a possible seagull, herons, a palaelodid flamingo, pigeons, parrots, a swift, an owlet-nightjar, passerines, the enigmatic Aptornis and a primitive kiwi, Proapteryx.|$|R
50|$|It is {{generally}} uncertain {{what type of}} dinosaurs laid faveoloolithid eggs, though they are conjectured to have been laid by sauropods. Unlike most dinosaur eggs, where the shell membrane and the calcareous eggshell form sequentially, in dictyoolithids and faveoloolithids (including Hemifaveoloolithus) the membrane and shell would develop simultaneously, comparable to eggs of modern <b>tuataras.</b>|$|R
50|$|All {{molecular}} {{studies have}} strongly upheld {{the placement of}} turtles within diapsids; some place turtles within Archosauria, or, more commonly, as a sister group to extant archosaurs. However, {{one of the most}} recent molecular studies, published on 23 February 2012, suggests that turtles are lepidosauromorph diapsids, most closely related to the lepidosaurs (lizards, snakes, and <b>tuataras).</b>|$|R
5|$|In the Hen and Chicken Islands, Pacific rats were {{eradicated}} on Whatupuke in 1993, Lady Alice Island in 1994, and Coppermine Island in 1997. Following this program, juveniles {{have once}} again been {{seen on the}} latter three islands. In contrast, rats persist on Hen Island of the same group, and no juvenile <b>tuatara</b> had been seen there as of 2001. In the Alderman Islands, Middle Chain Island holds no <b>tuatara,</b> but it is considered possible for rats to swim between Middle Chain and other islands that do hold <b>tuatara,</b> and the rats were eradicated in 1992 to prevent this. Another rodent eradication was carried out on the Rangitoto Islands east of D'Urville Island, {{to prepare for the}} release of 432 Cook Strait <b>tuatara</b> juveniles in 2004, which were being raised at Victoria University as of 2001.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tuatara</b> has gastralia, rib-like bones {{also called}} gastric or {{abdominal}} ribs, the presumed ancestral trait of diapsids. They {{are found in}} some lizards, where they are mostly made of cartilage, as well as crocodiles and the <b>tuatara,</b> and are not attached to the spine or thoracic ribs. The true ribs are small projections, with small, hooked bones, called uncinate processes, found on the rear of each rib. This feature is also present in birds. The <b>tuatara</b> is the only living tetrapod with well-developed gastralia and uncinate processes.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tuatara</b> was {{featured}} {{on one side}} of the New Zealand five-cent coin, which was phased out in October 2006. <b>Tuatara</b> was also the name of the Journal of the Biological Society of Victoria University College and subsequently Victoria University of Wellington, published from 1947 until 1993. It has now been digitised by the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre, also at Victoria.|$|E
5000|$|Herpetology (from Greek [...] "herpein" [...] meaning [...] "to creep") is {{the branch}} of zoology {{concerned}} with the study of amphibians (including frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians (gymnophiona)) and reptiles (including snakes, lizards, amphisbaenids, turtles, terrapins, tortoises, crocodilians, and the <b>tuataras).</b> Batrachology is a further subdiscipline of herpetology concerned with the study of amphibians alone.|$|R
25|$|During {{embryonic}} development, the parietal {{eye and the}} pineal {{organ of}} modern lizards and <b>tuataras</b> form together from a pocket formed in the brain ectoderm. The loss of parietal eyes in many living tetrapods is supported by developmental formation of a paired structure that subsequently fuses into a single pineal gland in developing embryos of turtles, snakes, birds, and mammals.|$|R
5|$|The lungs of most {{reptiles}} have {{a single}} bronchus running down the centre, from which numerous branches reach out to individual pockets throughout the lungs. These pockets are similar to alveoli in mammals, but much larger and fewer in number. These give the lung a sponge-like texture. In <b>tuataras,</b> snakes, and some lizards, the lungs are simpler in structure, {{similar to that of}} typical amphibians.|$|R
5|$|In January 2016 Chester Zoo, UK, {{announced}} that they succeeded in breeding the <b>tuatara</b> in captivity first time outside its homeland.|$|E
5|$|The Victoria University of Wellington {{maintains}} a research programme into the captive breeding of <b>tuatara,</b> and the Pukaha Mount Bruce Wildlife Centre keeps a pair and a juvenile.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tuatara</b> Sphenodon punctatus {{has been}} {{protected}} by law since 1895. A second species, S. guntheri, was recognised in 1989 but since 2009 {{it has been}} reclassified as a subspecies. <b>Tuatara,</b> like many of New Zealand's native animals, are threatened by habitat loss and introduced predators, such as the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans). They were extinct on the mainland, with the remaining populations confined to 32offshore islands, until the first mainland release into the heavily fenced and monitored Karori Sanctuary in 2005.|$|E
50|$|The {{scales of}} all {{reptiles}} have an epidermal component (what one sees on the surface), but many reptiles, such as crocodilians and turtles, have osteoderms underlying the epidermal scale. Such scales are more properly termed scutes. Snakes, <b>tuataras</b> and many lizards lack osteoderms. All reptilian scales have a dermal papilla underlying the epidermal part, {{and it is}} there that the osteoderms, if present, would be formed.|$|R
50|$|Within the {{subclass}} Lepidosauria {{there are}} herbivores, omnivores, insectivores, and carnivores. The herbivores consist of iguanines, some agamids, and some skinks. Most lizard species and some snake species are insectivores. The remaining snake species, <b>tuataras,</b> and amphisbaenians, are carnivores. While some snake species are generalist, others eat {{a narrow range}} of prey - for example, Salvadora only eat lizards. The remaining lizards are omnivores and can consume plants or insects.|$|R
50|$|Major {{threats to}} weta include short tailed bats, birds, and {{reptiles}} such as lizards and <b>tuataras.</b> Birds {{that tend to}} eat this weta include the kiwi, robin, tomtit and ruru. Other introduced threats include cats, hedgehogs, rats and mustelids. Another major threat is humans as they tend to destroy the habitat of the weta. These weta tend to avoid locations where spiders are present. The Canterbury tree weta also {{have a tendency to}} avoid slugs.|$|R
