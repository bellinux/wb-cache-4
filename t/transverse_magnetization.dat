25|$|Three {{studies in}} 1992 {{were the first}} to explore using the BOLD {{contrast}} in humans. Kenneth Kwong and colleagues, used a gradient-echo Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) sequence at a magnetic field strength of 1.5 T to study activation in the visual cortex. Ogawa and others conducted the study using a higher field (4.0 T) and showed that the BOLD signal depended on T2* loss of magnetization. T2* decay is caused by magnetized nuclei in a volume of space losing magnetic coherence (<b>transverse</b> <b>magnetization)</b> from both bumping into one another and from intentional differences in applied magnetic field strength across locations (field inhomogeneity from a spatial gradient). Bandettini and colleagues used EPI at 1.5 T to show activation in the primary motor cortex, a brain area at the last stage of the circuitry controlling voluntary movements. The magnetic fields, pulse sequences and procedures and techniques used by these early studies are still used in current-day fMRI studies. But today researchers typically collect data from more slices (using stronger magnetic gradients), and preprocess and analyze data using statistical techniques.|$|E

40|$|Purpose To {{develop a}} method for spoiling <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetizations</b> without {{additional}} gradients to minimize repetition times for radial fast low angle shot (FLASH) MRI. Methods Residual steady state <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetizations</b> and corresponding image artifacts were analyzed for radial gradient echo sequences with constant and randomized RF phases in comparison with a sequence with refocused frequency-encoding gradients, constant spoiler gradient, and conventional RF spoiling (gold standard). The spoiling performance was assessed for different radial trajectories using numerical simulations, phantom experiments, and in vivo MRI studies of the human brain. Results Simulations as well as phantom and in vivo measurements reveal a highly efficient spoiling capacity for randomized RF phases and radial FLASH sequences {{without the need for}} gradient rewinding and spoiler gradients. The data also demonstrate a strong dependence of the spoiling performance on the chosen radial trajectory (ie, the azimuthal angular increment between successive projections) with excellent results for an interleaved multiturn scheme. Conclusion Effective spoiling of <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetizations</b> in radial FLASH MRI may be achieved by randomized RF phases without additional spoiler gradients. The technique allows for short repetition times as required for high-speed real-time MRI...|$|R

50|$|All the {{information}} about the frequency spectrum is encoded in the motion of the <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetization.</b> The frequency spectrum is reconstructed using the time behavior of the <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetization</b> made up of y- and x-axis components. It is convenient that these two can be treated as the real and imaginary components of a complex quantity and use the Fourier theory to transform the measured time domain signal into the frequency domain representation. This is possible because both the absorption (real) and the dispersion (imaginary) signals are detected.|$|E
50|$|This is the {{conclusion}} of the previous section: in a constant magnetic field B0 along z axis the <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetization</b> Mxy rotates around this axis in clockwise direction with angular frequency ω0. If the observer were rotating around the same axis in clockwise direction with angular frequency Ω, Mxy it would appear to him rotating with angular frequency ω0 - Ω. Specifically, if the observer were rotating around the same axis inclockwise direction with angular frequency ω0, the <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetization</b> Mxy would appear to him stationary.|$|E

50|$|Gradient {{enhanced}} NMR is {{a method}} for obtaining high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectra {{without the need for}} phase cycling. Gradient methodology is used extensively for two purposes, either rephasing (selection) or dephasing (elimination) of a particular magnetization transfer pathway. It includes the application of magnetic field gradient pulses to select specific coherences. By using actively shielded gradients, a gradient pulse is applied during the evolution period of the selected coherence to dephase the <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetization</b> and another gradient pulse refocuses the desired coherences remaining during the acquisition period.|$|E

We have found that this parameter has a strong {{effect on the}} magnetic properties in both cases. In the ferromagnetic case, the total longitudinal magnetization curves display Q-and S-type behaviors and the hysteresis loop has just one loop, whereas in the antiferromagnetic case, the N-type behavior, in which one compensation temperature appears below the critical temperature, exists in the total longitudinal magnetization curve versus reduced temperature, and triple hysteresis loops are found. The effect of applied field is also investigated on the total longitudinal magnetization for the both cases, and {{we have found that}} a large applied field value can overcome the antiferromagnetic coupling leading to a ferromagnetic-like behavior...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{minimize}} {{artifacts in}} echo-planar imaging (EPI) of human brain function introduced by simultaneous {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} (TMS). Materials and Methods: Distortions due to TMS pulses (0. 25 msec, 2. 0 T) were studied at 2. 0 T before and during EPI. Results: Best results were obtained if both the EPI section orientation and the frequency-encoding gradient were parallel to {{the plane of the}} TMS coil. Under these conditions, a TMS pulse caused image distortions when preceding the EPI sequence by less than 100 msec. Recordings with a magnetic field gradient pick-up coil revealed transient magnetic fields after TMS, which are generated by eddy currents in the TMS coil. TMS during image acquisition completely spoiled all <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetizations</b> and induced disturbances ranging from image corruption to mild image blurring, depending on the affected low and high spatial frequencies. Simultaneous TMS and radio-frequency (RF) excitation gave rise to T 1 - dependent signal changes that lasted for several seconds and yielded pronounced false-positive activations during functional brain mapping. Conclusion: To ensure reliable and robust combinations, TMS should be applied at least 100 msec before EPI while completely avoiding any pulses during imaging...|$|R

50|$|An MR {{image is}} a {{complex-valued}} map of the spatial distribution of the <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetization</b> Mxy in the sample at a specific time point after an excitation. Conventional qualitative interpretation of Fourier Analysis asserts that low spatial frequencies (near the center of k-space) contain the signal to noise and contrast information of the image, whereas high spatial frequencies (outer peripheral regions of k-space) contain the information determining the image resolution. This {{is the basis for}} advanced scanning techniques, such as the keyhole acquisition, in which a first complete k-space is acquired, and subsequent scans are performed for acquiring just {{the central part of the}} k-space; in this way, different contrast images can be acquired without the need of running full scans.|$|E
50|$|The spin-spin {{relaxation}} time, {{also called the}} transverse relaxation time, is related to homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening. An inhomogeneous broadening results {{from the fact that}} the different spins experience local magnetic field inhomogeneities (different surroundings) creating a large number of spin packets characterized by a distribution of Δω. As the net magnetization vector precesses, some spin packets slow down due to lower fields and others speed up due to higher fields leading to a fanning out of the magnetization vector that results in the decay of the EPR signal. The other packets contribute to the <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetization</b> decay due to the homogeneous broadening. In this process all the spin in one spin packet experience the same magnetic field and interact with each other that can lead to mutual and random spin flip-flops. These fluctuations contribute to a faster fanning out of the magnetization vector.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first part}} of the pulse sequence, SS, {{achieves}} [...] "slice selection". A shaped pulse (shown here with a sinc modulation) causes a 90° nutation of longitudinal nuclear magnetization within a slab, or slice, creating <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetization.</b> The second part of the pulse sequence, PE, imparts a phase shift upon the slice-selected nuclear magnetization, varying with its location in the Y direction. The third part of the pulse sequence, another slice selection (of the same slice) uses another shaped pulse to cause a 180° rotation of transverse nuclear magnetization within the slice. This transverse magnetisation refocuses to form a spin echo at a time TE. During the spin echo, a frequency-encoding (FE) or readout gradient is applied, making the resonant frequency of the nuclear magnetization vary with its location in the X direction. The signal is sampled nFE times by the ADC during this period, as represented by the vertical lines. Typically nFE of between 128 and 512 samples are taken.|$|E

50|$|In {{magnetic}} resonance imaging or NMR of macromolecular samples, such as protein solutions, at least two types of water molecules, free (bulk) and bound (hydration), are present. Bulk water molecules have many mechanical degrees of freedom, and motion of such molecules thus exhibits statistically averaged behavior. Because of this uniformity, most free water protons have resonance frequencies very near the average Larmor frequency of all such protons. On a properly acquired NMR spectrum this {{is seen as a}} narrow Lorentzian line (at 4.8 ppm, 20 C). Bulk water molecules are also relatively far from magnetic field perturbing macromolecules, such that free water protons experience a more homogenous magnetic field, which results in slower <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetization</b> dephasing and a longer T2*. Conversely, hydration water molecules are mechanically constrained by extensive interactions with the local macromolecules and hence magnetic field inhomogeneities are not averaged out, which leads to broader resonance lines. This results in faster dephasing of the magnetization that produces the NMR signal and much shorter T2 values(<200 μs). Because the T2 values are so short, the NMR signal from the protons of bound water is not typically observed in MRI.|$|E
