50|$|Once {{the sound}} {{attenuation}} {{characteristics of the}} workstation pair are determined, {{it is necessary to}} determine whether sound masking is needed, and if so, how much. The figure on the right shows the final result for the design listed in the sections above. There are several variables. Voice level is first. Most people in offices speak at conversational (normal) levels. Raised levels can be used for speaker phone use. The gender of the speaker has only a small effect on intelligibility. The background level in the space is second. There are three choices. The first is a level and spectrum that is typical of well designed air handling systems. The second is the Walkaway Test. In an open area, a person reads text at normal voice levels and another backs away until he or she has difficulty understanding the text. The ceiling <b>tile</b> <b>array</b> can be used to determine the distance. That distance is entered and the typical background spectrum level is altered based on tests that had been made. The third is actual measurement. The level in dB(A) is entered and the typical background spectrum level is altered. The spectrum shape (not level) for the sound masking must be chosen. Choosing fixed opens a list of masking spectra used by various consultants and installers. from which the user must pick. The first two choices are the spectra shapes recommended in the sections above. A choice of Automatic allows the program to create a spectrum shape that attempts maximize privacy with minimum level. The privacy goal must then be entered as shown in the upper right. A choice of Confidential Privacy defaults to a Privacy Index (PI) of 95. A choice of Normal Privacy defaults to PI=80. The third choice permits any Privacy Index to be chosen as a goal. There are cases where the sound masking level is specified, so the fourth choice can be taken. At this point there are options for setting the masking level. The first is Tune; the chosen masking spectrum is visually adjusted in level until the chosen degree of privacy is obtained or the specified masking level is reached. Then the various privacy, level, and sound attenuation ratings are displayed. A second choice is available that performs the same task with each of the masking spectra in the database and displays the comparative results in a table.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} arc-jet tests {{in support of}} the Shuttle Orbiter Boundary Layer Transition flight {{experiment}} was conducted in the Channel Nozzle of the NASA Johnson Space Center Atmospheric Reentry Materials and Structures Facility. The boundary layer trip was a protrusion of a certain height and geometry fabricated as part of a 6 "x 6 " tile insert, a special test article made of the Boeing Rigid Insulation tile material and coated with the Reaction Cured Glass used for the bottom fuselage tiles of the Space Shuttle Orbiter. A total of five such tile inserts were manufactured: four with the 0. 25 -in. trip height, and one with the 0. 35 -in. trip height. The tile inserts were interchangeably installed {{in the center of the}} 24 "x 24 " variable configuration <b>tile</b> <b>array</b> mounted in the 24 "x 24 " test section of the channel nozzle. The objectives of the test series were to demonstrate that the boundary layer trip can safely withstand the Space Shuttle Orbiter flight-like re-entry environments and provide temperature data on the protrusion surface, surfaces of the nearby tiles upstream and downstream of the trip, as well as the bond line between the tiles and the structure. The targeted test environments were defined for the tip of the protrusion, away from the nominal surface of the <b>tile</b> <b>array.</b> The arc jet test conditions were approximated in order to produce the levels of the free stream total enthalpy at the protrusion height similar to those expected in flight. The test articles were instrumented with surface, sidewall and bond line thermocouples. Additionally, Tempilaq temperature-indicating paint was applied to the nominal tiles of the <b>tile</b> <b>array</b> in locations not interfering with the protrusion trip. Five different grades of paint were used that disintegrate at different temperatures between 1500 and 2000 deg F.

Two feasible technical paths to realize the function are discussed in this paper. The first one is to utilize a electronically steered array feed with a conventional parabolic reflector.

Acquisition and tracking functions can be realized economically by integrating a power detector based feedback system.

In particular, we introduce a simple model of a " shaped tile and derive the equations of motion for a system of such tiles from a model of the lateral forces between two oating colloidal particles.

40|$|Following {{the breakup}} of the Space Shuttle Columbia during reentry a NASA/Contractor {{investigation}} team was formed to examine the probable damage inflicted on Orbiter Thermal Protection System elements by impact of External Tank insulating foam projectiles. The authors formed a working subgroup within the larger team to apply the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics code SPHC to the damage estimation problem. Numerical models of the Orbiter's tiles and of the Tank's foam were constructed and used as inputs into the code. Material properties needed to properly model the tiles and foam were obtained from other working subgroups who performed tests on these items for this purpose. Two- and three-dimensional models of the tiles were constructed, including the glass outer layer, the main body of LI- 900 insulation, the densified lower layer of LI- 900, the Nomex felt mounting layer, and the Aluminum 2024 vehicle skin. A model for the BX- 250 foam including porous compression, elastic rebound, and surface erosion was developed. Code results for the tile damage and foam behavior were extensively validated through comparison with Southwest Research Institute foam-on-tile impact experiments carried out in 1999. These tests involved small projectiles striking individual tiles and small <b>tile</b> <b>arrays.</b> Following code and model validation we simulated impacts of larger foam projectiles on the examples of tile systems used on the Orbiter. Results for impacts on the main landing gear door are presented in this paper, including effects of impacts at several angles, and of rapidly rotating projectiles. General results suggest that foam impacts on tiles at about 500 mph could cause appreciable damage if the impact angle is greater than about 20 degrees. Some variations of the foam properties, such as increased brittleness or increased density could increase damage in some cases. Rotation up to 17 rps failed to increase the damage for the two cases considered. This does not rule out other cases in which the rotational energy might lead to an increase in tile damage, but suggests that in most cases rotation will not be an important factor...|$|R

Static tests were performed with the varying of support conditions from simply supported, pinned, and torqued bolts. The goal was to understand the change in strength and failure modes due to the joint under transverse loading. Optimization of the joint was also involved, thus the torque levels were also varied to conclude t he best torque level for performance of the joint. It was found out that the bolted joint improved the performance and strength of the DCCSS in comparison to the simply supported and pinned support conditions. The failure mode of the DCCSS changed with each support condition, but ultimate failure was consistently due to delamination between the adhesive interlayer and face sheet. The optimal torque level of 90 ft-lbs. was determined from static testing. The influence of fatigue on stiffness retention, residual strength and damage were also conducted for both pinned and torqued support conditions to study durability.

In this study specimens with 0. 5 inch pins are subjected to in-plane tensile loading statically to establish the sequence and severity of failure modes that occur in the tiles, face sheets and the bonding interlayer. Static testing was completed on various geometric ratios such as pin spacing and edge distance as well as the influence of tile gaps that exist in the discontinuous <b>tile</b> <b>array.</b> Specimens were also subjected to in-plane tensile fatigue loading to determine the fatigue sensitivity of the joints in the DCCS structure.

A review of literature is presented, giving a brief history of shape-memory polymers, an overview of current significant shape-memory polymer application, an overview of current morphing aircraft in morphing application and an overview of the current methods to activate shape-memory polymers. Analytical and finite element models are created to predict out-of-plane deformations caused by aerodynamic loads on an independently functioning sub-section of a <b>tile</b> <b>array</b> that would comprise the skin of a morphing aircraft.

40|$|The {{reconfigurable}} computing {{community has}} yet to be successful in allowing programmers to access FPGAs through traditional software development flows. Existing barriers that prevent programmers from using FPGAs include: 1) knowledge of hardware programming models, 2) the need to work within the vendor specific CAD tools and hardware synthesis. This thesis presents a series of published papers that explore different aspects of a new approach being developed to remove the barriers and enable programmers to compile accelerators on next generation reconfigurable manycore architectures. The approach is entitled Just In Time Assembly (JITA) of hardware accelerators. The approach has been defined to allow hardware accelerators to be built and run through software compilation and run time interpretation outside of CAD tools and without requiring each new accelerator to be synthesized. The approach advocates the use of libraries of pre-synthesized components that can be referenced through symbolic links in a similar fashion to dynamically linked software libraries. Synthesis still must occur but is moved out of the application programmers software flow and into the initial coding process that occurs when programming patterns that define a Domain Specific Language (DSL) are first coded. Programmers see no difference between creating software or hardware functionality when using the DSL. A new run time interpreter is introduced to assemble the individual pre-synthesized hardware accelerators that comprise the accelerator functionality within a configurable <b>tile</b> <b>array</b> of partially reconfigurable slots at run time. Quantitative results are presented that compares utilization, performance, and productivity of the approach to what would be achieved by full custom accelerators created through traditional CAD flows using hardware programming models and passing through synthesis...|$|E

Insertion of MMIC technology into antenna systems, particularly at millimeter wave frequencies using low power and low noise amplifiers in closed proximity to the radiating elements, offers a significant improvement in the array transmit efficiency, receive system noise figure, and overall array reliability. Application of active array technology also leads to the use of advanced beamforming techniques that can improve beam agility, diversity, and adaptivity to complex signal environments. The objective of this program was to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the 'tile' array packaging architecture at EHF via the insertion of 1990 MMIC technology into a functional <b>tile</b> <b>array</b> or subarray module.

Methods that allow the targeting of components to specific locations within these structures are therefore highly sought after. Here we report that the triplex approach to DNA recognition, which relies on the specific binding of an oligonucleotide within the major groove of double-helical DNA, can be exploited to recognize specific loci within a DNA double-crossover <b>tile</b> and <b>array,</b> a nanostructure assembled by crossover strand exchange. The oligonucleotide can be targeted to both crossover and non-crossover strands and, surprisingly, across the region spanning the crossover junction itself. Moreover, by attaching biotin {{to the end of}} the oligonucleotide, we show that streptavidin molecules can be recruited to precise locations within a DX array, with an average spacing of 31. 9 (± 1. 3) nm. This is a promising approach that could be exploited to introduce other components compatible with oligonucleotide synthesis into the wide variety of DNA nanostructures assembled by crossover strand exchange, such as those generated by DNA origami. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The use of DNA {{self-assembly}} {{to perform}} molecular computation is a promising field of research. DNA-based computation {{has the potential}} to perform large numbers of computations in parallel in a single solution. To this end, DX crystal growth can be designed to follow a series of algorithmic instructions. In these types of arrays, a nucleating strand functions to give a series of logical inputs, and crystal growth is determined by a set of designed logic rules implemented by a series of DX tiles with varying sticky ends. The error rate for tile incorporation is extremely important for these applications, as a single incorrectly incorporated tile can result in a cascade of errors, as subsequent binding events will be determined based on the erroneous tile. Prior work has required a subset of the DX tiles to be modified with dsDNA hairpins for AFM visualization, which may inadvertently affect the kinetics of binding and thus the error rate. By redesigning this system so that none of the tiles contain DNA hairpins, {{it may be possible to}} reduce the error rate. Polyamide-biotin conjugates targeted to specific sequences could be used to visualize a subset of <b>tiles</b> after <b>array</b> formation resulting i...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into {{the development of an}} ultrasound imaging system capable of customization for multiple applications via the tessellation of in-system programmable scalable modules, or tiles, is presented here. Each tile contains an individual ultrasonic array, operating at +/- 3. 3 V, which can be assembled into a larger ‘mosaic’ of multiple <b>tiles</b> to create <b>arrays</b> of any size or shape. The ability to form an imaging system from generic building blocks which are physically identical for manufacturing purposes yet functionally unique via programming to suit the application has many potential benefits in the field of ultrasonics. The system is primarily targeted at underwater sonar and non-destructive testing, as defined by the current excitation frequency, but the concept is equally applicable to applications in biomedical ultrasound...|$|R
