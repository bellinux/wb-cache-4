5|$|On 31 December 2014, Modi {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>Planning</b> Commission had been scrapped. It {{was replaced with}} a body called the National Institution for Transforming India, or NITI Aayog. <b>The</b> <b>Planning</b> Commission was {{a legacy of the}} Indian Independence movement, although critics said that it was slowing economic growth. The move had the effect of greatly centralising the power previously with <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> commission in the person of the prime minister. It also reduced the extent of control individual states had over their financial allocation from the union government, and unlike <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> commission, it does not have the power to allocate funds. <b>The</b> <b>planning</b> commission had received heavy criticism in previous years for creating inefficiency in the government, and of not filling its role of improving social welfare: however, since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.|$|E

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> {{approval}} was granted, {{local residents}} hired barristers to consider an appeal against the decision. The activation of <b>the</b> <b>planning</b> permission allowed solicitors {{on behalf of}} a group called Residents United Residents Association (RURA) to launch its Judicial Review Pre-Action Protocol, which challenged the council's decision making process. One of the original areas for appeal revolved around historic covenants on parts of the land, but the Charities Commission ruled that the fields are not charitable land.|$|E

In order to be confirmed over their objection <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> must not discriminate against that class of creditors, and <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> must be found fair and equitable to that class.|$|R
