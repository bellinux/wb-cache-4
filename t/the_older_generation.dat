5|$|The Heinz {{executive}} {{speaks with}} Don about his daughters' obsession with The Rolling Stones, and floats {{an idea about}} getting The Rolling Stones to do a commercial for Heinz. Don agrees, though he is unimpressed with the idea. Harry and Don make a Saturday night trip to a Rolling Stones concert to meet with Stones manager Allen Klein. They end up making conversation backstage with two pot-smoking female fans. When Harry leaves {{with one of the}} girls to talk with Klein, Don waxes poetic with one over her love for the band. She makes an insulting comment about <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>generation.</b> Don responds that <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>generation</b> is simply worried for youth. Harry fails miserably at his attempt to meet with The Rolling Stones, but Don is indifferent.|$|E
5|$|If {{you talk}} to people who perform a Burrakatha, you will see a huge {{difference}} in the way <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>generation</b> performs the art vis-à-vis the way the way the younger generation performs it... This has happened because of the advent of television. Burrakatha is a long-format art form. The point we are making is that if we don't protect these folk arts, they will be on their way out.|$|E
40|$|This {{exploratory}} study analysis the social personal networks of <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> <b>generation</b> in families with four living generations. A questionnaire to analyse the personal social network (IARSP-R) {{was administered to}} 23 participants, from <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> <b>generation</b> (G 1). Main findings show medium size networks, cohesive, homogeneous and family centred.

5|$|Old {{styles are}} {{considered}} slow, well-pronounced and dignified like the Maguindanao’s kamamatuan and the Maranao’s andung. Genres classified under this style have moderate tempos, are rhythmically oriented, balanced, lack many improvisations {{and are usually}} played by the older folks and are therefore always played first, to give due respect to <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Szabó's {{first feature}} film, The Age of Illusions (1964), is a partly autobiographical {{film about the}} struggles of Szabó’s {{generation}} in starting a career, encountering the obsolescence of <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>generation,</b> and establishing romantic relationships. The appearance of a poster for François Truffaut's The 400 Blows {{in the background of}} a scene suggested Szabó's artistic compatibility with Truffaut and the French New Wave. The film won the Silver Sail for Best First Work at the Locarno International Film Festival and a Special Jury Prize for Best Director at the Hungarian Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|Cardus's {{approach}} to cricket writing was innovative, turning what {{had previously been}} largely a factual form into vivid description and criticism; he is considered by contemporaries to have influenced every subsequent cricket writer. Although he achieved his largest readership for his cricket reports and books, he considered music criticism as his principal vocation. Without any formal musical training, he was initially influenced by <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>generation</b> of critics, in particular Samuel Langford and Ernest Newman, but developed his own individual style of criticism—subjective, romantic and personal, {{in contrast to the}} objective analysis practised by Newman. Cardus's opinions and judgments were often forthright and unsparing, which sometimes caused friction with leading performers. Nevertheless, his personal charm and gregarious manner enabled him to form lasting friendships in the cricketing and musical worlds, with among others Newman, Sir Thomas Beecham and Sir Donald Bradman.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the importance of}} life cycle aspects in explaining the evolution of regional income inequality. The analysis of household microdata organized in age cohorts shows that Brazilian regional income inequality has different dynamics across generations, with income convergence being observed only for <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>generations.</b> <b>The</b> larger income share of younger generations produces a low speed of convergence in the country. When retirement payments, pensions, and other government transfers are excluded from income, convergence is not observed even for <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>generations...</b>|$|R
50|$|A third {{fundamental}} {{contribution of}} OLG models {{is that they}} justify existence of money as a medium of exchange. A system of expectations exists as an equilibrium in which each new young generation accepts money from <b>the</b> previous <b>old</b> <b>generation</b> in exchange for consumption. They do this because they expect {{to be able to}} use that money to purchase consumption when they are <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>generation.</b>|$|R
5|$|Dissatisfaction {{became more}} evident during the 1880s, and some {{officers}} began to display open insubordination. The Emperor {{and the politicians}} did nothing to improve the military nor meet their demands. The dissemination of Positivist ideology among young officers brought further complications, as Positivism opposed the monarchy under the belief that a dictatorial republic would bring improvements. A coalition between a mutinous Army faction and the Positivist camp was formed and directly led to the republican coup on 15 November 1889. Battalions and even full regiments of soldiers loyal to the Empire, who shared the ideals of <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>generation</b> of leaders, attempted to restore the monarchy. Attempts at a restoration proved futile and supporters of the Empire were executed, arrested or forcibly retired.|$|E
5|$|The {{inspiration}} for Atheis came, according to Oemarjati, {{sometime during the}} early 1940s. In Mihardja's observations, Marxism–Leninism and anarcho-nihilism {{were among the most}} common ideologies in Indonesia; this led him to depict Rusli and Anwar as holding those ideologies. Meanwhile, emerging writers such as Idrus, Asrul Sani, and Chairil Anwar were increasingly critical of <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>generation</b> of Indonesian authors, whom they decried as narrow-minded and provincial. Mihardja, who was older than many contemporary writers and wrote in a similar style to the older authors, disliked this comparison; according to Maier, this may have led him to represent Chairil Anwar as a much-flawed character. Mihardja formalised his concept throughout the early 1940s and completed the writing during a period of unemployment from May 1948 until February 1949.|$|E
5|$|The {{relations}} between family members follow two patterns: {{the bonds of}} marriage serve mostly as Machiavellian means to financial ends, while the obligations of <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>generation</b> to the young {{take the form of}} sacrifice and deprivation. Delphine is trapped in a loveless marriage to Baron de Nucingen, a money-savvy banker. He is aware of her extramarital affairs, and uses them as a means to extort money from her. Anastasie, meanwhile, is married to the comte de Restaud, who cares less about the illegitimate children she has than the jewels she sells to provide for her lover– who is conning her in a scheme that Rastignac has heard was popular in Paris. This depiction of marriage as a tool of power reflects the harsh reality of the unstable social structures of the time.|$|E

40|$|We study {{contract}} design within an overlapping <b>generations</b> partner-ship firm. <b>The</b> <b>old</b> <b>generation</b> owns <b>the</b> firm, and designs the contract {{under which the}} young generation is hired. Young employees become partners with ownership rights, {{and the right to}} write to the contract with the next <b>generation,</b> when <b>the</b> <b>old</b> <b>generation</b> dies. This leads to a recursive problem in contract design. We show that this can lead to low wages and severe rent dissipation through excessive effort. Experimental results confirm the predictions of the model. Preliminary and incomplete. Please do not cite or circulate. ...|$|R

5|$|Rocksteady decided {{early on}} in {{development}} to make Arkham Knight only for the then-upcoming next-generation of consoles, which was considered {{to allow them to}} focus on using the system resources to their fullest without reining in their ideas to accommodate <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>generation</b> systems. The game allows for up to five times the number of on-screen enemies as were possible in Arkham City, and riots can feature up to fifty on-screen enemies interacting with the environment to smash items, and spray graffiti. The technical changes also allowed for cutscenes to be rendered in real time in the game engine, where previous installments had used pre-rendered videos to compensate. Describing the scale of difference between Arkham Knight and earlier games, lead character artist Albert Feliu said that a single character model in Arkham Knight could contain the same amount of polygons used to render the entirety of Arkham Asylums environment. Arkham Knight is the first in the series to use the Apex physics simulation engine to have items like cloth, such as Batman's cape, react realistically to movement or wind. Warner Bros. supported Rocksteady's concept for the game, but both parties felt that three years was too long to wait between games, so WB Games Montréal was tasked with creating the prequel, Arkham Origins, to fill the gap.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{perceptions}} of the Hinomaru exist in former colonies of Japan as well as within Japan itself, such as in Okinawa. In one notable example of this, on October 26, 1987, an Okinawan supermarket owner burned the Hinomaru {{before the start of}} the National Sports Festival of Japan. The flag burner, Shōichi Chibana, burned the Hinomaru not only to show opposition to atrocities committed by the Japanese army and the continued presence of U.S. forces, but also to prevent it from being displayed in public. Other incidents in Okinawa included the flag being torn down during school ceremonies and students refusing to honor the flag as it was being raised to the sounds of Kimigayo. In the capital city of Naha, Okinawa, the Hinomaru was raised for the first time since the return of Okinawa to Japan to celebrate the city's 80th anniversary in 2001. In the People's Republic of China and South Korea, both of which had been occupied by the Empire of Japan, the 1999 formal adoption of the Hinomaru was met with reactions of Japan moving towards the right and also a step towards re-militarization. The passage of the 1999 law also coincided with the debates about the status of the Yasukuni Shrine, US-Japan military cooperation and the creation of a missile defense program. In other nations that Japan occupied, the 1999 law was met with mixed reactions or glossed over. In Singapore, <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>generation</b> still harbors ill feelings toward the flag while the younger generation does not hold similar views. The Philippines government not only believed that Japan was not going to revert to militarism, but the goal of the 1999 law was to formally establish two symbols (the flag and anthem) in law and every state has a right to create national symbols. Japan has no law criminalizing the burning of the Hinomaru, but foreign flags cannot be burned in Japan. Some people have humorously drawn an analogy between the Japanese flag and the appearance of a menstruation stain on a white bedsheet.|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} {{whether and}} how memories and knowledge of World War II (WWII) transmit across generations. We recruited five French-speaking Belgian families and interviewed one member from each <b>generation.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> <b>generation</b> had to be alive during WWII, their interviews constituted "memories" while the interviews of the middle and youngest generation constituted "knowledge", as they were not alive during WWII. Each individual was asked about four WWII events specific to Belgium (two of which {{were likely to be}} controversial, i. e., collaboration and the Royal Question), and the source from which they learned about these four events: was it communicatively (e. g., through familial discussions) or culturally (e. g., social artifacts: books, school, monuments, etc.) transmitted? Our results suggest that transmission of memories and knowledge across <b>generations</b> was limited. <b>The</b> <b>oldest</b> <b>generation,</b> who were children during the war, and the middle generation knew about the WWII events discussed in the interviews, particularly <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> <b>generation.</b> <b>The</b> youngest generation, however, did not. Furthermore, for the most part, all generations, in discussing memories of the WWII events, told nationally relevant memories. If <b>the</b> <b>oldest</b> <b>generation</b> discussed personally relevant memories, these memories sometimes transmitted to the middle generation and rarely to the youngest. We discuss these results in terms of Assmann and Czaplicka's (1995; Assmann, 2011) distinction between communicative and cultural memory...|$|R
