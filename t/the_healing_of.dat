5|$|If after 2–4days {{there is}} still {{evidence}} of an air leak, various options are available. Negative pressure suction (at low pressures of –10 to –20cmH2O) at a high flow rate may be attempted, particularly in PSP; {{it is thought that}} this may accelerate <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>of</b> the leak. Failing this, surgery may be required, especially in SSP.|$|E
5|$|In {{extreme cases}} of {{intractable}} CSF leak, a surgical lumbar drain has been used. This procedure {{is believed to}} decrease spinal CSF volume while increasing intracranial CSF pressure and volume. This procedure restores normal intracranial CSF volume and pressure while promoting <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>of</b> dural tears by lowering the pressure and volume in the dura. This procedure has led to positive results leading to relief of symptoms for up to one year.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his fourth}} year as Thomaskantor (musical director) in Leipzig. The text {{is based on the}} day's prescribed reading from the Gospel of Mark, <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>of</b> a deaf mute man. The librettist is Georg Christian Lehms, whose poetry Bach had used already in Weimar as the basis for solo cantatas. The text quotes ideas from the gospel and derives from these the analogy that as the tongue of the deaf mute man was opened, the believer should be open to admire God's miraculous deeds. The cantatas for this Sunday have a positive character, which Bach stressed in earlier works for the occasion by including trumpets in the score. In this work, he uses instead an obbligato solo organ in several movements.|$|E
5|$|Gilberto's doctor {{ordered him}} to wear a back brace for three months to aid <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>of</b> the {{fractured}} bone. Gilberto returned to his native Brazil {{for the duration of}} his rehabilitation. During his time there, he doubted whether he would ever be able to play football again, due to speculation that his injury could threaten his career. Despite his concerns, his long rehabilitation time paid off as he made a full recovery. He made his footballing comeback in Arsenal's 4–1 victory over Norwich City on 22 April 2005. During the whole 2004–05 season, Gilberto was injured for 7 months and played only 17 games. His absence, combined with Arsenal's slump in form at the time, led to much discussion regarding the importance of Gilberto to the Arsenal team; some suggesting that Arsenal struggled without him. Gilberto's difficult 2004–05 season ended in consolation as Arsenal finished runners-up in the Premier League and won the FA Cup against Manchester United in a penalty shoot-out.|$|E

Friars, pilgrims and other common people are approaching the corpse to pay homage; on the sides are two richly dressed characters, identified as Riccomanno Bufalini (on the left, with a fur-lined hood and the gloves) and a member of his family. The remaining characters are used to portray a series of miracles attributed to Bernardino during his life: <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>of</b> a blind man(who hints at his eyes), the resurrection of someone possessed, <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>of</b> a dead newborn, <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>of</b> Lorenzo di Niccolò da Prato, wounded by a bull, and the pacification of the Umbrian families.|$|E

25|$|Dee was {{influenced}} by the Hermetic and Platonic-Pythagorean doctrines that were pervasive in the Renaissance. He believed that numbers were the basis of all things and the key to knowledge.

His ultimate goal was to help bring forth a unified world religion through <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>of</b> the breach of the Catholic and Protestant churches and the recapture of the pure theology of the ancients.|$|E
25|$|These methods all had merit, but the {{standard}} method for <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>of</b> fractures was bed rest and restriction of activity.

The ambulatory treatment of fractures was the direct result of these innovations. The innovation of the modern cast can be traced to, among others, four military surgeons, Dominique Jean Larrey, Louis Seutin, Antonius Mathijsen, and Nikolai Ivanovich Pirogov.|$|E

25|$|These {{scholars}} set out {{to demonstrate}} that Christians could hold their own in conversations with learned Greek-speaking intellectuals. They argued that Christian faith, while it was against many of the ideas of Plato and Aristotle (and other Greek Philosophers), it was an almost scientific and distinctive movement with <b>the</b> <b>healing</b> <b>of</b> the soul of man and his union with God at its center.

25|$|Pentecostals {{believe that}} prayer is central in {{receiving}} healing. Pentecostals look to scriptures such as James 5:13–16 for direction regarding healing prayer.
