5|$|After decisive Ottoman {{victory at}} the Battle of Krbava field in 1493, and {{especially}} after the Battle of Mohács in 1526, the Croats continued defending themselves against <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> attacks. <b>The</b> <b>Ottoman</b> conquest {{during the early years}} of the 16th century prompted the formation of the Uskoks, which were led by Croatian captain Petar Kružić, also called (Prince of Klis). As a part of the Habsburg defensive system, Uskoks used the base at Klis as an important defensive position. They fought almost alone against the Ottomans, and for more than two decades defended the fortress against <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> attacks.|$|E
5|$|After the {{invasion}} of Greece by <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> Turks, the area of Trachones {{was turned into a}} Chiflik, and administered according to <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> feudal system, with the local population becoming mandatory land peasants (koligoi).

25|$|<b>The</b> 1770 <b>Ottoman</b> Invasion of Mani {{was one of}} {{a series}} of invasions by <b>the</b> <b>Ottomans</b> to subdue <b>the</b> Maniots. Mani was one region of Greece that <b>the</b> <b>Ottomans</b> had not {{occupied}} due to the rough terrain and the rebellious spirit of Maniots. The Maniots caused damage to <b>the</b> <b>Ottomans</b> by allying with the Venetians whenever there was a war between Venice and <b>the</b> <b>Ottomans,</b> and also habitually engaged in piracy.|$|R

5|$|Amman was an {{important}} city on <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> lines of communication.

5|$|Despite this support, the {{economic}} resources of <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> Empire were depleted by {{the cost of}} the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 and the French, British and Germans had offered financial aid. A pro-German faction influenced by Enver Pasha, the former Ottoman military attaché in Berlin, opposed the pro-British majority in <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> cabinet and tried to secure closer relations with Germany. In December 1913, the Germans sent a military mission to Constantinople, headed by General Otto Liman von Sanders. The geographical position of <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> Empire meant that Russia and her allies France and Britain had a significant interest in Turkish neutrality in the event of war in Europe.|$|E
50|$|By 5:00 am, <b>the</b> <b>Ottomans</b> counter-attacked <b>the</b> Wellingtonians.

The New Zealanders fought desperately to hold off <b>the</b> <b>Ottomans,</b> firing their rifles and those of their fallen companions until the wood of the stock was too hot to touch. When <b>the</b> <b>Ottomans</b> got up to the trenches the fighting continued with <b>the</b> bayonet. <b>The</b> <b>Ottomans</b> overran part of the New Zealand trench and took some prisoners.

50|$|Ali Bey sent {{a man to}} the {{defenders}} offering to call off the siege if Kolokotronis and Panagiotaros each gave him one of their children. The Maniots refused and <b>the</b> <b>Ottomans</b> began <b>the</b> siege. <b>The</b> <b>Ottomans</b> had trouble bombarding the tower-houses because they were well built and had been strengthened before <b>the</b> <b>Ottomans</b> arrived.

50|$|In 1399, Selymbria fell to <b>the</b> <b>Ottomans,</b> marking their {{complete}} encirclement of Constantinople by land in Europe. Many contemporary observers believed {{from then}} on it was a mere {{matter of time before}} <b>the</b> <b>Ottomans</b> took <b>the</b> Byzantine capital. However, after their disastrous defeat at the hands of Timur <b>the</b> <b>Ottomans</b> returned Selymbria and several other possessions to the Byzantines in 1403.

5|$|Following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918, {{which ended}} {{the war on}} the Eastern Front between Imperial Russia and Imperial Germany, {{the main focus of}} <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> Army turned to the Anatolian provinces and territories lost in 1877–1878 during the Russo-Turkish War. <b>The</b> <b>Ottoman</b> Army {{embarked}} on a series of territorial conquests in the Caucasus beginning in northern Persia. Erzerum which had been captured by the Russians in 1916, was retaken on 24 March 1918, followed by Van on 5 April and later Batum, Kars and Tiflis. Reoccupation of these former possessions brought little strategic advantage to <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> Empire, compared with the potential benefits of military success in Palestine.|$|E

5|$|From {{the second}} half of the 18th century onwards, <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> Empire began to decline. The Tanzimat reforms of the 19th century, which had been instituted by Mahmud II, were aimed to modernise <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> state in line with the {{progress}} that had been made in Western Europe. The efforts of Midhat Pasha during the late Tanzimat era led <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> constitutional movement of 1876, which introduced the First Constitutional Era, but these efforts proved to be inadequate in most fields, and failed to stop the dissolution of the empire. As the empire gradually shrank in size, military power and wealth, especially after <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> economic crisis and default in 1875 which led to uprisings in the Balkan provinces that culminated into the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78, many Balkan Muslims migrated to the Empire's heartland in Anatolia, along with the Circassians fleeing the Russian conquest of the Caucasus. The decline of <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> Empire led to a rise in nationalist sentiment among its various subject peoples, leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into violence, such as the Hamidian massacres of Armenians.|$|E
5|$|However, the League of Lezhë {{defeated}} {{both the}} Venetian forces and <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> expedition. The League won over the Venetian forces on 23 July 1448 {{at the gates}} of Scutari, and over the Ottomans three weeks later, on 14 August 1448, at the Battle of Oronichea. The Republic was, thereafter, left with few soldiers to defend Venetian Albania. As a result, the League soon signed peace with the Republic of Venice, while continuing the war against <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> Empire. After the Albanian–Venetian War of 1447–1448, Venice did not seriously challenge Skanderbeg or the League, allowing Skanderbeg to focus his campaigns against <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> Empire.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, Abdülaziz became {{sultan of}} <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> Empire, and {{thereafter}} began a construction program to strengthen <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> Navy, which had incurred heavy losses during the Crimean War of 18531856.

50|$|Mubarak’s major {{defeat at}} Sarif {{severely}} threatened his rule. He requested on May 28, 1901 for British protectorate status (the British were still debating {{the meaning of}} the 1899 Agreement, and it was a secret anyway), but it was denied due to the international tensions surrounding Kuwait. <b>The</b> <b>Ottomans</b> tried to capitalize on Mubarak’s major defeat by deliberating a military solution to gain direct control of Kuwait. <b>The</b> <b>Ottomans</b> slowly realized that the growing British presence around Kuwait was a sign of Mubarak’s secret dealing with <b>the</b> British. <b>The</b> <b>Ottomans</b> attempted to firmly reestablish their control and influence by opening up customs and harbormaster posts. Through these posts <b>the</b> <b>Ottomans</b> tried to forcefully compel Mubarak to accept <b>the</b> new <b>Ottoman</b> presence, therefore showing real loyalty to <b>the</b> <b>Ottomans.</b> However, <b>the</b> British publicly reinforced Kuwait as they began solidifying {{the meaning of the}} 1899 Agreement.

5|$|In Constantinople, Allied {{military}} representatives {{pushed to}} threaten <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> {{government for the}} affair, while the French simultaneously explored the possibility of reaching a modus vivendi with Kemal.

Some of the delegates present, including Prime Minister David Lloyd-George, insisted that strong pressure should be brought to bear against <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> government to prevent new atrocities, but the other diplomats were skeptical of the idea. The officials also agreed that <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> government should dismiss Kemal from office, although they admitted that such a move was impractical, since <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> government held no control over Kemal, who was leading a counter Turkish government in Anatolia. A decision was finally reached on 10 March.

Gunfire from <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> ships, along with troops on the shore, made the Russian attack difficult. Sinop detonated her torpedo against a boat that was protecting Asar-i Tevfik, causing only minor damage to the ironclad, though the Russians initially believed they had sunk her. The ship was able to steam to Batumi, where she was repaired. The attackers had been aided by a fire burning on the beach, which illuminated <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> vessels in the harbor. <b>The</b> <b>Ottoman</b> fleet continued to support <b>the</b> <b>Ottoman</b> garrison at Batumi, when held out against constant Russian attacks {{to the end of}} the war.
