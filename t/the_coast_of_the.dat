5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was first observed {{east of the}} Bahamas on September6. It moved slowly northwestward towards <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States and attained hurricane strength early on September9. The cyclone continued travelling northwest along the US coast, becoming a Category 2 hurricane whilst {{off the coast of}} Georgia on September 11. On September 13 the cyclone made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, but then quickly weakened to a {{tropical storm}} and turned eastward into the Atlantic on September14. Throughout September15, whilst over water, the storm regained hurricane strength and continued northward before becoming extratropical in the mid-Atlantic on September17.|$|E

5|$|After death, {{the empty}} shell of this sea snail {{is often used}} by hermit crabs. On <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Caraguatatuba, Brazil, a study of shell use in the diogenid hermit crab species Isocheles sawayai was carried out. This study {{revealed}} that 11.5% {{of the population of}} these hermit crabs were using shells of Semicassis granulata. The occupation of shell type was reported as not being random, but was instead described as being influenced by the weight, size, shape and internal volume of the shell, the occurrence of epibionts such as bryozoans on the shell, and the degree of resistance the shell offered to predation and desiccation.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the British Admiralty and the US Navy {{analysed}} {{the captured}} {{records of the}} Japanese navy to account {{for all of its}} vessels. Their reports do not list any Japanese submarine losses off <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contiguous United States during the whole of the war. According to military records, the I-76 was destroyed off Buka Island in the western Pacific by USS Franks, USS Haggard and USS Johnston on 16 May 1944. Hubbard's crew however, who were very loyal to him, shared his conviction that they had engaged an enemy submarine. His second-in-command, Thomas Moulton, later asserted that the Navy had hushed up the incident, fearing that the presence of Japanese submarines so close to the Pacific coast might cause panic.|$|E

5|$|An oil tanker, {{also known}} as a {{petroleum}} tanker, is a merchant ship designed for the bulk transport of oil. There are two basic types of oil tankers: crude tankers and product tankers. Crude tankers move large quantities of unrefined crude oil from its point of extraction to refineries. For example, moving crude oil from oil wells in Nigeria to the refineries on <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States. Product tankers, generally much smaller, are designed to move refined products from refineries to points near consuming markets. For example, moving gasoline from refineries in Europe to consumer markets in Nigeria and other West African nations.|$|E
5|$|Aside from Dominica, other {{islands in}} the Lesser Antilles {{experienced}} minor to moderate damage. Just {{to the south of}} Dominica, David brought Martinique winds of up to 100 mph (160 km/h) and 140 mph (220 km/h) sustained gust in the northeast of <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Caravelle. The capital, Fort-de-France, reported wave heights of 15 feet (4.5 m) and experienced strong tropical storm sustained winds at 56 mph (90 km/h) and gust at 78 mph (126 km/h). David's strong winds caused severe crop damage, mostly to bananas, amounting to $50 million ($150 million in 2007 USD) in losses. Though no deaths were reported, the hurricane caused 20 to 30 injuries and left 500 homeless.|$|E
5|$|Australian and Papuan troops {{advanced}} along <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Huon Peninsula, using infantry, tanks, and {{air strikes}} against the Japanese positions, which were generally sited at creek crossings in the jungle. The advancing infantry kept strictly within range of the supporting artillery, which was liberally employed {{in the early stages}} of the operation. Using tactics that exploited the firepower of Australian artillery and armour, the Australian and Papuan troops inflicted heavy and disproportionate casualties on the Japanese as they advanced, ultimately linking up with the American forces at Saidor. Hundreds of Japanese soldiers were killed; thousands more died from disease, malnutrition, exhaustion and suicide. The Allies failed to seize the opportunity to completely destroy the Japanese forces.|$|E

5|$|Between 1847 and 1870, the {{population}} of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000. The Gold Rush wealth and population increase led to significantly improved transportation between California and the East Coast. The Panama Railway, spanning the Isthmus of Panama, was finished in 1855. Steamships, including those owned by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, began regular service from San Francisco to Panama, where passengers, goods and mail would take the train across the Isthmus and board steamships headed to the East Coast. One ill-fated journey, that of the S.S. Central America, ended in disaster as the ship sank in a hurricane off <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Carolinas in 1857, with approximately three tons of California gold aboard.|$|E
5|$|Diderot, Mirabeau and Vergniaud briefly {{participated in}} the {{occupation}} of Constantinople {{after the end of}} the war and the latter two ships were sent to the Black Sea in early 1919 during the Southern Russia Intervention. Vergniauds crew mutinied after one of its members was killed when a protest against intervention in support of the Whites was bloodily suppressed and forced the return of the French ships supporting the Whites. Mirabeau ran aground in February 1919 off <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crimea and could not be refloated until some of her guns and armor were removed.|$|E
5|$|During India's {{independence}} struggle, Gandhi {{launched the}} Dandi March along India's west coast to {{protest against the}} sales tax levied on salt extraction. His close associate C. Rajagopalachari, who would later become independent India's first Governor-General, carried out a salt march in parallel, {{on the east coast}} starting from Trichonopoly (modern day Tiruchirappalli) in Vedaranyam. His group, having people like Sardar Vedaratnam, started from Tiruchirappalli, in Madras Presidency (now part of Tamil Nadu), to <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town. After making illegal salt there on 30 April 1930, the group was arrested by the British.

5|$|Early in 1940, Steinbeck and Ricketts hired a Monterey Bay sardine fishing boat, the Western Flyer, with a four-man crew, {{and spent}} six weeks {{travelling}} <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of California collecting biological specimens. Along with Ricketts {{and the four}} crew members mentioned in the book, Steinbeck was accompanied by his wife, Carol. Steinbeck hoped that the trip would help rescue their failing marriage, {{but it seems to}} have had the opposite effect: the marriage ended soon after they returned. Steinbeck's lawyer and friend, Toby Street, was also on board as far as San Diego.|$|E
5|$|From the 13th to 20th century, {{there were}} Swedish-speaking {{communities}} in Estonia, {{particularly on the}} islands (e.g., Hiiumaa, Vormsi, Ruhnu; in Swedish, known as Dagö, Ormsö, Runö, respectively) along <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baltic, communities which today have all disappeared. The Swedish-speaking minority was represented in parliament, and entitled to use their native language in parliamentary debates. After the loss of Estonia to the Russian Empire in the early 18th century, around 1,000 Estonian Swedish speakers were forced to march to southern Ukraine, where they founded a village, Gammalsvenskby ("Old Swedish Village"). A few elderly people in the village still speak Swedish and observe the holidays of the Swedish calendar, although the dialect is most likely facing extinction.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Lili {{was one of}} {{only five}} Atlantic {{tropical}} cyclones on record to reach hurricane status in the month of December. The final of thirteen tropical storms in the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season, Lili developed as a subtropical cyclone which originated from a frontal trough to the south of Bermuda on December 12. It tracked southeastward, then northward, slowly attaining tropical characteristics and becoming a hurricane on December 20. Lili turned to the south and southwest, briefly threatening the northern Caribbean islands before weakening and dissipating near <b>the</b> <b>coast</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dominican Republic.
