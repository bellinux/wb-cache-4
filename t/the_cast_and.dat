5|$|At {{the taping}} of the episode, <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> crew passed around yearbooks, {{custom-made}} by the production staff, and signed them for each other. The cast gave the producers inscribed Cartier SA watches, while the producers gave the cast Neil Lane jewelry. As the sets were broken down, <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> crew each got {{a chunk of}} the street outside Central Perk in a glass box as a keepsake.|$|E
5|$|Coastal {{scenes were}} filmed at Bass Rock and near Trancas, while other scenes were filmed near Signal Hill. The film's climax was filmed {{around the area}} of the Union Station train depot. The large gas tank, which stood over 300 feet tall, was made {{available}} to <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> crew by the Southern California Gas Company. Filming at this location proved to be a challenge, as <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> crew had trouble communicating with each other, with Clarke attempting to direct the film crew while on top of the large structure.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:The {{temperature}} fields during semi-solid magnesium alloy produced by casting-rolling {{technology has been}} simulated by finite element method {{on the basis of}} ANSYS. The {{temperature fields}} for different conditions were obtained, which is consistent with the experimental results. Results show that there is a high temperature field in <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> rolling zone. <b>The</b> temperature fluctuates from the center to edge of the strip near the entry of <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> rolling zone. but The temperature decreases gradually from the center to edge of the strip near the exit of <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> rolling zone. There are some remarkable effects of the temperature of <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> rolling, <b>the</b> velocity of <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> rolling, <b>the</b> gap of two roll, the cooling of the roll and the diameter of the roll on the temperature field, which are in agreement with the experimental results...|$|R

50|$|Directional {{solidification}} (DS) {{and progressive}} solidification are types of solidification within castings. Directional solidification is solidification that occurs from farthest end of <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> works its way towards the sprue. Progressive solidification, {{also known as}} parallel solidification, is solidification that starts at the walls of <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> progresses perpendicularly from that surface.|$|R
40|$|The heat {{transfer}} during <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> solidification process includes the heat radiation of <b>the</b> high temperature <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mold, the heat convection between <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mold, {{and the heat}} conduction inside <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> from <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> to <b>the</b> mold. In this paper, a formula of time step in simulation of solidification is derived, considering the heat radiation, convection and conduction based on the conservation of energy. The different {{heat transfer}} conditions between <b>the</b> conventional sand <b>casting</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> permanent mold <b>casting</b> {{are taken into account}} in this formula. The characteristics of heat transfer in the interior <b>and</b> surface of <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> are also considered. The numerical experiments show that this formula can avoid computational dispersion, and improve the computational efficiency by about 20 % in the simulation of solidification process...|$|R

5|$|Surjik {{personally}} {{asked if}} he could direct the episode because he was a fan of the series; this was his only credit for the series. Filming the episode was difficult for <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> crew due largely {{to the fact that the}} script arrived for <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> crew to film only two days in advance. Other issues arose because of technical reasons; one scene required flooding a hallway with 3,300 gallons of water. Many of the scenes were filmed at Riverview Hospital, a mental health facility located in Coquitlam, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|A {{sing along}} {{edition of the}} film, hosted by Jordin Sparks, was {{released}} in select theaters on September 29 and October 2, 2010.

5|$|Hooper and Kim Henkel cowrote the {{screenplay}} and formed Vortex, Inc. with Henkel {{as president and}} Hooper as vice president. They asked Bill Parsley, a friend of Hooper, to provide funding. Parsley formed a company named MAB, Inc. through which he invested $60,000 in the production. In return, MAB owned 50% of the film and its profits. Production manager Ron Bozman told most of <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> crew {{that he would have}} to defer part of their salaries until after it was sold to a distributor. Vortex made the idea more attractive by awarding them a share of its potential profits, ranging from 0.25 to 6%, similar to mortgage points. <b>The</b> <b>cast</b> <b>and</b> crew were not informed that Vortex owned only 50%, which meant their points were worth half of the assumed value.|$|E
