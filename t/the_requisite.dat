Subjects were thirteen HIV/AIDS patients attended at a non-governmental organization in Fortaleza/CE, Brazil. We used interview techniques, physical examination, observation and information records, with a structured instrument, addressing requisites related to universal self-care, development and health alterations. Self-care deficits corresponded to nineteen nursing diagnoses, named according to NANDA’s Taxonomy II, ten of which were based on <b>the</b> <b>requisites</b> for universal self-care, five on <b>the</b> <b>requisites</b> for self-care related to development and four on <b>the</b> <b>requisites</b> for self-care related to health deviations.
