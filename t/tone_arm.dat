The old sound box with its needle-linked diaphragm was replaced by an electromagnetic pickup that converted the needle vibrations into an electrical signal. The <b>tone</b> <b>arm</b> now served to conduct a pair of wires, not sound waves, into the cabinet. The exponential horn was replaced by an amplifier and a loudspeaker.|$|E

Eight-inch (20cm) discs with a [...] label {{became popular}} {{for about a}} decade in Britain, but they cannot be played in full on most modern record players, since the <b>tone</b> <b>arm</b> cannot play far enough in toward the center without {{modification}} of the equipment.|$|E

50|$|The Minutoli is a {{phonograph}} turntable {{modified to}} support multiple (usually four) <b>tone</b> <b>arms.</b> The <b>tone</b> <b>arms</b> {{may be used}} independently and/or in combinations at the operator's discretion. The result is generally a unique performance, due to the random positions available. The device is mostly associated with Noise performer Emil Beaulieau as an instrument employed in his stage acts. It was invented by his friend, Michael Minutoli.|$|R
25|$|In the 1990s Rhino Records {{issued a}} series of boxed sets of 78rpm reissues of early rock and roll hits, {{intended}} for owners of vintage jukeboxes. The records were made of vinyl, however, {{and some of the}} earlier vintage 78rpm jukeboxes and record players (the ones that were pre-war) were designed with heavy <b>tone</b> <b>arms</b> to play the hard slate-impregnated shellac records of their time. These vinyl Rhino 78's were softer and would be destroyed by old juke boxes and old record players, but play very well on newer 78-capable turntables with modern lightweight <b>tone</b> <b>arms</b> and jewel needles.|$|R
2500|$|In the Scientology E-meter, {{the large}} control, {{known as the}} [...] "tone arm", adjusts the meter bias, while a smaller {{controls}} the gain. The operator manipulates the <b>tone</b> <b>arm</b> to keep the needle {{near the center of}} the dial so its motion is easily observed. A simple E-meter powered by direct current, such as that used by the Scientologists and the like, displays several kinds of electrodermal activity (EDA) on the one dial without distinction, including changes in conductance, resistance, and bioelectric potential. Researchers in psychophysiology are also exploring admittance and impedance aspects of EDA that can be observed only with alternating current.|$|E

5000|$|One of his inventions for the Foundation for the Blind was a {{turntable}} <b>tone</b> <b>arm</b> that descended {{slowly to}} the surface of a vinyl record. This prevented the possibility that a blind person might drop the arm accidentally and that the sudden fall might damage the stylus or the record. In later years, when he was designing the AR turntable, he added this same feature to the <b>tone</b> <b>arm.</b> In the ads describing the advantages of the product, the photo showed a person accidentally dropping the <b>tone</b> <b>arm,</b> with a caption noting that this turntable was [...] "For butterfingers." ...|$|E

50|$|Clear Audio Electronic GmbH of Germany is a {{manufacturer}} of high fidelity audio products. Formed in 1978, their primary focus is on vinyl turntables and related products such as cartridges. One of the particularly recognisable traits of a Clearaudio turntable are their transparent (or in some models translucent) acrylic components. The more expensive turntables showcase parallel tracking rather than pivot based <b>tone</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>tone</b> <b>arm</b> (or tonearm) {{holds the}} pickup {{cartridge}} over the groove, the stylus tracking the groove with the desired force {{to give the}} optimal compromise between good tracking and minimizing wear of the stylus and record groove. At its simplest, a <b>tone</b> <b>arm</b> is a pivoted lever, free to move in two axes (vertical and horizontal) with a counterbalance to maintain tracking pressure.|$|E

50|$|After graduation, Itsines {{found work}} at a women's gym in Adelaide. She soon {{observed}} that the machine-based classes she was leading there did not help her clients achieve their goals. One day, she led the class through a routine of aerobic exercises instead of using the machines, and saw that they loved it. Itsines {{came to believe that}} most women seek three specific outcomes from training: smaller inner thighs, flatter abdomens, and more <b>toned</b> <b>arms,</b> while also being concerned about becoming too bulky.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{materials}} in the 19th century were hardened rubber, wax, and celluloid, but early in the 20th century a shellac compound became the standard. Since shellac is not hard enough to withstand the wear of steel needles on heavy <b>tone</b> <b>arms,</b> filler made of pulverized shale was added. Shellac was also fragile, and records often shattered or cracked. This was a problem for home records, but it became a bigger problem in the late 1920s with the Vitaphone sound-on-disc motion picture [...] "talkie" [...] system, developed in 1927.|$|R
50|$|A face cam that {{implements}} three outputs for {{a single}} rotational input is the stereo phonograph, where a relatively constant lead groove guides the stylus and <b>tone</b> <b>arm</b> unit, acting as either a rocker-type (<b>tone</b> <b>arm)</b> or linear (linear tracking turntable) follower, and the stylus alone acting as the follower for two orthogonal outputs to representing the audio signals. These motions are in a plane radial to {{the rotation of the}} record and at angles of 45 degrees to the plane of the disk (normal to the groove faces). The position of the <b>tone</b> <b>arm</b> was used by some turntables as a control input, such as to turn the unit off or to load the next disk in a stack, but was ignored in simple units.|$|E

5000|$|The Decca International tone arm: The Decca International <b>tone</b> <b>arms</b> were fluid-damped unipivot designs. They were {{designed}} to complement the Decca phono cartridges. They would enjoy a brief renaissance {{in the 21st century}} as they were almost a drop-in replacement for the pick-up arms of Lenco GL75 record turntables from the 1970s. The arm damping was via a viscous silicone fluid held in a well, and magnetic repelling force supported the arm, and provided anti-skate (bias compensation). New Old Stock arms rapidly sold out by 2008 as vintage hifi enthusiasts sought them for refurbishment projects.|$|R
50|$|Nakamichi {{was founded}} by Etsuro Nakamichi in 1948 as Nakamichi Research Corporation Ltd (中道研究所株式会社 Nakamichi Kenkyujo Kabushiki Kaisha) in Tokyo Japan. It {{specialised}} in manufacturing portable radios, <b>tone</b> <b>arms,</b> speakers, and communications equipment. It was later headed by the founder's younger brother Niro Nakamichi. The company was originally established as a research and development firm in electronics and optics but later became known as a manufacturer of quality audio products. While its cassette decks were particularly well known, {{the company is also}} credited with audio innovations, such as self-centering record players, high-end DAT recorders, and ultra-compact slot-loading CD changers.|$|R
50|$|Album sets of {{the past}} were sequenced for record changers. In {{the case of a}} two-record set, for example, sides 1 and 4 would be stamped on one record, and sides 2 and 3 on the other. The user would stack the two records onto the spindle of an {{automatic}} record changer, with side 1 on the bottom and side 2 (on the other record) on top. Side 1 would automatically drop onto the turntable and be played. When finished, the <b>tone</b> <b>arm's</b> position would trigger a mechanism which moved the arm out of the way, dropped the record with side 2, and played it. When both records had been played, the user would pick up the stack, turn it over, and put them back on the spindle—sides 3 and 4 would then play in sequence. Record changers were used for many years of the LP era, but eventually fell out of use.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>tone</b> <b>arm</b> must {{track the}} groove without {{distorting}} the stylus assembly, so an ideal arm {{would have no}} mass, and frictionless bearings, requiring zero force to move it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company is}} notable for its 3009 and 3012 (9" [...] and 12" [...] respectively) <b>tone</b> <b>arms</b> which were widely adopted for audiophile and {{broadcast}} {{use during the}} 1960s and 1970s, at the higher end of the market. These arms featured a polished, bright-anodised aluminium [...] main tube with a lightweight headshell, knife edge horizontal bearings, and an anti skating bias provided by a weight that hung by a nylon filament. Versions were produced with both fixed and interchangeable headshells; the SME headshell mount became the de facto industry standard, and is still widely used today on consumer and especially DJ decks. Audiophile arms today tend to not use the SME mount, {{but this is not}} due to other standards replacing the SME but because audiophile arms now tend to not have interchangeable headshells at all in an effort to reduce mass and improve rigidity, though at slight expense of user flexibility. [...] Some cartridges were produced that mounted directly into the SME headshell mount of the arm (rather than into a headshell), notably from Ortofon.|$|R

50|$|The {{low mass}} and damped {{suspension}} of the <b>tone</b> <b>arm</b> itself compensated for any irregularities {{on the surface of}} the disk so that even warped records could often be played without distortion. When released, the <b>tone</b> <b>arm</b> floated down to the record, so that if it were dropped, it would not crash into the disc (which could harm both the needle and the record). With its quiet motor and precision-ground rubber drive belt, the turntable had extremely low wow and flutter (the lowest of any turntable on the market at that time), and far exceeded the National Association of Broadcasters (National Association of Broadcasters) standards for turntable measurements. The overall look of the turntable was given an award by Industrial Design magazine.|$|E

40|$|Rationale: Exposure to {{particulate}} matter {{is associated with}} risk of cardiovascular events, possibly through endothelial dysfunction, and indoor air may be most important. Objectives: We investigated effects of controlled exposure to indoor air particles on microvascular function (MVF) as the primary end-point and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress as secondary endpoints in a healthy elderly population. Methods: A total of 21 nonsmoking couples participated in a random-ized, double-blind, crossover study with two consecutive 48 -hour exposures to either particle-filtered or nonfiltered air (2, 533 – 4, 058 and 7, 718 – 12, 988 particles/cm 3, respectively) in their homes.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} which aspects would be essential to the neurological examination (NE) in a given specific situation (a patient referred with a potential neurological complaint, but the history suggests that a neurological problem is unlikely), we presented the same questionnaire used by Moore and Chalk in Canada to 19 neurologists in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We considered significant aspects of NE, whose average responses were {{greater than or equal}} to 3. 5 : visual fields, fundoscopy, pursuit eye movements, facial muscle power testing, gait, pronator drift or rapid arm movement in upper limbs, finger-nose, <b>tone</b> in <b>arms</b> and legs, five tendon reflexes, and plantar responses.

40|$|The blood {{pressure}} in both arms of 103 unselected hemiplegic patients was measured using a random-zero sphygmomanometer. Although for the whole sample the mean {{blood pressure}} in the paretic and unaffected arm was similar, a {{significant difference was found}} when the patients were subdivided according to the <b>tone</b> of the <b>arm.</b> The blood pressure was higher in paretic arms of patients with a spastic stroke and lower in the affected <b>arm</b> if the <b>tone</b> was flaccid. No other characteristics were associated with significant blood pressure differences, so that the findings appear to be directly related to changes in muscle tone. After a stroke the blood pressure should always be measured in the unaffected arm because changes in tone make measurements unreliable...|$|R
