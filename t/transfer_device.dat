25|$|Patient {{transfer}} devices generally allow {{patients with}} impaired mobility {{to be moved}} by caregivers between beds, wheelchairs, commodes, toilets, chairs, stretchers, shower benches, automobiles, swimming pools, and other patient support systems (i.e., radiology, surgical, or examining tables). The most common devices are Patient lifts (for vertical transfer), Transfer benches, stretcher or convertible chairs (for lateral, supine transfer), sit-to-stand lifts (for moving patients from one seated position to another i.e., from wheelchairs to commodes), air bearing inflatable mattresses (for supine transfer i.e., transfer from a gurney to an operating room table), and sliding boards (usually used for transfer from a bed to a wheelchair). Highly dependent patients who cannot assist their caregiver in moving them often require a Patient lift (a floor or ceiling-suspended sling lift) which though invented in 1955 and in common use since the early 1960s is still considered the state-of-the-art <b>transfer</b> <b>device</b> by OSHA and the American Nursing Association.|$|E

AIM: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the preventive effects of training and use of <b>transfer</b> <b>devices</b> for reported over-exertion back injuries among nursing personnel involved in patient transfer. RESULTS: Nurses who transferred patients once or more per shift had an increased relative risk (RR= 3. 3, 95 %CI= 2. 2 - 5. 1). Nurses who had got training in how to use the <b>transfer</b> <b>devices</b> on their own ward showed a lower relative risk for patient transfer (RR= 1. 6, CI=O. 9 - 2. 8) compared to nurses without training (RR= 6. 0, CI= 3. 0 - 12. 0). Also the use of <b>transfer</b> <b>devices</b> in ~ 1 / 4 of all patient transfers, reduced the relative risk (RR=l. S, CI=O. 6 - 3. 4) compared to nurses who seldom used devices (RR= 3. 9, CI= 2. 3 - 6. 6) DISCUSSION: The results show the importance of training the nurses in how to use the <b>transfer</b> <b>devices</b> on their wards and to encourage the nurses to use the <b>transfer</b> <b>devices</b> frequently during patient transfer.

He leaves SPHIA and waits; the transfer occurs, and the third transfer point appears, {{in which there is a}} large cubical structure. The player can enter using the key from Satoru's room, or wait outside. If Satoru enters, he finds it empty except for a bed and a black sphere. The Enomoto of 2011 enters the structure, asking Satoru for his name; Satoru answers, after which Enomoto panics, saying that [...] "the project" [...] is ruined. He says that Satoru's memory has been transplanted from someone called [...] "That Guy", that the sphere is the <b>transfer</b> <b>device,</b> and that the third transfer point is a relay between the mountain and the island, to level air pressure during transfers; he also reveals that this was where Utsumi was when she was hospitalized in 2011. Another person, who is identical to Satoru, enters and stabs Satoru. While Satoru dies, the killer calls the person thought to be Enomoto [...] "Satoru", who in turn calls the killer [...] "Enomoto".|$|E

40|$|Mechanical Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems {{account for}} 60 % {{of the total}} energy {{consumption}} of buildings. As a sector, buildings contributes about 40 % of the total global energy demand. By using passive technology coupled with natural ventilation from wind towers, significant amounts of energy can be saved, reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. In this study, the development of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis in aiding the development of wind towers was explored. Initial concepts of simple wind tower mechanics to detailed design of wind towers which integrate modifications specifically to improve the efficiency of wind towers were detailed. From this, using CFD analysis, heat <b>transfer</b> <b>devices</b> were integrated into a wind tower to provide cooling for incoming air, thus negating the reliance on mechanical HVAC systems.
