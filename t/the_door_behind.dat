5|$|In the Crystal City, Virginia {{headquarters}} of the software company Eurisko, founder Brad Wilczek {{and chief executive officer}} Benjamin Drake argue about downsizing measures. After Wilczek leaves, Drake writes a memo proposing to shut down the Central Operating System, a computer which runs the Eurisko Building. Seeing this through a surveillance camera, the COS sets up a trap and lures Drake into a bathroom, locking <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> him. Drake tries to use his keycard to open it, but it rejects the card. When he inserts a manual override key, he is fatally electrocuted.|$|E

5|$|At the FBI safe house, {{a police}} car arrives with Modell. Modell enters the room that Linda is in and locks <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> him. Mulder tells Scully {{the news of the}} therapist's death and urges her to keep Linda away from a phone. At the safe house, Skinner finds Linda's room door locked. He kicks the door down to find Modell and Linda, with Modell calmly saying that he has a gun. Without hesitation, Skinner shoots Modell when he sees a gun in Modell's hand, but once he is on the ground Skinner sees that his hand is curled into the shape of the gun.|$|E

5|$|After Skinner and Scully {{find and}} {{retrieve}} Praise, Skinner takes {{him to the}} nearest hospital, where his friend Thea visits him, closing <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> her. In search for Mulder in the desert, Scully sees a bright light in the sky which she thinks is a spaceship, but which is later revealed to be a helicopter. The helicopter lands and Doggett insists Scully travel {{with him to the}} hospital; she reluctantly accepts. At the hospital, two other FBI agents assure the two agents that nothing has happened to Praise; however, they soon discover that he has vanished. Scully leaves to search for Praise, while Doggett stays in an attempt to catch the intruder. He checks the ceiling space, where he finds Skinner badly injured. Meanwhile, Scully finds Praise, along with Skinner, who claims to be protecting the boy. Skinner, who is actually the Alien Bounty Hunter, attempts to kill her but Scully grabs her gun and shoots him in the neck, killing the Bounty Hunter. After Doggett reports the case to Kersh, he is assigned to the X-File division with Scully. The episode ends showing Mulder still held in captivity as six Alien Bounty Hunters look on.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife (Agi Szirtes), and tells her that Brown is under {{suspicion}} for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin she found a man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear locked the door and ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell anyone, and leaves for the hut. He unlocks the door, and receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, steps inside, closing <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind.</b> Minutes later he re-emerges, breathing heavily. After pausing to compose himself, he locks the door and leaves. In the next scene, Maloin presents the briefcase to Morrison in the tavern, and asks him to arrest him, confessing to having killed Brown an hour ago. Morrison leaves with Maloin for the hut, dismissing the frenzied inquiries of Brown's wife about her husband and handing the briefcase to the barkeep on the way out. Brown's wife follows the men to the hut, and emerges weeping with Morrison moments later. Back at the tavern, Morrison prepares two envelopes with {{a small portion of}} the recovered money in each. One he leaves with the grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well, while the other he gives to Maloin, telling him that his case was one of self-defense. As he is preparing to leave, Morrison advises Maloin to go home and forget the whole affair. The camera focuses on the expressionless face of Brown's wife momentarily before fading to white.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, Milligan played {{games with}} the medium itself. Whole scenes were written in which {{characters}} would leave, close <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> themselves, yet still be inside the room. Further to this, characters would announce their departure, slam a door, {{but it would be}} another character who had left the room. That character would then beat on the door for re-admittance, the door would open and close and again the wrong character would be locked out.|$|E
25|$|Thus, in 1345, {{hearing of}} the Pope's reversal, a group of noble conspirators (probably {{including}} Queen Joan) determined to forestall Andrew's coronation. During a hunting trip at Aversa, Andrew left his room {{in the middle of}} the night and was set upon by the conspirators. A treacherous servant barred <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> him; and as Joan cowered in their bed, a terrible struggle ensued, Andrew defending himself furiously and shrieking for aid. He was finally overpowered, strangled with a cord, and flung from a window. The horrible deed would taint the rest of Joan's reign.|$|E

Despite appearances, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> him is on a different plane from the ticket window. The rectangular structure behind the trombonist (to the right), defines the edge of the platform and shows the admission price. Above the poster is the gas pipe support beam. The trombonist stands shadowed on a pedestal (left of the central stairs) several meters in front of the platform, illuminated from the rear. While the tuba player is faceless, the red faces of the clarinetist and cornet players show that they stand on the gaslit platform.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{comes into}} the basement, {{releases}} Naomi and quickly save Jensen's life. As Naomi and Jensen are about to escape, Naomi quickly runs back upstairs to get her grandfather and Jensen finds something shocking: Naomi's grandfather has been dead for quite a while. Those who were shown talking with the grandfather were really talking to themselves. Suddenly, his body rises up and surprises Jensen, revealing one of the Skull Heads controlling his body. Jensen runs back downstairs, grabs Kimi's gun, shoots at Carver and Lisbeth near the exit (which has no anvil) and quickly runs outside, shutting <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>behind</b> him. Just as he thinks it's all over, a screaming Naomi opens <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> grabs Jensen and pulls him back in, slamming <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>behind</b> her, leaving <b>the</b> fate of Jensen unknown.|$|R

25|$|In 1946, {{the company}} {{introduced}} their B-series of bus chassis, {{with the engine}} mounted above the front-axle, giving a short front overhang and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> the front-axle. The first generation consisted of the B15/B16, the B20/B21/B22 and the B31, primarily divided by weight class, and then by wheelbase. The latter became upgraded in 1948 and renamed 2B20/2B21/2B22 and 3B31. The T31/T32 trolleybus chassis was also available from 1947. In 1950, the next generation was introduced, with the B41/B42, the B61/B62/B63/B64 and later the B83. From then, Scania-Vabis also offered the BF-series chassis, available as BF61/BF62/BF63, which had the engine more conventionally mounted before the front-axle, leaving room for the door on a longer front overhang. From 1954, the B-series came as B51 and B71, and the BF as BF71 and later BF73. In 1959, the B55, B65 and B75, plus the BF75 were introduced, and were from 1963 available as B56, B66 and B76, plus the BF56 and BF76.|$|E
25|$|Nicholas {{wakes up}} to find himself entombed alive in a {{cemetery}} in Mexico. He sells his gold watch to escape. He returns to find his mansion foreclosed {{and most of his}} possessions removed. He retrieves a hidden gun and seeks the aid of his ex-wife. While talking with her and apologizing for his neglect and mistreatment, he discovers that Jim Feingold, the CRS employee who had conducted his psychological tests, is an actor working in television advertisements. Nicholas locates Feingold and forces him to find CRS's real office, whereupon he takes Christine hostage. Nicholas demands to be taken to the leader of CRS. Attacked by CRS troops, Nicholas takes Christine to the roof and bars <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> them. The CRS troops begin cutting through the door. Christine realizes that Nicholas's gun is not a prop and is terrified. She frantically tells Nicholas that the conspiracy is a hoax, a fiction that is just part of the game, that his finances are intact, and that his family and friends are waiting {{on the other side of}} the door. He refuses to believe her. The door bursts open, and Nicholas shoots the first person to emerge—Conrad, bearing an open bottle of champagne. Devastated, Nicholas leaps off the roof, just as his late father did.|$|E
25|$|The wounded Emery {{suggests}} that Annie {{be killed in}} order to allow everyone to escape, alarming the rest of the group. While in the kitchen, Cathy Kramer is attacked by Mrs. Waterman and is rescued by Nick. The two decide to tie up the deranged woman and leave her in the kitchen. They agree not to inform Emery so that the unstable young man does not become more unbalanced. A ghostly Sukeena appears and drags Mrs. Waterman off into the dark wine cellar. As Nick and Cathy head back toward the main hall, the house changes around them and they become lost. A mysterious shape under the carpet chases them, and they flee. The shape begins to catch up to them, and Nick shoves Cathy into a room and slams <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> her, turning around {{just in time to see}} a skeletal monster rushing up to him. With silence in the hallway, Cathy opens the door again but finds no sign of Nick or the entity in the empty hallway. As the house continues to change around her, Cathy ends up in the attic. Suddenly overcome by the urge to automatically write, she witnesses the murder of John Rimbauer by Ellen and Sukeena. Steve and Rachel, meanwhile, decide to look for Nick and Cathy. They find Cathy in the attic, where she is about to be attacked by a corpse-like creature. Their presence seemingly prevents the house from acting, and the corpse drops lifeless to the floor. The corpse's withered arm lets them deduce that the carcass is that of Steven's missing great-aunt (and Ellen's daughter), April Rimbauer. Suddenly, April's corpse releases a bright white light from its mouth and instantly disintegrates.|$|E

500|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I Stuart was called up to service, as {{an officer in the}} Royal Naval Reserve. He was originally posted as a junior officer on board the old and obsolete destroyer HMS Opossum in Plymouth. This ship was used for harbour patrols and intercepting neutral merchant ships and other work Stuart considered tedious. He became increasingly impatient with the life and repeatedly applied to his senior officers with requests for transfer; at one point he even requested that he be commissioned into the army. All of these were turned down, with increasing levels of hostility from his commanders, one of whom was reported to have told him to [...] "Go to hell! And shut <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> you!" ...|$|E
500|$|That evening, Hari reappears in his quarters. This time Kelvin calmly accepts her {{and they}} fall asleep {{together}} in an embrace. Kelvin later causes her to panic by suddenly leaving the room and shutting <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> him. [...] She hysterically tears {{her way through the}} room's metal door, severely cutting herself. [...] Before he can give first aid, her injuries spontaneously heal before his eyes. [...] Dr. Sartorius (Anatoli Solonitsyn) calls for a meeting, and Kelvin introduces Hari as his wife. [...] In their symposium, the scientists explain to Kelvin that Solaris created Hari from his memories of her. [...] The Hari present among them, though not human, thinks and feels as though she were. [...] Sartorius theorizes that the visitors are composed of [...] "neutrino systems" [...] but that it might still be possible to destroy them through use of an offscreen device known as [...] "the annihilator".|$|E
500|$|The Doctor {{temporarily}} {{brings the}} two Amys {{into the same}} time stream by having them synchronise their thoughts whilst having Rory manipulate the time engines. Rory's glasses begin to malfunction due to feedback from the paradox, forcing {{the three of them}} to race through the complex amongst several Handbots to reach the TARDIS without the Doctor's assistance. [...] As they near its location, the older Amy falls back to protect the other two, but the younger Amy runs into a Handbot and is sedated. As the older Amy covers his back, Rory takes the younger Amy into the TARDIS. Once they are inside the Doctor slams <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> them and admits to Rory that it is impossible for both Amys to exist in the same timestream. Rory must now choose which Amy he wants. Rory and the older Amy have a tearful farewell at the TARDIS door before the older Amy tells him to move on without her. The older Amy then allows herself to be taken by the Handbots. Amy wakes up and asks [...] "Where is she?", and the Doctor leaves Rory to explain to her.|$|E

500|$|Fourth Amendment protections {{expanded}} {{significantly with}} Katz v. United States (1967). In Katz, the Supreme Court expanded that focus to embrace an individual's right to privacy, and {{ruled that a}} search had occurred when the government wiretapped a telephone booth using a microphone attached {{to the outside of}} the glass. While there was no physical intrusion into the booth, the Court reasoned that: 1) Katz, by entering the booth and shutting <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>behind</b> him, had exhibited his expectation that [...] "the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world"; and 2) society believes that his expectation was reasonable. Justice Potter Stewart wrote in the majority opinion that [...] "the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places". A [...] "search" [...] occurs for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when the government violates a person's [...] "reasonable expectation of privacy." [...] Katz's reasonable expectation of privacy thus provided the basis to rule that the government's intrusion, though electronic rather than physical, was a search covered by the Fourth Amendment, and thus necessitated a warrant. The Court said that it was not recognizing any general right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment, and that this wiretap could have been authorized if proper procedures had been followed.|$|E
