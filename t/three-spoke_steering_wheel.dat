5|$|For certain markets like China, where Camry sits {{right below}} similar-sized Mercedes-Benz cars as a luxury model, it is {{important}} for the Aurion to exemplify the traits of such vehicles. With the development of the Aurion, designers produced two separate philosophies, each pitched at a specific niche of the market. The base model AT-X, and luxury Prodigy and Presara variants employ the comfort design, with the more aggressive sports-oriented style found on the Sportivo versions. To meet this requirement, the Sportivo variants feature unique 17-inch alloy wheels, a rear spoiler, body kit appendages, and a <b>three-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> The high-performance TRD models offer a similar sports-oriented design, but are distinguishable by the use of unique body parts. These include a redesigned Formula One-inspired front bumper, with integrated foglamps, a unique rear bumper with fixed tailpipes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} {{appointments to}} the car focused both on driver involvement and comfort. A digital speedometer, surrounded by a tachometer and a boost gauge, replaced the regular analog instrument cluster, and was used until the March 1985 facelift, after which the analog assembly from the regular City was used. Form fitting, leather and moquette bucket seats were made standard as well and a special [...] "sonic seat" [...] was available, which responded to the audio system by a transducer sending sound and vibration to the user through the seat. An extra thick, <b>three-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> was also standard Turbo fitment.|$|E
2500|$|The sports-oriented model, {{known as}} the [...] "SE" [...] in North America and [...] "Sportivo" [...] in Australasia, was {{developed}} by Toyota Australia. It features a black [...] "honeycomb" [...] grille, black-tinted head and fog lamps, rear lip spoiler, body kit appendages, and a lower ride height coupled with wider and larger 17-inch diameter wheels. To increase rear-end downforce, the SE/Sportivo includes additional rear floor and fuel tank undercovers. Handling-specific upgrades see the use of firmer shock absorbers, a rise in spring rate, thicker anti-roll bars, additional floor and body side bracing, and a [...] "V"-brace behind the rear seat (which prevents the rear seat from folding down, offering a ski-pass only). Interior changes include charcoal-colored sports fabric and a leather-wrapped <b>three-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> In addition to the sports-oriented suspension setup, Toyota Australia's standard-grade suspension calibration has also been adopted by New Zealand, the Middle East and North America. The suspension geometry consists of independent MacPherson struts, L-arms, coil springs, gas dampers and a ball-jointed stabilizer bar at the front, with the rear setup comprising dual-link independent MacPherson struts with coil springs, gas dampers and ball-jointed stabilizer bar.|$|E

50|$|What did {{apply to}} all American cars in 1967 {{was the use of}} a dual-circuit braking system with a dual-chambered master cylinder. Increased {{awareness}} of passenger safety resulted in such innovations as safety-padded windshield pillars and an unusual 1967-only safety pad which protruded {{from the center of the}} <b>three-spoked</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> to a point just beyond the rim of the <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> It was designed to minimize abdominal injuries in the event of a collision.|$|R
50|$|The {{new engine}} has the extra {{refinement}} in running noticeable {{in the other}} new Austin units and shows much improvement on the former Twenty. The horn button and the signalling lever are {{on the top of}} the thin <b>three-spoked</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> The brake lever is inverted and under the dash. Accessible it does not interfere with entrance and has a thumb-plate trigger. The greatest comfortable speed was 70 miles per hour.|$|R
2500|$|The 1968 Caprice {{received}} a minor facelift {{that included a}} new grille with taillights set into the bumper and optional hidden headlamps. Caprice coupes now came standard with the new Astro Ventilation system, which included extra vents in the dash, {{and the removal of}} vent (wing) windows. Side marker lamps became standard on all U.S. cars and the Caprice carried over the optional white corner marker lamps at the forward edge of the fenders in addition to the amber parking lights which were illuminated with the headlights. All 1968 Chevrolets got front side marker lights on the fender; cars with an optional engine were identified with its cubic inch displacement listed on half the bezel; the light itself occupied the other half. The fiber optics monitoring system was offered again as an option. Chevrolet made the Caprice Coupe's formal roofline available in the Impala series. The Impala Custom Coupe became the best-selling model in the line. The L72 [...] Turbo-Jet V8 returned to the option list after a one-year hiatus. A new [...] Turbo Fire V8 rated at [...] replaced the [...] small block as the standard engine. Inside, the instrument panel was revised with a return to the horizontal sweep speedometer and a revised <b>three-spoke</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> An optional instrument cluster had a narrow speedometer within its opening and flanking it with engine-turned instruments in the place of warning lights. The fuel gauge, placed next to the speedometer within its own pod in the base models, was moved to its new place next to the speedometer. A tachometer took the place of the fuel gauge in the large opening left by the fuel gauge.|$|E
