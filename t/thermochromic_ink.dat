Printed color-swatches and exercises were used as the central part of the approach. Through the approach it was described what printed color-swatches were and how to use them effectively to make color transitions understandable. The approach has been applied in several workshops at both Bachelor and Master level. The samples made by the students in the exercises clearly revealed that the approach created opportunities for students to craft an understanding of using leuco dye <b>thermochromic</b> <b>inks</b> through experimentation and individual exploration.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an exploration of}} the principles of applying leuco dye-based inks to textile design practice. The main motivation has been to explore the design properties and potentials of leuco dye-based <b>thermochromic</b> <b>inks</b> when printed on textiles in order to obtain an understanding and facilitate the design of dynamic surface patterns. The significance of this is related {{to the development of a}} methodology to assist designers in seeing possibilities, making informed decisions, and predicting colour transitions at different temperatures when designing a dynamic surface pattern. The research was conducted by undertaking a series of design experiments using leuco dye-based <b>thermochromic</b> <b>inks,</b> which resulted in various working methods and two pedagogical tools. This process offered the insight and depth of understanding required to design dynamic surface patterns, in that it highlighted the different colour-changing properties of leuco dye-based <b>thermochromic</b> <b>inks,</b> which have the potential to create a more complex and dynamic range of patterns on textiles than those that exist today. There is much to explore beyond the current design possibilities offered by <b>thermochromic</b> <b>inks,</b> and it is hoped that designers and researchers can apply the knowledge that has been obtained during the work of this thesis to their practical explorations so as to move towards new ways of thinking and designing, and further innovation in textile design...|$|R

40|$|Colour {{theories}} {{have been established}} {{in order to allow}} artists and designers to understand the relationship between colours, and to determine how a chosen colour will react or interact with another. Smart colours - such as leuco dye-based <b>thermochromic</b> <b>inks</b> - have entered into the textile and fashion design world, bringing with them new challenges. This paper stresses the fact that, in order to demonstrate and describe the behaviour of these inks at different temperatures when printed on textiles, a new colour system is required. Four design experiments using <b>thermochromic</b> <b>inks</b> are described and these, along with the discussion presented, highlight the need to develop a thermochromic colour system which can not only visualise and describe the behaviour of these inks in relation to other static pigments and temperatures, but also assist textile designers in making informed decisions during the design process. ...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{interactions}} between different solvents (benzene, acetone, cyclohexanone, various alcohols and water) and <b>thermochromic</b> printing <b>ink</b> were investigated. <b>Thermochromic</b> printing <b>ink</b> was printed on metal surface. Components of <b>thermochromic</b> printing <b>inks</b> are polymeric microcapsules and classic yellow offset printing ink. Below its activation temperature, dye and developer within the microcapsules form a blue coloured complex. Therefore, thermochromic print is green. By heating above the activation temperature, blue colour of the complex turns into the leuco dye colourless state and the green colour of the prints turns into the yellow colour of the classic offset pigment. The results of the interaction with various solvents show that the thermochromic print is stable in all tested solvents except in ethanol, acetone and cyclohexanone. In ethanol, the green colour of the print becomes yellow. SEM analysis shows that microcapsules are dissolved. In acetone and cyclohexanone, the green colour of the print turns into blue, and the microcapsules become significantly more visible. Thus, the yellow pigment interacts with examined ketones. Based on the obtained interactions {{it can be concluded}} that the microcapsules have more polar nature than the classical pigment particles.

40|$|The {{ability to}} print {{high-resolution}} thermochromic indicia, combining conventional inks with sophisticated printing technologies to either camouflage latent messages {{or create a}} warning message when copied, is new. (1) For Authentication: Offset thermochromic inks can trap a message that is printed in conventional ink. The conventional ink must match the <b>thermochromic</b> <b>ink</b> in density and color hue in order to perfectly hide at typical office room temperature. This technique {{is very difficult to}} manufacture. Even ifa fraudster was to obtain the protected ink, the technology is still extremely difficult to replicate. (2) For Copy Protection: Irregular pattern graphics printed in <b>thermochromic</b> <b>ink</b> over a linear Copy/Void message, or dot pattern Copy/Void message, allows for superior protection against replication. The thermochromic pantograph camouflages the Copy/Void message. But, because thermocbromic inks are both temperature sensitive and low in color pigment (pastel), the Copy/Void message prints through the ink onto the copy. This technology allows for an increase in disparity between the message and the background screen; maximizing protection effectiveness.

40|$|Thermochromic {{printing}} inks {{change their}} colour regarding {{the change in}} temperature and {{they are one of}} the major groups of colour-changing inks. One of the most frequently used thermochromic material in printing inks are leuco dyes. The colour of thermochromic prints is dynamic, it is not just temperature-dependent, but it also depends on thermal history. The effect is described by colour hysteresis. This paper aims at discussing general aspects of thermochromic inks, dynamic colorimetric properties of leuco dye-based thermochromic inks, their stability and principle of variable-temperature colour measurement. Thermochromic material is protected in round-shaped capsules. They are much larger than pigments in conventional inks. The polymer envelopes of pigment capsules are more stable against oxidation than the binder. If these envelopes are damaged, the dynamic colour is irreversibly lost. Our aim is to analyse the colorimetric properties of several reversible screen-printed UV-curing leuco dye thermochromic inks with different activation temperatures printed on paper.
