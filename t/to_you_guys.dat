5000|$|On 20 September 2011, two trucks {{containing}} 35 {{dead bodies}} were found at an underpass near a shopping mall in Boca del Río, Veracruz.

Zetas in the state of Veracruz and politicians helping them: This is going to happen to you, or we can shoot you as we did <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> before too. People of Veracruz, do not allow yourselves to be extorted; do not pay for protection; if you do is because you want to. This is the only thing these people (Los Zetas) can do.
