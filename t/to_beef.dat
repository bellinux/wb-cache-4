5|$|Progeny of {{two parents}} of {{different}} breeds are termed F1 hybrids, F1 crosses or first crosses. F1 hybrids generally have an extremely uniform phenotype {{and benefit from}} hybrid vigour. These advantages are observed in the breeding {{of a wide variety}} of animals and plants, and arise because progeny inherit one of each paired gene from each parent. When both parents are homozygous for different variants of genes (known as alleles), which is likely to be the case when a breed has been developed and selected over several generations, progeny will inherit both gene variants present in the parents. The F1 hybrid progeny will then be heterozygous for each gene variant, which in turn increases the likelihood that the genes will code for an optimal protein or enzyme. This is the genetic basis of hybrid vigour. While many gene variants have effects that are of little consequence <b>to</b> <b>beef</b> production, a few, such as the myostatin variants found in different cattle breeds, have a major effect.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into nine {{chapters}} with seven appendices. The first chapter details the pig and its use in antiquity before summarizing the nutrient components of pork in comparison <b>to</b> <b>beef.</b> The second chapter opens with the defining characteristics of a good bacon pig. The six principal breeds of the United Kingdom {{at the time were}} the Large White Yorkshire, the Middle White, the Tamworth, the Berkshire, the Lincolnshire Curly-Coated and the Large Black. The Large White Yorkshire breed is traced to Robert Bakewell and highlights the importance of the breed for its quick maturity, rapid fattening and providing a long side. Though also credited for the breeding of the Small White pig, Bakewell was secretive in his work and evidence of his pig breeding (as a whole) cannot be confirmed. Nicholls describes the other breeds and provides information on the number of pigs, the state of the industry and the classification of pigs for the market.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to analyze factors influencing farmers decision <b>to</b> increase <b>beef</b> cattle business scale through improved technology. The research was conducted by using a survey method. Five districts were purposively selected in three base areas and two non-base areas of beef cattle in Central Java Province, Indonesia. Twenty beef cattle groups were selected based on the largest cattle population managed and their performance, while 196 respondents were randomly selected. Farmers decision <b>to</b> increase <b>beef</b> cattle business scale was determined using a probit model. Result of the research indicated that the number of family labor and expectation to increase income had a significantly positive influence on the farmers’ decision <b>to</b> increase <b>beef</b> cattle business scale. It meant that if the total number of family labor increased, so did the farmers’ decision <b>to</b> increase the <b>beef</b> cattle business scale. Also, if the expectation to revenue increased, so did the farmers’ decision <b>to</b> increase the <b>beef</b> cattle business scale. On the contrary, education level and business risk had negative significant influence on the farmers decision <b>to</b> increase the <b>beef</b> cattle business scale with the significance levels of 1. 1 and 0. 84, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Virginia beef {{producers}} have been overwhelmed with increasing costs and decreasing profits {{as well as}} facing challenges such as development pressures, drought, increasing competition for grazing land. Together these have reduced opportunities for expansion and often increased incentives for farmers to sell land for non-agriculture use. Nevertheless, opportunities exist for the Virginia beef market. Consumer demand is changing and consumers are seeking food from alternative production systems based on attributes related to human health, environment, animal welfare, and other social concerns. Consumers are also interested in increasing their consumption of locally produced foods. Specialty beef such as natural, organic, and pasture-fed addresses the changing consumer demand and provides alternatives <b>to</b> commodity <b>beef</b> production. This thesis analyzes the potential for and the constraints <b>to</b> specialty <b>beef</b> producers in Virginia <b>to</b> sell their <b>beef</b> through alternative market outlets such as large retail outlets, specialty stores, restaurants, or direct to consumers.
