The 11 Pretreatment Program projects for FY 1995 are (1) Cesium Extraction Testing, (2) Comprehensive Supernate Treatment, (3) Hot Cell Studies, (4) Cesium Removal Demonstration, (5) Out-of-Tank Evaporator Demonstration, (6) Crossflow Filtration, (7) Technical Interchange with CEA, (8) TRUEX Applications, (9) NAC/NAG Process Studies (conducted at Oak Ridge National Laboratory), (10) NAC/NAG Process and Waste Form Studies (conducted at Florida International University), and (11) Program Management. Section 2 of this PMP contains a separate subsection for each FY 1995 project.

This would replicate the sediment/substrate rich habitat Apistogramma panduro is found in greatest abundance. This addition would stabilize pH and inoculate microbial production within the sediment which can provide as an additional/natural food source. Water flow and filtration should be minimal avoiding water replacement of the peat. Primarily, shaded lighting or dim lighting is most preferred, along with non-toxic aquatic plants that would provide shade or floating vegetation that would allow for further diffusion of light through the tank.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{maritime}} accidents {{have been}} caused by corrosion, and this has led to stringent regulations concerning protective coatings for ballast tanks. The Coating Performance Standard for Ballast Tank Coatings (PSPC), became effective in 2008. It specifies how protective coatings should be applied during vessel construction with the intention of giving a coating a 15-year service life. Additional regulations, such as those established by The International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships Ballast Water & Sediments (SBWS) sought to avoid introducing invasive species throughout the world through ship's ballast tanks. [...] The methods used to avoid having these invasive species surviving in ballast tanks however greatly increased the rate of corrosion. Therefore ongoing research attempts to find water treatment systems that kill invasive species, while not having a destructive effect on the ballast tank coatings. As double-hulled tankers were introduced it meant that there was more ballast <b>tank</b> <b>area</b> had to be coated and therefore a greater capital investment for ship owners. With the onset of the OPA 90 and later the amendments to MARPOL annex 1, single hull tankers (without alternative method) have basically phased out.|$|E
