5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> the {{original}} Greek authorities are Duris of Samos, Xenocrates of Sicyon, and Antigonus of Carystus. The anecdotic element has been ascribed to Duris (XXXIV:61); the notices of the successive developments {{of art and}} the list of workers in bronze and painters to Xenocrates; and a large amount of miscellaneous information to Antigonus. Both Xenocrates and Antigonus are named in connection with Parrhasius (XXXV:68), while Antigonus is named in the indexes of XXXIII–XXXIV as a writer on the art of embossing metal, or working it in ornamental relief or intaglio.|$|E

5|$|Reflecting Friedrich's {{patriotism and}} resentment during the 1813 French {{occupation}} of the dominion of Pomerania, motifs from German folklore became increasingly prominent in his work. An anti-French German nationalist, Friedrich used motifs from his native landscape to celebrate Germanic culture, customs and mythology. He {{was impressed by the}} anti-Napoleonic poetry of Ernst Moritz Arndt and Theodor Körner, and the patriotic literature of Adam Müller and Heinrich von Kleist. Moved by the deaths of three friends killed in battle against France, as well as by Kleist's 1808 drama Die Hermannsschlacht, Friedrich undertook a number of paintings in which he intended to convey political symbols solely by means of the landscape—a first in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>art.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stoddart {{was born}} in Edinburgh and raised in Renfrewshire, where he {{developed}} an early interest {{in the arts and}} music, and later trained in fine art at the Glasgow School of Art (1976–1980) and read <b>the</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> <b>Art</b> at the University of Glasgow. During this time he became increasingly critical of contemporary trends in art, such as pop art, and concentrated on creating figurine pieces in clay. Stoddart associates the lack of form in modern art with social decay; in contrast, his works include many classical allusions.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{looks at}} the {{problems}} facing the art teachers and resulted, in the author’s opinion, from separation of the content and functional side of the subject. The other problem {{is the lack of}} insight regarding social behavior, forms of consciousness and perception (including the spatial and temporal ones) underlying all sorts and forms <b>of</b> <b>art.</b> The paper demonstrates the interrelations between <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> and education <b>history</b> considered in terms of development and fixation of various forms of social consciousness. The audiovisual syncretism is regarded as the nature of perception and world reflection at specific historical stages of human knowledge and creativity development. Both <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> and education include the content and procedure related aspects. <b>The</b> whole <b>history</b> <b>of</b> pedagogy involves <b>the</b> procedure improvements (methods, means, forms, etc.) along the way «from integration to differentiation, and backwards»; and on the other side, it incorporates the invariable educational content. Likewise, throughout <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>arts</b> we can trace the procedural aspect developments and the existence of the “eternal” content related to personality upbringing. </p...|$|R

25|$|Winckelmann {{was read}} avidly by Johann Wolfgang Goethe and Friedrich Schiller, {{both of whom}} began to write on <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>art,</b> and {{his account of the}} Laocoon occasioned a {{response}} by Lessing. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment in 1790, and was furthered by Hegel's Lectures on Aesthetics. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for Karl Schnaase's work. Schnaase's Niederländische Briefe established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his Geschichte der bildenden Künste, one of the first historical surveys of <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by Franz Theodor Kugler.|$|E

40|$|A {{defining}} {{shift in}} Australian art historiography occurred with the publishing of Bernard Smith’s 1980 Boyer Lecture series, The Spectre of Truganini. Seeing {{the exclusion of}} an Aboriginal presence in Australian art through the ideas <b>of</b> Freud, <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Australian <b>art,</b> Smith proposed, was a <b>history</b> <b>of</b> repression. After Smith, Ian McLean has developed the most detailed account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Australian <b>art</b> according to this methodology. This essay examines {{the work of the}} modern Australian artist Fred Williams in relation to both Smith and McLean’s understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Australian <b>art</b> but to expand on their work I argue that, rather than Freud alone, it is Lacan’s refiguring of Freud that offers us the most insight into Williams’s work. Further, insofar as I argue that <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Australian <b>art</b> is <b>the</b> very subject matter of Williams’s work, his work stands in for a wider project, <b>the</b> understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Australian <b>art</b> according to Lacan’s proposal of a foundational split between the eye and the gaze...|$|R

25|$|An unsuspecting {{turn for}} <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>art</b> {{criticism}} came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo {{as one of}} the first psychology based analyses on a work of art. Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s Lives. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.|$|E
