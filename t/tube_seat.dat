The combined materials are usually carbon fiber and a metal, either steel, aluminum, or titanium. One implementation of this approach includes a metal down tube and chain stays with carbon top <b>tube,</b> <b>seat</b> tube, and seat stays. Another is a metal main triangle and chain stays with just carbon seat stays.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAcceleration {{and strain}} {{responses}} of a BMX bicycle in common cycling situations {{and in a}} race simulation are investigated. A comprehensive set of data is acquired by a specifically developed measurement and analysis system. The data-acquisition and signal conditioning device is run by customised application software enabling a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz for simultaneous acquisition of 28 measurement channels; 24 channels for strain and 4 channels for acceleration. Comprehensive results of strains and accelerations are presented, with strains being measured on fork, handlebar, top tube, down <b>tube,</b> <b>seat</b> stays and chain stays and accelerations being obtained at both dropouts, the stem and the seat clamp. The data provides quantitative results on strain levels throughout the frame, and in local regions where failure is known to occur. Accelerations from - 25 g to 43 g and magnitudes of strain of up to 2750 μe are obtained. An estimate of maximum stress of 190 MPa generated within the frame is calculated. Shear strains which are up to 84 % higher than were obtained in static tests are generated in race simulations. The paper provides significant insight into {{the complexity of the}} dynamic loads a BMX bicycle – rider system is subjected to, providing the basis for future optimisations of BMX bicycle frames...|$|E
25|$|The diamond frame {{consists}} of two triangles, a main triangle and a paired rear triangle. The main triangle {{consists of}} the head tube, top tube, down <b>tube</b> and <b>seat</b> <b>tube.</b> The rear triangle consists of the <b>seat</b> <b>tube,</b> and paired chain stays and seat stays.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the diamond}} frame, the main [...] "triangle" [...] is not {{actually}} a triangle because {{it consists of}} four tubes: the head tube, top tube, down <b>tube</b> and <b>seat</b> <b>tube.</b> The rear triangle consists of the <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> joined by paired chain stays and seat stays.|$|R
50|$|Only {{the very}} {{earliest}} examples had both a hinged <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> and handlebar stem. Within {{a year or}} two of introduction the hinged <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> was replaced by a conventional <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> with a long seat post that could be slid down or removed altogether. The lower end of the <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> was open, and {{to the rear of the}} bottom bracket, to allow the seat post to slide all the way down.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the standard diamond frame bicycles, Motobécane produced mixte frame versions; the mixte frame Grand Touring had twin lateral stays {{in place of a}} top tube, extending from the head <b>tube</b> to the <b>seat</b> <b>tube,</b> while the Super Touring and Grand Jubilé had a single top tube sloping down towards the <b>seat</b> <b>tube,</b> but diverging into twin lateral stays just before the <b>seat</b> <b>tube.</b> Later mixte Grand Touring models also used this design. Motobécane also produced a tandem bicycle.|$|R

25|$|The great {{majority}} of modern bicycles have a frame with upright seating that looks much like the first chain-driven bike. These upright bicycles almost always feature the diamond frame, a truss consisting of two triangles: the front triangle and the rear triangle. The front triangle consists of the head tube, top tube, down <b>tube,</b> and <b>seat</b> <b>tube.</b> The head tube contains the headset, the set of bearings that allows the fork to turn smoothly for steering and balance. The top tube connects the head <b>tube</b> to the <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> at the top, and the down tube connects the head tube to the bottom bracket. The rear triangle consists of the <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run parallel to the chain, connecting the bottom bracket to the rear dropout, where the axle for the rear wheel is held. The seat stays connect {{the top of the}} <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> (at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear fork ends.|$|R
5000|$|E-type : This type front derailleurs do not clamp {{around the}} frame's <b>seat</b> <b>tube,</b> but instead are {{attached}} to the frame by a plate mounted under the drive side bottom bracket cup and a screw threaded into a boss on the <b>seat</b> <b>tube.</b> These derailleurs are usually found on mountain bikes with rear suspension components that do not allow space for a normal derailleur's clamp to go around the <b>seat</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{critical}} angles in bicycle geometry are {{the head}} angle (the {{angle of the}} head <b>tube),</b> and the <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> angle (the angle of the <b>seat</b> <b>tube).</b> These angles are measured from the horizontal, and drastically affect the rider position and performance characteristics of the bicycle. Mountain bike geometry will often feature a <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> angle around 73 degrees, with a head tube angle of anywhere from 60-73 degrees. The intended application of the bike affects its geometry very heavily. In general, steeper angles (closer to 90 degrees from the horizontal) are more efficient for pedaling up hills and make for sharper handling. Slacker angles (leaning farther from the vertical) are preferred for high speeds and downhill stability.|$|R
5000|$|Adjustable seat tower, patent pending. Found on the KHS LT3 frame, this <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> Tower can {{be rotated}} via a cam {{to change the}} {{effective}} <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> angle of the frame by four degrees. Ideal for downhill riders competing or riding in carried terrain.|$|R
50|$|A variant on the mixte uses a single, full sized {{top tube}} {{running from the}} upper head <b>tube</b> to the <b>seat</b> <b>tube,</b> but retains the middle set of stays. The FNCRM (Fédération Nationale du Commerce et de la Réparation du Cycle et du Motocycle) calls this style a sport.|$|R
5000|$|GT {{is noted}} for their [...] "triple triangle" [...] hard-tail frame design [...] - [...] where seat stays are {{parallel}} to the downtube and attached to the top tube forward of the <b>seat</b> <b>tube,</b> rather than directly at the <b>seat</b> <b>tube.</b> The company often uses a frame design where the bike's top tube extends rearward past the <b>seat</b> <b>tube,</b> claimed to reduce the vibration transferred to the seat from the rear wheel. Later versions would have [...] "GT" [...] stamped {{on the end of}} the extended top tube.|$|R
25|$|In a {{cantilever}} {{bicycle frame}} the seat stays continue past the seat post and curve downwards {{to meet with}} the down tube. Cantilever frames are popular on the cruiser bicycle, the lowrider bicycle, and the wheelie bike. In many cantilever frames the only straight <b>tubes</b> are the <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> and the head tube.|$|R

50|$|As {{alternatives}} to the integrated seatpost mentioned above, some seatposts merely have an aerodynamic shape that either matches {{the shape of the}} aero <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> or is only not round above a certain point. In the case of aero <b>seat</b> <b>tubes,</b> {{there are a variety of}} clamping mechanisms for such seatposts that include pinch bolts and wedges.|$|R
50|$|The {{size of the}} {{seatpost}} {{is dependent}} upon the internal dimensions of the <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> of the bicycle frame. They come in various diameters, lengths and offsets. Offset is {{the distance between the}} centerline of the seatpost tube, and the centerline of the clamp area. Shims are often available to adapt a too-small seatpost to a too-large <b>seat</b> <b>tube.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>seat</b> <b>tube</b> {{contains}} the seatpost of the bike, which {{connects to the}} saddle. The saddle height is adjustable by changing how far the seatpost is inserted into the <b>seat</b> <b>tube.</b> On some bikes, this is achieved using a quick release lever. The seatpost must be inserted at least a certain length; this is marked with a minimum insertion mark.|$|R

5000|$|The {{frame of}} a road bicycle must, {{according}} to the UCI regulations, be constructed using a [...] "main triangle" [...] with three straight tubular shapes—the top tube, down <b>tube,</b> and <b>seat</b> <b>tube.</b> These three tubes, {{and other parts of}} the frame, need not be cylindrical, however, and many racing bicycles feature frames that use alternative shapes. Traditionally, the top tube of a racing bicycle is close to parallel with the ground when the bicycle is in its normal upright position.
