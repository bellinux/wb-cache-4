25|$|One of {{his star}} {{students}} was Rabbi Shlomo Wahrman, a tremendous Torah scholar {{who came from}} Leipzig for fifteen years {{and went on to}} becoming principal and Rosh Yeshiva of the Hebrew Academy of Nassau County. Rabbi Wahrman attributes his success to Rabbi Silver’s insistence and encouragement to hone his writing skills and record his copious chidushei Torah. Rabbi Wahrman writes in the short biography he published on Rabbi Silver:I remember at times he screamed at me for lack of understanding-however, even then I sensed his great love and concern for me and not <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> hatred. Rabbi Silver was a man whose very essence was giving to others-his ahavas yisroel (love for his fellow Jew) knew no bounds…he saw every Jew as an extension of himself.|$|E
25|$|At {{the peak}} of the terror, <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> counter-revolutionary {{thoughts}} or activities (or, {{as in the case of}} Jacques Hébert, revolutionary zeal exceeding that of those in power) could place one under suspicion, and trials did not always proceed according to contemporary standards of due process. Sometimes people died for their political opinions or actions, but many for little reason beyond mere suspicion, or because some others had a stake in getting rid of them. Most of the victims received an unceremonious trip to the guillotine in an open wooden cart (the tumbrel). In the rebellious provinces, the government representatives had unlimited authority and some engaged in extreme repressions and abuses. For example, Jean-Baptiste Carrier became notorious for the Noyades ("drownings") he organised in Nantes; his conduct was judged unacceptable even by the Jacobin government and he was recalled.|$|E
25|$|Ikeda {{graduated}} from the literature department of Waseda University in 1974, but became involved in filmmaking while still a student. According to Ikeda, his entry into the film industry was accidental, {{the result of a}} drunken barroom bet. His first job was at a small independent production company, Ishihara Productions, but he later moved to the major studio Nikkatsu, which at the time produced only films of the Roman porno genre, big budget versions of the pink film. At both companies, he began working as an Assistant Director, whose duties could include anything from cleaning floors to shaving actresses {{at a time when it}} was illegal to show even <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> pubic hair in Japanese media. Ikeda continued as an Assistant Director at Nikkatsu throughout the 1970s in such films as Flower and Snake (1974), Wife to be Sacrificed (1974) and Noble Lady: Bound Vase (1977), all directed by Masaru Konuma.|$|E

Highly recommended". In JazzTimes, Aaron Steinberg observed [...] "The two players stroll through winsome ballads, spirited dances and dark, carnivalesque themes while claiming liberties and creative detours that hardly jeopardize the balance of these modestly scaled pieces. They jump {{in and out of}} structured passages with grace, inject the music with tartness and just as convincingly (and with only <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> tongue-in-cheek) navigate <b>the</b> sweetest of melodies".|$|R
5000|$|For {{its first}} ten years, G.I. Joe was a generic soldier/adventurer with only <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> a team concept existing. In 1975, after a failed bid to {{purchase}} the toy rights to the Six Million Dollar Man, Hasbro issued a bionic warrior figure: Mike Power, Atomic Man. One million units were sold. Also added to the Adventure Team was a superhero, Bullet Man. This character had recurring enemies, The Intruders - Strongmen from Another World. Comics included with figures at the time featured [...] "Eagle Eye" [...] Joe, Atomic Man, and Bullet Man operating together; the Adventure Team was finally an actual team. The original 12 in G.I. Joe line ended in America in 1976. At this time, Hasbro released a line of inexpensive, rotationally molded mannequins in the G.I. Joe style called The Defenders.|$|R
500|$|... "Hypnotico" [...] {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Several journalists noted {{the similarities between}} the song and other Gaga works, with Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly stating that it sounded like [...] "a watered down version of 'Poker Face'" [...] and Scott Shetler of PopCrush elaborating that [...] "like many of [...] Gaga's songs", it is [...] "likely to stick in your head long after the song has ended". Allison Stewart from The Washington Post further expanded on this view, stating that [...] "without <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> noblesse oblige" [...] to Gaga, [...] "Hypnotico" [...] is a synthy, [...] "burbly slip" [...] of a song. Eliot Glazer of MTV Buzzworthy stated that the song seems to continue right where Lopez's 1999 hit single [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] left off, [...] "making us want to put on our short shorts and dance". In addition, he concluded that [...] "The thump that rides the song's undercurrent of ethereal echoes and a group chant of the chorus is a pretty solid reminder that this is most definitely a Gaga jam, which quickly gained J. Lo's approval". Amos Barshad of Vulture showcased his displeasure with the song, elaborating that although [...] "you can sort of tell" [...] that Gaga wrote the song, that was not an indication that it would become an instant hit, casting it as [...] "Bland and half-baked", and concluding that [...] "it was certainly farmed out for a reason".|$|E

Under orders from Mayor Edson, Walling closed {{the fight and}} had Thorne and Williams arrest both men. On January 19, 1885, Thorne was again involved in controversy when he was assigned as the police supervisor in a boxing match between John L. Sullivan and Paddy Ryan at Madison Square Garden. He had been ordered by New York Mayor William R.

2500|$|Later in January 2008, Clinton {{backed out}} of a cover photo shoot with Vogue over {{concerns}} by the Clinton camp that she would appear [...] "too feminine," [...] which prompted the magazine's editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, to write, [...] "Imagine my amazement, then, when I learned that Hillary Clinton, our only female presidential hopeful, had decided {{to steer clear of}} our pages at this point in her campaign for fear of looking too feminine. The notion that a contemporary woman must look mannish in order to be taken seriously as a seeker of power is frankly dismaying. How has our culture come to this? How is it that The Washington Post recoils from <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> cleavage on a senator? This is America, not Saudi Arabia. It's also 2008: Margaret Thatcher may have looked terrific in a blue power suit, but that was 20 years ago. I do think Americans have moved on from the power-suit mentality, which served as a bridge for a generation of women to reach boardrooms filled with men. Political campaigns that do not recognize this are making a serious misjudgment." ...|$|E

He claimed to have toured all the major towns of the Union and introduced the pig to President John Adams, to [...] "universal applause". Pinchbeck later explained his methods of training the pig in a pamphlet. He denied that any form of torture was involved, insisting {{that it was better}} to [...] "coax" [...] the pig to follow instructions. The animal would soon learn to respond to <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> movement from <b>the</b> trainer. He stated that credulous spectators accused him of using witchcraft, one stating that [...] "his performances were the effects of the Black Art; that the Pig ought to be burnt, and the Man banished, as he had no doubt but...trainer familiarly corresponded with the devil." [...] Others suggested that the pig was evidence of reincarnation: [...] "the spirit of the grunting philosopher might once have animated a man." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{loyalty of}} the Varangians became a trope of Byzantine writers. Writing {{about her father}} Alexius's seizing of the Imperial throne in 1081, Anna Komnene notes that he was advised not to attack the Varangians who still guarded the Emperor Nikephoros for the Varangians [...] "regard loyalty to the {{emperors}} {{and the protection of}} their persons as a family tradition, a kind of sacred trust". This allegiance, she noted, [...] "they preserve inviolate, and will never brook <b>the</b> <b>slighted</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> betrayal". Unlike <b>the</b> native Byzantine guards so mistrusted by Basil II, the Varangian guards' loyalties lay with the position of Emperor, not the man that sat on the throne. This was made clear in 969 when the guards failed to avenge the death by assassination of Emperor Nikephoros II. A servant had managed to call for the guards while the Emperor was being attacked, but when they arrived he was dead. They immediately knelt before John Tzimiskes, Nikephoros' murderer and hailed him as Emperor. [...] "Alive they would have defended him to the last breath: dead {{there was no point in}} avenging him. They had a new master now." ...|$|R
5000|$|The soundtrack {{received}} positive {{reviews and}} all the songs well received. Charulatha Mani of The Hindu for the song [...] "Adhisaya Raagam" [...] wrote, [...] "Adisaya Ragam starts off beautifully in Mahati raga and in the stanza that begins with ‘Oru Puram Paarthaal’, suddenly shifts to Bhairavi. Once again Yesudas breathes life into these lines and the noteworthy phrase in this stanza is ‘Maru Puram Paarthaal Kaaviri’the twisty sangati connecting the dhaivata-nishada-shadja deserves special mention". For the song [...] "Ezhu Swarangalukkul", she wrote [...] "This ragamalika piece begins majestically in Pantuvarali and the highlight of this song is the akara traversal from lower Gandhara to the upper octave Gandhara seamlessly". For the song [...] "Kelviyin Nayagane", she wrote [...] "“Kelviyin Nayagane” [...]. is a moving situational song, and <b>the</b> <b>slight</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> pathos that this raga brings out is cleverly used {{to build up the}} dramatic quotient in the movie. The bright opening in the upper-octave Gandhara and the subsequent traversal to the Suddha Dhaivata are striking". G. Dhananjayan wrote, [...] "In line with its title, the film had some amazing songs which remains popular even today and are rare gems appreciated for its quality".|$|R
2500|$|He {{rejected}} the respondents' position that [...] "an employer's good-faith belief that its actions {{are necessary to}} comply with Title VII's disparate-impact provision {{should be enough to}} justify race-conscious conduct." [...] This position would ignore [...] "the original, foundational prohibition of Title VII," [...] which bars employers from taking adverse action [...] "because of... race." [...] §2000e–2(a)(1); and when Congress codified the disparate-impact provision in 1991, it made no exception to disparate-treatment liability for actions taken in a good-faith effort to comply with the new, disparate-impact provision in subsection (k). Respondents' policy would encourage race-based action at <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> disparate impact— e.g. causing employers to discard the results of lawful and beneficial promotional examinations even where there is little if any evidence of disparate-impact discrimination— which would amount to a de facto quota system, in which a [...] "focus on statistics... could put undue pressure on employers to adopt inappropriate prophylactic measures." [...] "That operational principle could not be justified, for Title VII is express in disclaiming any interpretation of its requirements as calling for outright racial balancing." [...] §2000e–2(j). The purpose of Title VII [...] "is to promote hiring on the basis of job qualifications, rather than {{on the basis of race}} or color." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1999, {{less than}} a month before her wedding, The Sun {{published}} a photo of a topless Sophie with her Capital Radio colleague Chris Tarrant, which was taken during a business trip to Spain in 1988. Buckingham Palace immediately issued a statement saying, [...] "This morning's story in The Sun is a gross invasion of privacy and cannot be regarded as in the public interest. It has caused considerable distress." [...] Prime Minister Tony Blair also condemned the publication of the photograph. The Palace made an official complaint to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC). According to Sophie's business partner the incident had left her [...] "distressed", and she was reportedly [...] "devastated" [...] and felt [...] "she was 'letting the side down’ before her wedding". Tarrant later said, [...] "There was never, ever <b>the</b> <b>slightest</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> romance between Sophie and myself, let alone these snidey insinuations." [...] Following its publication, the newspaper issued a statement and apologised to Rhys-Jones and the next issue came out with the headline [...] "Sorry, Sophie". It also said that it would again apologise to Sophie in a letter and donate all sale proceeds of the issue to her charities. The photo had been given to the tabloid by Kara Noble, a friend and colleague of Sophie, for £100,000. Noble later apologised in the following months saying, [...] "I just want to say sorry to everyone who was involved." [...] Both she and the newspaper faced criticism from the public, and Noble was fired from her job at Heart 106.2 FM. The couple later decided not to make a formal complaint.|$|E

5000|$|The 1999 {{excavations}} {{consisted of}} four trenches designed to gain {{as much information}} as possible about the east end of the Abbey Church. ...Two phases of construction were identified. The church, as built in 1110, was constructed of flint and chalk rubble bonded by a pale brown chalky mortar. ...The choir was defined by the arcade that separated the body of the church from the surrounding ambulatory. ...Pilgrims, visiting shrines and chapels located at the east end of the church, would have walked along the ambulatory alongside the choir. One such chapel, projecting from {{the south side of the}} church, consisted of a small rectangular room with an apsidal east end. Part of a second chapel, of similar plan, was identified to the north of the church.The original east end of the 1110 church consisted of a small chapel that had been rebuilt in the late 12th or early 13th century using a pale, honey coloured, fine-grained limestone bonded by a hard orange mortar.The stratigraphic sequence suggests that the original chapel was standing while the new structure was built. It was demolished on completion of the work, possibly to limit the interruption to services. The date of construction is uncertain, but it may be associated with the programme spurred on by the 'miraculous events' that occurred at the shrine of St. Barnabas in 1182.....Directly in front of the high altar was a group of deep intercutting pits that represent past attempts to find the tomb of Alfred the Great. At the dissolution of the Abbey in 1539, graves in front of the high altar are said to have produced small lead tablets bearing the names Alfred and Edward. No archaeological trace of this first recorded breaching has survived, but subsequent discoveries suggest that the graves were left intact. Within a year the church and cloisters were demolished and the site of the church was lost from the landscape. However, late 18th century maps show that the site was littered with mounds of rubble....A few years after the event, the site was visited by Captain Howard, a noted antiquarian, who was aware of the discoveries made by Henry VIII's Commissioners. He interviewed Mr Page, the Prison Warden, who told him that during works in the Governor's garden the site of the high altar was found, with three graves located before it.The coffin thought to be Alfred's was made of a single block of stone encased with lead. He was also told of its fate - the prisoners threw the bones about, broke up the coffin and sold the lead. Then the original grave pit was dug deeper to the level of the watertable, and the broken coffin reburied.The earliest pit in the area accords well with Page's description. It extended across the full width of the high altar area and had been dug down to <b>the</b> watertable.... <b>Slight</b> <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> earlier cuts were found that might represent the three royal tombs.|$|R
