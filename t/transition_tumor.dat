The roles of miRs in tumor pathogenesis have only recently become a focus of research. It is becoming increasingly clear that miRs are important regulators of apoptosis, proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in cancer cells during cancer genesis and progression, furthering our understanding of cancer. In the present review, we summarize and evaluate the recent advances in our understanding of the characteristics of miRs as well as their regulated functions in cancer stem cells (CSCs), the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the tumor microenvironment (TM), describing their roles in tumor pathogenesis and their possible use as new therapeutic targets and biomarkers.

40|$|Tumor budding is a {{histological}} phenomenon {{encountered in}} various cancers, whereby individual malignant cells and/or small clusters of malignant cells {{are seen in}} the tumor stroma. Postulated to be mirror epithelial-mesenchymal <b>transition,</b> <b>tumor</b> budding {{has been associated with}} poor cancer outcomes. However, the vast heterogeneity in its exact definition, methodology of assessment, and patient stratification need to be resolved before it can be routinely used as a standardized prognostic feature. Here, we discuss the heterogeneity in defining and assessing tumor budding, its clinical significance across multiple cancer types, and its prospective implementation in clinical practice. Next, we review the emerging evidence about partial, rather than complete, epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype at the tumor bud level, and its connection with tumor proliferation, quiescence, and stemness. Finally, based on recent literature, indicating a co-expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers in many tumor buds, we posit tumor budding to be a manifestation of this hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype displaying collective cell migration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Oligometastasis is {{a cancer}} disease state char-acterized by {{a limited number}} of metastatic tumors {{involving}} single or few organs and with biological prop-erties that make them potentially amenable to locoregional antitumor therapy. Current clinical data show that they are potentially curable with surgical resection or/and radio-therapy. Yet, mechanisms of progression from primary tumor to oligometastasis, rather than to polymetastases, is lacking in detail. In the current review we focus on the role of micro-RNAs in the regulation of metastases develop-ment and the role they may play in the differentiation of oligometastatic from polymetastatic progression. We also discuss the analyses of metastatic samples from oligo-and polymetastatic patients, which suggest that oligometastasis is a distinct biologic entity regulated in part by micro-RNAs. In addition, a review of the known functions of oligometastatic-specific micro-RNAs suggest that they regulate multiple steps in the metastatic cascade, including epithelial–mesenchymal <b>transition,</b> <b>tumor</b> invasion, in-travasation, distant vascular extravasation and proliferation in a distant organ. Understanding the role of micro-RNAs and their target genes in oligometastatic disease may allow for the development of targeted therapies to effectively conrol the spread of metastases...|$|E

CD 44 {{is found to be}} closely linked to the development of various solid tumors.

Correspondingly, blockade of CD 44 has been demonstrated to be capable of attenuating the malignant phenotype, slowing cancer progression, and reversing therapy resistance. Clinical analyses showed that high CD 44 expression is associated with poor survival of various cancer patients, indicating that CD 44 can be a potential prognostic marker.

40|$|ObjectiveMetastasis {{is thought}} to be governed {{partially}} by induction of epithelial–mesenchymal transition. Combination of proteasome and histone deacetylase inhibitors has shown significant promise, but no studies have investigated this in esophageal cancer. This study investigated effects of vorinostat (histone deacetylase inhibitor) and bortezomib (proteasome inhibitor) on esophageal cancer epithelial–mesenchymal transition. MethodsThree-dimensional tumor spheroids mimicking tumor architecture were created with esophageal squamous and adenocarcinoma cancer cells. Cells were treated with tumor necrosis factor α (to simulate proinflammatory tumor milieu) and transforming growth factor β (cytokine critical for induction of epithelial–mesenchymal <b>transition).</b> <b>Tumor</b> models were then treated with vorinostat, bortezomib, or both. Cytotoxic assays assessed cell death. Messenger RNA and protein expressions of metastasis suppressor genes were assessed. After treatment, Boyden chamber invasion assays were performed. ResultsCombined therapy resulted in 3. 7 -fold decrease in adenocarcinoma cell invasion (P = . 002) and 2. 8 -fold decrease in squamous cell invasion (P = . 003). Three-dimensional invasion assays demonstrated significant decrease in epithelial–mesenchymal transition after combined therapy. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses revealed robust rescue of E-cadherin transcription and protein expression after combined therapy. Importantly, inhibition of the E-cadherin gene resulted in abolition of the salutary benefits of combined therapy, highlighting the importance of this metastasis suppressor gene in the epithelial–mesenchymal transition process. ConclusionsCombined vorinostat and bortezomib therapy significantly decreased esophageal cancer epithelial–mesenchymal transition. This combined therapeutic effect on esophageal cancer epithelial–mesenchymal transition was associated with upregulation of E-cadherin protein expression...|$|E
40|$|Metastases are {{the major}} cause of cancer-related deaths, but the {{mechanisms}} of the metastatic process remain poorly understood. In recent years, the involvement of microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer has become apparent, and {{the objective of this}} study was to identify miRNAs associated with breast cancer progression. Global miRNA expression profiling was performed on 47 tumor samples from 14 patients with paired samples from primary breast tumors and corresponding lymph node and distant metastases using LNA-enhanced miRNA microarrays. The identified miRNA expression alterations were validated by real-time PCR, and tissue distribution of the miRNAs was visualized by in situ hybridization. The patients, in which the miRNA profile of the primary tumor and corresponding distant metastasis clustered in the unsupervised cluster analysis, showed significantly shorter intervals between the diagnosis of the primary tumor and distant metastasis (median 1. 6 years) compared to those that did not cluster (median 11. 3 years) (p< 0. 003). Fifteen miRNAs were identified that were significantly differentially expressed between primary tumors and corresponding distant metastases, including miR- 9, miR- 219 - 5 p and four of the five members of the miR- 200 family involved in epithelial-mesenchymal <b>transition.</b> <b>Tumor</b> expression of miR- 9 and miR- 200 b were confirmed using in situ hybridization, which also verified higher expression of these miRNAs in the distant metastases versus corresponding primary tumors.

In this study it was investigated if fibroblasts {{are the source}} of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays {{a crucial role in the}} progression of oral squamous cell carcinoma. In a novel in vitro system oral Fibs were cultured with SCC- 25 lingual squamous cell carcinoma cells for 7 days. Factors related with this interaction were investigated by quantitative PCR and western blot. In the co-culture, fibroblasts were converted to carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which in return initiated epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) of SCC- 25 cells. The induced CAFs produced increased levels of BDNF, which interacted with the increased-expressed neurothrophin receptor B (TrkB) on EMT-converted SCC- 25 cells. Possible regulatory factors of BDNF expression (tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin- 1 -β) were detected both in CAFs and EMT-tumor cells. In CAFs: IL- 1 β-, in SCC- 25 cells TNF-α-gene-expression was significantly increased in co-culture conditions.

Several gene transcription factors regulate EMT, including Snail 1, Snail 2, Zeb 1, Zeb 2, and Twist; ongoing studies continue to identify and elucidate other drivers. Specific micro ribonucleic acids (RNAs) have also been found to regulate EMT, including the microRNA- 200 (miR- 200) family, which targets Zeb 1 /Zeb 2. Cancer “stem cells” – with the ability to self-renew and to regenerate all the cell types within the tumor – have been found to express EMT markers, further implicating both cancer stem cells and EMT with metastasis. Microenvironmental cues, including transforming growth factor-β, can direct EMT tumor metastasis, such as by regulating miR- 200 expression. In human tumors, EMT markers and regulators may be expressed in a subset of tumor cells, such as in cells at the invasive front or tumor–microenvironment interface, though certain subtypes of cancer can show widespread mesenchymal-like features. In terms of therapeutic targeting of EMT in patients, potential areas of exploration could include targeting the cancer stem cell subpopulation, as well as microRNA-based therapeutics that reintroduce miR- 200. This review will examine evidence for a role of EMT in invasion and metastasis, with the focus being on studies in lung and breast cancers. We also carry out analyses of publicly-available gene expression profiling datasets in order to show how EMT-associated genes appear coordinately expressed across human tumor specimens.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} comparison of characteristics of the microvasculature in <b>transition</b> zone <b>tumor</b> (TZT) and benign nodular hyperplasia (BPH) with normal prostatic transition zone (NTZ), applying accurate and objective quantification based on digital image analysis. Results of this study may increase understanding of prostate dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI analysis. METHODS: Radical prostatectomy specimens of 28 patients containing TZT ranging from pT 2 -pT 4 were used. In 11 patients a concomitant peripheral zone tumor (PZT) was present. Microvessels were visualized by CD 31 immunohistochemistry. Specimens were scanned using a computer-controlled microscope with automatic recognition of microvessels. Pseudocolor maps were produced displaying microvessel density, perimeter, and area of an entire prostate transection. Mean, 75 th percentile (p 75) and coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated automatically in manually indicated areas of the tumor and corresponding contralateral normal tissue, and BPH. RESULTS: Large variability was seen in TZT microvascular parameters, indicating presence of patients having both hypo and hypervascularized tumors compared to NTZ. In contrast, areas of BPH showed a more consistent increase in vascular parameters, with decreased CV. Analysis of PZT confirmed results of our previous study, with mean and p 75 of all vascular parameters being significantly increased and a decrease in CV. No correlation was found for clinicopathological parameters and microvascular parameters. CONCLUSION: Microvasculature of <b>transition</b> zone <b>tumor</b> showed increased heterogeneity compared to BPH and peripheral zone tumors, possibly explaining the difficulty of TZT detection on DCE-MRI.

40|$|Epithelial-mesenchymal {{transition}} (EMT) {{and cancer}} stem-like cells (CSC) are becoming highly relevant targets in anticancer drug discovery. A {{large body of}} evidence suggests that epithelial-mesenchymal <b>transitioned</b> <b>tumor</b> cells (EMT tumor cells) and CSCs have similar functions. There is also an overlap regarding the stimuli that can induce the generation of EMT tumor cells and CSCs. Moreover, direct evidence has been brought that EMT can give rise to CSCs. It is unclear however, whether EMT tumor cells should be considered CSCs or {{if they have to}} undergo further changes. In this article we summarize available evidence suggesting that, indeed, additional programs must be engaged and we propose that macroautophagy (hereafter, autophagy) represents a key trait distinguishing CSCs from EMT tumor cells. Thus, CSCs have often been reported to be in an autophagic state and blockade of autophagy inhibits CSCs. On the other hand, there is ample evidence showing that EMT and autophagy are distinct events. CSCs, however, represent, by themselves, a heterogeneous population. Thus, CSCs have been distinguished in predominantly noncycling and cycling CSCs, the latter representing CSCs that self-renew and replenish the pool of differentiated tumor cells. We now suggest that the non-cycling CSC subpopulation is in an autophagic state. We propose also two models to explain the relationship between EMT tumor cells and these two major CSC subpopulations: a branching model in which EMT tumor cells can give rise to cycling or non-cycling CSCs, respectively, and a hierarchical model in which EMT tumor cells are first induced to become autophagic CSCs and, subsequently, cycling CSCs.

40|$|SummaryTumor hypoxia is {{associated}} with disease progression and treatment failure, but the hypoxia signaling mechanism is not fully understood. Here, we show that KLHL 20, a Cullin 3 (Cul 3) substrate adaptor induced by HIF- 1, coordinates with the actions of CDK 1 / 2 and Pin 1 to mediate hypoxia-induced PML proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, this PML destruction pathway participates in a feedback mechanism to maximize HIF- 1 α induction, thereby potentiating multiple tumor hypoxia responses, including metabolic reprogramming, epithelial-mesenchymal <b>transition,</b> migration, <b>tumor</b> growth, angiogenesis, and chemoresistance.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of heterogeneous tumor cell populations competing with healthy cells {{is an important}} topic in cancer research with deep implications in biomedicine. Multitude of theoretical and computational models have addressed this issue, especially focusing {{on the nature of}} the <b>transitions</b> governing <b>tumor</b> clearance as some relevant model parameters are tuned. In this contribution, we analyze a mathematical model of unstable tumor progression using the quasispecies framework. Our aim is to define a minimal model incorporating the {{dynamics of}} competition between healthy cells and a heterogeneous population of cancer cell phenotypes involving changes in replication-related genes (i. e., proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes), in genes responsible for genomic stability, and in house-keeping genes. Such mutations or loss of genes result into different phenotypes with increased proliferation rates and/or increased genomic instabilities. Despite bifurcations in the classical deterministic quasispecies model are typically given by smooth, continuous shifts (i. e., transcritical bifurcations), we here identify a novel type of bifurcation causing an abrupt <b>transition</b> to <b>tumor</b> extinction. Such a bifurcation, named as trans-heteroclinic, is characterized by the exchange of stability between two distant fixed points (that do not collide) involving tumor persistence and tumor clearance. The increase of mutation and/or the decrease of the replication rate of tumor cells involves this catastrophic shift of tumor cell populations. The transient times near bifurcation thresholds are also characterized, showing a power law dependence of exponent − 1 of the transients as mutation is changed near the bifurcation value. These results are discussed in the context of targeted cancer therapy as a possible therapeutic strategy to force a catastrophic shift by simultaneously delivering mutagenic and cytotoxic drugs inside tumor cells.

We found that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) displays only modest transcriptional regulatory activity in cells derived from the three non-tumor stages, whereas it is highly active in fibrosarcoma cells. Upon inoculation into mice, the aggressive fibromatosis cells progress to tumor cells that have high GR activity; thus, the increased transcriptional regulatory activity of GR correlates with the cellular <b>transition</b> to the <b>tumor</b> stage. The intracellular levels of GR, {{as well as its}} hormone-dependent nuclear translocation and specific DNA binding activities, are unaltered throughout the progression.

Moreover, comparisons of primary embryo fibroblasts and their transformed derivatives revealed a similar pattern [...] modest GR activity, unresponsive to overexpressed GR protein, in the normal cells was strongly increased in the transformed cells. Likewise, the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) displayed similar differential activity in the fibrosarcoma pathway. Thus, the oncogenic transformation of fibroblasts, and likely other cell types, is accompanied by a striking increase in the activities of transcriptional regulators such as GR and RAR.

Over 60 % of human ccRCCs (n= 157) have negative or weak NEMO protein expression by immunohistochemistry. Moderate/strong NEMO protein expression is more frequent in VHL wild-type ccRCCs. We show that NEMO stabilizes HIFα via direct interaction and independently of NF-κB signaling in vitro. NEMO prolongs tumor cell survival via regulation of apoptosis and activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal <b>transition,</b> facilitating <b>tumor</b> metastasis. Our findings suggest that NEMO-driven HIF activation is involved in progression of ccRCC. Therefore, NEMO may represent a clinically relevant link between NF-κB and the VHL/HIF pathways. Targeting NEMO with specific inhibitors in patients with metastatic ccRCC could be a novel treatment approach in patients with ccRCC expressing functional pVHL.

40|$|Antisense oligonucleotides (oligos) {{have been}} {{employed}} against in vivo and in vitro prostate cancer models. While most oligos target growth factors or their receptors, others are directed against inhibitors of apoptosis or mediators of androgen activity. In previous experiments, mono- and bispecific oligos directed against bcl- 2 suppressed both the targeted bcl- 2 protein (an inhibitor of apoptosis) and non-targeted caspase- 3 (a promoter of apoptosis), potentially negating {{the effect of}} therapeutic bcl- 2 inhibition. Subsequently we reported that AR and p 300 expression were significantly enhanced by these oligos. In a continuation of this study, we now report that the expression of another androgen receptor co-stimulatory protein, CREB binding protein (CREBBP), is not similarly increased. These data suggest that oligo treatment directed against bcl- 2 can be evaded through compensatory increases in AR and p 300 expression. Increased AR and p 300 expression may <b>transition</b> the <b>tumor</b> to a more dedifferentiated and aggressive phenotype. However, not all co-stimulating proteins (CREBBP) are involved, {{and this may be}} important when controlling unanticipated (compensatory) effects of gene therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{epithelial}} to mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays crucial {{roles in}} the formation of the body plan and also in the tumor invasion process. In addition, EMT also causes disruption of cell-cell adherence, loss of apico-basal polarity, matrix remodeling, increased motility and invasiveness in promoting tumor metastasis. The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in facilitating cancer metastasis and may induce the occurrence of EMT in tumor cells. A large number of inflammatory cells infiltrating the tumor site, as well as hypoxia existing in a large area of tumor, in addition many stem cells present in tumor microenvironment, such as cancer stem cells (CSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), all of these may be the inducers of EMT in tumor cells. The signaling pathways involved in EMT are various, including TGF-b, NF- B, Wnt, Notch, and others. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge about the role of the tumor microenvironment in EMT and the related signaling pathways as well as the interaction between them.

40|$|Abstract. E- and N-cadherin are calcium-dependent cell {{adhesion}} molecules that mediate cell–{{cell adhesion}} and also modulate cell migration and tumor invasiveness. The loss of E-cadherin–mediated adhesion {{has been shown}} {{to play an important role}} in the <b>transition</b> of epithelial <b>tumors</b> from a benign to an invasive state. However, recent evidence indicates that another member of the cadherin family, N-cadherin, is expressed in highly invasive tumor cell lines that lacked E-cadherin expression. These findings have raised the possibility that N-cadherin contributes to the invasive phenotype. To determine whether N-cadherin promotes invasion and metastasis, we transfected a weakly metastatic and E-cadherin–expressing breast cancer cell line, MCF- 7, with N-cadherin and analyzed the effects on cel...|$|R
