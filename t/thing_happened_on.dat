25|$|Howerd was {{a regular}} feature in the 1950s version of the comic Film Fun but when he began experimenting with {{different}} formats and contexts, including stage farces, Shakespearean comedy roles, and television sitcoms, he began {{to fall out of}} fashion. After suffering a nervous breakdown {{at the start of the}} 1960s, he began to recover his old popularity, initially with a season at Peter Cook's satirical Establishment Club in Soho in London.
