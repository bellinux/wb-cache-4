5|$|In early 1612, {{the year}} of the trials, every justice of the peace (JP) in Lancashire was ordered to compile a list of recusants in their area, i.e. those who refused to attend the English Church and to take communion, a {{criminal}} offence at that time. Roger Nowell of Read Hall, on the edge of Pendle Forest, was the JP for Pendle. It was against this background of seeking out religious nonconformists that, in March 1612, Nowell investigated a complaint made to him by the family of John Law, a pedlar, who claimed to have been injured by witchcraft. Many of those who subsequently became implicated as the investigation progressed did indeed consider themselves to be witches, in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> village healers who practised magic, probably in return for payment, but such men and women were common in 16th-century rural England, an accepted part of village life.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{elements}} that Winnicott considered could be lost in childhood was what he called <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> for him, a primary element, of which a sense of doing is only a derivative. The capacity for being the ability to feel genuinely alive inside, which Winnicott saw as essential {{to the maintenance of}} a true self was fostered in his view by the practice of childhood play.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} with bumblebees (Bombus) is rather different. They too are unpalatable, in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> difficult to eat: their body {{is covered with}} setae (like carpet pile) and is armoured; they are sometimes described as being 'non-food'. Mostler in 1935 carried out tests of their palatability: {{with the exception of}} specialist bee-eaters, adults of 19 species of birds ate only 2% of 646 bumblebees presented to them. After various trials, Mostler attributed their avoidance mainly to mechanical difficulties in handling: one young bird took 18 minutes to subdue, kill and eat a bumblebee.|$|E
25|$|He {{is a man}} magnificently at home in nature, a virtuoso of pre-Christian innocence, {{almost a}} Portuguese teacher of Zen. Reis is a stoic Horatian, a pagan believer in fate, a player with {{classical}} myths less original than Caeiro, but more representative of modern symbolism. De Campos emerges as a Whitmanesque futurist, a dreamer in drunkenness, the Dionysian singer of what is oceanic and windswept in Lisbon. None of this triad resembles the metaphysical solitude, <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> an occultist medium which characterise Pessoa's 'own' intimate verse.|$|E

Gender identity {{may or may not}} conform to a person's birth assigned sex. The personal characteristics that are associated with gender identity include self-image, physical and biological appearance, expression, behaviour and conduct, as they relate to gender. … Individuals whose birth-assigned sex does not conform to their gender identity include transsexuals, transgenderists, intersexed persons and cross-dressers. A person's gender {{identity is}} fundamentally different from and not determinative of their sexual orientation.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, Heidegger {{was elected}} to an {{extraordinary}} Professorship in Philosophy at the University of Marburg. His colleagues there included Rudolf Bultmann, Nicolai Hartmann, and Paul Natorp. Heidegger's students at Marburg included Hans-Georg Gadamer, Hannah Arendt, Karl Löwith, Gerhard Krüger, Leo Strauss, Jacob Klein, Gunther (Stern) Anders, and Hans Jonas. Following on from Aristotle, he began to develop in his lectures the main theme of his philosophy: the question of <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being.</b> He extended the concept of subject to the dimension of history and concrete existence, which he found prefigured in such Christian thinkers as Saint Paul, Augustine of Hippo, Luther, and Kierkegaard. He also read the works of Dilthey, Husserl, and Max Scheler.|$|E
25|$|It is {{in those}} two {{functions}} that the real life of the ego is manifested, but behind them is self-consciousness permanently present, which is always both subjective and objective — consciousness of ourselves and of the non-ego. This self-consciousness is the third special form or function of thought — which is also called feeling and immediate knowledge. In it we cognize our own inner life as affected by the non-ego. As the non-ego helps or hinders, enlarges or limits, our inner life, we feel pleasure or pain. Aesthetic, moral and religious feelings are respectively produced by the reception into consciousness of large ideas — nature, mankind and the world; those feelings are <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> one with these vast objects. Religious feeling therefore is the highest form of thought and of life; in it we are conscious of our unity with the world and God; it is thus the sense of absolute dependence.|$|E

500|$|By {{this time}} the general {{impeccable}} standards of the Ritz had fallen. Peregrine Worsthorne noted the change: [...] "Precisely {{that it was not}} all Ritzy, in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> conspicuously luxurious...the glitter had long since faded and shabbiness set in. The place was usually empty, kept alive by memories of former glories and a clientele who preferred nostalgia to comfort".|$|E
500|$|The key British {{alternative}} {{rock band}} to emerge during the 1980s was Manchester's The Smiths. Music journalist Simon Reynolds singled out The Smiths and their American contemporaries R.E.M. as [...] "the {{two most important}} alt-rock bands of the day", commenting that they [...] "were eighties bands only in <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> against the eighties". Reynolds noted that The Smiths' [...] "whole stance was predicated on their British audience being a lost generation, exiles in their own land". The Smiths' embrace of the guitar {{in an era of}} synthesizer-dominated music is viewed as signaling the end of the new wave era and the advent of alternative rock in the United Kingdom. Despite the band's limited chart success and short career, The Smiths exerted an influence over the British indie scene {{through the end of the}} decade, as various bands drew from singer Morrissey's English-centered lyrical topics and guitarist Johnny Marr's jangly guitar-playing style. The C86 cassette, a 1986 NME premium featuring Primal Scream, The Wedding Present and others, was a major influence on the development of indie pop and the British indie scene as a whole.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> déclassé, {{along with}} rocky {{experiences}} at school, made this {{a difficult time}} for Döblin. Although he had early been a good student, starting in his fourth year of Gymnasium his performance tended toward the mediocre. Furthermore, his oppositional tendencies against the stern conventionality of the partriarchal, militaristic Wilhelminian educational system, which stood in contrast to his artistic inclinations and his free thought, earned him {{the status of a}} rebel among his teachers. Despite his hatred for school, Döblin early became a passionate writer and reader, counting Spinoza, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche, as well as Heinrich von Kleist, Friedrich Hölderlin, and Fyodor Dostoyevsky among his most important early influences. He wrote his first novel, Jagende Rosse (Rushing Steeds), before completing school and dedicated it to the [...] "Manes of Hölderlin". He sent a copy to the prominent critic and philosopher Fritz Mauthner who returned it a few days later. However, wishing to hide his artistic inclinations from his mother, Döblin had sent the manuscript under a false name, and was not able to retrieve it at the post office; he thus had to rewrite it entirely.|$|E
