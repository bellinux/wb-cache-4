6000|$|This kingdom, {{created by}} the Vienna Congress as an {{acknowledgment}} to a nation of its former independent existence, included only the central provinces of the old Polish patrimony. A brother of the Emperor, the Grand Duke Constantine (Pavlovitch), its Viceroy and Commander-in-Chief, married morganatically to a Polish lady to whom he was fiercely attached, extended this affection to what he called [...] "My Poles" [...] in a capricious and savage manner. Sallow in complexion, with a Tartar physiognomy and fierce little eyes, he walked with his fists clenched, his body bent forward, darting suspicious glances from under an enormous cocked hat. His intelligence was limited and his sanity itself was doubtful. The hereditary taint expressed itself, in his case, not by mystic leanings as in his two brothers, Alexander and Nicholas (in their various ways, for one was mystically liberal and the other mystically autocratic), but by the fury of an uncontrollable temper which generally broke out in disgusting abuse on the parade ground. He was a passionate militarist and an amazing drill-master. He treated his Polish Army as a spoiled child treats a favourite toy, except {{that he did not}} take it to bed with him at night. It was not small enough for that. But he played with it all day and every day, delighting in the variety of pretty uniforms and in the fun of incessant drilling. This childish passion, not for war but for mere militarism, achieved a desirable result. The Polish Army, in its equipment, in its armament and in its battlefield efficiency, as then understood, became, {{by the end of the}} year 1830, a first-rate <b>tactical</b> <b>instrument.</b> Polish peasantry (not serfs) served in the ranks by enlistment, and the officers belonged mainly to the smaller nobility. Mr. Nicholas B., with his Napoleonic record, had no difficulty in obtaining a lieutenancy, but the promotion in the Polish Army was slow, because, being a separate organisation, it took no part in the wars of the Russian Empire against Persia or Turkey. Its first campaign, against Russia itself, was to be its last. In 1831, on the outbreak of the Revolution, Mr. Nicholas B. was the senior captain of his regiment. Some time before he had been made head of the remount establishment quartered outside the kingdom in our southern provinces, whence almost all the horses for the Polish cavalry were drawn. For the first time since he went away from home at the age of eighteen to begin his military life by the battle of Friedland, Mr. Nicholas B. breathed the air of the [...] "Border," [...] his native air. Unkind fate was lying in wait for him amongst the scenes of his youth. At the first news of the rising in Warsaw all the remount establishment, officers, vets., and the very troopers, were put promptly under arrest and hurried off in a body beyond the Dnieper to the nearest town in Russia proper. From there they were dispersed to the distant parts of the Empire. On this occasion poor Mr. Nicholas B. penetrated into Russia much farther than he ever did in the times of Napoleonic invasion, if much less willingly. Astrakhan was his destination. He remained there three years, allowed to live at large in the town but having to report himself every day at noon to the military commandant, who used to detain him frequently for a pipe and a chat. It is difficult to form a just idea of what a chat with Mr. Nicholas B. could have been like. There must have been much compressed rage under his taciturnity, for the commandant communicated to him the news from the theatre of war and this news was such as it could be, that is, very bad for the Poles. Mr. Nicholas B. received these communications with outward phlegm, but the Russian showed a warm sympathy for his prisoner. [...] "As a soldier myself I understand your feelings. You, of course, would like to be in the thick of it. By heavens! I am fond of you. If it were not for the terms of the military oath I would let you go on my own responsibility. What difference could it make to us, one more or less of you?" ...|$|R
40|$|The {{last few}} decades have shown a {{substantial}} increase in personal mobility. Urban traffic and transport volumes have been increasing for years. However, the share of public transport in this mobility growth did not change much and still remains rather limited. To ensure the accessibility and liveability of our cities for future generations, however, a substantial quality leap in public transport is necessary. This will facilitate a desired modal shift from car traffic towards public transport, which is safer, cleaner and produces less congestion. In this thesis, we demonstrate that several promising opportunities exist to improve service reliability (i. e. the certainty of service aspects compared to the schedule as perceived by the user), being {{one of the most important}} quality aspects of public transport. Literature shows that in urban public transport substantial attention is given to ways to improve service reliability at the operational level. It is not clear how and to what extent strategic and tactical design decisions in public transport systems might affect service reliability. Only traffic light priority and exclusive lanes are considered during the planning of urban public transport in order to improve the level of service reliability. We expect that more instruments at these planning levels enable high-quality services at the operational level, especially with regard to service reliability. In this thesis, we present several planning instruments that facilitate enhanced service reliability. In addition, we show forecasting tools we developed and we introduce a new indicator that expresses the impacts of service reliability more effectively than traditional indicators, namely the additional travel time per passenger. This way, the assessment of public transport benefits will be substantially improved, thereby enabling cost-effective quality improvements. We show the impacts of unreliable services on passengers, being average travel time extension, increased travel time variability and a lower probability of finding a seat in the vehicle. We demonstrate how actual vehicle trip time variability (i. e. service variability) affects service reliability and passenger travel time. In order to gain insights into the mechanisms between these two aspects, we performed research based on empirical data of the public transport system in The Hague. Furthermore, we conducted an international survey of service reliability. Several traditional quantifications of service reliability are presented, such as punctuality and regularity. We demonstrate the shortcomings of these traditional indicators, namely a lack of attention for passenger impacts. Traditional indicators focus too much on the supply side of public transport, which does not allow a proper analysis of passenger effects. To deal with the shortcomings of traditional indicators, we developed a new indicator, being the average additional travel time per passenger. This indicator translates the supply-side indicators, for instance punctuality, into the additional travel time that a passenger on average needs to travel from the origin to the destination stop due to service variability. The average additional travel time may be calculated per stop or per line and enables explicit consideration of service reliability in cost-benefit calculations, since the level of service reliability may be translated into regular travel time. In our research we demonstrate that our indicator enables optimization of network and timetable planning and that the use of traditional indicators may lead to conflicting conclusions in terms of service reliability. We also demonstrate the benefits of using reliability buffer time (RBT, as described by Furth and Muller 2006) as an indication of the effects of uncertain arrivals for passengers (i. e. the variability of the average additional travel time per passenger). To improve service reliability through enhanced network and timetable design, we selected five planning instruments by analysing the causes of service variability. The main external causes are the weather, other traffic, irregular loads and passengers’ behaviour. Other public transport, driver behaviour, schedule quality and network and vehicle design are the main internal causes of unreliability. Since the arrival pattern of passengers is very important when calculating service reliability effects, we performed a passenger survey in The Hague. It showed that passengers tend to arrive at random at their departure stop if scheduled headways are 10 minutes or less. In the case of longer headways, passengers on average plan their arrival about 2 minutes prior to the scheduled vehicle departure time. Applying instruments during the planning stages will reduce the impacts of these causes. At the strategic level, these instruments are: - Terminal design; The configuration and number of tracks and switches at the terminal determines the expected vehicle delay and thus service reliability. - Line length; The length of a line is often related to the level of service variability and thus service reliability. - Line coordination. Multiple lines on a shared track may offer a higher level of service reliability than one line (assuming equal frequencies). The following instruments may be applied at the tactical level: - Trip time determination; In long-headway services, scheduled vehicle departure times at the stop, derived from scheduled trip times, determine the arrival pattern of passengers at their departure stop. Adjusting the scheduled trip time may affect the level of service reliability and passenger waiting time. - Vehicle holding. Holding early vehicles reduces driving ahead of schedule and increases the level of service reliability. The design of the schedule affects the effectiveness of this instrument. The terminal design instrument relates to (new) rail lines with tail tracks as terminal or short-turning facilities. For high-frequency, distributed lines, we recommend compact tail tracks with double crossovers directly after the stop. Concerning (new) lines with a clear break point in passenger pattern, we recommend to split the line or to apply holding points. For long-headway services we propose to use the 35 -percentile value for scheduled trip time. And if parts of lines are very crowded, we suggest investigating the effects of coordination. A tentative cost-effectiveness assessment showed that the <b>tactical</b> <b>instruments</b> (trip determination and vehicle holding) are cost-effective in almost every case. Their benefits are substantial and the costs are nil. These instruments should be considered in the design of every public transport system. However, the vehicle holding instrument is only beneficial if the passenger pattern has a clear break point and trip time determination only is relevant in long-headway services. It is presented that strategic instruments have considerable benefits as well. Optimized terminal design enables enhanced service reliability. Coordination and shorter lines may result in reduced passenger travel times as well. However, these instruments may look costly due to necessary additional infrastructure and or (occasionally) additional vehicles. We demonstrated that the costs are limited in relation to the potential welfare benefits. We roughly estimated the costs of unreliability at  12 million per year in The Hague and we estimated the potential savings at  8 million per year by applying the five planning instruments we analysed in our research. The estimated costs of these instruments are assessed to be only a part of the benefits with a maximum of  3 million per year, showing the added value of the instruments. The results of our international survey show that similar results are achievable in other cities as well. In this thesis we presented planning instruments that facilitate enhanced service reliability. To achieve a higher level of service reliability in practice, we recommend considering service reliability explicitly in the design of infrastructure networks, service networks and timetables using our developed control framework and tools. Service reliability effects should be incorporated in a sophisticated way into cost-benefit analyses of public transport projects, using the average additional travel time per passenger we introduced. This way, welfare gains and additional revenues may be calculated. Optimized strategic and tactical design improves service reliability and also simplifies the operational process with regard to service reliability. Enhanced service planning will allow passengers to benefit from improved service reliability tomorrow...|$|R
40|$|The main {{contribution}} of this thesis is twofold. First, we propose a modeling approach {{that offers a}} generic framework to formulate various types of resource loading and RCCP problems as ILP models. Second, we propose various algorithms that can solve problems of reasonable size, i. e., typically encountered in practice, to optimality. We position resource loading between strategical capacity planning (aggregate planning) and operational capacity planning (scheduling) as a tactical capacity planning problem. Resource loading has been rather underexposed both in the literature and in practice. As a <b>tactical</b> <b>instrument</b> it benefits {{the flexibility of the}} entire production system for various reasons. It serves as a tool in the customer order processing stage, which, in make-to-order manufacturing environments, is typically characterized by much uncertainty. On the demand side there is uncertainty as to what orders can eventually be acquired, while furthermore order characteristics are uncertain or at best partly known. On the supply side there is uncertainty in the availability of the resources. In these situations, a resource loading tool can be used to match production capacity and customer demand, while minimizing the cost of customer order tardiness and the use of nonregular capacity. Resource loading analyses can thus be used to accept/reject orders, or to quote reliable due dates. Resource loading can also serve as a tool to define realistic constraints for the underlying scheduling problem. The resource capacity levels and important milestones (such as release and due dates) are usually supposed to be fixed in scheduling. Resource loading can detect when and where difficulties will occur in scheduling at an early stage, and allocate orders or order parts more efficiently, and, if necessary, properly adjust resource capacity levels (by assigning nonregular capacity) and/or milestones. In this thesis we propose a deterministic approach for modeling and solving resource loading problems. In order to smooth out the aforementioned uncertainty in resource loading problems we formulate resource loading at a higher level of aggregation than scheduling problems (i. e., the tactical level vs. the operational level). In resource loading problems we distinguish (customer) orders that consist of jobs. Jobs are in fact work packages at a higher level of aggregation. In the underlying shop floor scheduling problem, jobs may be further disaggregated into operations or tasks. The difficulty of formulating the resource loading problem as an integer linear programming model is that modeling precedence relations is not straightforward, and the resulting formulations are often extremely hard to solve. We propose a modeling approach that offers a generic framework for modeling various resource loading problems. The proposed model can handle a large variety of practical aspects, such as generalized precedence constraints, various forms of capacity flexibility, tardiness penalties, and minimal duration constraints. The model can handle resource driven resource loading and time driven resource loading simultaneously, which allows making trade-off analyses between due date performance on the one hand, and nonregular capacity levels on the other hand. In this modeling approach we make a distinction between order plans and order schedules. Order plans indicate in which periods a job of an order is allowed to be processed. Order schedules indicate which (part of the) jobs of the order are actually processed in each period. We propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model of the resource loading problem with an exponential number of integer variables. A relatively small and fixed part of these variables determine the required nonregular capacity usage per resource per period. The remaining variables are binary variables that correspond to selecting an order plan for an order. The order plans are thus columns of the coefficient matrix of the model, which are feasible with respect to precedence constraints and order release and due date constraints. The MILP model selects precisely one order plan per order, and determines order schedules that are consistent with these order plans. The model determines the nonregular capacity usage from the order schedules. The precedence relations and release and due date constraints thus {{do not have to be}} applied to the order schedules by the model, since they are embedded in the order plans. However, since there are exponentially many feasible order plans, an explicit model of a problem of regular size is impossible to formulate and solve. We therefore propose various exact and heuristic solution methods, which are all based on first solving the linear programming (LP) relaxation of this formulation by column generation. The pricing problem comprises the determination of feasible order plans with negative reduced costs. The idea of a column generation scheme is that only a small set of variables are required to determine the optimal solution of the LP. It starts from a restricted LP formulation (RLP), which has at least one order plan per order. After each RLP optimization, order plans with negative reduced costs are added to the RLP. The column generation scheme terminates when no order plans with negative reduced costs exist. The optimal solution of the LP is then found. Clearly, if the optimal solution of the linear programming relaxation happens to be integral, we have found an optimal solution for the resource loading problem. Otherwise, we apply a branch-and-price algorithm to determine an optimal solution. We propose various exact and heuristic branching strategies. Furthermore, we propose various approximation techniques that are based on the column generation approach, such as approximation algorithms that proceed by judiciously rounding the linear programming solution to obtain a feasible solution for the original problem. Computational experiments with the resource loading methods show that large resource loading problems with a planning horizon of up to 15 weeks and 5 machine groups can usually be solved to optimality. For larger problems, the branch-and-bound methods usually have to be truncated. Various sensitivity analyses show that adding planning flexibility in some cases makes cases easier to solve, and in other cases makes it harder to prove optimality. The best resource loading method is a combination of two branching strategies. This (exact) method generally outperforms all approximation methods. In resource loading problems we assume linear precedence relations. We also propose extensions of the algorithms that are able to deal with generalized precedence relations. This allows us to use the same model and solution methods to solve Multi-Project Rough-Cut Capacity Planning (RCCP) problems, for which some heuristics have already been proposed in the literature. The main algorithmic implication of the generalized precedence constraints is the generalization of the pricing algorithm. The pricing problem becomes much harder to solve, especially when the project size increases. We propose three different pricing algorithms, so that pricing problems of many sizes can be solved. We propose branch-and-bound algorithms that use one of these pricing algorithms to solve the linear program. We also propose approximation techniques, such as the rounding heuristics that we proposed for resource loading problems, and an improvement heuristic, which tries to improve an existing feasible solution. Computational experiments with the branch-and-bound methods show that RCCP problems for projects of reasonable size can be solved to optimality. For larger problems, the branch-and-bound methods compete with the heuristics from the literature. For RCCP problems with very large projects solving the pricing problem often becomes too computational intensive. As a result, for large RCCP problems the branch-and-bound methods are outperformed by the heuristics from the literature. We note that, from a practical point of view, it is questionable whether it makes sense to solve such large problems to optimality, since information regarding resource availability and project characteristics are usually uncertain in the long term. Solving RCCP problems with a long planning horizon is thus more a mathematical challenge...|$|R
