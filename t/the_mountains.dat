5|$|A barrier jet in the {{low levels}} forms just {{upstream}} of mountain chains, with <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> forcing the jet to be oriented parallel to <b>the</b> <b>mountains.</b> The mountain barrier increases {{the strength of the}} low level wind by 45 percent. In the North American Great Plains a southerly low-level jet helps fuel overnight thunderstorm activity during the warm season, normally in the form of mesoscale convective systems which form during the overnight hours. A similar phenomenon develops across Australia, which pulls moisture poleward from the Coral Sea towards cut-off lows which form mainly across southwestern portions of the continent.|$|E
5|$|A thick {{regolith}} {{layer on}} the lower slopes of <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> and a thin cover of debris on the upper slopes are suggested by the relative absence of large boulders {{on the lower}} mountain flanks.|$|E

5000|$|The show {{began by}} a single maple leaf flying around Wonder Mountain. Then, along with the single leaf, many more leaves began to fly around <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> {{eventually}} disappearing {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mountain</b> would then go completely dark and shortly after snow would begin to fall freezing around <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> causing it to look frozen. Then, <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> slowly began to transition into the [...] "spring" [...] season where the snow began to disappear, plants began to grow and finally a rainbow formed around <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> Butterflies began to fly around <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> completing <b>the</b> [...] "spring" [...] scene for the show. The music then became more intense and the [...] "spring" [...] scene disappeared leaving what looked like a dark mountain. Fake lightning then began to flash and parts of <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> began [...] "exploding" [...] pouring out lava. A fake lightning bolt would then strike a part of <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> leaving a big hole in <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> Two yellow eyes came out of <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> and a dinosaur like creature stepped out screaming and eventually blowing fire around <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> <b>The</b> scene ended when the blowing fire covered up <b>the</b> entire <b>mountain.</b>|$|R

5|$|Delichon is an Old World genus {{with all}} three species {{breeding}} only in the Northern Hemisphere. The common house martin is a widespread migrant breeder across Europe, north Africa and all northern temperate Asia to Kamchatka.

Joseph Franklin purchased land in the Brindabellas in 1849 and attempted {{to set up a}} cattle farm. His livestock were slaughtered by the local Aboriginal people and he was driven back out of <b>the</b> <b>mountains.</b> The rush of prospectors into the Kiandra area through the Brindabellas and <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> {{to the west of the}} ACT as a result of the Kiandra goldrush led to conflict with the Aboriginal people. By the time Franklin returned to the Brindabellas in 1863, the indigenous population had been significantly reduced.|$|E
