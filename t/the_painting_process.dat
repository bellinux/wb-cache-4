5|$|The {{figures of}} both Venus and Cupid were {{significantly}} altered during <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>process,</b> {{the result of}} the artist's corrections to the contours as initially painted. Pentimenti can be seen in Venus's upraised arm, in the position of her left shoulder, and on her head. Infra-red reveals that she was originally shown more upright with her head turned to the left. An area on the left of the painting, extending from Venus's left foot to the left leg and foot of Cupid, is apparently unfinished, but this feature is seen in many other works by Velázquez and was probably deliberate. The painting was given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965–66, which showed it to be in good condition, and with very little paint added later by other artists, contrary to what some earlier writers had asserted.|$|E

25|$|Ivey was {{acquainted with}} Mark Tobey, Morris Graves, {{and other members}} of the 'Northwest School', and was close friends with Richard Gilkey and many of the Skagit Valley-based {{painters}} who were considered by some critics to represent a second generation of the Northwest School. However, his deeply personal style of abstraction showed more of the influence of Still, Rothko, and others he studied under at the California School of Fine Arts. He found inspiration in observation of the real world, but his intense immersion in <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>process</b> transformed what he saw into lush abstractions that emphasized color and the picture plane. In Ivey's paintings, shapes are secondary to color in the development of spaces, and delicate neutral grays set off glowing patches of bright color.|$|E

25|$|Woman with a Horse was {{conceived}} {{in such a}} way that the viewer is obliged to contemplate the manifold surface of the painting for an extended period of time, piecing together the recognizable forms, not just in space, but in time; due to the temporal evolution resulting from the act of moving around the subject (during <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>process).</b> Only then do the more obscure structures become legible with the topological context of the multi-dimension space of the whole. The radical new concept based on non-conventional precepts of space and time transformed the canvas from something quasi-static to something that possessed dynamic evolutionary characteristics. No longer governed by Euclidean geometry (or classical Renaissance perspective), Metzinger's Woman with a Horse is composed of a series of ellipses, curvilinear and rectilinear structures and planes juxtaposed and distributed throughout the canvas in complex myriad combinations of abstract volumetric forms that suggest rather than define the underlying subject.|$|E
2500|$|Ettinger's {{research}} concerns {{light and}} space, {{and in this}} it follows from Manet and Rothko. Her subjects concern the human condition and the tragedy of war, and her work in this aspect [...] follows on after artists such as Käthe Kollwitz and Francisco Goya. <b>The</b> <b>painting</b> <b>process</b> engages a space of passage between figures and abstraction, and her attitude to abstraction resonates with the spiritual concerns of Agnes Martin and Hilma af Klint. Another major subject in her work is the unconscious {{and in particular the}} feminine and the maternal.

2500|$|Bathsheba at Her Bath is a reinterpretation of two antique reliefs {{familiar}} to Rembrandt through engravings. A print by Tobias Stimmer {{may have been}} influential, as it includes the pillar, a curtain drawn across the background and Bathsheba's downcast gaze. It was begun around 1647 and altered and repainted until its completion in 1654. Originally the canvas may have been larger and of a vertical format. It might have been trimmed some ten centimeters at the left and at least 20 centimeters in height; It is speculated that Rembrandt cut the canvas himself in order to intensify {{the impact of the}} figure. [...] show that at some point late in <b>the</b> <b>painting</b> <b>process,</b> he lowered Bathsheba's head from its initial more upward angle, thereby increasing the sense of the figure's withdrawal into reverie. Initially she appeared to be looking {{out of the corner of}} her eye, as if watching David; in the present version her gaze is softened, in the general direction of her maid but focused on no particular object, imparting a feeling of solemnity and contemplation. There was no letter in her hand in the original conception, and it is also possible that her lap, thighs, and right arm were once draped.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} to validate a simulated model of an automotive factory spray <b>paint</b> gun. <b>The</b> project ensures that repeatable and valid data are obtained in the simulation of a <b>paint</b> <b>process.</b> A simulated <b>paint</b> gun model was created using DELMIA IGRIP simulation software; an interactive, 3 D graphic simulation tool for designing, optimizing, and programming robotic paint booths off-line. IGRIP is used to generate optimized robot paths using the workpiece CAD geometry and download robot motion and process programs. A Design of Experiment (DOE) study was executed to validate <b>the</b> simulated <b>paint</b> gun model. <b>The</b> DOE was performed using a physical paint robot and a virtual paint robot. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) {{was performed on the}} two experiments in order to detect any differences in average performance of <b>the</b> <b>paint</b> <b>process</b> parameters tested. Understanding the contribution of each factor was significant to determine the validity of the simulation. The comparison of the outputs of the two experiments provided an assessment and validation of <b>the</b> simulated <b>paint</b> gun model. <b>The</b> IGRIP simulation software is limited in its abilities to quantify expected improvements of all paint quality characteristics in that it is not able to consider parameters of viscosity, humidity, temperature, air velocity. The IGRIP model that was developed must be calibrated to mimic the physical process results.

40|$|In {{the current}} study {{we focus on the}} {{transport}} of the charged particles in <b>the</b> electrostatic <b>painting</b> <b>process,</b> where both aerodynamic and electrical forces play an equal important role. One essential requirement for a successful simulation of such painting is using suitable solver to model complicated turbulent flow and implementation of all relevant electrical effects including static electric field and space charge. Although today some commercial CFD (computational fluid dynamics) codes, in which different turbulent models are implemented, are available on the flow simulation for industry application, little commercial codes are available on modelling both complicated flow field and inhomogeneous electrical field with space charge. Most of the CFD codes depend on finite volume method, whereas the numerical models for solving space charge field are usually developed using finite difference and finite element method. Therefore there is a modelling gap for the application where both flow field and electrical field are equally important. In the current paper, the results of the numerical simulation for wet and powder <b>paint</b> spray <b>painting</b> <b>processes</b> with three different spray guns are showed. The practically relevant operating conditions, e. g. airflow rate, particle loading or high voltage were applied.
