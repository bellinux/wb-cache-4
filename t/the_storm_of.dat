5|$|October 9, 1804 – <b>The</b> <b>Storm</b> <b>of</b> October 1804 strikes near Atlantic City as {{a strong}} Category 2 or weak Category 3 hurricane, sinking or {{beaching}} many ships in the Mid–Atlantic. The hurricane later produces a snow storm in New England.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Pensford was an {{important}} coal mining area during the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries when it formed part of the Somerset Coalfield, although there are no working coal mines today. The line of the now disused Bristol and North Somerset Railway runs south from Bristol crossing over the River Chew on the surviving distinctive Pensford Viaduct and on to Midsomer Norton. The area suffered serious flooding during <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> 10 July 1968, prompting localised evacuation of populated valley areas in the lower parts of the valley, around Pensford and Keynsham.|$|E

5|$|On December17, President George H. W. Bush {{declared}} three Connecticut counties as disaster areas. The next day, {{the president}} declared 12New Jersey counties as disaster areas, including {{all of the}} counties along the Atlantic coast. The declaration allowed for $46million in relief for public damages and $265million for insured damage in the state. On December21, the president declared 9Massachusetts counties and 5New York counties as disaster areas. On January15, 1993, Sussex County, Delaware was also declared a disaster area. Across the nor'easter's path, 25,142people received assistance from Federal Emergency Management Agency, equating to $346,150,356 in federal aid. Only {{three months after the}} nor'easter struck, another nor'easter caused more severe damage across a larger region of the eastern United States. The March nor'easter, known as <b>the</b> <b>Storm</b> <b>of</b> the Century, killed 310people and left over $1.5billion in damage (1993USD).|$|E
5|$|Once York surrendered, {{the allied}} army soon dispersed. Leven took his troops north to besiege Newcastle upon Tyne and Carlisle. He sent dispatches to Scotland {{ordering}} that all runaways from the Covenanter regiments which broke at Marston Moor be returned, {{but not before}} every tenth deserter was hanged according to article 14 of Leven's Articles of War. Once reunited with the Army of both Kingdoms, {{the remnants of the}} six broken regiments were put to base service such as latrine duties and the disposing of corpses until they got the chance to redeem themselves during <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> Newcastle. Manchester's army returned to Lincolnshire and eventually moved into the south of England {{to take part in the}} Second Battle of Newbury.|$|E
5|$|September 27, 1985– Hurricane Gloria {{parallels}} the New Jersey coastline just offshore as a Category2 hurricane. Its arrival forces 95,000citizens to evacuate, while eleven casinos in Atlantic City are closed, {{resulting in a}} loss of $7million (1985USD). Dubbed by some as <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> <b>of</b> the century, the hurricane is expected to become the first hurricane to hit the New Jersey coastline since the hurricane in 1903, though a last minute turn spares the state. While passing by the state, Gloria caused a storm surge of 4.6feet (1.4m) in Ventnor City and a wind gust of 80mph (129km) in Ocean City. Despite coming within miles of the coast, the storm caused only light rainfall along the shoreline, though further inland there were reports of over 5inches (13cm). Strong winds down trees and power lines, leaving 237,000 without power after the storm. Overall, damage is minor, and some were even disappointed at the lack of damage from the proclaimed storm of the century.|$|E

5|$|The public {{remained}} mostly {{unaware of}} mass burials {{on the site}} until the 1990s, until the Sankofa Society conducted a well-publicized blessing ceremony in 1991. Kolkana refused to sell or donate the land {{back to the city}} of West Palm Beach, but halted any plans for construction on the property. In 1992, city work crews located human remains on the property using a backhoe. The bones were reburied, but their locations were marked. Resident Robert Hazard established <b>the</b> <b>Storm</b> <b>of</b> '28 Memorial Park Coalition in 1999 as a non-profit organization used to reacquire the land and solicit donations for a memorial complex. The complex was originally intended to include an educational center and a museum about African American pioneers and migrant farm workers, at a cost of approximately $6.1million. Organizations such as the Sankofa Society proposed a less sophisticated plan of erecting an information wall and a large marble headstone, at a far less expensive cost of about $43,000.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} several decades, the mass African American burial site in West Palm Beach was largely {{forgotten}} by the public. The city later sold the property, which switched ownership over the years. In 1991, the property was owned by a private individual when the Sankofa Society conducted a blessing ceremony at the site, well-publicized by the local media. Around that time, Robert Hazard, a resident of West Palm Beach, established <b>the</b> <b>Storm</b> <b>of</b> '28 Memorial Park Coalition Inc. to fight for recognition of the black victims of the storm. In December2000, the city of West Palm Beach purchased the land back for $180,000. Plans for construction of a memorial began. The site was designated a U.S. National Register of Historic Places and a historical marker was added in 2003 during the 75th anniversary of the hurricane. The inequity has caused ongoing racial friction that still exists. The effects of the hurricane on black migrant workers is dramatized in Zora Neale Hurston's novel Their Eyes Were Watching God.|$|E
5|$|The 1804 Snow {{hurricane}} (also {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Storm</b> <b>of</b> October1804) {{was the first}} tropical cyclone in recorded history known to produce snowfall, with Hurricane Ginny in 1963 and Hurricane Sandy in 2012 being the next such systems to do so. An unusual late-season storm in 1804, it yielded vast amounts of snow, rain, and powerful winds across the northeastern United States. Prior to its approach towards the East Coast of the United States, it passed through the Caribbean Sea on 4October, and later emerged near Georgetown, South Carolina. By early on 9 October, a trough near the Virginia Capes turned the disturbance toward New England. Soon thereafter, the hurricane's abundant moisture clashed with an influx of cold Canadian air, leading to the deepening of the resulting pressure gradient and provoking inland intensification. While situated over Massachusetts, it attained its peak intensity of 110mph (175km/h), undergoing an extratropical transition. Even as it drifted towards the Canadian maritimes, consequently gradually weakening, precipitation persisted for another {{two days before the}} snowstorm finally subsided on 11October.|$|E

5|$|The {{precursor}} to the disturbance brought locally heavy rainfall to the Yucatán Peninsula, with a maximum of 7.09inches (18cm) in Lázaro Cárdenas, Quintana Roo. The depression produced intense precipitation across central and eastern Cuba, peaking at 12.4inches (31.5cm) in Topes de Collantes. In Victoria de Las Tunas, a rainfall total of 8.6inches (21.8cm) set the new record most rainfall in 24hours. The rainfall caused flooding of rivers and lakes behind dams, and in some places, residents required rescue from the roofs of their houses. Officials forced the evacuation of 40,000people in several provinces, and across the country, the storm destroyed 1,860homes and damaged 16,500more. The flooding blocked mountainous highways in Santiago de Cuba Province, and in Las Tunas Province railway lines were damaged. Widespread crop damage occurred just two months after <b>the</b> <b>Storm</b> <b>of</b> the Century left similar heavy damage. The flooding damaged 87sugar production centers. The depression killed seven {{people in the country}} with another five missing, as reported by a newspaper on the day after the depression left the island. After the storm passed, the Cuban government activated the Civil Defense, while National Relief Services worked to rescue all people affected by the flooding.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a day of}} Cyclone Waka's {{passage in}} Tonga, the Government of New Zealand {{deployed}} an aircraft to survey the scale of damage and reestablish contact with the Tongan Islands. This aircraft was sent {{in accordance with the}} FRANZ Agreement, enacted in 1992, which states that assests from one country would be used in relief operations. On January2, the head of Tonga's Disaster Office announced that they would likely need international assistance to recover from the storm. Due to the substantial damage to agriculture, food shortages were expected to impact the region over the following months. By January7, the Red Cross began sending supplies to Tonga. Hundreds of tents and tarpaulins were brought in by an Australian AC-130 to help with the recovery process. On January12, a New Zealand Lockheed C-130 Hercules carrying US$700,000 worth of supplies flew to the area to deliver aid. An additional US$700,000 was given in relief funds to repair damage wrought by <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b> <b>Of</b> this, US$500,000 would be used to repair schools that were damaged or destroyed and the remaining US$200,000 would be used for emergency lighting, cooking and food supply recovery.|$|E

This figure was later confirmed by the National Hurricane Center. The government also estimates damages at close to $1.9 billion. Approximately 2.1million people were affected by <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> <b>of</b> whom 1.4million (12percent of Haiti's population) were left in need of assistance.
