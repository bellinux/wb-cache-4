5|$|Senate Majority Leader Dole and Gingrich {{appointed}} Kemp {{to head a}} {{tax reform}} commission, (the Kemp Commission), in response to voter concern that the tax code had become <b>too</b> <b>complicated.</b> Kemp championed many issues including the flat tax, which he formally proposed after he was appointed. The proposal included some politically popular income tax deductions, such as mortgage interest, but it remained fairly general. Among the 1996 Republican Party candidates, both Steve Forbes and Phil Gramm proposed the flat tax.|$|E
5|$|During {{development}} {{there was}} a concern that the game might initially seem <b>too</b> <b>complicated.</b> At {{the end of the}} videotape there is a special fifteen-minute presentation called the rules presentation in which a voice-over along with the Gatekeeper explains the game, the characters and how to play. The rules presentation was created to help explain the game to new players. The videotape can be forwarded {{to the start of the}} instructions. During the rules presentation a game is played by actors who are dressed as three Harbingers – Baron Samedi, Anne de Chantraine and Elizabeth Bathory – and three Soul Rangers. The demonstration game is used throughout the rules presentation to help explain how to play the game.|$|E
50|$|There are general algorithms, {{which produce}} always the {{complete}} factorisation of any polynomial, in either one variable (the univariate case) or several variables (the multivariate case); see Factorization of polynomials. These algorithms are implemented {{and are available}} in most computer algebra systems. They involve advanced properties of polynomials, and are <b>too</b> <b>complicate</b> for being used for hand-written computation. There are also a few elementary methods, which are well suited for hand-written computation, and do not always allow finding the complete factorization in degree higher than four.|$|R
3000|$|If {{the product}} of the first {{derivatives}} of t_ 2 c- 3 / 2 and t_ 2 c- 1 / 2 is less than 0, i.e., S_i^(1) (t_ 2 c- 1 / 2) ×S_i^(1) (t_ 2 c- 3 / 2) < 0, then there exists an extremum point in range [...] (t_ 2 c- 3 / 2,t_ 2 c- 1 / 2) which is not captured by our extremum point retrieving algorithm. Since such missing extremum points are also very important for users’ observation, the method for estimating these missing critical points are required. The traditional methods, such as curve tessellation techniques [29], are <b>too</b> <b>complicate</b> to solve such problem, and not practical for WSNs. However, in some situations, the missing critical points can be obtained easily just as shown in the following Theorem 4.|$|R
40|$|There are {{systems to}} provide an {{opportunity}} for local people to participate in the process of forest management. But there are some problems in implementing those systems effectively. Supporting measures is required for implementing them effectively. This paper analyzes some of those measures that are, the EIA system, forest certification, and the indigenous people's right. According to those analyses, a fair system needs to be constructed to support local people participation. 1 Why the participation of local people needs to be supported Recently, it has being recognized that participation of local people is impor-tant in the forest management. But sometimes there is no opportunity legally for those people to participate in this process. Even though there is an opportunity to participate in the forest conservation, sometimes people could not utilize it effectively or that process generates adverse results.

5|$|During {{the latter}} part of 1970, Townshend plotted a follow up Tommy: Lifehouse, which was to be a {{multi-media}} project symbolising the relationship between an artist and his audience. He developed ideas in his home studio, creating layers of synthesizers, and the Young Vic theatre in London was booked for a series of experimental concerts. Townshend approached the gigs with optimism; the rest of the band were just happy to be gigging again. Eventually, the others complained to Townshend that the project was <b>too</b> <b>complicated</b> and they should simply record another album. Things deteriorated until Townshend had a nervous breakdown and abandoned Lifehouse.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{the musical}} life of Britain was {{drastically}} curtailed. The LSO was helped to survive by large donations from Sir Thomas Beecham, who also subsidised the Hallé and the Royal Philharmonic Society. For a year {{he took the}} role, though not the title, of chief conductor of the LSO. In 1916 his millionaire father died and Beecham's financial affairs became <b>too</b> <b>complicated</b> for any further musical philanthropy on his part. In 1917 the LSO's directors agreed unanimously that they would promote no more concerts {{until the end of}} the war. The orchestra played for other managements, and managed to survive, although the hitherto remunerative work for regional choral societies dwindled to almost nothing.|$|E
5|$|For the sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, {{producer}} Kitase {{thought that}} the greatest fan expectation was for the reunion of Tidus and Yuna after their separation in the first game. The game generated rumors about Tidus' connection with the villain, Shuyin, who was physically similar and had the same actors. Square responded that such a storyline, given Tidus' nature, would be <b>too</b> <b>complicated.</b> For the remastering of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2, producer Kitase's motivation was to have people {{too young to have}} played the games experience them; his son was only old enough to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{magnetic tape}} recorders, not commercially {{available in the}} U.S. until 1948, were <b>too</b> expensive, <b>complicated,</b> and bulky to compete with these consumer-level wire recorders. During {{the first half of}} the 1950s, however, tape recorders which were sufficiently affordable, simple, and compact to be suitable for home and office use started appearing and they rapidly drove wire recorders from the market.|$|R
30|$|We {{replaced}} the traditional fine-tuning approach with the proposed training approach for Inceptionv 3 and ResNetv 2 architectures, i.e., Inceptionv 3 -proposed and ResNetv 2 -proposed. The improvements are obvious on both architectures, which achieved {{the best and}} second-best accuracy. As suggested in [54], the relation behind the RGB and NIR data is highly non-linear, the more sophisticated solutions probably capture the highly complex relations. But in our experiment, we noticed that the Inceptionv 3 -proposed model achieved comparable performance to RestNetv 2 -proposed model, which usually should have much higher accuracy. We also tried to use non-linear activation in the feature fusion layer, i.e., RELU, Sigmoid, to enhance its non-linear representation ability. But the performance of Inceptionv 3 -proposed model and ResNetv 2 -proposed model was decreased to 89.6 and 88.3, respectively. This {{may be caused by}} the small number of our training samples, which is not enough to fully explore the advantage of <b>too</b> <b>complicate</b> models, such as ResNetv 2.|$|R

5|$|Kumar {{requested}} Nagarjuna a year's time {{to complete}} and provide the finishing touches to the script. The latter read the script to director K. Raghavendra Rao, who suggested Kumar develop a simpler version, as the original was <b>too</b> <b>complicated.</b> The rewritten version was read to Nagarjuna in {{two and a half}} hours and to Nageswara Rao over six hours, as the latter wanted every detail to be clear. Due to the complex nature of the second half, the latter suggested Kumar to add a comedy plotline between grandfather and grandson. After its incorporation into the script, and after considering the titles Hum and Trayam, Manam was chosen as the film's title on Nageswara Rao's suggestion.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 1969, four partner nations– United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, {{agreed to}} form a {{multinational}} company, Panavia Aircraft GmbH, to develop and manufacture the MRCA. The project's aim was to produce an aircraft capable of undertaking missions in the tactical strike, reconnaissance, air defence, and maritime roles; thus allowing the MRCA to replace several different aircraft then in use by the partner nations. Various concepts, including alternative fixed-wing and single-engine designs, were studied while defining the aircraft. The Netherlands {{pulled out of the}} project in 1970, citing that the aircraft was <b>too</b> <b>complicated</b> and technical for the RNLAF's preferences, which had sought a simpler aircraft with outstanding manoeuvrability. An additional blow was struck by the German requirement reduced from an initial 600 aircraft to 324 in 1972.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} who {{originally}} suggested the yellow, green and red, but the idea is usually attributed to Lithuanian exiles living elsewhere in Europe or in the United States during the 19th century. These three colors were frequently used in folk weavings and traditional dress. At the Great Seimas of Vilnius of 1905, this flag was favored over the Vytis banner as {{the flag of the}} Lithuanian nation. The Vytis, strongly advocated by Jonas Basanavičius, was not chosen for three reasons: the first was that as part of the drive for national identity, the Seimas wished to distance itself somewhat from the flag of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which also encompassed now-distinct nations such as Belarus, and Ukraine. The second issue was the choice of the color red by revolutionaries who aligned themselves with Marxist or Communist causes. And finally, the flag with Vytis would be <b>too</b> <b>complicated</b> and could not be easily sewn.|$|E

5|$|The games {{interacted with}} each other: players could begin {{with any of}} the three titles and have the actions of the first game affect the story of the other two, a concept {{conceived}} by Okamoto. More than ten of Flagship's scenarists, among them Resident Evil writer Junichi Miyashita, worked simultaneously on the three stories. The developers considered using a cell phone adapter to transfer data, but later decided on a password system. The limitations of this system and the difficulty of coordinating three games proved <b>too</b> <b>complicated,</b> so the team scaled back to two titles at Miyamoto's suggestion. Condensing the games into a single cartridge was never considered, as the prospect of multiple endings and the added replay value afforded by the ability to play the titles in either order was very attractive. Oracle of Seasons was adapted from Mystical Seed of Power, Oracle of Ages was adapted from Mystical Seed of Wisdom, and Mystical Seed of Courage was canceled.|$|E
5|$|The {{people of}} South Park decide to turn Muhammad {{over to the}} Gingers, fearing the {{violence}} that will befall their town if they do not. The celebrities are angered by this change in events, but refuse to resort to violence for fear of ruining their careers. Instead, the celebrities decide to awaken the rebuilt Mecha-Streisand, a giant mechanical monster form of Barbra Streisand, who previously terrorized the town of South Park before being destroyed. The celebrities hope to use Mecha-Streisand to force South Park to accept their demands. Meanwhile, due to the chain of events, Cartman decides Connor's scheme has become <b>too</b> <b>complicated</b> and tries to quit, but Connor convinces him to stay involved by revealing that the townspeople of South Park have lied to Cartman about his true father. Although they previously claimed his hermaphroditic mother was also his father, Connor insists this is a lie. Cartman confronts his school teacher Mr. Garrison and Garrison's old hand puppet Mr. Hat, who admits to Cartman there was indeed a cover-up. Mecha-Streisand roars threateningly and continues her reign of destruction as the episode ends.|$|E
5|$|Capcom's design {{philosophy}} for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was {{to maximize}} gameplay depth and minimize complexity. According to Niitsuma, the development team sought {{to create a}} game that would reach out to longtime fans of the series, while simultaneously expanding their user base to those familiar with the characters, but perhaps not with fighting games in general. The urge {{to reach out to}} new players also stemmed from Marvel's recent success in the Hollywood film industry. Capcom's global head of production, Keiji Inafune, expressed interest in appealing to a worldwide audience. These ideas drove the decision to retool the fighting system, which was criticized in past iterations for being <b>too</b> <b>complicated</b> for casual players. These changes include the implementation of the three-button attack system from Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and the addition of Simple Mode. Unlike previous titles in the series, Capcom had no plans for an arcade release, and focused only on console versions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. When asked if Capcom was planning to release the game on other consoles, Niitsuma did not dismiss the possibility for a Nintendo Wii version; however, this ultimately did not come to fruition.|$|E
25|$|But {{loudness}} jumps are {{not limited}} to inter-channel differences; they also exist between programme material within the same channel. Loudness differences are a frequent source of audience complaints, especially TV commercials and promos that seem <b>too</b> loud. <b>Complicating</b> this is that many broadcasters use (quasi-)peak meters and peak-levelling. Unfortunately the peak level reading does not correlate well with the perceived loudness. It basically should only be used to prevent overmodulation.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Documents are {{unstructured}} data consisting of natural language. Document surrogate means the structured data converted from original documents to process them in computer systems. Document surrogate is usually represented into {{a list of}} words. Because not all words in a document reflect its content, {{it is necessary to}} select imp ortant words related with its content among them. Such important words are called keywords and they are selected with a particular equation based on TF (Term Frequency) and IDF (inverted Document Frequency). Actually, not only TF and IDF but also the position of each word in the document and the inclusion of the word in the title should be considered to select keywords among words contained in the text. The equation based on these factors gets <b>too</b> <b>complicate</b> to be applied to the selection of keywords. This paper proposes the neural network model, back propagation, in which these factors are used as the features and feature vectors are generated, and with which keywords are selected. This paper will show that backpropagation outperforms the equation in distinguishing keywords. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a surge of {{interest}} in Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) and Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) models that combine logic with probabilities. Structure learning of these systems is an intersection area of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and statistical learning (SL). However, ILP cannot deal with probabilities, SL cannot model relational hypothesis. The biggest challenge of integrating these two machine learning frameworks is how to estimate {{the probability of a}} logic clause only from the observation of grounded logic atoms. Many current methods models a joint probability by representing clause as graphical model and literals as vertices in it. This model is still <b>too</b> <b>complicate</b> and only can be approximate by pseudo-likelihood. We propose Inductive Logic Boosting framework to transform the relational dataset into a feature-based dataset, induces logic rules by boosting Problog Rule Trees and relaxes the independence constraint of pseudo-likelihood. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that the AUC-PR and AUC-ROC value of ILP learned rules are higher than current state-of-the-art SRL methods.

5|$|Higinbotham {{designed}} {{a game that}} used an oscilloscope to display {{the path of a}} simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from the side. The attached computer calculated the path of the ball and reversed its path when it hit the ground. The game also simulated the ball hitting the net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance. Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer, each consisting of a button and a knob. Pressing the button hit the ball, and turning a knob controlled the angle of the shot. Originally, Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity of the shot, but decided it would make the controller <b>too</b> <b>complicated.</b> The device was designed in a few hours with the help of colleague Dave Potter and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak. While most of the circuitry was based on vacuum tubes and relays, the circuits to display the graphics on the oscilloscope used transistors, then beginning to replace vacuum tubes in the electronics industry. Excluding the oscilloscope and controller, the game's circuitry approximately took up the space of a microwave oven.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} in the St. Paul Daily Globe, the {{reporter}} summed up the events of Adams' exhibition on April 26, 1888:The great finger billiard exhibition came off last night at the Standard billiard hall to a packed house, and those who saw Yank Adams handle the spheres were more than delighted.... Shot after shot were made in lightning rapidity, spotting the ball, running the whole length of the rail, crossing over, with two cushions and counting, going under hats and in between them, cutting the letter S and making the carom, jump shots, masses and hundreds of others <b>too</b> <b>complicated</b> to put in type. Mr. A.M. Doherty played a game with the exhibitor, and at twenty-eight points left the balls in a scattered position, which were gathered at one shot by Mr. Adams, who made fifty shots in sixty seconds. What seemed his most difficult shot was that of placing fifteen balls in a line, and a piece of chalk on the last ball. The hand ball was then dropped a distance of two feet, described a semi-circle, making a carom on all of the balls and freezing against the last ball. Adams' finger shots discount Schaeffer, Slosson and J. Carter combined.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} {{to these}} games include the cathode-ray tube amusement device, {{the earliest known}} interactive electronic game {{as well as the}} first to incorporate a cathode ray tube screen. The player simulates an artillery shell trajectory on a CRT screen connected to an oscilloscope, with a set of knobs and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program. It was patented by Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann in 1947. While the idea behind the game was potentially to use a television set as the display and thus sell the invention to consumers, as Goldsmith and Mann worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories, the patent, the first for an electronic game, was never used and the device never manufactured beyond the original handmade prototypes. This, along with the lack of electronic logic circuits, keeps the device from being considered the first video game. Around {{the same time as the}} device was invented, the earliest known written computer game was developed by Alan Turing and David Champernowne in 1948, a chess simulation called Turochamp, though it was never actually implemented on a computer as the code was <b>too</b> <b>complicated</b> to run on the machines of the time. Turing tested the code in a game in 1952 where he mimicked the operation of the code in a real chess game against an opponent, but was never able to run the program on a computer.|$|E
