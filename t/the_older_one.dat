5|$|As is his pattern, Hosseini drew on {{his early}} {{experiences}} in Afghanistan {{to create the}} foundation of the book. He states that his travels to Afghanistan later in life also influenced his writing, albeit involuntarily. For example, during a 2009 visit he met two young sisters in a remote village outside Kabul. <b>The</b> <b>older</b> <b>one,</b> who he estimated to be around six years old, acted as a mother figure to the younger girl. Hosseini stated that their bond formed {{the foundation of the}} relationship between Abdullah and Pari in the novel.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} mentioned by Franz Nopcsa in 1923 as a subfamily of Acanthopholidae, {{along with the}} previously defined Acanthopholinae. The family has gone through many taxonomic revisions since it was defined by Nopcsa in 1902. It is now recognized as a junior synonym of the family Nodosauridae. The subfamily now includes the genera Anoplosaurus, Europelta, Hungarosaurus, and Struthiosaurus, designated as the type genus. Because of the instability of Acanthopholis, the generic namesake of Acanthopholinae, and its current identification as a nomen dubium, Struthiosaurinae, the next named group, was decidedly used over <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
5|$|The present building, {{dating from}} around 1283 to 1537, mostly {{replaced}} the earlier monastic church founded in 1093 {{which was built}} in the Norman style. It is believed that the newer church was built around <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>one.</b> That the few remaining parts of the Norman church are of small proportions, while the height and width of the Gothic church are generous would seem to confirm this belief. Aspects of the design of the Norman interior are still visible in the north transept, which retains wall arcading and a broadly moulded arch leading to the sacristy, which was formerly a chapel. The transept has retained an early 16th-century coffered ceiling with decorated bosses, two of which are carved with the arms of HenryVIII and Cardinal Wolsey.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> were a {{race that}} had evolved even earlier than the Necrontyr, but along {{substantially}} different lines. Where the Necrontyr developed purely on science and technology, leaving spirituality and mysticism in the dark annals of their history, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> embraced both science and their spirituality. In their alternate philosophies and mystic practices, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> eventually gained access to the primordial Warp, but not the Warp {{as it is known}} in the 41st Millennium. In the days of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones,</b> <b>the</b> Warp was a shining parallel reality where emotions, thoughts, and even dreams were intensely reflected and molded together. Through natural fluency and masterful concentration, <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> used <b>the</b> Warp to become a civilization of powerful psykers, with supernatural abilities far exceeding any other sentient race in the galaxy. These abilities gave <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> a harmonious bond with (as well as control over) great cosmic forces, bestowing onto them the gift of immortality and near-omniscience. It is not known why <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> refused to trade or even interact with the expanding Necrontyr empire at the time, however their continual refusal to share their knowledge, most especially on the secrets of immortality, would eventually garner the enmity of the short-lived Necrontyr. This simmering hatred was used as a basis by the Triarchs to wage war with <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b>|$|R

5|$|Fauré {{was elected}} to the Institut de France in 1909, after his {{father-in-law}} and Saint-Saëns, both long-established members, had canvassed strongly on his behalf. He won the ballot by a narrow margin, with 18 votes against 16 for the other candidate, Widor. In the same year a group of young composers led by Ravel and Koechlin broke with the Société Nationale de Musique, which under the presidency of Vincent d'Indy had become a reactionary organisation, and formed a new group, the Société Musicale Indépendante. While Fauré accepted the presidency of this society, he also remained a member of <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>one</b> and continued on the best of terms with d'Indy; his sole concern was the fostering of new music. In 1911 he oversaw the Conservatoire's move to new premises in the rue de Madrid. During this time, Fauré developed serious problems with his hearing. Not only did he start to go deaf, but sounds became distorted, so that high and low notes sounded painfully out of tune to him.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, many {{researchers}} {{have come to believe}} that one variant of the northeastern Iberian script, <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>one</b> according to the archaeological contexts, distinguished voicing in the plosives by adding a stroke to the glyphs for the alveolar (/d/~/t/) and velar (/g/~/k/) syllables, creating distinct glyphs for unvoiced /t/ and /k/, and restricting the original glyphs to voiced /d/ and /g/. (This is the so-called dual signary model: see northeastern Iberian script.) If correct, this innovation would parallel the creation of the Latin letter G by the addition of a stroke to C, which had previously stood for both /k/ and /g/.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the Lizardmen begins {{with the arrival of}} <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> in <b>the</b> Warhammer world; some of the Slann {{traveled}} among the stars with their godlike masters. When <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> arrived on <b>the</b> Warhammer world, they settled in Lustria where they created the Sub species of the Lizardmen (Saurus, Skinks and Kroxigors) from creatures already living there as servants that would help the Slann to fulfill the Plan of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones.</b> During this time, generations of Slann were spawned on the earth as it was being shaped to how <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> wished it. Armies of Saurus destroyed unwanted races, and <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> created <b>the</b> races of Elves (powerful magicians), Dwarfs (magic resistant), and Men. Sometime during the earliest days of the Warhammer world, the Orcs and Goblins came into being, probably the result of some interstellar spore or parasite that had hitched a ride on <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Ones' ship. They were not part of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> Plan, but despite many attempts to exterminate this parasitic race, the Greenskins survived, and to this day, they are the bane of the civilised races.|$|R

50|$|One {{of the few}} races <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> {{encountered}} {{that were}} already sentient without their intervention were the Necrontyr. Where <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> were long-lived, with an average lifespan lasting for many Terran millennia, and had access to technology {{that allowed them to}} travel from settled world to world instantaneously through a network of Warpgates called the Webway, the Necrontyr were short-lived, and were bound to but one world. The Necrontyr grew increasingly jealous of <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones,</b> and eventually set about going to war with them to wipe them out and claim their technology. <b>The</b> <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> easily outmaneuvered these early, clumsy Necrontyr strikes by making use of their Webway, and the Necrontyr were soon defeated.|$|R

25|$|A {{team can}} acquire players through {{any of the}} three ways: the annual player auction, trading players with other teams during the trading windows, and signing {{replacements}} for unavailable players. Players sign up for the auction and also set their base price, and are bought by the franchise that bids the highest for them. Unsold players at the auction are eligible to be signed up as replacement signings. In the trading windows, a player can only be traded with his consent, with the franchise paying the difference if any between the old and new contract. If the new contract is worth more than <b>the</b> <b>older</b> <b>one,</b> the difference is shared between the player and the franchise selling the player.

During his innings of 203 not out, he made a partnership of 397 runs with Qasim Umar—who also made a double century in the innings—for third wicket, which was eighth highest overall and second highest for the third wicket at that time. Miandad's score of 306 runs from three innings were the most by any batsmen in the series, and his average for the score was 153.00.
