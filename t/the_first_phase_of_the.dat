With rising {{tensions}} in Europe, the British began to withdraw troops from Palestine for use elsewhere.

5|$|Prior to {{completion}} of the project's first phase, the vicinity around the Wazir Khan mosque had been encroached upon by illegally erected shops which blocked off much of the mosque from the surrounding neighborhood.

Wazir Khan Chowk was extensively rehabilitated by removal of encroachments, while the well of Dina Nath was restored.
