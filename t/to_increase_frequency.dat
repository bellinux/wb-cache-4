In 1937, the first film industry-standard loudspeaker system, [...] "The [...] System for Theatres" [...] (a two-way system), was introduced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

John Kenneth Hilliard, James Bullough Lansing, and Douglas Shearer all played roles in creating the system. At the 1939 New York World's Fair, a very large two-way public address system was mounted on a tower at Flushing Meadows.

2500|$|SAS {{announced}} in September 1988 that it intended {{to change this}} model. DC-9s and MD-80s would fly nonstop from Oslo to Alta, and then a hub and spoke system would be established by SAS Commuter whereby they would feed into the Alta, which was designated as hub. This led <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>frequency</b> {{on some of the}} feeder routes, for instance from three to six on the Tromsø to Alta service and Kirkenes going from two to five daily services. Also Bardufoss Airport lost its direct service and was instead fed into Bodø. Seven Fokker 50s were reserved for Norlink, which also took over all SAS flights operating between airports from Trondheim Airport, Værnes and northwards. For instance, a F50 used [...] of fuel from Tromsø to Kirkenes, compared to 2.2 tonnes used by a DC-9. Overall, SAS hoped to save NOK60 million per year on the new network. A route from Tromsø to Murmansk Airport in Russia was also introduced.|$|E

50|$|Not {{only the}} impacts of The IPCC Fifth Assessment Report concludes that there is ‘robust evidence’ for an {{increase}} of gender inequalities {{as a result of}} weather events {{as well as for the}} perpetuation of differential vulnerabilities. The increase of inequalities due to climate change can have several reasons. For example, girls often face more serious risks than boys due to unequal distribution of scarce resources within the household. This effect is amplified by climate change induced resource scarcity.Furthermore, Climate change often results in an increase of out-migration of men. This leaves women with an increased work-load at home, resulting in a feminization of responsibilities. Climate change is predicted <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> <b>frequency</b> and magnitude of natural hazards such as extreme heat.
