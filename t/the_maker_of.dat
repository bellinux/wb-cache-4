5|$|Richard was {{a sickly}} child and his parents' reduced {{circumstances}} meant that his education was somewhat sporadic. In {{his early years}} he wandered through the fields and brick yards where he lived, picking wildflowers. His favourites were Germander Speedwell, Creeping Tormentil and Common Chickweed. At {{the age of twelve}} he was apprenticed to a bat maker (<b>the</b> <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> children's small leather shoes) named James Heap, in Port Street, Manchester.

5|$|What {{this phrase}} meant to <b>the</b> <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> these riddles is {{impossible}} to say.

5|$|Based in Yokohama, Farsari {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with E. A. Sargent. Their firm, Sargent, Farsari & Co., dealt in smokers' supplies, stationery, visiting cards, newspapers, magazines and novels, Japanese and English conversation books, dictionaries, guidebooks, maps, and photographic views of Japan. The creator of these photographs remains unknown, but Farsari was <b>the</b> <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> {{at least some of}} the maps, notably of Miyanoshita (in the Hakone resort area) and Yokohama. After his partnership with Sargent ended, the company, now A. Farsari & Co., published successive editions of Keeling's Guide to Japan and Farsari himself wrote and published Japanese Words and Phrases for the Use of Strangers. The firm was among the most prolific publishers of materials to aid travellers, having produced its first guidebook to Japan by July 1880.|$|E
5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its social commentary. Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, <b>the</b> <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> the game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a terrorist act, and the game shines light on this as an indictment of the American dream and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E
5|$|Many {{events at}} the Queen's Hall were not {{presented}} by Newman. The hall was frequently let to organisations such as the Bach Choir and the Philharmonic Society (from 1903 the Royal Philharmonic Society), and later the London Choral Society and Royal Choral Society. The hall was used {{for a wide range}} of other activities, including balls, military band concerts under Sousa, lectures, public meetings, Morris dancing, Eurythmics and religious services. On 14 January 1896, the UK's first public film show was presented at the Queen's Hall to members and wives of the Royal Photographic Society by <b>the</b> <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> the Kineopticon and Fellow of the society, Birt Acres, and his colleague, Arthur Melbourne-Cooper.

5|$|Through a {{completely}} random encounter Cayce meets Voytek Biroshak and Ngemi, the former an artist using old ZX81 microcomputers as a sculpture medium, the latter a collector of rare technology (he mentions purchasing Stephen King's word processor, for example). Another collector, and sometime 'friend' of Ngemi's, Hobbs Baranov, {{is a retired}} cryptographer and mathematician with connections in the American National Security Agency. Cayce strikes a deal with him: she buys a Curta calculator for him and he finds the email address to which the watermark code was sent. Using this email address Cayce makes contact with Stella Volkova whose sister Nora is <b>the</b> <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> the film clips.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>maker</b> <b>of</b> {{the work}} is unknown; it is not signed or marked, and goldsmiths of the period rarely did this. There {{are a number of}} goldsmiths' names known from {{accounts}} and other records, but none of the few surviving works can be attached to a particular maker. Paris was the centre of production for the great numbers of joyaux, secular and religious, produced for the extended Valois royal family and other buyers. Berry and his brothers and nephews had goldsmiths on salaries or retainers for what must have been a continuous flow of commissions, whose results are tersely catalogued in various inventories of the period, but of which there are now only a handful of survivals. Only one item mentioned in the records of the Berry collection might match the reliquary, but this was made after 1401, which conflicts with the date suggested by the heraldry. Another possibility is that the reliquary was made and given as a gift, as many such pieces were, in between inventories.|$|E
