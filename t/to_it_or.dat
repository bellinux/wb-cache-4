5|$|The only {{objection}} is, {{not that}} the Court acted beyond its jurisdiction, but that it erred in its judgment of the law applicable to the case.

If this were an application for a habeas corpus, after judgment on an indictment for an offence within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, it could hardly be maintained, that this court could revise such a judgment, or the proceedings which led <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> set it aside, and discharge the prisoner.|$|E

25|$|Henry rejects materialism, which admits only {{matter as}} reality, because {{the manifestation of}} matter in the {{transcendence}} of the world always presupposes life's self-revelation, whether in order to accede <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> <b>or</b> {{to be able to}} see it or touch it. He equally rejects idealism, which reduces being to thought and is in principle incapable of grasping the reality of being which it reduces to an unreal image, to a simple representation. For Michel Henry, the revelation of the absolute resides in affectivity and is constituted by it.|$|E

Beret colors are also often indicative of the soldier's corps, although most non-combat corps do not have their own beret, and sometimes wear the color of the corps to which the post they're stationed in belongs.

25|$|Amtrak is {{no longer}} {{required}} by law to operate a national route system, but it is encouraged to do so. Amtrak has presence in 46 of the 48 contiguous states (lacking Wyoming and South Dakota). Amtrak services fall into three groups: short-haul service on the Northeast Corridor, state-supported short haul service outside the Northeast Corridor, and long-distance service known within Amtrak as the National Network. Amtrak receives federal funding {{for the vast majority of}} its operations including the central spine of the Northeast Corridor between Boston and Washington DC as well as for its National long distance routes. In addition to the federally funded routes, Amtrak partners with transportation agencies in 18 states to operate other short and medium haul routes outside of the Northeast Corridor, some of which connect <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> are extensions off of it. In addition to its inter-city services, Amtrak also operates commuter services for three state agencies including MARC in Maryland, Shore Line East in Connecticut, and Metrolink in California.|$|E
25|$|This {{notion of}} slow cooling {{implemented}} in the Simulated Annealing algorithm is interpreted as a slow decrease in the probability of accepting worse solutions as the solution space is explored. Accepting worse solutions is a fundamental property of metaheuristics because it allows for a more extensive search for the global optimal solution. In general, the Simulated Annealing algorithms work as follows. At each time step, the algorithm randomly selects a solution close to the current one, measures its quality, and then decides to move <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>or</b> {{to stay with the}} current solution based on either one of two probabilities between which it chooses {{on the basis of the}} fact that the new solution is better or worse than the current one. During the search, the temperature is progressively decreased from an initial positive value to zero and affects the two probabilities: at each step, the probability of moving to a better new solution is either kept to 1 or is changed towards a positive value; instead, the probability of moving to a worse new solution is progressively changed towards zero.|$|E
