5000|$|Downs Gulch Aerodrome , is {{a privately}} owned aerodrome located [...] north of Downs Gulch, New Brunswick, Canada. This aerodrome is near {{an area of}} the Restigouche River valley known for its good salmon fishing; consequently, many private and charter {{aircraft}} use this strip as a means of accessing nearby lodges in areas such as Larrys Gulch. There is no available parking for aircraft, only a wider <b>turn-around</b> <b>area</b> mid-runway, so all aircraft must depart after dropping off their passengers.|$|E
