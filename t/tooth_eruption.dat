5|$|<b>Tooth</b> <b>eruption</b> {{in humans}} {{is a process}} in tooth {{development}} in which the teeth enter the mouth and become visible. Current research indicates that the periodontal ligaments {{play an important role}} in <b>tooth</b> <b>eruption.</b> Primary teeth erupt into the mouth from around six months until two years of age. These teeth are the only ones in the mouth until a person is about six years old. At that time, the first permanent tooth erupts. This stage, during which a person has a combination of primary and permanent teeth, is known as the mixed stage. The mixed stage lasts until the last primary tooth is lost and the remaining permanent teeth erupt into the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{abnormalities}} may {{be categorized}} {{according to whether}} they have environmental or developmental causes. While environmental abnormalities may appear to have an obvious cause, there may {{not appear to be}} any known cause for some developmental abnormalities. Environmental forces may affect teeth during development, destroy tooth structure after development, discolor teeth at any stage of development, or alter the course of <b>tooth</b> <b>eruption.</b> Developmental abnormalities most commonly affect the number, size, shape, and structure of teeth.|$|E
5|$|<b>Tooth</b> <b>eruption</b> may {{be altered}} by some {{environmental}} factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth {{is said to}} be impacted. The most common cause of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth. Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. Tooth ankylosis occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.|$|E
40|$|Growth and {{development}} of the teeth are parts of growth {{and development}} of the body. It is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Prenatal environment might cause premature birth and disturbances of teeth development. The purpose of this research was to find out the time of deciduous <b>teeth</b> <b>eruption</b> in premature born children with low birth weight/LBW. This was a cross-sectional study, conducted in January to June 2009 in Dental Hospital Faculty of Dentistry Universitas Padjadjaran. Subjects were children aged 4 – 30 months with prematurely born low birth weight and normal birth weight as control. The technique was consecutive admissions; 49 prematurely born LBW children (gestational age 2, 500 grams). Deciduous <b>teeth</b> <b>eruption</b> was determinated by the number of erupted teeth. Linear corelation regression analysis and t- student test were used in this research. The results showed that there was a significant correlation between deciduous <b>teeth</b> <b>eruption</b> and age, (p< 0. 01) and deciduous <b>teeth</b> <b>eruption</b> in prematurely born children with LBW was significantly delayed (p< 0. 01). In conclusion, deciduous <b>teeth</b> <b>eruption</b> in prematurely born LBW children was significantly delayed...|$|R

5|$|Newborn {{children}} with hypothyroidism may have normal birth weight and height (although the head may {{be larger than}} expected and the posterior fontanelle may be open). Some may have drowsiness, decreased muscle tone, a hoarse-sounding cry, feeding difficulties, constipation, an enlarged tongue, umbilical hernia, dry skin, a decreased body temperature and jaundice. A goiter is rare, although it may develop later in children who have a thyroid gland that does not produce functioning thyroid hormone. A goiter may also develop in children growing up in areas with iodine deficiency. Normal growth and development may be delayed, and not treating infants may lead to an intellectual impairment (IQ 6–15 points lower in severe cases). Other problems include the following: large scale and fine motor skills and coordination, reduced muscle tone, squinting, decreased attention span, and delayed speaking. <b>Tooth</b> <b>eruption</b> may be delayed.|$|E

Full and Mosaic karyotype in Down’s Syndrome (DS) patients have different prognostics. A total of 33 DS patients constituted of 23 full and 10 mosaics were enrolled in this cross sectional study. The Chi-square statistical test was utilized to analyze the data. The result revealed that a full trisomy DS patients had their deciduous teeth erupted in 13 - 18 months old while a mosaic DS patients in 8 - 12 months old.

50|$|Based on <b>teeth</b> <b>eruption</b> pattern, the {{researchers}} think that H. antecessor {{had the same}} development stages as H. sapiens, though probably at a faster pace. Other significant features demonstrated by the species are a protruding occipital bun, a low forehead, {{and a lack of}} a strong chin. Some of the remains are almost indistinguishable from the fossil attributable to the 1.5-million-year-old Turkana Boy, belonging to H. ergaster.|$|R

25|$|Although <b>tooth</b> <b>eruption</b> {{occurs at}} {{different}} times for different people, a general eruption timeline exists. Typically, humans have 20 primary (baby) teeth and 32 permanent teeth. <b>Tooth</b> <b>eruption</b> has three stages. The first, known as deciduous dentition stage, occurs when only primary teeth are visible. Once the first permanent tooth erupts into the mouth, the teeth are in the mixed (or transitional) dentition. After the last primary tooth falls out of the mouth—a process known as exfoliation—the teeth are in the permanent dentition.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the plaque}} {{stagnation}} area is removed either through further complete <b>tooth</b> <b>eruption</b> or tooth removal then pericoronitis will likely never return. A non-impacted tooth {{may continue to}} erupt, reaching a position which eliminates the operculum. A transient and mild pericoronal inflammation often continues while this <b>tooth</b> <b>eruption</b> completes. With adequate space for sustained improved oral hygiene methods, pericoronitis may never return. However, when relying on just oral hygiene for impacted and partially erupted teeth, chronic pericoronitis with occasional acute exacerbation can be expected.|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to find the {{relation}} between local and systemic manifestations during primary <b>teeth</b> <b>eruption</b> in the region of Tunis, Tunisia. Materials And Methods: A cross sectional descriptive study involving 300 children aged from 6 months to 6 years was conducted. Questionnaires were distributed to all mothers and were used to inquire on the local and systemic symptoms associated with teething and measures used to decrease signs and pain they described. Data entry and analysis were done using an SPSS program version 23. 0. Results: Teething symptoms were reported in 90. 3 % (271 / 300) of the children. The most common findings were Fever (60. 7 %) and drooling (57 %), the least common symptom observed in the study was jugal erythema (16 %). 42 % of mothers took some action to resolve teething symptoms. Giving an object to chew (32. 7 %) was the most common method used. Conclusion: Many local and systemic symptoms were found during primary <b>teeth</b> <b>eruption.</b> Most manifestations were found during eruption of the primary incisors...|$|R

40|$|Individuals with {{skeletal}} discrepancy {{often come}} when growing {{is no longer}} expectable. This may occur due to the "myth" saying that the best timing for orthodontic treatment is to wait until all permanent <b>teeth</b> <b>eruption</b> (except the wisdom teeth) or {{to wait until the}} age of 12. With better nutrition, perhaps, nowadays, adolescents mature much earlier. Sometimes, 2 - 3 years before the age of 12, all deciduous dentition has been exfoliated. Thus, when orthodontic treatment started at this age, not much growth modification can be applied since not much growth can be expected. This often leads to a more difficult and complex orthodontic treatment. It is wise to pay attention early and treat it if necessary, when discrepancy is detected, due to prevent further facial and dental deformity. Skills in establishing a proper diagnosis and treatment plan and determining the time when to start an orthodontic treatment are essential. It is also necessary to recognize the puberty signs in regards to apply the optimal growth potential for growing patients. Timing the individual permanent <b>teeth</b> <b>eruption,</b> the completion of root formation also factors to be thoroughly considered when treatment needs to be commenced in the mixed dentition stage...|$|R

25|$|Pericoronitis {{is caused}} by an {{accumulation}} of bacteria and debris beneath the operculum, or by mechanical trauma (e.g. biting the operculum with the opposing tooth). Pericoronitis {{is often associated with}} partially erupted and impacted mandibular third molars (lower wisdom teeth), often occurring at the age of wisdom <b>tooth</b> <b>eruption</b> (15-24). Other common causes of similar pain from the third molar region are food impaction causing periodontal pain, pulpitis from dental caries (tooth decay), and acute myofascial pain in temporomandibular joint disorder.|$|E
25|$|RANKL is {{a member}} of the tumour {{necrosis}} family (TNF), and is essential in osteoclastogenesis. RANKL knockout mice exhibit a phenotype of osteopetrosis and defects of <b>tooth</b> <b>eruption,</b> along with an absence or deficiency of osteoclasts. RANKL activates NF-κβ (nuclear factor-κβ) and NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated t cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 1) through RANK. NF-κβ activation is stimulated almost immediately after RANKL-RANK interaction occurs and is not upregulated. NFATc1 stimulation, however, begins ~24–48 hours after binding occurs and its expression has been shown to be RANKL dependent.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} case of a teenage boy with a Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome. There are only few recent {{publications}} on the topic of Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome in medical literature. This syndrome appears with a same frequency in both sexes. The disease prevalence is still unknown due to many undiagnosed cases linked with high mortality in early childhood. There are no prenatal screening for this disease till now, but it is clear, that in case of positive diagnostic tests, abortion should be recommended. The typical clinical symptoms of Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome are the following: physical development delay, loss of subcutaneous fat, teeth and nails abnormalities (premature <b>teeth</b> <b>eruption,</b> <b>teeth</b> number doubling, nails thickening). The earliest signs of the syndrome are skin hyperpigmentation and hyperkeratosis at neck, armpits and groin, which are typical for insulin resistance. Children with Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome usually have early manifestation of diabetes mellitus, characterized by labile disease course and frequent ketoacidosis state.

25|$|Wisdom teeth become {{impacted}} {{when there}} is not enough room in the jaws to allow for all of the teeth to erupt into the mouth. Because the wisdom teeth are the last to erupt, due to insufficient room in the jaws to accommodate more teeth, the wisdom teeth become stuck in the jaws, i.e., impacted. There is a genetic predisposition to tooth impaction. Genetics plays an important, albeit unpredictable role in dictating jaw and tooth size and <b>tooth</b> <b>eruption</b> potential of the teeth. Some also believe that there is an evolutionary decrease in jaw size due to softer modern diets that are more refined and less coarse than our ancestors'.|$|E

25|$|Normally {{metabolizing}} {{tooth root}} cells have an internal cell pressure (osmolality) of 280-300 mOs and a pH of 7.2. When {{there is an}} uninterrupted blood supply, all of the metabolites (calcium, phosphate, potassium) and glucose that the cells require are provided. When the tooth is knocked-out, this normal blood supply is cut off and within 15 minutes most of the stored metabolites have been depleted and the cells will begin to die. Within one to two hours, enough cells will die that rejection of the tooth by the body {{at a later time}} is the usual outcome. The method by which the body rejects the replanted tooth is a process called “replacement root resorption”. During this process, the tooth root cells become necrotic (dead) and will activate the immunologic mechanism of the body to attempt to remove this necrotic layer and literally eats away the tooth root. This is called “root resorption” It is a slow, but non-painful, process that is sometimes not observed by x-rays for years. Once this process starts, it is irreversible and the tooth will eventually fall out. In growing children, this can cause bone development problems because the replacement resorption (also termed ankylosis) attaches the tooth firmly to the jaw bone and stops normal <b>tooth</b> <b>eruption</b> and impedes normal jaw growth.|$|E
