50|$|Roller-delayed {{blowback}} {{was first}} used in Mauser's StG 45(M) and MG 45 prototypes. Roller-delayed blowback operation differs from roller-locked recoil operation {{as seen in the}} MG 42. Unlike the MG 42, in roller-delayed blowback the barrel is fixed and does not recoil. As the bolt head is driven rearward, rollers {{on the sides of the}} bolt are driven inward against a <b>tapered</b> <b>bolt</b> carrier extension. This forces the bolt carrier rearward at a much greater velocity and delays movement of the bolt head. The primary advantage of roller-delayed blowback is the simplicity of the design compared to gas or recoil operation.|$|R
50|$|The company {{became very}} widely known after the Tay Bridge {{disaster}} of 28 December 1879, {{when they were}} commissioned to photograph {{the remains of the}} bridge for the Court of Inquiry. They recorded over 50 high quality photographs of the debris, and they were used in the court to help witnesses when giving testimony. The pictures were subsequently sold across the country, and used in picture postcards. In 2003 they were re-analysed using digital methods to show how and why the bridge collapsed in so spectacular a fashion. The enlargements show numerous defects, especially <b>tapered</b> <b>bolt</b> holes on the critical connections holding the tie bars and struts to the cast iron columns. Failure occurred from these brittle cast iron lugs, and initiated the disaster. Other defects included lack of strengthening girders at the tops of the piers in the high girders section. It was this part of the bridge which was almost completely demolished during the disaster.|$|R
40|$|In a bolted joint, it {{is known}} that {{failures}} usually happen {{at the root of the}} first bolt thread where the maximum stress concentration occurs. Previously several methods were proposed to reduce the stress concentration through improving bolts and nuts profile. Among those methods, tapering threads have been widely used in mechanical structures. Those types of threads are called CD bolts, which were proposed by Nishida as an effective method for stress reduction. Several experimental studies indicated that CD bolts have higher fatigue strength although little FEM analyses is available. In this study, therefore, the <b>bolted</b> joint with <b>tapered</b> threads is analyzed with the finite element method, and stress reduction effect of CD bolts is discussed with varying geometrical conditions. The reduction of the stress concentration is realized by <b>tapering</b> <b>bolt</b> thread. Then, it is found that the stress reduction is notable when the height of bolt threads is reduced significantly near the bolt heat and the nut is closer to the bolt head. According to those results, optimum conditions for stress reduction are discussed. Then, it is shown that the maximum stress can be decreased by 20 % compared with the cases of standard bolts and nuts...|$|R
5000|$|In common usage, the {{distinction}} (not rigorous) is often that screws {{are smaller than}} bolts, and that screws are generally <b>tapered</b> while <b>bolts</b> are not. For example, cylinder head bolts are called [...] "bolts" [...] (at least in North American usage) {{despite the fact that}} by some definitions they ought to be called [...] "screws". Their size and their similarity to a bolt that would take a nut seem linguistically to overrule any other factors in this natural word choice proclivity.|$|R
50|$|One {{of the few}} {{engines to}} use {{undercut}} crankshafts was the Bugatti U-16 aircraft engine, a typical Bugatti approach, where only their unlimited budget and attention to detail could afford such complexities. The U-16 engine also had each 8-cylinder crankshaft built as two 4-cylinder crankshafts, assembled by a <b>bolted</b> <b>taper</b> joint. This joint may be seen at the left-hand side of the close-up drawing.|$|R
40|$|Previously several {{methods were}} {{proposed}} {{to reduce the}} stress concentration through improving bolts and nuts profile. Among those methods, (1) <b>Tapering</b> thread <b>bolt</b> (CD bolt) were proposed for stress reduction and (2) Special nuts were designed to have slightly different pitches. In this paper, a kind of nut is designed with providing slightly different pitches between the CD bolt and nut, so that the prevailing torque is appearing {{in order to obtain}} the anti-loosening and stress reduction effects. It is found that the maximum static stress concentration can be decreased by 28. 6 %, and the maximum stress amplitude can be decreased by 23. 9 % compared with the cases of standard bolts and nuts...|$|R
25|$|Set {{off from}} the main {{building}} by approximately 13 metres to the north-west and south-east are two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating that faces both tracks. Four steel T-shaped components support steel perforated purlins, which inturn support the corrugated metal roof sheeting. The former divide the seating lengths. Set about {{four and a half}} metres apart, they are made with two cantilevered, <b>tapering</b> I-beams <b>bolted</b> to a rectangular hollow steel column (made with two C-sections welded together) which is founded in a concrete upstand. A perpendicular upstand runs the length of the shelter along the midline. Welded to the steel columns and beams are lighter steel frames. The infill panels of glass have been removed, as have some of the steel ones, while others are corroded. The seating is made with painted timber slats supported on timber studs and some steel framing. The downpipes taking water from the box gutter continue the rhythm of the columns, piercing the timber caps that join the two sides of seating at the centre of each gap.|$|R
25|$|The main {{building}} at Graceville had a butterfly roof formed with a reinforced concrete slab lined with bituminous felt and supported on ten pre-cast, reinforced concrete beams that cantilevered off a continuous lintel resting on ten brick piers. A range of materials {{were used to}} fill the gaps between the brick frame: including orange-coloured face brick, screened openings, some small sections of render and various aluminium-framed windows. On either side of this building, two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating were erected. Each {{was made up of}} four sets of steel columns and cantilevered steel <b>tapering</b> I-beams <b>bolted</b> together. The seating, made with timber slats and a steel and timber frame, was placed back-to- back facing each track. Dividing each row of seating were metal ribbed screens. Fitted to each steel column and under each beam were panels framed in steel and filled with glass above the seat level and sheet steel below. The other narrower platform necessitated smaller butterfly-roofed awnings be built there. They were essentially the same construction as the larger ones with only three bays, two of which were given over to seating. The subway system with its street ramps and stairs to both platforms was constructed with reinforced concrete.|$|R
40|$|Stress {{relaxation}} and creep are major concerns when loading composite materials. Due to the viscoelactic {{nature of the}} matrix material, composite materials tend to lose initial loads at a decreasing rate. This is especially true through {{the thickness of the}} material, where the behavior of the material is dominated by the matrix. Of particular interest to the current study presented in this thesis is the investigation of stress relaxation in bolted composite/metal hybrid connections. It is ultimately desired {{to be able to use}} bolted composite/metal hybrid connections for naval applications, where it is important to maintain as much of the initial preload in the connection as possible in order to maintain watertight integrity. In order to quantify the stress relaxation in bolted hybrid connections, it was decided to study the connections at a sub-component level. Several different effects were studied in the connections, including reloading effects, possible advantages of using <b>tapered</b> head <b>bolts,</b> and environmental effects. All tests were run for a time period of at least 3 -month in order to get an estimate of long-term stress relaxation effects in the bolted connections. Test results showed that the load curves could be fit to a power law equation using the method of least squares...|$|R
