50|$|Prior to cooking, {{the spices}} are rinsed from the meat, {{which is then}} patted dry. The meat is placed in a cooking dish deep enough to contain the meat and <b>the</b> <b>rendered</b> <b>fat,</b> and placed in an oven at a low {{temperature}} (76 - 135 degrees Celsius/170 - 275 Fahrenheit). The meat is slowly poached at least until cooked, or until meltingly tender, generally four to ten hours.|$|R
50|$|Overhead heat has the {{advantage}} of allowing foods containing fats, such as steaks, chops and other cuts of meat, to be grilled without the risk of flare-ups caused by <b>the</b> <b>rendered</b> <b>fat</b> dripping onto <b>the</b> heat source. The salamander's facility for extremely high temperature also takes less cooking time than other grilling techniques, reducing preparation time, which is a benefit in professional kitchens during a busy meal service.|$|R
5000|$|Basics: The {{mixture is}} simmered gently over low heat, and stirred often to prevent {{scorching}} {{until all the}} liquid is cooked off and the mixture is thick. It is then allowed to cool, then stirred again to incorporate all <b>the</b> <b>rendered</b> <b>fat,</b> and transferred to a large clean container or individual containers, covered tightly and refrigerated for several hours or overnight until firm. Pig marrow is also often added in order to form a gelatin that allows it to congeal.|$|R

40|$|This article explores a historiographic irony: in {{the early}} modern period, those who doubted the reality of witches’ flight posited an {{ointment}} of soporific herbs (especially nightshades) to explain witches’ flight: with transvection thus explained away as the effect of phytochemicals, alleged witches must be innocent. In contrast, those who believed in the real crime of witchcraft insisted that the devil caused bodily flight, while the ointment (composed of <b>the</b> <b>rendered</b> <b>fat</b> of murdered babies), provided a concrete symbol of their depravity. In contemporary (20 th- 21 st century) historiography, these positions are reversed. Most historians treat the ointment as an elite slander, while {{many of those who}} wish to assert the reality of the practice of witchcraft turn to the ointment as a scientifically explicable hallucinogenic “trip. ” After demonstrating that we have no evidence that any accused witch ever used a hallucinogenic ointment, the article reflects on the continued deployment of this trope to defend reductionist models of history and of human agency...|$|R

40|$|Objective In {{order to}} utilize fat from broiler {{byproducts}} efficiently, {{it is necessary}} to develop an appropriate rendering procedure and establish quality information for <b>the</b> <b>rendered</b> <b>fat.</b> A study was therefore undertaken to evaluate <b>the</b> influence of <b>rendering</b> methods on <b>the</b> amounts and general properties of the fat recovered from broiler skin. Methods The yield and quality of <b>the</b> broiler skin <b>fat</b> <b>rendered</b> through high and lower energy microwave rendering (3. 6 W/g for 10 min and 2. 4 W/g for 10 min for high power microwave rendering (HPMR) and high power microwave rendering (LPMR), respectively), oven baking (OB, at 180 °C for 40 min), and water cooking (WC, boiling for 40 min) were compared. Results Microwave-rendered skin exhibited the highest yields and fat recovery rates, followed by OB, and WC fats (p< 0. 05). HPMR fat had the highest L*, a*, and b* values, whereas WC fat had the highest moisture content, acid values, and thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values (p< 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference in}} the acid value, peroxide value, and TBA values between HPMR and LPMR <b>fats.</b> Conclusion Microwave <b>rendering</b> at a power level of 3. 6 W/g for 10 min is suggested base on the yield and quality of chicken fat...|$|R

50|$|Lard may be {{rendered}} by either of two processes: wet or dry. In wet <b>rendering,</b> pig <b>fat</b> is {{boiled in water}} or steamed at a high temperature and the lard, which is insoluble in water, is skimmed off {{the surface of the}} mixture or separated in an industrial centrifuge. In dry <b>rendering,</b> <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> is exposed to high heat in a pan or oven without the presence of water (a process similar to frying bacon). The two processes yield somewhat differing products. Wet-rendered lard has a more neutral flavor, a lighter color, and a high smoke point. Dry-rendered lard is somewhat more browned in color and flavor and has a lower smoke point. Rendered lard produces an unpleasant smell when mixed with oxygen.|$|R
5|$|Stock ducks {{would be}} chosen from ducklings hatched in March, with a typical breeder keeping six males and twenty laying females {{at any given}} time. The females would be kept for around a year before mating, {{typically}} to an older male. They would then generally be replaced, to reduce the problems of inbreeding. Stock ducks were allowed to roam freely during the day, and would swim in local ponds which, although privately owned, were treated as common property among the duck breeders; breeders would label their ducks with markings on the neck or head. The stock ducks would forage for greenery and insects, supplemented by greaves (the residue left after <b>the</b> <b>rendering</b> of animal <b>fat).</b> As ducks lay their eggs at night, the ducks would be brought indoors overnight.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{addition}} of adipose tissue, <b>rendered</b> <b>fat,</b> <b>rendered</b> <b>fat</b> + <b>the</b> separated connective tissue and <b>rendered</b> <b>fat</b> + gelatin, respectively, were compared on the fat-holding properties of hamburgers upon heating. The fat losses on frying (175 °C, 3. 5 {{minutes on each}} side) were substantially less than in the net test (cooking in a water bath at 77 oc for 35 minutes, followed by a centrifugation step). Fat losses during frying were governed both by the instability of the fat and the migration of the fat out of the product. The fat losses determined by the net test, however, reflected only the instability of the fat, as {{the effect of the}} migration of the fat out of the product was minimized, due to the centrifugation step. Fat-holding on frying was the best when fat was added in the form of fat cells and when an increased amount of connective tissue was added. On the contrary, fat-holding in the net test was be. st, when the fat was emulsified to smaller droplets with gelatin as an emulsifier. These observations suggest that the migration of the fat out of the hamburger is the most important factor, governing fat-holding in hamburgers on frying, whereas for the net test the instability of the fat per se seemed to be more essential...|$|R

40|$|Biodiesel is a fuel {{consisting}} of the alkyl monoesters of fatty acids from vegetable oils or animal fats. Biodiesel is receiving increasing attention as an alternative, non-toxic, biodegradable and renewable diesel fuel. Many {{studies have shown that}} the properties of biodiesel are very close to diesel fuel. Therefore, biodiesel can be used in diesel engines with little or no modification.;Biodiesel is usually produced from food-grade vegetable oils that are more expensive than diesel fuel. Therefore, use of biodiesel produced from food-grade vegetable oil may be limited to cases of severe shortages or emergencies. However, lower cost feedstocks are available. <b>Rendered</b> animal <b>fats</b> and restaurant waste oils are an attractive source to produce biodiesel. The problem with processing <b>rendered</b> <b>fats</b> and oils is that they usually contain large amounts of free fatty acids that cannot be converted to biodiesel using an alkaline catalyst due to the formation of soaps. An alternative way is to use acid catalysts, which are more tolerant of free fatty acids.;The objective of this study was to develop a process to utilize <b>rendered</b> <b>fats,</b> known as yellow grease, as a biodiesel feedstock and to build a pilot plant to implement this process. The pilot plant was successfully constructed and was shown to be capable of processing <b>rendered</b> <b>fats</b> containing 40 % free fatty acids.;After preparing a sufficient amount of biodiesel from <b>rendered</b> animal <b>fats</b> and restaurant waste oils, the impact of the biodiesel on diesel engine exhaust emissions and engine performance was evaluated and compared to No. 2 diesel fuel and soybean oil methyl ester.

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that fats and oils develop rancidity when exposed to the air. Atmospheric oxygen attacks the {{unsaturated}} triglyceride molecules with the formation of many oxidation products, among which peroxidic and carbonyl compounds are the most important. This deterioration of the fat results in the production of off-flavours and odours which <b>render</b> <b>the</b> <b>fat</b> unpalatable. Many chemical tests have been employed for the detection of rancidity which depend on the presence of these compounds. Recently a very sensitive method has been developed based on the oxidation of ferrous iron to ferric by the peroxides present in an oxidized fat. The ferric ion produced is determined colorimetrically as ferric thiocyanate. This method has recently been severely criticized by Lea, who stated that the method was subject to serious error owing to the interference of atmospheric oxygen. The presence of air in the reaction mixture has also resulted in high peroxide values of fats and oils when determined by other modifications of the ferrous salt method.
