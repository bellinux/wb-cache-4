5|$|Though Sam Manekshaw was conferred {{the rank}} of field marshal in 1973, it was {{reported}} that he was never given the complete allowances he was entitled to as a field marshal. It was not until President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam took the initiative when he met Manekshaw in Wellington, and made sure that the field marshal was presented with a cheque for Rs 1.3 crores–his arrears of pay for over 30 years. Even more surprisingly, Manekshaw's funeral was not attended by the <b>top</b> <b>brass</b> from civil, military, or political leadership.|$|E

For technical reasons (distance of communication with bases) and because new places of historical interest were accessible, the <b>top</b> <b>brass</b> debated whether to transfer the postings of new recruits at Massada to a more appropriate place.

5000|$|N.B. Palmer {{was named}} after explorer, sailing captain, and ship {{designer}} Nathaniel Palmer. Along with the Sweepstakes, she {{was perhaps the most}} famous clipper built in New York's Westervelt yard. In China N.B.

A full-rigged model of the N.B. Palmer was exhibited at The Crystal Palace, London, in 1851, and attracted much attention as a fine example of the American clipper ship.|$|R

Bischoff, originally brought in as a secondary commentator behind Jim Ross after the AWA folded, was desperate to give WCW a new direction and impressed Turner's <b>top</b> <b>brass</b> with his non-confrontational tactics and business savvy.

25|$|Another factor {{prompting}} motorization was {{the decline}} of national horse stocks and the inability to restore them in reasonable time. Of all the major powers, only the United Kingdom, weakened {{by the loss of}} Ireland, was in part compelled to motorize for this reason; horse stocks in Germany, the United States and the Soviet Union remained sufficient for at least their peacetime armies. In 1928 the United Kingdom became the first nation to begin the replacement of horse cavalry with motorized troops and by 1939 had become the first to motorize their national army, although some Yeomanry regiments plus regular cavalry units serving overseas remained mounted. British experimental armored units had performed impressively since 1926, but, facing resistance from the traditional branches of service, remained unpopular among <b>top</b> <b>brass</b> until the Battle of France.|$|E
25|$|On August 28, 1943, Stanley Lovell {{was asked}} to make a {{presentation}} {{in front of a}} not very friendly audience of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, since the U.S. <b>top</b> <b>brass</b> were largely skeptical of all OSS plans beyond collecting military intelligence and were ready to split the OSS between the Army and the Navy. While explaining the purpose and mission of his department and introducing various gadgets and tools, he reportedly casually dropped into a waste basket a Hedy, a panic-inducing explosive device {{in the shape of a}} firecracker, which shortly produced a loud shrieking sound followed by a deafening boom. The presentation was interrupted and did not resume since everyone in the room fled.

In a thesis written by Pervez Cheema, the 1971 war was fought [...] "without a purpose and with total lack of coordination between the civil effort and the armed forces, and between four fighting services: the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Marines." [...] Furthermore, the federal studies also noted that the <b>top</b> military <b>brass</b> had alienated the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the Marines in which, none weren't taken in confidence, and the joint efforts were unsupported at either a planning or operational level, and were also constrained over disagreements during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.
