25|$|Peru is {{investigating}} claims that a beauty pageant contestant was lured to Gabon {{to become the}} lover of its 67-year-old president, Omar Bongo, and was stranded for nearly two weeks after she refused. A spokesman for Mr. Bongo said {{he was unaware of}} the allegations. The Peruvian Foreign Ministry said that Ivette Santa Maria, a 22-year-old Miss Peru America contestant, was invited to Gabon to be a hostess for a pageant there. In an interview, Ms. Santa Maria said that she was taken to Mr. Bongo's presidential palace hours after her Jan. 19 arrival and that as he joined her, he pressed a button and some sliding doors opened, revealing a large bed. She said, I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> was not a prostitute, that I was a Miss Peru. She fled and guards offered to drive her to a hotel. Without money to pay the bill, however, she was stranded in Gabon for 12 days until international women's groups and others intervened.|$|E

500|$|During {{the snake}} {{handling}} {{scene at the}} Church of God with Signs and Wonders, the song being sung by the congregation is called [...] "May Glory Protect Us". The song was written by executive producer Paul Rabwin, who was heavily involved in the episode's music production. Rabwin later noted, [...] "I auditioned a bunch of gospel songs [...] I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> could write one that was better {{and he told me}} to go for it. And I did. [...] Kim loved it. [...] It was a great tribute {{that he was able to}} ask me and accept my opinion on it." ...|$|E
500|$|Dylan first {{performed}} [...] "Visions of Johanna" [...] {{in public}} on December 4, 1965, at the Berkeley Community Theatre. Present at this concert was Joan Baez, who believed the lyrics referred to her. She said, [...] "He'd just written 'Visions of Johanna', which sounded very suspicious to me...he'd never performed it before and Neuwirth <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> {{was there that}} night and he performed it." [...] Heylin suggests that if Dylan performed it for anyone that night it was Allen Ginsberg, who was also present. Heylin argues Dylan considered Ginsberg {{to be an important}} influence on his songwriting at this juncture, and was keen to showcase the song for the Beat poet.|$|E
500|$|Carradine {{formed an}} acting company {{that he called}} Kansas Flyer', a metaphor for a check that bounces." [...] He {{acquired}} a broken-down carousel in a junk yard in Los Angeles, and some broken horses in Kansas City. He and his entourage then headed for Drury, Kansas. The original working title of the film was Around. While exploring film title designs for the picture, Carradine came across a style called Americana. [...] "I {{was trying to figure}} out what it would look like if it said Around. Suddenly, I said to myself, 'Why am I doing this, anyway? It's right here in front of me.' I called up the title designer and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> was changing the title to Americana." ...|$|E

But he would take no answer but the one; and I did--I did give it <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> know I did; and I have never had a moment of happiness since. And now has come this letter. Janet, do not be cruel to me. Do not speak to me as though everything must be stern and hard and cruel." [...] Then she handed up the letter, and Mrs. Fenwick read it as they walked.|$|R

500|$|Joining the Maple Leafs for the 1929–30 season, 18-year-old Jackson was the {{youngest}} player in the National Hockey League (NHL). In his league debut, against the Montreal Canadiens, Jackson knocked over his idol Howie Morenz with a bodycheck. [...] Assessing the youngster's potential following the hit, Morenz offered, [...] "you'll do". Jackson appeared in 31 games for the Maple Leafs, scoring 12 goals and adding 6 assists. He missed some time due to injury, during which he earned his nickname from the team's trainer, Tim Daly. According to Jackson: [...] "Daly asked me to carry sticks for him. [...] I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> wasn't a stick boy, I was a hockey player. So he said I {{was nothing but a}} fresh busher [...] and the name stuck." ...|$|E
500|$|Seward's wife Frances {{was deeply}} {{committed}} to the abolitionist movement. In the 1850s, the Seward family opened their Auburn home as a safehouse to fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad. Seward's frequent travel and political work suggest that it was Frances who played the {{more active role in}} Auburn abolitionist activities. In the excitement following the rescue and safe transport of fugitive slave William [...] "Jerry" [...] Henry in Syracuse on October 1, 1851, Frances wrote to her husband, [...] "two fugitives have gone to Canada—one of them our acquaintance John." [...] Another time she wrote, [...] "A {{man by the name of}} William Johnson will apply to you for assistance to purchase the freedom of his daughter. You will see that I have given him something by his book. I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> thought you would give him more." ...|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, Fellini {{drew his}} three leading players from people {{associated}} with the 1954 film Donne Proibite (Angels of Darkness), directed by Giuseppe Amato, in which Masina played the very different role of a madam. Anthony Quinn was also acting in the film, while Richard Basehart was often on the set visiting his wife, actress Valentina Cortese. When Masina introduced Quinn to her husband, the actor was disconcerted by Fellini's insistence that the director had found his Zampanò, later remembering: [...] "I {{thought he was a}} little bit crazy, and I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> wasn't interested in the picture, but he kept hounding me for days." [...] Not long afterwards, Quinn spent the evening with Roberto Rossellini and Ingrid Bergman, and after dinner they watched Fellini's 1953 Italian comedy-drama I Vitelloni. According to Quinn: [...] "I was thunderstruck by it. I told them the film was a masterpiece, and that the same director was the man who had been chasing me for weeks." ...|$|E

500|$|A similar, {{although}} more indepth, {{story of the}} recruitment of Gholston has been told by Wilcher: [...] "He {{was walking down the}} hall with a Bible in his hands," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "He was already built like a grown man; he was all cut up (like a bodybuilder). I asked him, 'Can I help you sir?' He looked around to see who I was talking to. I said, 'Are you looking for a student?' He said, 'No, I go here.' He said he was a freshman. I thought he was lying." [...] When the defensive coordinator kicked Gholston off the team for being too soft, Wilcher went to his house and dragged him back into the program: [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> didn't care if he wasn't tough enough, he was going to play football for me," [...] Wilcher said. [...] "I knew that he had desire to play. My only regret is that I didn't put him at running back. I didn't know how fast he was." ...|$|E
500|$|The actress also {{recounted the}} story to Alan Mercer of Dazzling Diva.com, saying: [...] "I told them I don't want any more money. I just want to direct one episode {{in the next two}} year cycle. I didn't think that was so horrible. I didn't want to direct six episodes. They still said no. Basically, I was fired at the end of year eight. So, I said good-bye, and Larry said 'see you next season.' I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> won't be coming back. He said, [...] "What!?!" [...] I told him, [...] "They fired me because I want to direct one episode, and if that's their stance, I'm out of here." [...] He was stunned and he said if you go I go. He denies that to this day. He really went to bat for me." [...] Gray {{remained}} a member of the principal cast until she left the show in its twelfth season. Her departure came as a surprise, but her publicist said that after eleven years on the show, she wished to pursue other things.|$|E
500|$|Ashley Michelle Tisdale {{was born}} in Monmouth County, New Jersey, on July 2, 1985, to Lisa Morris and {{contractor}} Michael Tisdale. Her father is Christian and her mother is Jewish; she was raised with [...] "a little bit of both" [...] religions. Tisdale's elder sister Jennifer is an actress and producer. She is also related to businessman Ron Popeil through her maternal grandfather Arnold Morris who was best known for being a pitchman for the Ginsu knife. At the age of three, Tisdale met her manager, Bill Perlman, at a New Jersey mall. He sent her to various auditions for commercials, and she was placed {{in more than one}} hundred national network TV advertisements as a child. She began her theatrical career by appearing in [...] and The Sound of Music at Monmouth County's Jewish Community Center. Tisdale was eight years old when she was cast to play the part of Cosette in the musical Les Misérables, and only recalled taking a single singing lesson before landing the role. In 2007, Tisdale told Newsday, [...] "When I was little, I saw the play Les Misérables on Broadway. [...] I thought it was the most amazing thing I have ever seen, so I went to my manager and <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> wanted to be in it". Tisdale toured for two years with Les Misérables before landing a role in a touring production of Annie in Korea.|$|E

500|$|After {{completing}} The Elephant Man (1980), Lynch met producer Richard Roth over coffee. Roth {{had read}} and enjoyed Lynch's Ronnie Rocket script, {{but did not}} think it was something he wanted to produce. He asked Lynch if the filmmaker had any other scripts, but the director only had ideas. [...] "I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> <b>I</b> had always wanted to sneak into a girl's room to watch her into the night and that, maybe, at one point or another, I would see something that would be the clue to a murder mystery. Roth loved the idea and asked me to write a treatment. I went home and thought of the ear in the field." [...] Production was announced in August 1984. Lynch wrote two more drafts before he was satisfied with the script of the film. Conditions at this point were ideal for Lynch's film: he had made a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that gave him complete artistic freedom and final cut privileges, with the stipulation that the filmmaker take a cut in his salary and work with a budget of only $6 million. This deal meant that Blue Velvet was the smallest film on the De Laurentiis' slate. Consequently, Lynch would be left mostly unsupervised during production. [...] "After Dune I was down so far that anything was up! So it was just a euphoria. And when you work with that kind of feeling, you can take chances. You can experiment." [...] Because the material was completely different from anything that would be considered mainstream at the time, Laurentiis had to start his own company to distribute it.|$|E
