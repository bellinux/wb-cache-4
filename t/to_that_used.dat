5|$|In {{southern}} Italy and southwestern Spain, the {{snakelocks anemone}} (Anemonia viridis) is consumed as a delicacy. The whole animal is marinated in vinegar, then coated in a batter similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> to make calamari and deep-fried in olive oil.|$|E

5|$|According to the 1995 presidential decree, the {{national}} flag {{is to be}} used on a staff that is colored gold (ochre). Other parts of the protocol specify the finial (the metal ornament on a flag pole) as diamond-shaped and colored in a yellow metal. In this diamond there is a five-pointed star (similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> in national emblem). The diamond-pattern represents another continuation of Soviet flag-traditions.|$|E
5|$|At a waterfall, {{another girl}} commits suicide by drowning. The girl, Carlin, looks {{identical}} to Lauren. Andrews performs an autopsy on Carlin as well, finding the same astrological symbol. It also {{becomes clear that}} the two girls are related—identical twins, born seven years apart. The girls are clones, produced using a technique similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> to create identical cattle. Black believes that this is connected to Hoffman's Earth Changes theory, that someone is breeding offspring destined to survive May 5, 2000.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 17, Page {{moved to}} Hollywood to further {{employment}} in acting. He gained minor roles on soap operas, including General Hospital. He took coursework at the Art Center College of Design, and in 1989 for a class on product-design he created a machine apparatus similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> by the character portrayed by Sigourney Weaver in the film Aliens. He received his degree in industrial design from that institution with honors in 1990. Following his graduation, Page instructed students at the Switzerland location of the Art Center College of Design. Along with his studio partner Scott Robertson, he began {{work in the field}} of design consulting.|$|E
5|$|Full-scale armour trials {{revealed}} serious {{weaknesses in}} the proposed protection scheme. The trials employed the obsolete ironclad , modified with armour protection identical <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> by the s then under construction. The deck and turret roof armour proved to be too thin, and the structure supporting the side armour was {{not strong enough to}} withstand the shock of impact from heavy shells.|$|E
5|$|Gunnerkrigg Court {{is set in}} a {{boarding}} school in a country that resembles the United Kingdom, identifiable from the grey skies and mandatory uniforms. The comic contains other clues about the setting, such as the house system that is described {{at the end of the}} first chapter. This system is similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> by many UK schools, including the one the author attended; Siddell has even stated that the school in which Gunnerkrigg Court takes place is modeled after his own secondary school.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{horses are}} often used to reenact many of their {{historical}} work purposes. Horses are used, complete with equipment that is authentic or a meticulously recreated replica, in various live action historical reenactments of specific periods of history, especially recreations of famous battles. Horses are also used to preserve cultural traditions and for ceremonial purposes. Countries such as the United Kingdom still use horse-drawn carriages to convey royalty and other VIPs to and from certain culturally significant events. Public exhibitions are another example, such as the Budweiser Clydesdales, seen in parades and other public settings, a team of draft horses that pull a beer wagon similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> before {{the invention of the}} modern motorized truck.|$|E
5|$|Palmyra {{had a large}} agora. However, {{unlike the}} Greek Agoras (public {{gathering}} places shared with public buildings), Palmyra's agora resembled an Eastern caravanserai more than a hub of public life. The Palmyrenes buried their dead in elaborate family mausoleums, most with interior walls forming rows of burial chambers (loculi) in which the dead, laying at full length, were placed. A relief of the person interred formed part of the wall's decoration, acting as a headstone. Sarcophagi appeared in the late second century and were used {{in some of the}} tombs. Many burial monuments contained mummies embalmed in a method similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> in Ancient Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Pink Floyd {{spent more}} than two weeks rehearsing in a hangar at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, California, before opening on 29 March 1994, in Miami, with an almost {{identical}} road crew <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> for their Momentary Lapse of Reason tour. They played a variety of Pink Floyd favourites, and later changed their setlist to include The Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety. The tour, Pink Floyd's last, ended on 29 October 1994.|$|E

5|$|Silk {{is mainly}} {{composed}} of a protein very similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> in insect silk. It is initially a liquid, and hardens not by exposure to air {{but as a result}} of being drawn out, which changes the internal structure of the protein. It is similar in tensile strength to nylon and biological materials such as chitin, collagen and cellulose, but is much more elastic. In other words, it can stretch much further before breaking or losing shape.|$|E
5|$|Some teams made {{technical}} {{changes to}} their cars for the Grand Prix. McLaren introduced a revised aerodynamic for their MP4/15 chassis, aimed at {{increasing the amount}} of downforce, and therefore grip, produced by the bodywork. They also brought revised nose wings. BAR fitted their cars with one-off components that were produced to help optimise the performance of the monocoque's cooling systems. Ferrari introduced an aerodynamic set-up similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> at the Monaco Grand Prix, and the team debuted {{a modified version of the}} F1-2000's chimneys. Minardi arrived with new radiator intakes and exits to rectify temperature issues with their Fondmetal V10 engines.|$|E
5|$|The Jags {{flirted with}} a number of colour schemes in their early years. From their {{inception}} until 1900 the kits were predominantly blue with red and white trimmings. There was then a brief period in which the players wore an orange and black striped top with white shorts and black socks. This was replaced in 1905 by a colour scheme close <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> by Aston Villa, before the club reverted to the predominantly blue kits in 1909. In season 1936–37 they changed to, and settled upon, the red-yellow-and-black attire for which they are best known, this change having been triggered initially by the club borrowing kits from the local rugby union team, West of Scotland Football Club.|$|E

Nevertheless, the Japan to Washington flight pioneered a route similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> by later airliners. Importantly for the airmen, America was able to demonstrate the reach of airpower {{in light of the}} nascent Cold War.|$|E
5|$|The food {{industry}} {{is also a}} major consumer of amino acids, in particular, glutamic acid, which {{is used as a}} flavor enhancer, and aspartame (aspartyl-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester) as a low-calorie artificial sweetener. Similar technology <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> for animal nutrition is employed in the human nutrition industry to alleviate symptoms of mineral deficiencies, such as anemia, by improving mineral absorption and reducing negative side effects from inorganic mineral supplementation.|$|E
5|$|The missionaries {{introduced}} a musical form of chant into Britain, similar <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>used</b> in Rome during the mass. During the 7th and 8th centuries Canterbury was renowned for the excellence of its clergy's chanting, and sent singing masters to instruct others, including two to Wilfrid, who became Bishop of York. Putta, the first Bishop of Rochester, {{had a reputation}} for his skill at chanting, which he was said to have learned from the Gregorian missionaries. One of them, James the Deacon, taught chanting in Northumbria after Paulinus returned to Kent; Bede noted that James was accomplished in the singing of the chants.|$|E
