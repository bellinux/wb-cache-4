The strategy was implemented at a free-standing two story <b>two-family</b> <b>dwelling</b> and a larger free-standing multifamily building. The test homes selected for this research represent predominant housing types for the Chicago area. High heating energy use typical in these buildings threaten housing affordability. Uninsulated mass masonry wall assemblies also have a strongly detrimental impact on comfort.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this report is to provide an implementation guide to understanding the Energy Efficiency in Buildings (EEB) model as applied to the Swedish Residential sector. The report depicts the work that prepares the ground to use and test the model to evaluate energy efficiency policy instruments targeting the Swedish residential sector during {{the next phase of}} the project. It is argued will argue that EEB model offers an opportunity to capture or integrate critical modelling aspects that justify our project. For instance, the model has been developed to explicitly analyse energy efficiency policies targeting the building sector. In addition, the model allows to some extent the simulation of decentralised micro-economic technology choice. Importantly, decisions about technology choice are subject to financial and also non-economic factors (e. g. appearance).

40|$|ABSTRACT: In Honolulu, the {{building}} permit {{process has been}} likened to a black box, synonymous with regulatory barriers and unbearable delays. In response, homeowners cultivate gray spaces: ambiguous accessory spaces such as “Hobby, ” “TV ” or “Rumpus Rooms ” that are issued permits and then frequently converted illegally into an independent dwelling unit. In essence, these Illegal Accessory Dwellings function as non-permitted second units on land zoned for single-family use. This paper proposes to quantify the number of Illegal Accessory Dwellings in Honolulu, {{based on the number}} of residential buildings permits issued for spaces that could be easily converted into a separate rental unit. Using building permit data provides a systematic method to analyze all legally sanctioned building activity, pinpointing only those residential layouts that are highly suspicious for being converted into a separate rental unit. In so doing, this paper makes a key distinction: a structure can be built to code, but its occupancy – how it is used – can still be illegal. From 2005 - 2012, this paper found that Illegal Accessory Dwellings comprised a low of 30 % up to 46 % of all new one and <b>two-family</b> <b>dwellings</b> units created. The highest rate of production was in 2008, during the Great Recession. Thus, this paper suggests that Illegal Accessory Dwellings contribute a substantial number of units to the overall housing supply. This paper also raises questions such as – How are these units being counted in the official US Census? Are they counted as separate households or as part of the primary residence? Given the significant number of this type of housing, how Illegal Accessory Dwellings are characterized could potentially shift the landscape of where urban growth is occurring. Research methods include correlational research, GIS mapping and case studies, to explain how homeowners circumvent the rules...|$|R
40|$|To {{encourage}} {{new developments}} in building technology, a solid basis for building code requirements is needed. Fire endurance is a code requirement, yet no objective procedure exists for computing a structure’s chances of failing (degree of risk) in a fire. However, a model for predicting the fire endurance of part of a structure, a conventional unprotected wood joist floor, is available. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the fire endurance performance of an unprotected wood joist floor for use in the model. Eleven ASTM Standard E 119 floor tests were conducted. All the floors were 2 by 10 Douglas-fir wood joists, sixteen inches on center with 2 3 / 32 -inch-thick plywood as the floor sheathing. In addition to one trial test, five tests were conducted using a live load of 11. 35 lb/ft 2. For the other five tests, the live load was 79. 2 lb/ft 2. Twenty joists were tested for modulus of elasticity and modulus of rupture. The joist population had a mean modulus of rupture of 5, 280 lb/in. 2 and a mean modulus of elasticity of 1, 530, 000 lb/in. 2. For the five floors loaded to 11. 35 lb/ft 2, the mean time for initial joist failure was 17. 9 min with a coefficient of variation (COV) of 3. 7 %. For the five floors loaded to 79. 2 lb/ft 2, the mean time was 6. 5 min with a COV of 11. 6 %. Based on linear interpolation of these results, first joist failure would have occurred in 13. 1 min if a 40 lb/ft 2 live load had been used, which is the typical live loading specified in the building codes for residential one- and <b>two-family</b> <b>dwellings.</b> As a result of this study, fire-resistance performance of a wood floor is known for a specific population of wood joists with known structural properties. These results can be used to verify and revise the model for predicting fire endurance...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the out-of-plane seismic performance of anchored brick veneer with wood-frame backup wall systems, to evaluate prescriptive design requirements and current construction practices. Prescriptive requirements for the design and construction of anchored brick veneer are currently provided by the Masonry Standards Joint Committee (MSJC) Building Code, the International Residential Code (IRC) for Oneand <b>Two-Family</b> <b>Dwellings,</b> and the Brick Industry Association (BIA) Technical Notes. Laboratory tests were conducted on brick-tie-wood subassemblies, comprising two bricks with a corrugated sheet metal tie either nail- or screw-attached to a wood stud, permitting an evaluation of the stiffness, strength, and failure modes for a local portion of a veneer wall system, rather than just of a single tie by itself. Then, full-scale brick veneer wall specimens (two one-story solid walls, as well as a one-and-a-half story wall with a window opening and a gable region) were tested under static and dynamic out-of-plane loading on a shake table. The shake table tests captured the performance of brick veneer wall systems, including interaction and load-sharing between the brick veneer, corrugated sheet metal ties, and wood-frame backup. Finally, all of these test results were used to develop finite element models of brick veneer wall systems, including nonlinear inelastic properties for the tie connections. The experimental and analytical studies showed that the out-of-plane seismic performance of residential anchored brick veneer walls is generally governed by: tensile stiffness and strength properties of the tie connections, as controlled by tie installation details; overall grid spacing of the tie connections, especially for tie installation along the edges and in the upper regions of walls; and, overall wall geometric variations. Damage limit states for single-story residential brick veneer wall systems were established from the experimental and analytical studies as a function of tensile failure of key tie connections, and the seismic fragility of this form of construction was then evaluated. Based on the overall findings, it is recommended that codes incorporate specific requirements for tie connection installation along all brick veneer wall edges, as well as for tie connection installation at reduced spacings in the upper regions of wall panels and near stiffer regions of the backup. Residential anchored brick veneer construction should as a minimum be built in accordance with the current prescriptive code requirements and recommendations, throughout low to moderate seismicity regions of the central and eastern U. S., whereas non-compliant methods of construction commonly substituted in practice are generally not acceptable. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the building code requirements and impediments to applying photovoltaic (PV) and solar-thermal technologies in residential buildings (one- or <b>two-family</b> <b>dwellings).</b> It reviews six modern model building codes {{that represent the}} codes to be adopted by most locations in the coming years: International Residential Code, First Draft (IRC), International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), International Mechanical Code (IMC), International Plumbing Code (IPC), International Fuel Gas Code (IFGC), and National Electrical Code (NEC). The IRC may become the basis {{for many of the}} building codes in the United States after it is released in 2000, and it references the other codes that will also likely become applicable at that time. These codes are reviewed as they apply to photovoltaic systems in buildings and building-integrated photovoltaic systems and to active-solar domestic hot-water and space-heating systems. The first discussion is on general code issues that impact the s e technologies-for example, solar access and sustainability. Then, secondly, the discussion investigates the relationship of the technologies to the codes, providing examples, while keeping two major issues in mind: How do the codes treat these technologies as building components? and Do the IECC and other codes allow reasonable credit for the energy impacts of the technologies? The codes can impact the implementation of the above technologies in several ways: (1) The technology is not mentioned in the codes. It may be an obstacle to implementing the technology, and the solution is to develop appropriate explicit sections or language in the codes. (2) The technology is discussed by the codes, but the language is confusing or ambiguous. The solution is to clarify the language. (3) The technology is discussed in the codes, but the discussion is spread over several sections or different codes. Practitioners may not easily find all of the relevant material that should be considered. The so lution is to put all relevant information in one section or to more clearly reference relevant sections. (4) The technology is prohibited by the code. Examples of this situation were not found. However, energy credit for some technologies cannot be achieved with the requirements of these codes. Finally, four types of future action are recommended to make the codes reviewed in this report more accommodating to renewable energy technologies: (1) Include suggested language additions and changes in the codes; (2) Create new code sections that place all of the requirements for a technology in one section of an appropriate code; (3) Apply existing standards, as appropriate, to innovative renewable energy and energy conservation technologies; and (4) Develop new standards, as necessary, to ease code compliance. A synergy may be possible in developing suitable code language changes for both photovoltaic and solar hot-water systems. The installation of rooftop photovoltaic panels and solar hot- water collectors involves many overlapping issues. Roof loading, weather tightness, mounting systems, roof penetrations, and similar concerns are identical for both technologies. If such work can be coordinated, organizations supporting both technologies could work together to implement the appropriate revisions and additions to the codes...|$|R
