5|$|Beata {{reveals that}} <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> four male {{survivors}} of the Odin who have caused disruption in their society, and are considered fugitives. Beata requests Riker stay with her (and later requests that he order Troi, Data, and Yar {{to track down the}} survivors' camp and their leader Ramsey (Sam Hennings), while staying and dining with her). After some back and forth, Data concludes Ramsey and the {{survivors of the}} Odin would have platinum with them, and Angel One is naturally devoid of platinum, allowing the Enterprise to easily detect them. Meanwhile, Riker dresses in the garb given to him for his dinner with Beata, Troi and Yar taunt him for dressing in clothes that sexualize him and in some ways demean him, and he is only doing it to win favor with Beata. He responds by saying he is honoring the local customs, and acknowledges Beata's beauty, and that the garb is rather comfortable.|$|E
5|$|Movement {{catches the}} eye of prey animals {{on the lookout for}} predators, and of predators hunting for prey. Most methods of crypsis {{therefore}} also require suitable cryptic behaviour, such as lying down and keeping still to avoid being detected, {{or in the case of}} stalking predators such as the tiger, moving with extreme stealth, both slowly and quietly, watching its prey for any sign <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> its presence. As an example of the combination of behaviours and other methods of crypsis involved, young giraffes seek cover, lie down, and keep still, often for hours until their mothers return; their skin pattern blends with the pattern of the vegetation, while the chosen cover and lying position together hide the animals' shadows. The flat-tail horned lizard similarly relies on a combination of methods: it is adapted to lie flat in the open desert, relying on stillness, its cryptic coloration, and concealment of its shadow to avoid being noticed by predators. In the ocean, the leafy sea dragon sways mimetically, like the seaweeds amongst which it rests, as if rippled by wind or water currents. Swaying is seen also in some insects, like Macleay's Spectre stick insect, Extatosoma tiaratum. The behaviour may be motion crypsis, preventing detection, or motion masquerade, promoting misclassification (as something other than prey), or a combination of the two.|$|E

25|$|Littlejohn {{was accused}} of taking {{insufficient}} care to check the facts before publishing an article critical of cookery writer and poverty campaigner Jack Monroe. Littlejohn suggested Monroe, who prefers the singular they pronoun, chose {{to give up their}} job; in fact Monroe's young boy was unsettled with a range of different carers. As Monroe had grown up in a home with foster children <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the potential for harming him. Monroe tried unsuccessfully to negotiate flexible hours so they could work and look after their baby, but gave up their job so they could look after the child better.

Thereupon, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the horse, and then <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> Sir Launcelot where he lay asleep under the apple-tree, with his head lying upon his helmet.|$|R
500|$|Asturias shows how, {{under the}} {{conditions}} of dictatorship, characters slowly lose their human identities. The Zany, for instance, while fleeing the city, is described as running [...] "aimlessly, with his mouth opened and his tongue hanging out, slobbering and panting". Just a few lines later, the Zany is [...] "whin like an injured dog". In what is in part {{a critique of the}} book, Jorge Barrueto argues that [...] depicts Latin America as a whole as [...] "Other". [...] Everyone from the President to the Zany displays this [...] "otherness" [...] as they cannot be civilized. Dictatorship produces Otherness, by dehumanizing its subjects, but is also itself presented as barbaric, absurd, and no more than an [...] "imitation of the European ways". [...] Thanks to phenomena such as dictatorship, Latin America appears to be a land where [...] "Otherness" [...] prevails and for this reason Latin America cannot [...] "evolve" [...] or reach truly European levels of modernity. [...] For Barrueto, [...] "this narrative's goal is to prove that Latin American societies, though <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the blueprint of Modernity, are unable to act accordingly." ...|$|E
500|$|... {{the rate}} at which the diver consumes gas, {{specified}} as surface air consumption (SAC) or respiratory minute volume (RMV) of the diver. In normal conditions this will be between 10 and 25 litres per minute (L/min) for divers who are not working hard. At times of extreme high work rate, breathing rates can rise to 95 litres per minute. For International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA) commercial diving gas planning purposes, a working breathing rate of 40 litres per minute is used, whilst a figure of 50 litres per minute is used for emergencies. RMV is controlled by blood CO2 levels, and is usually independent of oxygen partial pressures, so does not change with depth. The very large range of possible rates of gas consumption results in a significant uncertainty of how long the supply will last, and a conservative approach is required for safety where an immediate access to an alternative breathing gas source is not possible. Scuba divers are expected to monitor the remaining gas pressure sufficiently often that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> how much is still available at all times during a dive.|$|E
500|$|The {{claimant}} {{must first}} {{show that the}} defendant's actions have caused an interference with their use or enjoyment of the land. These interferences are indirect, and almost always the result of continuing events rather than a one-off incident. This interference may be a physical invasion of the land, such as in Davey v Harrow Corporation, noise, as in Christie v Davey, or smells, such as in Wheeler v J J Saunders. The courts have allowed cases where the interference causes emotional distress, as in Thompson-Schwab v Costaki, but have been loath to protect recreational facilities or [...] "things of delight"; things such as the blocking of a pleasant view or a television signal are not considered a nuisance. The latter was discussed in Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd, where the claimants argued that the blocking of their television signal by {{the construction of the}} skyscraper at One Canada Square was a nuisance. The House of Lords rejected this argument. There are rights to land known as servitudes, such as the right to light through windows or the right of support. An occupier can also be liable for an interference that is naturally arising, assuming <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the interference's existence and fail to take reasonable precautions, as in Leakey v National Trust, which established that in such situations [...] "the standard ought to be to require of the occupier what is reasonable to expect of him in his individual circumstances". This principle was extended in Holbeck Hall Hotel v Scarborough Borough Council, where the Court of Appeal said that if a landowner knows or ought to know that their property may cease to support another's, they are required to take reasonable precautions or they will be liable.|$|E

2500|$|It {{should be}} noted that most of the Irish {{migration}} to Newfoundland was pre-famine (late 18th century and early 19th century), and two centuries of isolation have led many of Irish descent in Newfoundland to consider their ethnic identity as [...] "Newfoundlander," [...] and not [...] "Irish," [...] although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> the cultural links between the two.|$|E

2500|$|Farmers need to {{be better}} educated {{on the subject of}} CBSD, {{including}} cause, diagnosis and disease spread. [...] The most obvious symptom of the disease is the cassava root rot, and farmers are inclined to believe that too much water causes the rotting rather than the virus. The identification of the foliar symptoms is important, because farmers can get a more accurate yield expectation without waiting for the harvest period. [...] Also, awareness of tolerant varieties can be promoted. [...] It is suggested that workshops be held for researchers, so that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> new diagnostics.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his esteem in {{the writing}} community, Serling found the series {{difficult}} to sell. Few critics felt that science fiction could transcend empty escapism and enter the realm of adult drama. In a September 22, 1959, interview with Serling, Mike Wallace asked a question illustrative of the times: [...] "...ou're going to be, obviously, working so hard on The Twilight Zone that, in essence, {{for the time being}} and for the foreseeable future, you've given up on writing anything important for television, right?" [...] While Serling's appearances on the show became one of its most distinctive features, with his clipped delivery still widely imitated today, he was reportedly nervous about it and had to be persuaded to appear on camera. Serling often steps {{into the middle of the}} action while the characters remain oblivious to him, but on one notable occasion, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> his presence: In the episode [...] "A World of His Own", a writer (Keenan Wynn) with the power to alter his reality objects to Serling's narration, and promptly erases Serling from the show.|$|E
