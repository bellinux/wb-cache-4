5|$|According {{to another}} legend, {{there was once}} a sea where the Dnieper River now flows. When Saint Andrew came to Kiev and erected a cross on the place where the Saint Andrew's Church now stands, the sea went away. The only part that {{remained}} of <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>is</b> under the mountain on which Kiev sits today. When the church was built there in the 18th century, a spring opened under the altar. The church has no bells, because, according to the legend, when the first bell strikes, the water can revive again and flood the left bank of Kiev.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa {{nevertheless}} {{continued to}} work. He wrote the original screenplays <b>The</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>is</b> Watching in 1993 and After the Rain in 1995. While putting {{finishing touches on}} the latter work in 1995, Kurosawa slipped and broke {{the base of his}} spine. Following the accident, he would use a wheelchair {{for the rest of his}} life, putting an end to any hopes of him directing another film. His longtime wish—to die on the set while shooting a movie—was never to be fulfilled.|$|E
5|$|Sea Mither, or Mither of <b>the</b> <b>Sea,</b> <b>is</b> {{a mythical}} being of Orcadian {{folklore}} {{that lives in}} the sea during summer, when she confines the demonic nuckelavee to the ocean depths. Each spring she battles with her arch-enemy Teran, another spirit of Orcadian legend capable of causing severe winter storms, {{to gain control of}} the seas and the weather. Eventually Sea Mither overcomes Teran and sends him to the depths of the ocean, but the effort of keeping him confined there along with her other benevolent labours during the summer exhaust her, until in the autumn Teran takes advantage of her weakness to wrest control from her once again.|$|E

She recorded The Sea at Limefield Studios in Manchester, England during 2009, working mostly with a host of session musicians and the record producers Steve Brown and Steve Chrisanthou. It features songs written by Rae before and after her husband's death, touching on themes of love, lament, and solace.|$|E
5|$|The {{burial of}} entire or cremated bodies at sea has been practised by {{countries}} around the world since ancient times, with instances recorded from the ancient civilisations in Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Practices vary by country and by religion; for example, the United States allows human remains to be buried at sea at least 3 nautical miles from land, and if the remains are uncremated the water must be at least 600 feet deep, while in Islam burial by lowering a weighted clay vessel into <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>is</b> permitted when a person dies on a ship.|$|E
5|$|The sea {{and ships}} have been {{depicted}} in art ranging from simple drawings {{on the walls}} of huts in Lamu to seascapes by Joseph Turner and Dutch Golden Age painting. The Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai created colour prints of the moods of the sea, including The Great Wave off Kanagawa. The sea has appeared in literature since Homer's Odyssey (8th century BC). <b>The</b> <b>sea</b> <b>is</b> a recurring theme in the Haiku poems of the Japanese Edo period poet Matsuo Bashō (松尾 芭蕉) (1644–1694).|$|E

5|$|The sea {{appears in}} human culture in {{contradictory}} ways, as both powerful but serene and as beautiful but dangerous. It has {{its place in}} mythology and religion, literature, art, poetry, film, theater, and music. The Ancients personified it, believing it {{to be under the}} control of a being who needed to be appeased. It has been populated by fantastic creatures: the Leviathan of the Bible, Scylla in Greek mythology, Isonade in Japanese mythology, and the kraken of late Norse mythology. <b>The</b> <b>sea</b> <b>is</b> especially common in Christian imagery, where several of Jesus's disciples were said to have been fishermen on the Sea of Galilee.|$|E
5|$|After his accident, Kurosawa's health {{began to}} deteriorate. While his mind {{remained}} sharp and lively, {{his body was}} giving up, {{and for the last}} half-year of his life, the director was largely confined to bed, listening to music and watching television at home. On September 6, 1998, Kurosawa died of a stroke in Setagaya, Tokyo, at the age of 88. At the time of his death, Kurosawa had two children, his son Hisao Kurosawa who married Hiroko Hayashi and his daughter Kazuko Kurosawa who married Harayuki Kato, along with several grandchildren. One of his grandchildren, the actor Takayuki Kato and , became a supporting actor in two films posthumously developed from screenplays written by Kurosawa which remained unproduced during his own lifetime, Takashi Koizumi's After the Rain (1999) and Kei Kumai's <b>The</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>is</b> Watching (2002).|$|E
5|$|Distance from <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>is</b> another {{important}} geographic factor. Owing {{to the shape}} of the country, the close proximity to the ocean means that most of the country, excluding the north is moderated by the surrounding oceans, leading to lower thermal amplitudes than comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere. The two main currents that impact the climate of Argentina are the Brazil Current from the north and the Malvinas Current from the south (a branch of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current). The Brazil Current transports warm subtropical waters southwards while the Malvinas Current transports cold, subantarctic waters northwards. The Malvinas Current cools the coastal areas, particularly during winter when the current is more stronger. Thus, coastal areas of the Pampas have cooler summers and a longer frost period owing to the cold Malvinas Current. As well, it is the main factor in making Tierra del Fuego colder than at comparable latitudes in the northern hemisphere in Europe since it is influenced by the cold Malvinas Current rather than the warm North Atlantic Current.|$|E
25|$|The {{identity}} of the foes remained a question. The evidence suggests that some of <b>the</b> <b>Sea</b> Peoples may have been Greek. However, most of the destroyed Mycenaean sites <b>are</b> far from <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> and <b>the</b> expedition against Troy {{at the end of}} this period shows that <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>was</b> safe.

5|$|Following Kurosawa's death, several posthumous works {{based on}} his unfilmed screenplays have been produced. After the Rain, {{directed}} by Takashi Koizumi, was released in 1998, and <b>The</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>is</b> Watching, directed by Kei Kumai, premiered in 2002. A script created by the Yonki no Kai ("Club of the Four Knights") (Kurosawa, Keisuke Kinoshita, Masaki Kobayashi, and Kon Ichikawa), around the time that Dodeskaden was made, finally was filmed and released (in 2000) as Dora-Heita, by the only surviving {{founding member of the}} club, Kon Ichikawa. Huayi Brothers Media and CKF Pictures in China announced in 2017 plans to produce a film of Kurosawa's posthumous screenplay of The Masque of the Black Death by Edgar Allan Poe for 2020. Patrick Frater writing for Variety magazine in May 2017 stated that another two unfinished films by Kurosawa were planned, with Silvering Spear to start filming in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Since Roman times, silting {{and land}} {{reclamation}} in the Pevensey Levels {{have pushed the}} coastline out by about , leaving the castle landlocked. The land between the castle and <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>is</b> now a flat marshland drained by a network of ditches and sewers or field drains. The modern village of Pevensey is situated mostly {{to the east of}} the castle, {{at the end of the}} ancient peninsula. Castle Road (the B2191) curves around the Roman north wall and connects Pevensey to the nearby village of Westham. A public footpath crosses the interior of the castle, linking the two villages. An area of reclaimed land, formerly part of the Pevensey tidal lagoon but now marshland and fields crossed by the Eastbourne to Hastings railway line, is situated immediately to the south of the castle.|$|E
5|$|The Adriatic Sea {{sits on the}} Apulian or Adriatic Microplate, which {{separated}} from the African Plate in the Mesozoic era. The plate's movement contributed {{to the formation of}} the surrounding mountain chains and Apennine tectonic uplift after its collision with the Eurasian plate. In the Late Oligocene, the Apennine Peninsula first formed, separating the Adriatic Basin {{from the rest of the}} Mediterranean. All types of sediment are found in the Adriatic, with the bulk of the material transported by the Po and other rivers on the western coast. The western coast is alluvial or terraced, while the eastern coast is highly indented with pronounced karstification. There are dozens of marine protected areas in the Adriatic, designed to protect the sea's karst habitats and biodiversity. <b>The</b> <b>sea</b> <b>is</b> abundant in flora and fauna—more than 7,000 species are identified as native to the Adriatic, many of them endemic, rare and threatened ones.|$|E

5|$|Altdorfer's primary {{point of}} {{reference}} in his research was probably Hartmann Schedel's Nuremberg Chronicle (Schedelsche Weltchronik), an illustrated world history published in Nuremberg in 1493. Schedel was a physician, humanist, historian and cartographer, and his Chronicle {{was one of the}} first books produced on the printing press. With a heavy reliance on the Bible, it recounts the seven ages of human history, from Creation to the birth of Christ and ending with the Apocalypse. Altdorfer's statistics for the battle of Issus mirror those of Schedel. Furthermore, the errors in Schedel's maps of the Mediterranean and Northern Africa are also present in The Battle of Alexander at Issus: the island of Cyprus is noticeably oversized, and both the mountain rise in the painting's centre and the range adjacent to the Nile do not exist. Since the Chronicle describes Alexander's victory over the Persians in terms of its proximity to Tarsus and omits mention of Issus, it is likely that the cityscape by <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> <b>is</b> intended to be the former city rather than the latter. Issus in the 16th century was minor and relatively unknown, whereas Tarsus was renowned for its having been a major centre of learning and philosophy in Roman times. Tarsus was also said to be the birthplace of the Apostle Paul, which may explain the presence of the church towers in Altdorfer's portrayal. Another source may have been the writings of Quintus Curtius Rufus, a 1st-century Roman historian who presents inflated figures for the number of killed and taken prisoner and the sizes of the armies.|$|E
