5|$|A {{foundation}} {{member of}} the Toorak College council in 1927, Mary served as its president from 1947 to 1948 and again from 1960 to 1970. She played tennis and golf, and when her two eldest daughters began playing hockey at school, Mary's interest in hockey was rekindled. A strong believer in the principle <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> not men should administer women's sports, she became a {{member of the}} Victorian Women's Amateur Sports Council, and was later the patron of the Victorian Women's Hockey Association. Players visiting from interstate would often stay at her home. This was extended to overseas visitors during the 1956 Summer Olympics, which were held in Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|After Myanmar's {{government}} {{failed to}} respond to the devastating effects of Cyclone Nargis in 2008, officials responded more quickly to the floods and the effects from Komen. Relief supplies were airdropped to marooned villages, assisting the Rohingya people in Rakhine. The government allocated US$1.2million toward supplying farmers with rice paddy seeds to regrow damaged crops. About half of the damaged crop was replanted by November 2015, and in most areas, the grounds remained fertile for future growing. Local businesses donated K2.06billion toward buying supplies, and businessman Aung Ko Win donated US$3.6million. The Myanmar Red Cross, which was already responding to the ongoing flooding, provided additional supplies and assisted with evacuations. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies assisted in these efforts by providing rice and blankets. Volunteers distributed sleeping mats, mosquito nets, medical supplies, and tarps. Various United Nations agencies assisted the residents in displaced camps that were affected further by Komen. Within a month of the storm, the World Food Programme had provided meals to over 450,000people. Food and oil prices rose in the weeks after the floods, and the price of rice reached record levels in the country in August and September 2015. The cost gradually declined after the next rice harvest. To help unemployed farm workers, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation financed a program to pay storm victims to rebuild damaged embankments and restore clean water access. An assessment by the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Myanmar government found <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> children were the worst affected group during and after the disaster, due to the stresses of the damaged houses, and insufficient food and assistance in the subsequent months.|$|E

During the interview for a featured article in GQ's January 2014 issue, titled What the Duck?, Magary asked Robertson: [...] "What, in your mind, is sinful?"

25|$|Massachusetts also endured class {{conflict}} during this period. In the 1912 general strike in Lawrence, {{almost all of}} the town's mills were forced to shut down as a result of strife over wages that sustained only poverty. The Commonwealth was confronted with issues of worker conditions and wages. For example, when the legislature decreed <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> children could work only 50 hours per week, employers cut wages proportionally. Eventually, the demands of the Lawrence strikers were heeded, and a pay increase was made.|$|E
25|$|After the Kansas campaign, the AERA {{increasingly}} {{divided into}} two wings, both advocating universal suffrage but with different approaches. One wing, whose leading figure was Lucy Stone, was willing for black men to achieve suffrage first and wanted to maintain close ties with the Republican Party and the abolitionist movement. The other, whose leading figures were Anthony and Stanton, insisted <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> black men should be enfranchised {{at the same time}} and worked toward a politically independent women's movement that would no longer be dependent on abolitionists. The AERA effectively dissolved after an acrimonious meeting in May 1869, and two competing woman suffrage organizations were created in its aftermath.|$|E

25|$|Rachel Foster {{was born}} in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Julia Manuel Foster and J. Heron Foster, {{the editor of the}} Pittsburgh Dispatch.

Stanton held suffrage meetings at the Foster home, and Rachel's mother became vice president of the local suffrage society. After J. Heron Foster's death in 1868, Rachel, her sister Julia, and her mother moved to Philadelphia, where they joined the Citizens' Suffrage Association.|$|E
25|$|The {{target of}} the right-wing vested {{interests}} was a famous annual May Day celebration at the Portella della Ginestra. A {{few days before the}} festivities, Giuliano received a letter that was evidently the culmination of negotiations. After reading it, the bandit chieftain burned it and announced, “The hour of our liberation has come. We are going to attack the Communists, to go to fire on them on May 1 at Portella della Ginestra.” One of his bandits protested <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> children would be present. The chieftain replied that only leaders would be targeted. Giuliano's behavior before and after the armed action indicate that he believed that he and his men would be offered pardons for their crimes if all went well on May Day, an outcome ostensibly guaranteed by some prominent Sicilian. According to Giuliano's later statements, his main aim of the day was the capture of Girolamo Li Causi, head of the Communist party of Sicily—any other action was a diversionary tactic to facilitate Li Causi's capture. Although scheduled to speak, Li Causi did not attend.|$|E
500|$|The {{immediate}} {{cause of the}} split was the proposed Fifteenth Amendment, which would prohibit the denial of suffrage because of race. In {{one of their most}} controversial moves, Anthony and Stanton campaigned against the amendment, insisting <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> African Americans should be enfranchised at the same time. [...] They said that by effectively enfranchising all men while excluding all women, the amendment would create an [...] "aristocracy of sex" [...] by giving constitutional authority to the idea that men were superior to women.|$|E

The NAP-CHT also says <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> girls are the most common victims of human trafficking. Randy Hoback, MP for Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, said that the goals of the action plan included [...] "enhancing the response of law enforcement and the justice system to cases of missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls and supporting culturally appropriate victim's services." [...] The NAP-CHT document states that there had been 25 human-trafficking-specific convictions in Canada prior to April 2012, and that 41 people had been victims of those 25 crimes.|$|E

500|$|The actress {{described}} {{the filming of}} the rape as easier than the scenes depicting its aftermath, which she called [...] "psychologically ..... physically hard". Strickland and Brendon agreed on a safeword when they filmed the rape, due to its brutality. The scene affected Strickland {{to the extent that}} she found it difficult to act on the set on which the rape was shot. The actress called the filming process [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "truthful", but [...] "by no means is any of that even comparable to anything <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> men have had experience with". Brendon was cast against type as McHenry, King's rapist, since he is primarily known for portraying the comedic Xander Harris in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Strickland said that Brendon's character should not be interpreted as crazy, because perpetrators of rape are [...] "people who are around us all the time"; she called Brendon's acceptance of the role [...] "brave".|$|E

500|$|Her {{attitude}} and language often sharply polarized debate, and made Dworkin herself {{a figure of}} intense controversy. After her death, the conservative gay writer Andrew Sullivan claimed that [...] "Many on the social right liked Andrea Dworkin. Like Dworkin, their essential impulse when they see human beings living freely {{is to try and}} control or stop them [...] for their own good. Like Dworkin, they are horrified by male sexuality, and see men as such as a problem to be tamed. Like Dworkin, they believe {{in the power of the}} state to censor and coerce sexual freedoms. Like Dworkin, they view the enormous new freedom <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> gay people have acquired since the 1960s as a terrible development for human culture." [...] Libertarian/conservative journalist Cathy Young complained of a [...] "whitewash" [...] in feminist obituaries for Dworkin, argued that Dworkin's positions were manifestly misandrist, stated that Dworkin was in fact insane, criticized what she called Dworkin's [...] "destructive legacy", and described Dworkin as a [...] "sad ghost" [...] that feminism needs to exorcise.|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} religious {{figure in the}} colony was John Robinson, an original pastor of the Scrooby congregation and religious leader of the separatists throughout the Leiden years. He never actually set foot in New England, but many of his theological pronouncements shaped the nature and character of the Plymouth church. For example, Robinson stated <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> men have different social roles according to a law of nature, though neither was lesser {{in the eyes of}} God. Robinson taught that men and women have distinct but complementary roles in church, home, and society as a whole. [...] He referred to women as the [...] "weaker vessel". In matters of religious understanding, he proclaimed that it was the man's role to educate and [...] "guide and go before" [...] women. He also said that women should be [...] "subject" [...] to their husbands. Robinson also dictated the proper methods of child rearing—he prescribed a strict upbringing with a strong emphasis on corporal punishment. He believed that a child's natural inclination towards independence was a manifestation of original sin and should thus be repressed.|$|E

[...] Dyer nevertheless continued to travel in New England to preach her Quaker message, and in early 1658 was arrested in the New Haven Colony, and then expelled for preaching her [...] "inner light" [...] belief, and the notion <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> men stood on equal ground in church worship and organization. [...] In addition to sharing her Quaker message, she had come to New Haven with two others to visit Humphrey Norton who had been imprisoned for three weeks. [...] Anti-Quaker laws had been enacted there, and after Dyer was arrested, she was [...] "set on a horse", and forced to leave.|$|E

500|$|In 1678 Clement Clerke {{introduced}} the coal-powered reverberatory furnace, greatly increasing {{the quantity of}} metal extractable from ore. The Mines Royal Act 1689 ended Crown ownership of Cornwall's mines, allowing private investors and local families to begin mining operations. At the same time, the Nine Years' War (1688–97) and the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14) caused high demand for metals. As a consequence the Midlands, with easy river and canal access to the coal mines of Wales and northern England and to the metal mines of Cornwall, became a major centre for metallurgy. Ore was shipped from Cornwall up the River Severn to smelters in Gloucestershire where it was refined and sold on to the factories surrounding Birmingham. Financiers and entrepreneurs began investing in and reorganising the mines of Cornwall. With a shortage of manual labour in rural and lightly-populated Cornwall, and with a prevalent belief <b>that</b> <b>women</b> <b>and</b> children were best suited to ore separation (which required dexterity and good observation skills but {{little in the way}} of physical strength), the large-scale recruitment of women and girls to the mines began. It is around this time that the term [...] "bal maiden" [...] appears to have come into common usage, derived from the Old Cornish [...] (mine). A significant proportion of Cornwall's young women quickly became involved in mining; by 1736 the vicar of Ludgvan was complaining that he was unable to hire servants as the young women of the town were [...] "employed about copper".|$|E
