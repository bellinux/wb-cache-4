The occurrence of cross-country fault on transmission line will cause complex analysis such as unusual current distributions that compromise the seen impedance by units not directly involved in the fault loop, giving fault selector problems for close-in faults. The complex analysis may have effects on currents and the performance of distance relay. In accordance to this, the project will study the effects of cross-country fault to the power system and later analyze these effects. The modeling of line network with the occurrences of cross-country fault is simulated by using CAPE software. The simulation is conducted on 115 kV parallel line network whereby there were six phase of conductor which are three phase for circuit A and three phase for circuit B. Since the cross-country fault occur when there are two simultaneous one phase to earth fault, so there will be 3 × 3 which equal to nine combination of cross-country fault at an instantaneous time. All of these nine combinations of fault are simulated for distance less than 100 km for each line and also under zero fault impedance. The effects of cross-country fault to the power system are expected to be in terms of faulted phase, fault location, breaker tripping sequence and <b>tripping</b> <b>time.</b> It is found that the value of cross-country fault currents are changing when the faults are placed on different location of the parallel line network and the fault current will only be affected by the location of fault on parallel line network. The fastest <b>tripping</b> <b>time</b> for this network is 0. 033 sec while the latest <b>tripping</b> <b>time</b> is 0. 042 sec.

Thus, minimizing <b>tripping</b> <b>time</b> through choosing optimized tripping velocity becomes urgent. Surge or swab pressures in the wellbore and dynamic loading of drillstring will be generated during tripping. Also, dynamic velocity, {{which is the}} velocity {{at the bottom of}} drillstring, is different from the input velocity at surface. The effect of tripping velocity profile, i. e., tripping velocity changes with time, on the hook load, downhole pressure changes and drillstring dynamic velocity should be fully studied to achieve the optimization. In this study, the effects of tripping velocity profile on loading of drillstring, dynamic velocity and downhole pressure is investigated using numerical simulation. Bergeron's graphical method and Lubinski's approach are utilized to perform the simulations. Components of drillstring, wellbore depth, drillstring length and mud properties are also included in the simulations. Through the current work, a driller's typical way of changing tripping velocity {{may not be the best}} one. Selection of tripping velocity profiles should be adapted to depth: higher velocity, triangular/parabolic profiles in shallow wells and lower velocity, trapezoidal profiles in deep wells. Also, based on simulations, the oscillation magnitude of dynamic velocity can be as high as twice that of velocity at surface. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.

For protection of transmission line three stepped distance protection can provide remote backup protection to transmission line by zone 2 and zone 3, but during the calculation of operation setting for different protection zones of the distance relays, some problems have been raised (overlap and under reach). These problems cause improper trips in the network. The aims at overcoming the problems are by taking into consideration the specifications of the adjacent transmission lines, the effect of arc resistance, earth resistance and the effect of remote infeed. The line protection schemes are composed of distance relays and directional overcurrent relays where the setting of the relays must be computed considering both relays. Separate relay computation would lead to loss of selectivity. The standard IEC 60255 combined with the considerations of zone 2 <b>tripping</b> <b>time</b> have been used in order to overcome the coordination problems with the main protection (distance protection) as a local protection and to provide remote backup protection to the other overcurrent relays in the grid. In this project, the protection of the transmission lines in typical IEEE, 9 - busbars grid has been investigated in detail. The proper settings for both main protection (i. e. distance protection) and backup protection (i. e. overcurrent protection) devices have been determined.

These problems can be partly addressed by interconnecting distributed generators (DGs) with the distribution system to supply electric power from renewable energy resources such as photovoltaic (PV), wind, biomass, and fuel cells. One way of integrating a large number of DG sources with the distribution system is to interconnect them with low-voltage (LV) loads to form a microgrid (MG). Multi-microgrids (MMGs) increase the load capacity of the distribution system by integrating several MGs, DGs, and medium-voltage (MV) loads with the distribution system. This chapter discusses a number of challenges in the protection of active distribution systems, MGs, and MMGs. The existing protection schemes and coordination strategies to address these challenges are briefly reviewed in this chapter. This is followed by the presentation of a new protection scheme for MMGs. The existing protection scheme for MMGs originally proposed by the EU More Microgrids Project disconnects all the DG sources when fault conditions occur. As a result, this protection scheme prevents the continued operation of the MMG during fault conditions. The MMG also experiences varying fault current levels due to contributions from DGs and MGs compared to single grid-connected MGs. A new adaptive overcurrent protection scheme for MMGs containing MGs with varying generation and load is proposed in this chapter. It automates the setting of relay characteristics to deal with the variations of generation and load as well as adjust the <b>tripping</b> <b>time</b> delays based on the fault current levels. It also addresses the problems due to the presence of DGs such as the blinding of protection, failed reclosing, and false tripping.

The shortest path between any two nodes in the network depends not only on the travel time of links that constitutes the path but also on the time spent at the intersection which is {{a major part of the}} <b>trip</b> <b>time.</b> Existing algorithms found in the literature consider only the link travel time for the shortest path calculation between two nodes. A new algorithm is introduced in this study that calculates the dynamic minimum <b>trip</b> <b>time</b> path between two nodes by considering both link travel time and intersection turning delay. A macroscopic traffic simulator is developed to simulate vehicles that use the proposed algorithm to calculate the minimum <b>trip</b> <b>time</b> path.

40|$|The second {{harmonic}} inrush restraint function of transformer differential relays maintains {{security of the}} differential protection during transformer inrush events. The typical setpoint for the {{second harmonic}} restraint is the relay manufacturer’s default or recommended setting of 20 % of fundamental current, with some adjustment based on operating experience. However, some operating situations may result in levels of second harmonic current lower than 20 % during inrush, and levels may be as low as 5 %. This lower level of second harmonic current requires a lower inrush restraint setting that may impact the <b>tripping</b> <b>time</b> of the differential element for fault conditions. In addition, inrush restraint is typically performed on a per-phase basis, so a loss of security is possible if inrush restraint performs incorrectly on only one phase of the protected transformer. This paper provides several examples of actual events where loss of security occurred due to incorrect settings of the second harmonic restraint function, or due to mis-application of cross-phase blocking. Based on the information from these events, the paper directly discusses considerations and recommendations for setting the second harmonic restraint to maintain security during transformer inrush including a discussion of traditional and adaptive inrush restraint techniques. The paper also includes recommendations on when to apply cross-phase blocking techniques such as 1 -out-of- 3 blocking, 2 -out-of- 3 blocking and average restraint blocking methods. A key message from this paper {{is the use of}} the actual inrush characteristic of the protected transformer to determine optimum setpoints for the differential relay. Microprocessor relays have the capability to, and should, capture waveforms every time a transformer is energized. This data should be analyzed to check the adequacy of the existing second harmonic restraint settings, to ensure no loss of security occurs. 2...|$|E

The topic plug and abandonment has been well-recognized by the Norwegian authorities, the oil and {{gas industry}} and the public media due to the expected cost which will affect both Norwegian taxpayers, licence partners and operators working on the shelf. There has been a large emphasis to cut these cost, where companies are currently developing new solutions to enhance the process to plug and abandon wells. The concept “rig-less” P&A have been expressed as a futuristic goal from “Norwegian Oil and Gas” in their roadmap for new P&A technologies [1]. This thesis investigates performance differences of a purpose-built P&A unit based on previous performed well abandonments with regular jack-up rigs. The unit is designed to be a cost-efficient rig alternative to regular jack-up rigs, which is designed to perform heavier well operations, such as drilling. The study focus on P&A operations of offshore platform wells, and includes estimates of cost differences between the chosen concept and a standard jack-up rig. Variables like tripping speed, pumping capacities, tubing retrieval efficiency and durations to mobilize equipment will determine the performance of the unit. A lot of the time spent during a P&A operation is related to tripping of pipe. Wireline and coiled tubing are equipment that reduce <b>tripping</b> <b>time,</b> but will the relationship between cost and performance improvements be satisfactory? The findings of the study indicate that employment of the chosen rig design concept provides better economics in the specific well abandonments used for the comparison.

With the “Norwegian Oil and Gas” ambitions to develop more technology to increase rig-less P&A scope, this combination may be the preferred solution, to cope with the future needs...|$|E
40|$|The {{simulation}} program Alternative Transient Program {{is widely}} used in time-domain analysis of electrical systems. The program itself and its graphical pre-processor ATPDraw is under constant development. Implementation of complete protective relay models in ATPDraw {{is an important part}} of this development. Some work have been done on this already; models for transformer differential relays, overcurrent relays and distance relays have been implemented, as have digital signal processing (DSP) models based on RMS calculations and Fourier transforms. This report presents the results of a literature study on relay protection, corresponding digital signal processing and state-of-the art software modeling of protective relays. The features of currently implemented relay models in ATPDraw have been compared to relay models in similar software simulation programs and conventional relays. Furthermore, new DSP- and relay models have been implemented using the multi-purpose programming language MODELS. Finally, the performance of the relay models have been verified with a Siemens 7 SA 613 distance relay. The new ATPDraw relay models operate according to theory. When verified with Siemens 7 SA 613, the ATPDraw models have tripping times that are shorter than those of the relay. This may be caused by signal processing in the conventional relays that have not been incorporated in the software models. Inclusion of a low pass filter on the input signals somewhat increases the <b>tripping</b> <b>time</b> of the models, and hence decreases the error. Accurate software modeling of protective relays is requested by relay engineers due to the complexity of future power system planning. Several such models, e. g. the ones implemented in ATPDraw, are purely generic, and are best used in early state planning and for educational purposes. Some programs, on the other hand, offer models that imitate the behavior of conventional relays more accurately. ASPEN OneLiner provides several relay models categorized by manufacturer and relay design. The accuracy of software relay models may be questioned due to the fact that little is known about internal processing and algorithms of the relays, and the physical features of the relays which are hard to simulate. Many software models of varying complexity exist today. Common to these models is the need for caution with regards to their limitations. The models are best used for simple analysis and early phase planning. Both generic and complex relay models give good insight in protective relaying principles, and are well suited for educational purposes. </p...|$|E

30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{differential}} spectral energy scheme (DSE) for distribution line protection in a microgrid using a sparse Fourier kernel based fast time-frequency representation (SST). A matrix {{version of this}} scheme has been presented in reference [18] using intelligent frequency scaling methods which is almost 30 {{times faster than the}} proposed generalized S-Transform outlined in [17]. The method presented in this paper is immune to CT saturation as it generates a <b>tripping</b> <b>time</b> less than half cycle of the 50 or 60  Hz waveform. In order to ensure a differential protection scheme, the current (in each phase) at both ends of a distribution line are initially measured and processed so as to derive the respective average and differential components. Further, these components are passed through a change detection filter technique, whose output registers the occurrence of fault as well as the change detection point (CDP) depending upon a fault criterion. Subsequently, if CDP is registered for a particular phase, then half cycle data samples of the average and differential currents {{on either side of the}} CDP are passed through the proposed SST technique, which generates the differential current spectral energy (DSE) and the average current spectral energy (ASE). The occurrence of fault is verified if the maximum of DSE in the post fault region is higher than the ASE plus some bias (which is required to avoid misdetection and is tuned manually), and this ignites the fault location algorithm, based on the proposed SST technique. The proposed DSE technique as compared to conventional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and differential current protection scheme has a number of advantages, such as reduced computational complexity, reduced effect of bias setting for fault detection, quicker fault detection and classification and faster relay response time as well as better accuracy of fault location. The significance and accuracy of the proposed scheme has been verified extensively for a distributed generation (DFIG wind farm) based standard microgrid [19], subject to a large number of different operating conditions such as mode of operation of the microgrid (grid connected or islanded), type of fault ((single line to ground faults (L-g), double line to ground faults (LL-g), and triple line to ground fault (LLL-g), fault resistance, fault distance ratio, and the level of penetration of the DG, respectively, in the MATLAB/ Simulink environment. Finally the outputs as shown in the simulation and result section reveal that the proposed SST based DSE for the distribution line protection, is a robust and reliable mechanism, which is effective for both the grid connected and islanded mode of operation of the microgrid subject to various level of DG penetrations, respectively, and endowed with a fast detection time (less than half cycle), is vindicated as a potential candidate for the real time applications.|$|E

The {{characteristics of the}} following selected round trip landing missions are described: mission A (fast mission) with 120 -day total <b>trip</b> <b>time,</b> 0 -day stay-time, and 73, 000 -fps total mission Del V; mission B (opposition class) with 380 -day total <b>trip</b> <b>time,</b> 0 -day staytime, and 52, 000 -fps total mission Del V; and mission C (conjuction class) with 540 -day total <b>trip</b> <b>time,</b> 175 -day staytime, and 39, 000 -fps total mission Del V. A study of large-tank Agena, chemical propulsion stage (CPS), and nuclear stage was conducted. A payload of 5000 pounds was assumed. The propulsion requirements for mission A {{were found to be}} two large-tank Agenas and ten CPSs (or alternatively, two large-tank Agenas and five nuclear stages) while mission B required two large-tank Agenas and two CPSs. Mission C can be performed with one large-tank Agena and one CPS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Transit {{travel time}} and {{operating}} speed influence service attractiveness, operating cost, and system efficiency. The {{objective of this}} paper is to estimate the values of parameters that affect the total travel time for a particular bus route in Portland, Oregon. The Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon �TriMet � provides transit service in the three-county Portland metropolitan area. TriMet has implemented a Bus Dispatch System �BDS � as a part of its overall service control and management system. This BDS provides a rich array of archived data that were used in this study to develop the <b>trip</b> <b>time</b> model for the route under study. This <b>trip</b> <b>time</b> model provides heightened understanding of the factors that affect the <b>trip</b> <b>time</b> on the route. The value of the model was revealed when sensitivity analyses were performed using data from the studied route. This analysis concluded that improvements can be readily achieved after understanding the factors that affect total <b>trip</b> <b>time.</b> Finally, some conclusions and recommendations are presented and suggestions for additional research are provided...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Network {{coordinates}} {{allow to}} estimate the latency among {{a large number of}} hosts in a scalable way. Recently, Azureus, a popular implementation of BitTorrent, has implemented network coordinates. We have developed a crawler that allows us to obtain from the network coordinates over one hundred thousand peers running Azureus and to measure the network and application level round <b>trip</b> <b>times</b> to these peers. Our measurements confirm that network coordinates allow to correctly estimate the round <b>trip</b> <b>time</b> between two peers. Our measurements also show that the round <b>trip</b> <b>times</b> from our crawling host to a set of peers located in the same country can vary between a few tens of milliseconds to more than one second. This high variance is due to the large buffers in the ADSL access links, which can increase the round <b>trip</b> <b>time</b> by hundreds of milliseconds. As a consequence, network coordinates and round trip estimations in general cannot be used to select peers that are “nearby”, such as peers connected to the same ISP or located in the same country...|$|R
40|$|A {{parametric}} {{cost model}} for mercury ion propulsion modules is presented. A detailed {{work breakdown structure}} is included. Cost estimating relationships were developed for the individual subsystems and the nonhardware items (systems engineering, software, etc.). Solar array and power processor unit (PPU) costs are the significant cost drivers. Simplification of both of these subsystems through applications of advanced technology (lightweight solar arrays and high-efficiency, self-radiating PPUs) can reduce costs. Comparison of the performance and cost of several chemical propulsion systems with the Hg ion module are also presented. For outer-planet missions, advanced solar electric propulsion (ASEP) <b>trip</b> <b>times</b> and O 2 /H 2 propulsion <b>trip</b> <b>times</b> are comparable. A three-year <b>trip</b> <b>time</b> savings over the baselined NTO/MMH propulsion system is possible with ASEP...|$|R
