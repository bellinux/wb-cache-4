5|$|The 1s1 {{electron}} configuration of hydrogen, while superficially {{similar to that}} of the alkali metals (ns1), is unique because there is no 1p subshell. Hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron H+, or gain one to form the hydride ion H−. In the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals; in the latter case, the halogens, but the differences due to the lack of a 1p subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well. Group 14 is also a good fit in terms of <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>properties</b> such as ionisation energy and electron affinity, but makes chemical nonsense because hydrogen cannot be tetravalent. Thus none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory, although group 1 is the most common placement (if one is chosen) because the hydron is by far the most important of all monatomic hydrogen species, being the foundation of acid-base chemistry. As an example of hydrogen's unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual {{electron configuration}} and small size, the hydrogen ion is very small (radius around 150fm compared to the 50–220pm size of most other atoms and ions) and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules. Indeed, transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of acid-base chemistry. Also unique is hydrogen's ability to form hydrogen bonds, which are an effect of charge-transfer, electrostatic, and electron correlative contributing phenomena. While analogous lithium bonds are also known, they are mostly electrostatic. Nevertheless, hydrogen can take on the same structural role as the alkali metals in some molecular crystals, and has a close relationship with the lightest alkali metals (especially lithium).|$|E

The study is devoted to establish the correct <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>property</b> to be used in order to express the relationship between the change of internal energy and the temperature change. It is noted that, if the fluid is a perfect gas, this property must be identified with the specific heat at constant volume. If the fluid is a liquid, a definitely reliable approximation identifies this <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>property</b> with the specific heat at constant pressure.

25|$|There are {{two related}} {{definitions}} of entropy: the thermodynamic definition and the statistical mechanics definition. Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the classical thermodynamics viewpoint, {{the system is}} composed of very large numbers of constituents (atoms, molecules) {{and the state of}} the system is described by the average <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>properties</b> of those constituents; the details of the system's constituents are not directly considered, but their behavior is described by macroscopically averaged properties, e.g. temperature, pressure, entropy, heat capacity. The early classical definition of the properties of the system assumed equilibrium. The classical thermodynamic definition of entropy has more recently been extended into the area of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Later, the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>properties,</b> including entropy, were given an alternative definition in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system — modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, phonons, spins, etc.). The statistical mechanics description of the behavior of a system is necessary as the definition of the properties of a system using classical thermodynamics become an increasingly unreliable method of predicting the final state of a system that is subject to some process.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1960s, {{interpretation}} of the igneous rock record was largely qualitative. Ian Carmichael wanted to determine quantitative information such as the temperature and pressure of the magma when crystals were formed as well as dissolved water and oxygen content. For this, thermodynamic models were needed. Although attempts to apply rigorous thermodynamics to igneous processes go back to at least 1949, they were hindered {{by a lack of}} experimental data. Using tools such as a drop calorimeter and wet chemistry, Carmichael and colleagues set out to systematically explore <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>properties</b> of magma at high temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Filamentous carbon has <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>properties</b> {{that are}} {{different}} from those of graphite. This is partially {{due to the fact that}} the structure of filamentous carbon is more disordered than the structure of graphite. Other theories on the difference in properties include that the deviation is based on the formation of an intermediate phase of carbides. This theory was proposed by De Bokx et al. and Manning et al.. However, it is unlikely if the central metal atom is nickel because in that case, since carbides decompose at , and carbides formation was not observed during such a reaction.|$|E
40|$|While the <b>thermodynamic</b> nonequilibrium <b>properties</b> of {{nanoparticles}} {{are being}} extensively studied, the <b>thermodynamic</b> nonequilibrium <b>properties</b> of their counterpart: nanocavities, however, are less noticed. Here, we systematically review and comprehensively model the recently published {{results on the}} newly-found <b>thermodynamic</b> nonequilibriurn <b>properties</b> of nanocavities in covalently bound materials during energetic beam irradiation. We also review and model the <b>thermodynamic</b> nonequilibrium <b>properties</b> of nanoparticles. The review and modelling not only demonstrates the novel nonequilibriurn properties of such an open-volume nanostructure during external excitation but also gives a deep insight into the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of amorphous structures and {{the difference in the}} behaviours of defects in crystalline and in amorphous silicon. Especially, the review and modelling leads to two new concepts: anti-symmetry relation between a nanoparticle and a nanocavity energetic beam induced-soft mode and lattice instability in condensed matter which reveals that structure of a condensed matter would be unstable not only at nanosize scale but also at a nanotime scale in general. It is also reveals that such nanoinstabilities would be more pronounced in an amorphous structure than in a crystalline structure...|$|R

25|$|Vapor isotope effects {{occur for}} protium, deuterium, and tritium, because each isotope has {{different}} <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>properties</b> in the liquid and gaseous phases. For water molecules, the condensed phase is more enriched while the vapor is more depleted. For example, rain condensing from a cloud will be {{heavier than the}} vapor starting point. Generally, the large variations in deuterium concentrations of water are from the fractionations between liquid, vapor, and solid reservoirs. In contrast to the fractionation pattern of water, non-polar molecules like oils and lipids, have gaseous counterparts enriched with deuterium relative to the liquid. This {{is thought to be}} associated with the polarity from hydrogen bonding in water that does not interfere in long-chain hydrocarbons.|$|E
25|$|The hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) {{are less}} stable {{in the lower}} atmosphere, {{enabling}} them to break down before reaching the ozone layer. Nevertheless, a significant fraction of the HCFCs do break down in the stratosphere and they have contributed to more chlorine buildup there than originally predicted. Later alternatives lacking the chlorine, the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) have an even shorter lifetimes in the lower atmosphere. One of these compounds, HFC-134a, is now used in place of CFC-12 in automobile air conditioners. Hydrocarbon refrigerants (a propane/isobutane blend) are also used extensively in mobile air conditioning systems in Australia, the USA and many other countries, as they have excellent <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>properties</b> and perform particularly well in high ambient temperatures.|$|E
25|$|In {{the branch}} of physics called {{statistical}} mechanics, entropy {{is a measure of}} the randomness or disorder of a physical system. This concept was studied in the 1870s by the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann, who showed that the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>properties</b> of a gas could be derived from the combined properties of its many constituent molecules. Boltzmann argued that by averaging the behaviors of all the different molecules in a gas, one can understand macroscopic properties such as volume, temperature, and pressure. In addition, this perspective led him to give a precise definition of entropy as the natural logarithm of the number of different states of the molecules (also called microstates) that give rise to the same macroscopic features.|$|E
