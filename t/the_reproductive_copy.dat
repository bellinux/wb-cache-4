40|$|There is robust {{evidence}} from epidemiological studies that {{the offspring of}} older fathers have {{an increased risk of}} neurodevelopmental disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism. The authors present a novel mechanism that may contribute to this association. Because the male germ cell undergoes many more cell divisions across <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> age range, <b>copy</b> errors taking place in the paternal germline are associated with de novo mutations in the offspring of older men. Recently it has been recognized that somatic mutations in male germ cells that modify proliferation through dysregulation of the RAS protein pathway can lead to within-testis expansion of mutant clonal lines. First identified in association with rare disorders related to paternal age (e. g., Apert syndrome, achondroplasia), this process is known as "selfish spermatogonial selection. " This mechanism favors propagation of germ cells carrying pathogenic mutations, increasingly skews the mutational profile of sperm as men age, and enriches de novo mutations in the offspring of older fathers that preferentially affect specific cellular signaling pathways. This mechanism not only offers a parsimonious explanation for the association between advanced paternal age and various neurodevelopmental disorders but also provides insights into the genetic architecture (role of de novo mutations), neurobiological correlates (altered cell cycle), and some epidemiological features of these disorders. The authors outline hypotheses to test this model. Given the secular changes for delayed parenthood in most societies, this hypothesis has important public health implications...|$|R

A key variable in such models is <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> number R.

40|$|Abstract. We {{formulate}} differential susceptibility and differential infectivity {{models for}} disease transmission in this paper. The susceptibles {{are divided into}} n groups based on their susceptibilities, and the infectives are divided into m groups according to their infectivities. Both the standard incidence and the bilinear incidence are considered for different diseases. We obtain explicit formulas for <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> number. We define <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> number for each subgroup. Then <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> number for <b>the</b> entire population is a weighted average of those <b>reproductive</b> numbers for <b>the</b> subgroups. The formulas for <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> number are derived from the local stability of the infection-free equilibrium. We show that the infection-free equilibrium is globally stable as <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> number is less than one for the models with the bilinear incidence or with the standard incidence but no disease-induced death. We then show that if <b>the</b> <b>reproductive</b> number is greater than one, there exists a unique endemic equilibrium for these models. For the general cases of the models with the standard incidence and death, conditions are derived to ensure {{the uniqueness of the}} endemic equilibrium. We also provide numerical examples to demonstrate that the unique endemic equilibrium is asymptotically stable if it exists. In honor of Professor Zhien Ma’s 70 th birthday 1. Introduction.
