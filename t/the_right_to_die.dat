Frank Schaeffer and his associate, Jim Buchfuehrer provided a private, five-hour screening of Whatever Happened to the Human Race? to Jack Kemp and wife Joanne in their home that, according to Frank Schaeffer's account of the late evening and early morning event in his book Crazy for God, led to both the Schaeffers and Koop obtaining [...] "...access to everyone in the Republican Party".

500|$|Protection of {{life and}} {{personal}} liberty is also stated under right to life and personal liberty. Article 21 declares that no citizen can be denied his life and liberty except by law. This means that a person's life and personal liberty can be disputed only if that person has committed a crime. However, {{the right to life}} does not include <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> and hence, suicide or an attempt thereof, is an offence. (Attempted suicide being interpreted as a crime has seen many debates. The Supreme Court of India gave a landmark ruling in 1994. The court repealed section 309 of the Indian penal code, under which people attempting suicide could face prosecution and prison terms of up to one year. In 1996 however another Supreme Court ruling nullified the earlier one.) [...] "Personal liberty" [...] includes all the freedoms which are not included in Article 19 (that is, the six freedoms).

2500|$|One of {{the most}} basic human rights is the right to live, and thus, {{preserve}} one's life. Yet one must also consider <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>die,</b> and thus, end one's life. Often, religious values of varying traditions influence this issue. Terms like [...] "mercy killing" [...] and [...] "assisted suicide" [...] are frequently used to describe this process. Proponents of euthanasia claim that it is particularly necessary for patients suffering from a terminal illness. However, opponents of a self-chosen death purport that it is not only immoral, but wholly against the pillars of reason.|$|E

Episodes usually end with the verdict being read by the jury foreperson and a shot of both the winning and losing parties. The scene then shifts to the District Attorney's office, where the team is leaving the office to go home while contemplating either the true guilt of the accused, the defense scenarios that were used, or the moral or ethical issue that was central to the episode.|$|E

60|$|And in {{that same}} crucible, too, Anthony Wilding's nature had {{undergone}} a transmutation; his love for Ruth had been purified of that base alloy of desire which had driven him into the unworthiness of making her his own at all costs; there was no carnal grossness in his present passion; it was pure as a religion--the love that takes no account of self, the love that makes for joyous and grateful martyrdom. And a joyous and grateful martyr would Anthony Wilding have been could he have thought that his death would bring her happiness or peace. In such a faith as that he had marched--or so he thought blithely to his end, and the smile on his lips had been less wistful than it was. Thinking of the agony {{in which he had}} left her, he almost came to wish--so pure was his love grown--that he had not conquered. The joy that at first was his was now all dashed. His death would cause her pain. His death! O God! It is an easy thing to be a martyr; but this was not martyrdom; having done what he had done he had not <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> The last vestige of the smile that he had worn faded from his tight-pressed lips tight-pressed as though to endure some physical suffering.

6000|$|Now {{it is an}} {{excellent}} thing to triumph in {{the victory of the}} new order and the passing away of the old; but {{if you happen to be}} part of the old order yourself, you must none the less fight for your life. It seems hardly possible that the British army at the battle of Waterloo did not include at least one Englishman intelligent enough to hope, for the sake of his country and humanity, that Napoleon might defeat the allied sovereigns; but such an Englishman would kill a French cuirassier rather than be killed by him just as energetically as the silliest soldier, ever encouraged by people who ought to know better, to call his ignorance, ferocity and folly, patriotism and duty. Outworn life may have become mere error; but it still claims <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> a natural death, and will raise its hand against the millennium itself in self-defence if it tries to come by the short cut of murder. Wotan finds this out when he comes face to face with Siegfried, who is brought to a standstill at the foot of the mountain by the disappearance of the bird. Meeting the Wanderer there, he asks him the way to the mountain where a woman sleeps surrounded by fire. The Wanderer questions him, and extracts his story from him, breaking into fatherly delight when Siegfried, describing the mending of the sword, remarks that all he knew about the business was that the broken bits of Nothung would be of no use to him unless he made a new sword out of them right over again from the beginning. But the Wanderer's interest is by no means reciprocated by Siegfried. His majesty and elderly dignity are thrown away on the young anarchist, who, unwilling to waste time talking, bluntly bids him either show him the way to the mountain, or else [...] "shut his muzzle." [...] Wotan is a little hurt. [...] "Patience, my lad," [...] he says: [...] "if you were an old man I should treat you with respect." [...] "That would be a precious notion," [...] says Siegfried. [...] "All my life long I was bothered and hampered by an old man until I swept him out of my way. I will sweep you in the same fashion if you don't let me pass. Why do you wear such a big hat; and what has happened to one of your eyes? Was it knocked out by somebody whose way you obstructed?" [...] To which Wotan replies allegorically that the eye that is gone--the eye that his marriage with Fricka cost him--is now looking at him out of Siegfried's head. At this, Siegfried gives up the Wanderer as a lunatic, and renews his threats of personal violence. Then Wotan throws off the mask of the Wanderer; uplifts the world-governing spear; and puts forth all his divine awe and grandeur as the guardian of the mountain, round the crest of which the fires of Loki now break into a red background for the majesty of the god. But all this is lost on Siegfried Bakoonin. [...] "Aha!" [...] he cries, as the spear is levelled against his breast: [...] "I have found my father's foe"; and the spear falls in two pieces under the stroke of Nothung. [...] "Up then," [...] says Wotan: [...] "I cannot withhold you," [...] and disappears forever from the eye of man. The fires roll down the mountain; but Siegfried goes at them as exultantly as he went at the forging of the sword or the heart of the dragon, and shoulders his way through them, joyously sounding his horn to the accompaniment of their crackling and seething. And never a hair of his head is singed. Those frightful flames which have scared mankind for centuries from the Truth, have not heat enough in them to make a child shut its eyes. They are mere phantasmagoria, highly creditable to Loki's imaginative stage-management; but nothing ever has perished or will perish eternally in them except the Churches which have been so poor and faithless as to trade for their power on the lies of a romancer.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> term <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> {{has been}} {{interpreted}} {{in a number of}} ways, including issues of suicide, passive euthanasia, active euthanasia, assisted suicide, and physician-assisted suicide. As health of citizens is considered a police power left for individual states to regulate, it was not until 1997 that the US Supreme Court made a ruling on the issue of assisted suicide and one's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>die.</b> In 1997 <b>the</b> Supreme Court heard two appeals arguing that New York and Washington statutes that made physician assisted suicide a felony violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In a unanimous vote, the Court held that there was no constitutional <b>right</b> <b>to</b> physician assisted suicide and upheld state bans on assisted suicide. While in New York this has maintained statutes banning physician assisted suicide, the Court's decision also left it open for other states to decide whether they would allow physician assisted suicide or not.|$|R
