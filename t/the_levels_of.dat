40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to know a significant correlation between <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> stress with <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> aggresive behaviour in unemployed housewives. This research is a correlation research. The population of this research were the unemployed housewives in Surabaya, with 100 person as the sample.

The collecting data method was questionnaire to expose <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> stress and <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> aggresive behaviour in unemployed housewives. The data analysis used Chi-Square (χ 2) analysis.

5|$|Although Gert's center {{remained}} off {{the coast}} of Costa Rica, its large circulation produced brisk winds and heavy rainfall across the country. A local weather station recorded 13.1inches (332mm) of rain during the storm. Geologically, the hardest-hit regions consisted of sedimentary layers with poor hydraulic conductivity and were therefore prone to soil saturation. The initial rainfall raised <b>the</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> many rivers, exacerbating the flood threat. The imminent overflow of the Tempisque River prompted wide-scale evacuations, though the river crested gradually without major consequence. After hours of prolonged rainfall, many Pacific regions such as Quepos, Pérez Zeledón, and Osa experienced flooding and landslides, which inflicted moderate damage to roads and bridges.|$|E

40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} found a {{relationship}} between early numeracy and language.

Aim: The first aim {{of this study is to}} re-investigate the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> early numeracy and <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> language of children attending nursery school in the Netherlands. The second aim is to investigate the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> language subskills and <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> early numeracy. Furthermore, the subskills of language are individually examined to determine which subskill is the best predictor for early numeracy. Method: <b>The</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> early numeracy was assessed with the UGT-R and <b>the</b> total <b>level</b> <b>of</b> language, as well as the subskills of language, was assessed with the CITO Taal voor Kleuters. Using a Pearson’s correlation test the relationship between these variables is examined. Multiple regression was used to examine which variable is the strongest predictor of early numeracy. Results: The results show a significant positive relationship between <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> early numeracy with <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> language. Significant positive relationships are also found for all the subskills <b>of</b> language with <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> early numeracy. <b>The</b> subskill phoneme and rhyme is the strongest predictor for <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> early numeracy. Conclusion: A positive relationship is found between <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> early numeracy and <b>the</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> language and <b>the</b> subskills of language.
