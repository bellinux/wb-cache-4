Sociological and cultural aspects of autism have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that autism is simply another way of being.|$|E

5|$|I will confess {{up front}} that I love Anonymous, {{but not because}} I think they're the heroes. Like Alan Moore's {{character}} V who inspired Anonymous to adopt the Guy Fawkes mask as an icon and fashion item, you're never quite sure if Anonymous is the hero or antihero. The trickster is attracted to change {{and the need for}} change, and that's where Anonymous goes. But they are not your personal army – that's Rule 44 – yes, there are rules. And when they do something, it never goes quite as planned. <b>The</b> <b>internet</b> <b>has</b> no neat endings.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} decade of the 21st century some groups reached {{mainstream}} popularity. There are Christian metal bands that perform virtually every subgenre of metal. The Christian metal movement has spread worldwide since it emerged in the early 1980s, and there are now hundreds of active Christian metal bands. Inspired by the metal revival, many 1980s bands have made comebacks including Saint, Bloodgood and Stryper. In October 2004, Doug Van Pelt brought Heaven's Metal back as its own fanzine. <b>The</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>has</b> had a significant role on the revival of Christian metal as well. Many websites and online communities are dedicated to discussions about Christian metal's music, events, and bands.|$|E
5|$|People {{identifying}} with Asperger syndrome may refer to themselves in casual conversation as aspies (a term first used in print by Liane Holliday Willey in 1999). The word neurotypical (abbreviated NT) describes a person whose neurological development and state are typical, {{and is often}} used to refer to non-autistic people. <b>The</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>has</b> allowed individuals with AS {{to communicate with each other}} in a way that was not previously possible because of their rarity and geographic dispersal, forming a subculture composed of people with Asperger's. Internet sites like Wrong Planet have made it easier for individuals to connect.|$|E
5|$|The Internet is a {{worldwide}} network {{of computers and}} computer networks that {{communicate with each other}} using the Internet Protocol. Any computer on <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>has</b> a unique IP address that can be used by other computers to route information to it. Hence, any computer on the Internet can send a message to any other computer using its IP address. These messages carry with them the originating computer's IP address allowing for two-way communication. The Internet is thus an exchange of messages between computers.|$|E

Research on the social engagement effect is mixed. One study by Wellman finding that [...] "33% of Internet users said that <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>had</b> improved their connections to friends 'a lot', and 23% said it had increased {{the quality of their}} communication with family members by a similar amount. Young people in particular took advantage of the social side of <b>the</b> <b>Internet.</b> Nearly half (49%) of the 18- to 29-year-olds said that <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>had</b> improved their connections to friends a lot. On the other hand, 19% of employed Internet users said that <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>had</b> increased <b>the</b> amount of time they spent working in home" [...] (Lee, Leung, Lo, Xiong, & Wu p. 377 & 378).|$|R

5|$|The {{media has}} {{historically}} come under {{varying degrees of}} pressure over time to censor their criticism of the government. Reporters are occasionally threatened or harassed and media outlets are periodically forced to close. Accusations of media censorship have increased since 2009 due to the alleged intensification of restrictions on political criticism.

5|$|The rise of <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> <b>has</b> {{resulted}} in many broadcasters ceasing their shortwave transmissions {{in favor of}} broadcasting over the world wide web. When BBC World Service discontinued service to Europe, North America, Australasia, and the Caribbean, it generated many protests and activist {{groups such as the}} Coalition to Save the BBC World Service. In the US, the shifting of resources from shortwave to Internet and television by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which oversees U.S. international broadcasting, has also {{resulted in}} reduced broadcasting hours in the English language. Radio Netherlands, Voice of Russia (formerly Radio Moscow), Radio Canada International and Radio Australia are among the prominent broadcasters who have ceased broadcasting on shortwave. Although most of the prominent broadcasters continue to scale back their analog shortwave transmissions or completely terminate them, shortwave is still very common and active in developing regions such as parts of Africa.|$|E

After being fired by Dwight, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) bought a bar and Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) started a career as an author in New York City. Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) has moved to Poland. Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) had faked his death but was then revealed to be a wanted fugitive, so Dwight replaced him with former employee Devon White (Devon Abner). Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) is preparing to run for a State Senate seat and is now Phillip's godfather.

5|$|The {{craft of}} making reborn dolls {{began in the}} United States in the late 1990s. Reborning follows a long {{tradition}} of collectors, artists, and manufacturers restoring and enhancing dolls in order to portray more realism. <b>The</b> <b>internet</b> <b>has</b> allowed doll artists and collectors to create an online society focused on reborn dolls. In 2002, the first reborn was offered on eBay. This has expanded the reborn market allowing artists to open online stores which function figuratively as nurseries. The niche market for the dolls began with doll collectors who admired the superior lifelike accuracy of the doll. The market quickly reached those who wanted to use the doll as an emotional outlet, either to mother or for therapeutic purposes. Mass media coverage has helped to develop the phenomenon in other countries. Reborning enjoys popularity in the United Kingdom and Australia, but has also reached Canada, the rest of Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Doll manufacturers have also taken advantage of the trend and sell supplies, tools, and accessories catering to reborn followers. This has allowed reborners to invent new techniques causing the dolls to become increasingly realistic over time. Magazines, books, organizations, and conventions dedicated to reborn dolls have been started {{as a result of this}} popularity.|$|E
