2500|$|The {{principal}} {{difference between}} Lojban and Loglan {{is one of}} lexicon. The words for Lojban {{were made by the}} same principles as those for Loglan; that is, candidate forms were chosen according to how many sounds they had in common with their equivalent {{in some of the most}} commonly spoken languages on Earth, which was then multiplied by the number of speakers of the languages with which the words had letters in common. The difference with the Lojban remake of the root words was that the weighting was updated to reflect the actual numbers of speakers for the languages. This resulted in word forms that had fewer sounds taken from English, and more sounds <b>taken</b> from <b>Chinese.</b> <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> the Loglan word norma is equivalent to the Lojban word [...] (cf. Chinese 常, pinyin cháng), both meaning [...] "normal".|$|R
5000|$|The {{closed set}} of five-letter words {{was the first}} part of the {{vocabulary}} to be remade. The words for Lojban were made by the same principles as those for Loglan; that is, candidate forms were chosen according to how many sounds they had in common with their equivalent in some of the most commonly spoken languages on Earth, which was then multiplied by the number of speakers of the languages with which the words had letters in common.

5000|$|Some Nepalese in Hong Kong {{are facing}} {{difficulties}} {{because of their}} culture {{is different from the}} local <b>Chinese.</b> <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> the police check their HKID cards usually simply due to misunderstanding of language and cultural difference. [...] This would cause discomfort and inconvenience to the Nepalese.|$|R

5000|$|Although {{languages}} can {{generally be}} classified as [...] "verb-framed"/"satellite-framed", not everything works exactly in that way. First, languages can use both strategies, {{as is the case}} with the Latinate verbs mentioned supra for English: [...] "enter", [...] "ascend", [...] "exit". The existence of equipollently-framed languages in which both manner and path are expressed in verbs has been pointed out (Slobin 2004). It could be true of <b>Chinese,</b> <b>for</b> <b>instance.</b>|$|R
50|$|Change as {{a result}} of contact is often one-sided. <b>Chinese,</b> <b>for</b> <b>instance,</b> has had a {{profound}} effect on the development of Japanese, but Chinese remains relatively free of Japanese influence other than some modern terms that were reborrowed after they were coined in Japan and based on Chinese forms and using Chinese characters. In India, Hindi and other native languages have been influenced by English, and loanwords from English are part of everyday vocabulary.|$|R
50|$|While the {{traditional}} Mongolian script often tends {{to highlight the}} original Chinese pronunciation, the Cyrillic orthography, which spells words as they are pronounced, obscures the connection with <b>Chinese.</b> <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> the syllable-final н in the Cyrillic script is pronounced /ŋ/ in Mongolia, thus neutralising the earlier distinction between /ŋ/ and /n/ in this position and further obscuring the regularity of relationships with Chinese. This distinction between /ŋ/ and /n/ is retained in Inner Mongolian dialects.|$|R
30|$|Chinese is canonically an SVO language. 1 Sun and Givón’s (1985) {{survey of}} {{contemporary}} written and spoken Mandarin Chinese reports that over 90 % {{of the direct}} objects occurred in the canonical position after the verb. At the same time, the non-canonical SOV and OSV word orders, with bare objects being placed in the sentence-medial or sentence-initial positions, are also possible in <b>Chinese.</b> <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> 2 a and 2 b are the SOV and OSV variants of 1, with their propositional meanings being identical to 1.|$|R
50|$|After Singapore's {{independence}} in 1965, {{there was a}} general language shift in the country's interracial lingua franca from Malay to English, as English was chosen as the first language for the country. Among the Chinese community in Singapore, there was a language shift from the various dialects of Chinese to Mandarin <b>Chinese.</b> <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> Mandarin <b>Chinese</b> has replaced Singaporean Hokkien as the lingua franca of Chinese community in Singapore today. There has been a general language attrition in the use of Chinese other than Mandarin Chinese, especially amongst the younger segments of the Singaporean population.|$|R
5000|$|Owing to its {{cold weather}} and its close {{proximity}} to Tibet, the lifestyle of Prinmi-speaking Tibetans closely resembles {{to that of the}} Tibetans. On the other hand, the Pumi living in Yunnan have adopted a liftstyle {{similar to that of the}} <b>Chinese.</b> <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> rice has become the staple food for most Pumi. Even in villages where the climate is too cold to grow the crop, many will trade rice for potatoes at the market place. A variety of vegetables and fruits such as the Chinese cabbage, beans, eggplant and melons serve as supplements.|$|R
5000|$|Like other non-Chinese terms, Manchu {{names are}} often {{transcribed}} into Chinese in a chaotic pattern {{since they were}} <b>taken</b> from <b>Chinese</b> sources. It is difficult to reconstruct original Manchu spellings from their Chinese transcription. Sometimes the first syllable of a Manchu given name is misinterpreted as a <b>Chinese</b> surname. <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> the Manchu official Tulišen, who wrote a famous travel record, is mistaken <b>for</b> a <b>Chinese</b> man named [...] "Tu Lishen." ...|$|R
50|$|As foreign {{missionaries and}} {{businessmen}} gained {{the right to}} hold property in China from the unequal treaties, the local headmen could be caught between them and their superiors in the <b>Chinese</b> hierarchy, <b>for</b> <b>instance</b> during {{the construction of the}} Woosung Road.|$|R

5000|$|Like other {{varieties}} of Southern Chinese, Wu Chinese retains some archaic vocabulary from Classical Chinese, Middle Chinese, and Old <b>Chinese.</b> <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> <b>for</b> [...] "to speak" [...] or [...] "speaking", Wu dialects, {{with the exception}} of Hangzhou dialect, use góng (Simplified Chinese: 讲; Traditional Chinese: 講), whereas Mandarin uses shuō (Simplified Chinese: 说; Traditional Chinese: 說). Furthermore, in Guangfeng and Yushan counties of Jiangxi province, 曰 [...] or 'yuē', is generally preferred over its Mandarin counterpart. In Shangrao county of Jiangxi province, Simplified Chinese: 话 Traditional Chinese: 話 pinyin: Huà/ is preferred over the spoke Mandarin version of the word for [...] "to speak" [...] or [...] "speaking".|$|R
5000|$|The German sinologist Rudolf G. Wagner (1973, {{cited by}} Sailey 1978:431-432) speculated that hanshisan, which was {{associated}} with [...] "greater mental awareness and perceptiveness", was used by some <b>Chinese</b> Buddhists. <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> Huiyi (慧義, 372-444) who infamously ingratiated himself with Emperor Wu of Liu Song and General Fan Tai.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, an {{offshoot}} of SMC is the translation to Hanyu Pinyin of certain terms which originated from southern <b>Chinese</b> varieties. <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> dim sum is often known as diǎn xīn in Singapore's English-language media, though this is largely a matter of style, and most Singaporeans will {{refer to it as}} dim sum when speaking English.|$|R
30|$|Most studies discuss {{different}} constructions separately. However, when studying semantic {{relations between}} CPCs in different constructions, {{it is not}} necessary to regard them as distinct phenomena. Zhou and Xue (2012) described four characteristics which blur the boundary between discourse construction and serial verb construction. They are as follows: (i) semi-colon is not always used to separate the sentences; (ii) in most of the cases, no explicit discourse connectives are used to denote the discourse relations; (iii) no inflectional clues to differentiate free adjuncts and main clauses; and (iv) both subject and object can be dropped in <b>Chinese.</b> <b>For</b> <b>instance</b> in (2), there are no essential reasons we need to separate (a) and (b) into different categories of discourse construction and serial verb construction.|$|R
50|$|The author {{also uses}} many Chinese terms (normally italicized) {{to refer to}} common things or people, {{in order to make}} them look more typical of <b>Chinese</b> culture. <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> foreigners are often {{referred}} to as waiguoren, girls are called xiaojies, porters are called stick-stick soldiers (translated literally from the Sichuanese term 棒棒军 bàngbàngjūn), and so on.|$|R
5000|$|Singapore {{also held}} Getai during {{traditional}} <b>Chinese</b> festivals, <b>for</b> <b>instance</b> Hungry Ghost Festivals. During the Getai event, {{it is common}} to speak a number of Chinese varieties, including Hokkien, Teochew and Cantonese. During the 1960s, Hokkien Song was particularly popular. The Singapore Hokkien star Chen Jin Lang 陳金浪 was once the main compere and singer during the Hungry ghost festival. <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> his famous song [...] "10 levels of Hade" [...] 《十殿閻君》 was especially popular.|$|R
5000|$|WeChat [...] is {{a social}} mobile {{application}} with voice and text messaging, timeline, and several social features like drift a bottle. It {{is the most popular}} social mobile application in China and some overseas <b>Chinese</b> communities, <b>for</b> <b>instance,</b> Malaysia. WeChat would like to have expanded more abroad but, as of 2017, WeChat was unsuccessful in penetrating major international markets outside of China.|$|R
50|$|Bernhard Karlgren {{considered}} Jingdian Shiwen and the 601 Qieyun rime dictionary as the {{two primary}} sources <b>for</b> reconstructing Middle <b>Chinese.</b> Many studies in <b>Chinese</b> historical linguistics (<b>for</b> <b>instance,</b> see References) use the important Jingdian Shiwen data.|$|R
50|$|The 27 {{percent of}} the urban labor force that was {{employed}} in collectively owned enterprises earned less on average than workers in state-owned units. The income of workers in collectively owned enterprises consisted of {{a share of the}} profit earned by the enterprise. Most such enterprises were small, had little capital, and did not earn large profits. Many were engaged in traditional services, handicrafts, or small-scale, part-time assembly work. In 1985 workers in urban collective units earned an average annual income of ¥968. In the more open commercial environment of the 1980s, a small but significant number of people earned incomes much larger than those in regular state-owned and collectively owned units. Employees of enterprises run by overseas <b>Chinese,</b> <b>for</b> <b>instance,</b> earned an average of ¥2,437 in 1985, over twice the average income of workers in state-owned units.|$|R
50|$|The ideal {{color of}} the machine may depend on the clientele. In retail {{locations}} frequented by children, an eye-catching red or yellow may be best. <b>Chinese</b> restaurants, <b>for</b> <b>instance,</b> typically favor red. In offices where adults are the customers, a more subdued blue, grey, silver, or black may be better. If a location has a color coordination, it may be good to keep with the color coordination.|$|R
5000|$|Wújí ( [...] ; {{literally}} [...] "without ridgepole") originally meant [...] "ultimate; boundless; infinite" [...] in Warring States period (476-221 BCE) Taoist classics, {{but came}} {{to mean the}} [...] "primordial universe" [...] prior to the Taiji 太極 [...] "Supreme Ultimate" [...] in Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE) Neo-Confucianist cosmology. Wuji is also a proper noun in Modern Standard <b>Chinese</b> usage; <b>for</b> <b>instance,</b> Wuji County in Hebei.|$|R
2500|$|Many Hong Kong {{people use}} both Cantonese and English, or [...] "code-switch", {{in the same}} {{sentence}} when speaking. For example, [...] " [...] make sense!" [...] ("Wow, it does not make sense!"). The code-switching can freely mix English words and <b>Chinese</b> grammar, <b>for</b> <b>instance</b> [...] " [...] un [...] understand?" [...] ("Do you understand?") which follows the Chinese grammar syntax 'verb - [...] - verb' to ask [...] "Do you (verb)?".|$|R
50|$|Use of {{the signs}} {{corresponds}} {{to the use of}} numbers in the <b>Chinese</b> language. <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> the sign <b>for</b> five just as easily means fifty. A two followed by a six, using a single hand only, could mean 260 or 2600 etc. besides twenty-six. These signs also commonly refer to days of the week, starting from Monday, as well as months of the year, whose names in Chinese are enumerations.|$|R

50|$|Other copulas {{show more}} resemblances to pronouns. That {{is the case}} <b>for</b> Classical <b>Chinese</b> and Guarani, <b>for</b> <b>instance.</b> In highly {{synthetic}} languages, copulas are often suffixes, attached to a noun, but they may still behave otherwise like ordinary verbs: -u- in Inuit languages.|$|R
25|$|Pierrebourg and Juneau-Katsuya {{also raised}} {{concerns}} over ties between Confucius Institute administrators and large state-run <b>Chinese</b> companies. <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> {{they point to}} the Confucius Institute at the University of Texas at Dallas, where one of the top officials is also vice-president of Huawei, a Chinese telecom company the U.S. government regards as a national security threat, and which has been accused of industrial espionage, though an extensive security review found no clear evidence of spying.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{pointed out that the}} current policy of copying existing, [...] "old", western cities or {{established}} Asian cities such as Singapore means missing out on opportunities for radical new thinking regarding city planning that are arising from the unprecedented speed of the current <b>Chinese</b> urbanization. <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> {{it has been suggested that}} putting the entire road network underground can be a viable solution when dense cities are being built [...] "from scratch".|$|R
40|$|Most word {{embedding}} methods take a word as a ba-sic unit and learn embeddings according to words’ external contexts, ignoring the internal structures of words. However, in some languages such as Chi-nese, a word is usually composed of several char-acters and contains rich internal information. The semantic {{meaning of a}} word is also related to the meanings of its composing characters. Hence, we <b>take</b> <b>Chinese</b> <b>for</b> example, and present a character-enhanced {{word embedding}} model (CWE). In order to address the issues of character ambiguity and non-compositional words, we propose multiple-prototype character embeddings and an effective word selection method. We evaluate the effective-ness of CWE on word relatedness computation and analogical reasoning. The results show that CWE outperforms other baseline methods which ignore internal character information. The codes and data can be accessed fro...|$|R
5000|$|The pentatonic wusheng [...] "Five Notes" [...] {{were the}} Chinese {{musicology}} correlation of the wǔxíng 五行 [...] "Five Phases; Five Elements" [...] theory about mù 木 [...] "Wood", huǒ 火 [...] "Fire", tǔ 土 [...] "Earth", jīn 金 [...] "Metal"), and shuǐ 水 [...] "Water". The Five Phases/Elements cosmological system has numerous corresponding sets of five (Needham and Wang 1954: 263-264). Many sets seem plausible, {{such as the}} wǔsè 五色 [...] "Five Colors (blue/green, yellow, red, white, black)"—corresponding to Berlin and Kay's basic color terms hypothesis. Some less plausible Five Phases sets are correlated with naturally occurring sets of four, such as the four tones in <b>Chinese.</b> <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> the cardinal directions and seasons are stretched into the wǔfāng 五方 [...] "Five Directions (north, south, east, west, and center)" [...] and wǔshí 五時 [...] "Five Seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter, and the 6th month an intercalcary)" [...] (Needham and Wang 1954: 250).|$|R
5000|$|The first Japanese {{books were}} mainly written with the Man'yōgana system, a rebus-like {{transcription}} that phonetically uses kanji [...] "Chinese characters" [...] to represent Japanese phonemes. <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> using <b>Chinese</b> jiā ( [...] "add"), which was pronounced ka in Japanese, {{to write the}} Japanese mora ka. Irregularities within this awkward system led Japanese scribes to develop phonetically regular syllabaries. In many cases, the new kana were graphic simplifications of <b>Chinese</b> characters. <b>For</b> <b>instance,</b> ka is written [...] in hiragana and [...] in katakana, both of which derive from the Man'yōgana 加 character.|$|R
5000|$|However, at that time, {{there was}} no colloquial Standard Mandarin {{which could be used}} as a basis for {{learning}} Mandarin. In addition, during the early 1900s, most Mandarin teachers in Singapore came from southern parts of China, and had strong southern Chinese accents. Thus, the pronunciations in Singaporean Mandarin were under heavy influence from China's southern <b>Chinese</b> dialects; <b>for</b> <b>instance,</b> there were no erhua (...) , light tone (...) , and no sentences had the heavy or light accent (...) etc.|$|R
