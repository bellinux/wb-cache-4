5|$|Fall Out Boy is an American {{rock band}} formed in Wilmette, Illinois, {{a suburb of}} Chicago, in 2001. The band {{consists}} of lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist Patrick Stump, bassist Pete Wentz, lead guitarist Joe Trohman, and drummer Andy Hurley. The band originated from Chicago's hardcore punk scene, with which all members were involved at one point. The group was formed by Wentz and Trohman as a pop punk side project of the members' respective hardcore bands, and Stump joined shortly thereafter. The group went through a succession of drummers before landing Hurley and recording the group's debut album, <b>Take</b> <b>This</b> <b>to</b> Your Grave (2003). The album became an underground success and helped the band gain a dedicated fanbase through heavy touring, {{as well as some}} moderate commercial success. <b>Take</b> <b>This</b> <b>to</b> Your Grave has commonly been cited as an influential blueprint for pop punk music in the 2000s.|$|E

He reprimanded Buffalo for not stopping the continuing sporadic warfare between the Ojibwa and Dakota. Buffalo replied that he was unable to stop the young men of Lac Courte Oreilles, St. Croix, Lac du Flambeau or other bands beyond La Pointe from going against the Dakota. Historians <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> mean that while he was regarded as the head spokesman of the Ojibwa in Wisconsin, he could not control the day-to-day affairs of all the bands, which were highly decentralized, particularly about warfare. Buffalo also said that, unlike the British before the War of 1812, the U.S. Government had not done enough to help maintain the peace among the tribes.|$|E

Entering Devore's hotel room, Just discovers Devore dead in the bathroom, apparently having slipped in the shower and hit {{his head on the}} faucets. Others <b>take</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> be a tragic accident and nothing more, but Just suspects murder, based on Devore's compulsive tidiness and the disarray in which Just found the room.

500|$|Evan Lucy of Alternative Press {{gave the}} album a mixed review, feeling [...] "some songs feel ripped from Fall Out Boy's <b>Take</b> <b>This</b> <b>to</b> Your Grave," [...] but praised songs which were less {{adherent}} to pop punk, namely [...] "Tigers and Sharks" [...] and [...] "Always Attract". AllMusic reviewer Jon O'Brien criticised the album's sound, describing {{it as an}} album which was more mature than a Busted record, but not as heavy as Fightstar's music. O'Brien stated that the band followed a [...] "well-worn formula" [...] of emo pop on Take Off Your Colours. However, another AllMusic reviewer, Jason Birchmeier, later regarded Take Off Your Colours as an [...] "impressive debut album" [...] which cemented the group [...] "as one of England's hottest up-and-coming rock bands". The Guardian described the band's sound to be [...] "the UK's answer to Fall Out Boy," [...] with reviewer Emma Johnston choosing [...] "Jealous Minds Think Alike" [...] as a highlight.|$|E
500|$|After {{taking a}} two-month-long break {{following}} the band’s Black Clouds and Underdogs tour in {{promotion of the}} band's 2005 album From Under the Cork Tree, Fall Out Boy returned to the studio to begin work on a follow-up effort. [...] The band began writing songs for the new album while touring, and intended to quickly make a new album {{in order to keep}} momentum in the wake of its breakthrough success. In early 2007, the group released its third studio album, Infinity on High, which was the band's second release on major label Island. The album marked a departure in Fall Out Boy’s sound in which the band implemented a diverse array of musical styles including funk, R, and flamenco. As reported by Billboard, Fall Out Boy [...] "drifts further from its hardcore punk roots to write increasingly accessible pop tunes," [...] a slight departure from the group's previous more pop punk sound predominant on their 2003 effort, <b>Take</b> <b>This</b> <b>to</b> Your Grave.|$|E

500|$|The group {{purposely}} {{cut short}} {{the amount of}} time set aside for recording the album, and did not notify its label before beginning work on the record. The members hoped that these steps would bring them back to the days when they were a young, broke band who had to finish an album before the money ran out. [...] "There was something really interesting about that creative process when we were starting out," [...] explained Stump. [...] "The more time you have, the more potential you have for excess." [...] He felt that the process was reminiscent of the making of <b>Take</b> <b>This</b> <b>to</b> Your Grave because both albums were created using a [...] "first-thought, best-thought" [...] mentality: [...] "I think we were trying to find what making a record that way would sound like now, but with four adult Fall Out Boys." [...] Trohman called the recording process [...] "fun because [...] was so collaborative," [...] but difficult because it was rushed.|$|E
500|$|Fall Out Boy's albums <b>Take</b> <b>This</b> <b>to</b> Your Grave and From Under the Cork Tree {{are both}} {{said to have}} pop punk as well as punk rock sounds and influences, and Infinity on High {{features}} {{a wide range of}} styles and instrumentation, including orchestral arrangements ("Thnks fr th Mmrs") and a slower piano ballad ("Golden"). R influences on Infinity on High are on songs such as [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" [...] and two of the album's tracks are produced by R singer/producer Babyface. On Folie à Deux, the group continues to evolve its sound, with less of a pop punk sound and increasing the use of piano (such as [...] "What a Catch, Donnie", [...] "Headfirst Slide into Cooperstown on a Bad Bet", and [...] "20 Dollar Nose Bleed"), synthesizers, and guest artists. The band also shows a number of influences, with [...] "Disloyal Order of Water Buffaloes" [...] borrowing a chord sequence from The Who song [...] "Baba O'Riley". [...] The group has worked with many producers and artists, including The Neptunes, Timbaland, Ryan Adams, Lil Wayne and Kanye West, the latter of which Patrick Stump described as [...] "the Prince of his generation." ...|$|E
500|$|Stump called [...] "This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race" [...] the [...] "funkiest thing we’ve ever done", and {{attributes}} {{the change in}} musical style to his love of soul music, which he acquired by listening to oldies stations as a child. Wentz describes the song [...] "a bit of '70s funk mixed with [...] <b>Take</b> <b>This</b> <b>to</b> Your Grave with tight verses and big, fat choruses". The song closing sing-along was influenced by Justin Timberlake's [...] "Señorita". Cory Apar of Allmusic compared the Babyface-produced track [...] "I'm Like a Lawyer with the Way I'm Always Trying to Get You Off (Me & You)" [...] to Maroon 5. Wentz characterized Stump’s vocal performance on the song as [...] "straight-up Motown", continuing to say [...] "If there wasn't a rock band playing, it'd be straight R, and he'd go on tour with just an upright bass and a drum and open up for R. Kelly." [...] "The Carpal Tunnel of Love" [...] {{has been referred to}} as [...] "a prime slab of what the boys have become famous for: highly caffeinated pop-punk mixed with a little white-boy soul and some hard-core yelping." [...] The song features Stump singing in a falsetto in the chorus over Trohman’s [...] "crunchy" [...] guitars, as well as a breakdown in which Wentz employs death growl-style vocals.|$|E

500|$|The band's debut album, <b>Take</b> <b>This</b> <b>to</b> Your Grave, {{was issued}} by Fueled by Ramen in May 2003. Previously, {{one of the}} band's {{earliest}} recordings, Evening Out with Your Girlfriend, had not seen release until shortly before Grave in March 2003, when the band had gained considerable momentum. [...] "Our record was something being rushed out to help generate some interest, but that interest was building before we could even get the record out," [...] said Sean Muttaqi. The band actively tried to stop Uprising from releasing the recordings (as the band's relationship with Muttaqi had grown sour), as the band viewed it as a [...] "giant piece of garbage" [...] recorded before Hurley's involvement that the band members ceased to consider the debut album of the group. Gradually, the band's fanbase grew in size as the label pushed for the album's mainstream success. According to Wentz, shows began to end in a near-riot and the group were banned from several venues because the entire crowd would end up onstage. The band gained positive reviews for subsequent gigs at South by Southwest (SXSW) and various tour appearances. The band joined the Warped Tour for five dates {{in the summer of}} 2004, and on one date the band had only performed three songs when the stage collapsed due to the large crowd. The band appeared {{on the cover of the}} August 2004 edition of Alternative Press, and listening stations at Hot Topic partially helped the album move 2,000-3,000 copies per week by Christmas 2004, at which point the label considered the band [...] "tipping" [...] into mainstream success.|$|E
500|$|The {{band had}} been flooded with [...] "hyperbolic praise," [...] and deemed [...] "the next big thing" [...] by {{multiple}} media outlets. Before recording the follow-up to its debut, the band released the acoustic EP/DVD My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue. The EP was the band's first charting on the Billboard 200 at number 153. From Under the Cork Tree {{was recorded in}} Burbank, California, and served as {{the first time the}} band had stayed in California {{for an extended period of}} time. The group lived in corporate housing during the making of the album. In contrast to <b>Take</b> <b>This</b> <b>to</b> Your Graves rushed recording schedule, Fall Out Boy took a much more gradual pace while working on From Under the Cork Tree. It was the first Fall Out Boy record in which Stump created all the music and Wentz wrote all the lyrics, continuing the approach they took for some songs on Grave. Stump felt that this process was much more [...] "smooth" [...] as every member was able to focus on his individual strengths. He explained: [...] "We haven't had any of those moments when I play the music and he'll say, 'I don't like that,' and he'll read me lyrics and I'll say, 'I don't like those lyrics.' It's very natural and fun." [...] Despite this, the band had great difficulty creating its desired sound for the album, constantly scrapping new material. Two weeks before recording sessions began, the group abandoned ten songs and wrote eight more, including the album's first single, [...] "Sugar, We're Goin Down." ...|$|E
