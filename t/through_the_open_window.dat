5|$|The heat is made {{tangible}} by the flustered {{appearance of}} the woman as she fans herself (the fan itself displays a classical scene—perhaps Venus, Adonis and Cupid); the sluggish pregnant dog that looks longingly towards the water; and the vigorous vine growing {{on the side of}} the tavern. As is often the case in Hogarth's work, the dog's expression reflects that of its master. The family rush home, past the New River and a tavern with a sign showing Sir Hugh Myddleton, who bankrupted himself financing the construction of the river to bring running water into London in 1613 (a wooden pipe lies by the side of the watercourse). <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window</b> other refugees from the city can be seen sheltering from the oppressive heat in the bar. While they appear more jolly than the dyer and his family, Hogarth pokes fun at these people escaping to the country for fresh air only to reproduce the smoky air and crowded conditions of the city by huddling in the busy tavern with their pipes.|$|E
25|$|One Sunday, {{the balloon}} is told to stay home, while Pascal and his {{grandmother}} go to church. However, the balloon follows them, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window,</b> into the church; Pascal and his grandmother are led {{out by a}} scolding beadle.|$|E
25|$|In his miserable room, Dionis is {{studying}} an almanac of astrology, and listening, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window,</b> {{to a girl}} singing; charmed by the sound, he sees (or imagines) the girl as a modern-day Ophelia. In this reverie, his eyes affixed on the zodiac, Dionis understands that he can freely travel back into the glorified past. He chooses for his destination ancient Moldavia, {{under the rule of}} Prince Alexander the Good. When he awakens, he finds himself on a meadow near Iași, dressed in Orthodox monastic clothes, and grasping the almanac. He is Friar Dan, who he has only dreamed of being Dionis, and the book is a present from his teacher, Ruben.|$|E

60|$|They {{were talking}} in the flat at Clement's Inn. The night was hot. <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>windows</b> <b>the</b> roar of the Strand sounded faintly. Mike {{walked to the window}} and looked out.|$|R
25|$|The {{situation}} deteriorated {{at about}} 3 AM, when 29-year-old African American Benoris Toney {{was shot in}} the head in the parking lot of the Dougherty Lumber Co. at 12100 Euclid Avenue. Toney had been traveling on Euclid when, according to police eyewitnesses, another vehicle began to parallel him. Toney pulled into the parking lot, where police had been stationed all night long, and the other vehicle followed him. The men in the second vehicle then shot Toney twice with a shotgun <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window</b> of Toney's automobile. The assailants' vehicle then sped away. The police gave chase and stopped it, arresting six white adults and teenagers. Another 100 Cleveland police and Guardsmen, as well as a Cleveland police helicopter, rushed to the scene. Police later released four of the suspects, but sought a third man who allegedly fled the vehicle. Toney died on the afternoon of July 23.|$|E
500|$|Carla {{becomes the}} victim of racism in the third chapter, [...] "Trespass", with school boys telling her to [...] "Go back to where you came from, you dirty spic!" [...] Later she is {{subjected}} to a child molester who masturbates in his car while pulling up at the curb and talking lecherously to her <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window.</b> The {{second part of the}} novel finishes with the chapter [...] "Floor Show", in which the García family goes to a Spanish restaurant and Sandra witnesses the host's wife amorously attempting to kiss her father {{on the way to the}} bathroom. Overall, Part II presents the unexpected aspects of living in the United States and becoming Americans, and explores the tensions that develop with the immigrant experience.|$|E
500|$|The stream's course leads Olivero to a mill, where {{through a}} lighted window {{he sees a}} woman tied to a chair, forced by the miller to drink the blood of a freshly {{slaughtered}} lamb. Instinctively, Olivero hurls himself <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window,</b> his [...] "leap {{into the world of}} fantasy". The miller initially offers no resistance and allows Olivero to release the woman, whom he recognises by the colour of her skin to be Sally, one of the two green children who had mysteriously arrived in the village on the day he left, thirty years earlier; Olivero also recognises the miller as Kneeshaw, an ex-pupil at the village school where he had once taught. During a struggle between the two men Kneeshaw is accidentally drowned in the mill pond. The next morning Olivero and Sally continue on Olivero's quest to find the stream's destination, a pool in the moors high above the village. Paddling in its water, Sally begins to sink into the silvery sand covering its bed. Olivero rushes to her, and hand in hand they sink beneath the water of the pool.|$|E
60|$|He {{deflected}} {{his course}} {{from the library}} and strolled out <b>through</b> <b>the</b> flowers near <b>the</b> tower room. <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>windows</b> of it came Paula's happy humming. Dick pressed his lower lip with tight quickness between his teeth and strolled on.|$|R
60|$|His little {{carriage}} moved {{towards the}} door. The {{brother and sister}} passed out. Esther led Gerald into the great dining-room, and from there, <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>windows,</b> out on to the terrace. She gripped his shoulder and pointed down to the Tower.|$|R
60|$|He bowed low, and {{remained}} {{for a moment}} alone in <b>the</b> Palm House. <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>windows</b> came <b>the</b> sound of ascending rockets hissing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> still night air--the grounds were ablaze with lights. He passed out, and mingled with the crowd of people.|$|R
500|$|The primary {{composition}} of the painting is in {{the contrast between the}} solemn jester (Stańczyk)– obviously the focus of the painting– and the lively ball going on in the background. Stańczyk is shown sitting alone in a dark room, while a ball, hosted by the royal family, is in full swing in the neighbouring hall. His appearance is unlike that one would expect in a jester– gloomy, deep in thought. His seriousness is reinforced by his accessories: his marotte lies discarded on the floor, whereas a holy medallion of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa can be seen on his torso. The wrinkled carpet at Stanczyk's feet could have been formed by his collapsing heavily into the chair upon reading the letter, or through a nervous shifting of the feet thereafter. On the table lies a letter likely announcing that Poland has lost Smolensk (now in Russia) to the Grand Duchy of Muscovy, causing Stańczyk's sorrow and reflection on his fatherland's fate. The letter seems to have been discarded by some official, and only the jester realizes its significance– while the rulers are partying, celebrating the recent victory at the battle of Orsha, disregarding the bad news about Smolensk. [...] It {{is interesting to note that}} the letter bears the year 1533 (A.d. MDXXXIII) and the name [...] "Samogitia", a province of the Commonwealth. [...] The note is incongruent with the actual date of the fall of Smolensk in 1514, and is a matter of ongoing debate, with an outright mistake by the meticulous Matejko, known for use of symbolism and iconography, being unlikely. [...] Another symbol, a lute, symbol of glory, is being carried by a midget, stereotyped as a person of low stature and morale in Matejko's time; this suggests a decline of the Jagiellon dynasty's fortunes. The window is thrown - or was blown - open, ruffling the tablecloth and alluding to an upset of the present order. [...] <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window,</b> the darkened profile of Wawel Cathedral in Krakow is visible - the site of the coronation of Polish kings. [...] Next to it, a comet is seen– a portent of ill fortune. [...] The imagery of downfall is completed with the inclusion of the three stars of Orion's Belt seen above and to the left of the cathedral spire. [...] In Greek mythology, Orion was a powerful hunter blinded by ego and his own greatness, but was ultimately brought down by the pinprick of a scorpion's sting.|$|E
2500|$|In the Katamon quarter, we {{were held}} up by a Jewish Army type jeep placed in a road block and filled with men in Jewish Army uniforms. At the same moment, I saw an armed man coming from this jeep. I took little notice of this because I merely thought it was another checkpoint. However, he put a Tommy gun <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window</b> on {{my side of the}} car, and fired point blank at Count Bernadotte and Colonel Serot. I also heard shots fired from other points, and there was {{considerable}} confusion... Colonel Serot fell in the seat in back of me, and I saw at once that he was dead. Count Bernadotte bent forward, and I thought {{at the time he was}} trying to get cover. I asked him: 'Are you wounded?' He nodded, and fell back.... When we arrived ... I carried the Count inside and laid him on the bed.... I took off the Count's jacket and tore away his shirt and undervest. I saw that he was wounded around the heart and that there was also a considerable quantity of blood on his clothes about it. When the doctor arrived, I asked if anything could be done, but he replied that it was too late.|$|E

60|$|CURTIS and BIGELOW are discovered. CURTIS is half-sitting on {{the corner}} of the table, left, smoking a pipe.

MARTHA's voice joins in with theirs.|$|R
60|$|They all {{entered the}} room, which {{was large and}} handsomely furnished. <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>windows</b> came a gentle current of fresh air. Mr. Dunster lay {{in the midst of}} all the luxury of fine linen sheets and {{embroidered}} pillow-cases. The inspector looked at him stolidly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wake up, Patsy: I smell coffee!" [...] called Beth, {{and soon}} the two girls were dressed and {{assisting}} Myrtle to complete her toilet. <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>windows</b> came <b>the</b> cool, fragrant breath of morning; the sky was beginning to blush at {{the coming of the}} sun.|$|R

60|$|The {{next morning}} the two boys {{presented}} themselves at Mr. Penrose's works at Limehouse. These were sawing and planing works, {{and the sound of}} many wheels, and the hoarse rasping sound of saws innumerable, came out <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>windows</b> of <b>the</b> building as they entered the yard.|$|R
60|$|Turning off, {{he went to}} the huts, {{which lay}} two or three hundred yards away from the house. As he did so he passed near the houses in which the mulatto overseers lived. There were lights here, and he could hear the sound of voices <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
60|$|The immense train clattered and jolted to a stop. A roar of wind, a {{cloud of}} powdery dust, a {{discordant}} and unceasing din of voices, came <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>windows</b> of <b>the</b> car. The heterogeneous mass of humanity with which Neale had traveled jostled out, struggling with packs and bags.|$|R
60|$|He {{could not}} control himself, rose up, made a long stride, and passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>window</b> into the garden.|$|E

60|$|Here <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>windows</b> I saw <b>the</b> green folk {{squatting}} {{upon their}} sleeping silks and furs, grunting an occasional monosyllable, which, {{in connection with}} their wondrous telepathic powers, is ample for their conversational requirements. As I drew closer {{to listen to their}} words a warrior entered the room from the hall beyond.|$|R
6000|$|Seated {{near the}} prettiest girls, who offered us their hymn books--in the cleanly odor of fresh pine shavings, and ironed muslin, and blown {{over by the}} spices of our own woods <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>windows,</b> {{a deep sense of}} the abiding peace of Christian communion settled upon us. At this supreme moment someone murmured in an awe-stricken whisper: ...|$|R

50|$|The pumping {{stations}} (as well as {{the palace}} and its garden) are administered and operated by the Bavarian Department of State-owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes.

60|$|The {{drumming}} of hoofs rang {{more sharply}} <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> <b>windows,</b> for <b>the</b> sod {{was hard and}} dry. It stopped suddenly and Agatha saw Wyllard start as a man came into the room. He was a little, thick-set man with a seamed and tanned face. He was dressed in rather old blue serge, and he walked {{as if he were}} a seaman.|$|R
60|$|It is a sultry {{evening at}} dusk. The stones of Wellington Street are hot and gritty, and the watermen and hackney-coachmen at the Theatre opposite, are much flushed and aggravated.
