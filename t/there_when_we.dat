25|$|Charles Thomas Payne is Madelyn Dunham's {{younger brother}} and Obama's great-uncle. He {{was born in}} 1925. Payne served during World War II in the U.S. Army 89th Infantry Division. Obama has often {{described}} Payne's role in liberating the Ohrdruf forced labor camp. There was brief media attention when Obama mistakenly identified the camp as Auschwitz during the campaign. In 2009, Payne spoke about his war experience: Ohrdruf was in that string of towns going across, south of Gotha and Erfurt. Our division {{was the first one}} in <b>there.</b> <b>When</b> <b>we</b> arrived there were no German soldiers anywhere around that I knew about. There was no fighting against the Germans, no camp guards. The whole area was overrun by people from the camp dressed in the most pitiful rags, and most of them were in a bad state of starvation.|$|E
500|$|Graham {{felt his}} team [...] "...were <b>there</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were leading 2–1," [...] and {{expressed}} his sympathy for Winterburn, [...] "He {{is a good}} signing for Arsenal and to miss a penalty {{so close to the}} end was a great disappointment to him." [...] He extended his congratulations to Luton, in particular Dibble, telling reporters: [...] "Their goalkeeper was absolutely superb. He kept them in the game when they could have been finished." [...] The Arsenal manager also revealed the club would take action against Williams for disappearing on the matchday. The defeat prompted Graham to strengthen his defence over the summer; he was unable to convince his first choice Gary Pallister to join the club, but managed to sign 25-year-old defender Steve Bould from Stoke. Bould went on to displace Caesar in the starting eleven, whose career stalled after the 1988 final.|$|E
500|$|In January 1959, Kelly {{joined the}} {{musician}} {{with whom he}} became most associated – Miles Davis. Adderley, the alto saxophonist in the band, related how Kelly came to replace Red Garland on piano: Davis had admired Kelly's playing as part of Gillespie's band, and Garland was invariably late to arrive for their club performances; [...] "One night, Wynton was <b>there</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> started and Miles asked him to sit in. When Red came, Wynton was playing. Miles told Red, 'Wynton's got the gig.' Just like that." [...] Kelly stayed with the trumpeter until March 1963, appearing on the studio albums Kind of Blue and Someday My Prince Will Come, {{as well as on}} numerous concert recordings. On 1959's Kind of Blue, often mentioned as the best-selling jazz album ever, Kelly replaced Bill Evans on the track [...] "Freddie Freeloader". Even though Kelly was Davis' regular pianist, the trumpeter had planned his album with Evans in mind, so this was the only piece that Kelly played. Kelly toured 22 cities in Europe as part of Davis' quintet in the spring of 1960. Fellow pianist McCoy Tyner commented on Kelly's playing with Davis: [...] "His harmonic colorations were very beautiful. But I think above all it was his ability to swing. John [...] used to mention that. Miles used to get off the bandstand and just look at Wynton with admiration, because he really held the group together." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ashfield {{spoke to}} James VI twice, in Edinburgh {{and during the}} King's hunting at Colinton. An agent of the Earl of Essex, Thomas Weyman, later wrote that Ashfield had {{discussed}} the possibility of James becoming King of England over dinner with some noblemen. The Earl of Cassilis joked; [...] "Truly the Englishmen are good husbandmen, and have so well manured the grounds their grounds that we shall find a goodly and pleasant dwelling <b>there</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> come." [...] Weyman thought that Ashfield's activities would turn James against the Earl of Essex.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2012 {{profile of}} Silvers, The New York Times noted: [...] "His {{greatest}} pleasure ... is simply good writing, which {{he talks about}} as others talk about fine wine or good food. Speaking about writers he likes, he sometimes flushes with enthusiasm. 'I admire great writers, people with marvelous and beautiful minds, and always hope they will do something special and revealing for us.'" [...] Philip Marino, in The University of Chicago Magazine, commented: [...] "Like a chemist pairing ingredients to induce a specific reaction, Silvers has built his career matching the right author and subject, in hopes of generating an exciting and illuminating result. ... 'he puts a writer together with material that even the writer might not have thought was appropriate,' says Daniel Mendelsohn". Glen Weldon, writing for NPR, concurred: [...] "He encouraged writers to craft each review as a vigorous intellectual argument, and delighted in pairing reviewers with books that challenged their personal or political worldview." [...] Professor Peter Brown wrote: [...] "Reviewing for Bob Silvers was like playing in the sprinkling rain of a mighty fountain ... to be doused in the sheer, bubbling delight of Bob’s own unquenchable enthusiasm and alert, discerning curiosity. It widened the heart". In The Nation, Harvard professor Stanley Hoffmann observed that, in publishing {{some of the earliest}} criticisms of the Vietnam and Iraq wars, Silvers realized what other commentators missed: [...] "In both instances, Bob Silvers was, in effect, whether deliberately or not, compensating for the weaknesses of the more established media. ... It was important that a journal which has the authority of the Review in a sense took up the slack and presented viewpoints which were extremely hard to get into the established media." [...] The Nation added, during the Iraq war:One suspects [...] yearn for the day when they can return to their normal publishing routine – that gentlemanly pastiche of philosophy, art, classical music, photography, German and Russian history, East European politics, literary fiction – unencumbered by political duties of a confrontational or oppositional nature.

2500|$|The grave {{design process}} was placed under tight secrecy. An {{extensive}} research project {{was conducted in}} which hundreds of famous tombs (such as the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus and Grant's Tomb) {{as well as all}} existing presidential burial sites. Warnecke discussed design concepts with more than 40 architects, sculptors, painters, landscape architects, stonemasons, calligraphers, and liturgical experts—including the sculptor Isamu Noguchi, architectural model maker Theodore Conrad, and the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts. Noguchi counseled Warnecke to add a large sculptural cross to the site and to eliminate the eternal flame (which he felt was kitschy). Warnecke consulted with Mrs. Kennedy about the design of the grave many times over the following year. Hundreds of architectural drawings and models were produced to explore design ideas. On April 6, 1964, Warnecke sent a memorandum to Mrs. Kennedy in which he outlined his desire to retain the eternal flame as the centerpiece of the burial site and to keep the site's design as simple as possible. In the course of the research and conceptualization effort, Warnecke considered the appropriateness of structures or memorials at the site (such as crosses, shafts, pavilions, etc.), the history of Arlington National Cemetery, the vista, and how to handle ceremonies at the site. By August 1964, Warnecke and his assistants had written a 76-page research report which concluded that the gravesite was not a memorial nor monument, but a grave. [...] "This particular hillside, this flame, this man and this point in history must be synthesized in one statement that has distinctive character of its own. We must avoid adding elements that in later decades might become superficial and detract from the deeds of the man," [...] Warnecke wrote For some time {{in the spring and summer}} of 1964, the design process appeared to slow as Warnecke and his associates struggled to design the actual graves. But in the summer of 1964 Sargent Shriver, President Kennedy's brother-in-law, forcefully told Warnecke that [...] "There must be something <b>there</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> get there." [...] This spurred the design effort forward. In the late summer and early fall, Warnecke considered massive headstones, a sarcophagus, a sunken tomb, a raised tomb, and sculpture to mark the graves. Very late in the design process, two abstract sculptures were designed but ultimately rejected.|$|E

The walkways and elliptical overlook were conceptualized very early in the design process.
