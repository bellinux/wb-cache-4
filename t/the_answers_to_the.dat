5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move in the same direction are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mind–body problem already described.|$|E

5000|$|The current {{syndicated}} version {{found in}} most daily newspapers (under the official title Jumble, That Scrambled Word Game) has four base anagrams, two of five letters and two of six, followed by a clue {{and a series of}} blank spaces in which <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clue fits. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clue is generally a pun of some sort.

In order <b>to</b> find <b>the</b> letters that are in <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> given clue, the player must unscramble all four of the scrambled words; the letters that are in the clue will be circled.

25|$|In {{contrast}} to the original Metal Gear Solid, Sons of Liberty was released in North America first, on November 12, 2001. Because of the later release in the region, the protagonist switch was not kept a secret in the Japanese version in the weeks prior to its release. A preview event was held in Zepp Tokyo {{on the day of}} the game's North American release in which the character of Raiden was unveiled to the Japanese public. As a result, the Japanese packaging artwork depicts Raiden standing prominently next to Solid Snake, as opposed to only having Snake like on the cover artwork used for the American (and later European) version. A questionnaire was also added in the Japanese version, in which players are asked about their experience with the original Metal Gear Solid and action games in general; <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> questionnaire determines the difficulty level of the game and whether the player starts the game on the Tanker chapter or skips directly to the Plant chapter (an option that is only available after clearing the game once in the American version). The Japanese version has a few other additional features over the American version, including two extra game modes unlocked after completing the main game: Boss Survival, in which the player replays through the boss battles from the main game as either, Snake or Raiden; and Casting Theater, in which the player can view certain cutscenes from the main game and replace the character models.|$|E
25|$|Separators {{have been}} used as part of data {{compression}} algorithms for representing planar graphs and other separable graphs using a small number of bits. The basic principle of these algorithms is to choose a number k and repeatedly subdivide the given planar graph using separators into O(n/k) subgraphs of size at most k, with O(n/√k) vertices in the separators. With an appropriate choice of k (at most proportional to the logarithm of n) the number of non-isomorphic k-vertex planar subgraphs is significantly less than the number of subgraphs in the decomposition, so the graph can be compressed by constructing a table of all the possible non-isomorphic subgraphs and representing each subgraph in the separator decomposition by its index into the table. The remainder of the graph, formed by the separator vertices, may be represented explicitly or by using a recursive version of the same data structure. Using this method, planar graphs and many more restricted families of planar graphs may be encoded using a number of bits that is information-theoretically optimal: if there are Pn n-vertex graphs in the family of graphs to be represented, then an individual graph in the family can be represented using only (1nbsp&+nbsp&o(n))log2Pn bits. It is also possible to construct representations of this type in which one may test adjacency between vertices, determine the degree of a vertex, and list neighbors of vertices in constant time per query, by augmenting the table of subgraphs with additional tabular information representing <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> queries.|$|E

500|$|The creators' and producers' {{goals were}} to [...] "empower, challenge, {{and build the}} {{self-esteem}} of preschoolers" [...] while entertaining them. Kessler, Santomero and Johnson were influenced by Sesame Street, the first children's television program to utilize a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum developed from research. [...] "We wanted to learn from Sesame Street and take it one step further," [...] Santomero said. [...] Like Sesame Street, formative research which the producers called their [...] "secret sauce," [...] was used during {{all aspects of the}} creative and decision-making process during the production of Blue's Clues. In addition to a curriculum that emphasized reasoning skills relevant to preschoolers' everyday lives, the producers wanted to include audience participation, called by Variety its [...] "call and response style," [...] that encouraged mastery of the information presented, positive reinforcement, and prosocial messages. In their first brainstorming sessions in 1994, Santomero, Kessler, and Johnson decided to promote mastery rather than rote learning or memorizing, make sure that their viewers knew <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> puzzles with which they were presented, and include elements of surprise and play. By 2001, the show's research team consisted of head researcher Alice Wilder, Alison Sherman, Karen Leavitt, and Koshi Dhingra. The research team and creators worked collaboratively.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics.

[...] The main reason behind creating a resolution to the Syndicate arc was that Chris Carter thought the series was going to be cancelled by early 2000. While promoting the episode, Carter said it would give many long-waited answers {{but at the same time}} create new ones. Earl Cressey from DVD Talk named [...] "Two Fathers," [...] along with its follow-up [...] "One Son," [...] as one of the [...] "highlights of season six." [...] Joyce Millman from Salon magazine said the episode (along with [...] "One Son") was one [...] "of the most coherent, [...] almost unbearably tense, hours in the series' run". The Michigan Daily reviewer Melissa Runstrom said [...] "Two Fathers" [...] along with [...] "One Son" [...] and season finale [...] "Biogenesis" [...] were the highlights of the sixth season.|$|E
500|$|On {{a stormy}} Cambridge night, Nina lets herself in to an office, {{where she is}} found by Professor Nigel Squires. He is holding a gun, {{but it is not}} loaded. Nina's boyfriend Simon is a fan of cryptic crosswords, but she is never able to help him. She has come to the office of Squires—a classicist who sets crosswords for Varsity as the Sphinx—to seek <b>the</b> <b>answers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next day's crossword. Squires sets about to teach Nina: [...] "I teach wild {{creature}} without hospital building" [...] results in ARCHITECTURE, which Simon studies. They turn to the clues for the next day, beginning to fill a large grid. Squires uses the name of the Sphinx because she would asphyxiate and consume those who failed to answer her riddle: she was [...] "devious and deadly". Squires makes tea, as Nina looks to his trophies. A picture of Squires with his late wife draws her attention, and they discuss the cut-throat world of competitive crosswording. Nina has answered DOWNANDOUT and WRAP; Squires answers DESI and helps with TRENT. Squires asks about Simon, but catches Nina in a lie; with her excuse being that she only wants to learn. Together, they deduce SWAMPLANDS, meaning [...] "bog". Nina, though, suggests that is should be bogs, otherwise Squires would be cheating. Suddenly spluttering, Squires takes a seat, as Nina begins on the next clue. She suddenly displays clear proficiency, answering ASPHYXIATION.|$|E
