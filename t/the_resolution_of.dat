As a mathematician, Putnam contributed to <b>the</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> Hilbert's tenth problem in mathematics.

5|$|A same-document {{reference}} is a URI {{reference to a}} document containing the URI reference itself. A URI {{reference is}} defined as a same-document reference if, when resolved to absolute form, it equates exactly to the base URI in effect for the reference. When encountering a same-document reference, document processing software, for example a web browser, to efficiently use its current representation of a document to satisfy <b>the</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> a reference to that document without fetching a new representation. URI equivalence is defined as when a URI reference, while not identical to the base URI, still represents the same resource.|$|E
5|$|Ab initio phasing {{or direct}} methods – This {{is usually the}} method of choice for small {{molecules}} (<1000 non-hydrogen atoms), and has been used successfully to solve the phase problems for small proteins. If <b>the</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> the data is better than 1.4 Å (140 pm), direct methods {{can be used to}} obtain phase information, by exploiting known phase relationships between certain groups of reflections.|$|E
5000|$|The {{feature of}} Generalized {{spectrogram}} {{is that the}} window sizes of [...] and [...] are different. Since <b>the</b> time-frequency <b>resolution</b> {{will be affected by}} the window size, if one choose a wide [...] and a narrow [...] (or <b>the</b> opposite), <b>the</b> <b>resolutions</b> <b>of</b> them will be high in different part of spectrogram. After the multiplication of these two Gabor transform, <b>the</b> <b>resolutions</b> <b>of</b> both time and frequency axis will be enhanced.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> {{detection}} <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> one pixel {{depend on}} the algorithm based on the MATLAB software. As calculated above, the method has a displacement sensitivity of 5.4  pixels/μm, which means <b>the</b> <b>resolution</b> was 0.18  μm. For the displacement sensitivity of 2.3  pixels/°, it was a <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> 0.0075  rad. This shows that, based on the method presented here and <b>the</b> CCD <b>resolution,</b> <b>the</b> <b>resolutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> displacement and angle were 0.18  μm and 0.0075  rad, respectively. The 480  ×  640  pixel CCD was used to acquire {{the image of the}} two-dimensional spot array in real time. Additionally, higher pixels CCD and optimization of the light path could improve <b>the</b> <b>resolutions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> displacement and the deflection angle up to sub-nanometer and micro-radian scales, respectively.|$|R

5|$|Beginning in February, {{with the}} help of the French {{ambassador}} Léon Roches, a plan was formulated to stop the imperial court's advance at Odawara, the last strategic entry point to Edo, but Yoshinobu decided against the plan. Shocked, Léon Roches resigned from his position. In early March, under the influence of the British minister Harry Parkes, foreign nations signed a strict neutrality agreement, according to which they could not intervene or provide military supplies to either side until <b>the</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Electron {{holography}} is an {{imaging technique}} that photographically records the electron interference pattern of an object, {{which is then}} reconstructed to yield a greatly magnified image of the original object. This technique was developed to enable greater resolution in electron microscopy than is possible using conventional imaging techniques. <b>The</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> conventional electron microscopy is not limited by electron wavelength, but by the large aberrations of electron lenses.|$|E

In August, Harding argued for giving Wilson almost dictatorial powers, stating that democracy had little place in time of war. Harding voted for most war legislation, including the Espionage Act of 1917, which restricted civil liberties, though he opposed the excess profits tax as anti-business. In May 1918, Harding, less enthusiastic about Wilson, opposed a bill to expand the president's powers.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} that many transient phenomena might not {{be associated with the}} Moon itself but could be a result of unfavourable observing conditions or phenomena associated with the Earth. For instance, some reported transient phenomena are for objects near <b>the</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> the employed telescopes. The Earth's atmosphere can give rise to significant temporal distortions that could be confused with actual lunar phenomena (an effect known as astronomical seeing). Other non-lunar explanations include the viewing of Earth-orbiting satellites and meteors or observational error.|$|E
5|$|Noether {{was brought}} to Göttingen in 1915 by David Hilbert and Felix Klein, who wanted her {{expertise}} in invariant theory to help them in understanding general relativity, a geometrical theory of gravitation developed mainly by Albert Einstein. Hilbert had observed that the conservation of energy seemed to be violated in general relativity, because gravitational energy could itself gravitate. Noether provided <b>the</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> this paradox, and a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics, with Noether's first theorem, which she proved in 1915, but did not publish until 1918. She not only solved the problem for general relativity, but also determined the conserved quantities for every system of physical laws that possesses some continuous symmetry.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{present at}} King William's {{death in a}} hunting accident, Warelwast served as a diplomat to the king's successor, Henry I. After <b>the</b> <b>resolution</b> <b>of</b> the Investiture Controversy, Warelwast was rewarded with the bishopric of Exeter in Devon, but he {{continued}} to serve Henry as a diplomat and royal judge. He began {{the construction of a}} new cathedral at Exeter, and he probably divided the diocese into archdeaconries. Warelwast went blind after 1120, and after his death in 1137 was succeeded by his nephew, Robert Warelwast.|$|E
