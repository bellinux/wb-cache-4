40|$|Gamma-ray geotomography {{was used}} to measure the dry bulk density and {{porosity}} distributions in two cores of slightly-welded tuff. The cores were then subjected to a point or non-point source of water, and water movement through the cores was observed using tomography. Three numerical methods, the Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART), modified ART, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) were used to reconstruct the <b>tomographs,</b> and SVD was found to be superior for the simple <b>tomographs</b> of this study. Several tomographic models were used to determine the maximum image resolution from a given set of data. The effects of increasing the number of gamma-ray measurements on resolution were also studied. Finally, the <b>tomographs</b> were compared with laboratory measurements for validation. The tomographically predicted dry bulk density distributions were similar to the measured dry bulk density distributions within each core. However, the percent saturation <b>tomographs</b> were found to be inaccurate when water was rapidly moving through the cores because of the considerable time required to obtain the numerous gamma-ray attenuation measurements...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} Tunnel Complex G at the Nevada Test Site to evaluate geotomography as a possible candidate for in situ monitoring of hydrology in the near field of a heater placed in densely welded tuff. Alterant <b>tomographs</b> of 200 MHz electromagnetic permittivity were made for a vertical and a horizontal plane. After the 1 kilowatt heater was turned on, the <b>tomographs</b> indicated a rapid and strong drying adjacent to the heater. Moisture loss was not symmetric about the heater, but seemed to be strongly influenced by heterogeneity in the rock mass. The linear character of many tomographic features and their spatial correlation with fractures mapped in boreholes are evidence that drying was most rapid along some fractures. When the heater was turned off, an increase in moisture content occurred around the heater and along the dry fractures. However, this process is much slower and {{the magnitude of the}} moisture increase much smaller than the changes observed during heating of the rock. The interpretation of the <b>tomographs</b> is preliminary until they can be processed without the restrictive assumption of straight ray paths for the signals through the highly heterogeneous rock mass. 15 refs., 4 figs...|$|R

40|$|When {{planning}} to place implants in the posterior {{region of the}} maxilla, {{the location of the}} maxillary sinus floor is influencing the available bone height and the implant length chosen. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate in vitro the spiral tomographic technique that could be used for pre-operative implant planning. <b>Tomographs</b> were taken of 6 dry human skulls using the Cranex Tome multifunctional unit (Orion Corporation Soredex, Helsinki, Finland). Three sites were selected in the left posterior maxilla and marked with gutta percha meaning a total of 18 sites (6 x 3 = 18) for interpretation. Bone height and width were measured on the <b>tomographs</b> and after sectioning also on the skulls. The values obtained from the measurements on <b>tomographs</b> were divided by an enlargement factor of 1. 5 (as defined by the manufacturer) and then compared with those from the real measurements on the skulls. Real measurements were on average 0. 24 mm (SD 0. 19) lower than the tomographic measurements (P < 0. 05). From the present results it could be concluded that spiral tomography using the recently developed Cranex Tome reveals sufficient information and detail for pre-operative planning of a limited edentulous region. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Alterant {{tomography}} {{has been}} evaluated {{for its ability}} to delineate in-situ water flow paths in a fractured welded-tuff rock mass. The evaluation involved a field experiment in which <b>tomographs</b> of electromagnetic attenuation factor (or attenuation rate) at 300 MHz were made before, during, and after the introduction to the rock of two different water-based tracers: a plain water and dye solution, and salt water and dye. Alterant <b>tomographs</b> were constructed by subtracting, cell by cell, the attenuation factors derived from measurements before each tracer was added to the rock mass from the attenuation factors derived after each tracer was added. The alterant <b>tomographs</b> were compared with other evidence of water movement in the rock: borescope logs of fractures, and post experiment cores used to locate the dye tracer on the fractured surfaces. These comparisons indicate that alterant tomography is suitable for mapping water flow through fractures and that it may be useful in inferring which of the fractures are hydrologically connected in the image plane. The technique appears to be sensitive enough to delineate flow through a single fracture and to define fractures with a spatial resolution of about 10 cm on an imaging scale of a few meters. 9 refs., 3 figs...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{impedance}} <b>tomographs</b> (magnitude and phase) of known, laboratory-scale {{targets are}} reported. Three methods {{are used to}} invert electrical impedance data and their <b>tomographs</b> compared. The first method uses an electrical resistance tomography (ERT) algonthm (designed for DC resistivity inversion) to perform impedance magnitude inversion and a linearized perturbation approach (PA) to invert the imaginary part. The second approximate method compares ERT magnitude inversions at two frequencies and uses the frequency effect (FE) to compute phase <b>tomographs.</b> The third approach, electrrcal impedance tomography (EIT), employs fully complex algebra {{to account for the}} real and imaginary components of electrical impedance data. The EIT approach provided useful magnitude and phase images for the frequency range of 0. 0625 to 64 Hz; images for higher frequencies were not reliable. Comparisons of the � ERT and EIT magnitude images show that both methods provided equivalent results for the water blank, copper rod and PVC rod targets. The EIT magnitude images showed better spatial resolutron for a sand-lead mixture target. Phase images located anomalies of both high and low contrast IP and provided better spatial resolution than the magnitude images. When IP was absent from the data, the EIT algorithm reconstructed phase values consistent with the data noise levels...|$|R
