5|$|A common neo-creationist {{objection}} to evolution is that evolution does not adhere to normal scientific standards—that {{it is not}} genuinely scientific. It is argued that evolutionary biology does not follow the scientific method and therefore should not be taught in science classes, or at least should be taught alongside other views (i.e., creationism). These objections often deal with <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> of evolutionary theory, the scientific method, and philosophy of science.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang {{music was}} also crucial in {{relation}} to courtships due to <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> of Islamic custom, which did not allow for unmarried {{men and women to}} intermingle. Traditionally, unmarried daughters were kept in a special chamber in the attic called a lamin, off-limit to visitors and suitors. It was only when she was allowed to play during kulintang performances that suitors were allowed to view her. Because of this, kulintang music was rare socially approved vehicles for interaction among the sexes.|$|E
5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} {{is a relatively}} young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, neurophilosophy has just recently become its own field with the works of Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland. Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> of mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between dualism and monism. Another related field is philosophy of language.|$|E

5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a {{wind turbine}} are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades {{is not the}} same as the airflow far away from the turbine. <b>The</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E
5|$|When {{appealing}} {{for military}} {{aid from the}} American Government {{in the aftermath of}} the Whitman massacre, the settlers detailed the structural weaknesses of the Provisional Government: <b>The</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> of our compact formed between the citizens of a republic and the subjects and official representatives of a monarchy, is such that the ties of political union could not be drawn so closely as to produce that stability and strength sufficient to form an efficient government. This union between democrats of a republic and wealthy aristocratic subjects of a monarchy could not be formed without reserving to themselves the right of allegiance to their respective governments. Political jealousy and strong party feeling have tended to thwart and render impotent the acts of a government, from its very nature weak and insufficient.|$|E

60|$|But {{the towns}} of which I am speaking--and {{of which there are}} but few now left in England, and these, with hardly an exception, cathedral towns--seem to suffer no such change. They neither {{progress}} nor fall back. If left behind, they are not beaten in the race, for they have never entered upon it; but are content to rest under the shelter of their tall spires and towers; to seek for no change and to meet with none; but to remain beloved, as no other towns are loved, by those who have long known them--assimilating, as it were, <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>natures</b> of those who dwell in them, to their own sober, neutral tints.|$|R
25|$|Also {{called the}} True Black Hand, the sect was secretive and {{claimed to have}} infiltrators in all other factions.

25|$|According {{to their}} {{external}} history, {{four types of}} creoles have been distinguished: plantation creoles, fort creoles, maroon creoles, and creolized pidgins. By <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> of a creole language, the phylogenetic classification of a particular creole usually {{is a matter of}} dispute; especially when the pidgin precursor and its parent tongues (which may have been other creoles or pidgins) have disappeared before they could be documented.|$|E
25|$|The Torah's {{story of}} {{creation}} {{is not intended}} as a scientific treatise, worthy of equal time with Darwin's theory of evolution in the curriculum of our public schools. The notes it strikes in its sparse and majestic narrative offer us an orientation to the Torah's entire religious worldview and value system. Creation is taken up first not because the subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> of things. And I would argue that their power is quite independent of the scientific {{context in which they}} were first enunciated.|$|E

Besides, the inability to penetrate the export market for bone trinkets and ornaments meant that there were limited outlets for these products due to <b>the</b> <b>very</b> thin <b>nature</b> of <b>the</b> local market.|$|R
25|$|In 1961 the British {{historian}} Edward Hallett Carr {{published his}} What is History?, which became well known. Therein Carr conjectured that <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> of writing history will cause historians {{as a whole}} to reveal themselves to their readers as 'prisoners' subject to {{the context of their}} own age and culture. As a consequence, one may add, every generation feels the need to rewrite history so that it better fits their own situation, their point of view. To illustrate his point here, Carr selected as exemplars a number of well-regarded historians, among them being Theodore Mommsen.|$|E
25|$|Kingship was a {{key element}} of Egyptian religion, through the king's role as link between {{humanity}} and the gods. Myths explain the background for this connection between royalty and divinity. The myths about the Ennead establish the king as heir to the lineage of rulers reaching back to the creator; the myth of divine birth states that the king is the son and heir of a god; and the myths about Osiris and Horus emphasize that rightful succession to the throne is essential to the maintenance of maat. Thus, mythology provided the rationale for <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> of Egyptian government.|$|E
25|$|The book {{opens with}} a female {{character}} named Aomame as she catches a taxi in Tokyo {{on her way to}} a work assignment. When the taxi gets stuck in a traffic jam, the driver suggests that she {{get out of the car}} and climb down an emergency escape in order to make it to her important meeting, though he warns her that doing so might change <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> of reality. Aomame makes her way to a hotel in Shibuya, where she poses as a hotel attendant in order to kill a hotel guest. She performs the murder with a tool that leaves almost no trace on its victim, leading investigators to conclude that he died a natural death from a heart failure.|$|E
