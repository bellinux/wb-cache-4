Reviewing PlayStation 3 Game of the Year edition, Digital Chumps and Spawn Kill confirmed that most bugs remained, citing occasional freezes, several animation and scripting issues, along with other bugs, requiring a restart of the game.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the Iraq war, there has been a {{tendency}} by both the Americans and the Europeans to overlook the difficulties facing the transatlantic relationship that resulted from the Iraq crisis. This approach <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> of the basic issues that emerged during this time is not a healthy one, and these issues must be discussed openly and seriously. This chapter addresses four important matters related to the Iraq crisis: the question of deterrence, whether or not weapons inspections should have been further pursued, pre-emption and its relation to international law, and the crisis that existed within the transatlantic alliance. While both sides have attempted to address these issues, they are in reality much more complex than initial assessments have indicated. The predicaments posed by the Iraq war for the transatlantic alliance are unlike those that the alliance faced during the Cold War, and Europeans must think carefully about what kind of alliance they foresee with the United States in the future.

500|$|Perot {{participated in}} the first of three presidential debates for the 1992 election, on October 11 in Clayton, Missouri, along with George Bush and Bill Clinton. It {{was the first time that}} a third party {{candidate}} was involved in a national televised debate since John B. Anderson in 1980, and was the first presidential debate to ever feature three candidates. During the event, Perot discussed a wide range of issues including the budget deficit, education and drug use, and proclaimed that as president, he would eliminate the influence of lobbyists. He also had a few memorable quips. When asked to address detractors' criticism of his lack of government experience, he remarked: [...] "Well, they've got a point. I don't have any experience running up a $4 trillion debt." [...] When discussing what would happen if one of his opponents won, he commented: [...] "then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do. I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music here tonight." [...] After the debate, three out of four polls declared Perot as the winner. The average of all four showed Perot at 37% followed by Clinton with 30% and Bush with 18%, but election polls still showed Perot in third with 14%, far behind both Bush and Clinton. His running mate, James Stockdale, participated in a Vice Presidential debate in Atlanta, with fellow Vice Presidential nominee Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle. Largely unknown to the general public, Stockdale memorably opened the debate by unexpectedly asking the philosophical question, [...] "Who am I? Why am I here?" [...] He was unprepared <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> of the substantive issues raised, and his struggling performance may have damaged the Perot campaign.|$|E

[...] "He tries <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> pretty serious and complex subjects by stringing together phrases that end with the same sound—whether they make sense together or not", Wendell critiqued. [...] "Sure, it's all subjective, but I can't myself see that {{what we need is}} 'Respect for the steeple/power to the people.'" [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau was also somewhat unmoved by the album's [...] "essentially middle-class guides to black pride" [...] but qualified his judgment as reflecting a certain degree of cultural relativism on his part, making note of African-American audiences having embraced the record.|$|E

40|$|Like any complex {{environmental}} problem, ecological {{risk assessment}} of the impacts of ionising radiation is confounded by uncertainty. At all stages, from problem formulation through to risk characterisation, the assessment is dependent on models, scenarios, assumptions and extrapolations. These include technical uncertainties related to the data used, conceptual uncertainties associated with models and scenarios, {{as well as social}} uncertainties such as economic impacts, the interpretation of legislation, and the acceptability of the assessment results to stakeholders. The ERICA Integrated Approach has been developed to allow an {{assessment of the}} risks of ionising radiation, and includes a number of methods that are intended to make the uncertainties and assumptions inherent in the assessment more transparent to users and stakeholders. Throughout its development, ERICA has recommended that assessors <b>deal</b> openly <b>with</b> the deeper dimensions of uncertainty and acknowledge that uncertainty is intrinsic to complex systems. Since the tool is based on a tiered approach, the approaches <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> uncertainty vary between the tiers, ranging from a simple, but highly conservative screening to a full probabilistic risk assessment including sensitivity analysis. This paper gives on overview of types of uncertainty that are manifest in ecological risk assessment and the ERICA Integrated Approach <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> of these uncertainties...|$|R

The German counter-attack was able to drive the British back from the green line along the Zonnebek–Langemarck road, pushing XIX Corps back to the black line.

The QA system can process the question statement in Chinese natural language fashion and find out the implicit intention of the user query. The question is split into four different terms, namely Subject term, Attribute term, Intention term and Interrogative term. These separate terms then are matched with the existing items in the FAQ corpus to get the proper or similar answers. The system interprets the document source to extract the semantic information for constructing Ontology, and this information is related to concepts such as human, event, time, place and entity.
