5|$|Albion's sole goalscoring {{opportunity}} {{of the second}} half came afterwards; Clark took the ball on a lengthy run before crossing it into the box, across an open goal with no Albion player there to tap <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> and put the game beyond QPR's reach. Fifteen minutes {{from the end of the}} match QPR equalised, Marsh's shot with his right foot went in off the post. A corner followed for QPR who were now dominating Albion with their style of play. Allen crossed it in to Lazarus, but the Albion goalkeeper saved the shot with his legs. With eight minutes to go, one of Albion defenders mis-kicked <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> their own penalty area. Hunt rushed in for the chance but Sheppard once again saved the game for Albion. The ball ran free to Mike Lazarus who tapped the ball into the back of an empty net to increase the scoreline to 3–2 in QPR's favour. A final attack from QPR came in the closing moments of the game as Lazarus took the ball past two defenders and into the box, his subsequent shot hit the outside of the post and went wide.|$|E
5|$|At Chelsea, Fàbregas {{played a}} similar playmaking role in midfield, using his technique, ball control, vision, and passing ability to dictate the tempo of his team's play, {{while he was}} {{supported}} by defensive midfielders, {{in order to give}} him more space and time on <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> <b>In</b> this deeper creative role, he excelled in Chelsea's new style of play under Mourinho, where he proved to be an effective assist-provider.|$|E
40|$|The {{classical}} Apollonius' {{problem is}} to construct circles that are tangent to three given circles in a plane. This problem was posed by Apollonius of Perga in his work "Tangencies". The Sylvester problem, which was introduced by the English mathematician J. J. Sylvester, asks for the smallest circle that encloses a finite collection of points in the plane. In this paper, we study the following generalized version of the Sylvester problem and its connection {{to the problem of}} Apollonius: given two finite collections of Euclidean <b>balls</b> <b>in</b> R^n, find <b>the</b> smallest Euclidean <b>ball</b> that encloses all of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first collection and intersects all of <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second collection. We also study a generalized version of the Fermat-Torricelli problem stated as follows: given two finite collections composed of three Euclidean <b>balls</b> <b>in</b> R^n, find a point that minimizes the sum of the farthest distances to <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first collection and shortest distances to <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second collection...|$|R

UConn received Buffalo's punt and were also unable to move the ball, going three-and-out and punting back to the Bulls.

5|$|Cleveland posted an 11–1 {{record in}} 1951, losing their only game to the San Francisco 49ers {{in the season}} opener. That gave the Browns another spot in the {{championship}} game, again against the Rams. This time, however, the Rams won 24–17. Graham fumbled <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> the third quarter, setting up a touchdown that put the Rams ahead 14–10. Three of his throws were intercepted, but he put up 280yards of passing and a touchdown. After the season, Graham was named the league's Most Valuable Player.|$|E

5|$|The {{conduct of}} Neymar, who {{performed}} tricks with <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> the closing stages of Barcelona's victory, was a talking point after the match.

However, Neymar himself did not apologise and said that he would repeat his behaviour in the future.|$|E

The interception was the final play of the third quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech in the lead, 3413.|$|E

Arsenal subsequently substituted Robert Pirès for Manuel Almunia, their substitute goalkeeper. The free-kick was sent wide by Ronaldinho. Following Lehmann's dismissal Barcelona began to exert more pressure on Arsenal, to the point where Emmanuel Eboué was cautioned for a high tackle.|$|E

Once the ball has been kicked, it can be caught and advanced by any member of the receiving team, and it can be recovered by the kicking team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least once or a player of the receiving team touches the ball.|$|E
5|$|After {{suffering}} {{an injury}} and being {{knocked out of}} Michigan's game with Nebraska (a 23–9 loss to the Cornhuskers) on October 27, Robinson returned to the lineup for the last home game of the 2012 season, a 42-17 victory over Iowa. Playing in his final game at Michigan Stadium, Robinson split his playing time between the tailback, quarterback, and wide receiver positions. He accounted for 122 yards, including 98 rushing yards on 13 carries and 24 receiving yards on two receptions. With the injury to the ulnar nerve in his right elbow, Robinson did not throw the ball during the game {{and was forced to}} carry <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> his right hand.|$|E
5|$|After the Kansas kickoff, Virginia Tech {{took over}} at its 33-yard line. Needing a score, the Hokies {{committed}} a five-yard false start penalty before quarterback Sean Glennon was sacked by Kansas' Mike Rivera. The two plays pushed the Virginia Tech offense back, {{preventing them from}} gaining a first down. Forced to punt the ball away, Virginia Tech had to play defense as Kansas took over at its 28-yard line. Secure in their lead, Kansas elected to run <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> {{an effort to keep}} the clock moving and bring the game to an end more quickly. Brandon McAnderson broke free for 28yards on the first play of the drive, and Jake Sharp contributed another first down on the ground before the Hokie defense stopped Kansas on an attempt to earn a first down on a fourth-and-two deep inside Virginia Tech territory.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{excellent}} field position, Virginia Tech seemed in position for an easy score. However, after a quick Tech first down, the Georgia defense stiffened and Tech was forced to settle for a field goal. The 28-yard kick by Brandon Pace cut Georgia's lead to 31–24, but only 3:42 remained on the clock. Due to the short time remaining, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick in order to have another chance at offense. The kick was recovered by Georgia, however, and the Bulldogs proceeded to rush <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> three consecutive plays, forcing the Hokies to use their last timeout in order to conserve time for one final drive.|$|E
5|$|At the time, 404 {{would have}} been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach their target, and the local press wrote them off, {{predicting}} that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour spin bowlers. Morris and Hassett started slowly, scoring only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch offering spin and bounce. It appeared they were playing carefully at first before deciding whether to try to achieve the target at a later point. In Bedser's second over, the third of the innings, Morris chipped <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>in</b> the air towards mid-wicket, in a similar manner to his first innings dismissal, but this time the ball evaded Cranston. After 15 minutes, Australia had only made 0/10.|$|E

On 21 February 2015, Barton received the ninth red card {{of his career in}} the 32nd minute of a match against Hull City after swinging at Tom Huddlestone's groin following a foul by Darnell Furlong.
