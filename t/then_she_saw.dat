25|$|At 16:30, a local witness heard 50 to 60 shots fired, <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> the {{helicopter}} skimming {{over an open}} field {{just north of the}} border, near Derrygorry, in the Republic. The Gazelle, serial number ZB687, was hit by several rounds and lost oil pressure. The crew were forced to crash-land the machine, which broke up on impact. The RUC and British Army sealed off the scene as an investigation was mounted. The official report confirmed that the Gazelle had been on a reconnaissance flight. Three crew members were wounded in the crash, one of them a sergeant major from the KOSB, who suffered spinal injuries. None of the injured was hit by gunfire. Another crewmember survived unscathed. The incident was covered by an ITN news report, which shows {{the helicopter}} wreckage being examined by Army technicians. The remains were kept under armed guard for further forensic analysis for several days before being removed from the field.|$|E
60|$|And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> {{that it was}} true; {{this woman}} was the sort who understood.|$|E
60|$|She turned {{round in}} surprise, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> the little creature, the Golden Crab.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then,</b> when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> {{that her}} child was gone, Nandie {{spoke for the}} first time.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Then</b> as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> {{nothing but}} sullen faces {{around her and}} not a word broke the silence that ensued, she {{continued}} more calmly: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear, another poor man," [...] <b>she</b> said, pityingly. <b>Then,</b> as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> his face, [...] "Great Heavens, it is Isaac! Oh! don't {{say he is}} dead!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> {{the old man}} returning, and he had {{the bottle}} in his hand.|$|E
60|$|Steps came, and Nanny shrieked. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> it was {{her husband}} {{and the other two}} men.|$|E
60|$|Josephine laughed. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> Phipps {{standing}} {{in the background and}} she raised her voice a little.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> first <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> her ain fair face, And {{then the}} glass grew white, And syne {{as black as}} the mouth o' Hell Or the sky on a winter night.|$|R
60|$|A {{gleam of}} {{pleasure}} passing {{across her face}} was instantly obscured behind the cloud of her stolidity. <b>Then,</b> as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> Hilary move nearer to the door, her lip began to droop.|$|R
60|$|Now {{she awoke}} {{in a great}} sweat; also a {{trembling}} was upon her; but after a while, she fell to sleeping again. And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> thought <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> Christian her husband {{in a place of}} bliss, among many immortals, with a harp in his hand, standing and playing upon it before One that sat upon a throne, with a rainbow about His head.|$|R
60|$|The mirth in {{the dark}} corners of his eyes {{disturbed}} her more and more. And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> that the President was laughing.|$|E
60|$|She did not understand. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> {{from under}} one of the exultant tentacles upon his cheek there trickled a little thread of blood.|$|E
60|$|Why had she {{to do all}} {{the work}} to secure their love? It wasn't fair. And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> his eyes, adoring and distressed.|$|E
60|$|He turned {{towards her}} <b>then,</b> and <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> {{the light in}} his face for which she had longed. With a little cry her head sank upon his shoulder, and his arms closed around her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, he didn't really pitch. He just humped {{up a few}} times," [...] replied Flo, and <b>then</b> when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> how Carley {{was going}} to take it she burst into a merry peal of laughter. Charley, the sheep herder was grinning, {{and some of the other}} men turned away with shaking shoulders.|$|R
25|$|<b>She</b> <b>then</b> <b>saw</b> {{service in}} West, South and East Africa {{until the end}} of WW1. She was sold for {{breaking}} in October 1921.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> Tavernake {{and said}} no more. She seemed to sway a little, and Tavernake, taking a quick step forward, grasped her by the hands.|$|E
60|$|He turned quickly, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> the glow. But {{it was the}} old glow, not the new--the {{light in}} which her early years had been spent.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> {{the absurdity}} of her idea, of any such miracle of sympathy. He was entirely {{concentrated}} upon the appeal he had come prepared to make.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn't {{say just}} that. Both of them wrote {{a great deal}} of trash," [...] said Miss Oliver dryly. <b>Then,</b> repenting, as <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> a hurt look in Rilla's eye, she added hastily, ...|$|R
60|$|It was <b>then</b> that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> {{with whom}} <b>she</b> had to deal; the lady was {{undoubtedly}} Mrs. Soames, {{the young man}} Mr. Bosinney. Concealing herself rapidly over {{the purchase of a}} box of Tunisian dates, for she was impatient of awkwardly meeting people with parcels in her hands, and at the busy time of the morning, she was quite unintentionally an interested observer of their little interview.|$|R
6000|$|Now {{she awoke}} {{in a great}} sweat, also a {{trembling}} was upon her; {{but after a while}} she fell to sleeping again. And <b>then</b> <b>she</b> thought <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> Christian her husband in a place of bliss, among many immortals, with a harp in his hand, standing and playing upon it before One that sat on a throne, with a rainbow about His head. <b>She</b> <b>saw</b> also as if he bowed his head, with his face to the paved work that was under the Prince's feet, saying, I heartily thank my Lord and King, for bringing of me into this place. Then shouted a company of them that stood round about, and harped with their harps; but no man living could tell what they said, but Christian and his companions.[20] ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> us both go--the doctor {{back to his}} bed and me to a settle with {{mattress}} on it, {{which was}} placed just outside his door.|$|E
60|$|She {{felt the}} drawing {{power of his}} eyes; and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> him look at the bound Venters, and at the men who held him, and their leader.|$|E
60|$|Five minutes passed, and <b>then</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> a boat lowered and manned. The oars were got out, and {{presently}} it was backing water {{within ten}} paces of her.|$|E
5000|$|Chuck and Casey rush back to {{his house}} and begin searching for the missing Marlin. During their search they are {{interrupted}} by Ellie. Anticipating {{he may not be}} able to see her again, Chuck tells her goodbye [...] "just in case." [...] <b>She</b> <b>then</b> tells him <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> Morgan leaving with the fish.|$|R
60|$|Both Lightfoot {{and the big}} {{stranger}} were handsome. Yes, indeed, {{they were}} very handsome. Lightfoot {{was just a little}} bit the bigger and it seemed to her just a little bit the handsomer. She almost wanted him to win. <b>Then,</b> when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> how bravely the big stranger was fighting and how well he was holding his own, even though he was a little smaller than Lightfoot, she almost hoped he would win.|$|R
60|$|And <b>then</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>she</b> {{was going}} to start something, and I bleated weakly to Jeeves to bring me tea. But she had begun before I could get it.|$|R
6000|$|She {{remained}} there, however; Maisie saw {{the pair}} {{look at each}} other. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> Mrs. Beale turn to her. [...] "I'm your mother now, Maisie. And he's your father." ...|$|E
60|$|She passed {{beyond the}} pines {{and scanned the}} path ahead {{as far as the}} stile. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> him, lying where he had flung himself, face {{downward}} among the bluebells.|$|E
60|$|Cynthia halted, with {{apparent}} unwillingness, {{and put out}} her toe {{between the}} pickets. <b>Then</b> <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> {{that there was a}} little patch on that toe, and drew it in again.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} stand there with her, but sat indoors {{watching}} her, with my heart hardly beating, and my hands grasping tightly {{the arms of the}} chair, as if to keep down the wild impulse which prompted me to rush madly down to the station to see the paper. At last Polly moved, and then went up the road, out of my sight, and I knew <b>then</b> that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> Harry coming back again, and that the news was in.|$|R
5000|$|Alexia and Hayley {{attend the}} Winter Festival dance, where Hayley breaks down and tells Alexia that they can't switch back. Alexia <b>then</b> confesses that <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> the first {{shooting}} star {{when she was}} with Kyle and wished to be Hayley, since she had been jealous of Hayley's intellect and well-structured plans for her future.|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't understand," [...] he said, [...] "who I am or what I am. I'll show you. By Heaven! I'll show you." [...] Then he put {{his open}} palm over his face and withdrew it. The centre of his face became a black cavity. [...] "Here," [...] he said. He stepped forward and handed Mrs. Hall {{something}} which she, staring at his metamorphosed face, accepted automatically. <b>Then,</b> when <b>she</b> <b>saw</b> what it was, she screamed loudly, dropped it, and staggered back. The nose--it was the stranger's nose! pink and shining--rolled on the floor.|$|R
