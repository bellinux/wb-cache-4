5|$|Approximately 1000 {{passengers}} {{were trapped in}} darkness for several hours inside two Eurostar trains {{on the night of}} 19/20 February 1996. The trains stopped inside the tunnels due to electronic failures caused by snow and ice.

5|$|From {{the time}} of the battle until several months later, almost all Allied {{supplies}} and reinforcements sent to Guadalcanal came by transports in small convoys, mainly during daylight hours, while Allied aircraft from the New Hebrides and Henderson Field and any available aircraft carriers flew covering missions. During this time, Allied forces on Guadalcanal received barely enough ammunition and provisions <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> several Japanese drives to retake the islands.|$|E

5|$|Full-scale armour trials {{revealed}} serious {{weaknesses in}} the proposed protection scheme. The trials employed the obsolete ironclad , modified with armour protection identical to that used by the s then under construction. The deck and turret roof armour proved to be too thin, and the structure supporting the side armour was not strong enough <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> shock of impact from heavy shells.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the Somali studies scholar Charles Geshekter {{produced}} The Parching Winds of Somalia. Shot {{on location}} in Somalia, the film examines how the country's nomadic inhabitants managed <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> ravages of a harsh desert environment and the encroachment of imperial forces by synthesizing knowledge of the past, Muslim practices, and skillful livestock management in a successful fusion of traditional values with modern techniques.|$|E

40|$|Odvaljni bat, ki ga izdeluje Goodyear EPE(Engineerd Products Europe), prenese vse obremenitve, ki jih zahtevajo evropski tehnični standardi, v primeru, ko je podprt po celotni spodnji površini. Če je odvaljni bat podprt samo po delu površine, ne prenese vseh zahtevanih obremenitev. Za rešitev problema je bila najprej narejena trdnostna analiza odvaljnega bata, nato pa je bil bat spremenjen, tako da je zdržal vse zahtevane obremenitve. An air-spring piston, {{produced}} by Goodyear EPE(Engineered Products Europe), is able <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> all <b>the</b> loads {{that are required}} by European Engineering Standards when it is supported on its entire lower surface. When the piston was only supported {{on a part of}} the lower surface it was not able <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> all <b>the</b> loads. <b>To</b> solve this problem we made a strength analysis of the existing piston. The piston was modified so that it was able <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> all <b>the</b> required loads...|$|R

5|$|Previous {{practices}} had required ships <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> flooding of {{a single}} forward hold, but did not guard against situations where two holds would flood. The case where two after (rear) holds are flooded is no better, because the engine room is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion. If two holds {{in the middle of}} the ship are flooded, the stress on the hull can become so great that the ship snaps in two.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the typhoon's {{arrival in}} China, {{officials}} evacuated 467,900people, {{many of them}} to government shelters across the region. It was estimated that about 30% of coastal houses were too weak <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> winds from the typhoon. In addition, officials ordered the closure of all restaurants and entertainment venues. Ferry service near Shanghai was disrupted, and 9,900ships were moved to safer areas. In addition, several airports across the region were closed, including in Shanghai.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1140, Theobald consecrated Uhtred as Bishop of Llandaff, with Uhtred also {{swearing}} to obey Theobald. Likewise, when Theobald consecrated Gilbert as Bishop of St Asaph in 1142, {{a similar}} profession of obedience was made. Along with these consecrations, Theobald's legal efforts enabled him <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> attempts of Bernard to turn St David's into an archbishopric, and when Bernard was succeeded by David fitzGerald in 1148, Theobald secured the new bishop's profession of obedience to Canterbury, thus ending {{the efforts to}} remove Wales from Canterbury's jurisdiction. Also in 1148, Pope Eugene decided in favour of Canterbury and against the claims of St David's, securing Canterbury's jurisdiction over Wales.|$|E

5|$|At Passo de Torres, many shipyards were destroyed, as {{they were}} not {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> pressure differentials caused by Catarina's winds; widespread roof damage was reported at this municipality as well. Near the Mampituba River, a house was blown about 50meters (165ft) upstream, literally landing in another state: it originally {{was built in the}} Torres municipality of Rio Grande do Sul, yet it ended up in Passo de Torres, within Santa Catarina. In rural areas, the corn, banana, and rice fields received the most damage, although rice farmers were able to partially recoup their losses, as they had harvested before Catarina made landfall.|$|E
5|$|Following the Palomares and Thule accidents—the only {{cases where}} the {{conventional}} explosives of U.S. nuclear bombs accidentally detonated and dispersed nuclear materials—investigators concluded the high explosive (HE) used in nuclear weapons was not chemically stable enough <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> forces involved in an aircraft accident. They also determined that the electrical circuits of the weapons' safety devices became unreliable in a fire and allowed connections to short circuit. The findings triggered research by scientists in the United States into safer conventional explosives and fireproof casings for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|He {{is known}} to have absorbed the {{abilities}} of Luke Cage, Vision, Red Hulk and Protector, and it is suggested that he also absorbed the abilities of his current Dark Avengers. In his final form, his body grew to the Hulk's size, and like Hulk he was capable of creating shockwaves by hitting the ground or smashing his hands together. His durability was sufficient <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> combined attacks of all the Avengers, and he demonstrated remarkable healing abilities, recovering in seconds after Daisy Johnson used her powers to make his heart explode. He could also turn intangible by manipulating his density, as the Vision does.|$|E

5|$|In the past, the Newfoundland pony {{was used}} for ploughing, {{assisting}} with gardens, hauling kelp from the beaches, gathering hay, and carrying wood, and they were also used for transportation. They were successfully used and bred <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> hard climate, and by 1935 there were over 9,000 ponies on the island. During the mid-20th century, however, increasing mechanization and a ban on free-roaming ponies contributed {{to a decline in}} the population, and increased exports to France for horse meat in the 1970s almost led to the extinction of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the more}} seriously damaged homes were of simple construction, with walls made of mud, adobe, or brick packed 40–50cm (16–20in) thick. These {{materials}} are generally more vulnerable to {{the force of the}} earthquake, but some of the traditionally constructed homes sustained little or no damage. This was due to a range of factors, possibly including the height-to-width ratio, the lack of windows, {{and the quality of the}} materials used. In general, reinforced concrete-framed homes, built after the 1979 earthquake, were better able <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> earthquake. Those near the epicenter still sustained severe damage due to the weight of the roofs and the weak joint connections between major structural elements of the buildings.|$|E
5|$|On {{an early}} test run the R engine {{produced}} 1,400hp (1,040kW) and was noted to idle happily at 450revolutions per minute (rpm). With increased boost ratings and fuel developed by Banks, the R engine ultimately developed 2,530hp (1,890kW) at 3,200rpm; well over double the maximum power {{output of the}} Buzzard. The engine was further tested and cleared for limited sprint racing at 2,783hp (2,075kW) at 3,400rpm and +21lb (1.45bar) of boost, but this capability was not used due to concerns with the S.6B's airframe not being able <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>the</b> power, and {{the inability of the}} aircraft to lift the extra fuel required to meet the increased consumption.|$|E
