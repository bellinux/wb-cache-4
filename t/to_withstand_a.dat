5|$|Despite the modifications, it was {{realized}} that the walls of Valletta were not strong enough <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>a</b> long siege. In 1635, construction of the Floriana Lines commenced, enclosing Valletta's land front. The Floriana Lines were also modified until the 18th century. Later on, the suburb of Floriana developed in the area between the Floriana Lines and the Valletta Land Front, {{and it is now}} a town in its own right.|$|E
5|$|The Swedes {{had fought}} bravely. Salzback had {{personally}} dispatched 8 men. But their losses were heavy, over 2,000 {{men had been}} killed, almost half the force while the allies had lost 1,900 men. The defenses at Nyborg was in no condition <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>a</b> siege. There was nothing for the Swedish to do but to surrender, forcing 5,000 men into captivity; Sweden had suffered a devastating defeat.|$|E
5|$|The Vanport flood {{induced changes}} to the slough's system of levees, which were rebuilt {{and in some cases}} {{fortified}} <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>a</b> 100-year flood. Instead of repairing the levee along the Peninsula Canal, the city plugged it at both ends. The disaster also affected Oregon's system of higher education. After floodwaters destroyed the Vanport Extension Center, set up in 1946, the Oregon Board of Higher Education reestablished the school in downtown Portland, where it eventually became Portland State University.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{a company}} spokesman, Indian Point was built <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>an</b> {{earthquake}} of 6.1 on the Richter scale. Entergy executives have also noted [...] "that Indian Point had been designed <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>an</b> earthquake much stronger than any on record in the region, though not one as powerful as the quake that rocked Japan." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{electrical}} engineering and materials science, the coercivity, {{also called the}} magnetic coercivity, coercive field or coercive force, {{is a measure of}} the ability of <b>a</b> ferromagnetic material <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>an</b> external magnetic field without becoming demagnetized. An analogous property, electric coercivity, is the ability of <b>a</b> ferroelectric material <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>an</b> external electric field without becoming depolarized.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{investigate}} the capability of additive manufacturing technologies to build pressure housings, hemispheres made of titanium and ceramic with a nominal outer diameter of 70 mm were built on 3 D printer systems, evaluated, and tested in a pressure tank. Titanium hemispheres expected <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>an</b> external pressure of 10 MPa started buckling at 6 MPa. A stiffened titanium hemisphere which was expected <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> 24 MPa collapsed at 30 MPa. A ceramic hemisphere could not be tested to collapse since the measurement technique was not rated <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>an</b> external pressure above 30 MPa...|$|R
5|$|The {{ballpark}} {{was built}} <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>a</b> 100-year flood {{because it is}} located on a flood plain. Before its redevelopment, the area, including the original Sulphur Dell ballpark, was prone to regular flooding from the nearby Cumberland River and it flooded during the 2010 Tennessee floods. To prevent water damage, the grandstand has an acrylic floor covering and the field-level suites are equipped with detachable floor boards, food-service tables mounted on casters, and raised floor outlets and electrical switches.|$|E
5|$|The type of pastry used is not defined, {{as long as}} it {{is golden}} in colour and will not crack during the cooking or cooling, {{although}} modern pasties almost always use a shortcrust pastry. There is a humorous belief that the pastry on a good pasty should be strong enough <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>a</b> drop down a mine shaft, and indeed the barley flour that was usually used does make hard dense pastry.|$|E
5|$|Under Venetian rule, a small harbour {{was built}} in Rethymno, which became the third most {{important}} city on Crete after Heraklion and Chania. On 8 April 1540, a line of fortifications began to be built around the city. The walls were designed by the architect Michele Sanmicheli, and were completed in around 1570. These fortifications were not strong enough <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>a</b> large assault, and when Uluç Ali Reis attacked in 1571, the Ottomans captured and sacked the city.|$|E
50|$|On 19 September 1985, {{the tower}} <b>withstood</b> <b>a</b> {{magnitude}} 8.1 earthquake, {{as well as}} other strong earthquakes that commonly strike Mexico City. The building was designed <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>an</b> earthquake of 8.5 on the Richter scale.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes. They had {{suffered}} heavily from cholera; and {{as there was}} now no fear that the Egyptians and Soudanese would prove unequal <b>to</b> <b>withstanding</b> <b>a</b> Dervish rush, there was no necessity for keeping them here." ...|$|R
5|$|With the {{development}} of new technologies, by the 17th century it was realised that while Valletta's fortifications were well designed, they were not strong enough <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>a</b> heavy attack. Because of this, the Floriana Lines, encircling Valletta's original land front, were built from 1635 to the 1640s. In the 18th century, a suburb developed between the Floriana Lines and Valletta's land front, and it became known as Floriana, today a town in its own right.|$|E
5|$|Although usually sedate and approachable underwater, Pacific {{angelsharks}} {{are quick}} to bite if touched, captured, or otherwise provoked, and can inflict severe lacerations. Commercial fisheries for this species exist off Baja California {{and to a lesser}} extent off California (see below); the meat is considered excellent and is sold fresh or frozen. This species is captured in limited numbers by recreational fishers using hook-and-line, spears, or even by hand, particularly off southern California. It is also taken as bycatch in shrimp trawls operating in the Gulf of California, and processed into fishmeal. The capacity of this species <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>a</b> focused fishing effort is limited, due to its low rates of reproduction and movement.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1632 a well-prepared Russian army took a number of strongholds on the Lithuanian {{side of the border}} and {{commenced}} a siege of Smolensk. The well-fortified city was able <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>a</b> general onslaught followed by a ten-month encirclement by an overwhelming force led by Mikhail Shein. At that time a Commonwealth rescue expedition of comparable strength arrived, under the highly effective military command of Władysław IV. After months of fierce fighting, in February 1634 Shein capitulated. The Treaty of Polyanovka confirmed the Deulino territorial arrangements with small adjustments in favor of the Tsardom. Władysław had relinquished, upon monetary compensation, his claims to the Russian throne.|$|E

25|$|Some main {{innovations}} of the W124 series {{were related}} to occupant safety. Derived from the Mercedes 190 (W201), with which the W124 shares the basic layout, its likewise angular body was designed <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>an</b> offset-crash in a concrete barrier at some 35mph (56km/h) without serious harm to the occupants and a largely undamaged passenger cabin, a windshield that stays in place and doors easily opened without special recovery tools. This crash-test configuration became the base for the Euro-NCAP procedure currently being the standard crash-test configuration in the EU. Unlike Euro-NCAP, Mercedes required {{the body of the}} W124 <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>an</b> offset impact from the front and from the rear.|$|R
5000|$|Rathfarnham was {{described}} as a [...] "waste village" [...] when Loftus bought it. His new castle was not long built when in 1600 it had <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>an</b> attack by the Wicklow clans during the Nine Years' War.|$|R
5|$|The Chino Hills {{earthquake}} caused no deaths {{or significant}} damage {{due to the}} physical location of its epicenter. Most of the infrastructure in the Chino Hills area is relatively new and well suited <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>a</b> large quake. Unlike previous earthquakes in the region—such as the 1994 Northridge earthquake and the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, which caused serious structural damage and fatalities—this quake caused only minor damage. However, the high volume of telephone use following the shock overloaded provider capacity and disrupted service into the afternoon.|$|E
5|$|The {{storm was}} {{initially}} expected {{to move into}} the Gulf of Mexico and affect people recovering from hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma in the previous year, which caused hundreds of billion in damage and left thousands of houses damaged or destroyed. There were initial fears that Ernesto would make landfall days after Hurricane Katrina's one-year anniversary, and that the levees in New Orleans might not be able <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>a</b> strong storm surge. Officials in New Orleans prepared buses and trains in the event that people needed to evacuate but could not. A possible path over the Gulf of Mexico oil fields, as well as tension with Iran, caused the price of oil to increase, although the prices receded when the threat of the storm receded.|$|E
5|$|Two earlier {{business}} decisions by the Chicago Sun-Times led to substantial savings {{of time and}} money during the Trump Tower's construction. The original 1950s sea wall was built by the newspaper company to bomb-shelter thickness, <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>a</b> Cold War attack, and thus {{did not have to be}} broken down and rebuilt. Furthermore, the company decided in the 1970s to switch from petroleum-based to soy-based ink, which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant. This considerably reduced the costs and time for cleaning up the site prior to building anew.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant has}} been {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>an</b> earthquake of magnitude 8.5. Sand hills of up to 15 m height provide defence against a tsunami of up to 8 m high, but Hamaoka currently lacks a concrete sea barrier.|$|R
50|$|Minister of Electric Power Zaw Min {{claimed that}} the dam was {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>an</b> earthquake of 8.0 Richter Scale, a scale {{that has never been}} recorded to have occurred in that region, and the most devastating flood of a millennium.|$|R
50|$|The cockpit {{walls and}} windows are very thick, able <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>an</b> engine explosion. Additionally, the cockpit is {{detachable}} and {{is equipped with}} two rocket propelled parachutes (main and back-up). The aircraft {{will have a very}} large recovery parachute and a smaller anti-stall parachute.|$|R
5|$|Unlike semiaquatic temnospondyls, {{terrestrial}} temnospondyls have skulls {{that are}} adapted for biting land-living prey. The sutures between {{the bones of}} the skull in the dissorophoid Phonerpeton are able <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>a</b> high degree of compression. Compressive forces would have been experienced when biting down on prey. Earlier aquatic tetrapods and tetrapod ancestors differ from temnospondyls like Phonerpeton in that their skulls were also built to withstand tension. This tension would have been experienced during suction feeding underwater. Temnospondyls like Phonerpeton were among the first tetrapods that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting.|$|E
5|$|While Charles and Moreau jockeyed for {{position}} on the eastern slope of the Black Forest, Franz Petrasch engaged the French at Bruchsal. The troops there, commanded by Marc Amand Élisée Scherb, included the 68th Demi-brigade and two squadrons of the 19th Dragoons; they had remained behind after the Battle of Ettlingen to observe the garrisons of Mannheim and Philippsburg. Realizing that his command was too small <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>a</b> concerted attack by the stronger Austrians, Scherb withdrew toward Kehl to secure the Rhine crossing to Strasburg, since Moreau, now well into a retreat across the mountains, would need the crossing for a safe passage to France.|$|E
5|$|At de Launay's request, an {{additional}} force of 32 {{soldiers from the}} Swiss Salis-Samade regiment {{had been assigned to}} the Bastille on 7 July, adding to the existing 82 invalides pensioners who formed the regular garrison. De Launay had taken various precautions, raising the drawbridge in the Comté tower and destroying the stone abutment that linked the Bastille to its bastion to prevent anyone from gaining access from that side of the fortress. The shops in the entranceway to the Bastille had been closed and the gates locked. The Bastille was defended by 30 small artillery pieces, but nonetheless, by 14 July de Launay was very concerned about the Bastille's situation. The Bastille, already hugely unpopular with the revolutionary crowds, was now the only remaining royalist stronghold in central Paris, in addition to which he was protecting a recently arrived stock of 250 barrels of valuable gunpowder. To make matters worse, the Bastille had only two days' supply of food and no source of water, making it impossible <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>a</b> long siege.|$|E
50|$|PMD has {{two main}} runways, runways: 4/22, and 7/25, {{and both are}} over 2 mi long. 7/25 was built <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>an</b> 8.3 Richter Scale earthquake, {{making it one of}} the world's strongest runways. Another smaller runway, 72/252, is used as an assault strip.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effects of}} {{traditional}} explosions like blast-forces and metal fragments seldom disable armored vehicles, but the explosively formed solid copper penetrator is quite lethal [...] - {{even to the}} new generation of mine-resistant vehicles (which are made <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>an</b> anti-tank mine), and many tanks.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{after the}} Norman Conquest, William the Conqueror {{recognised}} {{the importance of}} securing the loyalty of the West Country and thus the need to secure Exeter. The city managed <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>an</b> eighteen-day siege and the new king was only eventually allowed to enter upon honourable terms.|$|R
5|$|Banksia serrata plants {{generally}} become fire tolerant by five {{to seven}} years of age in that they are able to resprout afterwards. Regrowth is generally from epicormic buds under their thick bark if the plant is between 2 and 6m (7-20ft) high or possibly from the woody subterranean base known as the lignotuber of younger and smaller plants. There is doubt as to whether recovery from a lignotuber is possible, although it has been demonstrated in other Banksia species such as B. menziesii. Stem size is a critical factor; stems with a DBH of under 1cm (0.4in) are unable to withstand low intensity fires. A stem/trunk DBH of 2cm (0.8in) is needed to survive low intensity fires and of around 5cm (2in) <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>a</b> high intensity fire.|$|E
5|$|By 1782, the Johnsons {{had moved}} to Bryan's Station (future Lexington) in Fayette County. Johnson's mother was {{considered}} among the heroic women of the community because of her actions during Simon Girty's raid on Bryan's Station in August 1782. According to tradition, as Girty's forces surrounded the fort, the occupants discovered that they had almost no water inside <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>a</b> siege. Several Indians had concealed themselves near the spring outside the fort. The Kentuckians reasoned that the Indians would stay hidden until they attacked. Jemima Johnson approved {{a plan for the}} women to go alone and collect water from the spring as usual. Many men disapproved of the plan, fearing the women would be attacked and killed. However, faced with no other option they finally agreed. Shortly after sunrise, the women went to the spring and returned without incident.|$|E
5|$|F. Augustus Heinze's {{association}} with the corner and the insolvent State Savings Bank proved {{too much for the}} board of the Mercantile to accept. Although they forced him to resign before lunch time, by then it was too late. As news of the collapse spread, depositors rushed en masse to withdraw money from the Mercantile National Bank. The Mercantile had enough capital <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> <b>a</b> few days of withdrawals, but depositors began to pull cash from the banks of the Heinzes' associate Charles W. Morse. Runs occurred at Morse's National Bank of North America and the New Amsterdam National. Afraid of the impact the tainted reputations of Augustus Heinze and Morse could have on the banking system, the New York Clearing House (a consortium of the city's banks) forced Morse and Heinze to resign all banking interests. By the weekend after the failed corner, there was not yet systemic panic. Funds were withdrawn from Heinze-associated banks, only to be deposited with other banks in the city.|$|E
