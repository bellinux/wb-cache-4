The first part of the article deals with the description of the structure and mechanical properties of the interfacial phases and their arrangement. The main part of the article {{is aimed at}} study of brittle intermetallic phases, which arise due to increased temperature. For this reason, a set of samples of steel CSN 11   321 (DC 01) was prepared.

40|$|It is {{problematic}} {{to heat up}} Low-E glass in a traditional radiation type furnace, because the glass will bend during the heating cycle which leads to different problems such as viscoelastic changes, coating distortion, surface defects, uneven bending etc. If we add forced convection to radiation furnaces it becomes possible to temper Low-E glass with the current manufacturing methods on the market. However, the emissivity requirements will be lowered {{in the future and}} for this reason we need new manufacturing solutions. One such solution is the use of convection in <b>tempering</b> <b>furnaces.</b> This paper will give you an idea about the latest developments and test results in this field...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{heat transfer}} model of glass plates {{heating and cooling}} has been developed to study their thermal <b>tempering.</b> The <b>furnace</b> being modeled is of a tunnel type, in which the glass plate alternates translational motions with back and forth mouvements with a specified law. An appropriate implementation of a moving (transient) convection/radiation boundary condition has been proposed to describe the heat transfer exchanged between the glass surfaces and the furnace environment. The model results have been experimentally validated by a scanning pyrometer which detects the pointwise temperature of the upper surface of the plate at the exit of the furnace. © 2004 American Institute of Physic...|$|R

40|$|Hot-formed {{martensitic}} {{boron steel}} plate offers very high strength {{and is therefore}} useful in car bodies in areas where deformation should be kept to a minimum, like the safety cage. However, cracks may initiate around spot welds during mechanical loading. The problem mainly originates from the lower yield strength in the heat-affected zones (HAZ) {{as compared to the}} surrounding structure, causing strain localization. In this project the possibility to prevent cracking by induction tempering before spot welding has been investigated. The idea has been to distribute strains and avoid localization around welds. Tensile tests have been performed on samples <b>tempered</b> in <b>furnace</b> and by induction heating, with and without spot welds. The results show that the weakening effect from the spot weld can be eliminated by a tempering operation. Further, high strain rate 3 -point drop tower tests have been performed on full scale B-pillars with and without tempered flanges. B-pillars with tempered flanges show promising results compared to fully hardened. According to the results additional kinetic energy absorption of 30 % at crack initiation was observed...|$|R
40|$|Innovation opens new {{opportunities}} {{in the field of}} processing hollow semi-products, as it offers the potential for manufacturing complex-shaped structural parts with enhanced properties. This introduces a manufacturing route comprising the following steps: internal high pressure forming, hot stamping and thermomechanical Q&P processing. In this manufacturing route, the demonstration product, a tube–shaped stock, is first austenitized. It is then expanded in a closed die by internal pressure of nitrogen until the material touches the die wall. As a result, it cools down quickly and martensite begins to form. At a temperature above the Mf, the cooling is interrupted and the workpiece is transferred to a <b>furnace</b> and <b>tempered.</b> The <b>furnace</b> temperature is below the Ms temperature. Within several minutes, a mixed microstructure forms, consisting of martensite and stabilized retained austenite. Thanks to this microstructure, the material exhibits a favourable combination of high strength and adequate ductility. Martensite imparts sufficient strength to the material whereas the retained austenite provides ductility. At a carbon level of approximately 0. 4  % and with a simple Si-Mn-Cr-based chemistry, strengths of 2000 [*]MPa and A 5 [*]mm elongations of 15 % can be achieved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{non-destructive}} evaluation of surface oxidation of gear steel using magnetic Barkhausen noise profiles analysis. Martensitic specimens are subjected to tempering at various temperatures in a muffle <b>furnace.</b> <b>Tempering</b> induced changes result in Barkhausen profile height increase and peak centers shift to lower fields. Single peak profiles are associated with specimens tempered up to 500 °C. Double peak profiles are seen with specimens tempered at 600 °C and 700 °C. Single peak profiles are observed after removing the oxide layer. The utilization of MBN method for this purpose {{is based on the}} difference in the inherent magnetic properties between the degraded surface layer and the sub-surface unaffected bulk. The observations are discussed in the light of established models of Barkhausen noise...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} ensure a high {{passenger}} safety and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, dual-phase (DP) and martensitic steels (MS) are increasingly {{being used in the}} automotive industries. However, the main issue in the welding of steels containing a metastable martensite phase is softening, which occurs in the sub-critical heat affected zone (SCHAZ) and deteriorates joint integrity. This work attempts to understand the martensite tempering kinetics involved during high-speed laser beam welding where steels are exposed to the rapid heating and cooling cycles. Fiber laser welding was performed on DP steel and its dissimilar combination with high strength low alloy (HSLA) steel. Different zones that produced at heat affected zone (HAZ) were characterized with respect to microstructure, micro- and nano-hardness, and tensile testing. Microstructural characterization suggests that the as-received martensite phase decomposes in the SCHAZ and forms various shapes and sizes of carbides, which reduces the local microhardness of the steel and subsequently the sample fractured in this zone during tensile loading. In addition, the chemical composition and microstructure of DP steel {{plays an important role in}} the tempering reaction kinetics. The study conducted on the DP 780 steel composed of ferrite, martensite, and bainite microconstituents, exhibited increasing microhardness in the HAZ instead of softening. This phenomenon is referred to as “secondary hardening”. Rapid isothermal tempering conducted in a Gleeble simulator also indicated occurrence of secondary hardening at 500 °C, as confirmed by plotting the tempered microhardness against the Holloman-Jaffe parameter. The mechanism of secondary hardening in this kind of a steel was unveiled by advanced characterization techniques carried out using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging. The experimental results suggested that the cementite (Fe 3 C) and TiC phases located in the bainite phase of DP 780 steel decomposed upon rapid tempering to form needle-shaped Mo 2 C and plate-shaped M 4 C 3 carbides giving rise to secondary hardening. In order to investigate the influences of steel microstructure on the martensite tempering kinetics two commercially produced DP 980 grade steels were used. The study suggests that the severity of martensite tempering can be avoided by modifying the microstructure of the steels; the DP 980 steel produced with a combination of martensite, ferrite, and a blocky retained austenite phase promotes high tensile strength of the laser welded joint similar to the un-welded material. Strength of the tempered martensite significantly differed depending on the nature of the tempering mode and heat input. Therefore, tempered martensite obtained from four different tempering modes was investigated. Extensive recovery and reduction of boundary regions was identified on the structure tempered slowly, whereas rapidly tempered structures retained a high density of dislocations and less decomposition of the lath structure. The study revealed that dislocation density has a prominent effect on the macroscopic strength of the tempered martensite over all other strength contributors. In addition, rapid thermal cycles retained a high density of dislocations after tempering thus improving the tempered martensite strength. Therefore, the combined effect of dislocation density and the rapid thermal cycle was investigated by deforming the martensitic sheets to different levels of plastic deformation and subsequently <b>tempering</b> using conventional <b>furnace</b> <b>tempering</b> and the laser beam welding. It was found that the increased dislocation density due to the plastic deformation caused more nucleation sites for cementite precipitation, short-range carbon diffusion, and shorter growth period of cementite. The morphologies of the cementite were changed from elongated to small quasi-spherical when the sheet was plastically deformed. The deformed and tempered martensite yielded higher microhardness resulting from finer and semicoherent precipitates, a high density of retained dislocation density, and the presence of untempered and partially tempered martensite blocks. The thermal analysis of martensite tempering carried out using a dilatometer suggests that the carbide precipitation temperature range increases to the higher tempering temperature when the sheet was subjected to rapid thermal cycles. Finally, a microstructural based model was applied to predict the yield strength and microhardness of the tempered martensite by incorporating the effects of heating rate, tempering temperature, and time. Experimental and modelling results suggest that the faster tempering mode in combination with a very short tempering duration provides the highest tempered martensite strength...|$|R
