5|$|Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) warns the FBI and BATF that Ephesian and {{his wives}} will be {{released}} in a day unless they can track down Sidney and the Temple's reported weapons cache. The agents question Ephesian, who states {{that there is no}} member of the temple named Sidney. When they interview Melissa, she suddenly begins <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>like</b> Sidney, claiming that Harry Truman is president. Scully believes Melissa is exhibiting multiple personality disorder, but Mulder thinks she is recalling a past life. The agents take her back to the temple, where she takes on the personality of a woman from the Civil War period and says that the weapons were hidden in another secret bunker in the field. She also states that Mulder, in a past life, was a Confederate soldier in the field with her, her beloved, and she watched him die.|$|E
500|$|... "Acrobat" [...] {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{personal}} songs on Achtung Baby with Bono acknowledging personal weakness, contradictions, and inadequacy. The Edge noted that the song contained [...] "a bit of venom", likening it to [...] "the bitter, John Lennon tradition of 'Working Class Hero', slightly snarling and cynical." [...] Bono stated [...] "as we moved from the eighties to the nineties, I stopped throwing rocks at the obvious symbols of power and the abuse of it. I started throwing rocks at my own hypocrisy... 'Acrobat' [...] 'Don't believe what you hear, don't believe what you see / If you just close your eyes / You can feel the enemy...' I can't remember it, but the point is: you start to see the world in a different way, and you're part of the problem, not just part of the solution". In 2006, he noted it was [...] "a song about being a hypocrite, and I think we all can be and I certainly have been. And you know, you exact very high standards on people in the world but then you don't live them personally", noting the theme was most evident in the lyric [...] "I must be an acrobat <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>like</b> this and act like that". Hot Press editor Niall Stokes felt The Edge's guitar playing combined elements of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] with [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky". Speaking of its theme he said [...] "at its heart is an awareness of the ravages of time, and what it does to people and to relationships. But beyond that, there is the self-awareness that, itself, comes only with experience... Bono acknowledges his own weakness and inadequacy. He is more conscious now than ever before of the contradictions in his own position." [...] Andy Greene of Rolling Stone believed the [...] "aggressive and venomous" [...] song reflected Bono's thoughts during the album sessions, saying [...] "Nearly every lyric brims with rage... It was a new decade and it was quite possible they were about to be dismissed as a relic of the past." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of their father's death, their mother would slip into a deep depression and {{spend a lot of}} time in bed. In an effort to cheer her up, Ullman, along with her sister, created and performed a nightly variety show on the windowsill in their mother's bedroom. “It was originally the Patti Ullman Show. So I’m a spin-off of my sister’s show, as she likes to point out.” In the show, Ullman would mimic neighbours, teachers, family members, and celebrities such as Julie Andrews and Édith Piaf. [...] "Some kids can play the piano or kick a football; I could just impersonate everyone." [...] She would also perform alone for herself after everyone had gone to bed. [...] "I'd stand in front of the mirror and talk to myself until I fell asleep. I'd interview myself as women with problems. Women in documentaries who had three kids and chain-smoked and husbands in prison that hit them." [...] Her mother would eventually remarry to a man who Ullman has described as a maniac who drove a London taxi and had a son who stole. [...] "We weren't the Brady Bunch, let me tell you!" [...] The marriage brought an end to the children's late night antics. [...] "There was a new person in her bed now and I couldn't do my nightly performance anymore. I was nine years old and my show had been cancelled." [...] Alcoholism and domestic violence became a common occurrence in the household. The marriage also resulted in the family moving around the country, with Ullman attending numerous state schools. Her flair for mimicry helped with the transitions as her new classmates didn't take to her upper crust accent. [...] "I had <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>like</b> them to avoid being beaten up." ...|$|E

2500|$|... “The [...] was mysterious for the Indians." [...] It {{was good}} when the Indians {{did not know}} the ways of the white man. It made the Indians like one family. Bad Indians could not become Hunka. It was not the white man’s way of teaching. Sometimes many Indians camped {{together}} to perform the ceremony. Then there were good times. This was usually in the summer time. The winter was not a good time for the ceremony, because food was not plenty during the winter. When many Indians gathered together for the ceremony, the old men counseled and the young men played games. The women provided plenty to eat. The children were happy and were never hungry. The young people made lover. Many sought a vision, and talked with the spirits. The good spirits attended such gatherings. The bad spirits also come. The Lakotas here practiced this ceremony for many years. It was not always the same. The shamans first learned how to perform it right. These shamans became Oglalas. The other Lakota learned how to perform it from the Oglalas. Other Indians are Hunkas, but they are not full Hunkas like the Oglalas. The young people do not become Hunka now. It is of no use to them. The old people do not pay attention to the Hunka now. The Hunka are not what they were in old times. Some old Indians could perform the ceremony right. An old Indian who wears the gee string and leggings could perform it. He might be afraid <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>like</b> the Indians did before they lived on a reservation. It would not be right to teach the young Indians what was taught to the Hunka in old times. There are some secret things taught to a Hunka. These secrets are not good now. They are not about the spirits. The spirits will not come now. These are the spirits of the skies of the Earth, of the clouds, of the Thunder, of the land of pines, of the coming light of the sunset of the south, of the winds, of the waters, of flying things, of the beasts, of the insects, and of the spider. There are bad spirits also. There are ghosts and the man from the land of the pines. One spirit is stronger than another. One spirit is chief, and can influence all other spirits. These spirits come no more to the Indians of the reservation. It involved things that would not be allowed now. The Oglala did not think these things were wrong, but the white people do. For example a Hunka was taught how to steal horses and steal women from other Indians than Lakota.” “White men have their Bible and their Christ to guide them to the life to come. We Indians have our White Cow traditions and brave deeds. Let us wait, my friend, and see who gets there first.” ...|$|E
