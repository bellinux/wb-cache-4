40|$|The {{fracture}} {{behavior of}} polycarbonate was studied {{as a function}} of temperature (- 80 °C to + 80 °C) and <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> (10 - 5 to 10 m/s) using an instrumented, singleedged, notched tensile test (SENT). SENT tests give information on the fracture stress, fracture displacements, and fracture energies of polycarbonate, and from these data the average crack speeds were calculated and the brittle-ductile transitions were determined. The fracture stress and the fracture energies of ductile fracturing samples increased with increasing <b>test</b> <b>speed.</b> The fracture surfaces were studied by scanning electron analysis, and sometimes a mixed mode fracture, part ductile and part brittle, could be seen. At high <b>test</b> <b>speeds,</b> a sharp brittle-ductile transition was observed, while at low <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> the transition was more gradual, via a mixed mode region. This mixed mode region decreased in size with increasing <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> and was absent at the higher <b>test</b> <b>speeds.</b> The average crack speeds in the ductile region were directly related to the <b>test</b> <b>speeds.</b> The brittle-ductile transition temperature increased with the logarithmic of the <b>test</b> <b>speed...</b>|$|R

On these materials the yield strength and the notched tensile behaviour was studied as function of <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> (10 − 4 – 10 m/s). With an infrared temperature camera the heat development in the notched samples is studied as function of <b>test</b> <b>speed.</b> On fractured materials {{the structure of the}} deformation zone is studied {{in the middle of the}} sample, perpendicular to the fracture plane. The yield strength increases with the strain rate and at high rates this increase is stronger. The fracture energy shows a complex relationship with <b>test</b> <b>speed.</b> At low <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> the fracture energy decreases rapidly with <b>test</b> <b>speed.</b> At intermediate <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> however the fracture energy increases with increasing <b>test</b> <b>speed.</b> On the micrographs of the high speed deformed samples the formation of a melt zone was observed.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the rubber {{particle}} size and rubber content on the fracture behaviour of polypropylene–EPR blends was studied at low and high <b>test</b> <b>speeds.</b> The particle size was varied by changing the molecular weight of the EPR phase, and ranged from about 0. 5 to around 4. 0 μm. The fracture behaviour was determined {{as a function of}} temperature by the notched Izod impact <b>test</b> (high <b>test</b> <b>speed)</b> and by a tensile test on notched Izod bars at 1 mm/s (low <b>test</b> <b>speed).</b> At high <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> the brittle–ductile transition temperature (Tbd) increases with increasing particle size. At low <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> the Tbd decreases slightly with increasing particle size. The weight average particle size gave a better correlation with the notched Izod results than the number average particle size.

40|$|Acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene was blended in {{polycarbonate}} using a twin-screw extruder, producing dispersed and co-continuous blends. The blends were {{injection moulded}} into test bars. These materials {{were tested in}} single edge notch tensile tests {{as a function of}} <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> over a <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> range of 10 − 4 – 10 m s− 1 (2. 85 × 10 − 3 – 2. 85 × 102 s− 1). Infrared measurements were made to monitor the temperature development in the material during fracture. The fracture energies were higher at high <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> than could be expected based on the low speeds results. This effect was due to an increased fracture stress, initiation strain, and propagation strain. With infrared measurements a temperature increase of 30 – 40 °C was observed. Also the size of the deformation zone increased with <b>test</b> <b>speed.</b> A possible explanation is a thermal blunting resulting from adiabatic heating at high speeds. The brittle–ductile transition temperature increased linearly with the logarithm of the strain rate by a factor of 18. 6.

40|$|Solder joint {{reliability}} {{concerns are}} increasing exponentially with the continuous push for device miniaturization, and the expanded use in portable electronic products. In order {{to predict the}} solder joint reliability under drop conditions, {{it is important to}} increase the <b>testing</b> <b>speed</b> of package level test methods, such as high-speed solder ball shear and pull. Traditional ball shear and pull tests are not considered suitable for evaluation of joint reliability under drop loading, since the applied <b>test</b> <b>speeds,</b> usually lower than 5 mm/s, are well below the impact velocity applied to the solder joint in a drop test. Recently, high-speed shear and pull test equipment (Dage 4000 HS) with <b>testing</b> <b>speeds</b> beyond 1, 000 mm/s has become available. The present study continues the efforts reported recently and investigates the effect of thermal aging on the attachment strength and fracture energy of SnAgCu lead-free solder balls during high <b>speed</b> ball shear/pull <b>tests.</b> The ball shear <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> ranged from 100 mm/s to 1, 000 mm/s, while the ball pull <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> ranged from 5 mm/s to 100 mm/s.

40|$|ABSTRACTThis paper {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} different <b>test</b> <b>speeds</b> and specimen sizes, free of defects, in determiningthe bending strength of three Brazilian woods. Its importance lies {{in the possibility of}} establishing methodsof characterization with smaller specimens and higher speeds, resulting in time saving and cost reduction intransport, without loss of quality and precision in results. Traditionally, tests with small variations of speedand specimen size have been little discussed, possibly {{due to the lack of}} interest in changing methodologieswhich are already established. The methodology used here involved the static bending with moisturecontent at 12 %, five specimen sizes and three <b>test</b> <b>speeds.</b> The species characterized were: cumaru (Dipterixodorata), jequitibá (Allantoma lineata) and quaruba (Vochyisia guianensis). References on dimensions andspeeds were selected based on theComisión Panamericana de Normas Técnicas(COPANT 555 / 73). Thesestandards establish procedures for determining the physical and mechanical properties of wood species, free of defects, using small specimen sizes.
