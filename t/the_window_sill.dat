25|$|The {{cherries}} {{present on}} the tree outside the window may symbolize love. The oranges which lie on <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sill</b> and chest may symbolize the purity and innocence that reigned in the Garden of Eden before the Fall of Man. They were uncommon and a sign of wealth in the Netherlands, but in Italy were a symbol of fecundity in marriage. The fruit could more simply {{be a sign of}} the couple's wealth since oranges were very expensive imports. It could be a sign of fertility as well.|$|E
25|$|Transoms â€“ These timbers extend {{across the}} low {{parts of the}} hull near the rudder, and are secured (notched and/or bolted) to the sternpost. The transom located {{at the base of}} the stern, and the {{uppermost}} of the main transoms, was typically called the wing transom; the principal transom below this and level with the lower deck was called the deck transom; between these two were a series of filling transoms. If the stern had transoms above the wing transom, they would no longer be affixed to the sternpost. The first of these might be called a counter transom; next up was <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sill</b> transom; above that, the spar deck transom. The larger the vessel, the more numerous and wider the transoms required to support its stern.|$|E
25|$|At the Battle of Germantown on 4 October 1777, the American {{offensive}} stalled when Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Musgrave and 120 British {{soldiers of}} the 40th Foot stoutly defended the Chew House. After artillery and infantry assaults failed, du Plessis and other officers attempted to set the house on fire. To fellow aide John Laurens, du Plessis suggested the idea of fetching hay from the nearby barn and using it to ignite the structure. Using the kitchen outbuilding as cover, du Plessis reached a ground-floor window {{to the left of}} the servant's entrance. He smashed it and tried to climb in. Perched on <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sill,</b> he found himself face to face with a pistol-wielding British officer who demanded his surrender. At that moment, a British soldier burst into the room and fired at du Plessis but hit the officer by mistake. After this close call, the Frenchman decided to retreat. With numerous American soldiers looking on, he refused to run for it. He later claimed that he retired at a walk, which he managed to do without being shot, though Laurens was slightly wounded in the shoulder. Two of Major General John Sullivan's aides, Captains John White and Edward Sherburne were killed while unsuccessfully trying to carry out this dangerous mission.|$|E
50|$|Both {{floors of}} the 1905 {{building}} were subdivided into four classrooms, off a central hallway. Plastered walls had beadboard wainscotting {{at the height of}} <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sills.</b> Ceilings were also beadboard.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} elevation, originally verandahed, is now {{largely the}} later {{section of the}} building, with roughly tooled and margined sandstone to the underside of <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sills</b> and vertical timber boarding above.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>window</b> <b>sills</b> and {{decorative}} <b>window</b> lintels in <b>the</b> facades are both of stone, with the lintel having bevels etched into them to mimic voussoirs and keystones. A trench, {{surrounded by a}} black wrought iron fence and not visible from the street, permits light to enter <b>the</b> basement <b>windows.</b> <b>The</b> basement <b>window</b> <b>sills</b> are wood and the lintels brick. The first and second story windows are 9/9, while the smaller third story <b>windows</b> are 6/3. <b>The</b> basement <b>windows</b> are all 6/6.|$|R
25|$|The {{first floor}} {{exterior}} wall consists of limestone quoins {{at the corner}} and stone coursing. A string course with Greek decorative carving is set {{between the first and}} second floors, and acts as <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sill</b> for the second floor windows and as the balustrade for the entrance loggia. The second and third floor exterior walls have stone quoins as well. Between each window on the second floor is a panel inlaid with variegated marble and surrounded by egg-and-dart moldings. The base of the panel is decorated with scrollwork, and the top by a bas-relief urn. Five fruit-shaped clusters decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on this floor (the lowest cluster supported by a tiny putto), while above each window is a false pediment topped by an escutcheon flanked by drapery. Variegated marble panels are set between each window on the third floor as well, the bottom of each decorated with scrollwork and a small dramatic mask. The sill of each third floor window is of scrollwork, while the window is topped by scrollwork and a torch. Circular medallions with pendants decorate the outside frame of the furthermost window on the third floor. A bas-relief putto stands atop each medallion and panel, supporting fruit swags. Between the third and fourth (or attic) floors is a molding decorated with repetitive small eggs which serves as the sill for the fourth floor windows. The truncated hipped roof slightly overhangs the walls. The cornice is decorated with dentils and acanthus carvings beneath the roofline. The roof, originally red tile, was changed at some point to asbestos roof shingles with copper flashing. There are seven chimneys on the roof, and about five skylights on the flat section.|$|E
500|$|The windows mainly {{date from}} the 19th century. [...] The south wall of the nave has a blocked-up round-headed window from the 12th century. The 19th-century east window has three lights (sections of window {{separated}} vertically by mullions) topped by tracery in trefoil shapes (decorative stonework in a three-leaf circular pattern). The chapel's north and west window are similar. The north window in the vestry has details {{similar to those of}} the blocked nave window, and reuses some medieval material in <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sill.</b> There is no stained glass in the church; all the windows have clear glass.|$|E

50|$|The {{church is}} a one story frame {{structure}} with vertical tongue and groove siding below <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sills</b> and horizontal clapboard siding above. The roof sections are gabled, all windows have pointed arches.|$|R
5000|$|Cast iron tie-backs {{became much}} more popular during the Federal period - usually mounted on arms {{extending}} from <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sills.</b> <b>The</b> [...] "Federal Shell" [...] was the dominant pattern in this period.|$|R
60|$|My upstretched fingers {{never reached}} <b>the</b> <b>window's</b> <b>sill.</b> At <b>the</b> first {{sound of the}} voices I drew back my hand and clung there to my perilous perch, {{flattened}} against the perpendicular wall, scarce daring to breathe.|$|R
500|$|Other, less obvious, {{elements}} of the painting reveal more about the poet's personality and ideas. The poem he is attempting to write is entitled [...] "Upon Riches", {{which suggests that the}} poet lives in a fantasy world, while his wife and child go hungry. Ned Ward's first published poem in 1691 was The Poet's Ramble After Riches, which satirised his own struggles as an impoverished aspiring poet, and Hogarth may have had this in mind when he produced the picture. Earlier impressions showed the poem as [...] "Poverty, A Poem", which hinted at a connection to Theobald who had written [...] "The Cave of Poverty, A Poem, Written in Imitation of Shakespeare" [...] in 1714. The poet's dreams of riches are further suggested by the map that hangs over his head, entitled [...] "A View of the Gold Mines of Peru", replacing the image of Pope that appears in the earlier states of the print. The poet's self-interest is hinted by the presence of his pipe and tobacco on <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sill,</b> the mug of beer sitting on the chair {{in the back of the}} room, the lace cuffs drying by the fire, his ill-fitting wig, and gentleman's sword lying at his feet; it may be that despite his family's circumstances, he refuses to forgo his own personal pleasures and effects. Alternatively, his fantasy of earning a fortune from his art may require that he keeps his gentlemanly accoutrements around him, as they will be required when his fantasies are realized.|$|E
2500|$|The {{literary}} critic Anthony Julius, who has analysed {{the presence of}} anti-Semitic rhetoric in Eliot's work, has cited [...] "Gerontion" [...] {{as an example of}} a poem by Eliot that contains anti-Semitic sentiments. In the voice of the poem's elderly narrator, the poem contains the line, [...] "And the Jew squats on <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sill,</b> the owner [...] / Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{depiction}} of Jews {{in some of}} Eliot's poems has led several critics to accuse him of anti-Semitism. This case has been presented most forcefully {{in a study by}} Anthony Julius: T. S. Eliot, Anti-Semitism, and Literary Form (1996). In [...] "Gerontion", Eliot writes, in the voice of the poem's elderly narrator, [...] "And the jew squats on <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sill,</b> the owner [...] / Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp." [...] Another well-known example appears in the poem, [...] "Burbank with a Baedeker: Bleistein with a Cigar". In this poem, Eliot wrote, [...] "The rats are underneath the piles. / The jew is underneath the lot. / Money in furs." [...] Interpreting the line as an indirect comparison of Jews to rats, Julius writes, [...] "The anti-Semitism is unmistakable. It reaches out like a clear signal to the reader." [...] Julius's viewpoint has been supported by literary critics such as Harold Bloom, Christopher Ricks, George Steiner, Tom Paulin and James Fenton.|$|E
50|$|Tally, Mastin and Summer used {{contemporary}} and mid-century modern design features to ensure both the affordable pricing {{and the high}} quality that appealed to DeKalb Countyâ€™s burgeoning middle class. Mastin and Summer drew significant inspiration from contemporary designs in California, and they found ways to incorporate many contemporary design features into the districtâ€™s modest homes. One notable and unique architectural feature in the district {{is the use of}} brick from the foundation up to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sills</b> of many homes with other materials from <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sills</b> to <b>the</b> roofline. This feature was designed to balance buyersâ€™ desire for brick with the goal of affordability.|$|R
25|$|Random rubble {{stonework}} {{is largely}} exposed {{on the interior}} of the church, as are the blockwork quoins. The porch, nave and apse have unpainted timber ceilings. There are panels of painted timber under <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sills</b> in <b>the</b> apse.|$|R
50|$|The Festhalle {{recently}} was being extensively renovated. In the bars on <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sills,</b> <b>windows</b> and ventilation shafts were re-fitted with the originally existing gold leaf. Cupolas on the towers {{that had not}} been reconstructed after the war have been rebuilt. The paint was changed from white to the pristine bright ocher.|$|R
6000|$|... "I-- I can't!" [...] gasped Miss Harrow. And now {{the youth}} {{saw that she}} was almost paralyzed from fright. She clung desperately to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sill,</b> evidently unable to move. Clinging to the ladder with his left hand, Tom placed his right foot on <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sill,</b> and then he reached down and caught the teacher under the arm.|$|E

50|$|The {{ornamentation}} of openings {{and wall}} surfaces is also modest but fine: <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> have slightly projecting corbelled triangular heads; the end gables have brick pointed arch courses above the grouped windows; <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>sills,</b> buttress copings and plinth are picked out in cement render, and diagonal brick end courses decorate the sills, cornice and plinth.|$|R
50|$|In 1985, {{the firm}} {{received}} international acclaim for building the energy-efficient Liberty Elementary School in Boise introduced energy-saving {{concepts such as}} solar energy and controllable electronics that took advantage of daylighting. The revolutionary design also entailed berming the earth up to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sills</b> to conserve energy needed for heating and cooling the building.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is an imposing two storey red brick structure with red corrugated iron roof. Rendered bands extend {{around the building}} and along <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sills.</b> There are gabled wings to each end, with half timbering creating a symmetrical faÃ§ade. There is a two storey panelled side extension joining the building to the current St John the Baptist Church.|$|R

5000|$|In the Trewern Chapel in {{the south}} transept, two inscribed stones are set into <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sills.</b> <b>The</b> Maglocunus Stone is inscribed in Latin [...] "MAGLOCUNI FILI CLUTORI" [...] and in Ogham [...] "maglicunas maqi clutar.." [...] and is of the 5th century or early 6th century. The Braided Cross is of the early 10th century.|$|R
60|$|The first floor, now closed, {{seemed to}} house {{millinery}} or furs. The second floor, by the winking electric letters, was the dentist's. Above this a polyglot babel of signs struggled {{to indicate the}} abodes of palmists, dressmakers, musicians and doctors. Still higher up draped curtains and milk bottles white on <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sills</b> proclaimed <b>the</b> regions of domesticity.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{continuous}} pressed metal cornice around {{the east and}} south roof lines. The cornice contains brackets, dentils, and a decorated frieze. There are belt courses of cast ornamental concrete over raised brick occurring at four levels: {{on the first floor}} under <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sills</b> a wide band above the first floor windows; on the second floor as {{a continuous}} band <b>window</b> <b>sill</b> and just below the metal frieze of the cornice. This cast concrete is used throughout the exterior to imitate stone.|$|R

They are 9 ft wide at <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sills</b> but only 8 ft wide {{at the door}} sills. Currently, most railcars {{operating}} on the Chicago [...] "L" [...] are DC power only; the 5000-series features AC motors, but the traction power supply continues to use DC.|$|R
5000|$|The Michigan Central Railroad depot is {{a single}} story Richardsonian Romanesque {{structure}} constructed from fieldstone on a fieldstone foundation. [...] Stone slabs are used for <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sills</b> and lintels. <b>The</b> steep roof has a gable {{at one end and}} a hip roof at the other.

2500|$|Midland Works emitted vast {{quantities}} of asbestos dust, primarily through its ventilation system, which covered the nearby streets and rooftops of surrounding houses. One resident told of how his wife [...] "used to wipe the greyish white dust off <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>sills</b> of their home at 9.30 am, and that an hour later, if the machines at Roberts were blowing out dust, there would be another layer of dust half an inch thick." ...|$|R
