5|$|Dark beers {{are usually}} brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base {{with a small}} {{proportion}} of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade. Other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used <b>to</b> <b>darken</b> beers. Very dark beers, such as stout, use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer. Some have roasted unmalted barley.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles have a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings, {{and less}} {{white in the}} tail feathers. They can also be {{distinguished}} by their constant begging calls. It {{is not possible to}} tell the sexes apart until the male's bill begins <b>to</b> <b>darken.</b> This begins when the male is around one year old, and is complete some time after two years of age.|$|E
5|$|The {{lighting}} system is programmed <b>to</b> <b>darken</b> the set as the contestant progresses {{further into the}} game. There are also spotlights situated {{at the bottom of}} the set area that zoom down on the contestant when they answer a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil is vaporized, creating a haze effect. Media scholar Dr. Robert Thompson, a professor at Syracuse University, stated that the show's {{lighting system}} made the contestant feel as though they were outside of prison when an escape was in progress.|$|E

The cultivar has a mean yield of 2831 kg ha- 1, high grain quality with tolerance <b>to</b> <b>darkening,</b> and resistance <b>to</b> Fusarium oxysporum and physiological races 81, 89, and 95 of the anthracnose pathogen (Colletotrichum lindemuthianum) ...|$|R
5|$|The {{photostability}} of pigments can {{be enhanced}} {{by the addition of}} cerium. It provides pigments with light fastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight. Television glass plates are subject to electron bombardment, which tends <b>to</b> <b>darken</b> them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of cerium oxide. Cerium is also an essential component of phosphors used in TV screens and fluorescent lamps. Cerium sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable up to 350°C. The pigment is a nontoxic alternative to cadmium sulfide pigments.|$|E
5|$|The game {{needed a}} 32 megabit battery backed-up {{cartridge}} to work properly, and was expensive to produce. This factor deterred some publishers, alongside {{the fact that}} launching a new intellectual property was considered risky. WayForward {{tried to find a}} publisher for years, before Capcom eventually picked the game for release. Capcom, however, held back the release for months, during which the Game Boy Advance was released. It is rumored that the game had only one run of 20–25,000 copies. WayForward saw that the console's screen had a tendency <b>to</b> <b>darken</b> the colours, so they took back the game and made further developments on it, incorporating a feature to brighten the screen if played on a Game Boy Advance, alongside some bonus features.|$|E
5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends <b>to</b> <b>darken</b> due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E

25|$|Aliphatic and cycloaliphatic {{isocyanates}} {{are used}} in smaller quantities, most often in coatings and other applications where color and transparency are important since polyurethanes made with aromatic isocyanates tend <b>to</b> <b>darken</b> on exposure to light. The most important aliphatic and cycloaliphatic isocyanates are 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI), 1-isocyanato-3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethyl-cyclohexane (isophorone diisocyanate, IPDI), and 4,4′-diisocyanato dicyclohexylmethane, (H12MDI or hydrogenated MDI).|$|E

These and other issues are reviewed, along with actions that can be taken to control them and minimize problems with end users...|$|R
50|$|One purported {{method of}} {{naturally}} whitening the teeth {{is through the}} use of malic acid. The juice of apples, especially green apples, contains malic acid. On the other hand excessive consumption of acidic beverages will slowly dissolve the enamel layer, making the underlying yellower dentin show through more noticeably, leading <b>to</b> <b>darkening</b> of the tooth's appearance. One study indicates that malic acid is a weak tooth whitening agent.|$|R

25|$|There is {{no known}} cure for vitiligo. For those with light skin, {{sunscreen}} and makeup {{are all that}} is typically recommended. Other treatment options may include steroid creams or phototherapy <b>to</b> <b>darken</b> the light patches. Alternatively, efforts to lighten the unaffected skin, such as with hydroquinone, may be tried. A number of surgical options are available {{for those who do}} not improve with other measures. A combination of treatments generally has better outcomes. Counselling to provide emotional support may be useful.|$|E

The fruit is a red or brownish, fingerlike capsule 1 to 2 centimeters long.|$|R
25|$|Polarization is {{observed}} {{in the light of}} the sky, as this is due to sunlight scattered by aerosols as it passes through the earth's atmosphere. The scattered light produces the brightness and color in clear skies. This partial polarization of scattered light can be used <b>to</b> <b>darken</b> the sky in photographs, increasing the contrast. This effect is most strongly observed at points on the sky making a 90° angle to the sun. Polarizing filters use these effects to optimize the results of photographing scenes in which reflection or scattering by the sky is involved.|$|E
25|$|Painting {{the human}} body in black is also {{employed}} in low-key photography using non-toxic dyes or pigments in order <b>to</b> <b>darken</b> and enhance {{as much as possible}} the colour of the subjects photographed, and to achieve the desired effects. In order to achieve the effect of reflection of light that creates a white contour of the painted body, as well as a high contrast between black and white, various dyes mixed with body creams are used. These usually include henna, tempera or acrylic paint. Liquid latex, which is composed of natural latex and dyes, is also used.|$|E
25|$|Linear {{polarizing}} filters {{were the}} first types {{to be used in}} photography and can still be used for non-reflex and older SLR cameras. However, cameras with through-the-lens metering and autofocusing systems – that is, all modern SLR and DSLR – rely on optical elements that pass linearly polarized light. If light entering the camera is already linearly polarized, it can upset the exposure or autofocus systems. Circular polarizing filters cut out linearly polarized light and so can be used <b>to</b> <b>darken</b> skies or remove reflections, but the circular polarized light it passes does not impair through-the-lens systems.|$|E

25|$|Increased {{distress}} to tissue causes capillaries {{to break}} under the skin, allowing blood to escape and build up. As time progresses, blood seeps {{into the surrounding}} tissues, causing the bruise <b>to</b> <b>darken</b> and spread. Nerve endings within the affected tissue detect the increased pressure, which, depending on severity and location, {{may be perceived as}} pain or pressure or be asymptomatic. The damaged capillary endothelium releases endothelin, a hormone that causes narrowing of the blood vessel to minimize bleeding. As the endothelium is destroyed, the underlying von Willebrand factor is exposed and initiates coagulation, which creates a temporary clot to plug the wound and eventually leads to restoration of normal tissue.|$|E
25|$|Light {{reflected}} by shiny transparent materials is {{partly or fully}} polarised, except when the light is normal (perpendicular) to the surface. It was this effect that allowed the mathematician Étienne-Louis Malus to make the measurements that allowed for his development of the first mathematical models for polarised light. Polarization occurs when light is scattered in the atmosphere. The scattered light produces the brightness and colour in clear skies. This partial polarization of scattered light can be taken advantage of using polarizing filters <b>to</b> <b>darken</b> the sky in photographs. Optical polarization is principally of importance in chemistry due to circular dichroism and optical rotation ("circular birefringence") exhibited by optically active (chiral) molecules.|$|E
25|$|In the {{winemaking}} process, acids aid {{in enhancing}} {{the effectiveness of}} sulfur dioxide to protect the wines from spoilage and can also protect the wine from bacteria due to the inability of most bacteria to survive in low pH solutions. Two notable exceptions to this are Acetobacter and the lactic acid bacteria. In red wines, acidity helps preserve and stabilize {{the color of the}} wine. The ionization of anthocyanins is affected by pH, so wines with lower pH (such as Sangiovese-based wines) have redder, more stable colors. Wines with higher pH (such as Syrah-based wines) have higher levels of less stable blue pigments, eventually taking on a muddy grey hue. These wines can also develop a brownish tinge. In white wines, higher pH (lower acidity) causes the phenolics in the wine <b>to</b> <b>darken</b> and eventually polymerize as brown deposits.|$|E
40|$|The {{conductivity}} of poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) –poly(styrenesulfonic) acid (PEDOT–PSS) thin-films {{was increased}} {{by up to}} 900 times {{with the addition of}} linear-diols. Three series of linear-diols were investigated. It is proposed that three mechanisms contribute to improved conductivity; conformational changes in the polymer from coil to expanded, spatial separation of PEDOT–PSS grains and charge screening. The variation in conductivity with temperature indicates that diols affect both intra- and inter-chain charge transports. Electrochromic devices were constructed using standard and enhanced conductivity PEDOT–PSS. Switching times from bleached <b>to</b> <b>darkened</b> states were reduced while <b>darkened</b> <b>to</b> bleached states remained unaltered. Total percent transmission change (%ΔTx) remained constant indicating that enhanced conductivity PEDOT–PSS improves switching but does not lead to additional electrochromic redox sites being accessed...|$|R
