We report a cluster-based deposition technology that provides efficient <b>trench</b> <b>filling</b> and excellent selectivity between trenches and plateaus on damascene structures. The selectivity arises {{due to the}} propen-sity for reflection of clusters from the planar surfaces between trenches. Trenches of sub- 200 nm widths, with various diffusion barriers and seed layers, and up to 5 : 1 aspect ratios have been completely filled with copper clusters. We also show that copper clusters can be sintered into a seed layer using hydrogen an-nealing. Thus, dense copper films within trenches are obtained.

RF-GD-OES (radio frequency glow discharge optical emission spectrometry) was used for detection of C and H as indicators for incorporated hydrocarbon molecules. The presented results indicate a fragmentation of incorporated hydrocarbons and their constrict segregation near the Cu surface. The bilateral relationship between incorporated organic impurities and intrinsic stress behavior {{is associated with the}} Gorky effect. Key words: Electrochemical deposition; copper; impurities; segregation; GD-OES. The electrochemical deposition of Cu is widely applied for manufacturing of conducting lines and vias of semiconductor devices. This technique is very cost-effective by offering a high deposition rate, low temperature processing, system simplicity, and good process controllability. Particularly, Cu electroplating is favored for damascene process, which requires a good <b>trench</b> <b>filling</b> with high aspect ratio [1, 2].

30|$|During this {{technological}} evolution, one of {{a central}} issue has been to improve transistor performance by using different strain engineering methods to enhance channel mobility [4]. SiGe alloys {{have been used in}} source/drain regions already in 90 nm node by Intel in 2003. In such transistors, selective epitaxial growth (SEG) was used to fill the source/drain-recessed regions to create uniaxial strain in the channel region. To further enhance the channel mobility, the Ge content in SiGe (or strain) has been continuously increased from lower to remarkably higher by every node [2, 5 – 7]. The main issue with selective epitaxy growth is that the SiGe film strain is dependent on variation of growth parameters. These parameters were optimized for growth of highly strained SiGe film and integration in pMOS source/drain areas of 22 nm node. In such transistors, the strain in the channel region is generated from SiGe which uniaxially exerts from source/drain. Another important issue to enhance the channel control and improve performance is introducing the high dielectric material (high-k) and metal gate (MG) into the traditional MOSFET [8, 9]. One of the main issue for process integration of high-k and metal gate is conformal film filling in the gate with the small trench. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is a technology based on sequential self-saturated surface treatment and reactions, which lead to the controlled cycle-by-cycle period growth of very thin films. ALD technology is applied to deposit the high-k materials and metal gate due to its excellent <b>trench</b> <b>filling</b> and process flexibility, which is widely applied in the gate-last process integration scheme [10 – 12].|$|E
