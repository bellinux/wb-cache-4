500|$|Davies {{stated that}} he {{originally}} intended to call this episode [...] "Dining with Monsters". He joked that a much better name for this episode would be [...] "What should we do with Margaret?" [...] Davies intended the episode to be a character piece exploring whether the Doctor {{had the authority to}} <b>take</b> <b>someone</b> to their death sentence, as well as showing the consequences of the Doctor's actions the last time he met Margaret. The storyline was fitting for Eccleston's war-torn Doctor. The consequences of the Doctor's lifestyle is also explored through Rose's boyfriend Mickey, who has been forced to move on because she is not around. The resolution is a deliberate deus ex machina, regressing Margaret so she can start anew, although Davies remarked that the resolution did not come completely out of nowhere as the TARDIS' psychic link had been already established.|$|E

500|$|The song's lyrics {{delve into}} Lo's hedonistic {{attempts}} to forget her former boyfriend. According to Markos Papadatos of Digital Journal, the narrator describes her attempts {{to overcome a}} failed relationship through binge eating and alcohol, as indicated in the lyrics about having the munchies, eating Twinkies, and throwing up during the first verse. In the chorus, she sings about drug abuse: [...] "You're gone and I gotta stay high / All the time, to keep you off my mind". According to Adam R. Holz of Plugged In, in the bridge, Lo approaches the theme of [...] "knowing—at some level—just how empty and self-obliterating her choices really are", as she talks about needing to <b>take</b> <b>someone</b> home in order to relieve her suffering. The singer confessed to iHeart Radio that the song's bridge is her {{favorite part of the}} track because [...] "that just says everything [...] song is about for me". However, Billboard Jeremy D. Larson considered the song's message untrue because [...] "staying high does not keep anyone off your mind".|$|E
500|$|In Buddhist {{texts and}} practice, giving is {{considered}} the easiest of the three bases of merit. It helps to overcome selfishness and stills the mind; it prepares the mind {{for the practice of}} virtue. It is also considered a form of saving, considering there is a rebirth in which people receive back what they have given. As for virtue, this comprises three out of eight aspects of the eight-fold path, the path central in the Buddhist teaching: right speech, right action and right livelihood. Being the main criterion for moral behavior in Buddhism, virtue is mostly about the undertaking of five precepts, although the eight precepts may be kept now and then. The five precepts are part of many Buddhist ceremonies, and are also considered a merit itself, helping the practitioner to become strong and healthy. The benefits of practicing the three bases of merits are also summarized as three forms of happiness (...) —happiness as a human being, happiness in heaven, and happiness in Nirvana. When people die, what world they will be reborn into depends on how intense they practice these three bases of merit. It is, however, only mental development that can <b>take</b> <b>someone</b> to the highest heavenly worlds, or to Nirvana.|$|E
500|$|In the film, Carey's {{character}} Billie Frank argues {{with her}} boyfriend and producer Dice (Max Beesley) and they break-up. Her emotional pain leads her to solo songwriting. Dice also misses Billie, and also begins writing a song. Billie goes to Dice's apartment {{in an attempt to}} reconcile. He was not home, but the music he has written is and Billie realizes they wrote the same song: [...] "Never Too Far". She kisses the sheet music, leaving a lipstick imprint, which Dice later discovers. Dice plans a reconciliation, but is killed by Billie's former producer Timothy Walker (Terrence Howard) after Dice did not pay the US$100,000 from their agreement to release Billie from Walker's contract. At Billie's first show at Madison Square Garden, her management and support crew see a report of the murder on television. They wonder if Billie was with him, they see that she is there and has seen the report. Billie onstage commands the band to stop playing [...] "Loverboy", tells the crowd never to <b>take</b> <b>someone</b> for granted, and that if you love them, you should tell them, because you might never have the chance to tell them how you really feel. She then starts to sing [...] "Never Too Far".|$|E

2500|$|Adaptations which {{reset the}} story in a new setting include the 1953 {{adaptation}} retitled Abismos de Pasion directed by Spanish filmmaker Luis Buñuel set in Catholic Mexico, with Heathcliff and Cathy renamed Alejandro and Catalina. In Buñuel's version Heathcliff/Alejandro claims to have become rich by making a deal with Satan. The New York Times reviewed a re-release of this film as [...] "an almost magical example of how an artist of genius can <b>take</b> <b>someone</b> else's classic work and shape it to fit his own temperament without really violating it," [...] noting that the film was thoroughly Spanish and Catholic in its tone while still highly faithful to Brontë. Yoshishige Yoshida's 1988 adaptation also has a transposed setting, this time in medieval Japan. In Yoshida's version, the Heathcliff character, Onimaru, is raised in a nearby community of priests who worship a local fire god. In 2003, MTV produced a poorly reviewed version set in a modern California high school.|$|E
2500|$|In most {{editions of}} The Mole, however, players are usually {{given the chance}} at [...] "exemptions" [...] or [...] "free passes". Should a player earn an exemption, {{he or she is}} not {{required}} to take the quiz and thus safe from elimination. Traditionally, an exemption must be earned by preventing the team from winning their challenges (such as being successful in evading identification by the other contestants in a photo hunt). Seasons 2 and 5 of The Mole in the US saw the most prevalent use of exemptions, with nearly one every episode, and multiple exemptions on occasion. In the 2009 edition in the Netherlands, the [...] "super exemption" [...] was introduced. In the episode the contestants were able to find two regular exemptions. If, during the quiz, only one exemption was used, it counted as an exemption for the person who used it. He or she could <b>take</b> <b>someone</b> with him or her to stay another round. If, however, both exemptions were to be used none of the players would have to leave, hence the [...] "super exemption". In the fifth season of the Australian version, its host Tom Williams referred to them frequently as [...] "immunity" [...] rather than [...] "exemptions" [...] or [...] "free passes".|$|E
