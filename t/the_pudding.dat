5|$|After {{the release}} of Magnolia, Anderson stated {{that he would like}} to work with comedic actor Adam Sandler in the future and that he was {{determined}} to make his next film a comparatively shorter length of just 90 minutes. The resulting feature was the romantic comedy-drama film Punch-Drunk Love (2002), starring Sandler, with Emily Watson portraying his love interest. The story centers on a beleaguered small-business owner (Sandler) with anger issues and seven emasculating sisters. A subplot in the film was partly based on David Phillips (also called <b>The</b> <b>Pudding</b> Guy). Sandler received critical praise for his role in his first major departure from the mainstream comedies that had made him a star. At the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, Anderson won the Best Director Award and was nominated for the Palme d'Or.|$|E

5|$|The rivers {{were run}} {{down by the}} 1920s and, with high {{unemployment}} in the area, West Ham Corporation and the Lee Conservancy Board applied for a government unemployment relief grant, with which to fund major improvements. In addition {{to work on the}} channels, Bow Tidal Lock was duplicated, Marshgate Lock was rebuilt further east as City Mill Lock, and a second new lock at Carpenters Road was constructed. It used up-and-over radial gates operated by winches, rather than the traditional mitre gates used at City Mill Lock. The gates were quadrant-shaped, and were raised out of the river to allow boats to enter or leave the lock. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1930 to authorise the work, called the River Lee (Flood Relief) Act, and work began the following year. The project was completed in 1935. Before the work, there had been a floodgate on the Waterworks River above its junction with the Three Mills Wall River, and a large pool, the City Mill Pool, connecting to the City Mills River and Saint Thomas Creek. Marshgate Lock was situated {{to the west of the}} junction between <b>the</b> <b>Pudding</b> Mill River and Saint Thomas Creek. It was originally built in 1864, by adding a second set of gates to Hunters Gates, a floodgate which had been built around 1847. The reconstructed lock was built on the site of the City Mill Pool, and had two sets of gates at its eastern end, to prevent high tidal levels in Waterworks River flooding the waterways to the west. It was labelled Marshgate Lane Lock on the 1948 map, but was called Ward Lock, after a local councillor, and is now known as City Mills Lock. The course of the Saint Thomas Creek was then straightened, and the original Marshgate Lock was bypassed. Pudding Mill River became a dead end when the lower section was filled in, as was most of the Three Mills Back River, and the floodgate on Waterworks River was also removed. Reconstruction of the channels included widening City Mill River to , while Three Mills Wall River and Waterworks River were made twice that width.|$|E

25|$|The Ryton draws {{its water}} from the Anston Brook, <b>the</b> <b>Pudding</b> Dyke, the Bondhay Dyke, {{and to a lesser}} extent the Broadbridge Dyke. Prior to the {{construction}} of the Chesterfield Canal in the 1770s, the flow of the Broadbridge Dyke was much greater, but water from its catchment area was diverted to form the reservoirs at Pebley and Harthill, which supply the canal. Overflow from the reservoirs reaches the Ryton by <b>the</b> <b>Pudding</b> Dyke, but the river also supplies water to the canal via the Brancliffe feeder and the Kilton feeder. The natural water sources are supplemented by the outflows from Dinnington and Anston Sewage Treatment Works into the Anston Brook, which together provide about 7 Ml/d (megalitres per day), while Kilton Treatment Works supplies about 12.8 Ml/d. At Manton, excess flow from the canal tops up the river, and water pumped from Manton Colliery formerly performed the same function. With the closure of the mine, a new borehole was constructed in 2004, and water is pumped from the Sherwood Sandstone aquifer into the river. The borehole is operated by Severn Trent Water.|$|E

500|$|... "They Saved Lisa's Brain" [...] {{was written}} by Matt Selman and {{directed}} by Pete Michels. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 9, 1999. Although the episode's first draft {{was written by}} Selman, {{the idea for the}} episode was pitched by former staff writer George Meyer. In the episode's setpiece, Homer and Bart participate in a gross out contest, while Marge and Lisa are in the audience. According to Selman, the writers took inspiration from real gross out contests, which were [...] "sweeping the nation" [...] at the time. Before the contest in the episode, the spectators are given free samples of a pudding called Grandma Plopwell's. The name of <b>the</b> <b>pudding</b> was inspired by a brand of pies called Aunt Freshly, which the Simpsons writers usually ate at the time.|$|E
500|$|The Olympic Stadium for the London 2012 Summer Olympics is {{constructed}} on former industrial land between the Lea Navigation {{to the west}} and the City Mill River to the east. The land was formerly bisected by the remains of <b>the</b> <b>Pudding</b> Mill River, but this was filled in to provide a site which was large enough. As part of the construction phase for the event, Three Mills Lock was constructed on the Prescott Channel. This consists of a barge lock, suitable for [...] barges, and an adjacent sluice, which enables the water levels above the structure to be regulated, rather than navigation being subject to the tides. The lock was built to allow construction materials to be delivered to the site and spoil to be removed, and the final cost was £23 million, which included a sluice on the Three Mills Wall River. Work began in March 2007, and the project lasted for just over two years. Despite hopes that it would transport 1.75 million tonnes while the stadium was being built, very little commercial traffic used the new lock.|$|E
500|$|During its {{existence}} the Provisional Government's authority {{was restricted to}} the pioneer settlements, generally located in or around the Willamette Valley. [...] The entire Oregon Country was decreed to be covered by four administrative divisions. Initially created on 5 July 1843 were the Twality, Yamhill, Clackamas and Champooick (later Champoeg) districts. Yamhill district claimed the lands west of the Willamette River and a line extending from its course, {{and south of the}} Yamhill River. Champooick District was adjacent to the east, its northern border the confluence of <b>the</b> <b>Pudding</b> and Molalla Rivers. Twality District was directly north of Yamhill District, its eastern border extending {{from the mouth of the}} Willamette River. Clackamas District was to contain [...] "all the territory" [...] that wasn't decreed a part of the other three districts, located east of Twality District and north of Champooick District. The extent of land claimed north was vague, being [...] "south of the northern boundary of the United States". Despite this the government was defined to extend over all the lands east to the Rocky Mountains and north of the Mexican territory of Alta California.|$|E

500|$|Along {{with his}} duties at the Lampoon, Benchley {{acted in a}} number of {{theatrical}} productions, including Hasty Pudding productions of The Crystal Gazer and Below Zero. He also held the position of κροκόδιλος for <b>the</b> <b>Pudding</b> in 1912. Benchley kept these achievements in mind as he began to contemplate a career for himself after college. Charles Townsend Copeland, an English professor, recommended that Benchley go into writing, and Benchley and future Benchley illustrator Gluyas Williams from the Lampoon considered going into freelance work writing and illustrating theatrical reviews. Another English professor recommended that Benchley speak with the Curtis Publishing Company; but Benchley was initially against the idea, and ultimately took a position at a civil service office in Philadelphia. Owing to an academic failure in his senior year due to an illness, Benchley would not receive his Bachelor of Arts from Harvard until the completion of his credits in 1913. His shortcoming was the submission of a [...] "scholarly paper" [...] – which Benchley eventually rectified by a treatise on the U.S. – Canadian Fisheries Dispute, written {{from the point of view}} of a cod. He took a position with Curtis shortly after he received his diploma.|$|E
