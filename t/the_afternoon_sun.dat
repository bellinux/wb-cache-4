5|$|Sebastian Vettel led a Ferrari 1-2 {{in third}} {{practice}} ahead of Räikkönen, setting {{a time of}} 1:31.683. The two Mercedes drivers of Rosberg and Hamilton followed, ahead of Valtteri Bottas and Romain Grosjean. On the soft compound tyres, both Mercedes drivers had set identical times, before Rosberg edged out Hamilton on the super-softs. Higher temperatures in <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> meant that the times dropped from second practice. Felipe Massa ran a new, shorter nase for Williams, but managed only the ninth fastest time, {{more than half a}} second slower than teammate Bottas. Not running the super-soft tyres, Toro Rosso got its two drivers on 15th and 16th place respectively. Jolyon Palmer was 20th fastest before puncturing a tyre {{at the end of the}} session.|$|E
500|$|The Yankees' {{status as}} tenants of the Giants at the Polo Grounds had become {{increasingly}} uneasy, and in 1922, Giants owner Charles Stoneham {{stated that the}} Yankees' lease, expiring after that season, would not be renewed. Ruppert and Huston had long contemplated a new stadium, and had taken an option on property at 161st Street and River Avenue in the Bronx. Yankee Stadium was completed {{in time for the}} home opener on April 18, 1923, at which the Babe hit the first home run in what was quickly dubbed [...] "the House that Ruth Built". The ballpark was designed with Ruth in mind: although the venue's left-field fence was further from home plate than at the Polo Grounds, Yankee Stadium's right-field fence was closer, making home runs easier to hit for left-handed batters. To spare Ruth's eyes, right field–his defensive position–was not pointed into <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun,</b> as was traditional; left fielder Meusel was soon suffering headaches from squinting toward home plate.|$|E

60|$|They {{reached the}} {{outskirts}} of the city at about the middle of <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sun,</b> cold and yellow, hung above them in the colorless sky. Dorle stopped at the top of a ridge overlooking the city.|$|R
60|$|He lay without moving. <b>The</b> late <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> {{beat down}} on him. He felt sick, nauseated and feverish. His mouth was dry.|$|R
2500|$|Al Lang Stadium's {{grandstand}} {{faces the}} southeast, giving almost every seat {{a view of}} the St. Petersburg harbor and Tampa Bay beyond the left field wall. The stadium is constructed primarily of reinforced concrete, and the public portions of the facility include very few enclosed and air conditioned areas. A unique concrete cantilevered overhang shades many of the grandstand seats from <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun,</b> and the stadium's waterfront location is often cooled by a sea breeze. During the 2015 renovation, the Rowdies replaced all of the seats in the grandstand, refreshed fan areas under the grandstand, and extensively updated many of the club and gameday operation areas. In addition, a portion of the outfield wall was removed and two banks of uncovered bleachers installed in its place, adding several hundred seats on the sideline of the soccer pitch opposite the grandstand.|$|E
60|$|Hare-Lip {{leaped to}} his feet, giving {{a quick glance}} at the {{pasturing}} goats and <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun.</b>|$|E
60|$|Snow {{shrugged his}} {{shoulders}} and gazed bleakly at the smooth surface of the lagoon, where tiny wavelets danced in <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun.</b>|$|E
60|$|This {{vigilance}} continued all <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> sank; twilight {{spread its}} gray mantle, and soon black night enveloped the forest. The Indians halted, but made no fire; they sat close {{together on a}} stony ridge, silent and watchful.|$|R
50|$|In 1955, {{the morning}} Gazette & Bulletin and <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> Williamsport <b>Sun</b> were {{consolidated}} {{and became the}} Williamsport Sun-Gazette, <b>the</b> area's <b>afternoon</b> newspaper.|$|R
60|$|In <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> shone hot {{in their}} faces, for {{there were no}} trees to offer them shade; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and the Lion were tired, and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with the Woodman and the Scarecrow keeping watch.|$|R
60|$|There {{was their}} basket, {{just as they}} had left it, and <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> was shining softly over the {{familiar}} worldly landscape, which they were both rejoiced to see again.|$|E
6000|$|Lawford {{looked across}} {{in his mind}} at his square ungainly house, full-fronting <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun.</b> He tried to repress a shudder. 'I think, do you know, I ought to go to-day.' ...|$|E
60|$|Above {{the scarlet}} neckerchief a round face, red as a Normandy apple, was turned meditatively on the mud-stained cavalier, whilst {{a pair of}} small, beady eyes blinked drowsily at <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun.</b>|$|E
60|$|By {{one o'clock}} in <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> {{burst through the}} mist and an hour later the entire river was clear, {{so that they could}} see steamboats and sailboats a long {{distance}} off. The captain of the tug brought forth his spyglass and they took turns in looking through the instrument.|$|R
60|$|WE had dawdled {{over our}} luncheon before Mrs. Macallan arrived at Benjamin's cottage. The ensuing {{conversation}} {{between the old}} lady and myself (of which I have only presented a brief abstract) lasted until quite late in <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> was setting in heavy clouds when {{we got into the}} carriage, and the autumn twilight began to fall around us while we were still on the road.|$|R
60|$|After that Smoke {{occupied}} {{himself with}} drying his clothes. <b>The</b> late <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> beat warmly in upon him, and he wrung out his garments and spread them about him. His match-case was water-proof, and he manipulated and dried sufficient tobacco and rice-paper to make cigarettes.|$|R
60|$|But all was not over. Two days after, {{a shadow}} intruded into the window- pattern thrown on Rhoda Brook's floor by <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun.</b> The woman {{opened the door}} at once, almost breathlessly.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> {{is shining}} {{in a square}} of light through the open kitchen-door, whence one dreamily {{disposed}} might look far out to sea, and behold ships coming and going in every variety of shape and size.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun,</b> {{lying in}} broad patches on the bed-rugs, saw three boys and an {{umbrella}} disappear into a dormitory wall. In five minutes they emerged, brushed themselves all over, washed their hands, combed their hair, and descended.|$|E
25|$|The {{rectangular}} {{central area}} of the cricket field – the space used for pitches – {{is known as the}} square. Cricket pitches are usually oriented as close to the north-south direction as practical, because <b>the</b> low <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> would be dangerous for a batsman facing due west.|$|R

5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to <b>the</b> late <b>afternoon</b> or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Schools usually let out during <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> as well.|$|R
60|$|Her lips snapped together, and {{she fixed}} an unseeing stare across to where <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> was {{beginning}} to glow into sunset. I gazed {{for a moment at}} her face, white, plump, tiny, and implacable, and gave her up.|$|E
6000|$|The Bear and the Owl gravely {{watched this}} {{operation}} and nodded approval when Woot's silky green fur shone clear and bright in <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun.</b> The Canary seemed much amused and laughed a silvery ripple of laughter as she said: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> was {{throwing}} its level beams in between these many-colored ranges, {{and on one}} of them the ruins of an old Roman tower stood picturesquely prominent. The Simplon road could be seen, dividing the valley like an arrow.|$|E

60|$|The sky {{overhead}} {{was absolutely}} stainless, {{and the light}} of <b>the</b> cool <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> streamed upon <b>the</b> slopes of the solemn mountains to the east. The tall pines in the background blackened themselves against the horizon; nearer they showed more and more decidedly their bluish green, and the yellow of the newly fallen needles painted their aisles deep into the airy shadows.|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> December <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> {{struck in}} at the windows, and fell across {{the heads of the}} busy scholars, and as he looked, Dr. Thatcher was a boy again, and Rose and her companions were the [...] "big girls" [...] of the school.

6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to build a cathedral one of these days," [...] said I to my wife, as I sat looking at the slant line of light made by <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> on our picture of the Cathedral of Milan.|$|E
6000|$|But {{to show in}} <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun,</b> With {{an aspect}} of hollow-eyed care, When none wished to see me come there, Was a garish thing, better undone. [...] Yes; wrong was the way; [...] But yet, let me say, [...] I may right it--some day.|$|E
60|$|I {{remember}} the Crusaders, how they called here so often {{on their way}} to the East. And Trapani seems waiting for them still, with its palm trees and its silence, full in <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun.</b> It has not much to do but wait, apparently.|$|E
50|$|In February 2007, {{nearly a}} year before she last {{appeared}} on screen, Honey was killed after a vet accidentally shot her {{in the wrong place}} with a tranquilizer dart. The dart did not go into the muscle but hit her in the stomach near her kidneys. Oblivious to his mistake, the vet went on to treat Honey's cub while she was left out in <b>the</b> scorching <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun.</b>|$|R
50|$|The regatta in the {{background}} suggests a Saturday, and the beams from <b>the</b> late <b>afternoon</b> <b>sun</b> passing through <b>the</b> windows {{on both sides of}} the Grand Pier Pavilion suggest a time of around 4.30pm. Among the public, a private nurse in uniform can be seen on the right, and the deckchair boys employed from age 12 are near the left foreground in the aisle between stage and fence.|$|R
60|$|We {{drove off}} from the Springs Hotel about three in <b>the</b> <b>afternoon.</b> <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> warmed me to the heart. A broad, cool wind {{streamed}} pauselessly down the valley, laden with perfume. Up at the top stood Mount Saint Helena, a bulk of mountain, bare atop, with tree- fringed spurs, and radiating warmth. Once we saw it framed in a grove of tall and exquisitely graceful white oaks, in line and colour a finished composition. We passed a cow stretched by the roadside, her bell slowly beating time to the movement of her ruminating jaws, her big red face crawled over by half a dozen flies, a monument of content.|$|R
