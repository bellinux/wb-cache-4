5|$|Stratton saw humans not as {{machines}} {{to be analyzed}} mechanistically, but also as seating will, emotion and drives, all of which had to analyzed as scientifically as the traditional psychological concepts of sensation, perception and memory. He also believed in a supreme actuality behind the world registered by our senses. This was the theme of his last published book, Man-Creator or Destroyer, completed in 1952 when he was eighty-seven years old. His book Developing Mental Power was a foray into educational psychology, addressing the question of general versus specific training in terms <b>teachers</b> <b>could</b> understand and use. Stratton aimed at this goal via a simple and generally applicable look at the basic workings of mental life. John F. Dashiell, writing in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, found this a failure. Dashiell saw the path from the psychological concepts—emotion, intelligence, and will—to teaching methodology, not clearly described in the book. Stratton also applied psychological concepts {{to figure out how}} to avert war. He was optimistic it was possible to harness the creative and destructive facets of individuals to get nations to coexist peacefully. He saw nations as consisting of ethnicities and races which had to coexist in harmony. In line with the prevailing view in his field, he did not see the races as inherently equally intelligent.|$|E

25|$|The {{immediate}} effect of collapse of Nova was the sudden unemployment of approximately 4,500 foreign teaching staff and 2,000 Japanese workers.

25|$|Determined {{to succeed}} as an administrator, Clerk preached {{self-reliance}} and self-sufficiency, refusing to ask Missionary Societies abroad for funds This attitude was unpopular {{at home as}} the church was facing a financial crisis; while <b>teachers</b> <b>could</b> then earn good government salaries, Presbyterian pastors had to live on very modest stipends that the church could afford. He cooperated with the Scottish missionaries after he had got over his initial suspicion of them. As Synod Clerk of the church, he emphasised the continued use of indigenous languages in church and school, and insisted on an unassuming and austere lifestyle. Clerk also attempted to forge unity between the Presbyterian church and the Evangelical Presbyterian church but his unification effort was futile.|$|E
25|$|Other {{observers}} {{have criticized the}} thoroughness of the investigation, and the validity of its conclusions. The author James Baldwin, in his essay The Evidence of Things Not Seen (1985), raised questions about Williams' guilt. Members of his community {{and several of the}} victims' parents did not believe that Williams, the son of two professional <b>teachers,</b> <b>could</b> have killed so many. On May 6, 2005, DeKalb County Police Chief Louis Graham ordered the reopening of the murder cases of four boys killed in that county between February and May 1981 that had been attributed to Williams. The announcement was welcomed by relatives of some victims, who said they believe the wrong man was blamed for many of the murders.|$|E

500|$|Another {{legislative}} package {{was introduced by}} State Senators Armistead Boothe and Ted Dalton. The Boothe-Dalton plan was less ambitious in scope. It proposed a plan in which: 1) Student school assignments would be made on factors other than race; 2) Parents unhappy with their child's school assignment would have access to an administrative appeals system; and 3) <b>Teachers</b> <b>could</b> transfer schools only as conditions warranted. The key element of the Boothe-Dalton plan was in how it differed from the Gray Commission student assignment plan. The Gray Commission plan assigned students {{on the basis of}} student welfare, availability of facilities and transportation, health, and aptitude, whereas the Boothe-Dalton plan expanded the list of factors to include school attendance areas, academic background, student personality, and student needs. Additionally, the Boothe-Dalton plan provided for an administrative appeal process, which the Gray Commission plan did not. It also identified a very specific, time-consuming process for assignment appeals (to the local school board, the state board of education, state circuit courts, state supreme court, and eventually the U.S. Supreme Court). Finally, it contained a [...] "local option" [...] that would allow racial integration in public schools [...] "where localities are ready" [...] (according to Boothe).|$|E

2500|$|It was in 1958 {{that the}} Bahá'ís of Kampala {{contracted}} to reserve {{a segment of}} a cemetery for use by Bahá'ís. Weekend schools begun in 1958 continued through 1960 though classes now used chapters from Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era by John Esslemont. In September 1961, a number of permanent Bahá'í schools were set uptwo Louis Gregory Bahá'í Schools, one in Tilling, the home town of Olinga, {{and the other in}} Dusai. Courses emphasized homecraft and child rearing mixed with presentations on the religion and men supported women taking the courses. News of the openings was covered in Jet Magazine. The extraordinary number of enrollments in Uganda and Kenya had reached the point in late 1959 that the institution of the Hands of the Cause were noting there were not enough Bahá'ís {{to keep up with the}} work of checking the enrollments. [...] 1961 also saw the development of a Ugandan Bahá'í publishing trust. Olinga was able to re-visit Uganda in June, and again in August–September 1962 when he toured widely in Uganda speaking to many groups amounting to thousands of people about the religion before moving on to Kenya and Tanganyika and the Congo. As the monthly rate of growth reached into the hundreds, a goal of the Uganda Teaching Committee was of stimulating the individual assemblies and believers to assume increasing responsibility for weekend schools in their own villages so that traveling <b>teachers</b> <b>could</b> focus in other areas. In September 1962 Milton Obote, then Prime Minister of Uganda, visited the Shrine of the Bab. In 1963 Nakhjavani was elected to the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the worldwide Bahá'í community, while Olinga chaired the first Bahá'í World Congress which announced the election to the world. [...] By the end of 1963 there were 554 Local Spiritual Assemblies in various localities, 389 smaller Bahá'í groups, and some 200 isolated individual Bahá'ís spread across Uganda. In 1964 the regional Assemblies were reassigned and Uganda joined with the Central African Republic. The July 1964 issue of Uganda Argus profiled the religion as well as a broad article about the 4 Bahá'í Houses of Worship then in existence. One hundred thirty-two delegates and visitors assembled in Kampala, Uganda, for the 1966 convention to elect the regional national assembly of Uganda and Central Africa. Olinga was able to visit Uganda again from October to December 1967 for an extended tour of the country. Rapid expansion of the religion in the late 1960s was most particularly true in Uganda, Vietnam and Indonesia. The 1968 membership of the regional national assembly of Uganda and Central Africa was: Hassan Sabri, Tito Wanantsrusri, Kolonerio Oule, Elizabeth Olinga, George William Ebetu, Moses Senoga, Sospateri Isimai, Alinote Colleque, and Albert Ocnamodek. During the period of Ayyám-i-Há 1969 the Bahá'ís had a public exhibit on the religion at the Kamapala national theatre. The mayor of Kampala spoke at the opening preceding the showing of the film, [...] "And His Name Shall Be One". The exhibit consisted of books, charts, artifacts, photographs, movies, slides, and recordings. Original Tablets, books, and excerpts written by the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh, and `Abdu'l-Bahá were displayed along with secondary works. Bahá'í history was illustrated in a chart depicting events from the birth of Bahá'u'lláh to the founding of the Universal House of Justice, plus displays of The Dawn-Breakers in three languages. The arts were shown in oil paintings, photographs, silverwork, and handwoven carpets and the diversity of nationalities and religious backgrounds was illustrated with photographs and slides taken during conventions, Temple dedications, and intercontinental conferences. Later that summer Ruhiyyih Khanum visited Uganda on a ten-day tour. In Kampala she was able to attend several events before driving into the countryside to visit Bahá'ís. In town events included: a reception given in her honor and that of two visiting members of the Universal House of Justice, Hushmand Fatheazam and 'Ali Nahkjavani; to deliver a public lecture in the hall of the national theater; to be interviewed for a full half hour on Radio Uganda on the [...] "Guest of the Week" [...] program; and attend a wedding at the temple along with fellow Hands of the Cause Enoch Olinga and Músá Bánaní before going on to Ethiopia and other countries on a four-month tour. She returned at the end of the tour for a few days of low key meetings with Bahá'ís before her final departure.|$|E

40|$|The {{teaching}} English vocabulary in Elementary School {{was different}} from teaching in Junior High School or Senior High School.

The teaching learning process was conducted by using Classroom Action Research (CAR). The result of teaching English vocabulary using audiovisual aids for the first grade students of SDN 2 Sawahan improved.

The advantages of teaching English using audiovisual aids are: 1) the <b>teacher</b> <b>could</b> control the classroom situation easily; 2) the <b>teacher</b> <b>could</b> teach the students easily; 3) the students could be interested in learning English; 4) the students could know how to spell the words correctly; 5) the teaching-learning process became funny and happy, and 6) the students became active. The disadvantages of teaching English vocabulary using audiovisual aids are: 1) the teacher took more time to prepare the projector; 2) the <b>teacher</b> <b>could</b> not teach using audiovisual everyday; 3) the teaching-leaning process could not run well if the electrical power went down, and 4) the teaching-learning could not run well if the teacher didn’t understand how to use the audiovisual aids...|$|R
