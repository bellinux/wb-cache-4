Direct review {{means that the}} Supreme Court hears cases directly upon appeal without the case first going to the Court of Appeals. Other direct review items include state agency decisions such as the placement of prisons, placement of energy production facilities, locations of sites for solid waste disposal, and some labor law injunctions. Additionally, the court has original jurisdiction in, writs of mandamus, writs quo warranto, writs of habeas corpus, reapportionment of state legislative districts, and challenges to ballot measures such as their titles, the fiscal impact statement, and <b>the</b> <b>explanatory</b> statement as listed in the Voter’s Pamphlet.|$|E
5|$|Biogeography has a {{long history}} in the natural {{sciences}} concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide <b>the</b> <b>explanatory</b> context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as migration and dispersal. and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography. There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of global warming.|$|E

25|$|This is a {{collection}} of four tantras which comprise the basis of Traditional Tibetan Medicine.

The Root Tantra has six chapters and gives (1) an introduction, (2) general outline of topics, (3) the basis of disease, (4) diagnosis, (5) methods of treatment, and (6) an enumeration of the metaphors used in Traditional Tibetan Medicine. <b>The</b> <b>Explanatory</b> Tantra is divided into eleven divisions and thirty-one chapters, and covers (1) a summary of fundamentals, (2) the life cycle, (3) fundamentals of pathology, (4) behavior and lifestyle, (5) diet, (6) pharmacology, (7) tools of the physician, (8) health and prevention, (9) diagnosis, (10) method of treatment, and (11) ethics of a physician. The Oral-instruction Tantra has fifteen divisions that are explained in ninety-two chapters; the divisions include (1) pathology of the three humors, (2) internal disorders, (3) fever, (4)pathology of the upper parts of the body, (5) pathology of the solid and hollow organs, (6) genital disorders, (7) common diseases, (8) dermatology, (9) pediatrics, (10) gynecological disorders, (11) disorders caused by spirit provocation, (12) injury, (13) toxicology, (14) longevity, and (15) aphrodisiacs.

25|$|Isaac Newton's (1642–1727) {{mathematical}} {{explanation of}} universal gravitation explained the behavior both of objects {{here on earth}} and of objects in the heavens {{in a way that}} promoted a worldview in which the natural universe is controlled by laws of nature. This, in turn, suggested a theology in which God created the universe, set it in motion controlled by natural law and retired from the scene. The new awareness of <b>the</b> <b>explanatory</b> power of universal natural law also produced a growing skepticism about such religious staples as miracles (violations of natural law) and about religious books that reported them.|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{theories}} of magic treat magic {{as a personal}} phenomenon intended to meet individual needs, {{as opposed to a}} social phenomenon serving a collective purpose. <b>The</b> <b>explanatory</b> power of magic should not be underestimated, however.

25|$|One problem {{posed by}} the {{question}} of the existence of God is that traditional beliefs usually ascribe to God various supernatural powers. Supernatural beings may be able to conceal and reveal themselves for their own purposes, as for example in the tale of Baucis and Philemon. In addition, according to concepts of God, God {{is not part of the}} natural order, but the ultimate creator of nature and of the scientific laws. Thus in Aristotelian philosophy, God is viewed as part of <b>the</b> <b>explanatory</b> structure needed to support scientific conclusions and any powers God possesses are—strictly speaking—of the natural order that is derived from God's place as originator of nature (see also Monadology).|$|E
25|$|The {{first edition}} of A Greek-English Lexicon by Henry George Liddell and Robert Scott {{appeared}} in 1843; this work remained the basic dictionary of Greek {{until the end of}} the 20th century. And in 1858 was published the first volume of the Deutsches Wörterbuch by the Brothers Grimm; the work was completed in 1961. Between 1861 and 1874 was published the Dizionario della lingua italiana by Niccolò Tommaseo. Between 1862 and 1874 was published the six volumes of A magyar nyelv szótára (Dictionary of Hungarian Language) by Gergely Czuczor and János Fogarasi. Émile Littré published the Dictionnaire de la langue française between 1863 and 1872.

40|$|The common {{procedure}} to estimate Gravity equations with panel data {{is based on}} the OLS of the transformed log-linear specification including several fixed effects to control for country unobserved heterogeneity. This may lead to a lack of efficiency due to the great number of parameters to be estimated (especially if panels have few time periods) and makes impossible the estimation of the effect of time-invariant variables. On the other hand, the log-linear specification of the gravity equation has found to lead often to inconsistent estimation, as first has been noticed by Santos Silva and Tenreyro (2006). They propose to use instead the Poisson regression with robust variances as a pseudo maximum likelihood estimator. Recently Westerlund and Wilhelmsson (2009) use the Poisson …xed e¤ects estimator for panel data (with robust variances) which accommodates unobserved individual heterogeneity correlated with <b>the</b> <b>explanatories.</b> Based on <b>the</b> recent work of Lombardia and Sperlich (2008) on multilevel regression we introduce a nonparametric component in the gravity panel equation that captures country unobserved heterogeneity dependent on <b>the</b> <b>explanatories</b> without compromising <b>the</b> estimate of the effect of time invariant variables and the estimation of the untransformed nonlinear gravity equation...|$|R
