40|$|Abstract—One of {{the power}} quality {{concerns}} that have received most attention {{is the problem of}} harmonics which are generated by widely dispersed single phase nonlinear loads. Such loads cause harmonic distortion of voltages and currents in a power distribution system. In order to fully understand the problem of harmonic distortion, an effective means of identifying the harmonic patterns generated by different types of nonlinear loads is considered. This paper presents the application of fractal analysis for analyzing various harmonic current waveforms generated by typical nonlinear loads such as personal computer, fluorescent lights and uninterruptible power supply. The fractal technique provides both time and spectral information of the nonlinear load harmonic patterns. <b>The</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>results</b> <b>shows</b> that the various harmonic current waveforms can be easily identified from the characteristics of the fractal features.

Therefore, {{there is a need}} for more research to study the effect of skew angle on the performance of skew bridges. In the present work, the effect of change in skew angles with right bridge is studied by two well established analysis methods; finite element method and grillage analogy method. Longitudinal moment, reaction at support, deflection and transverse moment are computed by FEM and grillage analogy method and results are compared for different skew angles. Simple supported single span bridge is considered in this study. <b>The</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>results</b> <b>shows</b> that as skew angle increases, reaction increases, bending moment decreases but torsion and transverse moment increases up to a certain angle, after which it decreases.

40|$|A wobble {{instability}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} problems of a three-wheeled vehicle commonly used in India, and these instabilities are of great interest to industry and academia. In this paper, we studied this instability using a multi-body dynamic model and with experiments conducted on a prototype three-wheeled vehicle on a test track. The multi-body dynamic model of a three-wheeled vehicle is developed using the commercial software ADAMS/Car. In an initial model, all components including main structures such as the frame, the steering column and the rear forks are assumed to be rigid bodies. A linear eigenvalue analysis, which is carried out at different speeds, reveals a mode that has predominantly a steering oscillation, also called a wobble mode, with a frequency of around 5 - 6 Hz. <b>The</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>results</b> <b>shows</b> that the damping of this mode is low but positive up to the maximum speed of the three-wheeled vehicle. However, the experimental study shows that the mode is unstable at speeds below 8. 33 m/s. To predict and study this instability in detail, a more refined model of the three-wheeled vehicle, with flexibilities of three important bodies, was constructed in ADAMS/Car. With flexible bodies, three modes of a steering oscillation were observed. Two of these are well damped and the other is lightly damped with negative damping at lower speeds. Simulation results with flexibility incorporated show a good match with the instability observed in the experimental studies. Further, we investigated the effect of each flexible body and found that the flexibility of the steering column is the major contributor for wobble instability and is similar to the wheel shimmy problem in aircraft...|$|E
40|$|Objective: A metaschema is an {{abstraction}} network of the UMLS’s Semantic Network (SN) ob-tained from a connected partition of its collection of semantic types. A lexical metaschema was previously derived {{based on a}} lexical partition which partitioned the SN into semantic-type groups using identical word-usage among the names of semantic types and the defini-tions of their respective children. In this paper, a statistical analysis methodology is presented to evaluate the lexical metaschema based on a study involving a group of established UMLS experts. Design: In the study, each expert was asked to identify subject areas of the SN based {{on his or her}} understanding of the various semantic types. For this purpose, the expert scans the SN hierarchy top-down, identifying semantic types, which are important and different enough from their parent semantic types, as roots of their groups. From the response of each expert, an “expert metaschema ” is constructed. The different experts ’ metaschemas can vary widely. So, additional metaschemas are obtained from aggregations of the experts ’ responses. Of special interest is the consensus metaschema which represents an aggregation of a simple majority of the experts ’ responses. Statistical analysis comparing the lexical metaschema with the experts ’ metaschemas and the consensus metaschema is presented. Results: <b>The</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>results</b> <b>shows</b> that 17 out of the 21 meta-semantic types in the lexical meta-schema also appear in the consensus metaschema (about 81 %).
