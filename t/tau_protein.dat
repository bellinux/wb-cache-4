5|$|Emphasis in Alzheimer's {{research}} {{has been placed on}} diagnosing the condition before symptoms begin. A number of biochemical tests have been developed to attempt earlier detection. One such test involves the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid for beta-amyloid or tau proteins, both total <b>tau</b> <b>protein</b> and phosphorylated tau181P protein concentrations.|$|E
5|$|AD is also {{considered}} a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the <b>tau</b> <b>protein.</b> Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an internal support structure partly {{made up of}} structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules {{from the body of}} the cell {{to the ends of the}} axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{sometimes}} {{refer to}} Parkinson’s disease as a synucleiopathy (due to an abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein protein in the brain) to {{distinguish it from}} other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease where the brain accumulates <b>tau</b> <b>protein.</b> Considerable clinical and pathological overlap exists between tauopathies and synucleinopathies. In contrast to Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease presents most commonly with memory loss, and the cardinal signs of Parkinson's disease (slowness, tremor, stiffness, and postural instability) are not normal features of Alzheimer's.|$|E
40|$|Eleven anti-neurofilament (anti-NF) {{monoclonal}} antibodies {{were studied}} for their reactivity with heat-stable, microtubule-associated proteins and Alzheimer neurofibrillary tangles (ANT). On immunoblots of NF proteins, the antibodies recognized epitopes that were variably sensitive to Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase. Eight of the antibodies showed reactivity with ANT and decreased binding to electroblotted NF after phosphatase treatment. The same eight antibodies reacted with <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> from bovine and rat brain, binding to <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> was also substantially reduced by phosphatase. Of the eight antibodies that bound to animal <b>tau</b> <b>proteins,</b> five also bound to <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> from normal human brain. All of the antibodies that bound to animal <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> stained ANT in frozen tissue sections. Brief treatment of tissue sections with trypsin {{in most cases}} enhanced antibody binding to ANT. All antibodies that lacked reactivity with <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> failed to bind ANT. Phosphatase treatment of Alzheimer tissue sections did not change the immunoreactivity of ANT and neurites in senile plaques with ANT-reactive, anti-NF antibodies, except for two antibodies that showed decreased binding to ANT. In contrast, axonal staining was decreased or eliminated by phosphatase treatment, similar to the response of electroblotted NF and <b>tau</b> <b>proteins.</b> These results suggest that staining of ANT by anti-NF antibodies {{may be due to}} cross-reaction of anti-NF with epitopes in <b>tau</b> <b>proteins,</b> the epitopes in axons, NF, and tau are sensitive to the effect of phosphatase, whereas the majority of those in ANT are not, and some of the epitopes in ANT that are shared with NF and <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> are not readily accessible to antibody binding...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTau {{proteins}} are abnormally phosphorylated in Alzheimer's disease. Pathological <b>Tau</b> <b>proteins</b> named PHF-Tau 55, PHF-Tau 64, and PHF-Tau 69, are {{the main}} constituents of the paired helical filaments (PHF). When treating SKNSH-SY 5 Y cells with okadaic acid (OA), <b>Tau</b> 55 <b>protein</b> was clearly induced whereas <b>Tau</b> 64 <b>protein</b> was only faintly induced. Here, we show {{that the absence of}} Tau 69 could be {{explained by the fact that}} adult isoforms containing N-terminal inserts are not detected. Phosphorylation is similar for untreated cellular <b>Tau</b> <b>proteins</b> and fetal <b>Tau</b> <b>proteins,</b> while OA cell treatment transformed fetal-type into Alzheimer-type phosphorylated proteins...|$|R
40|$|The {{differential}} {{distribution and}} phosphorylation of <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> in cat cerebellum was studied with two well characterized antibodies, TAU- 1 and TAU- 2. TAU- 1 detects <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> in axons, and the epitope in perikarya and dendrites is masked by phosphorylation. TAU- 2 detects a phosphorylation-independent epitope on <b>tau</b> <b>proteins.</b> The molecular composition of <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> {{in the range}} of 45 kD to 64 kD at birth changed after the first postnatal month to a set of several adult variants of higher molecular weights {{in the range of}} 59 kD to 95 kD. The appearance of <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> in subsets of axons corresponds to the axonal maturation of cerebellar local-circuit neurons in granular and molecular layers and confirms previous studies. <b>Tau</b> <b>proteins</b> were also identified in synapses by immunofluorescent double-staining with synapsin I, located in the pinceau around the Purkinje cells, and in glomeruli. Dephosphorylation of juvenile cerebellar tissue by alkaline phosphatase indicated indirectly the presence of differentially phosphorylated tau forms mainly in juvenile ages. Additional TAU- 1 immunoreactivity was unmasked in numerous perikarya and dendrites of stellate cells, and in cell bodies of granule cells. Purkinje cell bodies were stained transiently at juvenile ages. During postnatal development, the intensity of the phosphate-dependent staining decreased, suggesting that phosphorylation of <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> in perikarya and dendrites may be essential for early steps in neuronal morphogenesis during cat cerebellum development...|$|R
5|$|The tau {{hypothesis}} {{proposes that}} <b>tau</b> <b>protein</b> abnormalities initiate the disease cascade. In this model, hyperphosphorylated tau begins to pair with other threads of tau. Eventually, they form neurofibrillary tangles inside nerve cell bodies. When this occurs, the microtubules disintegrate, destroying {{the structure of}} the cell's cytoskeleton which collapses the neuron's transport system. This may result first in malfunctions in biochemical communication between neurons and later in the death of the cells.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease has}} been {{identified}} as a protein misfolding disease (proteopathy), caused by plaque accumulation of abnormally folded amyloid beta protein, and <b>tau</b> <b>protein</b> in the brain. Plaques are made up of small peptides, 39–43amino acids in length, called amyloid beta (Aβ). Aβ is a fragment from the larger amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is a transmembrane protein that penetrates through the neuron's membrane. APP is critical to neuron growth, survival, and post-injury repair. In Alzheimer's disease, gamma secretase and beta secretase act together in a proteolytic process which causes APP to be divided into smaller fragments. One of these fragments gives rise to fibrils of amyloid beta, which then form clumps that deposit outside neurons in dense formations known as senile plaques.|$|E

500|$|ApoER2 {{interaction}} with reelin and ApoE has implications with Alzheimer’s disease. [...] Binding of reelin to ApoER2 leads to cascade of signals that modulate NMDA receptor functions. [...] ApoE competes with reelin in binding to ApoER2 resulting in weakened reelin signaling. Reduced reelin signaling leads to impaired plasticity in neurons {{and increases in}} the phosphorylation of <b>tau</b> <b>protein,</b> which is a microtubule stabilizing protein that is abundant in the Central Nervous System (CNS), producing neurofibrillary tangles which are implicated in Alzheimer’s disease.|$|E
500|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} {{the most common form of}} dementia, and studies have shown that {{manipulation}} of pathways involving LRP8/ApoER2 can lead to the disease. [...] Certain alleles, such as apoe, app, ps1 and ps2, may lead to being genetically predisposed to the disease. A decrease in LRP8 expression is observed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. [...] An example of a decrease in expression of LRP8 is when gamma secretase cleaves LRP8 as well as the ligand amyloid precursor protein (APP). [...] The degradation products control transcription factors, which lead to the expression of a <b>tau</b> <b>protein.</b> [...] The cascade dysfunction caused by the altered gene expression may be implicated with Alzheimer’s disease.|$|E
500|$|In development, reelin is {{secreted}} by Cajal-Retzius cells. [...] Reelin {{acts as an}} extracellular {{ligand binding}} to ApoER2 and VLDLR on migrating neurons. A specific lysine residue on reelin binds to the first repeat on the ligand binding domain of ApoER2. This interaction with the two receptors activates intracellular processes that begin with the phosphorylation of Dab1, a tyrosine kinase phosphorylated protein which is encoded by the DAB1 gene. This protein associates with the NPXY motifs on the intracellular tails of ApoER2 and VLDLR. Upon reelin binding, Dab1 is phosphorylated by two tyrosine kinases, Fyn and Src. The phosphorylated Dab1 then causes further activation of these two kinases and others, including a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K activation leads to inhibitory phosphorylation of the tau kinase glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B), which alters the activity of <b>tau</b> <b>protein,</b> a protein involved in stabilizing microtubules. This transduction is combined with the activation of other pathways that influence the cytoskeletal rearrangement necessary for proper cortical cell migration.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tau</b> <b>proteins</b> {{consist of}} a family of proteins, {{heterogeneous}} in size, which associate with microtubules in vivo and are induced during neurite outgrowth. In humans, tau {{is one of the major}} components of the pathognomonic neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease brain. Screening of a cDNA library prepared from bovine brain led to the isolation of several cDNA clones encoding <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> with different N termini and differing by insertions or deletions, suggesting differential splicing of the tau transcripts. One of the N-terminal domains and the repeated C-terminal domain of the encoded <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> are recognized by polyclonal antibodies to bovine tau. The bovine <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> are highly homologous to murine and human tau, especially within the repeated C-terminal domain. Compared with murine and human tau, bovine tau contains the insertion of three longer segments, one of which is an additional characteristic repeat. Portions of <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> generated by in vitro translation were used to show that these repeats represent tubulin-binding domains, two of which are sufficient to bind to microtubules assembled from purified tubulin in the presence of taxol...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{study the}} effects of Xixin {{decoction}} (XXD) on O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) glycosylation of <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> in rat brain with sporadic Alzheimer disease (SAD), and discuss its possible mechanism on prevention and treatment of SAD. MethodsThe rat model of SAD was established by intracerebroventricular injection of streptozotocin. The specific pathogen free male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham-operation group (S), model group (M), donepezil group (D), XXD at a low dose group (XL), XXD at a medium dose group (XM) and XXD at a high dose group (XH). After treatment and praxiology test, immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to detect O-GlcNAc glycosylation level of <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> in rat brain with SAD. O-GlcNAc glycosylation and expression of <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> were detected by O-GlcNAc-specific antibodies RL 2 and CTD 110. 6. ResultsO-GlcNAc glycosylated proteins enriched by succinylated wheat germ agglutinin significantly improved in the hippocampus of SAD rats. The differences were statistically significant among XXD groups (P 0. 05). ConclusionXXD can significantly improve O-GlcNAc glycosylation level of <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> in the hippocampus of SAD rats, which maybe inhibit hyperphosphorylation of <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> on key sites and its toxicity, and prevent the pathological process of SAD...|$|R
2500|$|... (+)-Discodermolide {{has also}} {{been found to be}} neuroprotective in recent Alzheimer research. The microtubule-stabilizing feature of (+)-discodermolide was used to restore neuron {{functions}} that have been disrupted by the amyloid induced sequestration. <b>Tau</b> <b>protein</b> is known to stabilize the microtubule network in healthy neurons. It served as the “railroad track” upon which actin, tubulin, mitochondria, neurotransmitter-related enzymes and vesicles carrying messenger proteins are delivered. The presence of Amyloid in the cell could lead to <b>tau</b> <b>protein</b> aggregation and microtubule numbers reduction. [...] In transgenic mouse model for human tauopathy, (+)-discodermolide stabilizes microtubules and restores fast axonal transport in cells, offsetting the loss of function caused by aggregation of <b>tau</b> <b>protein.</b> The motor-impaired mice exhibited a full restoration of normal movement with (+)-discodermolide treatment.|$|E

2500|$|Researchers {{have found}} a {{correlation}} between quinolinic acid and Alzheimer's disease. For example, studies have found in the post-mortem brains of Alzheimer’s disease patients higher neuronal quinolinic acid levels and that quinolinic acid can associate with <b>tau</b> <b>protein.</b> Furthermore, researchers have demonstrated that quinolinic acid increases tau phosphorylation in vitro in human fetal neurons [...] and induces ten neuronal genes including some known to correlate with Alzheimer’s disease. In immunoreactivity studies, {{researchers have found that}} quinolinic acid immunoreactivity is strongest in glial cells that are located close to amyloid plaques and that there is immunoreactivity with neurofibrillary tangles.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMicrotubule-associated <b>Tau</b> <b>proteins</b> are {{the basic}} {{component}} of intraneuronal and glial inclusions observed in many neurological disorders, the so-called tauopathies. Many etiological factors, phosphorylation, splicing, and mutations, relate <b>Tau</b> <b>proteins</b> to neurodegeneration. Molecular analysis has revealed that hyperphosphorylation and abnormal phosphorylation {{might be one of}} the important events in the process leading to tau intracellular aggregation. Specific set of pathological <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> exhibiting a typical biochemical pattern, and a different regional and laminar distribution, could characterize five main classes of tauopathies. A direct correlation has been established between the regional brain distribution of tau pathology and clinical symptoms; for instance progressive involvement of neocortical areas is well correlated to the severity of dementia in Alzheimer's disease, overall suggesting that pathological <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> are reliable marker of the neurodegenerative process. Recent discovery of tau gene mutations in frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 has reinforced the predominant role attributed to <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, and underlined the fact that distinct sets of tau isoforms expressed in different neuronal populations could lead to different pathologies. Overall, a better knowledge of the etiological factors responsible for the aggregation of <b>tau</b> <b>proteins</b> in brain diseases is essential for development of future differential diagnosis and therapeutic strategies. They would hopefully find their application against Alzheimer's disease but also in all neurological disorders for which a dysfunction of Tau biology has been identified...|$|R

2500|$|The {{protective}} effects of apomorphine {{were tested in}} mouse models with mutations in genes related to AD, such as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, which is implicated in amyloid molecule build-up. [...] Apomorphine was seen to significantly improve memory function through the increased successful completion of the Morris Water Maze. [...] The levels of the aberrant proteins that lead to neuronal disruption were also tested in the brains of mice. [...] Treatment was seen to decrease the intraneuronal levels of the more aggressive Aβ42 molecule {{when compared to the}} control mice. [...] This result is consistent with the finding that another protein linked to AD, <b>tau</b> <b>protein,</b> was seen to decrease with apomorphine treatment. [...] Apomorphine was shown to promote Aβ degradation and inhibit formation through its anti-oxidative properties. Moderate doses were shown to provide the improvements while overuse provided no benefits and may even cause toxicity.|$|E
2500|$|Pathologically, DLB is {{characterized}} by the development of abnormal collections of (alpha-synuclein) protein within the cytoplasm of neurons (known as Lewy bodies). These intracellular collections of protein have similar structural features to [...] "classical" [...] Lewy bodies, seen subcortically in Parkinson's disease. Additionally, those affected by DLB experience a loss of dopamine-producing neurons (in the substantia nigra) {{in a manner similar to}} that seen in Parkinson's disease. A loss of acetylcholine-producing neurons (in the basal nucleus of Meynert and elsewhere) similar to that seen in Alzheimer's disease also is known to occur in those with DLB. Cerebral atrophy also occurs as the cerebral cortex degenerates. [...] Autopsy series have revealed the pathology of DLB is often concomitant with the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. That is, when Lewy body inclusions are found in the cortex, they often co-occur with Alzheimer's disease pathology found primarily in the hippocampus, including senile plaques (deposited beta-amyloid protein), and granulovacuolar degeneration (grainy deposits within and a clear zone around hippocampal neurons). Neurofibrillary tangles (abnormally phosphorylated <b>tau</b> <b>protein)</b> are less common in DLB, although they are known to occur, and astrocyte abnormalities are also known to occur. Presently, whether DLB is an Alzheimer's variant or a separate disease entity is not clear. Unlike Alzheimer's disease, the brain may appear grossly normal with no visible signs of atrophy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tau</b> <b>protein</b> {{belongs to}} a group of Microtubule Associated Proteins (MAPs) which, among several things, help {{stabilize}} microtubules in cells, including neurons. Association and stabilizing activity of <b>tau</b> <b>protein</b> depends on its phosphorylated state. In Alzheimer's disease, due to misfoldings and abnormal conformational changes in <b>tau</b> <b>protein</b> structure, it is rendered ineffective at binding to microtubules and thus unable to keep the neural cytoskeletal structure organized during neural processes; in fact abnormal tau inhibits and disrupts microtubule organization and disengages normal tau from microtubules into cytosolic phase. The misfoldings lead to the abnormal aggregation into fibrillary tangles inside the neurons, the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. There is an adequate amount that the <b>tau</b> <b>protein</b> needs to be phosphorylated to function, but hyperphosphorylation of <b>tau</b> <b>protein</b> is thought {{to be one of the}} major influences on its incapacity to associate. Kinases PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C dephosphorylate <b>tau</b> <b>protein</b> in vitro, and their activities have found to be reduced in areas of the brain in Alzheimer patients. Tau phosphoprotein is three to fourfold hyperphosphorylated in an Alzheimer patient compared to an aged non-afflicted individual. Alzheimer disease tau seems to remove MAP1 and MAP2 (two other major associated proteins) from microtubules and this deleterious effect is reversed when dephosphorylation is performed, evidencing hyperphosphorylation as the sole cause of the crippling activity.|$|E

40|$|In situ" {{hybridization}} and immunohistochemical {{analysis of}} the expression of Tau mRNAs and <b>Tau</b> <b>proteins</b> in the developing cerebellum showed that: 1. At early postnatal stages Tau mRNAs are expressed in the deeper region of the external granular layer (EGL II) i. e. in the cells that begin to migrate from the proliferative zone. Little labeling {{was seen in the}} upper layer (EGL I) where the cerebellar interneurons actively proliferate during the first two postnatal weeks. Anti-Tau antibodies failed to detect <b>Tau</b> <b>proteins</b> both in EGL I and II. 2. Tau transcripts were also clearly detected in the migrating cells present in the molecular layer; no Tau immunoreactivity was seen in this layer. This suggests that Tau mRNAs remain very poorly translated in the migrating granule cells and in the other interneurons. 3. <b>Tau</b> <b>proteins</b> begin to be detected at postnatal day 8 in the molecular layer but only {{at the level of the}} parallel fibers that are present in the Purkinje cell dendritic field. This suggests that the Tau mRNAs transcribed in the migrating cells are not actively translated for several days and that <b>Tau</b> <b>proteins</b> accumulate only in the more mature sections of their axons, the parallel fibers. In conclusion: Tau mRNAs are transcribed in the migrating cells several days before <b>Tau</b> <b>proteins</b> are actively translated and transported to their axons. <b>Tau</b> <b>proteins</b> accumulation occurs only at the end of granule cell migration i. e. when the parallel fibers interact with their post-synaptic counterparts, the dendrites of the Purkinje cells.
