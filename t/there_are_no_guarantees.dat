5000|$|Instruction-level preemption. In {{graphics}} tasks, {{the driver}} restricts this to pixel-level preemption because pixel tasks typically finish quickly and the overhead costs of doing pixel-level preemption are {{much lower than}} performing instruction-level preemption. Compute tasks get either thread-level or instruction-level preemption. Instruction-level preemption is useful because compute tasks can take long times to finish and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> on when a compute task finishes, so the driver enables the very expensive instruction-level preemption for these tasks.|$|E
