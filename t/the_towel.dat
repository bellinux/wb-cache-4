5|$|The next {{match was}} the {{submission}} match between champion Bret Hart and challenger Bob Backlund, with the aforementioned stipulation {{being that the}} only way to win the match was to have the opposing cornerman (either Owen Hart or Davey Boy Smith) throw in <b>the</b> <b>towel.</b> Bret got the early advantage and wore down Backlund using head locks, but Backlund broke free and attempted a crossface chickenwing on Bret. Bret escaped, but Backlund maintained the advantage by attacking Bret's arm and attempting another crossface chickenwing. Bret used a figure four leglock on Backlund, but Backlund got out of the hold. Bret then applied the Sharpshooter, his signature hold, on Backlund. Owen entered the ring and clotheslined Bret from behind, causing him to break the hold, and exited the ring. Smith then chased Owen around the ring, but fell and was kayfabe knocked unconscious on the ring steps. While Bret was distracted, Backlund applied the crossface chickenwing. Owen looked on in disbelief at what was happening to Bret and went to the ringside area, where their parents Stu and Helen Hart were sitting. Owen begged them to throw Bret's towel in to the ring to save him as Backlund kept the hold locked in for what would eventually total nine and a half minutes. Stu refused to do so, not trusting Owen's motives, but Helen overruled him and tossed <b>the</b> <b>towel</b> into the ring. Owen then ran into the ring and showed the referee Bret's towel, and the match and championship were awarded to Backlund as Owen took off backstage holding <b>the</b> <b>towel</b> over his head triumphantly, saying later that this Thanksgiving would be the best ever due to him having finally cost Bret the WWF World Heavyweight Championship after trying and failing to do so himself.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Cope {{retired after}} 35 {{years as the}} Steelers radio announcer—the longest tenure of any {{broadcaster}} with a single team in NFL history. Cope was honored by the Steelers {{with the release of}} a limited special edition Towel, featuring his name and catch phrases. Cope was made an honorary co-captain for the Steelers for a Monday night game against the Baltimore Ravens. Cope led the fans in a towel wave at half time; <b>the</b> <b>Towel</b> that Cope used is now in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|After the Holland fight, Dyer {{made several}} {{attempts}} at a rematch with Darcy, reportedly {{to the exclusion}} of other fights, in the belief that the encounter would draw a big crowd and a large purse. The postponed fight with Delmen was again mooted, but this too never occurred. In the meantime Dyer continued to busy himself with charity work, setting up a boxing fund for injured soldiers in Sydney, and continued to tour the vaudeville circuit in New South Wales. Dyer's persistence eventually paid off, and an encounter with Darcy was arranged for 9 October at Rushcutters Bay Stadium, with the Middleweight Championship title at stake. The fight was a one-sided affair, with Dyer outclassed throughout. Although Darcy was warned for a low blow in the fourth round, Dyer was never in the fight and his corner threw in <b>the</b> <b>towel</b> after one minute of the sixth round.|$|E

5|$|In his welterweight debut and {{his first}} fight under Team Rough House affiliation, Wallhead was victorious. The fight took place at Cage Warriors: Strike Force 3 where Wallhead faced Greco-Roman wrestler Steve Singh-Sidhu. Though Wallhead had dropped to welterweight, {{he still had a}} {{considerable}} weight advantage over his opponent who weighed in at 3.5kg less than Wallhead. This perhaps was significant as Singh-Sidhu's strikes seemed to have little bearing on Wallhead, who was able to land takedowns and a standing choke. Midway through the first round, Singh-Sidhu appeared to be backing away from Wallhead, who chased him down with punches and knees to the head. After a shin strike to the head, Singh-Sidhu's corner threw in <b>the</b> <b>towel,</b> resulting in a first-round TKO victory for Wallhead.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} Wrestle Kingdom 11, Omega looked for {{another shot at}} the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, but his plan of obtaining one through the 2017 New Japan Cup was derailed, when he was eliminated in his first round match by Tomohiro Ishii. After defeating Ishii in a rematch on May 3 at Wrestling Dontaku 2017, Omega was nominated by Kazuchika Okada for an IWGP Heavyweight Championship rematch at Dominion 6.11 in Osaka-jo Hall. On June 11 at Dominion 6.11 in Osaka-jo Hall, The Young Bucks defeated Roppongi Vice to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship for the sixth time. Later that same event, Guerrillas of Destiny defeated War Machine (Hanson and Raymond Rowe) to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship for the third time. In the main event of the show, Omega and Okada wrestled to a 60-minute time limit draw for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. The match also started a storyline, where Omega and Cody began having problems with each other with Cody wanting to throw in <b>the</b> <b>towel</b> for Omega, insisting he was too badly injured. On June 23 at Best in the World, Cody defeated Christopher Daniels to bring the ROH World Championship back to Bullet Club. On July 1, during {{the first night of}} G1 Special in USA, Guerrillas of Destiny lost the IWGP Tag Team Championship back to War Machine in a no disqualification match. In the main event of the show, Cody unsuccessfully challenged Okada for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Omega, playing off what had happened at Dominion, walked out, wanting to throw in <b>the</b> <b>towel</b> for Cody, which led to Cody confronting him after the show. The following day, Omega defeated Tomohiro Ishii in the finals of an eight-man tournament to become the inaugural IWGP United States Heavyweight Champion.|$|E
5|$|Most men {{typically}} just wear <b>the</b> <b>towel</b> provided. According to bathhouse etiquette, it {{is perfectly}} acceptable, even friendly, to put one's hand under someone else's towel to feel his penis, which, if well received, {{is the first step}} in sexual intimacy. Some bathhouses permit and others not only permit but encourage total nudity. In some bathhouses nudity is forbidden in the common areas of the establishments. Some men may wear underwear or fetish-wear, but it is unusual for customers to remain fully or even partially dressed in street clothes. Bare feet are customary, though some men prefer to wear flip flops or sandals, sometimes provided by the establishment, for foot protection. The room or locker key is usually suspended from an elastic band which can be worn around the wrist or ankle.|$|E

The rivalry continued at Against All Odds, where Daniels, Joe, and Styles competed in a Three Way {{match for the}} TNA X Division Championship; Joe gained the pinfall to retain the title.

Homer decides to fight back, but misses completely. As Tatum readies himself to deliver the final blow, Moe flies in using the Fan Man's paramotor and carries Homer away. Outside the arena, Marge thanks Moe for saving Homer and Tatum shows respect for the love Moe showed for Homer. Sweet declares that Moe will always be a loser, but still gives him a check for $100,000. Moe starts up the paramotor and flies off into the night.|$|E

5|$|On July 26, 2008, at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Cotto {{suffered}} {{his first}} loss {{as a professional}} to Antonio Margarito in an unsuccessful title defense. Cotto had taken the early initiative, frequently landing a series of punches on Margarito during the early rounds while using his footwork to avoid danger. However, Margarito presented constant offensive pressure of Cotto and eventually began to wear down Cotto's resistance by trapping him against the ropes. Cotto was hurt in the seventh round after a pair of Margarito uppercuts caused his nose to bleed. Margarito continued to chase his opponent down and inflicted further damage {{towards the end of}} the tenth round. Margarito then threw a series of punches at the start of the eleventh round, with Cotto against the ropes and bleeding profusely. A combination from Margarito finally forced Cotto to his knee. He got up, but Margarito continued landing combinations. Evangelista Cotto threw in <b>the</b> <b>towel</b> after Cotto again fell to the canvas in the corner of the ring. Two judges had Margarito ahead by a score of 96–94 at the time of the stoppage, while the third scored the fight even. HBO analyst Harold Lederman had also scored the fight even. Cotto's loss to Margarito has since come under suspicion due to Margarito's subsequent attempted use of illegal hand-wraps in a fight against Shane Mosley.|$|E
5|$|Samoa Joe {{defended the}} TNA X Division Championship against Christopher Daniels {{in the eighth}} match of the show. Mid-way through the contest, Joe avoided a moonsault by Daniels by casually walking away, a {{trademark}} action of his persona. Daniels earned a near-fall after forcing Joe against the mat with a modified Death Valley Driver {{from the top of}} a padded turnbuckle. Joe followed up with his own near-fall by slamming Daniels back-first against the mat from the turnbuckle with a powerbomb. Daniels then performed his signature Best Moonsault Ever maneuver, gaining another near-fall. Their fight spilled to the ringside area where Joe positioned Daniels' head against the guardrail and kicked it against the rail. This move resulted in Daniels bleeding from the forehead, which Joe targeted {{for the rest of the}} bout. At this time, A.J. Styles came down to the ringside area. Joe performed his signature Muscle Buster maneuver and followed up by attempting to place Daniels in his trademarked Coquina Clutch submission maneuver, which Daniels fought off. Joe then dropped Daniels from the top of a turnbuckle onto a chair and continued to target Daniels' bleeding forehead. With Daniels unconscious in the storyline, A.J. Styles threw in <b>the</b> <b>towel</b> for Daniels to stop the match at 15 minutes and 30 seconds, resulting in Joe being declared the victor.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the sudden}} {{popularity}} of the Terrible Towel, Pittsburgh-area department stores sold out all gold and black hand towels. Because the hand towels were often sold as a set, with matching bath towels, stores were left with un-even sets. In the fall of 1978, Bernard Pollock, divisional marketing manager of Gimbel's Department Store {{came up with the}} idea of putting a Terrible Towel logo on hand towels and sold the idea to Cope. The first Terrible Towels hit the marketplace on December 20, 1978 at $6 apiece. Gimbel's could not stock them fast enough. Gimbel's has since gone out of business. The original version of The Terrible Towel was manufactured by Fieldcrest and distributed by St. Mary's Inc. of New York and was available in two colors: Gold and Black. The current manufacturer of <b>the</b> <b>Towel</b> is Little Earth Productions, Inc. of Pittsburgh, who took over from McArthur Towel & Sports Co. of Baraboo, Wisconsin in 2013. The current cost of a towel is approximately $12 (in May, 2017, at Steelers' online store).|$|E

5|$|While Margarito did not land {{a lot of}} punches, he {{remained}} the more engaged fighter in the sixth round. A left hook to the body had Cotto on the defensive early in the seventh round, but {{he was able to}} fend off additional difficulty. A right hand from Cotto slowed Margarito, but he returned with punches that forced Cotto to clinch. Margarito commanded the bulk of the round, throwing 130punches in the round according to Compubox. Cotto was advocated by his corner in between rounds to stay off the ropes. He obliged, providing lateral movement throughout the round but with approximately 30seconds left, Margarito was able to trap Cotto in a corner, but Cotto managed to escape. It was more of the same in the ninth round, with Cotto going back and forth between southpaw and conventional stance. Margarito continued charging ahead, although Cotto would counterpunch sufficiency to avoid Margarito. The same pattern applied as in the previous two rounds, with Margarito charging forward and Cotto using movement while anticipating chances to counterpunch. Margarito immediately concluded the gap in the final 15seconds, landing a left hook, left uppercut and right hand that had Cotto against the ropes. Halfway through the eleventh round, a left uppercut by Margarito left Cotto vulnerable as he took a knee after Margarito landed a right uppercut and two right hands. Cotto managed to get up, but he went down again, despite Margarito not landing another punch. The referee moved in to count, but Evangelista Cotto, Cotto's trainer and uncle, climbed onto the ring apron and threw in <b>the</b> <b>towel.</b> The official time of the stoppage was 2:05of round eleven.|$|E
