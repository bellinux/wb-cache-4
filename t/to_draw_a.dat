5|$|Archaeological, biogeographical, and {{linguistic}} evidence {{suggest that the}} donkey was first domesticated by nomadic pastoral people in North Africa over 5,000 years ago. The animals were used to help cope with the increased aridity of the Sahara and the Horn of Africa. Genetic evidence finds that the donkey was domesticated twice based on two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. It also points to a single ancestor, the Nubian wild ass. Attempts to domesticate zebras were largely unsuccessful, though Walter Rothschild trained some <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> carriage in England.|$|E

5|$|At the beginning, Lasker {{tried to}} attack but Schlechter had no {{difficulty}} defending, {{so that the}} first four games finished in draws. In the fifth game Lasker had a big advantage, but committed a blunder that cost him the game. Hence at {{the middle of the}} match Schlechter was one point ahead. The next four games were drawn, despite fierce play from both players. In the sixth Schlechter managed <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> game being a pawn down. In the seventh Lasker nearly lost because of a beautiful exchange sacrifice from Schlechter. In the ninth only a blunder from Lasker allowed Schlechter <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> lost ending. The score before the last game was thus 5–4 for Schlechter. In the tenth game Schlechter tried to win tactically and took a big advantage, but he missed a clear win at the 35th move, continued to take increasing risks and finished by losing. Hence the match was a draw and Lasker remained World Champion.|$|E
5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year passed without a {{military}} campaign. Soldiers were {{a normal part}} of everyday life, much more so than in modern Western societies. While it is difficult <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it is easier to do so in terms of their social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.|$|E

The Sugar Bowl picked Ohio State, which left the Orange Bowl to decide between two teams contractually bound to appear in a BCS bowl game. These were Stanford, which was guaranteed a BCS bid by its No. 4 national ranking, and Connecticut, champion of the Big East Conference. Favoring Stanford's potential <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> large television audience, the Orange Bowl selected the Cardinal, leaving Connecticut to the Fiesta Bowl.|$|E

Still others try to develop methods, pharmacologic or otherwise, of enhancing LTP to improve learning and memory. LTP is also a subject of clinical research, for example, {{in the areas of}} Alzheimer's disease and addiction medicine.|$|E
5|$|Peake again painted Henry {{outdoors}} in about 1610. In this portrait, {{now at the}} Royal Palace of Turin, the prince looks hardly older than in the 1603 double portrait; but his left foot rests on a shield bearing the three-feathers device of the Prince of Wales, a title he did not hold until 1610. Henry is portrayed {{as a young man}} of action, about <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> jewel-encrusted sword from its scabbard. The portrait was almost certainly sent to Savoy in connection with a marriage proposed in January 1611 between Henry and the Infanta Maria, daughter of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy.|$|E

5|$|The {{architect}} Jean-Nicolas Huyot gave {{very precise}} instructions to this section.

5|$|The {{first step}} is to mark two {{arbitrary}} points of the plane (which will eventually become vertices of the triangle), and use the compass <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> circle centered at one of the marked points, through the other marked point. Next, one draws a second circle, of the same radius, centered at the other marked point and passing through the first marked point.|$|E

The man, Mochtar, a Javanese of noble descent, was told to use the title Raden for the film, which {{he and his family}} had already abandoned.

5|$|Bleach {{was first}} {{conceived}} from Tite Kubo's desire <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> shinigami in a kimono, which {{formed the basis}} for the design of the Soul Reapers. Because of this, Kuchiki {{was one of the first}} characters of the series to be created. Before deciding that every Soul Reaper had swords, Kubo thought that they all should use guns, while only Rukia used a scythe. However, this was changed as he created the Soul Reaper kimono. Kubo also mentioned that Rukia did not seem like a lead character, so he created Ichigo Kurosaki to be the series protagonist. Ichigo's initial design had black hair like Rukia; Kubo had to modify Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair and a trademark scowl.|$|E

50|$|Ellipses {{appear in}} {{descriptive}} geometry as images (parallel or central projection) of circles (for details: see Ellipses in DG (German)). So {{it is essential}} to have tools <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>an</b> ellipse. Nowadays the best tool is the computer. During the times before this tool was not available and one was restricted to compass and ruler for the construction of single points of an ellipse. But there are technical tools (ellipsographs) <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>an</b> ellipse in a continuous way like <b>a</b> compass for <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> circle, too.

When Leslie reluctantly agrees to do so, Jerry expresses disappointment that she would give up so easily. Feeling empowered again, Leslie asks Jerry to quickly paint another, similar painting, only this time with Tom as the centaur. Leslie tells Marcia the new painting is the original one but painted over. With no more nudity in the painting, a frustrated Marcia gives up her quest to have the painting destroyed. Tom is delighted with the painting until he realizes that Jerry forgot <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> penis on the centaur. Ben later confides to Andy he likes Leslie but is unable to ask her out because of Chris, but Andy tells him if they truly care about each other, then it will eventually happen.|$|E
5|$|Despite Toronto's {{improved}} defensive performances, Carter's offence was sorely {{missed in}} the first-round {{series against the}} second-seeded Detroit Pistons. In the first game, Detroit overwhelmed Toronto 83–65, largely due to Ben Wallace's strong performance of 19 points, 20 rebounds, 3 blocks and 3 steals. Detroit also won Game 2, but Toronto won the next two games at home to force a deciding and tightly contested Game 5 in Detroit. With 10.7 {{seconds left in the}} game, and the Raptors down 85–82 with possession of the ball, Childs raced down the court and shot a three-pointer that missed badly, apparently trying <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>a</b> foul on the play, instead of passing to a wide-open Curry. In a post-game locker room interview, Childs repeatedly insisted that the Raptors had been down four points, not three. The Raptors' late-season surge was thus marred by a disappointing playoff exit; the Olajuwon experiment was also a bust, with the 39-year-old averaging career lows in minutes, points and rebounds. Furthermore, Childs, Clark and Curry left the team, ensuring a new-look team for the next season.|$|E
