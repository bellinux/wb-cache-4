5|$|Early {{drafts of}} Barret's {{background}} featured subtle differences, such as Marlene intended as Barret's biological daughter, {{and his wife}} executed {{in front of him}} by a then-undecided Shinra executive. The attack on Corel was initially written to be due to the discovery of Mako energy and Shinra's desire to keep its existence a secret. His reunion with Dyne was also different, written to culminate in a duel between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> Corel's ruins, while Cloud and the others fought investigating Shinra soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Garza, {{troubled by}} what he had done, confessed to the police that he acted as a {{middleman}} in Fischer's murder. He cooperated with the police to incriminate Martínez, who then aided in Cisneros' arrest. Cisneros and Garza were eventually {{sentenced to life in}} prison by a state court in 1994, but Cisneros' sentence was overturned due to a legal technicality. She was convicted again in 1998 by a federal court and {{sentenced to life in prison}}. Martínez was given a 20-year sentence after pleading guilty and testifying against <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> court. Though U.S. officials tried to have the two assassins extradited, the hitmen never faced trial in Texas. They were prosecuted in Mexico and given a 15-year sentence.|$|E

Hardy also became {{the first man to}} defeat Mr. Kennedy in singles' competition. On July 25, after the SmackDown! taping, Hardy was taken out of action after doctors found the remnants of the staph infection that had plagued him the previous year. He was sidelined until August 25 while he healed. Hardy made a surprise appearance backstage at Unforgiven after Jeff's match against Johnny Nitro.

5|$|In 1880, {{the diamond}} {{stingray}} was described twice by three American ichthyologists: as Dasybatus dipterurus by David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert in Proceedings of the United States National Museum, and as Trygon brevis by Samuel Garman in Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. Jordan and Gilbert's account {{was published in}} May while Garman's was published in October, making dipterurus (feminine dipterura) the correct name as it was published first. However, when Garman synonymized <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> 1913 he inappropriately gave precedence to brevis, leading to long-standing confusion. Both Dasybatus and Trygon were later synonymized with the genus Dasyatis, but many authors still listed D.brevis in place of or in addition to D.dipterura. Garman also synonymized the Hawaiian stingray (D.hawaiensis) with D.dipterura in 1913, which has since been followed by most authors but requires more study for confirmation.|$|E
5|$|In September York {{arrived from}} Ireland, {{and at the}} {{parliament}} of October that year, the duke {{walked up to the}} throne and put his hand on it. The act, signifying usurpation, left the assembly in shock. It is unclear whether Warwick had prior knowledge of York's plans, though it is assumed that this had been agreed upon between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> Ireland the previous March. It soon became clear, however, that this regime change was unacceptable to the lords in parliament, and a compromise was agreed. The Act of Accord of 31October 1460 stated that while Henry VI was allowed to stay on the throne for the remainder of his life, his son Edward, Prince of Wales, was to be disinherited. Instead, York would succeed the king, and act as protector.|$|E

5|$|In the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, both Spanish and Catalan were {{official}} {{languages of}} the games, {{but due to}} the political sensitivity surrounding the use of Catalan, the nations entered in French alphabetical order.

In the 2008 Summer Olympics, teams were ordered {{by the number of}} strokes in the Chinese translation of the team name. In the 2010 Winter Olympics, teams entered in English alphabetical order, although the languages of the Olympics are also the languages of the host country, Canada, because English is the more dominant of <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> Vancouver and in the host province of British Columbia.

5|$|Indium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolIn and atomic number 49. It is a post-transition metal {{that makes up}} 0.21parts per million of the Earth's crust. Very soft and malleable, indium has a melting point higher than sodium and gallium, but lower than lithium and tin. Chemically, indium is similar to gallium and thallium, and it is largely intermediate between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> terms of its properties. Indium was discovered in 1863 by Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter by spectroscopic methods. They named it for the indigo blue line in its spectrum. Indium was isolated the next year.|$|E

5|$|Skanderbeg's {{primary reason}} for allying with Alfonso was his fear of 21-year-old Mehmed II, whose {{ambition}} was to reconquer Justinian I's empire which stretched from Syria to Spain. Mehmed had been planning a campaign against Albania since Skanderbeg had defeated his father at Krujë in 1450. Another factor was that Krujë geographically dominated Durazzo, which was only 150 kilometers from Brindisi, the nearest Italian port. Mehmed's ambitions were symmetrical to Alfonso's {{and it was clear}} that there would be some sort of clash between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> Albania, the epicenter of the conflict. Mehmed {{was one of the first}} monarchs since Roman times to keep a massive centralized army under his personal control. Besides controlling a huge army, Mehmed was widely acknowledged for his far-reaching wisdom which allowed him to produce a highly advanced military armed with the newest models of the cannon.|$|E

After Lesnar claimed in a {{backstage}} interview that he could beat anybody in the world, Goldberg interrupted the interview and introduced himself to Lesnar, shaking hands with him before leaving with a staredown. Lesnar followed this rivalry with a feud involving Hardcore Holly. In the storyline, Holly wanted revenge on Lesnar for legitimately injuring his neck during a previous match between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> 2002 which left Holly in need of neck surgery and out of action for a year. At the Royal Rumble on January 25, 2004, Lesnar defeated Holly to retain the WWE Championship.

5|$|The {{game has}} been called both a {{platform}} game and an action-adventure game.

The game features both single- and two-player modes; in both, players control {{one of the three}} protagonists. ToeJam moves quickly and jumps high, but has weak attacks; Earl is tougher and has more powerful attacks, but is slow and jumps lower than ToeJam; Latisha ranks between <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>in</b> terms of athleticism, and gains additional power-ups later in the game. In the game's two-player mode, the camera moves between single and split-screen as players maneuver their characters away from each other. Characters can share power-ups when in close proximity.|$|E
