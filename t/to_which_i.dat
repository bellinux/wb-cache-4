500|$|Victoria and Ernst proved incompatible. Victoria despaired of her husband's lack {{of affection}} towards her, while Ernst devoted {{much of his}} {{attention}} to their daughter, whom he adored. Elisabeth, who physically resembled her mother, preferred the company of her father to Victoria. Ernst and Victoria both enjoyed entertaining and frequently held house parties for young friends. Their unwritten rule was that anyone over thirty [...] "was old and out." [...] Formality was dispensed with and royal house guests were referred to by their nicknames and encouraged to do as they wished.

500|$|During World War I (1914–1918), {{nearing the}} age of 50, Gandhi {{supported}} the British and its allied forces by recruiting Indians to join the British army, expanding the Indian contingent from about 100,000 to over 1.1million. He encouraged his people to fight {{on one side of}} the war in Europe and Africa at the cost of their lives. Pacifists criticised and questioned Gandhi, who defended these practices by stating, according to Sankar Ghose, [...] "it would be madness for me to sever my connection with the society <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> belong". According to Keith Robbins, the recruitment effort was in part motivated by the British promise to reciprocate the help with swaraj (self-government) to Indians after the end of World War I. After the war, the British government offered minor reforms instead, which disappointed Gandhi. He launched his satyagraha movement in 1919. In parallel, Gandhi's fellowmen became sceptical of his pacifist ideas and were inspired by the ideas of nationalism and anti-imperialism.|$|E

As the English anecdotist William Seward put it in 1798, [...] "Courtesy, no less than courage, was always the appenage {{of the family of}} Crillon". During the siege of Gibraltar, he sent his English opponent General George Eliott a gift of fruits, vegetables and game, along with some ice, which he presumed [...] "will not be disagreeable in the excessive heat of this climate at this season of the year." [...] He expressed his [...] "pleasure <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> look forward of becoming your friend, after I shall have learned to render myself worthy of the honour, by facing you as an enemy."

500|$|Wilde spent mid-1897 with Robert Ross in {{the seaside}} village of Berneval-le-Grand in {{northern}} France, where he wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol, narrating {{the execution of}} Charles Thomas Wooldridge, who murdered his wife in a rage at her infidelity; it moves from an objective story-telling to symbolic identification with the prisoners as a whole. No attempt is made to assess the justice of the laws which convicted them, but rather the poem highlights the brutalisation of the punishment that all convicts share. Wilde juxtaposes the executed man and himself with the line [...] "Yet each man kills the thing he loves". Wilde too was separated from his wife and sons. He adopted the proletarian ballad form, and the author was credited as [...] "C33", Wilde's cell number in Reading Gaol. He suggested that it be published in Reynolds' Magazine, [...] "because it circulates widely among the criminal classes– <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> now belong– for once I will be read by my peers– a new experience for me". It was an immediate roaring commercial success, going through seven editions {{in less than two}} years, only after which [...] "" [...] was added to the title page, though many in literary circles had known Wilde to be the author. It brought him a little money.|$|E
500|$|The {{plans for}} the {{invasion}} of Borneo evolved considerably during April. Initially, the offensive was to commence on 23 April with the landing of a brigade from the 6th Division {{on the island of}} Tarakan, off the east coast of Borneo. The 9th Division would then assault Balikpapan followed by Banjarmasin in south-east Borneo. These positions would be used to support the invasion of Java by the remainder of I Corps. After the attack on Java was cancelled, it was decided to employ two brigades of the 7th Division at Brunei Bay, and I Corps conducted further preparations on this basis. However, on 17 April General Douglas MacArthur's General Headquarters (<b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>I</b> Corps reported) swapped the roles of the 7th and 9th Divisions. Accordingly, the final plan for the attack against Borneo specified that one of the 9th Division's brigades would land on Tarakan island on 29 April (later postponed to 1 May), with the remainder of the division to invade the Brunei Bay area on 23 May. The 7th Division was scheduled to [...] assault Balikpapan on 1 July. The Borneo campaign was designated the [...] "Oboe" [...] phase of the Allied offensive through the southern Philippines towards the Netherlands East Indies, and the landings at Tarakan, Brunei Bay and Balikpapan were designated Operations Oboe One, Six and Two respectively.|$|E
