Among those included were {{the sons and daughters of}} the king of Bimbia who gathered significant slaves and ivory to pay for their release, but the British captain would not release them and sailed away. As a result, the locals panyarred two other British ships in retaliation until a Dutch ship captured the British ship and returned to Bimbia with the persons held on the ship. Throughout the coast, Europeans and Africans participated in panyarring more rarely until it became nonexistent in the early 20th century.|$|R
25|$|The limes {{was never}} able to prevent whole Germanic tribes from {{entering}} the territory of the Roman Empire. This was not the intention of the builders. Near the watch towers, the limes was open to passage, especially by <b>traders</b> or <b>persons</b> coming to live or work within the Empire, the purpose of the limes was control of this traffic. To cross the limes it was necessary to pass the towers, and so come to the notice of the garrison, or try to climb or destroy the wall and the stakes. Only individuals or small groups could climb the obstacles without being noticed, and they could not drive much stolen livestock with them. Large groups would be noticed, they could destroy one or several towers, but this also would come {{to the attention of the}} Romans. This knowledge of all traffic crossing the border was crucial to the Roman military. For a territory as large as the Roman Empire, there were amazingly few soldiers, almost all of the legions were based close to the frontiers, any hostile band that managed to pass this outer area of defense could travel within the Empire without much resistance. The purpose of the limes was as an early warning system, deterrence of casual small-scale raiding, and the ability to counteract while the enemy was still near the border fortresses and garrisons. Other researchers believe the limes may have been a bulwark to prevent illegal immigration, comparing it to the fence system along the American-Mexican border.|$|R
50|$|VAT {{taxation}} under Bulgarian tax law {{is regulated}} by Value Added Tax Act (VATA) (Bulg: Закон за данък върху добавената стойност), the Regulation for the Application of VATA (RAVATA) and Directive 2006/112 -COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 {{on the common}} system of value added tax.This type of indirect tax is payable monthly for all supplies of goods or services for any intra-European Union acquisition whose place of performance is within the country, carried out by a registered person, {{as well as for}} importation of goods. VAT is a tax levied on newly created value during the implementation process of goods or services. The tax is levied on the consumption thereof and the group of turnover taxes. The VAT model under Bulgarian law follows the common VAT regime within the EU model, where personal expenses are taxable by applying the credit (invoice) method. According to this method, each stage of production of goods or services and the implementation thereof to end users is chargeable with VAT on the entire value of the supply, such that through the mechanism of tax credit the final price of the goods or services includes a single VAT charge in the amount of the respective tax rate.A taxable person is any person who independently carries out an economic activity, whatever the purpose and results of that activity, as well as any person who performs accidental onerous intra-European Union supplies of new transport vehicles. „Independent economic activity” are the activities of producers, <b>traders</b> and <b>persons</b> supplying services, including mining and agriculture, as well as the practice of a liberal profession, including as private enforcement agents and notaries.|$|R
40|$|Do laws ever {{deepen the}} crime risks facing {{managers}} and auditors? According {{to the literature}} and drawing upon several research traditions—actuarial, opportunity reduction and sectoral vulnerability studies—a provisional approach to assessment is developed and applied. Some headline risk concepts are: incoherence or lack of clarity of legalisation; potential for opening up opportunities for illegal acts by market participants; {{and the extent to}} which legislation might or might not signal to exposed persons that opportunities exist. This approach is deployed briefly in relation to EC directives on business transparency and auditing and, in more detail, in relation to the Enron debacle. The latter very clearly shows how changes in regulation in two distinct sectors, the energy market and securities (financial instruments), produced an excrescence of risk. Whilst some risks may come from regulation/de-regulation that is intended to directly apply to specific roles (e. g., auditing), other risks come from regulation/de-regulation in adjacent policy areas. Assessment has both to cast its net wide and to drill down to detail, looking for risks in the nooks and crannies of economic practices. In reaching such assessments, it would be most appropriate to ask <b>traders,</b> compliance <b>persons,</b> enforcement agents and jurists how they would understand the provisions of and risks implied by legislative proposals. Whilst officials can steer that process, it seems questionable whether the actual authors of legislative proposals should be asked to critically assess those same proposals, so “Chinese Walls” may be required within the European Commission. Finally, there are questions of the limits to assessment in cases when details of implementation have yet to supplied by future measures. EC Regulations, which do not rely upon transposition into national laws, may be easer to assess than Directives...|$|R

500|$|Most {{detrimental}} to Grant's Peace Policy was rampant {{corruption in the}} [...] Department of the Interior under Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano. During Sec. Delano's tenor, federal money intended to supply Native American tribes with food and clothing was skimmed off by corrupt Indian agents and clerks, often allied with <b>traders.</b> In addition, <b>persons</b> posing as [...] "Indian Attorneys" [...] charged Indian tribes money for bogus representation in Washington D.C. After newspapers exposed Delano's delinquency, Grant defended him rather than investigate the matter. Although Sec. Delano supported and defined Grant's Indian peace policy and {{was instrumental in the}} creation of the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation in 1872, he was not a reformer and was careless in his administration of the Department of the Interior. The previous Grant appointment, Secretary Jacob D. Cox, had run the department with efficiency and merit. Cox had been considered to be one of the best secretaries of Interior in the nation's history. [...] When Cox resigned in 1870, Grant appointed Delano out of patronage considerations to appease Stalwart party bosses. After Sec. Delano finally resigned in 1875, his replacement, Sec. Zachariah Chandler, reformed the Department of the Interior, banned [...] "Indian Attornies", and fired the corrupt clerks working in the Department of Indian Affairs. Grant's Secretary of War, William W. Belknap, who was in charge of all Indian Trading posts under the Department of War, received illicit profit payments from the Fort Sill Indian tradership. Sec. Belknap resigned and was replaced by reformer Alphonso Taft. Belknap was impeached by the House; put on trial in the Senate during the Summer of 1876 and acquitted.|$|R
40|$|Any {{preferential}} treatment of income of certain population groups at setting their share on state costs results in harmful disproportions in consequence. Valid taxing conditions of <b>traders</b> and self-employed <b>persons</b> {{for the last}} three years in the Czech Republic, lead to labour market distor- tions. This paper gives evidence of extreme differences in tax burden of various income groups of self-employed persons compared to wage and capital yield taxation. Remarkable disparities are apparent both at lower and medium-high incomes and at peak incomes exceeding CZK 10 million per year. Presented calculations and figures confirm that particularly freelance occupations, consulting services as well as other trading professions are groundlessly favoured. Their bearers can tran- smit real costs on their clients and yet they are eligible to apply lump sum expenses ranging from 40 % to 60 % of income. Thus, they reduce their taxable income as well as basis of assessment for obligatory payments into insurance system in this way. Unlike them, some traders and people in position of employees cannot use such an optimization from practical reasons. This systemic distortion constitutes a groundless differentiation in a share of different citizens on financing of state expenditures. In a broader sense, it might even contradict constitutional order of the Czech Republic. At least, this situation harms significantly a willingness of citizens to take a share in solidarity system of financing state operation and its social system voluntarily. Diverse tax burden imposes a pressure on the labour market or more precisely leads to crow- ding-out of wage earners out of the labour market into the sphere of so called „švarzsystem” (evasion of labour law provisions by a conclusion of a commercial-contractual relationship). Secon- dary, but fundamental result is a distortion of macroeconomic statistics that provide documentary evidence for labour market development...|$|R
