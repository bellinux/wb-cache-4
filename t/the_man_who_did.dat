Sometime between 15 July 1378, and 26 February 1379, Ingram was provided as Bishop of Galloway by Avignon Pope Clement VII {{in opposition to}} the Urbanist candidate Oswald (see Western Schism). This was done because of the influence of Ingram's old university master, Walter de Wardlaw, now Bishop of Glasgow. Ingram however {{does not appear to have}} wanted the bishopric, and found objections to his own provision. As Clement wrote to Thomas de Rossy, <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> <b>did</b> become the Clementine bishop, he had [...] "provided Ingeram, archdeacon of Dunkeld, but he refused to accept his provision".|$|E
