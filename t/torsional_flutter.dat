40|$|The <b>torsional</b> <b>flutter</b> {{oscillations}} of a 4 : 1 rectangular cylinder {{around its}} pitching axis are investigated through wind tunnel experiments and numerical simulations. The rectangle’s responses to different initial conditions and turbulence excitations at various wind tunnel airspeeds are recorded. Timeresolved Particle Image Velocimetry measurements are taken at two different airspeeds, when the rectangle undergoes Limit Cycle Oscillations.

Nondimensional harmonic coefficients were extracted from the free transient vibration tests for amplitudes up to 80 degrees.

Sub- and supercritical bifurcations behaviour has been identified. The dynamics of the system, as well as the aerodynamic phenomena taking place around the model have been measured. The frequency content of the pitching displacement and the longitudinal component of the velocity in the wake showed the occurrence of two types of aerodynamic instability: large separation from the leading edge and vortex shedding in the Strouhal sense.

40|$|The {{study of}} the dynamic {{interactions}} between the wind and civil engineering structures has become increasingly important {{over the last few}} decades. Most of these structures are aerodynamically "bluff" and are becoming more flexible. Bluff-body aeroelasticity is a very challenging research area due to the unsteadiness and nonlinearity of the aerodynamic loading. This thesis presents the investigation of three aeroelastic phenomena affecting bluff-bodies: Vortex Induced Vibration (VIV), Galloping and <b>Torsional</b> <b>Flutter.</b> For each instability, extensive experimental studies are carried out in the wind tunnel. Innovative analysis, based on the Common-base Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (CPOD) method is used to study the flow visualization data. The VIV phenomenon is studied on a flexible tube with a circular cross-section, supported from its midpoint. A CPOD-based input-output model is developed to describe the system. The galloping instability is studied on a generic bridge section. A complete analysis of the aeroelastic behaviour of the structure is presented and a new polynomial empirical model is developed, which reflects accurately the nonlinear nature of the system. The <b>torsional</b> <b>flutter</b> phenomenon is extensively studied for two different structures: a generic bridge deck and a rectangular cylinder. The Motion Induced Vortex is identified as the fundamental cause of this aeroelastic phenomenon, {{on the basis of the}} analysis of the flow around the oscillating rectangle. In addition, it is demonstrated that the quasi-steady theory is not adapted to estimate the onset velocity of <b>torsional</b> <b>flutter.</b> Finally, a 2 D aeroelastic simulation code, based on the Discrete Vortex Method (DVM) is developed. The non-linear aerodynamics around the body are well reproduced, allowing the simulation of all the aeroelastic instabilities investigated experimentally...|$|E

A model wing was oscillated in pitch at several small amplitudes over a wide and representative range of conditions. Unsteady surface pressures were measured and integrated to determine the aerodynamic damping at five spanwise stations. Strong negative damping was found for motions centered near static stall for all studied reduced frequencies, Mach numbers, and sweep angles. The 30 -deg sweptback configuration was found to become negatively damped over the entire span nearly simultaneously, while the unswept model exhibited local regions of negative damping that moved toward the wing tip as the mean angle of attack was increased...|$|R
40|$|<b>Torsional</b> Stall <b>Flutter</b> (TSF) is a {{one degree}} of freedom, {{self-excited}} phenomenon {{induced by the}} periodic separation/re-attachment of the flow around a body. The present paper proposes an experimental investigation of TSF on a bridge deck. A section model free to oscillate in torsion is tested in a low-speed wind tunnel. Static and dynamic tests are performed to enable a complete interpretation of the phenomena involved. For low airspeeds, the Karman vortex shedding excites the structure, resulting in small oscillations at the vortex shedding frequency. For high airspeeds, the deck undergoes Limit Cycle Oscillations (LCO) due to the TSF phenomenon. Nevertheless the Karman vortex shedding excitation is still present and appears in the measured forces signals. Peaks and troughs in the lift coefficient are detected for each pitching period. They are interpreted as the separation/re-attachment of the flow around the deck. The large amplitudes motion of the deck undergoing TSF reduces the amplitude of the aerodynamic lift coefficient...|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} {{occurrence of}} internal parametric resonance phenomena has been recently in-dicated {{as a possible}} cause of failure for long-span suspension bridges. At the same time, suspension bridges, in view of their flexibility, are prone to aeroelasticity driven response, such as vortex shedding, <b>torsional</b> divergence and <b>flutter.</b> In this paper, a non-linear dynamic model of a suspension bridge is devised, {{with the purpose of}} providing a unified framework for the study of aeroelastic and internal resonance instabilities. Inspired by the pioneering work of Herrmann and Hauger, the analyses have been based on a linearized formulation that is able to represent the main structural non-linear effects and the coupling given by aer-odynamic forces.

40|$|The report {{presents}} the results of calculations of <b>torsional</b> <b>flutter</b> of unstalled cascade blades at zero mean deflection and subsonic Mach numbers. Three kinds of flutter are found. Subcritical flutter occurs when no acoustic waves Can propagate in the duct. The effect of increasing Mach number is highly favourable, and tends to suppress the flutter predicted by incompressible theory. Acoustic resonance flutter occurs when the blade frequency is very slightly less than the acoustic resonant frequency of the upstream and downstream ducts. It is critically dependent on this coincidence, and would give very small areas of flutter on a compressor performance map. Supercritical flutter occurs when some acoustic waves can propagate in the duct. It only occurs at Mach numbers close to unity, and is probably not of much practical importance...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} sweep on fan blade flutter is studied by {{applying}} the analytical methods developed for aeroelastic analysis of advance turboprops. Two methods are used. The first method utilizes an approximate structural model in which the blade is represented by a swept, nonuniform beam. The second method utilizes a finite element technique to conduct modal flutter analysis. For both methods the unsteady aerodynamic loads are calculated using two dimensional cascade theories which are modified to account for sweep. An advanced fan stage is analyzed with 0, 15 and 30 degrees of sweep. It is shown that sweep has a beneficial effect on predominantly <b>torsional</b> <b>flutter</b> and a detrimental effect on predominantly bending flutter.

A good general agreement has been found with both experimental and numerical data reported in the literature. This highlights the benefits of this relatively simple and straightforward approach.

40|$|The report {{presents}} the results of theoretical calculations of <b>torsional</b> <b>flutter</b> of unstalled cascade blades. It is shown that the position of the torsional axis is of great importance, the best position being near the quarter-chord point, and the worst position near the threequarter-chord point. An unfavourable axis position gives flutter speeds which are exceeded in normal machines. An experimental investigation in an annular cascade with twelve blades confirms the existence of this type of flutter. Good agreement with the theory is found in some cases, but in others it is thought that threedimensional effects are having a substantial influence. The effects of small differences between blades are examined theoretically in an Appendix, and it is concluded that the effects of mistuning and mechanical damping are always favourable. 1. Introduction. It has been well established that for normal designs of axial compressor and turbine blading the aerodynamic forces do not have an appreciable effect on the modes of vibration of the blades. This is because the mass of the blade is much greater than the mass of fluid in its immediate vicinity.

40|$|An {{analytical}} {{technique for}} {{the prediction of}} fan blade flutter was evaluated by utilizing first stage fan flutter data from tests on an advanced high performance engine. The formulation includes both aerodynamic and mechanical coupling among all the blades of the assembly. Mistuning is accounted for in the analysis so that individual blade inertias, frequencies, or damping can be considered. Airfoil stability was predicted by calculating a flutter determinant, the eigenvalues of which indicate the extent of susceptibility to flutter. When blade to blade differences in frequencies are considered, a stable system is predicted for the test points examined. For a tuned system, {{it was found that}} <b>torsional</b> <b>flutter</b> can be predicted at a limited number of interblade phase angles. Examination of these phase angles indicated that they were "close" to the condition of acoustic resonance. For the range of Mach numbers and reduced frequencies considered, the so called subcritical flutter cannot be predicted. The essential influence of mechanical coupling among the blades is to change the frequencies of the system with little or no change in damping; however, aerodynamic coupling together with mechanical coupling could change not only frequencies, but also damping in the system, with a trend toward instability...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{aerodynamics}} {{of simple}} geometries {{such as the}} circle, the square and the rec-tangle is of interest for both fundamental research and practical applications {{in many areas of}} Engineering. In particular, rectangular cylinders have received large attention {{due to the fact that}} they offer a broad range of types of aerodynamic and aeroelastic behaviour, depend-ing on the aspect ratio. A wide variety of results of wind tunnel measurements and of CFD analyses are available in the literature. In this paper some features of the aerodynamics of a 5 : 1 rectangular cylinder are presented, as obtained from wind tunnel pressure measurements, through comparison between the case in which the cylinder is located in a smooth flow and the case in which it is located in a turbulent flow. In addition, in the case of an oncoming smooth flow, the aerodynamics of the cylinder vibrating in a <b>torsional</b> <b>flutter</b> mode is consid-ered, and compared to that of the stationary cylinder. The sectional distribution of the statis-tics of the pressure coefficients (mean, RMS, skewness and kurtosis) have been analysed, together with Probability Density Functions and the Power Spectra of the pressure fluctua-tions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical method {{based on a}} LES approach to modelling the unsteady flow around and the vortex-induced vibration (VIV) of a 5 : 1 rectangular cylinder in the smooth and turbulent flow. A fluid-structure interaction algorithm was also developed to model the aerodynamic behaviour of a half of the bridge deck in the bending and torsional modes. Results from the static and heaving simulations have validated {{the accuracy of the}} proposed computational method and revealed the important role of the motion-induced vortex during the lock-in and its interaction with the von Karman vortex. By introducing the bending motion on the bridge deck, some preliminary results of the bending simulation have indicated some distinct features including the variation of the surface pressure and the separation bubble in the spanwise direction which could promote the spanwise flow. The relative strength between the motion-induced vortex and the von Karman vortex was observed to vary across the spanwise length of the bridge deck, largely influencing the response of the bridge deck in the lock-in. The project will go on to investigate these features together with the surface pressure distribution and the pressure coherence and correlation structure in order to offer a quantitative explanation on the turbulence-induced effect on the VIV and <b>torsional</b> <b>flutter</b> of a 5 : 1 rectangular cylinder...|$|E
40|$|The report gives {{particulars}} of {{a method of}} calculation, which has been programmed for a digital computer, for linearized two-dimensional subsonic unsteady flow through a cascade of flat plates operating at zero mean incidence. Inputs to the calculation are motion of the blades due to either bending or torsional vibration, wakes from moving obstructions upstream of the cascade, and incoming acoustic waves. For each of these inputs the output gives the force and moment on the blades, the wakes shed from the trailing edges, and the outgoing acoustic waves. The program therefore provides all the information necessary for calculation of forced and self-excited vibration of the blades, and for the generation, transmission, and reflection of acoustic waves by a cascade. Two kinds of acoustic resonance are found, one corresponding to resonance of an annular duct without blades, and the other being an acoustic resonance in the passages between the blades. Results are presented which illustrate the generation of acoustic waves by wakes.

40|$|Based on the {{aerodynamic}} {{interaction between}} the heaving vortex-induced vibration and the <b>torsional</b> <b>flutter,</b> another explanation of the drastic change of the vibrational mode from the 5 th symmetrical heaving mode to the 1 st asymmetrical torsional mode is introduced. Some fundamental characteristics of the coupled flutter of a thin plate and a plate like structure, such as the flutter modes, the flutter branches, are explained by use of the “Step-by-Step flutter analysis”. The flutter properties obtained by the 3 DOF multi-modes-flutter analysis are compared with the ones by the 2 DOF 2 modes- flutter analysis t. 3 DOF multi-modes flutter analysis is recommended to use for more accurate verification of the flutter property as the lessons from the aerodynamic behavior of the full-scale elastic model of Akashi Kaikyo Bridge. The reduction of the key equivalent aerodynamic derivatives, by suitable span-wise arrangement of the girders with different girder-shapes, is significantly effective to stabilize the flutter instability of a long spanned suspension bridge. Furthermore, the significantly similar formula with the Selberg formula can be derived under the simple assumptions. As an application of the coupled flutter, the generation mechanism of the propulsion force by use of coupled flutter motion is introduced.

40|$|Turbulent flows around slender {{structures}} {{are common in}} nature and occur in many applications, including flows around tall buildings and long-span bridges. Understanding and predicting the properties of these flows are necessary for a safe, effective and economical engineering design. Experimental techniques are expensive and often provide data that is not sufficiently detailed for the structural engineer. With increasing computational power it has become possible to investigate these flows using numerical techniques. A number of numerical approaches have been proposed over the last half century. Of these, {{one of the most}} effective techniques, that is currently on the verge of being viable for common use in industry, is that of Large-Eddy Simulation (LES). This thesis illustrates the appealing aspects of LES for the use in wind engineering. Measurement of forces on a bluff body placed in a flow is of considerable importance to the wind engineer. It is well established in the literature that the peak pressures on the body are due to large coherent structures in the flow, denoted vortices. The atmospheric boundary layer, in which all civil engineering {{structures are}} situated, is almost always turbulent, and it has a strong influence on vortex formation. In the present work, to generate in flow turbulence for LES, a synthetic in flow condition was utilised to analyse the effects of freestream turbulence over the CAARC standard tall model building. With the use of pressure statistics and conditional sampling, the sensitivity of the peak loading to the freestream turbulence effects were analysed, showing a marked increase for both turbulence intensity and length scale of the flow. The formation of vortices over a long-span bridges can incur severe aeroelastic instabilities. A fluid-structure coupling method was proposed for the study of freely-vibrating cylinder (simulating a bridge section) undergoing Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV) and <b>torsional</b> <b>flutter.</b> The Motion Induced Vortex was identified as the fundamental cause of both cases. Spanwise correlations and pressure statistics were used to determine the effects of the motion and freestream turbulence on both phenomena. It was found that small-scale turbulence (length scales size of the cylinder) had a diminishing effect on the cylinder's response (compared to smooth flow). When the length scales were increased to those found in atmospheric wind, the cylinder's response was increased for the torsional motion. <br/...|$|E
