50|$|Along {{with the}} {{development}} of information technology since the 1990s, healthcare providers realised that the information could generate significant benefits to improve their services by computerised cases and data, for instance of gaining the information for directing patient care and assessing the best patient care for specific clinical conditions. Therefore, substantial resources were collected to build China's own health informatics system. Most of these resources were arranged to construct hospital information system (HIS), which was aimed to minimise unnecessary waste and repetition, subsequently to promote the efficiency and quality-control of healthcare. By 2004, China had successfully spread HIS through approximately 35-40% of nationwide hospitals. However, the dispersion of hospital-owned HIS varies critically. In the east part of China, over 80% of hospitals constructed HIS, in northwest of China the equivalent was no more than 20%. Moreover, all of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) above rural level, approximately 80% of healthcare organisations above the rural level and 27% of hospitals over town level have the ability to perform the <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> about real-time epidemic situation through public health information system and to analysis infectious diseases by dynamic statistics.|$|E

Installed in the Department of Pathology, Singapore General Hospital (SGH), the computer system discussed comprises a RISC-based Data General Aviion 6200 computer and Meditech MAGIC software. The system has been interfaced with the hospital host IBM computer and supports patient information transfer, result reporting, phlebotomy management, and compilation of laboratory and financial management reports. The main functions of the system include: on-line and off-line acquisition of patient information and test data; preparation of single/combined/cumulative reports; <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>reports</b> within and between laboratories; instantaneous provision of data in response to telephone enquiries; calculations of quality control/workload/productivity statistics and indices; and generation of billing lists.

The <b>transmission</b> <b>of</b> <b>reporting</b> requests across the content value network combined with the possibility for authors to preserve rights over derivative works enables the system to distribute income amongst all the actors involved in different steps of the creation and distribution chain.

40|$|Uptake of {{mechanization}} in Indonesia {{is essentially}} demand- driven, although supply-side factors also exert their effects. The project {{findings indicate that}} mechanization per se is rarely the sole chief constraining factor in agricultural production systems. Consequently, mechanization is generally of lower priority than other agricultural inputs to farming systems, especially in the subsistence sector. When there is a genuine need for mechanization {{it has already been}} identified and largely fulfilled by provision of machinery and equipment through existing private sector manufacturing, fabrication and distribution networks. However, although agricultural mechanization has played only a limited, but in places significant, role in the country's development, it must be remembered that both demand and supply constraints have influenced its adoption. In light of this, it is strongly recommended that mechanization be allowed to proceed at a pace dictated by the private sector (demand and not supply driven).
