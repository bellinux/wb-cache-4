Despite all <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened,</b> Earth is too desperate for energy to give up.

5|$|Calloway {{enters the}} church {{wielding}} explosives, taking the congregation hostage. The building is quickly surrounded by police and reporters as Calloway gives a sermon to his hostages {{about the loss}} of faith. Black believes he can connect with Calloway, and is allowed to enter the church. Calloway is initially hostile, but Black is able to talk him down, convincing Calloway that his faith has not been lost, but simply tested—despite all <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened,</b> Calloway has never lost his belief in God. Realizing the truth of this, Calloway surrenders.|$|E

5|$|In {{a parody}} of Dexter, after hearing a voice that he thinks is God telling him to murder people, Ned Flanders becomes a serial killing vigilante, {{targeting}} characters who are Homer's enemies. When Flanders discovers that Homer {{is the one who}} has been duping him into committing murder (by way of a Bible-shaped receiver), Homer argues that God does not exist and starts burning Ned's bible, only to be stopped and strangled to death by God Himself. Marge begs God to reverse everything <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened,</b> but God tells her that Satan is the one who is running the world. When Flanders thinks that this scenario cannot get any worse, it is revealed that Satan is sleeping with Ned's deceased wife, Maude.|$|E
5|$|Dean Peterson {{is forced}} to expel the nerds, and a remorseful Homer {{immediately}} invites them {{to move in with}} his family. However, their presence quickly disrupts the normal family routine, and Marge orders Homer to evict them, leading him {{to try to get the}} three re-admitted to the school. Homer's plan involves an attempt to run down Dean Peterson with his car, but have the nerds push Peterson out of the way at the last moment, with the hope that Peterson would readmit the nerds out of gratitude for saving his life. But the plan backfires, and Homer winds up running down the dean, seriously injuring him. At the hospital, Homer admits he was fully responsible for the pranks, and asks that Benjamin, Doug, and Gary be reinstated. The dean agrees to reinstate them and does not punish Homer, agreeing to forget everything <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened.</b> The nerds thank Homer for his assistance and move back into their old dormitory room.|$|E

25|$|Irenaeus' {{emphasis}} on the unity of God is reflected in his corresponding {{emphasis on}} the unity of salvation history. Irenaeus repeatedly insists that God began the world and has been overseeing it ever since this creative act; everything <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> {{is part of his}} plan for humanity. The essence of this plan is a process of maturation: Irenaeus believes that humanity was created immature, and God intended his creatures {{to take a long time}} to grow into or assume the divine likeness.|$|E
25|$|An autobiographical {{memory is}} a {{personal}} representation of general or specific events and personal facts. Autobiographical memory also refers to memory of a person's history. An individual does not remember exactly everything <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> in one's past. Memory is constructive, where previous experience affects how we remember events and what we end up recalling from memory. Autobiographical memory is constructive and reconstructed as an evolving process of history. A person's autobiographical memory is fairly reliable; although, the reliability of autobiographical memories is questionable because of memory distortions.|$|E
25|$|Nietzsche {{may have}} {{encountered}} {{the idea of}} the Eternal Recurrence in the works of Heinrich Heine, who speculated that one day a person would be born with the same thought-processes as himself, and that the same applied to every other individual. Nietzsche expanded on this thought to form his theory, which he put forth in The Gay Science and developed in Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Schopenhauer directly influenced this theory. Schopenhauer postulated that a person who unconditionally affirms life would do so even if everything <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> were to happen again repeatedly.|$|E

25|$|Everything <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> {{since has}} {{therefore}} been planned by God to help humanity overcome this initial mishap and achieve spiritual maturity. The {{world has been}} intentionally designed by God as a difficult place, where human beings are forced to make moral decisions, as only in this way can they mature as moral agents. Irenaeus likens death to the big fish that swallowed Jonah: {{it was only in}} the depths of the whale's belly that Jonah could turn to God and act according to the divine will. Similarly, death and suffering appear as evils, but without them we could never come to know God.|$|E
25|$|The Ājīvika {{school is}} known for its Niyati ("Fate") {{doctrine}} of absolute determinism, the premise that there is no free will, that everything <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened,</b> is happening and will happen is entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles. Ājīvikas considered the karma doctrine as a fallacy. Ajivika metaphysics included a theory of atoms similar to the Vaisheshika school, where everything was composed of atoms, qualities emerged from aggregates of atoms, but the aggregation and nature of these atoms was predetermined by cosmic forces. Ājīvikas were atheists and rejected the authority of the Vedas, but they believed that in every living being is an ātman – a central premise of Hinduism and Jainism.|$|E
25|$|Both {{participants}} {{are currently in}} the NL Central, due to {{the transfer of the}} Brewers from the American League to the National League in 1998. This raises the possibility of the Brewers eventually representing two different leagues in World Series competition. <b>That</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> twice before, taking the 19th Century contests into account: The Brooklyn Dodgers of 1889 and 1890, and the Cardinals, who won the 1886 Series when they were in the American Association. This also makes this one of two World Series in the modern era (1903–present) that {{it is not possible to}} have a rematch, the other being the 2005 World Series between the Chicago White Sox and the Houston Astros, due to the Astros moving to the American League for 2013.|$|E

25|$|Hauerwas {{believes}} {{that there is a}} difference between the concept of death and the criteria for death. The concept of death “involves a philosophical judgment of a significant change <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> in a person” and therefore “is a correlative of what one takes to be the necessary condition of human life, e.g., … the potential for consciousness”. The criteria of death, however, are “those empirical measurements that can be made to determine whether a person is dead, such as cessation of respiration or a flat EEG”. Thus, brain death is a criterion of death that may serve “as a symbol of when it is time to die”. A person must not delay death so long that it is no longer possible to die a good death.|$|E

Havens is then {{picked up by a}} group of intelligence agents, led by Fitzgerald. Miller arrives and, through a long gunfight on the highway, kills several agents and reclaims Havens. She flees at the first opportunity and contacts Rodney (Marc Blucas), a firefighter and former boyfriend. Believing Havens is merely stressed and is playing out a fantasy, Rodney takes her out and she tells him everything <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> to her, though he still does not understand. Miller then arrives and pretends to take Havens hostage while holding everyone else at gunpoint, fleeing with her.|$|E

Though Babe and Josh reconnect on the night that Colby Chandler, JR's sister, {{is thought to be}} dead. Babe is struggling with coping with all <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>happened</b> that year.
