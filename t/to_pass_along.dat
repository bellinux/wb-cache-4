5|$|Forced labourers for the Eastern Railway were {{eventually}} {{kept in a}} separate closed camp, where conditions were {{a little better than}} at the main camp at Janowska. Wiesenthal prepared architectural drawings for Adolf Kohlrautz, the senior inspector, who submitted them under his own name. To obtain contracts, construction companies paid bribes to Kohlrautz, who shared some of the money with Wiesenthal. He was able <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> further information about the railroads to the underground and occasionally left the compound to obtain supplies, even clandestinely obtaining weapons for the Armia Krajowa and two pistols for himself, which he took along when he escaped in autumn 1943.|$|E
5|$|From {{within the}} pocket, German {{formations}} seeking an escape route were filtering through {{gaps in the}} Allied lines between Trun and Chambois, heading towards the ridge from the west. The Poles could see the road from Chambois choked with troops and vehicles attempting <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> the Dives valley. A number of columns moving down from the northeast that included tanks and self-propelled artillery were subjected to an hour-long bombardment from the 1st Armoured Regiment's 3rd Squadron, breaking them up and scattering their infantry.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway {{raised its}} prices for coal haulage. All coal hauled on the Tramway needed <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> the A from Verney Junction or Aylesbury and Jones {{had to raise}} prices to cover the {{surcharge}} or keep prices stable despite the loss of profits. Road-hauled coal from Bicester was already undercutting the Tramway and the unreliable engines had given the Tramway a poor reputation. Jones kept prices fixed and absorb the increased costs, wrecking the Tramway's already declining business.|$|E

5|$|Olivia rejoins Henry {{and then}} leaves him to swim {{the rest of}} the way in and make her way to the {{isolation}} tank. After injecting herself with the same drugs Walternate (John Noble) had used on her, she enters the tank and soon finds herself back in her own universe. She encounters a cleaning lady, and as Olivia feels herself being dragged back to the parallel universe, she gives the cleaning lady a message <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> to Peter (Joshua Jackson). Back in the isolation tank, Walternate has had Olivia extracted from the tank and directs his agents to lock her up and sedate her.|$|E
5|$|The route {{continues}} onward, traveling north {{through a}} rural, wooded area of Pawling with little development before curving west <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> {{the southern edge}} of Whaley Lake. At the southwestern tip of the lake, NY292 turns north, paralleling the western and northern shores of the lake as it heads toward the hamlet of West Pawling. North of the lake in West Pawling, NY292 turns east onto a former routing of NY55 for a short distance before ending at modern NY55 in the northwest corner of Pawling.|$|E
5|$|The EO-13 crew {{departed}} on 22 July, {{and soon}} after Mir passed through the annual Perseid meteor shower, during which the station was hit by several particles. A spacewalk was conducted on 28 September to inspect the station's hull, but no serious damage was reported. Soyuz TM-18 arrived on 10 January 1994 carrying the EO-15 crew (including Valeri Polyakov, who was to remain on Mir for 14 months), and Soyuz TM-17 left on 14 January. The undocking was unusual in that the spacecraft was <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> Kristall {{in order to obtain}} photographs of the APAS to assist in the training of space shuttle pilots. Due to an error in setting up the control system, the spacecraft struck the station a glancing blow during the manoeuvre, scratching the exterior of Kristall.|$|E

5|$|The frigate Africaine {{had been}} sent from Rochefort early in 1801 with more than 400 {{soldiers}} for the Egyptian garrison, and by February had reached the Mediterranean Sea, Commodore Saulnier seeking <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> the North African coast to avoid patrolling Royal Navy warships. On the afternoon of 19 February however the overladen French warship was discovered by the British HMS Phoebe and rapidly chased down and brought to action. In an engagement lasting two hours, the French ship {{was reduced to a}} wallowing wreck as broadsides from Phoebe tore through the hull, rigging and the soldiers packed on the decks: by the time Africaine surrendered, 200 men were dead and another 143 wounded. The captured ship was brought into the base at Port Mahon in Menorca and subsequently served in the Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|When the Syndicate {{suspect that}} one of their members is passing {{information}} to Mulder and Scully, they organise a canary trap to find the leak, using information about the safety of Mulder's mother as bait. X's role as an informant is discovered, and he is shot dead, although he is able <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> the name of another informant who can be of use to Mulder—Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden), the Special Representative to the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Covarrubias' aid is sought when Mulder attempts to reach Tunguska in Russia to investigate the source of a further black oil contamination. Whilst there, Mulder is held in a gulag and used as a successful test subject for a black oil vaccine. He escapes and is able to return to America, having found that Krycek is working with the Russians.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{contraception}} involve the cervix. Cervical diaphragms are reusable, firm-rimmed plastic devices inserted {{by a woman}} prior to intercourse that cover the cervix. Pressure against {{the walls of the}} vagina maintain the position of the diaphragm, and it acts as a physical barrier to prevent the entry of sperm into the uterus, preventing fertilisation. Cervical caps are a similar method, although they are smaller and adhere to the cervix by suction. Diaphragms and caps are often used in conjunction with spermicides. In one year, 12% of women using the diaphragm will undergo an unintended pregnancy, and with optimal use this falls to 6%. Efficacy rates are lower for the cap, with 18% of women undergoing an unintended pregnancy, and 10–13% with optimal use. Most types of progestogen-only pills are effective as a contraceptive because they thicken cervical mucus making it difficult for sperm <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> the cervical canal. In addition, they may also sometimes prevent ovulation. In contrast, contraceptive pills that contain both oestrogen and progesterone, the combined oral contraceptive pills, work mainly by preventing ovulation. They also thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus enhancing their effectiveness.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. When the Syndicate suspect {{that one of their}} members is passing {{information}} to Mulder and Scully, they organize a canary trap to find the leak, using information about the safety of Mulder's mother as bait. X's (Steven Williams) role as an informant is discovered, and he is shot dead, although he is able <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> the name of another informant who can be of use to Mulder—Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden), the Special Representative to the Secretary-General of the United Nations.

25|$|The luxurious {{interiors}} {{were designed}} in Art Déco and Streamline Moderne style. Many sculptures and wall paintings made allusions to Normandy, {{the province of}} France for which Normandie was named. Drawings and photographs show a series of vast public rooms of great elegance. Normandies voluminous interior spaces were made possible by having the funnel intakes split <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> {{the sides of the}} ship, rather than straight upward. French architect Roger-Henri Expert {{was in charge of the}} overall decorative scheme.|$|E
25|$|As sales grew, Sears {{expanded}} its production, shipping and sales offices to regional sites across the US. To provide the materials {{needed for the}} Modern Homes division, Sears first purchased a lumber mill in Cairo, Illinois. Later, Sears acquired a second mill in Port Newark, New Jersey and the Norwood Sash and Door Company in Norwood, Ohio. The ability to mass-produce the materials used in Sears homes reduced manufacturing costs, which allowed Sears <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> the savings in lower prices for customers.|$|E

25|$|In 1865 the E and the NBR amalgamated, {{keeping the}} name The North British Railway, {{and the opening}} of branch lines had led to {{substantially}} heavier traffic. The line through Waverley station was the only link between the lines east and west of Edinburgh. Mineral traffic increased considerably as the Lothian coalfield (south-east of Edinburgh) was developed, and much of the extracted mineral was consigned to the west of Scotland for shipment. All the goods and mineral traffic had <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> the double track route from Portobello to Haymarket through Waverley station, finding a path between the increasingly frequent passenger services.|$|E
25|$|About 130 delegates were in {{attendance}} {{as the first}} conference of the Independent Labour Party was gavelled to order, including in addition to Hardie such socialist and labour worthies as Alderman Ben Tillett, author George Bernard Shaw, and Edward Aveling, son-in-law of Karl Marx. Some 91 local branches of the Independent Labour Party were represented, joined by 11 local Fabian Societies, four branches of the Social Democratic Federation, and individual representatives {{of a number of}} other socialist and labour groups. German Socialist leader Edward Bernstein was briefly permitted to address the gathering <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> the best wishes for success from the Social Democratic Party of Germany.|$|E
25|$|Small {{and highly}} agile {{paramilitary}} mobile teams {{spread out over}} the countryside to meet with locals and gather information about the Taliban and al-Qa'ida. During that time, one of the teams was approached in a village and asked by a young man for help in retrieving his teenage sister. He explained that a senior Taliban official had taken her as a wife and had sharply restricted the time she could spend with her family. The team gave the man a small hand-held tracking device <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> to his sister, with instructions for her to activate it when the Taliban leader returned home. The team responded to her emergency signal, capturing the senior Taliban official and rescuing the sister. The siblings' tearful reunion left the team {{at a loss for}} words—a rarity for the normally loud warriors of CIA's Special Activities Division.|$|E

MD 108 continues through the village of Clarksville, where the highway intersects Guilford Road and Ten Oaks Road. Just north of the latter road, the highway expands to four lanes at its diamond interchange with MD 32, which heads east as the Patuxent Freeway and northwest as Sykesville Road. MD 108 gains a center turn lane as it begins <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>along</b> the northern edge of the large, planned community of Columbia.
