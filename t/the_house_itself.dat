5|$|Danish country vicarages {{from this}} period tended {{to be built in}} the same style as farmhouses, though usually rather larger. A fine example is Kølstrup Vicarage near Kerteminde in {{north-eastern}} Funen. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> is a thatched half-timbered building with a large rectangular courtyard flanked by outhouses.|$|E

5|$|The {{architecture}} of the original building is attributed to Nicholas Hawksmoor, with some alterations from around 1900 and the subsequent modern 1960s extensions. The original mansion is in the Queen Anne style. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> has three storeys constructed of red brick. The ground floor level has a rubbed brick band at nine courses, and another rubbed brick band exists on the second floor, along with a moulded stone cornice level with the sills.|$|E

5|$|The barn {{was built}} {{sometime}} around 1871, possibly even before, and is constructed {{of the same}} soft brick that makes up {{the exterior of the}} home. Tradition in the Glidden family holds that the barn, like <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>itself,</b> was designed and built by prominent local carpenter Jacob Haish. The famous barn, one of DeKalb County's oldest remaining, stands a full two-stories high, measuring around 50feet (15m) tall, with a width of 30feet (9m).|$|E
5|$|The listed {{building}} consent application for the demolition was recommended for approval although some concerns were raised regarding {{the proposed new}} constructions, which were to be detailed in a separate application. Other applications made at the time, for the demolition of other buildings on the site and for the refurbishment and change of use of <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> were also recommended for approval.|$|E
5|$|After {{their own}} house was {{destroyed}} in the Great Kantō earthquake, Raymond designed a new one, the Reinanzaka House, in Azabu, Tokyo. His desire to free himself from Wright's influence led him to explore spatial relationships between living, working and dining areas and how spaces could be closed off with folding screens.The house is built almost entirely of in situ concrete. Raymond's workforce were enthusiastic {{in their use of}} this new material, likening it to the walls of traditional kura storehouses. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> had metal fenestration, tubular steel trellises and traditional rain chains rather than rainwater downpipes. The interior too was well in advance of other houses of the International Style with the use of cantilevered tubular steel furniture.|$|E

5|$|Although the Hiorns had descendants, {{the estate}} was {{managed by the}} Public Trustee, who put Linwood House up for sale as four {{sections}}, {{with one of those}} holding <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>itself.</b> Three of the sections were purchased by Thomas Marker on 4 June 1913 in an auction, including the one containing the building. Marker paid ₤200 each for the building sections, and ₤1,250 for the section containing the house. The furniture of Linwood House was sold in a separate auction. The house was rented to lawyer Francis Ion Cowlishaw, son of prominent provincial councillor William Patten Cowlishaw (1839–1903). Cowlishaw senior had lived nearby in a house named 'Chaddesden', and Cowlishaw Street and Chaddesden Lane are named after the family.|$|E
5|$|Clevedon Court is on Court Hill east of {{the town}} centre, close to the road to Bristol. It {{is one of only}} a few {{remaining}} 14th century manorial halls in England, having been built by Sir John de Clevedon circa 1320. Since the early eighteenth century the house has been owned by the Elton family, who were responsible for much building work on the house and many improvements in the town, and although <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> is now owned by the National Trust, the associated estates are still owned by the Elton family. Sir Edmund Elton (1846–1920) was a potter who produced unusually shaped ware in a variety of richly-coloured glazes, including a gold glaze of his own invention, at the Clevedon Elton Sunflower Pottery.|$|E
5|$|Osea was {{the second}} {{tropical}} cyclone to impact French Polynesia during the season; Cyclone Martin had impacted the islands a few weeks earlier. In {{the aftermath of the}} storm, disaster aid was delivered to the victims of Osea. President Gaston Flosse, accompanied by technicians, arrived in Maupiti to help repair the island's electrical and hydraulic systems. A Latter-Day Saint meeting house was used as an emergency shelter, though <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> sustained minor damage from the storm. The name Osea was later retired from the South Pacific list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E

5|$|A royal hunting park {{close to}} Melbourne was {{probably}} created by King John around 1200, and the King {{is known to}} have stayed at the manor house on at least five occasions. John gave the manor and its lands to Hugh Beauchamp, although they appear to have soon reverted to the crown, being gifted by Henry III to Bishop Walter Mauclerk of Carlisle in about 1230. The estate returned to the crown on the bishop's death in 1248, and Henry granted the land to his son, Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster, in 1265. At some later date, the manor appears to have been granted to a Philip Marc, before passing to Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, the King's son. This was in 1298 when he came of age, his father having died two years earlier. Early references to <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> are rare, but there are records of repairs to the gutters in 1246 and to the roof of the King's Chamber in 1248.|$|E
5|$|The Fuller Houses are two {{historic}} {{homes at}} 339-341 and 343-345 Broadway in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Constructed in 1896-1897, the two Queen Anne-styled homes were constructed as rental properties for the Fuller family and {{are believed to}} have originally been identical in construction. The -story houses are marked by an octagonal bay which contains the front staircase and a large two-story porch projecting almost completely from <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>itself.</b> For the National Register of Historic Places nomination only a single unit was examined, but the identical unit below is believed to have undergone minimal alterations. The other house, 343-345 Broadway, was not surveyed, but has been more seriously modified to allow for four apartment units. The Fuller Houses are architecturally significant as well-preserved and well-detailed Queen Anne-styled apartment flats. The Fuller Houses were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{contains}} {{a total of}} 58 Grade II listed buildings, including a Grade II* listed barn, and the Church of the Holy Cross, a Grade I listed building. The church dates from the late 12th century with early 13th and 15th century additions, {{as well as a}} substantial restoration in 1863. The building itself consists of stone walls, a tiled roof, and a stone slated porch. The oldest part is the chancel, which dates from the 12th century with 15th century extensions. The north chapel was altered in 1331, and in its churchyard is the grave of famed Second World War Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery (Viscount Montgomery of Alamein). Other listed buildings include Barnfield House – three houses which were once separated all dating from 1550 with 20th century restorations. <b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> has a timber frame with a tiled roof, including a late medieval hall. Mill Court, another Grade II listed building, is a large house dating from the early 19th century with a low pitched roof and yellow brickwork, and became a listed building on 15 August 1985.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Big <b>House</b> {{was listed}} on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. [...] The listing {{included}} two contributing buildings, <b>the</b> Big <b>House</b> <b>itself</b> and a Granary located near <b>the</b> <b>house</b> and built about 1880.|$|R

Driven by the crankshaft, which is connected to the displacer shaft by a small belt, the displacer moves eccentrically with respect to <b>the</b> supercharger <b>housing</b> (like <b>the</b> rotor in a Wankel engine) and, through this motion, forces the intake air into a smaller and smaller space, ultimately producing a maximum gauge pressure of [...] with standard delivered pulleys.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> is a two-and-a-half-story three-by-two-bay wood frame {{structure}} on a raised fieldstone foundation, allowing for an English basement at the front.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> is {{relatively}} simple, {{but for the}} late 16th century {{it would have been}} considered quite a substantial dwelling. John Shakespeare, William's father, was a glove maker and wool dealer, and the house was originally divided in two parts to allow him to carry out his business from the same premises.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>house</b> <b>itself</b> is a two-and-half-story five-by-four-bay {{building}} sided in stucco over rubble stone, {{with two}} frame wings {{on the north}} and south. The latter was originally sanded {{to give it a}} stonier appearance. A veranda is on the west (rear) elevation. The metallic hipped roof is pierced by two pairs of brick chimneys on the sides.|$|E
50|$|Allied to {{this was}} the declining {{standards}} of <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>itself.</b> Since <b>the</b> scheme was built, some effort {{had been made to}} improve some of <b>the</b> <b>housing,</b> such as replacing some flat roofs with pitched roofs more able to resist the weather. However, <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> suffered from problems such as poor insulation and damp. The cheap, quick solution to <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> problems of <b>the</b> 1950s and 1960s proved also to be short-term, and when it was realised that refurbishing the buildings was financially not viable, the decision was taken to regenerate the area more fundamentally.|$|R
50|$|For {{some of the}} new {{inhabitants}} <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>itself</b> was a problem. In old Most {{they were}} used to low category apartments in which they burned coal. Modern top category apartments with central heating were a complete novelty for them. This has been cited as {{one of the reasons for}} the ensuing devastation of <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> stock in Chánov - as people were unable to make good use of the modern apartments, they thus adapted them to how they thought they should be.|$|R
