40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the causes of acute intranatal hypoxia and reveal a {{relationship}} of placental changes to respiratory failure (RF) in newborn infants. Subjects and methods. The investigation included 252 neonates with the complicated course of an early neonatal period. Their gestational age was 26 weeks to 40 weeks, birth weight varied from 850 g to 4100 g. 95. 3 % of the newborn infants were born with a low Apgar score and RF, which required mechanical ventilation immediately after birth. The neonatal status was clinically evaluated; the values of blood gas composition and acid-base balance were recorded; the pathogen was discharged from the tracheobronchial tree; chest X-ray survey and placental morphological examination were performed. Results. The main cause of neonatal respiratory failure is chronic intrauterine hypoxia caused by placental inflammatory changes and fetal-placental blood circulatory disorders, which gives rise to preterm delivery, cerebral hemodynamic disorders, and neonatal amniotic fluid aspiration. Bacteriological examination of <b>tracheobronchial</b> <b>aspirations</b> showed that no microflora growth occured {{in the majority of}} the newborns acute intranatal hypoxia. Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated in 12. 3 % and 8. 7 %, respectively. Growth of в-hemolytic streptococcus was observed in 2. 8 % of cases. The rate of microbial association specific only for rate premature infants with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) was 4. 8 %. Conclusion. Placental changes causing fetal-placental circulatory disorders were ascertained to be responsible for acute intranatal and postnatal neonatal hypoxia. Placental inflammatory changes occurred in the majority of cases, as confirmed by bacteriological examinations of neonatal infants. Isolation of the varying microbial flora in infants with RF to a greater extent is, indicative of the infectious process occurring in the maternal body.

40|$|Background: <b>Tracheobronchial</b> {{foreign body}} <b>aspirations,</b> which {{threaten}} lives in childhood, also carry potential risks {{during and after}} bronchoscopy. The {{aim of this study}} is to review complications and pre-cautions that need to be taken against possible risks. Methods: From 1987 to 2005, bronchoscopy was done in 1035 children in our department on suspicion of foreign body aspiration. The average age of these patients, mostly male (55 &#x 0025;), was 4. 1 years. Medical history, physical examination, radiological methods and bronchoscopy were used in the diagnosis. Bronchoscopy was applied under general anaes-thesia, and the respiratory and cardiac systems were closely observed for 4 hours after the process. Results: Nine hundred eleven of 1035 patients (88 &#x 0025;) had a foreign body in the tracheobronchial system. In 42 of the patients, infection required aggressive medication; in 30, hypoxia and bradycardia occurred as a result of obstruction during bronchoscopy; in 37, laryngeal edema, laryn-geal spasm and/or bronchospasm required ventilation support; in 6 pa-tients, tracheobronchial system bleeding occurred; in 2 patients pneu-mothorax occurred, in 1 patient pneumomediastinum was observed and 6 patients needed thoracotomies because of foreign body aspiration.

Twenty-eight patients out of 128 patients presented late (> 1 month). The medical records of those 28 patients were reviewed in respect to: history of FB aspiration, physical signs of symptoms, reason for delayed presentation, radiological investigation, complications and their management, and follow-up. There were 16 males and 12 females; the average age was 3. 28 years (range 1 – 11 years). All of them experienced chronic cough at presentation. Thirteen (48 per cent) children had a history suggestive of FB aspiration. Seventeen (63 per cent) children presented with complications that included pneumonia (n= 13), bronchiectasis (n= 3), and bronchoesophageal fistula (n= 1). The diagnostic delay was attributed to physician misdiagnosis (n= 9), failure by parents to seek early medical advice (n= 4), patients left against medical advice (n= 1), and the cause of delay was unknown in the remaining 14 children.

40|$|Between 1964 and 1979, a {{total of}} 1, 536 {{patients}} with carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus were treated at the authors' center. Of these, 142 patients with unresectable tumor underwent the Kirschner operation for palliation. In this operation, esophageal obstruction is bypassed by subcutaneous or retrosternal gastric esophagoplasty, and the thoracic esophagus defunctionalized by a long Roux-en-Y jejunal loop to the abdominal esophagus. Dysphagia is thus relieved and aspiration of esophageal and gastric contents into the respiratory tract avoided. Any patient who was not discharged from the hospital for any reason and eventually died in the hospital is counted as a mortality. The hospital mortality for these 142 patients was 41. 5 % (59 patients). In recent {{years there has been}} a reduction in mortality rate. The most common cause of death was progressive bronchopneumonia (72. 9 %). Leakage of anastomosis occurred in 67 patients (47. 2 %), but most healed on conservative treatment. The ability to eat normally was restored in 69 % of survivors, and another 28 % were able to tolerate a soft diet. Although temporary postoperative aspiration was occasionally encountered when the patient started oral feeding, once swallowing was established, <b>tracheobronchial</b> <b>aspiration</b> did not occur. The mean survival of the discharged patients was 5. 0 months. Malignant cachexia from growth of the primary tumor accounted for 61. 4 % of late deaths; metastatic disease, 10. 8 %; and cardiopulmonary insufficiency, the remainder. One patient is alive more than 5 years after operation, and presumably was cured by postoperative radiotherapy. Although the mortality rate of the Kirschner operation is substantial, other forms of treatment also have significant mortality rates but with less palliative potential.

40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{morbidity}} and mortality worldwide. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to prevent Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission. Bronchoscopy can play a primary role in pulmonary TB diagnosis, particularly for suspected patients with scarce sputum or sputum smear negativity, and with endobronchial disease. Bronchoscopic needle aspiration techniques are accurate and safe means adopted to investigate hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes in cases of suspected TB lymphadenopathy. Tracheobronchial stenosis represents the worst complication of endobronchial tuberculosis. Bronchoscopic procedures are less invasive therapeutic strategies than conventional surgery to be adopted in the management of TB-related stenosis. We conducted a non-systematic review aimed at describing the scientific literature on the role of bronchoscopic techniques in the diagnosis and therapy of patients with TB. We focused on three main areas of interventions: bronchoscopic diagnosis of smear negative/sputum scarce TB patients, endobronchial TB diagnosis and treatment and needle aspiration techniques for intrathoracic TB lymphadenopathy. We described experiences on bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial washing, and biopsy techniques for the diagnosis of patients with tracheobronchial and pulmonary TB; furthermore, we described the role played by conventional and ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration in the diagnosis of suspected hilar and mediastinal TB adenopathy. Finally, we assessed the role of the bronchoscopic therapy in the treatment of endobronchial TB and its complications, focusing on dilation techniques (such as balloon dilation and airway stenting) and ablative procedures (both heat and cold therapies).

Once the R. equi in the mare feces were quantified and the total concentrations of R. equi determined, a colony immunoblot procedure was performed to detect {{the presence of the}} virulence-associated protein antigen on the isolates. This allowed for the proportion and concentration of virulent R. equi to be determined. Foals that were found to have ultrasonographic evidence of peripheral pulmonary abscessation or consolidation underwent aseptic trans-cutaneous <b>tracheobronchial</b> <b>aspiration.</b> Positive results of TBA were used to categorize foals as affected with R. equi pneumonia. R. equi pneumonia developed in 31 % of the foals. Shedding of virulent R. equi was observed in at least 1 sampling period for every mare examined, and > 33 % were culture-positive during all sampling periods. However, significant differences were not observed in either the fecal concentrations of total or virulent R. equi from dams of affected foals compared to dams of unaffected foals. No significant temporal changes in the fecal concentrations of R. equi were observed. It was concluded that dams of affected foals do not shed more R. equi in feces than do dams of unaffected foals, indicating that heavier shedding by particular mares does not explain infection in their foals. However, the finding that virulent R. equi were excreted in the feces of all sampled mares indicates that mares are likely an important source of R. equi for their surrounding environment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Respiratory tract {{infections are}} common in {{intensive}} care units (ICU), with incidences reported from 10 to 65 %, and case fatality rates over 20 % in pneumonia. This {{study was designed to}} identify risk factors for the development of an early onset respiratory tract infection (ERI) and to review the microbiological profile and the effectiveness of first intention antibiotic therapy. Methods Case-control, retrospective clinical study of the patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of our hospital, a teaching and tertiary care facility, from January to September 2000 who had a respiratory tract infection diagnosed in the first 5 days of hospital stay. Results Of the 385 patients admitted to our unit: 129 (33, 5 %) had a diagnosis of ERI and 86 patients were admitted to the control group. Documented aspiration (adjusted OR = 5, 265; 95 % CI = 1, 155 – 24, 007) and fractured ribs (adjusted OR = 12, 150; 95 % CI = 1, 571 – 93, 941) were found to be independent risk factors for the development of ERI (multiple logistic regression model performed with the diagnostic group as dependent variable and adjusted for age, sex, SAPS II, documented aspiration, non-elective oro-tracheal intubation (OTI), fractured ribs, pneumothorax and pleural effusion). A total of 78 organisms were isolated in 61 patients (47 %). The normal flora of the upper airway (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenza and Moraxella catharralis) accounted for 72 % of all isolations achieved, polimicrobian infections were responsible for 25 % of all microbiological documented infections.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the role of clinical history, physical examinations, and radiological findings in the evaluation of patients with suspected radiolucent foreign body aspiration. Methods: The medical records of 236 children (under the age of 18 years), on whom a rigid bronchoscopy was performed between 1999 and 2015 because of suspected radiolucent foreign body aspiration, were analyzed retrospectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of clinical history, physical examinations, and radiological findings were evaluated. Results: In 71. 1 % of all cases, the children were under the age of 3 years. The bronchoscopy showed the presence of a foreign body in 52. 9 % of cases, with the locations of the foreign bodies being as follows: (1) right main bronchus, 47. 2 %; (2) left main bronchus, 36. 0 %; (3) trachea, 11. 2 %; (4) both bronchi, 5. 6 %. Organic foreign bodies were found in 78 % of the patients, whereas inorganic foreign bodies were detected in 22 % of the patients. The sensitivity and specificity of clinical history, physical examinations, and radiological findings were 98. 4 % and 54. 9 %, 47. 2 % and 74. 7 %, and 35. 2 % and 92. 7 %, respectively. Conclusion: <b>Tracheobronchial</b> foreign body <b>aspirations</b> usually occur prior to the age of 3 years, with the most frequently aspirated foreign bodies being food or items of a radiolucent nature. Clinical history, physical examinations, and radiological findings are not able to detect the presence of a radiolucent foreign body aspiration in children. Therefore, a bronchoscopy should be performed on children in whom a choking event has been witnessed, even in cases of normal radiological and clinical findings...|$|R
