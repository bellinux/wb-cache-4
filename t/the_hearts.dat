5|$|Humans {{have known}} about <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> since ancient times, {{although}} its precise function and anatomy were not clearly understood.

Aristotle considered <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to be organ responsible for creating blood; Plato considered <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> as <b>the</b> source of circulating blood and Hippocrates noted blood circulating cyclically from the body through <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> to <b>the</b> lungs. Erasistratos (304â€“250 BCE) noted <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> as a pump, causing dilation of blood vessels, and noted that arteries and veins both radiate from <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> becoming progressively smaller with distance, although he believed they were filled with air and not blood.

5|$|Krishna-related {{literature}} {{such as the}} Bhagavata Purana accords {{a metaphysical}} significance to the performances and treats them as religious ritual, infusing daily life with spiritual meaning, thus representing a good, honest, happy life.

Singing, dancing, and performance of any part of Krishna Lila {{is an act of}} remembering the dharma in the text, as a form of para bhakti (supreme devotion). To remember Krishna at any time and in any art, asserts the text, is to worship the good and the divine.|$|E

5|$|The series {{starts with}} Kingdom Hearts, where a 14-year-old boy named Sora is {{separated}} from his friends Riku and Kairi when their world, Destiny Islands, is invaded by creatures known as the Heartless. During the invasion, Sora obtains a weapon called the Keyblade {{that allows him to}} fight the Heartless. He soon arrives in another world, Traverse Town, where he meets Donald Duck and Goofy, two emissaries from Disney Castle sent to find the Keyblade wielder under orders from their missing king, Mickey Mouse. The three band together and travel to different Disney-themed worlds, sealing <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> of the worlds to prevent more Heartless from devouring <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> of those worlds as they search for their companions. Along the way, they encounter a group of Disney villains led by Maleficent, who are controlling the Heartless to capture seven maidens called the Princesses of Heart, and use their power to open the door to Kingdom Hearts, the heart of all worlds. Though they eventually defeat Maleficent, the three discover a sentient Heartless named Ansem to be the true orchestrator of the worlds' destruction. The three defeat Ansem and seal the door to Kingdom Hearts, but remain separated from Riku and King Mickey while Kairi remains home to await her friends' return.|$|E

5|$|Amphibians are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} frogs, salamanders and caecilians. They are tetrapods, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock {{with each other and}} have articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, but contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands. <b>The</b> <b>hearts</b> of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping, a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist.|$|E

They reunite with King Mickey and encounter Xemnas, the leader of Organization XIII and Nobody of Xehanort, revealed to be the human form of the Heartless Ansem. The Organization's plan is also revealed: they seek to regain their lost hearts by creating {{their own version of}} Kingdom Hearts from the sum of all <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> released from the Heartless slain by Sora's Keyblade.

5|$|Morton soon {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a strong advocate for allowing free enterprise and business to take precedence over planning controls and government regulation. His time as Minister was marked by increasing strains on state infrastructure and his pro-development stance was largely attributed as an attempt to alleviate these problems. Despite this, Morton and his State Planning Authority were continuously criticised for not being totally accountable to the public, particularly as the pro-business Sydney Commissioners worked side-by-side with the Planning authority to increase developments in the Sydney CBD to their highest levels ever, embodied by the construction of the MLC Centre, the demolition of the Theatre Royal, Sydney and the Australia Hotel. Among the most controversial schemes planned by his government were also a massive freeway system that was planned to be driven through <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> of historic inner-city suburbs including Glebe and Newtown and an equally ambitious scheme of 'slum clearance' that would have brought about the wholescale destruction of the historic areas of Woolloomooloo and The Rocks.
