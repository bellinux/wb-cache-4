5|$|Between April 1918 and May 1919, the Spanish Flu killed {{approximately}} 25 {{million people}} worldwide, far more <b>than</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> killed {{in four years}} of war.

5|$|Elizabeth Armstrong {{was praised}} {{by some as}} a heroine for her actions during the battle, {{displaying}} the kind of courage under fire the militia had so badly lacked during the first months of the Black Hawk War. Her actions, in part, helped the fort's outnumbered defenders give Black Hawk the impression the Apple River Fort was more heavily defended <b>than</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> anticipated.|$|E
5|$|In 1771, {{using the}} {{combined}} 1761 and 1769 transit data, the French astronomer Jérôme Lalande calculated the astronomical unit {{to have a}} value of 153 million kilometers (±1 million km).

5|$|The author Rupert Christiansen {{points out}} that the {{painting}} depicts more figures <b>than</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> on the raft {{at the time of the}} rescue—including corpses which were not recorded by the rescuers. Instead of the sunny morning and calm water reported on the day of the rescue, Géricault depicted a gathering storm and dark, heaving sea to reinforce the emotional gloom.|$|E
5|$|A {{revision}} to Allied plans {{meant that}} Morotai played {{a much greater}} role in the liberation of the Philippines <b>than</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> originally envisioned. The invasion of Mindanao was postponed in September 1944 in favour of a landing at Leyte in the central Philippines in late October. The air bases at Morotai were the closest Allied air strips to Leyte, and fighters and bombers based on the island attacked targets in the southern Philippines and NEI {{in support of the}} landing at Leyte on 25 October. After airfields were completed at Leyte, Morotai was also used as a staging point for fighters and bombers traveling to the Philippines.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} {{under the}} Aros settlement's defences indicate {{the site was}} a town {{as early as the}} last quarter of the 8thcentury, considerably earlier <b>than</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> generally supposed. Discoveries after a 2003 archaeological dig unearthed half-buried longhouses, firepits, glass pearls and a road dated to the late 700s. Archaeologists have conducted several excavations in the inner city since the 1960s revealing wells, streets, homes and workshops. In the buildings and adjoining archaeological layers, everyday utensils like combs, jewellery and basic multi-purpose tools from approximately the year 900 have been found.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impact was a NASA {{space probe}} {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 18:47 UTC on January 12, 2005. It {{was designed to}} study the interior composition of the comet Tempel 1 (9P/Tempel), by releasing an impactor into the comet. At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. The impact excavated debris from {{the interior of the}} nucleus, forming an impact crater. Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy <b>than</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> expected. The impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright dust cloud, obscuring the view of the impact crater.|$|E
5|$|During Oblivions development, Bethesda {{concentrated}} on creating {{a system with}} a more realistic storyline, believable characters, and meaningful quests <b>than</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> done in the past. In comparison with previous titles in the series, the game features improved artificial intelligence thanks {{to the use of}} Bethesda proprietary Radiant A.I. software, and enhanced physics facilitated by the Havok physics engine. The graphics take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines such as high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the building of Oblivions terrain, leading to the expedited creation of landscapes that are more complex and realistic than in past titles.|$|E

5|$|In the end, the Alsos Mission contributed {{little to}} the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany, because the German nuclear and {{biological}} weapons programs {{that it had been}} formed to investigate turned out to be smaller and less threatening <b>than</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> feared. In the field of nuclear weapons development at least, the underfunded and disorganized German program lagged far behind the Allies' own efforts. In its appropriation of the accomplishments of European science, the Alsos Mission played a small part in the wartime and subsequent scientific and technological developments that characterized and transformed the postwar world.|$|E
5|$|John Sadler has {{described}} this expedition as 'like {{so many of}} its predecessors, fail to yield any significant results,' neither forcing the Scots onto a battlefield nor making any major territorial gains. Brown too {{has described}} the campaign as 'utterly futile.' Sadler has ascribed the Scottish success in part to their reliance on a Fabian strategy to wear out the English whilst avoiding direct confrontation. Henry's lacklustre campaign was condemned by contemporary observers, with Welsh chronicler Adam of Usk saying that the Scots did more damage to the English <b>than</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> done to them. Likewise, the Scotichronicon suggested that 'nothing worthy of remembrance was done' by their enemies.|$|E

However, when he finally began his minor league rehab assignment at Class-A Rancho Cucamonga in late August, he struggled at the plate and his return date was pushed back. He went hitless in five games, with seven strikeouts, and when the minor league season ended on September 2 he was moved to Camelback Ranch to continue his rehab rather than being activated.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa {{wasted no}} time moving onto his next project: Madadayo, or Not Yet. Based on autobiographical essays by Hyakken Uchida, the film follows {{the life of a}} Japanese {{professor}} of German through the Second World War and beyond. The narrative centers on yearly birthday celebrations with his former students, during which the protagonist declares his unwillingness to die just yet—a theme that was becoming increasingly relevant for the film's 81-year-old creator. Filming began in February 1992 and wrapped by the end of September. Its release on April 17, 1993, was greeted by an even more disappointed reaction <b>than</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the case with his two preceding works.|$|E
5|$|On D-Day, the 1st Special Service Brigade was {{tasked with}} linking {{up with the}} 6th Airborne Division on the eastern flank of Sword and {{securing}} the high ground near La Plein. No. 3 Commando landed at La Breche, west of Ouistreham at 09:05 coming ashore in the second wave. They were engaged before they hit the beach, {{and three of the}} landing craft that the Commandos were travelling in were hit by high-velocity shells.
