5|$|To prevent injuries, boulderers {{position}} crash pads {{near the}} boulder {{to provide a}} softer landing, {{as well as one}} or more spotters to help redirect the climber towards the pads. Upon landing, boulderers employ falling techniques similar to those used in gymnastics: spreading the impact across the entire body to avoid bone fractures, and positioning limbs to allow joints <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>freely</b> throughout the impact.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Gravity Bone, Thirty Flights of Loving employs {{non-linear}} storytelling, {{forcing the}} player {{to piece together}} the narrative. During gameplay, objectives and guidance are provided through the player's interactions with objects. The player has little control over the game mechanics and is only able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>freely</b> and pick up objects as needed to progress. Several optional actions, such as drinking alcohol, are available at several stages of the game.|$|E

5|$|Outer {{space is}} the closest known {{approximation}} to a perfect vacuum. It has effectively no friction, allowing stars, planets and moons <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>freely</b> along their ideal orbits. However, even the deep vacuum of intergalactic space is not devoid of matter, as it contains a few hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. By comparison, the air humans breathe contains about 1025 molecules per cubic meter. The low density of matter in outer space means that electromagnetic radiation can travel great distances without being scattered: the mean free path of a photon in intergalactic space is about 1023km, or 10 billion light years. In spite of this, extinction, which is the absorption and scattering of photons by dust and gas, {{is an important factor}} in galactic and intergalactic astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{the construction of}} a castle led to the destruction of a village, such as at Eaton Socon in England, it was more common for the villages nearby to have grown {{as a result of the}} presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle. The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confined to Europe. When the 13th-century Safad Castle was founded in Galilee in the Holy Land, the 260villages benefitted from the inhabitants' newfound ability <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>freely.</b> When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local landscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord. Settlements could also grow naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of proximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importance– perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration– the benefits of living next to a castle vanished and the settlement depopulated.|$|E
5|$|For the {{hand-held}} camera footage, Soderbergh used Panavision Millennium XLs {{that were}} smaller and lighter than previous cameras and allowed him <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>freely.</b> In order {{to tell the}} three stories apart, he adopted a distinctive look for each. For Robert Wakefield's story, Soderbergh used tungsten film with no filter for a cold, monochrome blue feel. For Helena Ayala's story, Soderbergh used diffusion filters, flashing the film, overexposing it for a warmer feel. For Javier Rodriguez's story, the director used tobacco filters and a 45-degree shutter angle whenever possible to produce a strobe-like sharp feel. Then, he took the entire film through an Ektachrome step, which increased the contrast and grain significantly. He wanted to have different looks for each story because the audience had {{to keep track of}} many characters and absorb a lot of information and he did not want them to have to figure out which story they were watching.|$|E

5|$|King William {{appears to}} have left the {{initiative}} for Stigand's deposition to the papacy, and did nothing to hinder Stigand's authority until the papal legates arrived in England to depose the archbishop and reform the English Church. Besides witnessing charters and consecrating Remigius, Stigand {{appears to have}} been a member of the royal council, and able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>freely</b> about the country. But after the arrival of the legates, William did nothing to protect Stigand from deposition, and the archbishop later accused the king of acting with bad faith. Stigand may even have been surprised that the legates wished him deposed. It was probably the death of Ealdred in 1069 that moved the pope to send the legates, as that left only one archbishop in England; and he was not considered legitimate and unable to consecrate bishops. The historian George Garnett draws the parallel between the treatment of King Harold in Domesday Book, where he is essentially ignored as king, and Stigand's treatment after his deposition, where his time as archbishop is as much as possible treated as not occurring.|$|E

Kathy also finds the mark morally questionable, but David convinces her {{that they have no}} choice. The fake mark allows Kathy and David <b>to</b> <b>move</b> about <b>freely</b> through checkpoints where guards are checking people to make sure they have the mark, but when they {{attempt to use}} it to buy groceries, the plan falls through.|$|R

25|$|It is {{possible}} that the turbulence caused the torque tube driving the port elevator to break; this would allow the port elevator <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>freely,</b> but the pilots would still retain approximately half of their attitude control. The aircraft also had a defective push–pull rod and worn steering cables, although it is not certain if this was part of the cause.|$|E

25|$|As the letter-keys were {{attached}} to levers that needed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>freely,</b> inventor Christopher Sholes developed the QWERTY layout to {{reduce the likelihood of}} jamming. With the advent of computers, lever jams are no longer an issue, but nevertheless, QWERTY layouts were adopted for electronic keyboards because they were widely used. Alternative layouts such as the Dvorak Simplified Keyboard are not in widespread use.|$|E
25|$|The {{weight of}} the boiler rested on the water drums, and thus on {{supports}} from the firing flat's deck. The steam drum was only supported by the watertubes and was allowed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>freely,</b> with thermal expansion. If superheated, the superheater elements were hung from this drum. Compared to the earlier Scotch and locomotive boilers, water-tube boilers with their reduced water volumes were considered lightweight and didn't require extensive supports.|$|E

25|$|Slave {{women under}} sharia {{did not have}} a right to own {{property}} or <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>freely.</b> Sharia, in Islam's history, provided a religious foundation for enslaving non-Muslim women (and men), but allowed for the manumission of slaves. However, manumission required that the non-Muslim slave first convert to Islam. A non-Muslim slave woman who bore children to her Muslim master became legally free upon her master's death, and her children were presumed to be Muslims like their father, in Africa and elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|In simple terms, {{panmixia}} (or panmicticism) is {{the ability}} of individuals in a population to interbreed without restrictions; individuals are able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> about <b>freely</b> within their habitat, possibly over a range of hundreds to thousands of miles, and thus breed {{with other members of the}} population.|$|R
