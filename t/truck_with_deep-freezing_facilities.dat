5000|$|Early {{visitors}} to St Paul {{found that it}} was possible to catch a lobster by hand in shallow water in the crater lake bay, take it to a nearby submarine hot spring, and cook it, without ever removing it from the water. In 1928, a large-scale fishery and cannery for the spiny lobster using lobster pots was set up on St Paul, but the company went bankrupt three years later, stranding seven people on the island and leading to a tragedy known as [...] "Les Oubliés de Saint-Paul" [...] (the forgotten ones of Saint-Paul). In the next two decades, there were several, largely unsuccessful, attempts to harvest the lobsters using factory ships. In the period 1950 to 1956, the spiny lobsters were harvested by the French company Sapmer with about 260 tonnes of lobster tails being processed annually (equivalent to about 800 tonnes of whole lobster). This company still operates factory vessels equipped <b>with</b> <b>deep-freeze</b> <b>facilities</b> in the area.|$|R
