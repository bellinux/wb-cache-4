5|$|Abdur-Rahim was sent, {{along with}} Theo Ratliff and Dan Dickau, to the Portland Trail Blazers on February 9, 2004 in {{exchange}} for Rasheed Wallace and Wesley Person. His impact in the two seasons with the Trail Blazers was considerably less <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> seasons. His average was 16.3ppg/7.5rpg and 16.8/7.3rpg for the 2003–04 and 2004–05 campaigns respectively. At {{the end of the}} 2004–05 season, Abdur-Rahim became a free agent.|$|E
5|$|Although American {{casualties}} in Operation Lüttich were significantly lighter <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> operations, certain {{sectors of the}} front, notably the positions held by the 30th Division around Mortain, took severe casualties. By the end of 7 August alone, nearly 1,000 men of the 30th Division had been killed.

5|$|Baggio was {{not fully}} {{fit for the}} final against Brazil at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, after pulling his {{hamstring}} during the semi-final and playing {{with the aid of}} a painkiller injection. Despite being far less dominant <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> matches, he still tested Brazilian goalkeeper Cláudio Taffarel and was able to set up a few chances for his teammates. The match ended 0–0 after extra time; he took Italy's last penalty in the resulting shootout, but his kick went over the cross-bar and the Brazilians won the title in one of the most upsetting moments in World Cup history.|$|E
5|$|In his {{campaign}} for a fourth term, Johnson concentrated on three issues: slavery, homesteads and judicial elections. He defeated his opponent, Nathaniel G. Taylor, in August 1849, with a greater margin of victory <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> campaigns. When the House convened in December, the party division caused by the Free Soil Party precluded {{the formation of the}} majority needed to elect a Speaker. Johnson proposed adoption of a rule allowing election of a Speaker by a plurality; some weeks later others took up a similar proposal, and Democrat Howell Cobb was elected.|$|E

5|$|Lightning has {{received}} mixed commentary from critics—much of it relating to her cold personality, which {{was compared to}} that of Final Fantasy VIIs protagonist Cloud Strife. She was criticized for her relative absence in XIII-2. Her role in Lightning Returns had a mixed reception: some critics saw her as underdeveloped and unlikable, while others found her better developed and more human <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> games. Lightning later appeared on lists, compiled by video game publications, of the best characters in the Final Fantasy series and in video games as a whole. She has been received favorably in polls of public opinion by Famitsu, Square Enix, and other organizations.|$|E
5|$|McDiarmid {{noticed that}} the script for Revenge of the Sith demanded more action from his {{character}} <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> films. Lightsaber combat was {{a challenge to the}} 60-year-old actor, who, like his costars, took fencing lessons. The close-up shots and non-acrobatic sequences of the duel between Palpatine and Mace Windu were performed by McDiarmid. Advanced fencing and acrobatic stunts were executed by McDiarmid's doubles, Michael Byrne, Sebastian Dickins, and Bob Bowles.|$|E
5|$|Poetic form is more {{flexible}} in modernist and post-modernist poetry, {{and continues to}} be less structured <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> literary eras. Many modern poets eschew recognisable structures or forms, and write in free verse. But poetry remains distinguished from prose by its form; some regard for basic formal structures of poetry will be found in even the best free verse, however much such structures may appear to have been ignored. Similarly, in the best poetry written in classic styles there will be departures from strict form for emphasis or effect.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{editions of}} the race have been decided with attacks on the Mur de Huy. The {{addition}} of the Côte de Cherave, however, added an unknown factor into the race: it was considered much more likely <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> years {{that a group of}} riders could break away from the peloton on the penultimate climb and hold an advantage to the finish line. No breakaway had won La Flèche Wallonne since 2003.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil – Code: Veronica {{features}} traditional survival horror gameplay {{found in}} most early Resident Evil games. This includes the series signature controls, interface, puzzles, as well as zombies and monsters to battle. Unlike previous games in the series which used pre-rendered backgrounds, Code: Veronica uses real-time 3D environments. Because of this, the camera is more dynamic <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> games. The camera will follow, pan, and zoom as the player navigates their character through the environment, similar to Capcom's own Dino Crisis (1999). The story is told through cinematic CGI sequences and in-game cutscenes.|$|E
5|$|The channel shared {{professional}} team coverage {{rights with}} some Detroit area broadcast television stations until {{the spring of}} 2008. In March 2008, the channel signed new long-term contracts with the Pistons, Red Wings and Tigers to broadcast more games <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> years, becoming the exclusive local home of all three teams {{for the first time}} until at least 2018. This leaves only the NFL's Detroit Lions as the only local professional sports team in Detroit to have all of its games on broadcast television.|$|E

The feeding habits of lesser black-backed gulls were studied in 1989, and it was shown that smaller clutches were laid <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> years and that supplementary feeding did not increase egg or clutch size.|$|E
5|$|The {{late nineteenth}} and early twentieth century demand for coffee and rubber led to Brazil's coffee economy and rubber boom. At the time, it was {{estimated}} that seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's coffee supply was grown in Brazil, particularly in São Paulo, Minas Geraes, and Rio de Janeiro. The resulting profits meant that the Brazilian government collected much more revenue <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> years. Simultaneously, there was an effort on the part of prominent Brazilian politicians, most notably Pinheiro Machado and Rio Branco, to have the country recognized as an international power. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal.|$|E
5|$|Under Neil Kinnock, Labour {{attempted}} to widen its electoral support from narrow class divisions. After Blair took the leadership, the party made significant gains in higher social classes and won 39% support from managers and administrators in the 1997 election, more <b>than</b> <b>in</b> <b>previous</b> elections {{that the party}} had lost. Labour won greater support among younger voters than older, {{but there was no}} significant gender difference. During the 1980s, much of Labour's support had retreated into industrial areas of the north; in 1997, Labour performed much better in the south of England.|$|E
