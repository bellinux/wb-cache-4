Mulder, sitting with Melissa in the hospital cafeteria, is asked by a woman for change for the cigarette machine. When she says that a pack of Morleys is already there and leaves, Mulder opens it and finds the Cigarette Smoking Man's address inside. Mulder bursts into the Cigarette Smoking Man's home and holds him at gunpoint, demanding to know why Scully was taken instead of him. The Cigarette Smoking Man claims he likes <b>the</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them, which is why she was returned; he reveals that he told Skinner it was Mulder who shot {{the man in the}} parking lot, although he didn't believe this to be true, incidentally revealing himself as unaware of who did shoot the man, namely X. He tells Mulder that he'll never know the truth if he kills him, and Mulder decides not to.|$|E
5|$|In early January 2015, Ranariddh {{expressed}} his intent {{to return to}} FUNCINPEC. At the party congress held on 19 January 2015, Ranariddh was reappointed as FUNCINPEC president, succeeding Arunrasmy who was appointed as its first vice-president, while Nhek Bun Chhay was appointed as second vice-president. However, rifts between Nhek Bun Chhay and Ranariddh quickly surfaced as <b>the</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them sparred with {{each other over the}} right to use the party stamp and the appointment of Say Hak as the party's secretary general. Ranariddh eventually gained the upper hand, and Say Hak's appointment was reaffirmed at another party congress held in March 2015. He also managed to convince party delegates present at the congress to adopt a new party logo. At the same time, Ranariddh appointed four more vice-presidents to the party's executive committee, namely You Hockry, Por Bun Sreu, Nuth Sokhom and Nhep Bun Chin.|$|E
5|$|Knowing that Angel {{has been}} cursed {{so that if}} he ever {{experiences}} pure happiness, he will once again lose his soul, Darla later returns and sleeps with him, but her plot fails; being with her only brings Angel despair, {{as well as providing}} him with a new understanding of his role as a champion. Their one-night stand leads to an unexpected development for <b>the</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them: Darla reappears in season three, pregnant with Angel's child, despite the fact that vampires cannot normally conceive. Her pregnancy allows Darla to experience emotions that had previously been lost to her {{in the presence of the}} human soul of her unborn child. Admitting that creating life with Angel was the only good thing they ever did together, Darla makes sure Angel will relay that to their child before she stakes herself through the heart, sacrificing her life so their son, Connor, can be born. Darla turns to dust, but the baby remains. Darla later appears as a spirit, trying to persuade her son in an effort to save him from the renegade deity Jasmine's manipulations, as the latter's actions are bringing Connor into the same dark path both Darla and Angel had taken.|$|E

When she spies on him outside his house, she sees Rush Limbaugh coming out, leading her to conclude that Limbaugh and Moore are in a gay relationship. However, Fox News refuses to allow any material against fellow conservative Limbaugh to be broadcast, leading Lois to realize that Brian was right about them. The two decide to take the story into their own hands and confront who they expect to be Moore and a naked Limbaugh in the same bedroom, only to discover that <b>the</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them are portrayed by Fred Savage, who has created bodysuits of them in order to continue his acting career.

25|$|The {{differences}} between the two models are the scale length (445mm of free string length in Lisboa guitars and 470mm in Coimbra guitars), body measurements, and other finer construction details. Overall, the Coimbra model is of simpler construction than the Lisboa model. Visually and most distinctively, the Lisboa model can easily be differentiated from the Coimbra model by its larger soundboard and the scroll ornament that usually adorns the tuning machine, in place of Coimbra's teardrop-shaped motif. Lisboa guitars usually employ a narrower neck profile as well. Both models have a very distinct timbre, the Lisboa model having a more bright and resonant sound, and the choice between <b>the</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them falls upon each player's preferences.|$|E
