They take care of themselves all the morning, and are ready for anything you want to do in the afternoon or evening. They have two children at home, but they never talk about them unless they are particularly asked to do so. They know a great many people, and you can <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they speak of them that they won't talk scandal about you. In fact, they are model guests, and they ought to open a school to teach the art of visiting." ...|$|E

They had been cut to shreds, and the right trouser leg was missing from the knee down. His shin was bloody. [...] "Moze took a lion along the rim, and I went after him with all my horse could do. I yelled for the boys, but they didn't come. Right here {{it is easy to}} go down, but below, where Moze started this lion, it was impossible to get over the rim. The lion lit straight out of the pinyons. I lost ground because of the thick brush and numerous trees. Then Moze doesn't bark often enough. He treed the lion twice. I could <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he opened up and bayed. The rascal coon-dog climbed the trees and chased the lion out. That's what Moze did! I got to an open space and saw him, and was coming up fine when he went down over a hollow which ran into the canyon. My horse tripped and fell, turning clear over with me before he threw me into the brush. I tore my clothes, and got this bruise, but wasn't much hurt. My horse is pretty lame." ...|$|E

The fact is, though it's private, and the others don't know it, he's a kind of an aristocrat, his father being a doctor, and you know what style that is-- in England, I mean, because in this country a doctor ain't so very much, even if he's that. But over there of course it's different. So this chap had a falling out with his father, and was pretty high strung, and just cut for this country, and the first {{he knew he had to}} get to work or starve. Well, he'd been to college, you see, and so he judged he was all right--did you say anything?" ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{were not}} long in {{preparing}} for this voyage; the chief difficulty was in bringing me to come into it. However, at last, nothing else offering, and as sitting still, to me especially, was the unhappiest part of life, I resolved on this voyage too, which we made very successfully, touching at Borneo and several other islands, and came home in about five months, when we sold our spices, with very great profit, to the Persian merchants, who carried them away to the Gulf. My friend, when we made up this account, smiled at me: [...] "Well, now," [...] said he, {{with a sort of}} friendly rebuke on my indolent temper, [...] "is not this better than walking about here, like a man with nothing to do, and spending our time in staring at the nonsense and ignorance of the Pagans?"--"Why, truly," [...] said I, [...] "my friend, I think it is, and I begin to be a convert to the principles of merchandising; but I must <b>tell</b> you, <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> you do not know what I am doing; for if I once conquer my backwardness, and embark heartily, old as I am, I shall harass you up and down the world till I tire you; for I shall pursue it so eagerly, I shall never let you lie still." ...|$|R
