25|$|The {{following}} day, Thursday, 9 May, Chamberlain {{attempted to}} form a National Coalition Government. In talks at Downing Street with Viscount Halifax and Churchill, he indicated that he was quite ready to resign if that was necessary for Labour to enter such a government. Attlee and Arthur Greenwood then joined the meeting, and when asked, they indicated that they must first consult their party (then in conference at Bournemouth), but it was unlikely they could serve in a government led by Chamberlain; <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> be able to serve under some other Conservative.|$|E
25|$|These were {{colourful}} and attractive, but low-market {{and only}} clockwork. <b>They</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> {{have failed in}} the marketplace because several established U.S. firms could undercut them and Hornby offered no better-class goods or electric models, but the Wall Street Crash precipitated matters. In late 1929, Meccano Ltd. sold its New Jersey factory to the A. C. Gilbert Company and Hornby trains had vanished from the U.S. market by 1930. The leftover inventory was sold in Canada and in the UK {{and some of the}} tooling was reused for products in other markets.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, the Soviet fleet {{had been}} growing, and outnumbered the U.S. fleet in every type except carriers, and the Navy {{calculated}} <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> be {{defeated by the}} Soviet Navy in a major conflict. This concern led the Reagan administration to set a goal for a 600-ship Navy, and by 1988 the fleet was at 588, although it declined again in subsequent years. The Iowa-class battleships , , Missouri, and [...] were reactivated after 40 years in storage, modernized, and made showy appearances off the shores of Lebanon and elsewhere. In 1987 and 1988, the United States Navy conducted various combat operations in the Persian Gulf against Iran, most notably Operation Praying Mantis, the largest surface-air naval battle since World War II.|$|E

500|$|To {{remove the}} sculptures of the Harpy Tomb the capstone, {{which may have}} weighed as much as twenty tons and was resting on the {{sculptured}} sides, had to be lifted off, causing {{the sides of the}} tomb to fall in. Fellows, who had left the sailors to carry out this task in their own way, remarked [...] "but the sculptured parts did not receive more injury than <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have done from a more scientific operation". [...] The sculptures of another monument at Xanthos, the Horse Tomb, were left in situ because they were so large that they could only be handled if first sawn into pieces. [...] This Fellows would have done, but the stone-sawyers arrived from Malta with Graves so late in the season that they immediately succumbed to malaria and the task was abandoned. [...] Nevertheless, 80 tons of material were put on board.|$|E
500|$|Christensen {{established}} the Odinist Fellowship in 1969, then based from her mobile home in Crystal River, Florida. The academic {{specialist in the}} far right Jeffrey Kaplan termed it [...] "the first organizational expression of racialist Odinism in the United States", while the religious studies scholar Stefanie von Schnurbein noted that Christensen created her version of Odinism as [...] "a discrete vehicle to establish her cultural pessimist, anti-Semitic, and radical racial agenda in a religious cloak". In 1971, her husband died, after which she began to focus more fully on her Odinist activities. She began touring North America to promote Odinism, and in August 1971 released {{the first issue of}} her own magazine, The Odinist, which opened with the banner of [...] "New Values from the Past". The Odinist focused heavily on right-wing issues, with Kaplan noting that commentaries on right-wing ideas, contemporary news, and anti-semitic ideas were [...] "regular fare" [...] within its pages, while explicit discussions of Odinist theology or Old Norse texts were [...] "few and far between". The Pagan journalist Margot Adler deemed The Odinist to be [...] "frankly racist, although <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have preferred the term 'racialist'." ...|$|E

This may have hampered the original investigation. Antisemitism is an aggravating circumstance (circonstance aggravante) in a murder case in France.|$|E

2500|$|John Baird, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada, {{welcomed the}} {{decision}} and praised {{the conduct of the}} referendum. The Premier of Quebec, Philippe Couillard, said that there were limited comparisons between Scotland and Quebec, where the sovereignty movement lost referendums in 1980 and 1995, and suggested a devolved model similar to federalism as a possible future model for the UK: [...] "I think that if the Scots had what we have, Quebecers within Canada, <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> be quite happy". Stéphane Bédard, leader of the Parti Québécois, described himself as [...] "disappointed" [...] by the result.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, Kevin D. Williamson, {{reviewing}} The Thomas Sowell Reader for Commentary, said [...] "If a mad scientist were {{to repair}} to his laboratory {{to design a}} machine that would make white liberals uncomfortable, that machine would be Thomas Sowell, whose input is data and whose output is socioeconomic criticism in several grades, ranging from bemused observation to thorough debunking to high-test scorn—all of which are represented in The Thomas Sowell Reader". Williamson says [...] "Thomas Sowell is that rarest of things among serious academics: plainspoken... His plain speaking also makes him dangerous, and that danger is intensified {{by the fact that}} Sowell is black. And not just black, but unassailably black: He's Southern-born, Harlem-raised, brought up poor, and the first of his family to be educated beyond the sixth grade... Because he is black, his opinions about race are controversial. If he were white, <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> be unpublishable. This is a rare case in which we are all beneficiaries of American racial hypocrisy. That he works in the special bubble of permissiveness extended by the liberal establishment to some conservatives who are black (in exchange for their being regarded as inauthentic, self-loathing, soulless race traitors) must be maddening to Sowell, even more so than it is for other notable black conservatives. It is plain that the core of his identity, his heart of hearts, is not that of a man who is black. It is that of a man who knows a whole lot more about things than you do and is intent on setting you straight, at length if necessary, if you'd only listen." ...|$|E

60|$|Behind {{that point}} of rocks a band of savages lay {{concealed}}, as Malone had rightly conjectured. There were about forty of them, all armed with clubs and spears, evidently bent on attacking the settlement. Of course they meant {{to do it by}} surprise, and had concealed themselves among the bushes behind the point, where <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have lain till nightfall if Brown-eyes in her wanderings had not discovered them. Their chief would have instantly caught and silenced the poor child, had she not run so far clear of the point that he would infallibly have revealed himself to Teddy Malone in doing so.|$|E
60|$|In the evening, {{he found}} the dinner-table laid for four, but they sat down only three. It was an {{appropriate}} occasion for Mr. Bounderby to discuss the flavour of the hap'orth of stewed eels he had purchased in the streets at eight years old; and also of the inferior water, specially used for laying the dust, with which he had washed down that repast. He likewise entertained his guest over the soup and fish, with the calculation that he (Bounderby) had eaten in his youth at least three horses {{under the guise of}} polonies and saveloys. These recitals, Jem, in a languid manner, received with 'charming!' every now and then; and <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have decided him to 'go in' for Jerusalem again to-morrow morning, had he been less curious respecting Louisa.|$|E

And yet <b>they,</b> <b>probably,</b> <b>would</b> have utterly declined the honour. They had but done that which was in the bond. They were but obeying orders after all. As Miss Yonge well says of all heroic persons: [...] "'I have but done that which it was my duty to do,' is the natural answer of those capable of such actions. They have been constrained to them by duty or pity; have never deemed it possible to act otherwise; and did not once think of themselves in the matter at all." ...|$|E

60|$|If {{we compare}} the {{fertility}} {{of the two}} legitimate unions taken together {{with that of the}} two illegitimate unions together, as judged by the proportional number of flowers which when fertilised in the two methods yielded capsules, the ratio is as 100 to 27; so that by this standard the present species is much more sterile than P. veris, when both species are illegitimately fertilised. If we judge of the relative fertility of the two kinds of unions by the average number of seeds per capsule, the ratio is as 100 to 75. But this latter number is probably much too high, as many of the seeds produced by the illegitimately fertilised long-styled flowers were so small that <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not have germinated, and ought not to have been counted. Several long-styled and short- styled plants were protected from the access of insects, and must have been spontaneously self-fertilised. They yielded altogether only six capsules, containing any seeds; and their average number was only 7.8 per capsule. Some, moreover, of these seeds were so small that they could hardly have germinated.|$|E
60|$|Naturalists {{frequently}} {{speak of}} the skull as formed of metamorphosed vertebrae; the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs; the stamens and pistils in flowers as metamorphosed leaves; but it would in most cases be more correct, as Professor Huxley has remarked, to speak of both skull and vertebrae, jaws and legs, etc., as having been metamorphosed, not one from the other, as they now exist, but from some common and simpler element. Most naturalists, however, use such language only in a metaphorical sense: they are far from meaning that during a long course of descent, primordial organs of any kind--vertebrae in the one case and legs in the other--have actually been converted into skulls or jaws. Yet so strong is the appearance of this having occurred that naturalists can hardly avoid employing language having this plain signification. According to the views here maintained, such language may be used literally; and the wonderful fact of the jaws, for instance, of a crab retaining numerous characters, which <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have retained through inheritance, if they had really been metamorphosed from true though extremely simple legs, is in part explained.|$|E
6000|$|It was two {{or three}} days before we got {{everything}} ready, and in our trips to the fort we saw {{a good deal of the}} Indians. We often met them in the town, too, for they were frequently allowed to go out and walk about by themselves. There was no danger, I suppose, of their trying to run away, for they were several thousand miles from their homes, and <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not care to run to any other place with no larger stock of the English language than one word, [...] "How?" [...] Some of them, however, could talk a little English. There was one big fellow--he was probably the largest of them all--who was called [...] "Maiden's Heart." [...] I couldn't see how his name fitted, for he looked like an out-and-out savage, and generally wore a grin that seemed wicked enough to frighten settlers out of his part of the country. But he may have had a tender spot, somewhere, which entitled him to his name, and he was certainly very willing to talk to us, to the extent of his ability, which was not very great. We managed, however, to have some interesting, though rather choppy, conversations.|$|E

They might drag him to gaol. <b>They</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> do so. He had an idea {{that he could not}} be admitted to bail if accused of forgery. But he would bear all that. If convicted he would bear the punishment, still hoping that an end might come. But how great was the chance that they might fail to convict him! As to the dead man's letter, and as to Dolly Longestaffe's letter, he did not think that any sufficient evidence could be found. The evidence as to the deeds by which Marie was to have released the property was indeed conclusive; but he believed that he might still recover those documents. For the present it must be his duty to do nothing,--when he should have recovered and destroyed those documents,--and to live before the eyes of men as though he feared nothing.|$|E

There were the strangers, sure enough, and what was more, there was the Abraham ahead of them, pushing for Cape South passage, might and main; for the strangers were on her heels, going four feet to her three. It appeared, afterwards, that the pirates, on quitting Rancocus Island, had stood off to the southward, until they reached to {{windward}} of the volcano, passing however a good bit to leeward of the island, on their first stretch, when, finding the Peak just dipping, they tacked to the northward and westward, and stood off towards the ordinary whaling-ground of the colony, ever which they swept in the expectation of capturing the brigs. The pirates had no occasion for oil, which <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> have destroyed in pure wantonness, but they were much in want of naval stores, cordage in particular, and the whaling gear of the two brigs {{would have been very}} acceptable to them. While running in for the group, after an unsuccessful search, they made the Abraham, and gave chase. That schooner steered for the straits, in the hope of finding the governor; but was so hard pressed by her pursuers, as to be glad to edge in for Cape South roads, intending to enter the group, and run for the Reef, if she could do no better.|$|E
