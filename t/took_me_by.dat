It'll be big, it'll probably be one of the bigger Beyoncé music videos ever done. And, I can say that I think the song is unbelievable. The Gaga thing <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> surprise, 'cause I've done videos for probably 15 years, and I had forgotten what it felt like to have a video premiere and have it be anticipated and have it explode. And yeah I hope the same for Beyoncé, but I don't know if that's gonna happen. It is a fantastic song, so I really hope that song catches for her, and I think the video's gonna be really fun and cool and different for her." ...|$|E
500|$|He also sings about a skull, a tombstone, a graveyard, and {{a scream}} {{in the night}} to {{convey a sense of}} foreboding. [...] The use of the homonym [...] "who do" [...] is an allusion to [...] "hoodoo", a Louisiana/Mississippi folk magic belief that events can be {{influenced}} by its use. [...] However, Bo Diddley uses imagery more common to the American Southwest, combined with exaggerated bravado. [...] He explained that the first line, [...] "I got forty-seven miles of barbed wire", came to him quickly, [...] "but I couldn't get a rhyme for it. [...] I thought of car tires and mule trains, and I couldn't get anything to fit. [...] Then one day I said 'use a cobra snake,' and my drummer, Clifton James, added 'for a necktie'". [...] These are directed at a female he is trying to woo – [...] "who do you love, me or him". [...] The lyrics confirm the effect: [...] "Arlene <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> my hand, she said 'oo-ee daddy I understand', who do you love?".|$|E

Unlike his previous albums, Stone co-produced with James Stroud, except on the track [...] "Dream High", which Stroud produced with Tom Bahler and Bruce Swedien. It also included different session musicians than his previous albums, such as guitarist Dann Huff and backing vocalist Curtis Wright. Its lead-off single was [...] "I Never Knew Love", which spent two weeks at No.2 on the country singles charts and accounted for his only entry on the Billboard Hot 100, where it peaked at No.81. The album's next two singles were the No.4 [...] "Addicted to a Dollar" [...] and the title track, which Stone wrote with Gary Burr, at No.6. Tom Roland of New Country magazine criticized the album for [...] "continu to mine the drippy side of Stone" [...] through [...] "manipulative" [...] ballads, but cited [...] "Addicted to a Dollar" [...] and [...] "Love, You <b>Took</b> <b>Me</b> <b>by</b> Surprise" [...] as being [...] "tougher" [...] than Stone's previous works.|$|E

500|$|After {{a two-month}} courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had {{met on the}} set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a {{relationship}} at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997). As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media. Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later. Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, [...] "It <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary but... I think it can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet." ...|$|E

Maxwell's lyrics concern his falling {{in and out of}} love during his sabbatical period prior to the album's release. In an interview with Pete Lewis of Blues & Soul, Maxwell stated [...] "The inspiration was real life itself. You know, while I was taking time away from the industry, I came across a relationship that <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> surprise." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dagmar left Copenhagen on 1 September 1866. Hans Christian Andersen, who had {{occasionally}} {{been invited}} to tell stories to Dagmar and her siblings when they were children, was among the crowd which flocked to the quay {{in order to see}} her off. The writer remarked in his diary, [...] "Yesterday, at the quay, while passing me by, she stopped and <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> the hand. My eyes were full of tears. What a poor child! Oh Lord, be kind and merciful to her! They say that there is a brilliant court in Saint Petersburg and the tsar's family is nice; still, she heads for an unfamiliar country, where people are different and religion is different and where she will have none of her former acquaintances by her side." ...|$|E
2500|$|The last film Coppola {{directed}} in the 90s, The Rainmaker, {{was based on}} the 1995 novel of the same name by John Grisham. An ensemble courtroom drama, the film was well received by critics, earning an 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert gave The Rainmaker three stars out of four, remarking: [...] "I have enjoyed several of the movies based on Grisham novels... but I've usually seen the storyteller's craft rather than the novelist's art being reflected. By keeping all of the little people in focus, Coppola shows the variety of a young lawyer's life, where every client is necessary and most of them need a lot more than a lawyer." [...] James Berardinelli also gave the film three stars out of four, saying that [...] "the intelligence and subtlety of The Rainmaker <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> surprise" [...] and that the film [...] "stands above any other filmed Grisham adaptation". Grisham said of the film, [...] "To me it's the best adaptation of any of ... I love the movie. It's so well done." [...] The film grossed about $45 million domestically. This would be more than the estimated production budget of $40 million, but a disappointment compared with previous films adapted from Grisham novels.|$|E
2500|$|In his Mishneh Torah, Maimonides {{detailed}} {{the laws of}} the fringes ( [...] , tzitzit) set forth in [...] Maimonides taught that the tassel on the fringes of a garment is called tzitzit, because it resembles the locks of hair on one's head, as [...] says, [...] "And he <b>took</b> <b>me</b> <b>by</b> the locks ( [...] , be-tzitzit) of my head." [...] The Torah does not set a fixed number of strands for the tassel. They take a strand of wool, called techelet, that is dyed sky-blue and wind it around the tassel. The Torah does not set a fixed number of times that this strand should be wound around the tassel. [...] which states, [...] "And you shall make tassels [...] [...] [...] and you shall place on the tassels of the corner a strand of techelet," [...] contains two commandments: (1) to make a tassel on the fringe of a four-cornered garment, and (2) to wind a strand of techelet around the tassel. The absence of techelet, however, does not prevent one from fulfilling the commandment with white strands, as a person who does not have techelet should make tzitzit from white strands alone. Whether the tzitzit a person wears on a garment are white, techelet, or a combination of the two, it is a single commandment, as [...] states, [...] "And they shall be tzitzit for you." [...] The presence of four tzitzit is necessary for the commandment to be fulfilled. Maimonides taught that tzitzit must be made by a Jew, as [...] says: [...] "Speak to the children of Israel [...] [...] [...] and you shall make tzitzit for yourselves." ...|$|E
