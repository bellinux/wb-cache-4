Despite dropping out of high school, he transformed himself into one of American television's most prominent journalists.|$|E

He added some new 3-D color footage and earned a writer's and director's credit for The Bellboy and the Playgirls, also a box-office failure. Coppola was hired as an assistant by Roger Corman and his first job for Corman was to dub and re-edit a Russian science fiction film, Nebo zovyot, which he turned into a sex-and-violence monster movie entitled Battle Beyond the Sun, released in 1962. Impressed by Coppola's perseverance and dedication, Corman hired him as dialogue director on Tower of London (1962), sound man for The Young Racers (1963) and associate producer of The Terror (1963).|$|E

25|$|On March 28, 2009, it was {{announced}} that Lopez would be hosting his own late night talk show on TBS. Lopez hosted a late-night talk show entitled Lopez Tonight on TBS Monday through Thursday at midnight Eastern Time. The show debuted in November 2009. In November 2010, the show moved back to midnight ET to accommodate a new show with former Tonight Show host Conan O'Brien. Lopez supported and even advocated for the move, making it different from the 2010 Tonight Show conflict that saw O'Brien depart NBC after a proposal to push Tonight back 30 minutes for Jay Leno to return to the 11:35p.m. slot. On August 10, 2011 Lopez received a cancellation notice from TBS. The network decided not to renew Lopez <b>Tonight</b> <b>for</b> a third season.|$|E
500|$|In late March, viewers started {{noticing that}} Jennings' voice sounded uncharacteristically gravelly and {{unhealthy}} during evening newscasts. On April 1, 2005, he anchored World News <b>Tonight</b> <b>for</b> the last time; his failing health also {{prevented him from}} covering the death and funeral of Pope John Paul II. On April 5, 2005, Jennings informed viewers through a taped message on World News Tonight {{that he had been}} diagnosed with lung cancer, and was starting chemotherapy treatment the following week. [...] "As some of you now know, I have learned {{in the last couple of}} days that I have lung cancer," [...] he said. [...] "Yes, I was a smoker until about 20 years ago, and I was weak and I smoked over 9/11. But whatever the reason, the news does slow you down a bit." [...] Although he stated his intention to continue anchoring whenever possible, the message was to be his last appearance on television.|$|E

2500|$|Chung briefly hosted her {{own show}} on CNN {{entitled}} Connie Chung <b>Tonight,</b> <b>for</b> {{which she was}} paid $2 million per year. Though her arrival at CNN was heavily hyped by the network, her show was panned by critics. CNN changed her show from live to tape-delay to improve its continuity. Although it performed moderately well in the ratings (a 500,000 increase in viewers), her show was suspended once the 2003 Iraq War began. During the war, she was reduced to reading hourly headlines. Once CNN resumed regular programming, Chung requested that CNN resume broadcasting her show as soon as possible. The network responded by cancelling it, even though her contract had not yet expired. In an interview, CNN founder Ted Turner called the show [...] "just awful." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 11 March 2013, Today Tonight aired {{a longer}} than usual 8-minute exposé on {{supposed}} [...] "cyber bully" [...] Tristan Barker, labelling him [...] "the world's nastiest man." [...] The story featured [...] "victim" [...] Jasmine Frost, who accused Tristan of cyberbullying, and told reporter David Eccleston she had received [...] "pictures of penises in the mail" [...] from Tristan and his followers. Approximately four hours after the story aired, a video was posted on YouTube by 'Facebeef' member [...] "Nebz Adlay", revealing Facebeef had constructed the entire story in order to trick Today Tonight. Frost appeared and revealed herself to be a longstanding member of Facebeef and the pair taunted Today <b>Tonight</b> <b>for</b> not conducting thorough research. The following day, Today Tonight released a statement admitting they were incorrect and called Jasmine an [...] "attention seeker". The stunt received nationwide news coverage.|$|E
2500|$|Paar {{came back}} to {{television}} {{on a regular basis}} beginning in January 1973, with Jack Paar Tonite which aired monthly as one of several rotating shows on ABC's Wide World of Entertainment. Paar noted that it was the most he was willing to appear, and that he would not have appeared at all unless ABC had committed to keeping Dick Cavett, one of his former writers, on the air. Paar's announcer for this series was comic actress Peggy Cass, and perhaps its most notable aspect was the national television debut of comic Freddie Prinze. Paar stayed on the show, which was in direct competition with <b>Tonight,</b> <b>for</b> one year before he quit. Dissatisfied with the one-week-per-month formula, he complained that even his own mother did not know when he was on. Paar later expressed discomfort with developments in the television media and once said he had trouble interviewing people dressed in [...] "overalls," [...] a reference to young rock acts.|$|E

Maltin is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for the world's shortest movie review; his two-star review of the 1948 musical Isn't It Romantic? consists of the word [...] "No". In 1985 he delivered a three-word movie review on Entertainment <b>Tonight</b> <b>for</b> that year's horror film spoof, Transylvania 6-5000. The review begins with a silent Maltin swaying to a recording of the Glenn Miller Orchestra playing [...] "Pennsylvania 6-5000", wherein the instrumental melody is interrupted by the sound of a telephone ringing (part of the original recording), after which the band chants the title of the song. In his review, Maltin timed it so that his review began with the phone ringing: [...] "Transylvania 6-5000 ... stinks!" ...|$|E

2500|$|Callas's {{relationship}} with La Scala had also started to become strained after the Edinburgh incident, and this effectively severed her major ties with her artistic home. Later in 1958, Callas and Rudolf Bing were in discussion about her {{season at the}} Met. She was scheduled to perform in Verdi's La traviata and in Macbeth, two very different operas which almost require totally different singers. Callas and the Met could not reach an agreement, and before the opening of Medea in Dallas, Bing sent a telegram to Callas terminating her contract. Headlines of [...] "Bing Fires Callas" [...] appeared in newspapers around the world. Nicola Rescigno later recalled, [...] "That night, {{she came to the}} theater, looking like an empress: she wore an ermine thing that draped to the floor, and she had every piece of jewellery she ever owned. And she said, 'You all know what's happened. <b>Tonight,</b> <b>for</b> me, is a very difficult night, and I will need the help of every one of you.'

During home visits, they travelled to London, England and sang Rihanna's [...] "We Found Love", their first song as a group, in front of their mentor Keating and guest mentors One Direction. Keating later selected them, along with Fourtunate and What About <b>Tonight,</b> <b>for</b> the live finals—a series of ten weekly live shows in which contestants are progressively eliminated by public vote. During the official launch for The X Factor at the Museum for Contemporary Art in Sydney on 13 September 2012, Keating announced that the group would be called The Collective.

2500|$|Harlan Ellison's {{original}} {{version of the}} teleplay won the annual Writers Guild of America Award for [...] Justman later said that the submission of the original unfilmed version was out of spite, and Roddenberry said {{in response to the}} victory [...] "many people would get prizes if they wrote scripts that budgeted out to three times the show's cost." [...] The WGA rules allow only the credited writers to submit scripts for consideration, who may submit whichever draft of theirs that they may choose. It was up against another Star Trek episode, nominated by the production team; [...] "The Return of the Archons". Coon reportedly said at the time: [...] "If Harlan wins, I'm going to die", and that [...] "there are two scripts up <b>tonight</b> <b>for</b> the Writers' Guild Award, and I wrote them both." [...] On the night, Roddenberry and several of the crew were seated at a table which Desilu had purchased, while Ellison was at another. When he won, the Star Trek party rose to their feet and applauded, since they believed it would bring credibility to the series. Herbert Franklin Solow later recalled that this elation turned to horror when Ellison began talking about the interference of studio executives in the writing process, before holding aloft a copy of the original script and yelling [...] "Remember, never let them rewrite you!" [...] Ellison walked past the Desilu table as he left the podium, and shook the copy of the script at Roddenberry and his party.|$|E

2500|$|In 1994, Jim Kaat was {{the lead}} analyst on Baseball <b>Tonight</b> <b>for</b> ESPN's {{coverage}} of Major League Baseball. In 1995, he {{was nominated for a}} New York Emmy Award for [...] "On Camera Achievement." [...] Also in , Kaat called the American League playoffs with Brent Musburger for ABC/The Baseball Network including the Yankees–Seattle Mariners Division Series. He served his second stint as an announcer for Yankees games on the MSG Network/YES Network (–), where his straight-shooting style was much in the mode of former Yankees broadcasters Tony Kubek and Bill White. Towards the end of his second stint with the Yankees, his workload decreased. In 2006, he only broadcast 65 games. Despite his decreased work load, Kaat won another Emmy for on-air achievement in 2006. In an on-air broadcast on September 10, [...] with booth partner Ken Singleton, Kaat acknowledged his plan to end his broadcasting career. His final appearance in the booth was to be a Yankee–Red Sox game on September 15, 2006 (Kaat was also set to throw out the first pitch). However, the game was postponed due to rain. Kaat later announced {{that he was going to}} record a special farewell message to the fans, but would not return for any additional broadcasts. However, the following day, Kaat did announce one full inning of the first game of Saturday September 16's doubleheader on Fox along with Tim McCarver and Josh Lewin. During that Fox telecast he was able to say goodbye to the Yankee fans, an opportunity that the previous night's rainout had deprived him of doing on the YES Network. In , Kaat joined the recently launched MLB Network as a color commentator for their Thursday Night Baseball series. Kaat also writes a weekly on-line blog for the Yankees (YES) Network, Kaat's Korner, and contributes video blogs and interviews regularly with national and international media outlets. One of the reasons he got back into regular broadcasting was because after his wife died, Tim McCarver and Elizabeth Schumacher, his friend and business manager, urged him to get back into the game. He also called Pool D in Puerto Rico for the 2009 World Baseball Classic games for an international feed.|$|E
