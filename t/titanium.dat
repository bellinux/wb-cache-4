5|$|Because <b>titanium</b> is non-ferromagnetic, {{patients}} with <b>titanium</b> implants {{can be safely}} examined with magnetic resonance imaging (convenient for long-term implants). Preparing <b>titanium</b> for implantation in the body involves subjecting it to a high-temperature plasma arc which removes the surface atoms, exposing fresh <b>titanium</b> that is instantly oxidized.|$|E
5|$|If C.P. <b>titanium</b> or a <b>titanium</b> alloy {{has more}} than 85% <b>titanium</b> content it will form a <b>titanium</b> biocompatable <b>titanium</b> oxide surface layer or veneer that {{encloses}} the other metals preventing them from contacting the bone.|$|E
5|$|<b>Titanium</b> powder is {{manufactured}} using a {{flow production}} {{process known as}} the Armstrong process {{that is similar to}} the batch production Hunter process. A stream of <b>titanium</b> tetrachloride gas is added to a stream of molten sodium metal; the products (sodium chloride salt and <b>titanium</b> particles) is filtered from the extra sodium. <b>Titanium</b> is then separated from the salt by water washing. Both sodium and chlorine are recycled to produce and process more <b>titanium</b> tetrachloride.|$|E
5|$|Vanadium stabilizes {{the beta}} form of <b>titanium</b> and {{increases}} the strength and temperature stability of <b>titanium.</b> Mixed with aluminium in <b>titanium</b> alloys, it is used in jet engines, high-speed airframes and dental implants. The most common alloy for seamless tubing is <b>Titanium</b> 3/2.5 containing 2.5% vanadium, the <b>titanium</b> alloy of choice in the aerospace, defense and bicycle industries. Another common alloy, primarily produced in sheets, is <b>Titanium</b> 6AL-4V, a <b>titanium</b> alloy with 6% aluminium and 4% vanadium.|$|E
5|$|Addition {{of boron}} nitride to silicon nitride {{ceramics}} improves the thermal shock {{resistance of the}} resulting material. For the same purpose, BN is added also to silicon nitride-alumina and <b>titanium</b> nitride-alumina ceramics. Other materials being reinforced with BN include alumina and zirconia, borosilicate glasses, glass ceramics, enamels, and composite ceramics with <b>titanium</b> boride-boron nitride, <b>titanium</b> boride-aluminium nitride-boron nitride, and silicon carbide-boron nitride composition.|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric {{passivation}} gives <b>titanium</b> excellent {{resistance to}} corrosion, almost equivalent to platinum. <b>Titanium</b> {{is capable of}} withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, chloride solutions, and most organic acids. However, <b>titanium</b> is corroded by concentrated acids. As indicated by its negative redox potential, <b>titanium</b> is thermodynamically a very reactive metal that burns in normal atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in a vacuum. At , it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>titanium</b> is {{resistant}} to corrosion by sea water, {{it is used}} to make propeller shafts, rigging, and heat exchangers in desalination plants; heater-chillers for salt water aquariums, fishing line and leader, and divers' knives. <b>Titanium</b> is used in the housings and components of ocean-deployed surveillance and monitoring devices for science and the military. The former Soviet Union developed techniques for making submarines with hulls of <b>titanium</b> alloys forging <b>titanium</b> in huge vacuum tubes.|$|E
5|$|Common <b>titanium</b> alloys {{are made}} by reduction. For example, cuprotitanium (rutile with copper added is reduced), ferrocarbon <b>titanium</b> (ilmenite reduced with coke in an {{electric}} furnace), and manganotitanium (rutile with manganese or manganese oxides) are reduced.|$|E
5|$|Some {{upmarket}} {{lightweight and}} corrosion-resistant tools, such as shovels and flashlights, {{are made of}} <b>titanium</b> or <b>titanium</b> alloys.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of <b>titanium</b> is about 4 picomolar in the ocean. At 100°C, the {{concentration of}} <b>titanium</b> in water {{is estimated to be}} less than 10−7 M at pH 7. The identity of <b>titanium</b> species in aqueous solution remains unknown because of its low solubility and the lack of sensitive spectroscopic methods, although only the 4+ oxidation state is stable in air. No evidence exists for a biological role, although rare organisms are known to accumulate high concentrations of <b>titanium.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{currently}} known {{processes for}} extracting <b>titanium</b> from its various ores are laborious and costly; {{it is not}} possible to reduce the ore by heating with carbon (as in iron smelting) because <b>titanium</b> combines with the carbon to produce <b>titanium</b> carbide. Pure metallic <b>titanium</b> (99.9%) was first prepared in 1910 by Matthew A. Hunter at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute by heating TiCl4 with sodium at 700–800°C under great pressure in a batch process known as the Hunter process. <b>Titanium</b> metal was not used outside the laboratory until 1932 when William Justin Kroll proved that it can be produced by reducing <b>titanium</b> tetrachloride (TiCl4) with calcium. Eight years later he refined this process with magnesium and even sodium in what became known as the Kroll process. Although research continues into more efficient and cheaper processes (e.g., FFC Cambridge, Armstrong), the Kroll process is still used for commercial production.|$|E
5|$|The fungal species Marasmius oreades and Hypholoma capnoides can bioconvert <b>titanium</b> in <b>titanium</b> {{polluted}} soils.|$|E
5|$|The most {{noteworthy}} {{reaction of}} TiCl4 is its easy hydrolysis, signaled by {{the release of}} hydrogen chloride {{and the formation of}} <b>titanium</b> oxides and oxychlorides, as described above for the production of TiO2. <b>Titanium</b> tetrachloride has been used to create naval smokescreens. The hydrogen chloride immediately absorbs water to form an aerosol of hydrochloric acid that efficiently scatter light. In addition, the highly refractive <b>titanium</b> dioxide is also an efficient light scatterer. This smoke is however corrosive.|$|E
5|$|<b>Titanium</b> alloys {{are used}} in {{spectacle}} frames that are rather expensive but highly durable, long lasting, light weight, and cause no skin allergies. Many backpackers use <b>titanium</b> equipment, including cookware, eating utensils, lanterns, and tent stakes. Though slightly more expensive than traditional steel or aluminium alternatives, <b>titanium</b> products can be significantly lighter without compromising strength. <b>Titanium</b> horseshoes are preferred to steel by farriers because it is lighter and more durable.|$|E
5|$|<b>Titanium</b> {{embrittlement}} from cadmium-plated tool residues {{resulted in}} banishment of those tools (and {{the implementation of}} routine tool testing to detect cadmium contamination) in the A-12/SR-71, U-2, and subsequent aircraft programs that use <b>titanium.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Titanium</b> has a {{minor use}} in {{dedicated}} non-circulating coins and medals. In 1999, Gibraltar released world's first <b>titanium</b> coin for the millennium celebration. The Gold Coast Titans, an Australian rugby league team, award a medal of pure <b>titanium</b> to their {{player of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Titanium</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ti and atomic number 22. It is a lustrous transition metal {{with a silver}} color, low density, and high strength. <b>Titanium</b> is resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine.|$|E
5|$|<b>Titanium</b> is {{non-toxic}} even {{in large}} doses {{and does not}} play any natural role inside the human body. An estimated quantity of 0.8 milligrams of <b>titanium</b> is ingested by humans each day, but most passes through without being absorbed in the tissues. It does, however, sometimes bio-accumulate in tissues that contain silica. One study indicates a possible connection between <b>titanium</b> and yellow nail syndrome. An unknown mechanism in plants may use <b>titanium</b> to stimulate the production of carbohydrates and encourage growth. This may explain why most plants contain about 1 part per million (ppm) of <b>titanium,</b> food plants have about 2 ppm, and horsetail and nettle contain up to 80 ppm.|$|E
5|$|<b>Titanium</b> is used {{in steel}} as an {{alloying}} element (ferro-titanium) to reduce grain size and as a deoxidizer, and in stainless steel to reduce carbon content. <b>Titanium</b> is often alloyed with aluminium (to refine grain size), vanadium, copper (to harden), iron, manganese, molybdenum, and other metals. <b>Titanium</b> mill products (sheet, plate, bar, wire, forgings, castings) find application in industrial, aerospace, recreational, and emerging markets. Powdered <b>titanium</b> {{is used in}} pyrotechnics {{as a source of}} bright-burning particles.|$|E
5|$|<b>Titanium</b> may be {{anodized}} to {{vary the}} thickness of the surface oxide layer, causing optical interference fringes and a variety of bright colors. With this coloration and chemical inertness, <b>titanium</b> is a popular metal for body piercing.|$|E
5|$|<b>Titanium</b> metal {{is used in}} {{automotive}} applications, {{particularly in}} automobile and motorcycle racing where low weight and high strength and rigidity are critical. The metal is generally too expensive for the general consumer market, though some late model Corvettes have been manufactured with <b>titanium</b> exhausts, and a Corvette Z06's LT4 supercharged engine uses lightweight, solid <b>titanium</b> intake valves for greater strength and resistance to heat.|$|E
5|$|<b>Titanium</b> {{tetrachloride}} (titanium(IV) chloride, TiCl4) is a colorless volatile liquid (commercial {{samples are}} yellowish) that, in air, hydrolyzes with spectacular emission of white clouds. Via the Kroll process, TiCl4 {{is produced in}} the conversion of <b>titanium</b> ores to <b>titanium</b> dioxide, e.g., for use in white paint. It is widely used in organic chemistry as a Lewis acid, for example in the Mukaiyama aldol condensation. In the van Arkel process, <b>titanium</b> tetraiodide (TiI4) is generated {{in the production of}} high purity <b>titanium</b> metal.|$|E
5|$|A more {{recently}} developed batch production method, the FFC Cambridge process, consumes <b>titanium</b> dioxide powder (a refined form of rutile) as feedstock and produces <b>titanium</b> metal, either powder or sponge. The process involves fewer steps than the Kroll process and takes less time. If mixed oxide powders are used, {{the product is}} an alloy.|$|E
5|$|About fifty {{grades of}} <b>titanium</b> and <b>titanium</b> alloys are {{designed}} and currently used, although {{only a couple}} of dozen are readily available commercially. The ASTM International recognizes 31 grades of <b>titanium</b> metal and alloys, of which Grades 1 through 4 are commercially pure (unalloyed). Those four vary in tensile strength as a function of oxygen content, with Grade 1 being the most ductile (lowest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.18%), and Grade 4 the least ductile (highest tensile strength with an oxygen content of 0.40%). The remaining grades are alloys, each designed for specific properties of ductility, strength, hardness, electrical resistivity, creep resistance, specific corrosion resistance, and combinations thereof.|$|E
5|$|As {{a powder}} {{or in the}} form of metal shavings, <b>titanium</b> metal poses a {{significant}} fire hazard and, when heated in air, an explosion hazard. Water and carbon dioxide are ineffective for extinguishing a <b>titanium</b> fire; Class D dry powder agents must be used instead.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{cannot be}} readily {{produced}} {{by reduction of}} its dioxide, <b>titanium</b> metal is obtained by reduction of TiCl4 with magnesium metal in the Kroll process. The complexity of this batch production in the Kroll process explains the relatively high market value of <b>titanium,</b> despite the Kroll process being less expensive than the Hunter process. To produce the TiCl4 required by the Kroll process, the dioxide is subjected to carbothermic reduction {{in the presence of}} chlorine. In this process, the chlorine gas is passed over a red-hot mixture of rutile or ilmenite in the presence of carbon. After extensive purification by fractional distillation, the TiCl4 is reduced with 800°C molten magnesium in an argon atmosphere. <b>Titanium</b> metal can be further purified by the van Arkel–de Boer process, which involves thermal decomposition of <b>titanium</b> tetraiodide.|$|E
5|$|Because of its durability, <b>titanium</b> {{has become}} more popular for {{designer}} jewelry (particularly, <b>titanium</b> rings). Its inertness makes it {{a good choice for}} those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools. <b>Titanium</b> is also alloyed with gold to produce an alloy that can be marketed as 24-carat gold because the 1% of alloyed Ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark. The resulting alloy is roughly the hardness of 14-carat gold and is more durable than pure 24-carat gold.|$|E
5|$|Because <b>titanium</b> is {{biocompatible}} (non-toxic and not {{rejected by}} the body), it has many medical uses, including surgical implements and implants, such as hip balls and sockets (joint replacement) and dental implants that can stay in place for up to 20 years. The <b>titanium</b> is often alloyed with about 4% aluminium or 6% Al and 4% vanadium.|$|E
5|$|Common titanium-containing {{minerals}} are anatase, brookite, ilmenite, perovskite, rutile, and titanite (sphene). Akaogiite is {{an extremely}} rare mineral consisting of <b>titanium</b> dioxide. Of these minerals, only rutile and ilmenite have economic importance, yet even they are difficult to find in high concentrations. About 6.0 and 0.7 million tonnes of those minerals were mined in 2011, respectively. Significant titanium-bearing ilmenite deposits exist in western Australia, Canada, China, India, Mozambique, New Zealand, Norway, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Ukraine. About 186,000 tonnes of <b>titanium</b> metal sponge were produced in 2011, mostly in China (60,000 t), Japan (56,000 t), Russia (40,000 t), United States (32,000 t) and Kazakhstan (20,700 t). Total reserves of <b>titanium</b> are estimated to exceed 600 million tonnes.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium {{is used in}} alloys with iron, <b>titanium,</b> niobium, tantalum, {{and other}} metals. An alloy used for liquid rocket {{thruster}} nozzles, for example the main engine of the Apollo Lunar Modules, is C103 which consists of 89% niobium, 10% hafnium and 1% <b>titanium.</b>|$|E
5|$|If the {{abundance}} of elements in Earth's crust is compared for <b>titanium,</b> zirconium and hafnium, {{the abundance}} decreases with increase of atomic mass. <b>Titanium</b> is the seventh most abundant metal in Earth's crust and has an abundance of 6320ppm, while zirconium has an abundance of 162ppm and hafnium has only an abundance of 3 ppm.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Union {{pioneered the}} use of <b>titanium</b> in {{military}} and submarine applications (Alfa class and Mike class) as part of programs related to the Cold War. Starting in the early 1950s, <b>titanium</b> came into use extensively in military aviation, particularly in high-performance jets, starting with aircraft such as the F-100 Super Sabre and Lockheed A-12 and SR-71.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the {{important}} role of <b>titanium</b> compounds as polymerization catalyst, compounds with Ti-C bonds have been intensively studied. The most common organotitanium complex is titanocene dichloride ((C5H5)2TiCl2). Related compounds include Tebbe's reagent and Petasis reagent. <b>Titanium</b> forms carbonyl complexes, e.g. (C5H5)2Ti(CO)2.|$|E
5|$|Recognizing the {{strategic}} importance of <b>titanium,</b> the U.S. Department of Defense supported early efforts of commercialization.|$|E
5|$|Rhenium diboride (ReB2) {{is a hard}} {{compound}} {{having the}} hardness {{similar to that of}} tungsten carbide, silicon carbide, <b>titanium</b> diboride or zirconium diboride.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{has many}} {{orthopedic}} applications. The material {{is also an}} alternative to PEEK (polyether ether ketone) and <b>titanium,</b> which are used for spinal fusion devices. It is silicon nitride’s hydrophilic, microtextured surface {{that contributes to the}} material's strength, durability and reliability compared to PEEK and <b>titanium.</b>|$|E
