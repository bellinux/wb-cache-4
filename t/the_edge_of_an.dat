5|$|Gorgosaurus {{lived in}} a lush {{floodplain}} environment along <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> inland sea. It was an apex predator, preying upon abundant ceratopsids and hadrosaurs. In some areas, Gorgosaurus coexisted with another tyrannosaurid, Daspletosaurus. Although these animals were roughly the same size, {{there is some evidence}} of niche differentiation between the two. Gorgosaurus is the best-represented tyrannosaurid in the fossil record, known from dozens of specimens. These plentiful remains have allowed scientists to investigate its ontogeny, life history and other aspects of its biology.|$|E
5|$|The Indians were {{a harder}} fight; {{they were out}} of the main field of battle, skirmishing on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{adjacent}} swamp. Richard Johnson eventually ordered a suicide squad of twenty men to ride forward and draw the Indians' fire, planning to charge with the rest as they reloaded. But the ground before the Indian position was too swampy to support many cavalry. Johnson had to order his men to dismount and hold until Shelby's infantry came up. But eventually they broke, and fled into the swamp, during which time Tecumseh was slain, some say by Johnson, others believing it was someone else.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from an {{isometric}} perspective, and the screen, which {{does not need to}} remain centered on the protagonist, can be scrolled with the mouse or the keyboard. Areas are revealed as they are explored by the player's characters. A fog of war effect hides explored areas when the player's characters move away from them. The player can also change the formation in which the party moves. Clicking an area exit, such as a doorway or staircase, causes another area to be loaded. Clicking on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> outside area causes the party to travel there; the game then presents the player with the World Map, from which the player may select a destination.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} of the lava domes suggests that they were formed by degassed magma {{left behind by the}} caldera-forming eruption. The pre-caldera lava domes were generated either directly from a common magma chamber or indirectly through secondary chambers. The lead isotope ratios are consistent with the volcano having formed at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> area of granite and rhyolite of Paleozoic age. Incapillo magmas probably formed as adakitic high-pressure mafic magmas derived from the crust, either directly by anatexis or indirectly by dragged-down crustal fragments. The magmas are then modified by crustal contamination and fractional crystallization. As the subducting slab shallowed, crustal garnet-containing lherzolite and granulite-eclogite, contributed both from the crustal basis and forearc rocks that were dragged down by the subducting slab, became an increasingly important component of erupted magmas. Eventually, the Incapillo magma chamber was disconnected from the mantle and lower crust.|$|E

The water depth never exceeded , and shallowed {{over time as}} bioherm detritus, and terrestrial sediments, filled the basin. Reef growth started in the Llandovery, when the sea was , and reefs continued to dominate the sedimentary record.

25|$|This {{computation}} {{using the}} induced EMF method {{is identical to}} the computation of the mutual impedance between two dipoles (with infinitesimal conductor radius) separated by the distance a. Because the field at or beyond <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> antenna's cylindrical conductor at a distance a is only dependent on the current distribution along the conductor, and not the radius of the conductor, that field is used to compute the mutual impedance between that filamentary antenna and the actual position of the conductor with a radius a. This then supplies the self-impedance of the conductor itself.|$|E

25|$|The hotel had 29 {{rooms and}} suites built on palafittes {{that were on}} <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> estuary. The rooms were named after Mexican lotería card riddles; each room was {{different}} and was themed and decorated inside according to its card name. To reach their rooms, guests had to use rowboats on a waterway, and raised a flagpole for means of communication. Morning coffee was given to guests after they pulled a rope from their room that erected a red flag. The absence of mobile phones and telephones was intended to bring an isolation experience. In addition, Hotelito Desconocido did not use electricity and was excluded from human settlements nearby. During the night, the hosts burnt candles, torches, and luminaries to light the hotel and pathways. The illumination of the moonlight was also an intended part of the night experience. Throughout the afternoon, guests were encouraged to horseback riding along the beach, biking through the palm trails, kayaking, playing volleyball, or billiards. There were also bird-watching and baby turtle release activities since the area had over 150 bird species and 3 different turtle species.|$|E
25|$|The 1985 Mexico City {{earthquake}} of September 19, 1985 is a {{good example}} of earthquake damage to a modern city built on soft sediment. Though the earthquake epicenter was located around 350km from the city, the sites with soft clay deposits exhibited a huge amplification of ground motion resulting in severe damage. Mexico City is built on a thick layer of soft soil over a hard stratum. The western part of the city is located on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old lakebed, whereas, soft clay deposits filling the former lakebed underline the eastern part. In the lake bed area, the soft clay deposits have shear wave velocities ranging from 40 to 90m/s and the underlying hard strata has a shear wave velocity in the range 500m/s or greater. During the earthquake of 1985, the seismic waves were trapped in the soft strata. The soft soil layer allowed the upward propagating shear waves to propagate easily; however, the hard strata at the bottom acted like a reflector and bounced back the downward propagating waves. This kind of trapping of waves created a resonance and consequently resulted in an enormous amplification of the ground motion. As a result, the lake bed area suffered catastrophic damage; however, in the southwest part of the city, ground motions were moderate and building damage was minor. The acceleration recorded in the hill-zones were relatively low-amplitude, short period ground motions compared to high amplitude and long period ground motions recorded at stations located in the lake zone.|$|E
25|$|Just {{two races}} after celebrating his second win of 1991, Waltrip would again be {{involved}} in another serious crash, again at the Daytona International Speedway, in Daytona Beach, Florida. It came after completing the 119th of 160 laps on the 2.5 mile superspeedway. Waltrip and driver Alan Kulwicki were racing side by side, leading a large grouping of cars, battling for 5th position. The car drafting Alan Kulwicki bumped the Kulwicki car, causing his car to hit Waltrip's Western Auto Chevrolet at speeds approaching 200mph on the long backstretch. Waltrip's car slowed and was collected by driver Joe Ruttman's car, both cars sliding sideways several hundred feet on the grassy infield. The tires of Waltrip's car clipped <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> access road causing it to become airborne and tumbling end over end several times before coming to a stop, up-side down, in a grassy area near turn 3. Waltrip was extricated and only suffered minor injuries but many feared {{that he could have}} re-injured his shattered leg from the crash at the same track the previous year. (Slow-motion video and still photography showed that Waltrip's left arm was outside the car as the car tumbled, and came to rest.) Waltrip still had a plate in his left leg from the compound fractures he suffered in the earlier crash at the Pepsi 400, at the Daytona International Speedway, (Waltrip commented on a January 10, 2013, SPEED Television broadcast of the Daytona NASCAR winter testing, that he had spent more time in the hospital from injuries suffered at the Daytona Speedway, than at any other track he had raced). Waltrip would compete in the following race, the summer race at the Pocono Raceway, in Long Pond, Pennsylvania, but was crashed again when driver Ernie Irvan spun driver Hut Stricklin, in front of almost the entire field. Waltrip won the year's spring race at the track just 5 weeks before.|$|E

500|$|After {{the loss}} of Crete, the 2nd New Zealand Division {{underwent}} a period of refit and training before it {{was assigned to the}} British Eighth Army, which was then engaged in the North African Campaign. It took part in Operation Crusader in November 1941 where the Eighth Army attempted to break through to Tobruk. [...] Hargest's brigade was used to cover the movements of the other two brigades of the division, which were attempting to advance through to Tobruk. In the meantime, Generalleutnant (lieutenant general) Erwin Rommel's Afrika Korps had outflanked the Allies and were approaching Hargest's position, which was clustered with transport that made defending an attack difficult. He and 700 men of his brigade were captured on 27 November 1941 when his headquarters, situated on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> airfield near Sidi Aziz, was overrun by German tanks. He had resisted moving his headquarters to a nearby escarpment and incorrectly insisted his orders did not allow him this latitude. After his capture he was taken to Rommel who, despite being irritated at Hargest's refusal to salute him, was complimentary of the fighting performance of the New Zealanders.|$|E
