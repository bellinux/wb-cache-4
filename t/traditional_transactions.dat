5000|$|Foreign {{exchange}} transactions {{can be traced}} back to the fourteenth Century in the UK, but the coming into being and development of foreign exchange derivatives market was in the 1970s with the historical background and economic environment. Firstly, after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, in 1976, IMF held a meeting in Jamaica and reached the Jamaica agreement. When floating exchange rate system replacing a fixed exchange rate system, many countries had gradually relaxed the control of interest rate and the risk of financial market increased. In order to reduce and avoid risks and achieve the purpose of hedging, modern financial derivatives came into being. Secondly, economic globalization promoted the globalization of financial activities and financial markets. After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, a large number of capitals flew across the world. Countries generally relaxed restrictions on domestic and foreign financial institutions and foreign investors. Changes in macroeconomic factors led to the market risk and the demand for foreign exchange derivatives market increasing further, what promoted the development of the derivatives market.Under such circumstances, financial institutions continue to create new financial tools to meet the needs of traders for avoiding the risk. Therefore, a large number of foreign exchange derivatives was widely used, making the foreign exchange market expanded from the <b>traditional</b> <b>transactions</b> market to the derivatives market, and develop rapidly.（Unknown,2012） ...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of the new {{generation}} of Internet-based technology, in particular Web Services, the automation of business activities that are distributed across multiple enterprises becomes possible. Business activities are different from <b>traditional</b> <b>transactions</b> in that they are typically asynchronous, loosely-coupled and long-running. Therefore, extended transaction protocols are needed to coordinate business activities that span multiple enterprises. Existing extended transaction protocols typically rely on compensating transactions to handle exceptional conditions. In this paper we identify a number of issues with compensation-based extended transaction protocols, and describe a reservation-based extended transaction protocol that addresses those issues. Moreover, we define a set of properties, analogous to the ACID properties of <b>traditional</b> <b>transactions,</b> that are more appropriate for business activities that span multiple enterprises. In addition, we compare our reservation protocol with other extended transaction protocols for coordinating business activities, and present performance analyses and results...|$|E

Further, current approaches are restricted to loop-free tasks. We propose a rigorous formal semantics for workflow computations and dependencies.

It is difficult to implement <b>traditional</b> <b>transaction</b> management techniques in a MDBS due to the heterogeneity and autonomy of the connected local sites. In this thesis, we present a new transaction execution model that captures the formalism and semantics of various extended transaction models and adopts them to a MDBS environment.

The execution model does not make any assumption regarding the concurrency control protocols executed at the local sites connected to the MDBS.
