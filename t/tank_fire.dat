5|$|The GUNT-Libyan {{alliance}} invested on 10 August the Faya-Largeau oasis, where Habré had entrenched {{himself with}} about 5,000 troops. Battered by {{multiple rocket launcher}} (MRL), artillery and <b>tank</b> <b>fire</b> and continuous airstrikes, the FANT's defensive line disintegrated when the GUNT launched the final assault, leaving 700 FANT troops on the ground. Habré escaped with the remnants of his army to the capital, without being pursued by the Libyans.|$|E
5|$|Artillery and 90mm <b>tank</b> <b>fire</b> {{destroyed}} {{seven more}} North Korean T-34 tanks, three more SU-76 towed guns, and several trucks and personnel carriers. This night battle, {{which was at}} times very intense, lasted about five hours. The US B Battery, 8th Field Artillery Battalion alone fired 1,661 105mm rounds, the 4.2-inch mortar platoon fired 902 rounds, the 81mm mortar platoon fired 1,200 rounds, and F Company, 27th Infantry fired 385 60mm mortar rounds. The North Korean column was completely destroyed. US patrols after daylight estimated the North Koreans had suffered 1,300 casualties in the fight. Eleven prisoners captured by the patrol said the action had decimated their units and that the division was only at 25 percent strength.|$|E
5|$|Early {{the next}} morning, September 3, the North Koreans heavily {{attacked}} Check's men {{in an effort}} to regain the ridge. Artillery, mortar, and <b>tank</b> <b>fire</b> barrages, and an air strike directed from the battalion command post, met this attack. Part of the battalion had to turn and fight toward its rear. After the attack had been repulsed hundreds of North Korean lay dead around the battalion position. A prisoner estimated that during September 2 and 3 the four North Korean battalions fighting Check's battalion had lost 1,000 men.|$|E

5|$|Heavy rains fell {{during the}} night of September 5-6 and mud slowed all wheeled and tracked {{vehicles}} in the withdrawal. The 1st Battalion completed its withdrawal without opposition. During its night march west, the 3rd Battalion column was joined several times by groups of North Korean soldiers who apparently thought {{it was one of}} their own columns moving south. They were made prisoners and taken along in the withdrawal. Nearing Waegwan at dawn, the battalion column was taken under North Korean mortar and T-34 <b>tank</b> <b>fire</b> after daybreak and sustained 18 casualties.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 1, 3rd Battalion, 38th Infantry moved in an attack westward from the 23rd Regiment command post near Mosan-ni to open {{the road to the}} 1st Battalion. On {{the second day of the}} {{fighting}} at the pass, the relief force broke through the roadblock with the help of air strikes and artillery and <b>tank</b> <b>fire.</b> The advanced elements of the battalion joined 1st Battalion at 17:00 September 2. That evening, North Koreans strongly attacked the 3rd Battalion, 38th Infantry, on Hill 209 north of the road and opposite 1st Battalion, driving one company from its position.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the {{incursion}} {{was expected}} to be heavy, but PAVN/NLF forces had begun moving westward two days before the advance began. By 3 May, MACV reported only eight Americans killed and 32 wounded, low casualties for such a large operation. There was only scattered and sporadic contact with delaying forces such as that experienced by elements of the U.S. 11th Armoured Cavalry three kilometers inside Cambodia. PAVN troops opened fire with small arms and rockets only to be blasted by <b>tank</b> <b>fire</b> and tactical airstrikes. When the smoke had cleared, 50 dead PAVN soldiers were counted on the battlefield while only two U.S. troops were killed during the action.|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{petroleum}} storage <b>tank</b> <b>fires</b> {{has gained a}} great deal of attention due to the high cost of petroleum, and the consequent disruption of petroleum production; therefore, much of the current research has focused on petroleum storage <b>tank</b> <b>fires.</b> Also, the number of petroleum <b>tank</b> <b>fires</b> is oscillating between 15 and 20 fires per year. About 33 % of all <b>tank</b> <b>fires</b> are attributed to lightning. Floating roof tanks (FRT’s) are especially vulnerable to lightning. To minimize the likelihood of a fire, the API RP 545 recommends three major modifications to floating roof tanks. This paper was inspired by a stroke of lightning that ignited a fire in a crude oil storage tank belonging to an Egyptian oil company, and is aimed at providing an efficient lightning protection system to the tank under study, in order to avoid the occurrence of such phenomena in the future and also, to give valuable recommendations to be applied to floating roof tank projects...|$|R

5|$|The 24th Infantry {{consistently}} captured Battle Mountain in {{the same}} way. Artillery, mortar, and <b>tank</b> <b>fire</b> raked the crest and air strikes employing napalm blanketed {{the top of the}} peak. Then, the infantry attacked from the hill beneath the east slope of the summit. Supporting mortars would set up a base of fire and kept the heights under barrage until the infantry had arrived at a point just short of the crest. The mortar fire then lifted and the infantry moved rapidly up the last stretch to the top, usually to find it abandoned by the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians, {{under heavy}} and {{effective}} {{fire from the}} Israelis inside the bunkers, ceased entering the fort. The Sa'iqa company to the east, under concentrated Israeli <b>tank</b> <b>fire</b> and aerial bombardment, was finally overwhelmed by the Israeli reinforcements, which proceeded towards the fort, opening fire on the main force. Consequently, all Egyptian forces east of the fort attempted to retreat through the marshes. The Israelis attempted to hamper the retreat by dropping smoke capsules over the area from four A-4 Skyhawks. The lack of visibility caused injuries as men tripped and were trampled during the retreat through the marshes.|$|E
5|$|American air, artillery, mortar, and <b>tank</b> <b>fire</b> now {{concentrated}} on Battle Mountain, and I and L Companies prepared another counterattack to retake it. This attack launched soon after, but made slow progress and at midnight it halted {{to wait for}} daylight. Shortly after dawn on August 22, I and L Companies resumed the attack. L Company moved up the mountain, with I Company supplying a base of fire. Three North Korean grenades wounded six of the troops, causing the rest to retreat without orders from their frustrated commander. They were eventually returned to the hill with some coercion. A few hours later, when a small North Korean force worked around its right flank, the company again withdrew back {{down the hill to}} I Company's position without orders.|$|E

5|$|Check's 1st Battalion was not {{attacked}} until 06:30 on July 24, {{shortly after}} daybreak {{in a heavy}} fog that allowed the North Koreans to approach {{very close to the}} US positions before they were observed. Two US infantry companies {{on either side of the}} road on low ridges held the forward positions. North Korean mortar fire fell on the men there, and then T-34 tanks appeared at the bend in the road and opened fire with their main cannons and machine guns as they approached. North Korean infantry followed the tanks. Although the two rifle companies stopped the North Korean infantry, the tanks penetrated their positions and fired into the battalion command post which was behind B Company. This <b>tank</b> <b>fire</b> destroyed several vehicles and killed the medical officer. A company commander knocked out one tank but was injured in the process.|$|E
5|$|North Koreans {{had also}} {{approached}} Yongsan from the south. The US 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company and tanks of the 72nd Tank Battalion opposed {{them in a}} sharp fight. In this action, Sergeant First Class Charles W. Turner of the Reconnaissance Company particularly distinguished himself. He mounted a tank, operated its exposed turret machine gun, and directed <b>tank</b> <b>fire</b> which reportedly destroyed seven North Korean machine guns. Turner and this tank came under heavy North Korean fire which shot away the tank's periscope and antennae and scored more than 50 hits on it. Turner, although wounded, remained on the tank until he was killed. That night North Korean soldiers crossed the low ground around Yongsan and entered the town from the south.|$|E
5|$|At 23:00 on August 29, the North Koreans {{attacked}} C Company again. Men on {{the left}} flank of the company position quickly abandoned their positions and soon the entire company was retreating, leaving the North Koreans in possession of the mountain again. Captain Lawrence M. Corcoran, the company commander, was left with only the 17 men in his command post, which included several wounded. All of those who stayed were later given Bronze Star Medals. After daylight on August 30, UN air strikes again came in on Battle Mountain, and US artillery, mortar, and <b>tank</b> <b>fire</b> from the valley concentrated on the North Korean-held peak. A wounded US soldier came down off the mountain where he had hidden for several hours while cut off from escape. He reported that {{the main body of}} the North Koreans had withdrawn to the wooded ridges west of the peak for better cover from the airstrikes, leaving only a small covering force on the mountain itself. At 11:00, B Company, which had to this point been the reserve unit, with the 3rd Battalion in support, attacked toward the heights and retook the top by 13:00. The poor defensive positions were repaired but logistical difficulties continued for the US troops at the top.|$|E

25|$|On {{the same}} day as the {{destruction}} of the Baghdad bureau of Al Jazeera, a U.S. <b>tank</b> <b>fired</b> a HEAT round at what the U.S. military later said was a suspected Iraqi forward artillery observer. Due to what the U.S. states was a communications error, the <b>tank</b> <b>fired</b> at the Palestine Hotel, where approximately 100 international reporters in Baghdad were based, instead of the correct building, killing two journalists, Taras Protsyuk of Reuters and Jose Couso of the Spanish network Telecinco and wounding three other correspondents.|$|R
25|$|A {{testimony}} describes {{attacks on}} an ambulance: When the ambulance arrived at al-Brazil {{to pick up}} a woman and her three wounded children, Israeli <b>tanks</b> <b>fired.</b> With bulldozers and tanks, the ambulance was surrounded. A bulldozer started to place sand barriers in front of the ambulance, while another bulldozer was demolishing houses and putting the ruins behind the ambulance to lock it in. When the medical workers tried to leave the car, Israeli <b>tanks</b> <b>fired.</b> After 3 hours, the army started to remove the barriers and the ambulance returned, without the wounded civilians.|$|R
5|$|Now {{the vanguard}} of the US Eighth Army, the British and Australians crossed the Taedong River using a sand-bag bridge at Pyongyang at noon on 21 October, moving north on the main highway to Sukchon with the task of {{reaching}} the Chongchon River. Meanwhile, elements of US 3/187 RCT occupied Yongju. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Nielson, 1 ASHR subsequently pushed up the road until fired upon by North Korean forces in the hills to the south of the town, with snipers engaging the column as it turned west out of the river valley around 16:00. Encountering only light resistance from a small North Korean force of approximately 75 men which was then scattered by <b>tank</b> <b>fire,</b> the Argylls successfully cleared the foothills by last light on 21 October. Approaching Yongju, Coad decided to halt for the night. The Argylls subsequently sent a patrol into the town, establishing initial contact with US 3/187 RCT, marrying up with K Company which was established in a number of houses on the northern edge of Yongju and on Hill 163 immediately above their position. A strong North Korean force was believed to be nearby, however, with at least 300 men thought to remain in the town.|$|E
5|$|On {{the line}} {{farther to the}} south, North Korean T-34 <b>tank</b> <b>fire</b> hit E Company at midnight. First Lieutenant Charles Ellis, the company commander, {{attempted}} to rally his men but they crumbled under fire, retreating without orders. During the night everyone in E Company ran off the hill except Ellis and 11 men. Several E Company men fled through a mine field they had set up and were killed. North Korean fire pinned Ellis' men down after dawn on September 1. When {{three or four of}} the group tried to escape, North Korean machine gun fire killed them. Ellis and the remaining men stayed in their foxholes on the hill for two days, repelling several attacks in that time. Ellis was then able to withdraw south, up the mountain to the 3rd Battalion's position. In his withdrawal, Ellis, discovering {{a man who had been}} injured earlier in a mine explosion, entered the mine field to rescue him.|$|E
5|$|One of A Company's platoons, {{under the}} command of Lieutenant Ray Bixler, faced most of the {{pressure}} of the North Korean assault. <b>Tank</b> <b>fire</b> had destroyed the American wire communications to their artillery, which began to fall on their own positions in the belief that they had been overrun with North Koreans, before Stephens was able to call it off. In the meantime, at 1135 Bixler's platoon was surrounded and destroyed, most of the men of the platoon were killed in their foxholes by the North Korean infantry. Following this, men on the right flank began deserting their positions regardless of Stephens' efforts to keep them there. Finally at 1205, Stephens ordered his men to withdraw. American forces had great difficulty retreating through the wet rice paddies, and a disorganized retreat followed as they attempted to pull back. During the retreat, several U.S. aircraft returned and, mistaking the soldiers of the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry for North Koreans, began to strafe them. The aircraft inflicted no casualties, but the battalion overall had suffered 20 percent casualties with 33 killed and 35 wounded during the engagement, as well as 14 killed in the mortar company.|$|E

5|$|The 44th Brigade {{encountered}} little opposition until {{coming under}} machine gun fire {{at a small}} stream, following which German resistance was much heavier. Between 0830 and 0930, the 6th Battalion, The Royal Scots Fusiliers and the 8th Battalion, The Royal Scots reached their initial objectives of Sainte Manvieu and La Gaule. After much hand to hand fighting they believed the villages to be captured just after midday, although they later found that some German remnants were holding out. Tanks and infantry from the 12th SS and the 21st Panzer divisions launched two counter-attacks to regain Sainte Manvieu but were repulsed {{with the aid of}} intensive artillery fire. The main German opposition in this section of their outpost line, had been from part of the I Battalion, 26th Panzergrenadier Regiment, which had been mostly overrun and the divisional pioneer battalion. The Germans in Rauray, which had not been captured the previous day, were able to subject the British brigades to observed artillery and indirect <b>tank</b> <b>fire,</b> causing considerable casualties and destruction, especially within the village of Cheux.|$|E
5|$|At {{first light}} {{the next morning}} Australian {{clearing}} patrols located 89 dead and 11 wounded Viet Cong {{in front of their}} positions. The bulk of the casualties had been inflicted by the Americans, but it was later determined that at least 17 Viet Cong had been killed by 1 RAR. Others had been disintegrated by artillery and <b>tank</b> <b>fire</b> and the battlefield was littered with shattered human remains, including severed limbs and chunks of flesh, while red pulp covered the rubber trees that were still standing. Later, 154 bodies were bulldozed into a B-52 bomb crater nearby, while it was estimated that a further 200 Viet Cong casualties had been removed from the battlefield. Fifteen Viet Cong had also been captured during the battle, as had a large quantity of equipment, including small arms and ammunition, crew-served weapons and grenades. The villagers of Ap Bo were again used by the Viet Cong to carry many of the dead and wounded from the battlefield with ox carts, and they also suffered a number of casualties from artillery and mortar fire landing in the area. In contrast, American casualties were limited, consisting of 11 killed and 72 wounded. Australian casualties were lighter still, with just two men wounded. One American tank had also been destroyed, while two tanks and four armoured personnel carriers were damaged. Overall, the commander of the combined US-Australian force believed that they had won an impressive victory, but his troops were exhausted and with ammunition running low, Glotzbach decided not to pursue the withdrawing force. Instead, the Americans and Australians focused on securing the battlefield and evacuating their own casualties.|$|E
5|$|Early on 15 July, the 1st Parachute Brigade heard <b>tank</b> <b>fire</b> to {{the south}} of their position. Brigadier Lathbury sent out a patrol to investigate, which located the tanks and {{infantry}} of XIII Corps that had halted just south of them the previous night. The 1st Parachute Brigade and 50th (Northumbrian) Division now moved forward together. The main dressing station, which had continued to operate after being captured, was liberated by the 2nd Parachute Battalion. In an attempt to recapture Primosole Bridge the 9th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry, supported by the 44th Royal Tank Regiment, carried out a number of assaults. At one stage they managed to cross the bridge, but three Sherman tanks accompanying them were knocked out by the German 88s, and with no armoured support the infantry were forced to withdraw. However, an error in communication caused the Fallschirmjäger Engineer Battalion to withdraw to the north bank of the river, and this allowed the Durhams to establish a position {{at the southern end of}} the bridge. At the main dressing station the surgeons had operated on another 14 wounded by the time ambulances arrived from XIII Corps at 17:00 to evacuate the wounded. At 18:00 the Main Dressing Station was closed and the men moved to Johnny I. During the time the main dressing station had been active, the surgeons had completed 31 operations, and the medics had treated 109 wounded.|$|E
