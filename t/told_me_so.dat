2500|$|For {{the seven}} years after she {{graduated}} college, Davis lived out of her car, which at first was her grandmother's Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera; she even built a bed in the backseat. She drove around to climbing areas, guiding and waiting tables to make ends meet, earning only about US$6,000 a year. She read throughout her journeys, from novels by Gabriel García Márquez to an autobiography by Kirstie Alley, to French short stories in the original language. Some of her favorite authors are T.C. Boyle, Victor Villasenor, and Rumi. Among her climbing heroes is Layton Kor. Her parents continued to disapprove of her lifestyle, however, and she felt very alone: [...] "My parents did not like my choices and thought I was doing stupid things with my life, and they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>so.</b> I didn't feel like anyone cared if I did a climb I was proud of. They were just like, 'Great. What about your future schooling?'" [...] As Davis became more well-known and successful at climbing, however, {{she was able to}} make a better living, particularly from sponsorships from major companies such as Patagonia, Five Ten, Clif Bar, and Black Diamond.|$|E

60|$|DONE. Small glass Kummel, please. Excellent carminative, these days. Anthony <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, there's Dick," [...] he said, [...] "he's shrewd; he {{saw through}} {{me the first}} time we met, and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> so--told <b>me</b> <b>so</b> to my face, which I had the virtue to keep. I bear you no malice for it, Dick; you were right; I am a humbug." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think it's charming here," [...] {{said the}} younger lady, evasively. [...] "Everything is so exquisitely clean. And {{the food is}} very good. Is this corn-bread--that you've <b>told</b> <b>me</b> about <b>so</b> much?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "These boys always fall in {{love with}} women older than themselves; I've noticed it so often. And he's almost <b>told</b> <b>me</b> in <b>so</b> many words, though I'm sure I've given him no encouragement." ...|$|R
60|$|It was a needless question, {{for a new}} desolation in {{the desolate}} house had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "But why? Complete your confidence, sir. Surely you cannot {{leave it}} there. Having <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> much, you must tell me all." ...|$|E
60|$|Sir John. What if Warner <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>so?</b> I hope you'll {{grant him}} to be a {{competent}} judge in such a business.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{would be}} more--more creditable to the family,' {{observed}} Slyme, with trembling lips. 'I wish you hadn't <b>told</b> <b>me</b> half <b>so</b> much. Less would have served your purpose. You might have kept it to yourself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So do I," [...] said Violet. [...] "And {{she is a}} dear ally of mine. We were a week {{together}} last winter, {{and swore}} an undying friendship. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> ever <b>so</b> much about Mr. Goesler." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't think I shall {{ever be able}} to ask her again; and I feel sure, if I do, {{that her}} answer will be the same. She <b>told</b> <b>me</b> in <b>so</b> many words; but never mind, I cannot repeat her words." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{came to my}} feet, scarce believing what I heard. Galeotto was Giovanni d'Anguissola--my father! And {{my heart}} had never <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>so!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you mean}} old Hobden the hedger, he's only seventy-two. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> himself,' said Dan. 'He's a {{intimate}} friend of ours.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Humphrey, {{this night}} we will visit that mighty American nation, {{of which you}} have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> much, and the other Neutral Countries." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With a cream-jug in my hand, or else sewing {{buttons on}} to a shirt-collar. But he never forgave {{me about the}} mutton broth. He <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> in <b>so</b> many words, that I was a--story-teller. And for the matter of that, my dear, so I was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Lilian, with a {{trace of}} coldness in her tone. [...] "You never <b>told</b> <b>me</b> quite <b>so</b> much before. My uncle is not always quite judicious {{in the way he}} sets about {{accomplishing}} his benevolent intentions. But the boat will soon be in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>so</b> many times," [...] said Fred. [...] "I think I {{must try}} to get to her. That passage, if it was not so very long! If Uncle Geoffrey comes on Saturday, I am sure he can manage to take me there." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{it was not}} vanity; it {{was only}} {{harmless}} delight in my admiration. I knew that very well, before she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "So you know--and {{you are not}} angry--your letters <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> much. I {{have loved}} you since {{that day in the}} beech wood, Isobel--Isobel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'They say it {{only means}} {{slipping}} and over-reaching in the mud, {{and they all}} 'ad enough of that to-day. Charlie <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> just now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> {{the truth}} <b>so</b> {{far as he}} knew it," [...] I rejoined. [...] "He really saw what he said he saw in the {{corridor}} at Gleninch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; Mary <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> I'm <b>so</b> glad of it. I {{always liked}} Dr Crofts very much. I have not congratulated her, because I didn't {{know whether it}} was a secret. But Crofts was there last night, and if it is a secret he didn't seem {{to be very careful about}} keeping it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is tyranny, sheer tyranny," [...] {{continued}} the other, [...] "and {{he will find}} that I am not the woman to yield to it. No. For love I could give up everything;--but nothing from fear. He has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> in <b>so</b> many words {{that he does not}} intend to go on with his engagement!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At last we are alone. My Elinor, {{you do not}} {{yet know}} all my happiness. Colonel Brandon loves Marianne. He has <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>so</b> himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But he did;--your papa <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>so,</b> and that's why {{he asked}} him to come down here again. He never would have done it without." ...|$|E
60|$|CATHERINE. But it was {{the bishop}} who <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>so.</b> He said a clergyman who breaks both ways is sure to get on in England.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why did {{you wish}} to bind him?" [...] the Arab asked coldly; [...] "you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that {{although}} <b>so</b> strong he was of a quiet disposition, and {{would make a good}} household slave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mind, {{no one has}} <b>told</b> <b>me</b> in <b>so</b> many words, but Mervyn Fulmort gave me such an {{examination}} on Randolf as men used to do when matrimony is in the wind; and since that, he inferred the engagement, {{when he came to}} me in no end of a rage, because my backwoodsman had conscientious scruples against partaking in their concoction of evil spirits.' ...|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time since we had fallen upon him did I see the man wince, and on the instant all my fears that we might have made a grievous mistake were dispelled, for I knew as well as if he had <b>told</b> <b>me</b> in <b>so</b> many words, that {{evidence}} would be found against him if the house was searched.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You lie!' almost shrieked he. 'I am {{the son of}} a noble {{citizen of}} Athens. Arsenius <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>so,</b> but this moment, with his own lips!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And Shamhaven will {{do almost}} {{anything}} for money--he once <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>so.</b> He took a sailor suit from a store in Manila without paying for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes,--if {{he wears}} stockings. I know he doesn't. He always wears socks. He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>so.</b> Whatever he has, I'll mend,--or make {{if he wants}} me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lord Rotherby knows it," [...] she {{informed}} him. [...] "He <b>told</b> <b>me</b> it was <b>so.</b> If--if you interfere in this, it--it may mean your ruin." [...] She {{came to him}} swiftly, a great fear written or her winsome face.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} trouble {{to try and}} fool me, Mr. Winfield," [...] he said tartly. [...] "I know everything. I have just seen my sister, and she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> herself in <b>so</b> many words that she {{intended}} to marry you." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{made the}} above {{discovery}} on the twenty-ninth of the month--anniversary of the Restoration of my royal predecessor {{in the field}} of human sympathies, Charles the Second. I had barely finished locking up my dispatch-box, when the ungrateful girl, whose reputation I have made, came into the room and <b>told</b> <b>me</b> in <b>so</b> many words that the business connection between us was for the present at an end.|$|R
