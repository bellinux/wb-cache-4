The aim {{of the project was}} the support of the design of microsystems with special attention to the <b>technology</b> <b>driven</b> aspects of the design. The <b>technology</b> <b>driven</b> design (design for manufacturing) support is until now only marginally available. Within the project a systematic analysis of the <b>technology</b> <b>driven</b> design was performed. It turns out that a lot of data is accumulated. Also most of the collected data is somehow related. Therefore the organized management of data is a key topic in the design of microsystems. Starting from this realization methods for data management were researched for adequacy. Among the methods known in computer science the relational database was selected. As a result a relational database scheme is presented. All collected data can be stored and related in a useful manner using this sche-me. Furthermore an extension of this scheme is presented that enhances it wit...|$|R

Especially manufacturing oriented SME will face the challenge to develop innovative <b>technology</b> <b>driven</b> business models alongside technology innovations in this field which will be essential for future competitiveness. Failing in developing these <b>technology</b> <b>driven</b> business models in an internationally highly competitive environment will have a serious impact both on companies and on the society. Hence, securing economic stability and success of these <b>technology</b> <b>driven</b> business models is an indispensable task. To identify challenges for innovative industrial internet business models first it is necessary to understand what the industrial internet means to the leading parties and applying companies and start-ups in the field. Second, challenges from general business model development will be outlined. In a third step risks and challenges in business model development will be discussed with regard to the special characteristics of <b>technology</b> <b>driven</b> business models {{in the context of the}} industrial internet and the important role of the technological key component of the business model. Especially the capability to deal with an integrated consideration of the indivisible linked dimensions of economic and technological aspects of these business models is questioned. In the fourth place the specific challenges for industrial internet business models are derived. On the basis of these results it is also discussed what might be done to handle these challenges successfully with the goal to turn them into chances. The need for future research on the integration of the risk management perspective into the development of these <b>technology</b> <b>driven</b> business models is derived. This will help established companies and start-ups to realize great technological innovations for the industrial internet in sound and successful innovative business models...|$|R
