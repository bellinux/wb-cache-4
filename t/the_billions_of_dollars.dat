Planalytics placed losses at $850million and IHS Global Insight estimated losses between $500million and $1billion. Although an estimate was not provided, AON Benfield placed losses in <b>the</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars,</b> noting similarities to the Blizzard of 1996 which inflicted $4.6billion in economic losses.

25|$|The {{economic}} losses affected everyone. Banks {{and insurance companies}} were mostly bankrupt. Confederate currency and bonds were worthless. <b>The</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> invested in slaves vanished. Most debts were also left behind. Most farms were intact but most had lost their horses, mules and cattle; fences and barns were in disrepair. Paskoff shows the loss of farm infrastructure {{was about the same}} whether or not fighting took place nearby. The loss of infrastructure and productive capacity meant that rural widows throughout the region faced not only the absence of able-bodied men, but a depleted stock of material resources that they could manage and operate themselves. During four years of warfare, disruption, and blockades, the South used up about half its capital stock. The North, by contrast, absorbed its material losses so effortlessly that it appeared richer {{at the end of the}} war than at the beginning.|$|E
25|$|Tourism {{became a}} major industry, {{especially}} in the Myrtle Beach area. With its semitropical climate, cheap land and low construction costs (because of low wages), the state became a developer's dream. Barrier islands, such as Kiawah and Hilton Head, were developed as retirement communities for wealthy outsiders. The state's attempts to manage coastal development in an orderly and environmentally sound manner have run afoul of federal court decisions. The U.S. Supreme Court (in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council) ruled that the state, in forbidding construction on threatened beachfront property, had, in effect, seized the plaintiff's property without due process of law. The rush to build upscale housing along the coast paid its price in <b>the</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> of losses as Hurricane Hugo swept through on September 21–22, 1989.
