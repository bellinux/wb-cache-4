5|$|Butterflies have {{appeared}} in art from 3500 years ago in ancient Egypt. In the ancient Mesoamerican city of Teotihuacan, the brilliantly coloured image of <b>the</b> <b>butterfly</b> was carved into many temples, buildings, jewellery, and emblazoned on incense burners. <b>The</b> <b>butterfly</b> was sometimes depicted with the maw of a jaguar, and some species {{were considered to be}} the reincarnations of the souls of dead warriors. The close association of butterflies with fire and warfare persisted into the Aztec civilisation; evidence of similar jaguar-butterfly images has been found among the Zapotec and Maya civilisations.|$|E

5|$|As {{discussed}} above, any non-pseudoforest graph contains as a subgraph a handcuff, {{figure 8}}, or theta graph; any handcuff or figure 8 graph may be contracted {{to form a}} butterfly graph (five-vertex figure 8), and any theta graph may be contracted to form a diamond graph (four-vertex theta graph), so any non-pseudoforest contains either a butterfly or a diamond as a minor, {{and these are the}} only minor-minimal non-pseudoforest graphs. Thus, a graph is a pseudoforest if and only if it does not have <b>the</b> <b>butterfly</b> or the diamond as a minor. If one forbids only the diamond but not <b>the</b> <b>butterfly,</b> the resulting larger graph family consists of the cactus graphs and disjoint unions of multiple cactus graphs.|$|E

Starting on January 11, 1998 the tour spanned five shows in Asia, six in Australia, and one in Hawaii, US.

5|$|Chemical {{communications}} in animals {{rely on a}} variety of aspects including taste and smell. Chemoreception is the physiological response of a sense organ (i.e. taste or smell) to a chemical stimulus where the chemicals act as signals to regulate the state or activity of a cell. A semiochemical is a message-carrying chemical that is meant to attract, repel, and convey information. Types of semiochemicals include pheromones and kairomones. One example is <b>the</b> <b>butterfly</b> Phengaris arion which uses chemical signals as a form of mimicry to aid in predation.|$|E

5|$|Collecting {{butterflies}} {{was once}} a popular hobby; it has now largely been replaced by photography, recording, and rearing butterflies for release into the wild. The zoological illustrator Frederick William Frohawk succeeded in rearing all <b>the</b> <b>butterfly</b> species found in Britain, {{at a rate of}} four per year, to enable him to draw every stage of each species. He published the results in the folio sized handbook The Natural History of British Butterflies in 1924.|$|E
