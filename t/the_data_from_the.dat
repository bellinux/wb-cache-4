5|$|Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory {{think that}} Voyager 1 entered the {{termination}} shock in February 2003. This marks {{the point where}} the solar wind slows down to subsonic speeds. Some other scientists expressed doubt, discussed in the journal Nature of November 6, 2003. The issue would not be resolved until other data became available, since Voyager 1s solar-wind detector ceased functioning in 1990. This failure meant that termination shock detection would have to be inferred from <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other instruments on board.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, {{provided}} a comprehensive coverage of Jupiter's magnetic field near the equatorial plane at distances up to 100RJ. The regions studied included the magnetotail and the dawn and dusk {{sectors of the}} magnetosphere. While Galileo successfully survived in the harsh radiation environment of Jupiter, it still experienced a few technical problems. In particular, the spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors. Several times electrical arcs occurred between rotating and non-rotating parts of the spacecraft, causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileo's ultra-stable quartz oscillator.|$|E

5|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{remastering}} {{work was}} outsourced to the Shanghai-based studio Virtuos. Square Enix's internal staff was responsible for reassembling the original assets, and helped with a part of redoing the high-definition data. Among the returning original team members were Motomu Toriyama, Yusuke Naora, Toshitaka Matsuda and Masaki Kobayashi who supervised the production. X-2 art director Shintaro Takai remained in the same role for both remastered games. The Chinese side of development was headed by managing director Pan Feng. The team encountered problems in porting the games to PlayStation 3 and Vita as their graphics used many functionalities unique to the PlayStation 2 hardware. The loss and repair {{of some of the}} original assets posed another hurdle, with Kitase commenting that it might have been easier to recreate <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ground up.|$|E

He quoted that “Population is our most valuable resource and we can only take stock of it through an activity like the census. We now have the data, therefore, the challenge remains with all of us to ensure it is put into good use by making informed decisions for our people,”. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) helped the Government of Zambia, especially the Child Welfare Ministry to update <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Living Condition Monitoring Survey (LCMS) and data on all key performance indicators of the National Development Plan (ZNDP) during 2013.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} the command {{sequence}} to be relayed to the spacecraft and the calculations for each photograph's exposure time were developed by space scientists Candy Hansen of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and Carolyn Porco of the University of Arizona. After the planned imaging sequence was taken on February 14, 1990, <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> camera was stored initially in an on-board tape recorder. Transmission to Earth was also delayed by the Magellan and Galileo missions being given priority {{over the use of}} the Deep Space Network. Then, between March and May 1990, Voyager 1 returned 60 frames back to Earth, with the radio signal travelling {{at the speed of light}} for nearly five and a half hours to cover the distance.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigators}} also {{requested that}} Fokker conduct {{a study of}} the effects of ice contamination and pilot technique on the F28 aircraft. The NTSB evaluated <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> tests and found that the pilot initiated the rotation five knots earlier at 119 knots instead of the proper rotation speed of 124 knots. The data from Fokker was correlated with the cockpit voice recording and confirmed that the first officer called a rotation speed of 113 knots but the captain did not rotate until 119 knots. It was never established why the rotation was called and initiated earlier than was standard.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{performance}} of an SSD {{is dependent upon}} a number of factors, including write amplification. Writing to a flash memory device takes longer than reading from it. An SSD generally uses multiple flash memory components connected in parallel to increase performance. If the SSD has a high write amplification, the controller {{will be required to}} write that many more times to the flash memory. This requires even more time to write <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> host. An SSD with a low write amplification will not need to write as much data and can therefore be finished writing sooner than a drive with a high write amplification.|$|E

5|$|Transit {{observations}} in 1874 and 1882 allowed this value to be refined further. Three expeditions—from Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States—were {{sent to the}} Kerguelen Archipelago for the 1874 observations. The American astronomer Simon Newcomb combined <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> last four transits, and he arrived at a value of about 149.59 million kilometers (±0.31 million kilometers). Modern techniques, {{such as the use}} of radio telemetry from space probes, and of radar measurements of the distances to planets and asteroids in the Solar System, have allowed a reasonably accurate value for the astronomical unit (AU) to be calculated to a precision of about ±30 meters. As a result, the need for parallax calculations has been superseded.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major issue}} {{is the amount of}} {{radiation}} to which a space probe is subjected, due to the harsh charged-particle environment around Jupiter (for a detailed explanation see Magnetosphere of Jupiter). For example, when Pioneer 11 made its closest approach to the planet, the level of radiation was ten times more powerful than Pioneers designers had predicted, leading to fears that the probes would not survive. With a few minor glitches, the probe managed to pass through the radiation belts, but it lost most of the images of the moon Io, as the radiation had caused Pioneers imaging photo polarimeter to receive false commands. The subsequent and far more technologically advanced Voyager spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with the radiation levels. Over the eight years the Galileo spacecraft orbited the planet, the probe's radiation dose far exceeded its design specifications, and its systems failed on several occasions. The spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors, and electrical arcs sometimes occurred between its rotating and non-rotating parts, causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileos ultra-stable quartz oscillator.|$|E
5|$|In late September 1996, a {{cold front}} stalled over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, {{producing}} {{an area of}} convection. The thunderstorms were possibly related to the same tropical wave that spawned Hurricane Hernan in the eastern Pacific Ocean. A low pressure area formed in the Bay of Campeche by October2, although initially upper-level conditions did not favor tropical cyclogenesis. The convection became more persistent on October3 and gradually became better organized. On October4, classifications based on the Dvorak technique began, and later that day the Hurricane Hunters flew into the system. Based on <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> flight, {{it is estimated that}} Tropical Depression Ten formed at 1800UTC that day off the northeast coast of Mexico. During its formative stages, the depression interacted with a ridge near the Great Lakes to produce strong winds across the Gulf Coast of the United States. With weak steering currents, the depression moved slowly to the northeast, and initially, wind shear prevented further organization. On October6, a strong trough caused the system to accelerate to the east-northeast. The storm's west to east motion across the Gulf of Mexico was unusual although not unprecedented.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Adam {{discovers that}} he can gain access to {{information}} about Earth's future. He has an information port installed in his brain and uses Rose's phone to call his answering machine at home and transfer data to it. The port also allows the Jagrafess into Adam's mind. The Jagrafess discovers {{the true nature of}} the Doctor and makes plans to kill him. The Doctor, aware of Cathica's presence outside the room, loudly comments on how altering the environmental systems will likely kill the Jagrafess. Cathica takes the hint and reverses the cooling system, causing Floor 500 to overheat and killing the Jagrafess and the Editor. As the humans on board the station and on Earth come to wake from the stupor they've been in, the Doctor congratulates Cathica and gives her hope for the future. The Doctor discovers Adam's duplicity and takes him to his home on Earth. The Doctor destroys the answering machine with <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> future on it and tells Adam he is no longer welcome in the TARDIS. Adam tries to plead with the Doctor and Rose, saying that they can't just leave him to walk around with a port to his brain for the rest of his life, but the Doctor tells him that if he just leads a quiet life, it probably won't be discovered. But as soon as the Doctor and Rose leave, Adam's mother returns home and, by pure accident and much to her shock, activates his brain port.|$|E
5|$|The sum {{argument}} {{advanced by}} the JWP in {{the approval of}} the discovery of nihonium was later criticized in a May 2016 study from Lund University and the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, as it is only valid if no gamma decay or internal conversion takes place along the decay chain, which is not likely for odd nuclei, and the uncertainty of the alpha decay energies measured in the 278Nh decay chain was not small enough to rule out this possibility; and if this is the case, similarity in lifetimes of intermediate daughters become a meaningless argument, as different isomers of the same nuclide can have wildly different half-lives (the ground state of 180Ta has a half-life of mere hours, but an excited state 180mTa has never been observed to decay). However, although this study found reason to doubt and criticize the IUPAC approval of the discoveries of moscovium and tennessine, the data from RIKEN for nihonium was found to be congruent, and <b>the</b> <b>data</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Dubna team for moscovium and nihonium to probably be so, thus necessitating no criticism of the IUPAC approval of the discovery of element 113.|$|E
