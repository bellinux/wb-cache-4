50|$|On the {{continent}} of Seanchan, Aes Sedai set themselves up as local governors and rulers rather than establishing a single, united order. During the conquest of Seanchan by the armies of Luthair Paendrag, these Aes Sedai were turned against each other and a device called an a'dam, able to imprison women who can channel, was invented. Aes Sedai on {{the continent}} were eventually rendered extinct by Luthair Paendrag's successors, and Aes Sedai are outlawed in the Seanchan Empire. Instead, all women are <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to channel at a young age. Those who can channel are made damane and leashed with a'dam, while those who can learn to channel are made sul'dam, who control the damane using a'dam. The Seanchan themselves are unaware that sul'dam can learn to channel, and it is speculated within the series that, if that discovery were to be made, Seanchan society might suddenly collapse. Men and women who cannot channel are unable to control damane by a'dam, while men who can channel or learn to channel feel great pain upon contact with a'dam, and may die.|$|E

A complete video segmentation system must achieve good performance on special effect edit detection also. In this paper, we discuss the performance of our VideoTrails based algorithms with other existing special effect edit detection algorithms in literature.

The quality of the strain image produced by displacement estimation algorithms are heavily influenced by the RF echo data recorded by different ultrasound systems.

40|$|Receptor-mediated {{endocytosis}} {{and recycling}} are inhibited in mitotic mammalian cells, and {{previous studies have}} shown that inhibition of endocytic vesicle fusion in vitro occurs via cyclin B-cdc 2 kinase. To <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of cyclin A-cdc 2 kinase to inhibit endocytic vesicle fusion, we employed recombinant cyclin A proteins. Addition of cyclin A to interphase extracts activated a histone kinase and markedly reduced the efficiency of endocytic vesicle fusion. By a number of criteria, inhibition of fusion was shown to be due to the action of cyclin A, via the mitosis-specific cdc 2 kinase, and not an indirect effect through cyclin B. Two-stage incubations were used to demonstrate that at least one target of cyclin A-cdc 2 kinase is a cytosolic component of the fusion apparatus. Reconstitution experiments showed that this component was also modified in mitotic cytosols and was unaffected by N-ethyl maleimide treatment...|$|R

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} to <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of Escherichia coli to adhere to isolated intestinal epithelial cells. Of the E. coli tested, those having either K 88 ac or K 88 ab antigens adhered to the cells, and those which did not have these antigens did not.

None of the E. coli enteropathogens of cattle tested adhered to either pig or cattle cells. Similarly, human strains did not adhere to pig cells. Although the test system may not have been ideal for human or bovine E. coli, the results reported here suggest that adhesiveness is a property limited to porcine enteropathogenic E. coli carrying one of the K 88 antigens.

40|$|Euglena are {{photosynthetic}} unicellular protozoa. Commonly {{found in}} rivers, lakes and ponds, some Euglena {{are found in}} toxic environments, like areas of acid mine drainage where they can grow at low pH and {{in the presence of}} heavy metals and metalloids such as arsenite (e. g.

The goal of this research is to determine if an Idaho Euglena isolate (SG 6) belongs to the E. mutabilis species and to compare it’s level of arsenite resistance with other E. mutabilis strains. As part of the methodology, we have developed microtiter plate assays in which the cells are grown in liquid or on 1 % agar solid media; this allows microscopic observation and direct cell counting. To determine SG 6 ’s relation to known E. mutabilis, DNA and RNA are isolated to obtain sequence from multiple nuclear and chloroplast genes. Lastly, as preliminary experiments suggest, if SG 6 represents a new strain of E. mutabilis that is abnormally sensitive to arsenite, we will <b>test</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of SG 6 to gradually adapt to a more toxic environment and become arsenite resistant...|$|R

All atoxigenic strains reduced contamination when inoculated into developing bolls 24 h prior to the toxigenic strain. However, only one strain, AF 36, was highly effective when inoculated simultaneously with the toxigenic strain. All five strains were able to inhibit aflatoxin production by the toxigenic strain in liquid fermentation. Thus, in vitro activity did not predict <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of an atoxigenic strain to prevent contamination of developing bolls. Therefore, strain selection for competitive exclusion to prevent aflatoxin contamination should include evaluation of efficacy in developing crops prior to field release. Atoxigenic strains were also characterized by <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> to convert several aflatoxin precursors into aflatoxin B 1. Four atoxigenic strains failed to convert any of the aflatoxin biosynthetic precursors to aflatoxins.

After crossing the collection of 2296 EP lines to the ey-GAL 4 driver, we identified 46 lines, corresponding to insertions in 32 different loci, that elicited a small eye phenotype. These lines were classified further by <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> an effect in postmitotic cells using the sev-GAL 4 driver, by <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> an effect in the wing using en-GAL 4, and by <b>testing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> of overexpression of cycE to rescue the small eye phenotype.
