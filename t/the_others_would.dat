5|$|A typical Nike-X {{deployment}} {{around a}} major city would have consisted of several missile batteries. One of these would be equipped with the MAR and its associated DCDP computers, while <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>would</b> optionally have an MSR. The sites were all networked together using communications equipment working at normal voice bandwidths. Some of the smaller bases would be built north of the MAR to provide protection to this central station.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Yojimbo, Kurosawa found himself under {{pressure}} from Toho to create a sequel. Kurosawa turned to a script he had written before Yojimbo, reworking it to include the hero of his previous film. Sanjuro {{was the first of}} three Kurosawa films to be adapted from the work of the writer Shūgorō Yamamoto (<b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>would</b> be Red Beard and Dodeskaden). It is lighter in tone and closer to a conventional period film than Yojimbo, though its story of a power struggle within a samurai clan is portrayed with strongly comic undertones. The film opened on January 1, 1962, quickly surpassing Yojimbos box office success and garnering positive reviews.|$|E

25|$|Finally, he {{followed}} the serpent to lake in the mountains. He watched and saw that, while one of the serpents two heads would be awake during daylight, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>would</b> sleep. Then during night, they <b>would</b> switch and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>would</b> stay awake. Training and sacrificing more, Xwechtáal prayed for the answer to defeat the dreaded two-headed serpent. Then one night he had a vision.|$|R

5|$|The conspirators practiced {{different}} ways of murdering Turner. According to informant statements to law enforcement, one of the conspirators was to pretend there was car trouble, and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>would</b> then approach Turner with their guns. Informants later told law enforcement officials that the conspirators intended to hide out at an international network of Rajneesh communes if the plan was successful. According to The Oregonian the assassinations were not carried out because Ma Anand Sheela became distracted by political power plays within the Rajneesh commune {{and other members of}} the organization who were trying to remove her from her position within the group. And according to witness information, Ma Anand Sheela was persuaded not to carry out this action through conversations with Carol Matthews, who stated to her that this was not a solution in any way and would be a horrendous action.|$|E

25|$|The most {{beautiful}} woman in the world was Helen, one of the daughters of Tyndareus, King of Sparta. Her mother was Leda, who had been either raped or seduced by Zeus {{in the form of a}} swan. Accounts differ over which of Leda's four children, two pairs of twins, were fathered by Zeus and which by Tyndareus. However, Helen is usually credited as Zeus' daughter, and sometimes Nemesis is credited as her mother. Helen had scores of suitors, and her father was unwilling to choose one for fear <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>would</b> retaliate violently.|$|E
25|$|IDF Lieutenant-General Gabi Ashkenazi {{testified to}} Israel's Turkel Commission that the IDF had fired 308 live rounds and about 350 bean bag rounds and paintballs. An aide {{to the general}} said that 70 of these shots were aimed to cause injury, while <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>would</b> have been warning shots. IDF Major-General Giora Eiland said that the IDF had found {{evidence}} of four instances of soldiers coming under fire from activists, and that {{in at least one}} case, the fire came from weapons that were not stolen from commandos.|$|E
25|$|Only one chalice from 1422, {{preserved}} until today, {{remained with}} the convent. On 23November/ 3December 1629O.S./N.S. the subdelegates returned to Himmelpforten and interrogated the conventuals as to alienations of convent possessions, but without learning anything new. Then the conventuals {{were ordered to}} the abbey quire to acknowledge the seizure of the convent by the Restitution Commission. They were told, that those who would convert to Catholicism until Christmas 1629, would be granted a lifelong annuity, whereas <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>would</b> lose their sustenance by Easter 1630 (i.e. 31 MarchN.S.).|$|E

25|$|Virginia was {{substantially}} {{the largest}} of the thirteen states, with territory cutting west through to the Mississippi River. Without approval of Virginia and New York which likewise cut the other state territories in two, the agreement of <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>would</b> have had little effect. Virginia was home to leaders supporting the Constitution such as George Washington and James Madison, and those opposing such as Patrick Henry and George Mason. Only after a promise for a Bill of Rights did Virginia narrowly ratify. In the First Congress, James Madison introduced the first nine, and the tenth was introduced by another Virginian, Richard Henry Lee.|$|E
25|$|The Belgae {{attacked}} {{over the}} river, but were repulsed after a fierce battle. Realising {{they could not}} dislodge the Romans and aware of {{the approach of the}} Aedui into the lands of the Bellovaci, the Belgae decided to disband their combined force and return to their own lands. Caesar's informants advised him that whichever tribe Caesar attacked first, <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>would</b> come to their defence. They broke camp shortly before midnight. At daybreak, satisfied the retreat was not a trap, Caesar sent cavalry to harass the rear guard, followed by three legions. Many of the Belgae were killed in battle.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} re-organization of the Army after its {{transformation}} {{from the previous}} Liberator Army, occurred as soon as 1837. The cavalry started to be organized in eight regiments, of which four would be of lancers and the others of caçadores a cavalo (mounted rifles). The infantry ceased to have regiments and become organized in 30 independent battalions, of which 10 would be of caçadores (numbered 6 to 25) and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>would</b> be of line infantry (numbered 1 to 5 and 26 to 30). The artillery started to include four regiments, {{one of which was}} of horse and mounted artillery and the others were of garrison artillery.|$|E

50|$|The two {{locomotives}} were {{allocated to}} Norwich (Thorpe), {{but were not}} confined to the East Anglian service. Typically, one would work the East Anglian from Norwich to Liverpool Street, and return on less important services; <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>would</b> work lower-importance services from Norwich to London (such as the 15:17 Ipswich-Liverpool Street), and return with the East Anglian. When one locomotive was stopped for maintenance, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>would</b> work <b>the</b> East Anglian in both directions; and on the rare occasions that neither was available, another B17 would be used.|$|R
25|$|A {{collection}} {{of people can}} also exhibit swarm behaviour, such as pedestrians or soldiers swarming the parapets. In Cologne, Germany, two biologists from the University of Leeds demonstrated flock like behaviour in humans. The group of people exhibited similar behavioural pattern to a flock, where if {{five percent of the}} flock changed direction <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>would</b> follow. If one person was designated as a predator and everyone else was to avoid him, the flock behaved very much like a school of fish. Understanding how humans interact in crowds is important if crowd management is to effectively avoid casualties at football grounds, music concerts and subway stations.|$|E
25|$|In April 1943, the Armoured Car Regiment {{was removed}} from the {{division}} structure and replaced with an Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment. Additional troops were allocated to the infantry brigade. The artillery regiments were also reorganised, one would now be equipped with self-propelled guns while the other would keep towed guns. The tank establishment was increased to 278 tanks; 214 cruisers, 34 anti-aircraft tanks and 30 close support tanks. In the United Kingdom, the 7th Armoured Division was re-equipped with Cromwell tanks, the only division to use them as their main battle tank - <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>would</b> use M4 Sherman tanks. The Cromwell was used also by the armoured reconnaissance regiments of the 7th, 11th and Guards Armoured Divisions.|$|E
25|$|Sukarno {{planned to}} begin his 'Year of Dangerous Living' immediately, {{starting}} with an amphibious landing that very night (17 August) by Indonesian paratroops and Malaysian-Chinese exiles, who served as guides. Their mission was twofold: the Indonesians were to establish a guerrilla base and begin to recruit and train locals in that style of warfare, whilst <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>would</b> commit acts of sabotage and carry out assassinations. The former would establish a foothold for later raids into Malaysian territory as well as attempt to create unrest among the population against {{the government and the}} British, and the latter would increase the threat of that Indonesian presence so as to exacerbate internal stresses there. The Indonesians also hoped that the cover of the immense mangrove swamps would conceal the arrival of their intruders.|$|E

25|$|Sun He {{heard that}} Cai Ying (蔡穎), {{a member of}} his {{personal}} staff, enjoyed playing weiqi and that many of Cai Ying's subordinates also picked up the game and {{spent a lot of time}} playing. As he saw that weiqi was an unproductive activity meant to be a hobby or pastime, he became worried that Cai Ying and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>would</b> become complacent and neglect their duties from playing too much weiqi. He thus came up with an idea to subtly remind and motivate his subordinates. He called for a meeting and asked them to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of playing weiqi. One of them, Wei Yao (韋曜), went home, wrote an essay on this topic and presented it to Sun He, who had copies of it distributed among his personal staff.|$|E
25|$|Stalin {{suggested}} that a unified, but demilitarised, German state be established, hoping that it would either come under Soviet influence or remain neutral. When the US and UK remained opposed to this, Stalin sought to force their hand by blockading Berlin in June 1948. He gambled that <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>would</b> not risk war, but they airlifted supplies into West Berlin until May 1949, when Stalin relented and ended the blockade. In September 1949 the Western powers transformed Western Germany into an independent Federal Republic of Germany; in response the Soviets formed East Germany into the German Democratic Republic in October. In accordance with their earlier agreements, the Western powers expected Poland to become an independent state with free democratic elections. In Poland, the Soviets merged various socialist parties into the Polish United Workers' Party, and vote rigging was used {{to ensure that it}} secured office. The 1947 Hungarian elections were also rigged, with the Hungarian Working People's Party taking control. In Czechoslovakia, where the communists did have a level of popular support, they were elected the largest party in 1946.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{proposed}} theoretical views generally {{taken to}} approach bilingual aphasia. The more traditional Localizationist view, {{states that the}} loss of one language occurs because the patient's languages are represented in different brain areas or in different hemispheres. Thus, if one area is damaged, only the language represented there would suffer, and <b>the</b> <b>others</b> <b>would</b> not. The second view is the Dynamic view of selective language recovery, which proposes that the language system of representation and control is compromised as a result of damage. This theory is supported by the functional imaging data of normal bilinguals and holds that fluency in a language is lost because of an increase in the activation threshold. The Dynamic view offers an explanation for selective recovery of language and many reported recovery patterns in bilingual aphasia (See Recovery) There is much debate over which hemisphere supports the languages and which intrahemispheric neural regions represent each language within a bilingual individual. Most neuroimaging studies show no laterality differences between monolingual and bilingual speakers, supporting the hypothesis that languages share some areas of the brain, but also have some separate neural areas. Right hemisphere damage has been shown to result in the same patterns of cognitive-communication deficits in monolinguals and bilinguals; however, bilingual speakers who have left hemisphere damage are shown to be at risk for aphasia while monolingual individuals are not.|$|E
