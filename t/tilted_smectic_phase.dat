The dimers with a spacer consisting of a trisiloxane central group and relatively long alkylene groups show an intercalated tilted smectic structure. The layer spacings appear to be very weakly dependent on the terminal chain lengths. In these dimers the smectic phase is stabilized for the compounds with a short terminal chain. Dimers with an aliphatic alkylene spacer are liquid crystalline only when the spacer is relatively short and the terminal chains are long.

In the ferroelectric liquid crystal - Anopore composite only one relaxation process, assigned to rotation of the molecule around the molecular short axis, appears throughout all smectic phases. The temperature dependence of the relaxation frequency and of the dielectric strength of this process also shows no irregularity at the point of polarization sign reversal. The temperature dependence of the relaxation frequency follows the Arrhenius law with an activation energy slightly higher in the ferroelectric SmC* phase. Analysis of the non-linear changes of temperature dependence of the dielectric strength at the SmA-SmC* phase transition enables one to obtain the temperature dependence of the tilt angle of the molecules in the SmC* phase in the Anopore membrane.

40|$|We use the {{discrete}} phenomenological {{model to}} study theoretically the phase diagrams in antiferroelectric liquid crystals (AFLCs) {{as a function}} of optical purity and temperature. Recent experiments have shown that in some systems the number of phases is reduced if the optical purity is extremely high. In some materials the SmC ⋆ A phase is the only stable <b>tilted</b> <b>smectic</b> <b>phase</b> in the pure sample. In the scope of the presented model this high sensitivity of the phase sequence in the AFLCs to optical purity is attributed to the piezoelectric coupling which is reduced if optical purity is reduced. We limit our study to three topologically equal phases- SmC ∗, SmC ∗ α and SmC ∗ A and show that the reduction of optical purity forces the system from the antiferroelectric to the ferroelectric phase with a possible SmC ⋆ α between them. The effect of the flexoelectric and quadrupolar coupling is considered as well. If the phase diagram includes only two phases, SmC ⋆ and SmC ⋆ A, the flexoelectric coupling is very small. The materials which exhibit the SmC ⋆ α in a certain range of optical purity and temperature, can be expected to have a significant flexoelectric coupling that is comparable with the piezoelectric coupling. And finally, when temperature is lowered the phase sequence SmA → SmC ⋆ α → SmC⋆ → SmC ⋆ A is possible only in materials in which quadrupolar coupling is very strong. 1...|$|E

In addition, the region of smectic A stability is found to persist for moderate quadrupole moment values. For the largest quadrupole moment considered, domains comprising poorly defined, tilted layers are formed but fail to develop into coherent smectic structures.

In contrast, long range inter-layer correlations suppress the helicoidal structure in smectic X and it is bistable.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} from molecular dynamics simulations in the NPT ensemble of novel bent-core liquid crystal systems {{with the aim}} of determining the effect of both the bent-core shape and the addition of a transverse electric dipole upon the phase behaviour. The design of these molecules has been prompted by the realisation that ferroelectric phases need not consist of chiral molecules, since in the case of bent-core systems, selective steric shape packing results in a reduced system symmetry and ferroelectric properties without the need for chirality. A simple apolar model of the interaction employed a two-site Gay-Berne potential with the sites separated by #+-# 0. 5 reduced units for all models investigated. The angle between the sites, 180 deg - #gamma#, and thus the steric dipole was varied in a range #gamma# = 0 deg to #gamma# = 70 deg suggested by real molecules, and was seen to influence the phase behaviour markedly. The rod-like model formed isotropic, nematic, smectic A and <b>smectic</b> B <b>phases.</b> As the angle #gamma# increased the transition temperature to the ordered phase decreased; the nematic phase was first destabilised and then stabilised with respect to the <b>smectic</b> <b>phase.</b> Increasing #gamma# had subtle effects on layer packing in the #gamma# = 10 deg and #gamma# = 20 deg models. The #gamma# = 20 deg model was seen to undergo a transition from the <b>smectic</b> A <b>phase</b> to a <b>tilted</b> <b>smectic</b> B <b>phase.</b> For #gamma# = 40 deg a 'TGB-like' phase similar to the Blue phase seen in real materials was identified as the system cooled whereas for #gamma# = 70 deg no ordered phase formed.

As the angle #gamma# increased the transition temperature to the first ordered phase decreased more markedly than for the apolar models. <b>Smectic</b> A, <b>tilted</b> <b>smectic</b> B and a spontaneously polarised <b>smectic</b> B <b>phase</b> were observed in the #gamma# = 10 deg bent-core model.

40|$|A molecular-statistical {{theory for}} the entire {{sequence}} of the chiral <b>tilted</b> <b>smectic</b> <b>phases</b> is derived. Uniaxial and biaxial subphases {{were found to be}} stable in different temperature ranges depending on the molecular parameters. The model of a chiral molecule possessing a strong transverse terminal dipole moment and a quadrupole moment located in the molecular core was used. Direct dispersion and electrostatic interactions modulated by shape between molecules located in the same or in the neighboring smectic layers are taken into account. An effective long-range interaction arises after the minimization of the free energy with respect to polarization vectors. If the molecular quadrupole moment is small, only uniaxial phases with different periodicities arise. Their periodicity may be tens and hundreds of layers Sm-C*, or approximately two layers Sm-CA *, or several layers Sm-C *. In the presence of the nonpolar biaxial ordering in addition to polarization there is a cap-shaped border in the phase diagram that separates Sm-CA *, Sm-C*, and Sm-C *. If the molecules are nonchiral, Sm-CA, Sm-C, and the de Vries?s phases arise instead of the three phases mentioned above. If the molecular quadrupole moment is large, the left ?arm? of the border breaks into two lines, and a sequence of biaxial subphases arises in the area between these two lines. Among these biaxial subphases, the one with periodicity of three smectic layers appears to be the broadest in the temperature range. In addition, the subphases with different periodicities were found to be stable in narrow temperature ranges. The long helical rotation in every biaxial subphase is calculated.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{from a series}} of simulations undertaken to determine the effect of a novel form of molecular biaxiality upon the phase behaviour of the well established Gay-Berne (GB) liquid crystal model. Firstly, the simulation of a bulk system interacting via the Internally-Rotated Gay Berne (IRGB) potential, which offers a single-site representation of a molecule rigidly constrained into a zig-zag conformation, is presented. The results of simulations performed for systems of IRGB particles with an aspect ratio of 3 : 1 confirm that the introduction of biaxiality into the model results in the destabilisation of the orientationally ordered phases. For particles with a sufficiently pronounced zig-zag conformation, this results in the complete destabilisation of the <b>smectic</b> A <b>phase</b> and the <b>smectic</b> B <b>phase</b> being replaced by the <b>tilted</b> <b>smectic</b> J <b>phase.</b> Following these observations, the effect upon the phase behaviour of increasing molecular elongation is also considered, with an increase in the aspect ratio from 3 : 1 to 4 : 1 resulting in the nematic and <b>smectic</b> J <b>phases</b> being replaced by smectic A and <b>smectic</b> G <b>phases</b> respectively. Secondly, a version of the IRGB potential modified to include a degree of molecular flexibility is considered. Results obtained from bulk systems interacting via the flexible IRGB for 3 : 1 and 4 : 1 molecules show that the introduction of flexibility results in the destabilisation of the <b>smectic</b> A <b>phase</b> and the stabilisation of the nematic and tilted hexatic phases. Finally, the effect upon the phase behaviour of the rigid IRGB model of the inclusion of a longitudinal linear quadrupole is examined. These results show that increasing quadrupole moment results in the destabilisation of the tilted hexatic phase, although the biaxial order parameter is increased with increasing quadrupole moment. There is no clear correlation between quadrupole magnitude and the other observed phase transitions, with the nematic and <b>smectic</b> A <b>phases</b> being variously stabilised and destabilised with increasing quadrupole magnitude. For the 4 : 1 molecules with large quadrupole moments, buckled smectic layers are observed where some molecules are tilted with respect to a local layer normal.

40|$|Open AccessIn this Comment, I {{point out}} that the {{physical}} origin of molecular <b>tilt</b> in the <b>smectic</b> <b>phase,</b> found in the Monte Carlo simulations of systems of rodlike molecules with two terminal antiparallel transverse dipole moments by Bose and Saha [Phys. Rev. E 86, 050701 (R) (2012) ], is similar to the one proposed by McMillan. In particular, unlike in smectic-C liquid crystals, in which the molecules are known to have practically free rotations about their long axes, the molecular rotations are found to be partially frozen in the simulations. Further, I suggest that the attractive interaction between correlated splay fluctuations of the antiparallel polarized sublayers which lie close to each other in adjacent molecular layers give rise to the tilting, rather than a reduced attractive interaction between dipoles belonging to the two dipolar sublayers within one molecular layer, as proposed by the authors...|$|R
40|$|A flux liquid can {{condense}} into a smectic crystal in a pure layered superconductor {{with the}} magnetic field oriented nearly parallel to the layers. Similar order can arise in low temperature ^ 4 He films with a highly anisotropic periodic substrate potential. If the smectic order is commensurate with the layering, this periodic array is stable to quenched random point [...] like disorder. By tilting and adjusting {{the magnitude of the}} applied field, both incommensurate and <b>tilted</b> <b>smectic</b> and crystalline <b>phases</b> are found for vortex arrays. Related variations are possible by changing the chemical potential in the helium system. We discuss transport near the second order smectic freezing transition, and show that permeation modes in superconductors lead to a small non [...] zero resistivity and a large but finite tilt modulus in the smectic crystal. In helium films, the theory predicts a nonzero superfluid density and propagating third sound modes, showing that the quantum smectic is always simultaneously crystalline and superfluid.

40|$|A general phenomenological {{description}} {{and a simple}} molecular model is proposed for the 'discrete' flexoelectric effect in <b>tilted</b> <b>smectic</b> liquid crystal <b>phases.</b> This effect defines a polarization in a smectic layer induced by a difference of director orientations in the two smectic layers adjacent to it. It is shown that the 'discrete' flexoelectric effect is determined by electrostatic dipole-quadrupole interaction between positionally correlated molecules located in adjacent smectic layers, while the corresponding dipole-dipole interaction is responsible for a coupling between polarization vectors in neighboring layers. It is shown that a simple phenomenological model of a ferrielectric smectic liquid crystal, which has recently been proposed in the literature, {{can be used to}} describe the whole sequence of intermediate chiral <b>smectic</b> C* <b>phases</b> with increasing periods, and to determine the nonplanar structure of each phase without additional assumptions. In this sequence the phases with three- and four-layer periodicities have the same structure, as observed in the experiment. The theory predicts also the structure of intermediate phases with longer periods that have not been studied experimentally so far. The structures of intermediate phases with periodicities of up to nine layers are presented together with the phase diagrams, and a relationship between molecular chirality and the three-dimensional structure of intermediate phases is discussed. It is considered also how the coupling between the spontaneous polarization determined by molecular chirality and the induced polarization determined by the discrete flexoelectric effect stabilizes the nonplanar structure of intermediate phases...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} achiral hockey-stick-shaped mesogens forming <b>tilted</b> <b>smectic</b> liquid crystal <b>phases</b> of synclinic SmC- {{as well as}} anticlinic SmCa-type was {{prepared}} and characterized. While all homologues exhibit both phases, the balance shifts from anticlinic to synclinic order upon elongation of the terminal chain at the meta-position, defining the hockey-stick shape. The elongation also leads to an increased kinetic hindrance of the transition between syn- and anticlinic phases and a decreased transition enthalpy. These observations indicate that a well-defined kink (short meta-substituted chain) promotes the anticlinic structure while a higher flexibility between kinked and rod-shape (long meta-substituted chain) promotes synclinic order. An intermediate chain-length homologue was selected as host material for doping with syn- and anticlinic rod-shaped chiral dopants, respectively, at varying concentrations. Opposite {{of what might be}} expected the balance between syn- and anticlinic order was not simply dictated by the choice of dopant. Instead, both types of tilting order prevailed with roughly the same strength as in the achiral host regardless of which chiral material was added, up to concentrations well beyond normal doping conditions. Thus, at least with hockey-stick-shaped achiral hosts, syn- as well as anticlinic chiral compounds can be used effectively as chiral dopants without necessarily having an important impact on the clinicity of the resulting mixture. The hockey-stick design concept should be useful in producing achiral anticlinic-forming mesogens for low-polarization, long-pitch antiferroelectric liquid crystal mixtures. Finally, we point out that a mixture study like the one carried out here yields a conclusive means of establishing the clinicity of achiral <b>tilted</b> <b>smectics,</b> an endeavour that can sometimes be far from trivial...|$|R
