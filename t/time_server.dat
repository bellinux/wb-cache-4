As a workaround, a program running on the Pi can retrieve the time from a network <b>time</b> <b>server</b> or from user input at boot time, thus knowing the time while powered on. To provide consistency of time for the file system, the Pi does automatically save the time it has on shutdown, and re-installs that time at boot.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} an amplified DDoS attack through NTP is through a command called monlist, which sends {{the details of the}} last 600 people who have {{requested}} the time from that computer back to the requester. A small request to this <b>time</b> <b>server</b> can be sent using a spoofed source IP address of some victim, which results in 556.9 times the amount of data that was requested back to the victim. This becomes amplified when using botnets that all send requests with the same spoofed IP source, which will send a massive amount of data back to the victim.|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of how to {{integrate}} faulttolerant external and internal clock synchronization. In this paper we propose a new external/internal clock synchronization algorithm which provides both external and internal clock synchronization for as long as a majority of the reference <b>time</b> <b>servers</b> (servers with access to reference time) stay correct. When half or more of the reference <b>time</b> <b>servers</b> are faulty, the algorithm degrades to a fault-tolerant internal clock synchronization algorithm. We prove that at least 2 F+ 1 reference <b>time</b> <b>servers</b> are necessary for achieving external clock synchronization when up to F reference <b>time</b> <b>servers</b> can suffer arbitrary failures, thus the proposed algorithm provides maximum fault-tolerance. In this paper we also derive lower bounds for the best maximum external deviation achievable in standard mode and the best drift rate achievable in degraded mode. Our algorithm is optimal with respect to these two bounds: (1) the maximum external deviation is [...] ...|$|R

[...] Brownlee reiterated his policy to deal [...] "equally with Liberals and Conservatives in Ottawa", and declined King's overtures. [...] So too did Alberta Liberals, led by Howson and Charles Stewart, who sought to replace Brownlee rather than join with him. [...] In 1934, the Conservatives sent H. R. Milner to raise the possibility of the UFA and the Conservatives joining together against the Liberals and Co-operative Commonwealth Federation; Brownlee expressed interest, but made no move to enact such a coalition.

60|$|The twelfth of May, 1796, {{in north}} Italy, at Tavazzano, {{on the road}} from Lodi to Milan. The {{afternoon}} sun is blazing serenely over the plains of Lombardy, treating the Alps with respect and the anthills with indulgence, not incommoded by the basking of the swine and oxen in the villages nor hurt by its cool reception in the churches, but fiercely disdainful of two hordes of mischievous insects which are the French and Austrian armies. Two days before, at Lodi, the Austrians tried to prevent the French from crossing the river by the narrow bridge there; but the French, commanded by a general aged 27, Napoleon Bonaparte, who does not understand the art of war, rushed the fireswept bridge, supported by a tremendous cannonade in which the young general assisted with his own hands. Cannonading is his technical specialty; he has been trained in the artillery under the old regime, and made perfect in the military arts of shirking his duties, swindling the paymaster over travelling expenses, and dignifying war with the noise and smoke of cannon, as depicted in all military portraits. He is, however, an original observer, and has perceived, {{for the first time}} since the invention of gunpowder, that a cannon ball, if it strikes a man, will kill him. To a thorough grasp of this remarkable discovery, he adds a highly evolved faculty for physical geography and for the calculation of times and distances. He has prodigious powers of work, and a clear, realistic knowledge of human nature in public affairs, having seen it exhaustively tested in that department during the French Revolution. He is imaginative without illusions, and creative without religion, loyalty, patriotism or any of the common ideals. Not that he is incapable of these ideals: on the contrary, he has swallowed them all in his boyhood, and now, having a keen dramatic faculty, is extremely clever at playing upon them by the arts of the actor and stage manager. Withal, he is no spoiled child. Poverty, ill-luck, the shifts of impecunious shabby-gentility, repeated failure as a would-be author, humiliation as a rebuffed <b>time</b> <b>server,</b> reproof and punishment as an incompetent and dishonest officer, an escape from dismissal from the service so narrow that if the emigration of the nobles had not raised the value of even the most rascally lieutenant to the famine price of a general he would have been swept contemptuously from the army: these trials have ground the conceit out of him, and forced him to be self-sufficient and to understand that to such men as he is the world will give nothing that he cannot take from it by force. In this the world is not free from cowardice and folly; for Napoleon, as a merciless cannonader of political rubbish, is making himself useful. indeed, it is even now impossible to live in England without sometimes feeling how much that country lost in not being conquered by him as well as by Julius Caesar.|$|E
