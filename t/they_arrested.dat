5|$|His murder {{became a}} {{national}} cause célèbre. Several independent inquiries concluded that local government officials had been involved. However, the Bantul police early on discounted a political motive. Instead, <b>they</b> <b>arrested</b> a local driver named Dwi Sumaji for the murder, alleging a motive of jealousy. Sumaji was later acquitted after the prosecution withdrew its case owing {{to a lack of}} evidence. The police in turn were successfully sued for their mishandling of the case and deliberate destruction of evidence. The murder has never been solved, and is expected to be unprosecutable after 2014 due to Indonesia's 18-year statute of limitations on murder.|$|E
5|$|Nothing came of the proposal, which The Times of London {{called one}} of the most loathsome stories of the war. Historians believe that the SS, {{including}} its commander, Heinrich Himmler, intended the negotiations as cover for peace talks with the Western Allies that would exclude the Soviet Union and perhaps even Adolf Hitler. Whatever its purpose, the proposal was thwarted by the British government. <b>They</b> <b>arrested</b> Brand in Aleppo (then under British control), where he had gone to propose Eichmann's offer to the Jewish Agency, {{and put an end to}} it by leaking details to the media.|$|E
5|$|On August 21, 1864, the {{soldiers}} began traveling up Fishing Creek. For the next week, they searched the northern portion of Columbia County for deserters and draft evaders. They {{were unable to}} find any, but on August 28 <b>they</b> <b>arrested</b> 100 local citizens. Most were released, although some were taken to Fort Mifflin. The soldiers continued heading into the northernmost reaches of the Fishing Creek watershed. Unable to find any evidence of a conspiracy, they returned to Bloomsburg and remained in the county until December 1864. The last of the prisoners were released from Fort Mifflin several months after their arrest.|$|E

5|$|The deputies {{turned their}} {{attention}} to Cripple Creek itself. <b>They</b> <b>arrested</b> and imprisoned hundreds of citizens without cause. Many inhabitants of the town were seized on the street or pulled from their homes, then clubbed, kicked or beaten. The deputies formed a gauntlet and forced townspeople to pass through it, spitting, slapping and kicking them. With Bull Hill in his possession, Gen. Brooks began detaining the deputies. By nightfall, Brooks had seized the town and corralled all of Bowers' men.|$|E
5|$|After {{the victory}} over Mattau the {{governor}} {{decided to make}} use of the soldiers to cow other recalcitrant villages, starting with Taccariang, who had previously killed both VOC employees and Sinkan villagers. The villagers first fought with the Sinkanders who were acting as a vanguard, but on receiving a volley from the Dutch musketeers the Taccariang warriors turned and fled. The VOC forces entered the village unopposed, and burnt it to the ground. From Taccariang they moved on to Soulang, where <b>they</b> <b>arrested</b> warriors who had participated in the 1629 massacre of sixty Dutch soldiers and torched their houses. The last stop on the campaign trail was Tevorang, which had previously sheltered wanted men from other villages. This time the governor decided to use diplomacy, offering gifts and assurances of friendship, with the consequences of resistance left implicit. The Tevorangans took the hint, and offered no opposition to Dutch rule.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with those}} trivial messages, gandingans {{were also used}} in more seriously matters when {{signaling}} to others of imminent danger. During martial law, gandingans were used to warn villagers of incoming Marcos’ soldiers. Every time the villagers received the signal, they would disappear leaving the soldiers aloof until the soldiers themselves brought in a translator who told them, the gandingan {{was responsible for the}} scurry. So <b>they</b> <b>arrested</b> the gandingan player. A similar story talks about a brother of a man who stole someone’s carabao. In order to keep his brother from getting arrested, the brother set up a gandingan up in a tree and would clang it every time the police arrived to warn his brother to leave their house. But like Marcos’ soldiers, the police bought a translator and so they were finally able to arrest the theft for stealing and the brother on the gandingan for obstruction of justice.|$|E

5|$|Glik v. Cunniffe, 655 F.3d 78 (1st Cir. 2011) {{is a case}} {{in which}} the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that a private citizen has the right to record video and audio of public {{officials}} in a public place, and that the arrest of the citizen for a wiretapping violation violated his First and Fourth Amendment rights. The case arose when Simon Glik, a private citizen, filmed Boston, Massachusetts, police officers making an arrest in a public park. When the officers observed that Glik was recording the arrest, <b>they</b> <b>arrested</b> him and he was subsequently charged with wiretapping, disturbing the peace, and aiding in the escape of a prisoner. Glik then sued the City of Boston and the arresting officers, claiming that they violated his constitutional rights.|$|E
5|$|Lenin {{was back}} in Galicia when the First World War broke out, an {{international}} situation that he had paid little attention to. The war pitted the Russian Empire against the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and due to his Russian citizenship, Lenin was deemed a spy by the Austro-Hungarian authorities. In August, <b>they</b> <b>arrested</b> him and imprisoned him in Nowy Targ, although they released him once his anti-tsarist credentials were explained. To escape {{the violence of the}} eastern front, Lenin and his wife moved to neutral Switzerland, settling in Bern, although in February 1916 they moved to Zurich, which was cheaper. Lenin was angry that the German Social-Democratic Party had supported the German war effort, thereby contravening the Stuttgart resolution of the Second International that all socialist parties would oppose the international conflict. As a result, Lenin saw the Second International as defunct. In particular, he denounced German Marxist Karl Kautsky for supporting the German Social-Democratic Party.|$|E
5|$|Riker {{gets up to}} {{date with}} the situation, and decides that while Ramsey and his group are at large and refusing to leave the planet, there is little they can do. Before leaving they find that one of Beata's assistants, Ariel (Patricia McPherson), has married Ramsey, and was {{followed}} by Beata's guards to their camp, where <b>they</b> <b>arrested</b> the survivors and their families. The Away Team attempt to explain to Beata the reason for Ramsey's refusal to leave. Beata and her council reject his reasoning, and threatens to execute them the following day. After failing to convince Ramsey and his group to leave with them, Riker contacts the Enterprise, in hopes to transport Ramsey and his group without their consent (despite it being {{a violation of the}} Prime Directive, and almost certainly an end to his career), but Dr. Crusher (while treating an incapacitated Geordi in the Captain's chair) refuses to allow anyone to beam aboard for fear of being infected, but allows Data, as an android, to return. Riker orders Data to take command and get the Enterprise to the Neutral Zone before it's too late.|$|E
