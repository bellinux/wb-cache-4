5|$|After local {{businessman}} Paul Robinson {{is pushed}} from Lassiter's mezzanine, Mark {{is placed in}} charge of the investigation. He goes to the crime scene and then to the hospital to speak with Paul's wife, Rebecca. Mark learns Paul made several enemies before the attempt on his life and Diana Marshall becomes the prime suspect. Mark questions several Erinsborough residents, including Paul's son, Andrew, and Kate Ramsay, who gives Rebecca an alibi. When Andrew tries to help the investigation along, Mark warns him not <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> his job for him. Paul wakes up from his coma and implies that Diana pushed him. She flees the country. Weeks later, Mark asks Kate out to dinner and after initially turning him down, she agrees. Their date is interrupted by Declan and Kate leaves. Declan and Mark later fight over Kate, but she is only interested in Mark. After Kate confronts Mark about making threats towards Declan, they break up. Kate learns Declan was lying and she apologises to Mark. She kisses him in front of his colleagues, making him realise that she is worth the risk. Mark tells Kate that he needs to solve Paul's case to prove himself to his superiors, but he decides that {{he does not want to}} sacrifice their relationship and he gives up the case.|$|E

500|$|Lead singer Bono was {{influenced}} by the work of Delmore Schwartz when writing the lyrics of [...] "Acrobat", to whom the song is dedicated. The title of one of his short stories, In Dreams Begin Responsibilities, is quoted in the final verse. Bono noted the book [...] "was on my mind when I was writing the words... It's hard to wrap the book up in a few lines, but Delmore Schwartz is kind of a formalist... I'm the opposite. I'm in the mud as a writer, so I could do with a bit of , and that's why I enjoy him." [...] The song was developed from a riff guitarist The Edge developed during a soundcheck in Auckland, New Zealand, on the Lovetown Tour in 1989.

Stunt coordinator and second unit director Kevin Scott was tasked with depicting the four Navy SEALs tumbling down rugged terrain with sixty-degree inclines. Scott did not choreograph the stunt work, nor did he have the stunt performers use wires or dummies; he told them to fall [...] off cliffs and avoid looking at the ground until right before impact. [...] "We had to say, ‘Jump off the rock, land however you land, and go with it,’" [...] he said. [...] "When you’re doing that on a true hillside, you don’t have a choice. Gravity takes over. The only thing stopping the stunt people from dropping another thousand feet down the hillside was padding set up just outside of the shot." [...] Several stunt performers were injured after falling from the mountains, as the falls proved too difficult to control.

We have 60 episodes and that is probably as many as [...] really needs. It is a standard number for a show like this. I have done a little research and people say it is just crazy doing a series and movie at the same time. I would rather concentrate on doing a good job on the movie," [...] he noted. He directed the film from a story that he conceived with five other writer-animators from the series: Paul Tibbitt, Derek Drymon, Aaron Springer, Kent Osborne, and Tim Hill. The writers created a mythical hero's quest: the search for a stolen crown, which brings SpongeBob and his best friend Patrick to the surface. In 2003, during the {{production of}} The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, his mentor Jules Engel {{died at the age of}} 94. Hillenburg dedicated the film to his memory.

American pop rock singer Sally Maer also covered [...] "Everytime" [...] to release it on her studio album Bed of Roses (2008). [...] "Everytime" [...] was used during the 2009 Irish production of the 1896 play The Seagull. Jackie Evancho covered the song for her debut album Prelude to a Dream (2009). On August 19, 2010, her version debuted at number three on Billboards Classical Digital Songs chart. British singer Cher Lloyd covered the song live on The X Factor in the United Kingdom in 2010. This caused the song to re entry the top 50 singles chart in the UK.| On July 27, 2012, Kelly Clarkson covered the song during the Las Vegas stop of her summer tour, as an audience request. Clarkson had a harpist accompany her during the performance, and told the audience, [...] "This song {{is one of my}} favourite songs.

500|$|Susan and Karl were {{childhood}} sweethearts {{who married}} in 1978, before they both graduated from university. Karl has cheated on Susan twice with Sarah Beaumont (Nicola Charles) and Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) {{and the couple}} have broken up and divorced, but have later reunited and remarried. Woodburne has named the Karl, Susan and Izzy love triangle {{as one of her}} favourite storylines. Woodburne believes that Karl and Susan have a strong connection that is [...] "based upon such a good grounding". Karl and Susan are best friends who enjoy each other's company, share a deep connection and take joy in each other's quirks and ways. Woodburne described them as having a [...] "really solid foundation for a marriage" [...] and she has said that she does not want to see Susan and Karl's relationship break up again. Holy Soap have called Susan and Karl [...] "contenders for the friskiest couple on Ramsay Street". Following their [...] "passionate arguments", the couple enjoy making up together. They have a healthy attraction for each other. Fletcher says he and Woodburne find the scenes [...] "funny". Fletcher said [...] "Karl and Susan every now and again do go through a phase where they become slightly more amorous than in their tougher times and tougher storylines – suffice to say it's not bawdy, but I think the audience will enjoy the fun aspect". Karl and Susan have been caught in the nude together on three occasions; at the beach, in Lou Carpenter's (Tom Oliver) spa and when they went skinny-dipping in the bush. When asked what makes Karl and Susan popular with viewers, Woodburne said [...] "Because I think they're so flawed. There's two things: they make horrendous mistakes, both of them, but they both are coming from a place of well meaning. They're both wanting <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> the right thing and be helpful, but so often they get it so terribly wrong, and I think we can all relate to that." ...|$|E

It is not a subject at the moment which we can tackle easily because people have so many religious beliefs and until we have a more uniform view of ourselves I think it would be risky <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> anything in the way of eugenics...

2500|$|OB4CL popularized street-related, Mafioso rap on {{the east}} coast. While this style was {{originated}} by Kool G Rap in the late 1980s, it didn't completely permeate the hip hop world until the release of OB4CL in 1995. References to Cuban Linx could be heard heavily in following years with several notable changes in hip hop culture. For instance, the album refers to [...] "Wu-Gambinos" [...] in various occurrences; the term being {{a name for the}} 'alter-egos' of the rappers involved in Cuban Linx, and used on various later projects. These alter-egos inspired an already dissociative hip-hop world to adopt new names and personae, from Nas' Escobar moniker to Notorious B.I.G.'s Frank White counterpart, which he would go on to further utilize upon the release of OB4CL. A known fan of the Wu, Tupac Shakur began to refer to himself as Makaveli and gave his Outlawz crew new names, albeit with a militaristic, dictatorial theme. In regard to Raekwon's innovation of the gambinos, Method Man later affirmed [...] "Raekwon started that. Rae always had that mobster mentality, always liked to watch gangster movies and read mob books and stuff like that, you know? So he pretty much knew the names of the cats and what they was about. He polished his whole style like that." [...] Ghostface Killah also touched base on the gambino influence stating [...] "We done took that to the highest peak. We bonded as a tight family, so niggas is starting <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> that right now. Everybody thinking they have a strong family. We opened up the door for a lot of niggas.
