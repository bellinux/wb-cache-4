60|$|And, {{without further}} ado, the hapless youth was collared, and led down a vaulted passage into the guard-room, amid the jeers of the guard, who seemed only to owe him a grudge for his yesterday's prowess, and showed great alacrity in fitting {{him with a}} heavy set of irons; which done, he was <b>thrust</b> <b>head</b> {{foremost}} into a cell of the prison, locked in and left to his meditations.|$|E
60|$|They dragged {{a couple}} of stools to the door, and getting on to these, Casanova bade Balbi go first. The long, lean monk folded his arms, and <b>thrust</b> <b>head</b> and {{shoulders}} through the hole; then Casanova lifted him, first by the waist, then by the legs, and so helped him through into the room beyond. Casanova threw their bundles after him, and then placing a third stool {{on top of the}} other two, climbed on to it, and, being almost on a level with the opening, was able to get through as far as his waist, when Balbi took him in his arms and proceeded to drag him out. But it was done at the cost of torn breeches and lacerated legs, and when he stood up in the room beyond he was bleeding freely from the wounds which the jagged edges of the wood had dealt him.|$|E

60|$|The Ripton man {{was sitting}} with a hand on each knee, {{listening}} to {{the advice of his}} school instructor, who had <b>thrust</b> <b>head</b> and shoulders through the ropes, and was busy impressing some point upon him. Sheen found himself noticing the most trivial things with extraordinary clearness. In the front row of the spectators sat a man with a parti-coloured tie. He wondered idly what tie it was. It was rather like one worn by members of Templar's house at Wrykyn. Why were the ropes of the ring red? He rather liked the colour. There was a man lighting a pipe. Would he blow out the match or extinguish it with a wave of the hand? What a beast Peteiro looked. He really was a nigger. He must look out for that right of his. The straight left. Push it out. Straight left ruled the boxing world. Where was Joe? He must have missed the train. Or perhaps he hadn't been able to get away. Why did he want to yawn, he wondered.|$|E
6000|$|... "My chronometer!" [...] Captain Mitchell yelled violently at {{the very}} moment of being <b>thrust</b> <b>head</b> {{foremost}} through a small door into a sort of cell, perfectly black, and so narrow that he fetched up against the opposite wall. The door had been instantly slammed. He knew where they had put him. This was the strong room of the Custom House, whence the silver had been removed only a few hours earlier. It was almost as narrow as a corridor, with a small square aperture, barred by a heavy grating, at the distant end. Captain Mitchell staggered for a few steps, then sat down on the earthen floor {{with his back to the}} wall. Nothing, not even a gleam of light from anywhere, interfered with Captain Mitchell's meditation. He did some hard but not very extensive thinking. It was not of a gloomy cast. The old sailor, with all his small weaknesses and absurdities, was constitutionally incapable of entertaining for any length of time a fear of his personal safety. It was not so much firmness of soul as the lack of a certain kind of imagination--the kind whose undue development caused intense suffering to Senor Hirsch; that sort of imagination which adds the blind terror of bodily suffering and of death, envisaged as an accident to the body alone, strictly--to all the other apprehensions on which the sense of one's existence is based. Unfortunately, Captain Mitchell had not much penetration of any kind; characteristic, illuminating trifles of expression, action, or movement, escaped him completely. He was too pompously and innocently aware of his own existence to observe that of others. For instance, he could not believe that Sotillo had been really afraid of him, and this simply because it would never have entered into his head to shoot any one except in the most pressing case of self-defence. Anybody could see he was not a murdering kind of man, he reflected quite gravely. Then why this preposterous and insulting charge? he asked himself. But his thoughts mainly clung around the astounding and unanswerable question: How the devil the fellow got to know that the silver had gone off in the lighter? It was obvious that he had not captured it. And, obviously, he could not have captured it! In this last conclusion Captain Mitchell was misled by the assumption drawn from his observation of the weather during his long vigil on the wharf. He thought that there had been much more wind than usual that night in the gulf; whereas, as a matter of fact, the reverse was the case.|$|E
50|$|This {{was nothing}} more, however, than a calm {{before the storm}} because soon he was <b>thrust</b> <b>head</b> first into a life {{changing}} battle when the O*N*E Sentinel went rogue and attempted to not only destroy the Xavier Institute but to kill him and his fellow students. Springing into action Nezhno used his power like never before and increased his muscle mass, height, and weight to dangerous degrees. Despite the health risks and being told to stay put by headmaster Scott Summers, he jumped into the fray and may have saved many lives by his intervention. Despite knowing that his life may be forfeit {{he did his best}} to halt the Sentinels and was apparently neutralized by one and lay depowered and unconscious on the battlefield.|$|E

40|$|Vestibular {{neuritis}} (VN) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of peripheral vertigo. Caloric testing has been the traditional gold standard for detecting a peripheral vestibular deficit, but some recently developed bedside tests (head <b>thrust,</b> <b>head</b> heave, head shake and vibration test) were evaluated as a good alternative with similar sensitivity and specificity. These tests have shown both diagnostic value in the short term and prognostic value in the long term, and have availability and ease of use as an advantage. As an addition to clinical examination, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials can differentiate between involvement of superior and inferior branch of the vestibular nerve, but also between peripheral and central lesions. Although glucocorticoids are currently widely used in the treatment of VN, there is a lack of evidence for the validity of their administration. There are a number of high quality clinical trials that suggest vestibular rehabilitation exercises, which are based on the mechanisms of vestibular compensation, in the managment of VN.

40|$|Vestibularni {{neuritis}} (VN) jedan je od najčešćih perifernih uzroka vrtoglavice. Kalorimetrijsko ispitivanje vestibularnog organa zlatni je standard u dijagnostici VN-a. Ipak, novija istraživanja ističu praktičnost primjene kliničkih testova koji se izvode uz krevet bolesnika, a usporedivi su s osjetljivosti i specifičnosti u odnosu prema zlatnom standardu. Riječ je o »head thrust«, »head heave«, »head shake« i vibracijskom testu. Osim kalorimetrijskog testiranja kao zlatnog standarda u dijagnostici VN-a, vestibularni evocirani miogeni potencijali (VEMP) mogu razlikovati oštećenje gornje i donje grane vestibularnog živca, ali i periferno od centralnog oštećenja. Unatoč tomu što je u liječenju VN-a već dugo ustaljena primjena glukokortikoida, novija istraživanja opravdanost njihove upotrebe dovode u pitanje, a s druge se strane naglašava važnost fizikalne rehabilitacije. U ovome preglednom članku bit će iznesene najnovije spoznaje o patofiziologiji, dijagnostici i liječenju bolesnika s VN-om.

40|$|The {{underground}} construction operations {{require special}} attention to Occupational Safety and Health - OS&H aspects. In such situations, the presence of some ubiquitous pollutants (e. g. silica) further contributes to the already critical environment due to narrow operating spaces, high concentration of great power machinery, production of airborne particulates from excavation activities. Moreover, the geological variability of rock formations may challenge the design decisions, and affect the exposure of workers to noxious pollutants. In this context an ongoing and continuous monitoring of the workers' exposure conditions and of the working environment quality can provide useful information about the possible correlation between geo-mechanical parameters of the rock formations, erformance parameters of the used technologies and techniques, and production or release of pollutants. The paper summarizes {{the results of a}} study carried out at "La Maddalena" pilot tunnel of the Turin-Lyon railway line. The excavation by an open Tunnel Boring Machine -TBM- takes place in a geological environment of rocks with a content of crystalline silica (quartz) ranging from 30 to 80 %. Hence, ongoing and continuous measurements (personal and stationary) in compliance with the up to date reference standards were scheduled from the very early stages of the excavation, to monitor the content of airborne particulate (respirable fraction) and crystalline silica. The study discusses factors and parameters possibly affecting the content of airborne silica: • the geological aspects; • the state of fracturing of the rock (in terms of Rock Mass Rate - RMR); • the water seepage; • the TBM's Performance parameters (<b>thrust,</b> <b>head</b> rpm, and daily progress rate); • the micro-climatic conditions in the tunnel. Due to the great variability of activities involved by the tunnel driving macro-phases, the evaluations on workers were conducted by homogeneous groups, divided by work area and with specific indication of the different jobs. The results proved that for almost all the groups the crystalline silica levels exceeded 0, 025 mg·m- 3, Threshold Limit Value - Time- Weighted Average - TLV-TWA for the pulmonary fibrosis Risk suggested by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists - ACGIH (coherently with the ACGIH's approach to provide information on the risk involved by substances with reference only to health impairments other than cancer, and to include clear information on the possible carcinogenic class). The achieved results will be helpful to improve the Chemical Risk Management in the future Base Tunnel construction...|$|E

40|$|Colloid {{propulsion}} {{can provide}} flexible electric propulsion systems capable of delivering both high thrust density and {{high specific impulse}} at low power demand. It thus has wide applicability over a range of missions; from end of life de-orbit devices to sophisticated formation flying or disturbance compensation systems. Because of the low system demands colloid propulsion is particularly applicable to small satellites. Scalable micro-fabricated colloid thrusters allow many options: The total thrust available is simply {{a function of the}} number of nozzles and, for a given propellant the specific impulse {{is a function of the}} acceleration potential. We outline a nano-satellite micro propulsion system in support of a concept proposed by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL), and demonstrated with their SNAP- 1 nano-satellite mission. In the proposed target mission the nano-satellite co-flies with a micro satellite in low Earth orbit. The micro-fabricated propulsion system has multiple <b>thrust</b> <b>heads</b> which in the present concept gives full 6 degree of freedom control using appropriately positioned <b>thrust</b> <b>heads</b> each capable of delivering 100 micro Newton. The overall system mass is 524 g with an orbit average power demand of less than 0. 1 W...|$|R
