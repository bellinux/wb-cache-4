5000|$|The Harder <b>They</b> <b>Come,</b> {{directed}} by Perry Henzell {{is the most}} critically acclaimed piece of Jamaican cinema since its creation. Directors in Jamaica have since then emulated many of the aspects of The Harder <b>They</b> <b>Come.</b> The movies that succeeded The Harder <b>They</b> <b>Come</b> began a distinct culture in Jamaican Cinema based in realistic depictions of Jamaica as displayed by Perry Henzell. In The Harder <b>They</b> <b>Come,</b> [...] music was implicitly linked to the plot as a singer {{was used as the}} main character and the plot was in part tied to the music industry. The majority of films that followed The Harder <b>They</b> <b>Come</b> continued this theme by either having music intertwined with their plot or have a singer as the protagonist. Examples can be seen in works such as Third World Cop, Rockers, and Dancehall Queen. The Harder <b>They</b> <b>Come</b> also began a trend in regard to how Jamaican cinema approaches Christianity and Rastafarianism. Movies following The Harder <b>They</b> <b>Come</b> continued to treat Christianity as a negative force and exalt Rastafarianism. Movies which are prominent examples of this are One Love and Countryman. Both movies are laudatory and deferential to Rastafarianism while not presenting any counterargument or faults in the religion. In Cinema after The Harder <b>They</b> <b>Come,</b> which set its plot in Trench Town, there was a focus on creating movies in urban settings. However there are movies which break this trend as they are sometimes are set in the countryside.|$|R
