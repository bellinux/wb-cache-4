5|$|Yajnavalkya {{states that}} there are two paths to attain {{knowledge}}. One path is Pravritti-karma, wherein a person is driven by desire and a craving for rewards, forms his will, and then uses his knowledge to act out his free will.

5|$|I {{saw them}} as the {{ultimate}} all-American band. To me, they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression.... I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be perfect for the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression {{that would be used}} against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>want</b> to be friendly. But we decided to change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E
