5|$|Simović named Maček as Deputy Prime Minister {{once again}} in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>government,</b> but Maček was {{reluctant}} and remained in Zagreb while he decided what to do. While he considered the coup had been an entirely Serbian initiative aimed at both Prince Paul and the Cvetković–Maček Agreement, {{he decided that he}} needed to show HSS support for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>government</b> and that joining it was necessary. On 4 April he travelled to Belgrade and accepted the post, on several conditions; that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>government</b> respect the Cvetković–Maček Agreement and expand the autonomy of the Banovina Croatia in some respects, that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>government</b> respect the country's accession to the Tripartite Pact, and that one Serb and one Croat temporarily assume the role of regents. That same day exiled Croatian politician and Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić called for Croats to start an uprising against the government over his Radio Velebit program based in Italy.|$|E
5|$|At this point, several {{conflicts}} {{began to}} develop that threatened the future of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>government</b> at Athens. First, the planned coup at Samos was thwarted by the efforts of Samian democrats {{and a group of}} Athenians who they entrusted with helping them. When the army at Samos heard the news of the coup at Athens, which arrived along with exaggerated reports of outrages being perpetrated by <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>government,</b> they declared their loyalty to democracy and hostility to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>government.</b> At Athens, meanwhile, a split developed between the moderate and radical oligarchs, with Theramenes emerging alongside one Aristocrates son of Scelias {{as the leader of the}} moderate faction. The extremist faction, led by Phrynicus, containing such prominent leaders of the coup as Peisander and Antiphon, and dominant within the 400, opposed broadening the base of the oligarchy, and were willing to seek peace with Sparta on almost any terms. The moderates, on the other hand, although willing to seek peace with Sparta on terms that would preserve Athens' power, were not willing to sacrifice the empire and the fleet, and wanted to broaden the oligarchy to include the putative 5,000, presumably including all men of hoplite status or higher.|$|E
5|$|Banza was {{appointed}} {{minister of finance}} and minister of state in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>government.</b> The regime first secured diplomatic recognition from President François Tombalbaye of neighboring Chad, whom Bokassa met in Bouca, Ouham. After Bokassa reciprocated by meeting Tombalbaye on 2 April 1966 along the southern border of Chad at Fort Archambault, the two decided to help one another if either {{was in danger of}} losing power. Soon after, other African countries began to diplomatically recognize <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>government.</b> At first, the French government was reluctant to support the Bokassa regime, so Banza went to Paris to meet with French officials to convince them that the coup was necessary to save the country from turmoil. Bokassa met with Prime Minister Georges Pompidou on 7 July 1966, but the French remained noncommittal in offering their support. After Bokassa threatened to withdraw from the franc monetary zone, French President Charles de Gaulle decided to make an official visit to the Central African Republic on 17 November 1966. To <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>government,</b> this visit meant that the French had accepted the new changes in the country.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} days of his administration, Harrison dealt with the issue of Hawaiian {{annexation}}. Following a coup d'état against Queen Liliuokalani, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>government</b> of Hawaii led by Sanford Dole petitioned for annexation by the United States. Harrison was interested in expanding American influence in Hawaii and in establishing a naval base at Pearl Harbor but had not previously expressed an opinion on annexing the islands. The United States consul in Hawaii John L. Stevens recognized <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>government</b> on February 1, 1893 and forwarded their proposals to Washington. With just one month left before leaving office, the administration signed a treaty on February 14 and submitted it to the Senate the next day with Harrison's recommendation. The Senate failed to act, and President Cleveland withdrew the treaty shortly after taking office.|$|E

5|$|According to Guha, Nehru and his Congress colleagues {{called on}} Indians to honour Gandhi's memory {{and even more}} his ideals. Nehru used the {{assassination}} to consolidate {{the authority of the}} new Indian state. Gandhi's death helped marshal support for <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>government</b> and legitimise the Congress Party's control, leveraged by the massive outpouring of Hindu expressions of grief for a man who had inspired them for decades. The government suppressed the RSS, the Muslim National Guards, and the Khaksars, with some 200,000 arrests.|$|E
5|$|Around 120,000 {{men were}} mobilised during the conflict, and of these about 3,500 were killed. In the end, the victorious {{imperial}} faction abandoned its objective to expel foreigners from Japan and instead adopted {{a policy of}} continued modernization {{with an eye to}} eventual renegotiation of the Unequal Treaties with the Western powers. Due to the persistence of Saigō Takamori, a prominent leader of the imperial faction, the Tokugawa loyalists were shown clemency, and many former shogunate leaders and samurai were later given positions of responsibility under <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E

40|$|In the 1950 s and 1960 s, many Africans {{believed}} that independence would change prospects for {{rapid economic growth}} and development. First, independence implied the end of colonialism and its despotic, exploitative, and repressive institutions. Second, with the Europeans gone, Africans could now engage in democratic (people-driven, participatory, and inclusive) constitution-making to provide themselves with dispensations that reflected their customs, realities, beliefs, values, cultures, and aspirations. Third, public policy would be focused on maximizing {{the objectives of the}} indigenous peoples. Fourth, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>governments,</b> now controlled by Africans, would provide the enabling institutional environment for effectively managing ethnic diversity. Fifth, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> post-independence <b>governments</b> were expected to deal with historical injustices and provide all individuals, groups, and communities with the wherewithal to participate fully and effectively in economic growth and development. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>governments</b> were expected to restructure property rights, especially in environmental resources, and achieve equity in allocation and sustainability in exploitation. The general belief was that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> leaders would be able to restructure the critical domains, especially property rights, and produce new and more effective incentive structures. Given the extremely high levels of poverty in these countries, it was critical that <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>governments</b> provide incentive structures that encouraged indigenous entrepreneurship, as well as institutions that adequately constrained civil servants and politicians from engaging in inefficient redistributions of income and wealth...|$|R
