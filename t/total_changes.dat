Various substances, conventionally distinguished as simple, have several forms under which they present quite different properties. The semi-transparent, colourless, extremely active substance called phosphorus may be so changed as to become opaque, dark red, and inert. Like changes are known to occur in some gaseous, non-metallic elements, as oxygen; and also in metallic elements, as antimony. These <b>total</b> <b>changes</b> of properties, brought about without any changes to be called chemical, are interpretable only as due to molecular rearrangements; and, by showing that difference of property is producible by difference of arrangement, they support the inference otherwise to be drawn, that the properties of different elements result from differences of arrangement arising by the compounding and recompounding of ultimate homogeneous units.|$|E
60|$|The sudden {{changes of}} {{doctrine}} in the Times, which failed not to excite loud censure and indignant amazement in those days, were first intelligible {{to you when}} you came to interpret them as his changes. These sudden whirls from east to west on his part, and <b>total</b> <b>changes</b> of party and articulate opinion at a day's warning, lay {{in the nature of the}} man, and could not be helped; products of his fiery impatience, of the combined impetuosity and limitation of an intellect, which did nevertheless continually gravitate towards what was loyal, true and right on all manner of subjects. These, as I define them, were the mere scoriae and pumice wreck of a steady central lava-flood, which truly was volcanic and explosive to a strange degree, but did rest as few others on the grand fire-depths of the world. Thus, if he stormed along, ten thousand strong, in the time of the Reform Bill, indignantly denouncing Toryism and its obsolete insane pretensions; and then if, after some experience of Whig management, he discerned that Wellington and Peel, by whatever name entitled, were the men to be depended on by England,--there lay in all this, visible enough, a deeper consistency far more important than the superficial one, so much clamored after by the vulgar. Which is the lion's-skin; which is the real lion? Let a man, if he is prudent, ascertain that before speaking;--but above and beyond all things, let him ascertain it, and stand valiantly to it when ascertained! In the latter essential part of the operation Edward Sterling was honorably successful to a really marked degree; in the former, or prudential part, very much the reverse, as his history in the Journalistic department at least, was continually teaching him.|$|E
60|$|At {{one time}} Caesar was {{actually}} deposed {{from a high}} office which he held, by a decree of the Senate. He determined to disregard this decree, and {{go on in the}} discharge of his office as usual. But the Senate, whose ascendency was now, for some reason, once more established, prepared to prevent him by force of arms. Caesar, finding that he was not sustained, gave up the contest, put off his robes of office, and went home. Two days afterward a reaction occurred. A mass of the populace came together to his house, and offered their assistance to restore his rights and vindicate his honor. Caesar, however, contrary to what every one would have expected of him, exerted his influence to calm and quiet the mob, and then sent them away, remaining himself in private as before. The Senate had been alarmed at the first outbreak of the tumult, and a meeting had been suddenly convened to consider what measures to adopt in such a crisis. When, however, they found that Caesar had himself interposed, and by his own personal influence had saved the city from the danger which threatened it, they were so strongly impressed with a sense of his forbearance and generosity, that they sent for him to come to the senate house, and, after formally expressing their thanks, they canceled their former vote, and restored him to his office again. This change in the action of the Senate does not, however, necessarily indicate so great a change of individual sentiment as one might at first imagine. There was, undoubtedly, a large minority who were averse to his being deposed in the first instance but, being outvoted, the decree of deposition was passed. Others were, perhaps, more or less doubtful. Caesar's generous forbearance in refusing the offered aid of the populace carried over a number of these sufficient to shift the majority, and thus the action of the body was reversed. It is in this way that the sudden and apparently <b>total</b> <b>changes</b> in the action of deliberative assemblies which often take place, and which would otherwise, in some cases, be almost incredible, are to be explained.|$|E

They believe the new translations, the majority which use the Greek text of B. F. Westcott and F. J. A.

40|$|Purpose: Pulmonary {{ventilation}} {{and circulation}} dynamics are reflected on fluoroscopic images as changes in X-ray translucency. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the feasibility of non-contrast functional imaging using a dynamic flat-panel detector (FPD). Methods: Dynamic chest radiographs of 20 subjects (abnormal, n = 12; normal, n = 8) were obtained using the FPD system. Image analysis was performed to get qualitative perfusion mapping image; first, focal pixel value was defined. Second, lung area was determined and pulmonary hilar areas were eliminated. Third, one cardiac cycle was determined in each of the cases. Finally, <b>total</b> <b>changes</b> in pixel values during one cardiac cycle were calculated and their distributions were visualized with mapping on the original image. They were compared with the findings of lung perfusion scintigraphy. Results: In all normal controls, the <b>total</b> <b>changes</b> in pixel value in one cardiac cycle decreased from the hilar region to the peripheral region of the lung with left-right symmetric distribution. In contrast, in many abnormal cases, pulmonary blood flow disorder was indicated as a reduction of changes in pixel values on a mapping image. The findings of mapping image coincided with those of lung perfusion scintigraphy. Conclusions: Dynamic chest radiography using an FPD system with computer analysis is expected to be a new type of functional imaging, which provides pulmonary blood flow distribution additionally. © CARS 2009...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the {{long-term}} growth of the mandible in miniature pigs using 3 D Cone-Beam Computerized Tomography (CBCT). The mandibles of the pigs were scanned monthly over 12 months using CBCT and the 3 D mandibular models were reconstructed from the data. Seventeen anatomical landmarks were identified and classified into four groups of line segments, namely anteroposterior, superoinferior, mediolateral and anteroinferior. The inter-marker distances, inter-segmental angles, volume, monthly distance changes and percentage of changes were calculated to describe mandibular growth. The <b>total</b> <b>changes</b> of inter-marker distances were normalized to the initial values. All inter-marker distances increased over time, with the greatest mean normalized <b>total</b> <b>changes</b> in the superoinferior and anteroposterior groups (p< 0. 05). Monthly distance changes were greatest during the first four months and then reduced over time. Percentages of inter-marker distance changes were similar among the groups, reaching half of the overall growth around the 4 th month. The mandibular volume growth increased non-linearly with time, accelerating during the first five months and slowing during the remaining months. The growth of the mandible was found to be anisotropic and non-homogeneous within the bone and non-linear over time, with faster growth in the ramus than in the body. These growth patterns appeared to be related to the development of the dentition, providing necessary space for the teeth to grow upward for occlusion and for the posterior teeth to erupt...|$|E
40|$|Although we {{experience}} the visual {{world as a}} continuous, richly detailed space we often fail to notice large and significant changes. Such change blindness has been demonstrated for local object changes and changes to the visual form of whole images, however {{it is assumed that}} <b>total</b> <b>changes</b> from one image to another would be easily detected. Film editing presents such <b>total</b> <b>changes</b> several times a minute yet we rarely seem to be aware of them, a phenomenon we refer to here as edit blindness. This phenomenon has never been empirically demonstrated even though film editors believe they have at their disposal techniques that induce edit blindness, the Continuity Editing Rules. In the present study we tested the relationship between Continuity Editing Rules and edit blindness by instructing participants to detect edits while watching excerpts from feature films. Eye movements were recorded during the task. The results indicate that edits constructed according to the Continuity Editing Rules result in greater edit blindness than edits not adhering to the rules. A quarter of edits joining two viewpoints of the same scene were undetected and this increased to a third when the edit coincided with a sudden onset of motion. Some cuts may be missed due to suppression of the cut transients by coinciding with eyeblinks or saccadic eye movements but the majority seem to be due to inattentional blindness as viewers attend to the depicted narrative. In conclusion, this study presents the first empirical evidence of edit blindness and its relationship to natural attentional behaviour during dynamic scene viewing...|$|E
