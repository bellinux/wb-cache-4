5|$|The {{power of}} Tudor monarchs, {{including}} Henry, was 'whole' and 'entire', ruling, as they claimed, {{by the grace}} of God alone. The crown could also rely on the exclusive use of those functions that constituted the royal prerogative.

Nevertheless, as evident during Henry's break with Rome, the monarch worked within established limits, whether legal or financial, that forced him <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>closely</b> <b>with</b> both the nobility and parliament (representing the gentry).|$|E
