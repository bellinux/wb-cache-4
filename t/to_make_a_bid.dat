The club, {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy, courted newspaper owner Robert Maxwell, someone whom Murdoch regarded as a threat. Murdoch chose not <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bid</b> for Tottenham himself, for conflict of interest reasons, and used his newspapers to create momentum in favour of Sugar.|$|E

When Henry Tudor landed in Pembrokeshire, Wales in 1485 <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bid</b> for the throne, his descent from Rhys {{was one of the}} factors which enabled him to attract Welsh support (Henry flew a (Welsh) dragon banner at the battle of Bosworth Field).|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's health worsened in {{the winter}} of 1981–82. In the meantime, the country was governed by Andrei Gromyko, Dmitriy Ustinov, Mikhail Suslov and Yuri Andropov while crucial Politburo {{decisions}} were made in his absence. While the Politburo was pondering the question of who would succeed, all signs indicated that the ailing leader was dying. The choice of the successor would have been influenced by Suslov, but he {{died at the age of}} 79 in January 1982. Andropov took Suslov's seat in the Central Committee Secretariat; by May, it became obvious that Andropov would try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bid</b> for the office of the General Secretary. He, with the help of fellow KGB associates, started circulating rumours that political corruption had become worse during Brezhnev's tenure as leader, in an attempt to create an environment hostile to Brezhnev in the Politburo. Andropov's actions showed that he was not afraid of Brezhnev's wrath.|$|E

With some high-profile defections of star league players to cashed-up rugby union clubs from France, Hunt is expected to be the target of offers from overseas and within Australia. Australian rugby union club Queensland Reds stated their intentions to attempt to lure Hunt to the rugby union code, with the reasoning being his successful young career in rugby union. From within the NRL competition, Sydney based clubs Sydney Roosters and St. George Illawarra Dragons stated their intentions <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bid</b> for Hunt for his services in the 2010 season, claiming they could double Hunt's three-year deal from 2006, reported to be around $200,000.

25|$|From 1905 until 1908, Kaufmann {{worked on}} small {{projects}} in Sehring's office, {{such as a}} bed and breakfast in Berlin that would later be destroyed in World War II. He was also contacted to coordinate the décor for a bedroom used by the Wertheim company. This job put Kaufmann into contact with theater entrepreneur and director Eugen Robert. Robert commissioned Kaufmann to help him {{in the construction of}} a new theater he was planning, as Robert had been deeply impressed with the theater Kaufmann had built in Bielefeld. In connection with this and other works Kaufmann constructed while in Sehring's office, Kaufmann established his own architecture firm in 1908, on Luitpoldstraße in the Schöneberg section of Berlin. The firm later moved to Ansbacherstraße in Charlottenburg. The theater that Robert commissioned Kaufmann to build, the Hebbel Theater, gained Kaufmann his first widespread recognition. However, his perceived inexperience still counted against him, as he was not invited <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bid</b> on the renovation of the Stadttheater Bremerhaven. Only after one of the three architects invited <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bid,</b> Max Littmann, bowed out of the running, was Kaufmann invited to take his place.|$|E

25|$|The two {{airlines}} combined {{would have}} had 17% of Heathrow slots against British Airways' 43%. Worried about the increased competition it would face if such a merger went ahead, British Airways considered the takeover of either BMI or Virgin Atlantic to stop the merger. British Airways concluded {{it would be easier}} to take over the financially weaker and less high-profile BMI. However, in 2004 talks of any merger of the three airlines ended. In late 2006, the airline again dismissed renewed speculation that Virgin Atlantic was preparing <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bid</b> to acquire full control of BMI, despite Sir Richard Branson repeating in a radio interview that such a merger would be a logical business move.|$|E

25|$|Philadelphia Media Holdings LLC was an American {{holding company}} located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Founded by Brian Tierney in 2006, the company owned The Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News. After The McClatchy Company bought Knight Ridder in 2006, it {{announced}} it would sell, among other newspapers, The Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News. Interested in buying the papers, Brian Tierney assembled a group of Philadelphia businesspeople and investors <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bid.</b> In May 2006 Philadelphia Media Holdings bought the papers for US$515 million plus the assumption of the newspapers' liabilities. Declining circulation and ad revenue for The Inquirer and Daily News caused financial strain, {{which resulted in the}} filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company's creditors acquired the newspapers at auction and established a new holding company, Philadelphia Media Network, in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Edison's major {{innovation}} was {{the establishment}} of an industrial research lab. It was built in Menlo Park, a part of Raritan Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey (today named Edison in his honor), with the funds from the sale of Edison's quadruplex telegraph. After his demonstration of the telegraph, Edison was not sure that his original plan to sell it for $4,000 to $5,000 was right, so he asked Western Union <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bid.</b> He was surprised to hear them offer $10,000 ($ in today's dollars.), which he gratefully accepted. The quadruplex telegraph was Edison's first big financial success, and Menlo Park became the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement. Edison was legally attributed with most of the inventions produced there, though many employees carried out research and development under his direction. His staff was generally told to carry out his directions in conducting research, and he drove them hard to produce results.|$|E
25|$|Gene Autry, former movie cowboy, singer, {{actor and}} owner of Golden West Broadcasters (including Los Angeles' KMPC radio and KTLA television), {{attended}} the Major League Owners' meeting in St. Louis in 1960 in hopes of winning broadcasting rights for the new team's games. Hall of Famer Hank Greenberg was initially {{on the fast track}} to be the team's first owner, with Bill Veeck as a partner. However, when O'Malley got word of Veeck's involvement, he invoked his exclusive right to operate a major league team in Southern California. In truth, O'Malley wasn't about to compete with Veeck, who was known as a master promoter. After it became obvious that O'Malley would never sign off on the deal as long as Veeck was a part-owner, Greenberg was forced to bow out. After another bid by Chicago insurance executive and future A's owner Charlie Finley failed, Autry was persuaded <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bid</b> himself. Autry (who had been a minority stockholder in the Angels' PCL rival, the Hollywood Stars) agreed, and purchased the franchise.|$|E

25|$|The {{treasure}} of the Empire being allegedly penniless {{on the death}} of Iyasu, it suffered further from ethnic conflict between nationalities that {{had been part of the}} Empire for hundreds of years—the Agaw, Amharans, Showans, and Tigreans—and the Oromo newcomers. Mentewab's attempt to strengthen ties between the monarchy and the Oromo by arranging the marriage of her son to the daughter of an Oromo chieftain backfired in the long run. Iyasu II gave precedence to his mother and allowed her every prerogative as a crowned co-ruler, while his wife Wubit suffered in obscurity. Wubit waited for the accession of her own son <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bid</b> for the power wielded for so long by Mentewab and her relatives from Qwara. When Iyoas assumed the throne upon his father's sudden death, the aristocrats of Gondar were stunned to find that he more readily spoke in the Oromo language rather than in Amharic, and tended to favor his mother's Yejju relatives over the Qwarans of his grandmothers family. Iyoas further increased the favor given to the Oromo when adult. On the death of the Ras of Amhara, he attempted to promote his uncle Lubo governor of that province, but the outcry led his advisor Wolde Leul to convince him to change his mind.|$|E

However, Montreal's mayor, Sarto Fournier, backed the proposal, allowing Canada <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>bid</b> to the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE). [...] At the BIE's May 5, 1960 meeting in Paris, [...] Moscow was awarded the fair after five rounds of voting that eliminated Austria's and then Canada's bids.

Montreal's new mayor, Jean Drapeau, lobbied the Canadian government to try again for the fair, which they did.

The Highlanders immediately ran into stiff opposition from {{elements of the}} 12th SS Panzer Division and despite heavy artillery support were unable to advance all day.

At 0730 the 2nd Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, also of the 227th Highland Brigade, launched an attack aimed at capturing the Odon crossing at Tourmauville, north-west of the village of Baron-sur-Odon. [...] With the German forces engaged by the Highland Light Infantry, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders supported by the 23rd Hussars, were able to advance to Colleville with relative ease. There the small German garrison supported by 88mm guns, inflicted heavy casualties upon the British and denied them the village until the afternoon. The battalion seized the bridge at Tourmauville at around 1700 and a bridgehead was established.
