2500|$|Richards has {{frequently}} {{stated that he}} feels less like a creator than a conduit when writing songs: [...] "I don't have that god aspect about it. I prefer <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as an antenna. There's only one song, and Adam and Eve wrote it; the rest is a variation on a theme." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{his return}} to Lancashire from Leicestershire, manager Mike Watkinson was {{impressed}} by Smith's performances with the bat and ball. Smith's contract with the club was renewed, along with nine other young players who were expected to {{form the basis of}} Lancashire's squad in the future. Smith stated his intent to cement his place in the Lancashire side as an all-rounder, saying that [...] "My batting has come on in leaps and I would like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as more of an allrounder. I batted in the top six at Leicestershire in the limited-over games and at seven in the four-dayers, and I got 50-plus {{a couple of times and}} had a run average of about 40. After the responsibility there I know I can do it." ...|$|E
60|$|This was charming. She {{was such}} an {{extremely}} agreeable young person that it was delightful for me <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> in any way as her husband's successor.|$|E
60|$|I {{was nearly}} {{nineteen}} years old before I had sufficiently rallied my courage {{to be able}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> seriously <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> and my prospects.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh no. My sister {{tells me}} I am always angry {{with people who}} do not say just what I like. But I hope I am not given <b>to</b> <b>think</b> ill <b>of</b> them. In the end I am usually obliged <b>to</b> <b>think</b> ill <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> for being so impatient." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{may happen}} then I cannot tell, for I want three months also <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it <b>myself.</b> Till then, good-bye." [...] She gave him {{her hand and}} left it in his for a few seconds. He tried to draw her to him; but she {{resisted}} him, still smiling. Then she left him.|$|R
6000|$|Helen grew grave also. [...] "I don't like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> {{as an old}} actress. I {{want to have a}} fixed abiding-place when I am forty-five. Gray hairs should {{shine in}} the light of a fireside." ...|$|E
60|$|Had I {{had less}} to do I would have been lonely {{in a city where}} I hardly knew a soul. But my work kept me so busy I had no time <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> and perhaps this is one reason why I did not rebel before I did.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, sir!" [...] Jack said eagerly, [...] "and {{please do}} not think that I am not glad to hear that you have got a place more worthy of you. It was a blow to me just at first, and I was selfish <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> even for a moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sybil's a dear girl," [...] she said, [...] "although she's {{a terrible}} {{nuisance}} to me. I shouldn't {{be at all}} surprised either if she developed views. I wish you were a marrying man, Arranmore. I used <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> you <b>myself</b> once, but you would be too old for me now. You're exactly the right age for Sybil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't {{get them}} to look at {{plantations}} down there. They've been taken in too often. But I do hate to give the place up--more for Hughie's sake, I swear, than my own. He was bound up in it. You see, he was a persistent chap, and hated to acknowledge defeat. It--it makes me uncomfortable <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it <b>myself.</b> We were running slowly behind, but with the Jessie we hoped to muddle through in some fashion." ...|$|R
60|$|At last I seriously began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Tartarus <b>myself,</b> and <b>of</b> a calm repose flat on my back, such as H. told of in his memorable passage. But just then, dim and faint on the horizon, I thought I discerned {{the long}} line of a bank of land. It was. This was a channel; that was the shore. England had not sunk. I stood my ground; and in an hour we came running, bounding, and rolling towards the narrow mouth of the Folkstone pier heads.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{very nice}} {{to hear you say}} so," [...] the girl answered, taking the chair which, at Lady St. Maurice's motion, a servant had wheeled up to the fire. [...] "I like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> as {{belonging}} altogether to my mother and her people. I have been very unhappy with my father's relations." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was very}} honest indeed, and I really believe he spoke as he intended, {{and that he}} was a man that was as well {{qualified}} to make me happy, as to his temper and behaviour, as any man ever was; but his having no estate, and being run into debt on this ridiculous account in the country, made all the prospect dismal and dreadful, and I knew not what to say, or what <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will not}} be sad for him, I hope," [...] said Mrs. Peacocke. [...] "In all this, I {{endeavour}} {{to think of him}} rather than of myself. When I am forced <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> {{it seems to me that}} my life has been so blighted and destroyed that it must be indifferent what happens to me now. What has happened to me has been so bad that I can hardly be injured further. But if there can be a good time coming for him,--something at least of relief, something perhaps of comfort,--then I shall be satisfied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have made}} an {{excellent}} debut as aide-de-camp,' said he; 'Savary has told me all that has occurred, and nothing could have been better arranged. I have not time <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> such things <b>myself,</b> but my wife will sleep more soundly now that she knows that this Toussac {{is out of the}} way.' ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. JUNO. I don't want {{to break}} your heart. I can't bear <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> your sitting here alone. I can't bear <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> sitting alone <b>myself</b> somewhere else. It's so senseless--so ridiculous--when we might be so happy. I don't want to be wicked, or coarse. But I like you very much; and I do want to be affectionate and human.|$|R
60|$|It is {{sometimes}} the case, that an old mariner like him will conceive {{a very strong}} attachment for some young sailor, his shipmate; an attachment so devoted, as to be wholly inexplicable, unless originating in that heart-loneliness which overtakes most seamen as they grow aged; impelling them to fasten upon some chance object of regard. But however it was, my Viking, thy unbidden affection was the noblest homage ever paid me. And frankly, I am more inclined <b>to</b> <b>think</b> well <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> as in some way deserving thy devotion, than from the rounded compliments of more cultivated minds.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would be}} very good if you would let me. I have every {{disposition}} to be good. It is my misfortune and habit, I know, <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> paramount to anybody else; but who is not like me in that respect? However, when Captain Keeldar is made comfortable, accommodated with all he wants, including a sensible, genial comrade, it gives him a thorough pleasure to devote his spare efforts to making that comrade happy. And should we not be happy, Caroline, in the Highlands? We {{will go to the}} Highlands. We will, if you can bear a sea-voyage, go to the Isles--the Hebrides, the Shetland, the Orkney Islands. Would you not like that? I see you would.--Mrs. Pryor, I call you to witness. Her face is all sunshine at the bare mention of it." ...|$|E
60|$|But now I had <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> If I were {{overtaken}} the Prussians {{would certainly}} make short work {{of me in}} their disappointment. If it were so--if I lost my life--I should still have sold it at a glorious price. But I had hopes that I might shake them off. With ordinary horsemen upon ordinary horses I should have had no difficulty in doing so, but here both steeds and riders were of the best. It was a grand creature that I rode, but it was weary with its long night's work, and the Emperor {{was one of those}} riders who {{do not know how to}} manage a horse. He had little thought far them and a heavy hand upon their mouths. On the other hand, Stein and his men had come both far and fast. The race was a fair one.|$|E
6000|$|... '"I know {{he liked}} me. That's {{what made it}} so hard. Such a splendid man! [...] . That morning he slipped his hand under my arm. [...] . He, too, was {{familiar}} with me." [...] He burst into a short laugh, and dropped his chin on his breast. [...] "Pah! When I remembered how that mean little beast {{had been talking to}} me," [...] he began suddenly in a vibrating voice, [...] "I couldn't bear <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> [...] . I suppose you know [...] ." [...] I nodded. [...] "More like a father," [...] he cried; his voice sank. [...] "I would have had to tell him. I couldn't let it go on--could I?" [...] "Well?" [...] I murmured, after waiting a while. [...] "I preferred to go," [...] he said slowly; [...] "this thing must be buried." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I can't say I {{have been}} bored to extinction. I am still alive, as you see; but I {{have done with}} that and I feel {{extremely}} idle. There is only one thing I would like to do. I {{want to find a}} few words that could convey to you my gratitude for all your friendliness in the past, at the time when you let me see so much of you in London. I felt always that you took me on my own terms and that so kindly that often I felt inclined <b>to</b> <b>think</b> better <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> But I am afraid I am wearying you, Mrs. Travers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you'll {{say about the}} rest of my story," [...] I went on. [...] "I {{scarcely}} know what <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it <b>myself.</b> But here it is. There is an inn in Little Drayton kept by a man named Hart, and Cecil and de Cartienne go there--sometimes. About a month before I went to Borden Tower the man Hart disappeared. He left home on a journey, the nature of which he kept secret even from his daughter, and has never returned or been heard of. All the information which his daughter can give is that he has left home before on a similar errand and invariably returned with money after three or four days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It wasn't so dark as {{you might}} think," [...] said he. [...] "After my eyes {{got used to the}} place I could see very well. But there was nothing to see--just walls on each side. There was more of the {{passageway}} ahead of me, but I began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> snakes <b>myself,</b> and as I did not have a club or anything to kill them with, I concluded I wouldn't go any farther. It isn't so very dirty in there. Most of this I got on myself scraping down the burnt vines. Here comes the captain. He doesn't generally oversleep himself like this. If he will go with me, we will explore that crack." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have already}} told my own friends that I have asked you [...] {{to be my}} wife. I tell you this, in order that you may [...] know how little effect your answer to me has had towards [...] {{inducing}} me to give you up. What you said about your [...] father and your family has no weight with me, and ought [...] ultimately to have none with you. This business of your [...] father's is a great misfortune,--so great that, probably, [...] had we not known each other before it happened, it might [...] have prevented our becoming intimate when we chanced to [...] meet. But we had met before it happened, and before it [...] happened I had determined {{to ask you to}} be my wife. What [...] should I have <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> if I allowed my heart to [...] be altered by such a cause as that? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} what you will think of me. I {{do not know}}, to-night, [...] what <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> I have left Howard. It is not because he [...] was cruel to me, or untrue. He does not love me, nor I him. I [...] cannot expect you, who have known the {{happiness}} of marriage, to [...] realize the tortures of it without love. My pain in telling you [...] this now is all the greater because I realize your belief as to the [...] sacredness of the tie--and it is not your fault that you did not [...] instil that belief into me. I have had to live and to think and to [...] suffer for myself. I do not attempt to account for my action, and I [...] hesitate to lay the blame upon the modern conditions and atmosphere [...] in which I lived; for I feel that, above all things, I must be [...] honest with myself.|$|E
6000|$|I {{walked through}} the grey streets of Forli, {{wondering}} at my happiness; it was too great to realise. It seemed absurd that I, a poor, commonplace man, should be chosen out for this ecstasy of bliss. I had been buffeted about the world, an exile, wandering {{here and there in}} search of a captain under whom to serve. I had had loves before, but common, grotesque things--not like this, pure and heavenly. With my other loves I had often felt a certain ugliness about them; they had seemed sordid and vulgar; but this was so pure, so clean! She was so saintly and innocent. Oh, it was good! And I laughed at myself for thinking I was not in love with her. I had loved her always; when it began I did not know ... and I did not care; all that interested me now was <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> loving and beloved. I was not worthy of her; she was so good, so kind, and I a poor, mean wretch. I felt her a goddess, and I could have knelt down and worshipped her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Although in my last, which, as I before observed, was hastily written, I express'd my {{wish to be}} allow'd, in some {{capacity}} or other, {{to serve}} your Lordship, yet I am not so foolish as <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> fastening <b>myself</b> on you, my Lord, bon gré ou malgré. One reason for my expressing that wish, was an idea that your Lordship might go abroad before long; and, added to my own wish to see something {{of the world on}} which fate has thrown me, it occurred to me at the moment, that on such an occasion the services of one who is warmly attach'd to you, perhaps romantically, for I know nothing of your Lordship but by your writings, might be acceptable.|$|R
60|$|I am free {{to confess}} {{that when he}} thus left me at liberty there was but one thought in my mind, and that to seek my own safety in flight, {{regardless}} of my comrades, or of the old negro whose life might be in danger if I thus deserted him. I was cowardly enough for an instant <b>to</b> <b>think</b> only <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> <b>to</b> look forward only {{to the possibility of}} saving my own skin; but, fortunately, even before I could have turned to flee like a poltroon, I realized that it was my duty as a lad of Virginia, even though I had seemingly thrown aside the name of Minute Boy, to remain with my comrades whom I had thus counselled into peril.|$|R
6000|$|... "My present {{business}} is to enjoy youth, and not <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> fettering <b>myself,</b> by promise or vow, to this man or that. When first I saw Isidore, I believed he would help me to enjoy it I believed he would be content with my being a pretty girl; {{and that we should}} meet and part and flutter about like two butterflies, and be happy. Lo, and behold! I find him at times as grave as a judge, and deep-feeling and thoughtful. Bah! Les penseurs, les hommes profonds et passionnés ne sont pas à mon goût. Le Colonel Alfred de Hamal suits me far better. Va pour les beaux fats et les jolis fripons! Vive les joies et les plaisirs! A bas les grandes passions et les sévères vertus!" ...|$|R
60|$|As I looked I {{shouted in}} surprise. It {{seemed that the}} whole of Penetier was under my feet. The green slope {{disappeared}} in murky clouds of smoke. There were great pillars and huge banks of yellow and long streaks of black, and here and there, underneath, moving splashes of red. The thing did not stay still one instant. It changed so that I could not tell what it did look like. Them were life and movement in it, and something terribly sinister. I tried to calculate how far distant the fire was and how fast it was coming, but that, in my state of mind, I could not do. The whole sweep of forest below me was burning. I felt the strong breeze and smelled the burnt wood. Puffs of white smoke ran out ahead of the main clouds, and I saw three of them widely separated. What they meant puzzled me. But {{all of a sudden}} I saw in front of the nearest a flickering gleam of red. Then I knew those white streams of smoke rose where the fire was being sucked up the canyons. They leaped along with amazing speed. It was then that I realized that Dick and Hiram had been caught by one of these offshoots of the fire, and had been compelled to turn away to save their lives. Perhaps they would both be lost. For a moment I felt faint, but I fought it off. I had <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> It was every one for himself, and perhaps there was many a man caught on Penetier with only a slender chance for life.|$|E
60|$|That winter passed {{very quickly}} and happily for me, {{and at the end}} of the {{legislative}} session I had acquitted myself so much to the satisfaction of one of the newspapers which I wrote for that I was offered a place on it. I was asked to be city editor, as it was called in that day, and I was to have charge of the local reporting. It was a great temptation, and for a while I thought it the greatest piece of good fortune. I went down to Cincinnati to acquaint myself with the details of the work, and to fit myself for it by beginning as reporter myself. One night's round of the police stations with the other reporters satisfied me that I was not meant for that work, and I attempted it no farther. I have often been sorry since, for it would have made known to me many phases of life that I have always remained ignorant of, but I did not know then that life was supremely interesting and important. I fancied that literature, that poetry was so; and it was humiliation and anguish indescribable <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> torn from my high ideals by labors like those of the reporter. I would not consent even to do the office work of the department, and the proprietor and editor who was more especially my friend tried to make some other place for me. All the departments were full but the one I would have nothing to do with, and after a few weeks of sufferance and suffering I turned my back on a thousand dollars a year, and for the second time returned to the printing-office.|$|E

60|$|What could I do but bow acceptance? It was Mr. Hawkins' interest, not mine, and I had <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> him, not <b>myself,</b> and besides, while Count Dracula was speaking, {{there was}} that {{in his eyes and}} in his bearing which made me {{remember}} that I was a prisoner, and that if I wished it I could have no choice. The Count saw his victory in my bow, and his mastery in the trouble of my face, for he began at once to use them, but in his own smooth, resistless way.|$|R
