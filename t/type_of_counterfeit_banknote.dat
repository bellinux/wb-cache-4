40|$|With the {{advancement}} in imaging technologies for scanning and printing, production <b>of</b> <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknotes</b> has become cheaper, easier, and more common. The proliferation <b>of</b> <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknotes</b> causes loss to banks, traders, and individuals involved in financial transactions. Hence, it is inevitably needed that efficient and reliable techniques for detection <b>of</b> <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknotes</b> should be developed. With {{the availability of}} powerful smartphones, it has become possible to perform complex computations and image processing related tasks on these phones. In addition to this, smartphone users have increased greatly and numbers continue to increase. This is a great motivating factor for researchers and developers to propose innovative mobile-based solutions. In this study, a novel technique for verification of Pakistani banknotes is developed, targeting smartphones with android platform. The proposed technique is based on statistical features, and surface roughness of a banknote, representing different properties of the banknote, such as paper material, printing ink, paper quality, and surface roughness. The selection of these features is motivated by the X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis <b>of</b> genuine and <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknotes.</b> In this regard, two important areas of the banknote, i. e., serial number and flag portions were considered since these portions showed the maximum difference between genuine and <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknote.</b> The analysis confirmed that genuine and <b>counterfeit</b> <b>banknotes</b> are very different {{in terms of the}} printing process, the ingredients used in preparation of banknotes, {{and the quality of the}} paper. After extracting the discriminative set of features, support vector machine is used for classification. The experimental results confirm the high accuracy of the proposed technique...|$|R

2500|$|Counterfeit {{money is}} {{imitation}} currency produced without the legal sanction {{of the state}} or government. Producing or using counterfeit money {{is a form of}} fraud or forgery.

[...] Before the introduction of paper money, the most prevalent method <b>of</b> <b>counterfeiting</b> involved mixing base metals with pure gold or silver.
