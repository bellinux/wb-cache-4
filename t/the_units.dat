5|$|Art {{director}} Jeremy Cook {{stated that}} maintaining readability and clarity of <b>the</b> <b>units</b> and combat space was highest {{priority of the}} game's art direction. He also {{wanted to make sure}} that the visual style remained consistent with the Halo universe, by ensuring that the recognisable traits of <b>the</b> <b>units</b> and structures were preserved. The Banished's art style was designed to contrast visually with the UNSC. Cook wanted the Banished to be reminiscent of the Covenant, but with a greater emphasis on the aesthetic of the Brute species. Brute vehicles and weapons featured in past Halo games helped influence the design changes and creation of new technology in the Banished's arsenal.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} this period, the {{constant}} attempts at reorganisation had proved a mixed bag, particularly for the auxiliary forces. The Militia was heavily understrength and disorganised, whilst the number of recruits for the Volunteers was falling off and the financial situation of <b>the</b> <b>units</b> was becoming worrying. The system of central per-capita grants helped support <b>the</b> <b>units,</b> despite the worrying side-effect of causing an incentive to keep as many men on the books as possible regardless of fitness, but even so it was becoming apparent that many Volunteer Corps were headed towards financial collapse unless some action were taken.|$|E

5|$|Adding to the {{confusion}} is the tendency of units (again for historical reasons) to misuse titles for larger administrative structures.
