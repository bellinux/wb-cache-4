25|$|The lower Himalayan foothills and Inner Terai or Doon Valleys of Nepal and India {{are highly}} malarial {{due to a}} warm climate and marshes {{sustained}} {{during the dry season}} by groundwater percolating down from the higher hills. Malarial forests were intentionally maintained by the rulers of Nepal as a defensive measure. Humans attempting to live in this zone suffered much higher mortality than at higher elevations or below on the drier Gangetic Plain. However, the Tharu people had lived in this zone long enough to evolve resistance via multiple genes. Medical studies among the Tharu and non-Tharu population of the Terai yielded <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> prevalence of cases of residual malaria is nearly seven times lower among Tharus. The basis for resistance has been established to be homozygosity of α-Thalassemia gene within the local population. Endogamy along caste and ethnic lines appear to have prevented these genes from being more widespread in neighboring populations.|$|E
25|$|No {{applications}} for dissolution {{may be made}} within one year {{of the formation of}} the civil partnership, except in Scotland. Like marriage, irretrievable breakdown is the only ground on which the court may make a dissolution order. Also, Section 44 provides that the Court may not make such an order unless the applicant satisfies as to certain facts which are the same as those for divorce under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 (MCA), except that adultery cannot be relied on for a civil partnership dissolution: the respondent's behaviour, 2 years' separation and consent, 2 years' desertion or 5 years' separation. If the applicant satisfies the court in this respect, the court must make a dissolution order unless it is not convinced by <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> partnership has indeed broken down irretrievably. The MCA section 5 defence is also available. While adultery cannot be cited as a reason in itself for dissolving a civil partnership, it could be cited as an example of unreasonable behaviour.|$|E

25|$|Ironically, one of {{the plots}} called for Papen's murder by Austrian Nazi sympathisers as a pretext for a retaliatory {{invasion}} by Germany. On 25 January 1938, the Austrian police raided the Vienna headquarters of the Austrian Nazi Party, arresting Gauleiter Leopold Tavs, the deputy to Captain Leopold, and discovered a cache of arms. The plans laid out by Captain Leopold called for Papen to be assassinated by Austrian Nazis disguised as policemen, providing the pretext for a German invasion of Austria. The police raid set off the crisis that led directly to the Anschluss as the Austrian Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg now took up the invitation to meet Hitler to confront him with <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Austrian Nazis had been planning a putsch contrary to the Austro-German treaty of 1936. Papen told Schuschnigg that Hitler was willing to meet him around 15 February 1938 {{to discuss the issue}} raised by the discovery of the plans for a putsch.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have noted}} some peculiarities in the mummification process {{used on the}} Lady. The {{evisceration}} {{of the body and}} the stuffing of the torso with embalming materials were standard parts of the mummification process used during the entire reign of the 18th dynasty. This was not the case with the intact skull base and lack of effort to remove the brain, seen {{in the case of the}} Lady. This process had been used on early rulers of the 18th dynasty, as seen in the mummies currently identified with Thutmose I, Thutmose II, and Thutmose III. By the time of the later rulers of the 18th dynasty, when the Lady lived and died, the process had changed. All mummies from this later era contain some treatment of the brain, in attempts to remove it from the body. The mummification process used on the Lady seems like a throwback to an earlier era. Another peculiarity is <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people behind the mummification process were trying to repair and cover injured areas of the body. They used subcutaneous fillings and packs to remodel the injured left side of the face, the contralateral side of the face, and the right hip region. This was not part of the regular efforts of an embalmer.|$|E
500|$|A {{criminal}} case tried in 1826 brought Briggs wider notice. [...] An Oneida Indian living in Stockbridge {{was accused of}} murder.

500|$|Denys Page argues against {{attributing}} {{the poem}} to Sappho {{on the basis}} of its dialect, which he believes is not the Aeolic dialect used by Sappho. [...] He identifies three separate features which he does not believe are consistent with the archaic Lesbian dialect found elsewhere in the works of Sappho and Alcaeus. [...] Other scholars have argued against Sapphic authorship of the fragment on the basis that Hephaestion does not attribute the poem to her; that the meter is otherwise unknown in Sappho's fragments; and that the poem [...] "seems wrong for Sappho". [...] However, those who believe that Sappho did compose the poem argue that <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> poem was not in Aeolic is [...] "at best ambiguous", and find the other arguments put forward against Sappho's authorship unconvincing.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, {{represented}} by a new legal team, Green filed {{a request for a}} new trial on the basis of having been rendered incompetent by the psychiatric medications she was taking {{at the time of her}} hearings. She alleged that her original attorneys had failed to represent her adequately, instead focusing on avoiding a trial and the death penalty. She withdrew the request when prosecutors determined that they would seek the death penalty if a new trial was awarded. When, in 2004, the Kansas Supreme Court ruled the state's death penalty unconstitutional, she filed a second request for a new trial based on a claim of [...] "manifest injustice". Green's attorneys claimed that new scientific techniques invalidated <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fire had been caused by arson. The request was denied in February 2005.|$|E
500|$|With Truman as president, {{men like}} John R. Steelman, who was {{appointed}} chairman of the President's Scientific Research Board in October 1946, came to prominence. Bush's authority, both among scientists and politicians, suffered a rapid decline, though he remained a revered figure. In September 1949, he was appointed to head a scientific panel that included Oppenheimer to review <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union had tested its first atomic bomb. The panel concluded that it had, and this finding was relayed to Truman, who made the public announcement. Bush was outraged when a security hearing stripped Oppenheimer of his security clearance in 1954; he issued a strident attack on Oppenheimer's accusers in The New York Times. Alfred Friendly summed up the feeling of many scientists in declaring that Bush had become [...] "the Grand Old Man of American science".|$|E

500|$|The parties made submissions, {{and there}} was an oral hearing on 1 December 2006. All parties {{accepted}} that the relevant test to be applied was the test set out in the High Court case of DPP (Nauru) v Fowler, which sets out two preconditions for a retrial; the first requiring that the admissible evidence presented at trial be [...] "sufficiently cogent" [...] to support a conviction, the second requiring consideration of circumstances that would make it unjust to put the accused through a retrial. However this case had an unusual feature, namely that <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> prosecution would seek to use at a retrial had not been available at the original trial, through no fault of the prosecution, since although the interviews had been taken at that time they had not been published.

500|$|Priestley {{and other}} Dissenters blamed the {{government}} for the riots, believing that William Pitt and his supporters had instigated them; however, it seems from <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> riots were actually organized by local Birmingham officials. Some of the rioters acted in a co-ordinated fashion and seemed to be led by local officials during the attacks, prompting accusations of premeditation. Some Dissenters discovered that their homes were to be attacked several days before the rioters arrived, leading them to believe that there was a prepared list of victims. The [...] "disciplined nucleus of rioters", which numbered only thirty or so, directed the mob and stayed sober throughout the three to four days of rioting. Unlike the hundreds of others who joined in, they could not be bribed to stop their destructions. Essayist William Hazlitt's first published work was a letter to the Shrewsbury Chronicle, printed later in July 1791, condemning the Priestley riots; Priestley had been one of (then 13-year-old) Hazlitt's teachers.|$|E
