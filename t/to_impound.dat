He {{supported}} providing a two-year tax break to victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks and help grant citizenship to victims who were legal resident aliens. He supported gun control laws, outlawing racial profiling, and subsidies for Amtrak. He was the chief sponsor, along with U.S. Senator Sam Brownback, of the Darfur Accountability Act. He voted against the Iraq War Resolution. Corzine was the prime sponsor, along with fellow New Jersey U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg, of a federal version of John's Law, in memory of Navy Ensign John R. Elliott (a native of New Jersey), a U.S. Naval Academy graduate who {{was killed by a}} drunk driver. The legislation provides federal highway safety grant incentives to encourage states <b>to</b> <b>impound</b> the cars of DUI suspects. He was an early contributing blogger at The Huffington Post.|$|E

25|$|Some Presidents {{have claimed}} the {{authority}} under this clause <b>to</b> <b>impound</b> money appropriated by Congress. President Jefferson, for example, delayed {{the expenditure of}} money appropriated {{for the purchase of}} gunboats for over a year. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his successors sometimes refused outright to expend appropriated money. The Supreme Court, however, has held that impoundments without Congressional authorization are unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|The Belgian {{government}} {{assigned the}} study of the water supply to Bidaut, a chief engineer within the ministry, in September 1857. Originally the plan was <b>to</b> <b>impound</b> the upper Vesdre, in a joint project with the town of Eupen, also located within the watershed and at that time part of Prussia. These negotiations collapsed by 1864, and Bidaut {{turned his attention to the}} Gileppe, a tributary of the Vesdre entirely within the jurisdiction of the Belgian ministry. Throughout the 1860s, Bidaut undertook engineering studies for the reservoir with Donckier and Jamblinnes. Water distribution was studied by Cariez and Moulon. The site chosen for the dam is 1500 meters from the confluence of the Gileppe and Vesdre, where the valley narrows and the geological formation allowed for building the axis of the dam parallel to that of the vertical rock strata.|$|E
25|$|Doctors at Royaumont also {{undertook}} cutting-edge research, {{focusing on}} the treatment of gas gangrene. The doctors found X-ray and bacteriology for diagnosis and surgical debridement of affected tissue and antiserum therapy to be especially effective. Doctors at the facility believed the collaboration of different specialties was important in fighting infection and avoiding excess amputations. The hospital had a mobile X-ray car manufactured by Austins and purchased for £300. Installation of the X-ray equipment was assisted by Marie Curie and included water and electrical sources independent {{of the rest of}} the facility. The X-ray car was highly coveted; other hospitals in the area occasionally utilized it and the British military attempted <b>to</b> <b>impound</b> and keep the car for itself. In spite of their work, Dr. Ivans was restricted in her ability to publish and present her results. In 1918 she had to obtain permission from General Célestin Sieur of the French military medical services to publish her results, and she was not allowed to present her work directly to the Société de Chirurgie de Paris, her work being instead presented by a third party.|$|E

5000|$|A {{particular}} {{problem is the}} difficulty in enforcing ordinary laws, such as prohibitions on double parking. For example, the Autobahn 555 in Cologne, Germany was nicknamed the [...] "Diplomatenrennbahn" [...] (Diplomatic Raceway), back when Bonn was the capital of West Germany, because of the numerous diplomats that used to speed through the highway under diplomatic immunity. Certain cities, e.g., The Hague, have taken <b>to</b> <b>impounding</b> such cars rather than fining their owners. Diplomats' status does not guarantee the release of impounded cars.|$|R

500|$|It is {{customary}} for the Air Force <b>to</b> <b>impound</b> radar trackings involving possible {{litigation in}} cases of aviation accidents. In the civil litigation for damages, the United States Department of Justice explained that the tapes from the Air Force radar installation at King Salmon, Alaska pertinent to KAL007's flight in the Bethel area had been destroyed and could therefore not be supplied to the plaintiffs. At first Justice Department lawyer Jan Van Flatern stated that they were destroyed 15 days after the shootdown. Later, {{he said he had}} [...] "misspoken" [...] and changed the time of destruction to 30 hours after the event. A Pentagon spokesman concurred, saying that the tapes are re-cycled for reuse from 24–30 hours afterwards; the fate of KAL007 was known inside this timeframe.|$|E
500|$|The {{remnants}} of the convoy steamed on to meet the four minesweepers and seven motor minesweepers of the 17th Minesweeper Flotilla of the Malta Escort Force at 14:30. Melbourne Star, Port Chalmers and Rochester Castle reached Grand Harbour at Valletta at 16:30, where Operation Ceres, the immediate unloading of the ships began. Another air attack at dusk by 14 Ju 87s, sank Dorset but when the main body was within [...] of Malta, 18 Ju 88s were recalled {{in the face of}} 407 Spitfire sorties from the island. Penn tried to tow Ohio but the tanker was listing and snapped the tow line and in a later attack, a bomb hit the same area as a previous torpedo hit and broke Ohios keel. The last ship to arrive, Brisbane Star evaded a U-boat and managed to steam at [...] despite the damage to its bows. Off Tunisia, Brisbane Star was attacked by two SM.79 torpedo bombers, whose torpedoes turned out to be duds. The ship evaded Italian MAS boats; it was then boarded by the Sousse harbour master, who tried <b>to</b> <b>impound</b> the vessel until persuaded to relent and let the ship sail on after dark. Ledbury was attacked by two SM.79s but shot them down. Force X had turned for Gibraltar at 16:00 with the cruisers Charybdis, Kenya and five destroyers and Fliegerkorps II made a maximum effort against the force, which made it easier for the remaining merchant ships to reach Malta. Force X was attacked by 35 Ju 88s and 13 Ju 87s, achieving only a near-miss on Kenya for a loss of one Ju 88 and one Stuka. The Regia Aeronautica attacked with 15 bombers and 20 torpedo-bombers for no loss and during the afternoon, Force X met Force Z, the ships being attacked by aircraft, submarines and light craft and Foresight was scuttled by Tartar when it could no longer sail. Eskimo and Somali, carrying survivors from Manchester were the last to reach Gibraltar at 17:30 on 15 August.|$|E

40|$|In 1995, {{a county}} animal control service {{implemented}} a feral cat sterilization {{program with the}} goal of reducing the number of healthy cats euthanized, complaints, and the county’s costs. The service collected data from a 6 -year period {{both before and after the}} program’s implementation. The service totaled the numbers of both cat and dog impoundments, surgeries, adoptions, euthanasias, and complaints for each year; stan-dardized both sets of numbers on a per- 10, 000 -person basis to compare trends be-tween dogs and cats; and calculated estimated costs for neutering versus impounding and euthanizing the feral cats. Changing from a policy of euthanasia of feral cats to support for trap–neuter–return did not result in an increase in the number of com-plaints or cat impoundments. The percentage of impounded cats euthanized de-creased between the periods before and after the program began, and the percentage adopted increased. The ratio of complaints <b>to</b> <b>impounds</b> decreased between the 2 peri-ods, and the ratio of surgeries <b>to</b> <b>impounds</b> increased. Impoundments of cats were rel-atively steady in spite of the continually increasing human population. Euthanasias decreased for both cats and dogs since 1997. Since 1996, complaints decreased for both. Surgeries for both cats and dogs increased over the 12 years. Adoptions for cats and dogs increased greatly in fiscal year 1998 / 1999...|$|R

500|$|The Audiencia of Charcas {{took up the}} {{investigation}} of Reyes. [...] The Audencias, the judicial system of colonial Spain, had a wide degree of latitude and independence from the viceroy. [...] Charcas (now known as Sucre) was quite distant from the viceregal capital of Lima, amplifying the court's power even further. [...] In 1721, the audiencia sent judge José de Antequera y Castro to Asunción to dispense justice as he saw fit. [...] Antequera was a young rising star of the court, and even his fiercest critics wrote that he was likable, handsome, intelligent, and unusually well-educated for the time. [...] The Audiencia gave Antequera a sealed document to open if he found Reyes guilty. [...] The Audiencia and Antequera ordered Reyes to release the council members he had imprisoned and that he not interfere in {{the investigation}} in any way. [...] After interviewing the witnesses accusing Reyes of misdeeds, Antequera concluded that the evidence was so strong as to warrant the immediate arrest of Reyes in September 1721. [...] Antequera presented to the cabildo the sealed document he'd been given by the Audiencia. [...] The document gave Antequera the position of governor, which {{he took over the}} objections of Reyes' remaining supporters. [...] In April 1722, Antequera officially found Reyes guilty and dismissed him as governor, although Reyes immediately escaped Asunción on the same day the sentence was handed down. [...] Antequera proceeded <b>to</b> <b>impound</b> much of Reyes' property and also order the arrest of many of Reyes' friends and supporters, taking their property to be sold at public auction as well. [...] With all these actions, Antequera earned the support and adulation {{of the majority of the}} province, though he was hated by those who had done well under Reyes. [...] Antequera clinched his popularity by taking a stand against the hated Jesuits; he endorsed settlers' demands that the mission Indians be distributed to the encomienda, that secular (paid by the Spanish government) priests be put in charge of the Jesuit missions, and that a customs house be established to enforce limits on Jesuit exports of yerba mate. [...] To historian James Saeger, Antequera comes across as mostly well-meaning; he sincerely believed imposing the civil authority upon the independent Jesuit missions would benefit the Empire.|$|E

2500|$|Construction of the Canyon Dam <b>to</b> <b>impound</b> Lake Almanor at Big Meadows {{began in}} 1910. A rough one-way road was blazed from Greenville {{in the same}} year to {{transport}} workers and construction materials to the site, where a company town called Canyondam was established. Although originally conceived as a multiple-arch dam by its designers John S. Eastwood and H.H. Sinclair, concerns over the safety of this relatively new construction technique led to a change in the design. In March 1913, with over 40percent of the dam completed, a state commission declared the structure unsafe. The partly completed dam was dynamited and a new earthfill structure, containing over [...] of material, was built. The reservoir's name is a combination of the names of the daughters of Guy C.

2500|$|Pebble Mine [...] is {{the common}} name of a mineral {{exploration}} project investigating a very large porphyry copper, gold, and molybdenum mineral deposit in the Bristol Bay region of Southwest Alaska, near Lake Iliamna and Lake Clark. The proposal to mine the ore deposit, using large-scale operations and infrastructure, is controversial. Proponents argue that the mine will create jobs, provide tax revenue {{to the state of}} Alaska, and reduce American dependence on foreign sources of raw materials. Opponents argue that the mine would adversely affect the entire Bristol Bay watershed; and that the possible consequences to fish populations, when mining effluents escape planned containments, are simply too great of a risk. Much of this debate concerns the tentative plan <b>to</b> <b>impound</b> large amounts of water, waste rock, and mine tailings behind several earthen dams at the mine site.

The {{results suggest that the}} two trading venues, BATS and Turquoise, contribute more <b>to</b> <b>impounding</b> fundamental information, implying a shift in price dominance from traditional LSE to MTFs. In addition, the intra-day price contributions of MTFs are higher than those of LSE, especially during the first and last periods of the day.
