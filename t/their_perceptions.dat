25|$|An {{example of}} an {{instance}} may be that of an employee presenting to their co-workers. During the presentation, the person may stutter a word, upon {{which he or she}} may worry that other people significantly noticed and think that <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> of him or her as a presenter have been tarnished. This cognitive thought propels further anxiety which compounds with further stuttering, sweating, and, potentially, a panic attack.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{possible}} that someone can escape egocentric thinking. In one study, researchers had one group of participants list all factors that influenced their chances of experiencing a variety of events, and then a second group read the list. Those who read the list showed less optimistic bias in their own reports. It's possible that greater knowledge about others and <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> of their chances of risk bring the comparison group closer to the participant.|$|E

Participants were also asked about <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> of the issues at level crossings, and how predictable are trains arriving at crossings in their area. Knowing the times when trains are present at crossings is a known contributing factor to crashes at crossings, which can also be correlated with <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> of {{the usefulness of the}} system.|$|R
50|$|Students’ {{race and}} {{ethnicity}} can have an influence on <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> of the school’s climate. For instance, a study collected information from African American and white middle school students found differences in <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> of racial climate in their school. Therefore, African American, female, and lower income students have a more negative perception of the racial climate than white, middle class, and male students. Another study also conducted with middle school students found that students from a Hispanic/Latino background felt that relationships with teachers played a bigger role in <b>their</b> <b>perception</b> of community climate than relationships with students. In contrast, student relationships was a higher priority for Asian and white students.|$|R

25|$|Gilovich {{offers two}} {{different}} explanations for why people believe hot hands exist. The {{first is that}} a person may be biased towards looking for streaks before watching a basketball game. This bias would then affect <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> and recollection of the game (confirmation bias). The second explanation deals with people’s inability to recognize chance sequences. People expect chance sequences to alternate between the options more than they actually do. Chance sequences can seem too lumpy, and are thus dismissed as non-chance (clustering illusion).|$|E
25|$|In a small study {{conducted}} by University of Texas–Pan American and published in BMC Women's Health, 50 undergraduate women were surveyed by two popular male athletes on campus about <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> of sexual satisfaction and {{it was concluded that}} the width of a penis feels better than the length of a penis, when subjects are asked to choose between the two (size was left unspecified). It was also concluded that this may show that penis size overall affects sexual satisfaction since women chose between the two options they were given.|$|E

The priesthood also condemned Ikeda for abandoning the aggressive propagation style (shakubuku) that led to some social criticism of the lay group, though not the priesthood. Nichiren Shoshu Soka Gakkai was no longer considered a lay group, or hokkekō, of Shōshū, and its leaders, including Ikeda, were expelled. The priest also used Ikeda’s reverence of the Ode to Joy and his promotion of its performance, Ninth Symphony as evidence for non-Buddhist teachings.|$|E

25|$|O’Sullivan and {{her colleagues}} {{assessed}} 180 girls {{between the ages of}} 12 and 14 on <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> on what their first sexual encounters would be like; many girls reported feeling negative emotions towards sex before their first time. The researchers think this is because adolescent girls are taught that society views adolescent pre-marital sex in negative terms. When they reported positive feelings, the most commonly listed one was feeling attractive. This shows how many girls objectify their own bodies and often think about this before they think of their own sexual desires and needs.|$|E
25|$|When {{individuals}} assimilate new information, they incorporate it into {{an already}} existing framework without changing that framework. This may occur when individuals' experiences are aligned with their internal representations of the world, but may also occur as a failure to change a faulty understanding; for example, they may not notice events, may misunderstand input from others, or may decide that an event is a fluke and is therefore unimportant as information about the world. In contrast, when individuals' experiences contradict their internal representations, they may change <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> of the experiences to fit their internal representations.|$|E

Many can imagine the actual sizes of objects and distances between objects. It is common for patients suffering from micropsia {{to be able to}} indicate true size and distance despite their inability to perceive objects as they actually are. One specific patient was able to indicate the dimensions of specific objects with her hands. She was also able to estimate the distances between two objects and between an object and herself. She succeeded in indicating horizontal, vertical, and 45 degree positions and did not find it difficult to search for an object in a cluttered drawer, indicating that her figure-ground discrimination was intact despite suffering from micropsia.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} {{matching}} hedge funds to investors {{has traditionally been}} fairly opaque, with investments often driven by personal connections or recommendations of portfolio managers. Many funds disclose their holdings, strategy, and historic performance relative to market indices, giving investors some idea of how their money is being allocated, although individual holdings are often not disclosed. Investors are often drawn to hedge funds {{by the possibility of}} realizing significant returns, or hedging against volatility in the market. The complexity and fees associated with hedge funds are causing some to exit the market – Calpers, the largest pension fund in the US, announced plans to completely divest from hedge funds in 2014. Some services are attempting to improve matching between hedge funds and investors: HedgeZ is designed to allow investors to easily search and sort through funds; iMatchative aims to match investors to funds through algorithms that factor in an investor's goals and behavioral profile, in hopes of helping funds and investors understand the how <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> and motivations drive investment decisions.|$|E

He excelled at basketball, and enjoyed cooking: [...] "I used to have buddies come over after {{kindergarten}} and I'd cook them food. I prided myself in taking whatever was in the fridge and turning it into lasagna." [...] He initially wanted to attend a military academy and move to Japan to become a ninja. At an early age, his father introduced him to films like The Elephant Man, which inspired him to be an actor.

500|$|Language and {{linguistic}} barriers {{are a major}} theme in The Word for World Is Forest, something exemplified by the title. In contrast to other Hainish universe novels such as The Left Hand of Darkness, The Word for World Is Forest portrays a communication gap that the protagonists are never able to bridge. Both the native Athsheans and the loggers have languages that reflect <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> of reality, but {{they are unable to}} find a common language. In the native Athshean language, the word [...] "Athshe" [...] means both [...] "forest" [...] and [...] "world", demonstrating the close link that the Athsheans have to the forest and their planet. It is noted by Lyubov that the Athsheans believe [...] "the substance of their world was not earth, but forest". The language used by the Athsheans during conversations similarly show their interconnectedness and dependence on their ecosystem through the use of forest related metaphors.|$|E
500|$|Scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout cites [...] "The Couple" [...] as {{an example}} of Angelou's {{practice}} of subtly including more than one level of meaning in her poems, of her ability to translate her personal experience into political discourse, and her placement of themes of racism and liberation. [...] Angelou combines liberation ideology and poetic technique to challenge society's concepts of gender identity, especially in how it affects women. [...] She varies the length of the poem's lines, beginning in the first stanza and continuing throughout the poem, to convey ambiguity and doubt, and to demand that the reader question <b>their</b> <b>perceptions</b> of gender and power. [...] "The Couple", starting in its second stanza, attacks class-based ideals of masculinity in society. [...] The poem ends by demanding that the social constructs surrounding gender and class end, and insists that human survival depends upon recognizing shared emotions and experience, regardless of one's gender or position in society.|$|E
