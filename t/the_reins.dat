5|$|Traditionally, {{illustrations}} of Auriga represent it as a chariot and its driver. The charioteer holds a goat {{over his left}} shoulder and has two kids under his left arm; he holds <b>the</b> <b>reins</b> to the chariot {{in his right hand}}. However, depictions of Auriga have been inconsistent over the years. <b>The</b> <b>reins</b> in his right hand have also been drawn as a whip, though Capella is almost always over his left shoulder and the Kids under his left arm. The 1488 atlas Hyginus deviated from this typical depiction by showing a four-wheeled cart driven by Auriga, who holds <b>the</b> <b>reins</b> of two oxen, a horse, and a zebra. Jacob Micyllus depicted Auriga in his Hyginus of 1535 as a charioteer with a two-wheeled cart, powered by two horses and two oxen. Arabic and Turkish depictions of Auriga varied wildly from those of the European Renaissance; one Turkish atlas depicted the stars of Auriga as a mule, called Mulus clitellatus by Johann Bayer. One unusual representation of Auriga, from 17th-century France, showed Auriga as Adam kneeling on the Milky Way, with a goat wrapped around his shoulders.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> bradoon <b>rein</b> {{should be}} wider than <b>the</b> <b>rein</b> used on <b>the</b> curb bit and in sport horse {{disciplines}} {{is often a}} bit more grippy (laced or, less often, rubber reins are popular), while <b>the</b> curb <b>rein</b> is thinner and smooth. This {{makes it easy for}} the rider to distinguish the two by feel. The extra grip provided by <b>the</b> snaffle <b>rein</b> also helps prevent the horse from pulling it through the rider's hands, which would make <b>the</b> curb <b>rein</b> shorter in comparison and encourage the rider to over-use <b>the</b> curb <b>rein.</b>|$|R
5|$|After {{the death}} of Vladimir Lenin in January 1924, {{there was a brief}} power {{struggle}} in the Soviet Union, from which Joseph Stalin rose to take <b>the</b> <b>reins</b> of power. Armenian society and its economy were changed by Stalin and his fellow Moscow policymakers. In 1936, the TSFSR was dissolved under Stalin's orders and the socialist republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia were established instead. For the Armenian people, conditions grew worse under Stalin's rule. In a period of twenty-five years, Armenia was industrialized and educated under strictly prescribed conditions, and nationalism was harshly suppressed.|$|E
5|$|At the Battle of Lewes in 1264, {{the rebellious}} barons, led by Simon de Montfort, had {{defeated}} the royal army and taken King Henry III captive. For the next year, <b>the</b> <b>reins</b> of government were in Montfort's hands, but his support {{soon began to}} crumble. On 4 August 1265, Montfort faced an army led by Prince Edward (later King Edward I) and the powerful Earl of Gloucester, who had recently defected to the royalist side, at the Battle of Evesham. The battle resulted in a complete royal victory; Montfort was killed, and King Henry III was restored to full power.|$|E
5|$|By late 2004, Brokaw {{had retired}} from his {{anchoring}} duties at NBC, ceding <b>the</b> <b>reins</b> to Brian Williams; Rather planned {{to step down}} in March 2005. Jennings and ABC saw an opportunity to gain viewers, and initiated a publicity blitz touting the anchor's foreign reporting experience. However, despite having almost always reported {{from the scene of}} any major news story, Jennings was sidelined by an upper respiratory infection in late December 2004; he was forced to anchor from New York during the aftermath of the Asian tsunami, while his competitors traveled to the region. For Jennings, the situation was agonizing.|$|E
5000|$|Action: The baucher has an eggbutt-like ring at the {{mouthpiece}} for <b>the</b> <b>rein,</b> with an upper cheek {{that has a}} ring at its end, to which the cheekpieces of the bridle are attached. The mouthpiece of a true Baucher does not slide on its ring, though there are Baucher-like designs that do. This bit lies flat against the horse's face, is fixed in the mouth and concentrates pressure on the bars. Contrary to common belief, the bit does not exert poll pressure unless it is put onto the bridle upside-down. This bit is usually falsely described as creating poll pressure. Most baucher bits don't. In order for it {{to put pressure on}} the poll, the ring which <b>the</b> <b>rein</b> attaches to, needs to have a drawn-out oblong shape so that <b>the</b> <b>rein</b> stays at a certain position on the ring. If the ring is oblong, <b>the</b> <b>rein</b> will want to stay at one end, and thus pulls this end up towards the hand/rein. If the ring is round, so that the distance from the mouth bars to <b>the</b> <b>rein</b> is constant at all angles, <b>the</b> <b>rein</b> will slide.|$|R

5|$|From Boston, Edwards {{moved to}} New York {{to stay for}} some ten years, {{performing}} on stage and participating in insect studies. He {{was active in the}} Brooklyn and New York Entomological Societies. In 1881, he co-founded and edited a butterfly enthusiast's periodical entitled Papilio, named for the genus Papilio in the swallowtail butterfly family, Papilionidae. Edwards served as editor until January 1884 when he gave <b>the</b> <b>reins</b> to his friend Eugene Murray-Aaron of Philadelphia. Papilio was published until 1885 when its subscription base was merged into the more general Entomologia Americana, published by the Brooklyn Entomological Society.|$|E

The other demon is grabbing <b>the</b> <b>reins</b> of the horse and attacking Khandoba with a club as Khandoba is dismounting the horse and attacking the demon with his sword. In other representations, Khandoba is seen seated on a horse with the heads of demons trod under the horse's hooves or their heads under Khandoba's knees.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Rein</b> da Curnera (in Curnerarhein) {{is a right}} {{tributary}} of the Anterior Rhine {{and one of the}} main tributaries of the Rhine (see Sources of the Rhine). It is fed from multiple sources and glaciers {{at the southern end of}} the valley. The river is about 8 km long and flows north through the Val Curnera. Approximately in the middle of its route, a dam was constructed by Kraftwerke Vorderrhein AG (the local hydropower company), which formed Lai da Curnera. At this point, <b>the</b> <b>Rein</b> da Curnera takes up a left tributary, <b>the</b> <b>Rein</b> da Maighels.|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to their previous season, in 2004 the Highlanders conceded 44 tries, 12 {{more than in}} 2003, but scored nine more tries then in 2003. Not only did {{they have a new}} head coach, but also 13 new players in their squad, and a new captain after Anton Oliver took over <b>the</b> <b>reins</b> from Tane Randell. This all contributed to them finishing the season ninth, after winning four, and losing six of their eleven matches.|$|E

5|$|Season 2006 saw the {{retirement}} of captain Robbie Kearns, the emergence of talented rookie halfback Cooper Cronk, taking <b>the</b> <b>reins</b> from Matt Orford, and the recruitment of hard-man Michael Crocker. Contrary to expectation, 2006 was a standout year for the Melbourne team, winning their first Minor Premiership. Melbourne only lost four games in the season, making them outright leaders by four wins. They {{went on to win}} their two finals matches, and were favourites in the 2006 NRL Grand Final, but lost 15–8 to the Brisbane Broncos, in a match where controversial refereeing decisions against Melbourne caused much media coverage.|$|E
5000|$|Depending on the {{position}} of the rider's hands, the standard Kimblewick has different effects when <b>the</b> <b>rein</b> is allowed to slide freely along the curved portion of the D-ring. If the rider's hands are held high, there is no leverage effect. If the rider's hands are low, the slight leverage effect can be used. However, one popular design, the Uxeter Kimblewick, has slots in the curved portion of the ring, so that <b>the</b> <b>rein</b> may be fixed into one position. This increases the curb effect, especially when <b>the</b> <b>rein</b> is placed on the lower of the two slots.|$|R
