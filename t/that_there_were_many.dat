5|$|Work by Dodson (1975) {{recognized}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> less taxa {{present in}} Alberta. Tetragonosaurus {{was found to}} be juveniles of Corythosaurus or Lambeosaurus. T. erectofrons was assigned to Corythosaurus based largely on biometric information. The only non-typic specimen of Tetragonosaurus, assigned to T. erectofrons, was found later to be referable to Hypacrosaurus, although the holotype of the species was still found to be assignable to Corythosaurus.|$|E

5|$|The 1952 {{classification}} by French zoologist J. Alloiteau {{was built}} on these earlier systems but included more microstructural observations and did not involve the anatomical characters of the polyp. Alloiteau recognized eight suborders. In 1942, W.H. Bryan and D. Hill {{stressed the importance of}} microstructural observations by proposing that stony corals begin skeletal growth by configuring calcification centers, which are genetically derived. Therefore, diverse patterns of calcification centers are vital to classification. Alloiteau later showed that established morphological classifications were unbalanced and <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> examples of convergent evolution between fossils and recent taxa.|$|E

5|$|In late November 2007, a Hyderabad-based company named Goldstone Technologies {{acquired}} the film negative rights to 14Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, including Mayabazar (1957) and Pelli Chesi Choodu, to release digitally re-mastered versions in colour. The remastered and colourised version of Mayabazar {{was released in}} January 2010 and performed well in theatres, but Goldstone Technologies decided not to remaster the remaining 14 films, including Pelli Chesi Choodu; the company {{said most of the}} producers who sold the rights of the negatives to television channels lost control over them. Goldstone added <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> legal issues over ownership and copyright whenever other producers tried to do something on their own.|$|E
5|$|In previews, {{publications}} such as IGN and GameSpot {{noted that}} the graphics had been improved, and <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> new characters and locations. The new minigames were previewed, and IGN pointed out that they offered enough complexity {{to back up the}} simple gameplay. In an interview with GameSpot, Ted Price stated that the emphasis for the title was on the new critters, but that Spyro would not be left behind in the story. Year of the Dragon also implemented crack protection, in addition to the copy protection previous games had contained. This helped prevent hackers from cracking the game until two months after release.|$|E

5|$|No.410 Squadron was {{the third}} RCAF night fighter {{squadron}} to be formed and was equipped with the Boulton Paul Defiant. In May 1942 these were replaced by the Bristol Beaufighter, and in October {{of the same year}} these were in turn replaced with De Havilland Mosquito Mk IIs, with which the first victory for the squadron was claimed. No.410 Squadron was acknowledged as the top-scoring night fighter unit in RAF Second Tactical Air Force in the period between D-Day and VE Day, although No. 409 Squadron RCAF can now make a similar claim, on the basis <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> victories quickly counted up during 1944 and 1945.|$|E
5|$|Robin Pierson of The TV Critic {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, rating the episode a 67/100, calling {{it one of}} the most densely packed pilots on television. He {{mentioned}} that it was entertaining but said <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> jokes that followed the quality does not win out over quantity saying. He compared Peter to Homer Simpson and he compared the show to The Simpsons and King of the Hill. He criticized the amount of unfunny jokes while he praised the surreal moments. At the end of his review he stated that Family Guy was a different kind of animated comedy which set out to do jokes that other cartoons couldn’t do, also mentioning that the show had promise to become really funny.|$|E
5|$|The HP.80 and Avro's Type 698 {{were chosen}} as the best two of the {{proposed}} designs to B.35/46, and orders for two prototypes of each were placed. It was recognised, however, <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> unknowns associated with both designs, and an order was also placed for Vickers' design, which became the Valiant. Although not fully meeting {{the requirements of the}} specification, the Valiant design posed little risk of failure and could therefore reach service earlier. The HP.80's crescent wing was tested on a ⅓-scale glider, the HP.87, and a heavily modified Supermarine Attacker, which was given the Handley Page HP.88 designation. The HP.88 crashed on 26 August 1951 after completing only about thirty flights and little useful data was gained during its brief two months of existence. By the time the HP.88 was ready, the HP.80 wing had changed such that the former was no longer representative. The design of the HP.80 had sufficiently advanced that the loss of the HP.88 had little effect on the programme.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, Martill {{suggested}} that the odontoid {{at the tip of}} the lower jaw of Istiodactylus served to fill the space where no tooth was present. This completed an arc-like bite that would have been necessary to sever morsels that would otherwise remain attached by a thread. Martill stated that few other animals are known with teeth similar to those of Istiodactylus, but pointed out the similarity to various types of sharks and reptiles, including the cookiecutter shark, which takes circular bites from fish as well as prey much larger than itself (including whales). Istiodactylus may also have taken circular bites from prey larger than itself (such as dinosaurs and crocodiles), but perhaps also from fish, for example by snapping at their backs near the water surface. Martill stated <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>many</b> differences between the skull of Istiodactylus and extant scavengers, such as the lack of a sharp, pointed beak, which could have made it less capable of tearing flesh, but the long neck may have provided enough pulling power, and the claws on the fingers may have been used to manipulate carcasses. Martill agreed that Istiodactylus was most likely a scavenger that would have used its robust teeth to scrape meat from bones, as indicated by wear-facets on the tooth-tips (he proposed that scratch-marks should be looked for on dinosaur bones). He also {{suggested that}} if they were scraping away the last flesh from a carcass, like marabou storks, they would have been in the back of the queue for access to it.|$|E
