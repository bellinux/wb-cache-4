40|$|A novel low-mast {{low-power}} Terrestrial Digital Audio Broadcasting (<b>T-DAB)</b> single frequency {{network topology}} is described and evaluated in this paper. For this purpose, a pilot network (band III and L-band) {{was constructed in}} Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The performance of the band III pilot network (channel 12 B) is compared with the existing traditional high-power high-mast <b>T-DAB</b> network (channel 12 C) of the public service broadcaster. An important goal is to investigate whether the pilot network can co-exist with an existing traditional <b>T-DAB</b> network. The field trial shows that a gap filler can effectively neutralize the adjacent channel interference of the pilot network on the existing <b>T-DAB</b> network. Moreover, the L-band pilot network is compared with both band III networks by assessing the indoor coverage of every network. For estimation of the indoor coverage, 34 objects were investigated. Both the indoor penetration loss for band III and L-band was determined for each object. Indoor coverage in a region is reached if 95 % of the buildings or more have indoor coverage. Using this definition, the loss for band III is 21. 6 dB and for L-band 24. 6 dB. As a result we consider the indoor penetration loss values reported in literature as too optimistic. Also other parameters of the pilot network were measured, such as the frequency re-use distance...|$|E
40|$|Between October 2004 and July 2006, the University of Twente {{carried out}} a {{technical}} <b>T-DAB</b> field trial in Amsterdam which was commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. For this trial, a low-power low-mast <b>T-DAB</b> pilot network was constructed both for band III (channel 12 B) and the L-band (channel LH). This field trial provided evidence that a low-power low-mast network topology can coexist with a high-mast high-power network in an adjacent channel. Using gap fillers, {{the holes in the}} service area of the high-mast high-power network can be neutralized effectively. Other possible solutions such as a smaller vertical opening angle of the antenna system were not investigated. The minimum power level of the gap fillers should be 24 dB below the output power of the low-mas...|$|E
40|$|September 2007. The Arrangement {{contains}} {{technical characteristics}} for <b>T-DAB</b> and multimedia systems {{to operate in}} the L-band. Since the adoption of MA 02 revCO 07, a number of systems have been identified as potential user of the L-band for which the characteristics may slightly differ from those given in the Arrangement. Therefore, this ECC Report provides additional technical characteristics relating to: Hand-held reception of TV, audio, datacast and multimedia services Programme Making and Special Events (PMSE). It also indicates that new systems are under development such as Next Generation Handheld (NGH) which may need to be further considered at a later stage. In addition, it provides additional guidance on the maximum allowable PFD levels of the satellite networks to protect <b>T-DAB</b> systems for coordination with S-DAB systems in the sub-band 1467 MHz to 1479. 5 MHz. Finally, the report provides guidance to administrations in the application of the envelop concept in the framework of th...|$|E
40|$|In every {{wireless}} system, {{the weakest}} link determines {{the performance of}} the network. In this paper the Radio Frequency (RF) performance of both band III and L-band Terrestrial Digital Audio Broadcasting (<b>T-DAB)</b> consumer receivers are discussed. The receivers have been tested based on the EN 50248 standard. The test results show that the average consumer receiver for band III meets the requirements set by EN 50248, except for the non-adjacent interferer experiments. In this experiment, the average consumer receiver performs up to 10 dB worse than required. In addition, the experiments reveal that there is a large difference in performance between consumer receivers. Besides band III, also L-band consumer receivers have been evaluated. The results of the L-band experiments show that the consumer receivers are not capable of decoding a DAB signal with a COST 207 rural area channel model in case of <b>T-DAB</b> mode IV. Network operators should for this reason use mode II for the L-band and should expect a larger influence of non-adjacent interference on receiver performance in band III than anticipated based on EN 50248...|$|E

The two systems {{are using the}} L-Band but the systems characteristics should protect them from each other except for some cases. It is the intention of this paper to provide clear guidelines for full compatibility and therefore avoid mutual interference. The calculation of the coordination distance, that is the minimum tolerable distance between the two transmitter stations, is based upon ITU-R protection ratios and an iterative method that we attempt to detail in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Master’s {{thesis is}} focused on SFN (Single Frequency Network) and MFN (Multi Frequency Network) {{networks}} design in digital television broadcasting based on DVB-T standard and digital radio broadcasting based on <b>T-DAB</b> standard. First part of the thesis {{is focused on}} the theoretical description of the MPEG- 2 TS transmission, its propagation from transmitter across free space, to be decoded in the DVB-T receiver. In the second, practical part of the thesis, basic parameters of a software package for broadcast network design in RadioLab, RadioBase and Sítě SFN are introduced and the results are displayed on the digital terrain map and morphologic map. Within solution of this thesis was created signal coverage model of DVB-T digital transmitters in entire area of the Czech Republic, so called networks no. 1 - 4, according to its status in spring 2010, and its future expansion, which is known from TPP (Technical Plan of Conversion) document. At the conclusion of thesis there were made experiments with the modeling of transmitters’ radiated power, guard interval selection and location of DVB-T transmitters in the SFN network...|$|E
