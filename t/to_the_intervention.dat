5|$|In 866, a major Arab raid along Dalmatia struck Budva and Kotor, {{and then}} laid siege to Dubrovnik in 867. The city appealed to Byzantine Emperor Basil the Macedonian, who responded by sending {{over one hundred}} ships. Finally, the 866–867 Saracens' siege of Dubrovnik, which lasted fifteen months, was raised due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> of Basil I, who sent a fleet {{under the command of}} Niketas Oryphas in relief of the city. After this {{successful}} intervention, the Byzantine navy sailed along the coast collecting promises of loyalty to the empire from the Dalmatian cities. The damage done by Saracens is not known, but the fact that Dubrovnik managed to survive a fifteen-month-long siege, proves how well the city was fortified.|$|E
5|$|Manchester City's first {{transfer}} {{business of}} the season brought goalkeeper Ken Mulhearn to the club from Stockport County on 21 September, a deal that involved City's back-up goalkeeper Alan Ogley moving in the opposite direction. Harry Dowd kept goal in the next match, a 1–0 defeat at Arsenal, but then dislocated a finger, prompting a debut for Mulhearn in the season's first Manchester derby. Mulhearn was reputedly so nervous before the match that Allison locked him in the medical room until he calmed down. Colin Bell scored the opener after five minutes, but two Bobby Charlton goals meant a win for Manchester United. In {{the second half of}} the match, Bowles exchanged punches with Brian Kidd, though neither man was sent off, largely thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> of their respective captains. The derby loss was followed by a third consecutive defeat, at Sunderland.|$|E

Khryse's daughter is reluctantly returned to her father and the Akhaian leader takes the young warrior Akhilles' concubine as reparation for his loss. The furious Akhilles refuses to continue fighting. Menelaus and Paris duel each other, but Paris flees the fight due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> of Helen and Aphrodite.|$|E

30|$|A {{number of}} {{procedures}} {{were used to}} achieve fidelity of implementation. The control condition was regular course instruction, and occurred in the course (Fall 2011) prior <b>to</b> when <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> was administered (Spring 2012 and Fall 2012). After the control semester was completed, and prior <b>to</b> beginning <b>the</b> <b>intervention,</b> <b>the</b> first author met with <b>the</b> teachers <b>to</b> go through <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> materials. Next, <b>the</b> first author obtained the lecture slides from the teachers from the Fall 2011 course, inserted <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> slides, and sent them back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> teachers.

5|$|Convinced that Khiêm was {{involved}} in the plot, Khánh had him exiled to Washington as ambassador, and eased General Dương Văn Minh out of the political scene, thereby removing the other two nominal members of the ruling triumvirate. However, concerned that Kỳ and Thi had become too powerful, Khánh had Phát and Đức acquitted at their military trial in an attempt to use them as political counterweights. Despite his survival, the coup was seen by the historian George McTurnan Kahin as the start of Khánh's ultimate political decline. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> of Kỳ and Thi, Khánh was now indebted to them, and in an attempt to maintain his power in the face of increasing military opposition, he tried to court support from Buddhist civilian activists, who supported negotiations with the communists to end the Vietnam War. As the Americans were strongly opposed to such policies, relations with Khánh became increasingly strained and he was deposed in February 1965 with US connivance.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel de Rojas {{was still}} in Olancho, and was told by native {{informants}} of new Spanish arrivals in Trujillo. He sent a letter and gifts with messengers, who met Gonzalo de Sandoval, who was imposing Spanish control over Papayeca at that time, then proceeded onwards to Cortés at Trujillo. Cortés at first responded in a friendly manner to Rojas' overtures. Rojas' party was attempting to expand Hernández de Córdoba's Nicaraguan territory; upon meeting native resistance his men began pillaging the district and enslaving the inhabitants. Upon receiving complaints from native informants, Cortés dispatched Sandoval with ten cavalry to hand papers to Rojas, ordering {{him out of the}} territory, and to release any Indians and their goods that he had seized. Sandoval was under orders to either capture Rojas, or expel him from Honduras, but in the event was unable to do either, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> of other Spaniards present who tried to calm the situation. While the two groups were still gathered, Rojas received orders from Francisco Hernández de Córdoba to return to Nicaragua to assist him against his rebellious captains, while Sandoval returned to face Cortés' displeasure.|$|E
5|$|In September, the Catholic Generals Lâm Văn Phát and Dương Văn Đức {{launched}} a coup after being demoted by Khánh {{in response to}} Buddhist pressure; Phát was a well-known Diệm loyalist. They were supported by the Đại Việt, Khiêm and Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo. While Thảo was also a Catholic, he was an undetected communist spy who tried to foment infighting at every opportunity. The coup failed and Khánh exiled Khiêm to Washington as ambassador, and his close friend Thảo was sent along as press attache. Concerned that Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ and General Nguyễn Chánh Thi—who had put down the coup attempt for him—had become too powerful, Khánh had Phát and Duc acquitted in their military trial {{in an effort to}} use them as a political counterweight. However, the coup was seen as the start of Khánh's ultimate political decline. Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>intervention</b> of Kỳ and Thi, Khánh was now indebted to them. In an attempt to maintain his political power in the face of increasing opposition from within the junta, he tried to court support from Buddhist civilian activists, who supported negotiations with the communists to end the war. As the Americans were strongly opposed to such policies, relations with Khánh became increasingly strained.|$|E

40|$|In this {{multidisciplinary}} study, an Internet-based tool Was used {{to encourage}} households (N = 189) {{to reduce their}} direct (gas, electricity and fuel) and indirect energy use (embedded in the production, transportation and disposal of consumer goods). A combination of tailored information, goal setting (5 %), and tailored feedback was used. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine whether this combination of interventions Would result in (i) changes in direct and indirect energy use, (ii) changes in energy-related behaviors, and (iii) changes in behavioral antecedents (i. e. knowledge). After 5 months, households exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> combination of <b>interventions</b> saved 5. 1 %, while households in the control group used 0. 7 % more energy. Households exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> saved significantly more direct energy than households in the control group did. No difference in indirect energy savings emerged. Households exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> adopted a number of energy-saving behaviors during the course of the study, whereas households in the control group did so to a lesser extent. Households exposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>interventions</b> had significantly higher knowledge levels of energy conservation than the control group had. It is argued that if <b>the</b> aim is <b>to</b> effectively encourage household energy conservation, it is necessary to examine changes in energy use, energy-related behaviors and behavioral antecedents.
