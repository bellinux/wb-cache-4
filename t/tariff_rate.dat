5|$|The {{disastrous}} {{effects of}} the Smoot–Hawley tariff proved difficult for Herbert Hoover's 1932 re-election campaign. Franklin D. Roosevelt became the 32nd U.S. president and the Democratic Party worked to reverse trade protectionism in favor of trade liberalization. As an alternative to cutting tariffs across all imports, Democrats advocated for trade reciprocity. The U.S. Congress passed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934, aimed at restoring global trade and reducing unemployment. The legislation expressly authorized President Roosevelt to negotiate bilateral trade agreements and reduce tariffs considerably. If a country agreed to cut tariffs on certain commodities, the U.S. would institute corresponding cuts to promote trade between the two nations. Between 1934 and 1947, the U.S. negotiated 29 such agreements and the average <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> decreased by approximately one third during this same period. The legislation contained an important most-favored-nation clause, through which tariffs were equalized to all countries, such that trade agreements would not result in preferential or discriminatory tariff rates with certain countries on any particular import, due to the difficulties and inefficiencies associated with differential tariff rates. The clause effectively generalized tariff reductions from bilateral trade agreements, ultimately reducing worldwide tariff rates.|$|E

Our findings are as follow. Firstly, the omission of bilateral <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> seems {{not to be so}} serious in terms of omitted-variable biases because the coefficients for the usual gravity variables do not change before or after their inclusion. Secondly, while the widely-used dummy variable of regional trade agreement could not play an alternative role in place of <b>tariff</b> <b>rates,</b> the inclusion of time-invariant pair fixed effects in addition to the time-variant importer fixed effects and exporter fixed effects accounts for the omission of <b>tariff</b> <b>rates.</b> The inclusion of those fixed effects makes the coefficient for bilateral <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> insignificant.

Our main findings are as follows. Exports of finished machinery products are {{negatively associated with}} not only the importer's <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> on finished machinery products but also the exporter's <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> on machinery parts. Similarly, exports of machinery parts are negatively associated with not only the importer's <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> on machinery parts but also the exporter's <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> on finished machinery products. These results imply that tariff reduction in only one production process in an industry {{has the potential to}} drastically change the magnitude of trade in the whole industry.

As has been noted, the average <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> was cut greatly in two steps, in September 1990 and March 1991. Quantitative restrictions were eliminated, and the tariff structure was greatly simplified. Effective protection was brought down to a lower level than at any point since the mid1960s, with a more coherent structure that left much less room for distorted incentives.|$|E

25|$|The {{preceding}} Belaúnde {{administration had}} started Peru {{on the path}} of protection to promote industry, and in this respect the Velasco government reinforced rather than reversed the existing strategy. Beyond the usual recourse to high tariffs, Velasco's government adopted the Industrial Community Law of 1970 that gave any industrialist on the register of manufacturers the right to demand prohibition of any imports competing with his products. No questions of exceptionally high costs of production, poor product quality, or monopolistic positions fostered by excluding import competition were allowed to get in the way. Before the succeeding government of General Francisco Morales Bermúdez Cerrutti (1975–80) began to clean up the battery of protective exclusions in 1978, the average <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> reached 66 percent, accompanied by quantitative restrictions on 2,890 specific tariff positions.|$|E

25|$|Scholars {{find that}} China has {{attained}} {{a degree of}} openness that is unprecedented among large and populous nations, with competition from foreign goods in almost every sector of the economy. Foreign investment helped to greatly increase quality, knowledge and standards, especially in heavy industry. China's experience supports the assertion that globalization greatly increases wealth for poor countries. Throughout the reform period, the government reduced tariffs and other trade barriers, with the overall <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> falling from 56% to 15%. By 2001, less than 40% of imports were subject to tariffs and only 9 percent of import were subject to licensing and import quotas. Even during the early reform era, protectionist policies were often circumvented by smuggling. When China joined the WTO, it agreed to considerably harsher conditions than other developing countries. Trade has increased from under 10% of GDP to 64% of GDP over the same period. China is considered the most open large country; By 2005, China’s average statutory tariff on industrial products was 8.9 percent. For Argentina, Brazil, India, and Indonesia, the respective percentage figures are 30.9, 27.0, 32.4, and 36.9 percent.|$|E

By 2012 the industry was producing 20% as much tea as Taiwan and 3.5% as much as Japan. Green tea is not as popular as coffee or other types of Korean teas in modern South Korea.

2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the {{maquiladora}} program {{was in place}} far before NAFTA, in some sense dating {{all the way back}} to 1965. [...] A maquiladora manufacturer operates by importing raw materials into Mexico either tariff free (NAFTA) or at a reduced rate on a temporary basis (18 months) and then using Mexico's relatively less expensive labor costs to produce finished goods for export. [...] Prior to NAFTA maquiladora companies importing raw materials from anywhere in the world were given preferential tariff rates by the Mexican government so long as the finished good was for export. [...] The US, prior to NAFTA, allowed Maquiladora manufactured goods to be imported into the US with the <b>tariff</b> <b>rate</b> only being applied to the value of non US raw materials used to produce the good, thus reducing the tariff relative to other countries. [...] NAFTA has eliminated all tariffs on goods between the two countries, but for the maquiladora industry significantly increased the tariff rates for goods sourced outside of NAFTA.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{interaction}} between upstream firms and downstream firms in a two-region general equilibrium model. In many countries, lower <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> are set for intermediate manufactured goods and higher <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> are set for final manufactured goods. The derived results imply that such settings of <b>tariff</b> <b>rates</b> tend to preserve a symmetric spread of upstream and downstream firms, and continuing tariff reduction may cause core-periphery structures. In the {{case in which the}} circular causality between upstream and downstream firms is focused as agglomeration forces, the present model is fully solved. Thus, we find that (1) the present model displays, at most, three interior steady states, (2) when the asymmetric steady-states exist, they are unstable and (3) location displays hysteresis when the transport costs of intermediate manufactured goods are sufficiently high. 2009 年度調査研究報告...|$|R
