5|$|Bradley {{was inaugurated}} December 10, 1895. During his term, Republicans {{controlled}} <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> House of Representatives, while Democrats controlled <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> Senate. This led to infighting {{between the two}} houses of the General Assembly and between the General Assembly and the governor. On joint votes, such as the election of U.S. Senators, the parties were even with sixty-eight members each; two Populists were also members of the Assembly, one who supported the Democrats and another who supported the Republicans.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge's first speech favored {{allowing}} <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> Colonization Society {{to use the}} House chamber; later, {{he advocated}} directing Congress to establish an African freedmen colony, and to meet the costs of transporting settlers there. Funding internal improvements was traditionally a Whig stance, but Breckinridge advocated conducting a state geologic survey, making <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> River more navigable, chartering a turnpike, incorporating a steamboat company, and funding <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> Lunatic Asylum.

He took {{a leave of absence}} on April 18, 1816, and by August 1816, had resigned his seat to accept an appointment as a circuit court judge.|$|E
5|$|Clark's ruling drew a {{resolution}} of condemnation from <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> General Assembly. He was summoned {{to appear before the}} legislature, but opted to respond to their charges in writing instead. Incensed, the legislature attempted to removed him from office, but the vote of 5935 fell short of the needed two-thirds majority. In October 1823, Clark's decision was upheld by <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> Court of Appeals; that decision touched off the Old Court-New Court controversy, wherein the legislature attempted to abolish the Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} more sympathetic court.|$|E

Later, the General Assembly chose Dixon to fill the unexpired Senate term of Henry Clay. He served from September 1, 1852, to March 3, 1855, and did not stand for re-election. During his short tenure, Dixon's major accomplishment was convincing Stephen Douglas to include language in the Kansas-Nebraska Act that explicitly repealed the Missouri Compromise's prohibition on slavery north of latitude 36°30'.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his term}} in office, Combs was {{appointed}} to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals by President Johnson.

In 1984, Combs agreed to represent sixty-six of the state's poor school districts in a lawsuit challenging the state's system of financing public education. The suit, Rose v. Council for Better Education, resulted in <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> Supreme Court declaring the state's entire system of public schools unconstitutional. In response, <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> General Assembly drafted a sweeping education measure known as <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> Education Reform Act in 1991.

5|$|In 1898, <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> General Assembly {{enacted a}} law which created a Board of Election Commissioners, {{appointed}} by the General Assembly, who were responsible for choosing election commissioners in all of Kentucky's counties. The board was empowered to examine election returns and certify the results. The power to decide the outcome of disputed elections remained with the General Assembly under Section 153 of the state constitution. The law was {{commonly referred to as}} the Goebel Election Law, a reference to its sponsor, President Pro Tempore of <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> Senate William Goebel. Because the General Assembly was heavily Democratic and Goebel was considered a likely Democratic aspirant for the governorship in the 1899 election, the law was attacked as blatantly partisan and self-serving. Republicans organized a test case against the law, but <b>the</b> <b>Kentucky</b> Court of Appeals upheld it as constitutional.|$|E
