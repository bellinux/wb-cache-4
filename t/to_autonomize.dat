On January 29, 1988, in a sweeping restructuring intended to reverse three years of disappointing performance, Akers created five new, highly autonomous organizations responsible for all of the company's innovation, design and manufacturing. The moves were intended to greatly decentralize the company, which had been seen as bloated and unable to keep up with competition, and give significantly more responsibility to a younger generation of managers, while significantly reducing the role of the company's Armonk, N.Y., headquarters in the day-to-day operations. Under the plan, thousands of employees had to switch jobs or find themselves working for new managers. Akers' vision was <b>to</b> <b>autonomize</b> each division into [...] "Baby Blues" [...] with the aim of spinning them off from [...] "Big Blue".|$|E
40|$|The New Public Management (NPM) {{principle}} of autonomization is being gradually {{incorporated into the}} MENA countries’ managerial systems of distribution of drinking water. However, though this trend may seem mainstream, the process is not taking place without difficulties. Whereas a combination of global processes, international pressures and national phenomena encourages MENA countries’ Governments to implement the autonomy issue through reforming programmes for the modernization of the water sector, an amalgamation of historical, environmental, cultural and structural-instrumental factors obstructs such attempts. This dialectic actuality is especially notable in the Tunisian casuistry. The present paper concentrates on this Tunisian actuality to describe, analyze and explain the attempts <b>to</b> <b>autonomize</b> the drinking water management in the country. In so doing, it firstly adapts the operative conception of autonomy to the particular reality of Tunisia. Second, it describes the structure and functioning of the strategic subdivision of the water management’s “distribution of the drinking water”. Finally, it clarifies {{the nature and extent}} of the autonomy enjoyed by the Government organizations operating in this area by scrutinizing historical, instrumental, cultural, and environmental explanatory variables. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} motion of a test {{particle}} around the equilibrium points under the setup of the Robe’s circular restricted three-body problem in which the masses of the three bodies vary arbitrarily with time at the same rate. The first primary {{is assumed to be}} a fluid {{in the shape of a}} sphere whose density also varies with time. The nonautonomous equations are derived and transformed <b>to</b> the <b>autonomized</b> form. Two collinear equilibrium points exist, with one positioned at the center of the fluid while the other exists for the mass ratio and density parameter provided the density parameter assumes value greater than one. Further, circular equilibrium points exist and pairs of out-of-plane equilibrium points forming triangles with the centers of the primaries are found. The out-of-plane points depend on the arbitrary constant, of {{the motion of}} the primaries, density ratio, and mass parameter. The linear stability of the equilibrium points is studied and it is seen that the circular and out-of-plane equilibrium points are unstable while the collinear equilibrium points are stable under some conditions. A numerical example regarding out-of-plane points is given in the case of the Earth, Moon, and submarine system. This study may be useful in the investigations of dynamic problem of the “ocean planets” Kepler- 62 e and Kepler- 62 f orbiting the star Kepler- 62...|$|R
40|$|Distributed {{applications}} are exposed as reusable components that are dynamically discovered and integrated {{to create new}} applications. These new applications, {{in the form of}} aggregate services, are vulnerable to failure due to the autonomous and distributed nature of their integrated components. This vulnerability creates the need for adaptability in aggregate services. The need for adaptation is accentuated for complex long-running applications as is found in scientific Grid computing, where distributed computing nodes may participate to solve computation and data-intensive problems. Such applications integrate services for coordinated problem solving in areas such as Bioinformatics. For such applications, when a constituent service fails, the application fails, even though there are other nodes that can substitute for the failed service. This concern is not addressed in the specification of high-level composition languages such as that of the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL). ^ We propose an approach <b>to</b> transparently <b>autonomizing</b> existing BPEL processes in order to make them modifiable at runtime and more resilient to the failures in their execution environment. By transparent introduction of adaptive behavior, adaptation preserves the original business logic of the aggregate service and does not tangle the code for adaptive behavior with that of the aggregate service. ^ The major contributions of this dissertation are: first, we assessed the effectiveness of BPEL language support in developing adaptive mechanisms. As a result, we identified the strengths and limitations of BPEL and came up with strategies to address those limitations. Second, we developed a technique to enhance existing BPEL processes transparently in order to support dynamic adaptation. We proposed a framework which uses transparent shaping and generative programming to make BPEL processes adaptive. Third, we developed a technique to dynamically discover and bind to substitute services. Our technique was evaluated and the result showed that dynamic utilization of components improves the flexibility of adaptive BPEL processes. Fourth, we developed an extensible policy-based technique to specify how to handle exceptional behavior. We developed a generic component that introduces adaptive behavior for multiple BPEL processes. Fifth, we identify ways to apply our work to facilitate adaptability in composite Grid services. ...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 1980 s the role of government has been discussed in the Netherlands and several other Western countries. In the Netherlands this discussion has led to severe changes in the structures and activities of several governmental organizations, particularly since 1985. Deregulation has been introduced, which has meant that, generally speaking, certain laws and rules have become less detailed or totally abolished. Moreover, there has been a tendency to introduce new organizational structures in governmental organizations. These new organizational structures could mean that certain tasks are relinquished, or that the way of organizing activities is changed. A general characteristic of these changes in organizational structures, which can take different forms and/or differ in specific details, is that governmental organizations are now governed in a less centralized way. The general concept of autonomization will be used in this paper to denote the different forms of decentralization. In general, autonomization of public organizations means that the political top management’s direct control of certain tasks or activities will be diminished. External autonomization implies that, legally speaking, an independent organization comes into existence; and the politicians’ responsibilities for the organization are diminished. In the case of internal autonomization the organization remains part of its parent organization, although it gains more freedom to conduct its own business. The political top management retains formal responsibility for the activities of the internally autonomized organization. Internal autonomization includes various forms of what is traditionally termed decentralization or divisionalization. Forms of external autonomization include, for example, privatization, contractorization (contracting-out) and the founding of a public corporation. So, autonomization comprises diverging forms of decentralization and internal and external contracting, of which privatization may be seen as the most extreme opposite of centralized governance. Generally speaking, a stronger form of autonomization means that the organization is subject to more direct influences of the market and/or is governed in a more “businesslike” way; i. e. {{in such a way that}} the principles and techniques of business administration play a more important role. This may also make the relationship with (what used to be) the parent organization more businesslike, inducing clearer agreements about prices, quantities and quality of goods and services. The introduction of these new organizational structures/forms can be considered an endeavour to maintain management control over governmental organizations. Management control is the whole range of means and activities through which political and civic managers try to ensure that an organization successfully adapts to changes in its environment, so that its continuity is safeguarded. This research project focuses on two elements, in particular, that may play an important role in management control (and that also might influence each other); i. e. changes in organizational structure (that is to say: the different forms of autonomization) and changes in the financial and economic management of the autonomized organization. Autonomization could be regarded as a change in governance structures or, more broadly, as a change in institutional structures or institutions. Generally speaking, neo-institutional economic theories see a striving for efficiency - or in stronger terms: the necessity for organizations to be efficient in order to survive - as the main reason for changes in organizational structure. The three following research questions were formulated: 1. 	is it possible to construct a theoretical concept, based on neo-institutional economics, to explain the management control and more specifically the autonomization of (parts of) governmental organizations?; 2. 	in the Dutch context what elements play a role in the choice of a particular form of management control and autonomization of governmental organizations?; 3. 	what changes occur in financial and economic management practices when governmental organizations are autonomized? These questions could be studied from, for example, the perspective of political science, sociology, or economics, or a combination of all these perspectives. Although non-economic aspects might also play an important role, the research problem is studied mainly from an economic point of view in this book. The main aim of this study is to gain an insight into the internal organizational processes and the effects of the autonomization of governmental organizations. The problem to be addressed is very complicated because the factors that may play a role are not at all clear. The phenomenon researched and its context cannot be separated clearly, causes and consequences cannot be separated easily, etc. Hence, the form of research that was chosen was case research. Case research was conducted for this study in six (parts of) governmental organizations which were <b>autonomized</b> <b>to</b> different degrees. In one case, autonomization had not been realized at the time of the research, because of serious delays. However, the information about the process of preparing for autonomization was sufficiently extensive and interesting in this case to justify its inclusion. ...|$|R
40|$|According to Julia Kristeva, abjection is an {{unconscious}} process (a cut) {{every human being}} has to operate to be able <b>to</b> <b>autonomize</b> her or himself from the dyadic relationship with the mother. An autonomous subject then has access to what « sémiotique tensive » (influenced by the phenomenology of perception andstructuralism) calls « field of presence » from where she or he can enunciate and thus enter the Symbolic order. In this thesis, I posit that the field of presence changes from modernity to postmodernity, and that some avant-garde authors, such as Michel Butor in the 1960 's, are articulating the shift {{from one to the}} other and modifying the relationship between subject and abject. My textual analyses focus on two of Butor's most innovative books : Mobile. Étude pour une représentation des États-Unis (published in 1962) and 6 810 000 litres d'eau par seconde. Étude stéréophonique (usually referred to by critics as Niagara, the title of its English translation, published in 1965). My hypothesis is that, on the level of enunciation, Mobile shows traces of a modem field of presence, where the margins are highly dysphoric (abject), while Niagara tends to represent a more postmodern one, using différent discursive stratégies to defuse the abject threat. I close with a reflection on the state of abjection as a subjectivity inducing process, the subject it exhausts in postmodern times, and the new relationship to the body (therefore, to perception and enunciation) it imposes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFor a {{long time}} (and in some way {{it is still the}} case) the {{scholastic}} tradition considered languagechange as an ungraceful deformation of the existing patterns. Indeed, change represented the dangerof compromising the social order established by the standard norm; that is what Manessy (1989) expressed by the term of "subversion" in one of his articles about French in Africa. In another way,contact and interference phenomena still imply ‘subversion’ in Weinreich’s point of view, as far asbilingual proficiency is the ability to keep the two languages apart (Weinreich 1953 : 3). The underlying assumption is the structuralist dogma that human languages are stable sets ofunits and combination rules. Contact involves subversion {{in the sense that the}} encounter with analien system leaves traces in the language under consideration. Essentially, the problem is to provewhat seems to be an evident observation: as languages do not exist by themselves, they cannot be incontact. Only speakers and speech communities are effectively in contact, by interacting in concretesituations. If the so-called ‘language contact’ takes place in interactions, it would be impossible toobserve language contact directly, and the concept could even less explain directly what is going on. The aim of our contribution is to render the assumption explicit that change is an ongoingprocess constitutive of human language to which we will refer by the term of dynamics. We willdiscuss how the general tendency of grammatical ‘systems’ <b>to</b> <b>autonomize</b> by promoting their own,‘self-contained’ (Croft 1995) logic is counter-balanced through the subversion that occurs ineveryday’s elaboration of discourse. We will work out how mere interaction conditions thelanguage dynamics and how the disposable structural resources will be coordinated in microsystemsthat can be traced back to different typological sources. Our purpose will be illustrated by anexample from the contact between French and Manding languages in Ivory Coast...|$|E
