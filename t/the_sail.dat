5|$|Dimetrodon was {{probably}} one of the apex predators of the Cisuralian ecosystems, feeding on fish and tetrapods, including reptiles and amphibians. Smaller Dimetrodon species may have had different ecological roles. <b>The</b> <b>sail</b> of Dimetrodon may have been used to stabilize its spine or to heat and cool its body as a form of thermoregulation. Some recent studies argue that <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> would have been ineffective at removing heat from the body, and was most likely used in courtship display.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists have {{proposed}} {{many ways in}} which <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> could have functioned in life. Some of the first to think about its purpose suggested that <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> may have served as camouflage among reeds while Dimetrodon waited for prey, or as an actual boat-like sail to catch the wind while the animal was in the water. Another is that the long neural spines could have stabilized the trunk by restricting up-and-down movement, which would allow for a more efficient side-to-side movement while walking.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} has two objectives. First, it aims at finding out {{the influence of}} <b>the</b> <b>sailing</b> period toward <b>the</b> pedagogic competence of the lecturers in Seamanship Polytechnic Makassar. Second, it aims at finding out the influence of <b>the</b> difference of <b>sailing</b> period toward <b>the</b> professionalism competence of lecturers in Seamanship Polytechnic Makassar. This research was ex-post facto because lecturers in Seamanship Polytechnic Makassar, who were the subjects of this research, have individual characteristics which relate to <b>the</b> experience of <b>sailing</b> time of {{less than five years}}, between five years up to ten years and over 10 years. One-way analysis of variance results shows that <b>the</b> <b>sailing</b> period has a significant influence on the probability of 0. 00 on pedagogical competence. <b>The</b> <b>sailing</b> period that is less than five years is 3. 32. <b>The</b> <b>sailing</b> period that is between 5 years up to 10 years is 4, 09. <b>The</b> <b>sailing</b> period that is over ten years is 4, 21. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>sailing</b> period has an influence on the professionalism competence with the probability value is 0. 00. <b>The</b> <b>sailing</b> period that is less than five years is 4, 25. <b>The</b> <b>sailing</b> period that is between 5 years up to 10 years is 3, 91. <b>The</b> <b>sailing</b> period that is over ten years is 3, 24. It means that <b>the</b> <b>sailing</b> period affects <b>the</b> competence of pedagogic and professionalism of the lecturers. Furthermore, One-way analysis of variance results show that the influence of <b>the</b> <b>sailing</b> period toward <b>the</b> pedagogic competence is getting bigger along with increasing period of sailing. However, it is the opposite of the professionalism competence. Key word : Sailing period, pedagogic competence, profesioanalism comptenc...|$|R
5|$|Wind shear affects sailboats {{in motion}} by {{presenting}} a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the mast. The effect of low level wind shear can be factored into {{the selection of}} sail twist in <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> design, but this {{can be difficult to}} predict since wind shear may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> to account for low level wind shear, for example using a boom vang.|$|E
5|$|Finally, it {{is quite}} {{possible}} that <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> or hump combined these functions, acting normally as a heat regulator, becoming a courting aid during the mating season, being used to cool itself and, on occasions, turning into an intimidating device when an animal was feeling threatened.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, J.Scott Turner and C.Richard Tracy {{proposed}} that {{the evolution of a}} sail in Dimetrodon was related to the evolution of warm-bloodedness in mammal ancestors. They thought that <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> of Dimetrodon enabled it to be homeothermic, maintaining a constant, albeit low, body temperature. Mammals are also homeothermic, although they differ from Dimetrodon in being endothermic, controlling their body temperature internally through heightened metabolism. Turner and Tracy noted that early therapsids, a more advanced group of synapsids closely related to mammals, had long limbs which can release heat {{in a manner similar to}} that of <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> of Dimetrodon. The homeothermy that developed in animals like Dimetrodon may have carried over to therapsids through a modification of body shape, which would eventually develop into the warm-bloodedness of mammals.|$|E

5|$|Most {{of these}} studies give two thermoregulatory roles for <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> of Dimetrodon: one {{as a means of}} warming quickly in the morning, and another as a way to cool down when body {{temperature}} becomes high. Dimetrodon and all other Early Permian land vertebrates are assumed to have been cold-blooded or poikilothermic, relying on the sun to maintain a high body temperature. Because of its large size, Dimetrodon had high thermal inertia, meaning that changes in body temperature occurred more slowly in it than in smaller-bodied animals. As temperatures rose in the mornings, the small-bodied prey of Dimetrodon could warm their bodies much faster than could something the size of Dimetrodon. Many paleontologists including Haack have proposed that <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> of Dimetrodon may have allowed it to warm quickly in the morning in order to keep pace with its prey. The sail's large surface area also meant heat could dissipate quickly into the surroundings, useful if the animal needed to release excess heat produced by metabolism or absorbed from the sun. Dimetrodon may have angled its sail away from the sun to cool off or restricted blood flow to <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> to maintain heat at night.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies on}} <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> of Dimetrodon and other sphenacodontids support Haack's 1986 {{contention}} that <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> was poorly adapted to releasing heat {{and maintaining a}} stable body temperature. The presence of sails in small-bodied species of Dimetrodon such as D.milleri and D.teutonis does not fit {{the idea that the}} sail's purpose was thermoregulation because smaller sails are less able to transfer heat and because small bodies can absorb and release heat easily on their own. Moreover, close relatives of Dimetrodon such as Sphenacodon have very low crests that would have been useless as thermoregulatory devices. The large sail of Dimetrodon is thought to have developed gradually from these smaller crests, meaning that over most of the sail's evolutionary history, thermoregulation could not have served an important function.|$|E
5|$|The large groove {{that runs}} {{the length of the}} spine was once thought to be a channel for blood vessels, but since the bone does not contain {{vascular}} canals, <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> is not thought to have been as highly vascularized as once thought. Some specimens of Dimetrodon preserve deformed areas of the neural spines that appear to be healed-over fractures. The cortical bone that grew over these breaks is highly vascularized, suggesting that soft tissue must have been present on <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> to supply the site with blood vessels. Layered lamellar bone makes up most of the neural spine's cross-sectional area, and contains lines of arrested growth {{that can be used to}} determine the age of each individual at death. In many specimens of D. gigashomogenes the distal portions of spines bend sharply, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> would have had an irregular profile in life. Their crookedness suggests that soft tissue may not have extended all the way to the tips of the spines, meaning that the sail's webbing may not have been as extensive as it is commonly imagined.|$|E

5|$|Larger bodied {{specimens}} of Dimetrodon have larger sails {{relative to their}} size, an example of positive allometry. Positive allometry may benefit thermoregulation because it means that, as individuals get larger, surface area increases faster than mass. Larger-bodied animals generate {{a great deal of}} heat through metabolism, and the amount of heat that must be dissipated from the body surface is significantly greater than what must be dissipated by smaller-bodied animals. Effective heat dissipation can be predicted across many different animals with a single relationship between mass and surface area. However, a 2010 study of allometry in Dimetrodon found a different relationship between its sail and body mass: the actual scaling exponent of <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> was much larger than the exponent expected in an animal adapted to heat dissipation. The researchers concluded that <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> of Dimetrodon grew at a much faster rate than was necessary for thermoregulation, and suggested that sexual selection was the primary reason for its evolution.|$|E
5|$|As {{pointed out}} by Jack Bailey (1997), the spines resembled those of sail-bearing pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon. According to Bailey, Amargasaurus might also have possessed such a sail, {{which might have been}} used for display. Unlike those of pelycosaurs, the neural spines of Amargasaurus were bifurcated, forming a double row along the neck and back. As the space between both rows was merely , the {{existence}} of two parallel sails seems unlikely. Instead, Bailey suggested the spines represented a scaffold which was completely enveloped by a single skin. Paul argued against <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> hypothesis, noting that neck sails would have reduced neck flexion, and that the spines were circular in cross-section rather than flattened {{as is the case in}} sail-bearing animals.|$|E

5|$|Midshipman David Casey was an {{experienced}} junior {{officer who had}} distinguished himself to Captain Pigot during the previous months, but his disrating {{was one of the}} primary triggers to the mutiny. About a week before the mutiny, Casey was at his station on the main top, and the captain noticed that a gasket, one of the ties that held <b>the</b> <b>sail</b> securely, had not been tied by one of the sailors under his supervision. Casey was brought before the captain, and apologised for the oversight and took responsibility for it. The captain demanded that Casey apologise on his knees, a completely unacceptable and debasing demand for a gentleman. Casey refused to be humiliated in such a way. Pigot offered him one more opportunity and when Casey once more refused, the captain ordered that Casey receive 12 lashes (more commonly a sailor's punishment than that of a junior officer), and he was disrated, which would effectively end his career as a naval officer. Casey was a popular officer amongst the crew and they felt that he was punished unfairly. The topmen began to plot mutiny.|$|E

5|$|The {{strategies}} that sailfish and thresher sharks employ against shoaling fish {{are more effective}} when the shoal is first concentrated into a ‘bait ball’ (Helfman, Collette & Facey, 1997; Oliver et al., 2013; Domenici et al., 2014). Since this is difficult for individual predators to achieve, they cooperate in this effort. When herding a shoal of fish or squid, sailfish also raise their sails to make themselves appear larger. When they slash or wipe their bills through shoaling fish by turning their heads, their dorsal sail and fins are outstretched to stabilize their bodies hydrodynamically (Lauder & Drucker, 2004). Domenici et al. (2014) postulate that these fin extensions enhance the accuracy of tapping and slashing. <b>The</b> <b>sail</b> can reduce yaw rotation by counteracting the lateral force in the direction opposite to the slash. This means that prey {{is less likely to}} recognize the massive trunk as being part of an approaching predator (Marras et al., 2015; Webb & Weihs 2015). Film footage available online impressively demonstrates the hunting strategies of sailfish and thresher sharks.|$|E
