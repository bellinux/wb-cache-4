5|$|Charles Marowitz created A Macbeth in 1969, a {{streamlined}} {{version of}} the play which requires only eleven actors. The production strongly suggests <b>that</b> <b>Lady</b> Macbeth is in league with the witches. One scene shows her leading the three to a firelight incantation. In Eugène Ionesco's satirical {{version of the}} play Macbett (1972), one of the witches removes a costume to reveal that she is, in fact, Lady Duncan, and wants to be Macbeth's mistress. Once Macbeth is King and they are married, however, she abandons him, revealing {{that she was not}} Lady Duncan all along, but a witch. The real Lady Duncan appears and denounces Macbeth as a traitor.|$|E

5|$|In April 1953, at the {{invitation}} of the French government, she traveled to the Cannes Film Festival, where she met Pierre Galante, an executive editor for the French journal Paris Match. Following a long-distance courtship and the requisite nine-month residency requirement, deHavilland and Galante married on April 12, 1955, in the village of Yvoy-le-Marron, and settled together in a three-story house near the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris' 16th arrondissement. That same year, she returned to the screen in Terence Young's period drama <b>That</b> <b>Lady</b> (1955), about a Spanish princess and her unrequited love for King Philip II of Spain, whose respect she earned in her youth after losing an eye in a sword fight defending his honor. According to Tony Thomas, the film uses authentic Spanish locations effectively, but suffers from a convoluted plot and excessive dialogue, and while deHavilland delivered a warm and elegant performance as Ana de Mendoza, the film was disappointing. Following her appearances in the romantic melodrama Not as a Stranger (1955) and The Ambassador's Daughter (1956)neither of which were successful at the box officedeHavilland gave birth to her second child, Gisèle Galante, on July 18, 1956.|$|E
