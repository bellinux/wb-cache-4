5|$|The two {{subspecies}} {{are similar}} in coloration, but differ in <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> of the cap. The northern subspecies, living in Central Pacific Costa Rica, has a lighter cap than the southern subspecies, which lives in Panama and in parts of Costa Rica near Panama. The southern subspecies also has more yellowish limbs and underparts.|$|E
5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E
30|$|These {{results show}} that <b>the</b> <b>shading</b> factor has no {{influence}} on <b>the</b> time of <b>shading</b> as <b>the</b> path of the obstacle across the modules is fixed. <b>The</b> <b>shading</b> factor however works with static <b>shading</b> to change <b>the</b> movement of the GMPP and reduces the overall power available as <b>the</b> <b>shading</b> factor increases. As <b>the</b> <b>shading</b> strength increases, <b>the</b> <b>shading</b> becomes more severe leading to {{a greater number of}} transitions between adjacent MPP locations.|$|R
40|$|Progress {{and issues}} of the study on <b>the</b> <b>shading</b> {{perception}} are reviewed. <b>Shading</b> is <b>the</b> gradual change of the luminous intensity which is often generated on an object when the light souce (e. g. the Sun) illuminates it. Our visual system is able in recover three dimensional world by using <b>the</b> <b>shading</b> information as a depth cue. It has been considered that <b>the</b> <b>shading</b> information is processed in the higher-order visual process. However, recent studics suggest that the information can be also extracted in the lower-order visual process and these proposals are supported by some neurophysiological evidences. This review is organized as follows: (1) two constraints in <b>the</b> <b>shading</b> perception, (2) <b>the</b> research method to investigate <b>the</b> <b>shading</b> perception. (3) <b>the</b> processing of <b>the</b> <b>shading</b> information in <b>the</b> higher and lower-order vision.

5|$|However, in 2000, the Patriots {{also became}} one of the only teams to drop the rounded numbers and {{switched}} back to block numbers. Also that year, <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> of blue was darkened from royal to nautical blue. The Patriots, unsatisfied with the white-on-silver road look, also took the opportunity to introduce blue pants to be worn with the white jersey, offering a better contrast. To better match the blue pants, the number on the white jersey was switched from red to blue.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting {{his players}} {{to be more}} {{distinctly}} dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> to a brighter pillar box red. Two possibilities have been suggested for {{the origin of the}} white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to single-player, the title features cooperative multiplayer, where players can accept invitation from {{up to six}} other players to join their game session through either LAN or online connection. Alongside being able to fight enemies together, players can swap messages and exchange loot. There is also a Level Editor available, where players can access developer tools and create their own levels which can be shared with other players. The editor features {{a large amount of}} options for environment customization, including adjusting <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> of environmental elements like roads.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>shading</b> factor {{analysis}} provides the energy loss from photovoltaic panels due to near shading. Near shading means partial shading that affects {{a part of}} the panel(s) [7]. <b>The</b> <b>shaded</b> part changes during the day and also over a season. <b>The</b> <b>shading</b> factor is a ratio between the energy generated from the illuminated part and the total area of the field, or inversely, the energy loss [7].|$|R
30|$|Vicinity shadings and <b>the</b> <b>shading</b> {{caused by}} <b>the</b> wires {{crossing}} the PV field {{give rise to}} different effects. Vicinity shadings have {{a direct impact on}} the string current, while <b>the</b> <b>shading</b> caused by <b>the</b> overhead wires does not lead to a significant reduction in the photo-generated current. Moreover, nearby shadings occur only in the winter months, while <b>the</b> <b>shading</b> caused by <b>the</b> overhead wires occurs all over the year.|$|R
30|$|The tests results {{reveal a}} small {{reduction}} of MPP for <b>the</b> <b>shaded</b> module {{compared with the}} MPP of PV module without <b>shading,</b> for <b>the</b> same temperature and under uniform irradiation.

In addition, the results of energy tests did not reveal a significant reduction of generated energy, within the same observation period, of <b>the</b> <b>shaded</b> PV modules compared with <b>the</b> ones without <b>shading.</b>|$|R
5|$|The National Cockade Act of 1831 did {{not specify}} <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> of red, {{for which it was}} criticized by Joachim Lelewel, nor did the Coat of Arms and National Colors Act of 1919.

5|$|The {{decision}} {{to bring in}} and then kill a Shade {{at the end of}} the book was made when Paolini realized he needed a new ending for the book after it was split up. He was in need of plot points that were strong enough to keep the reader interested through the ending of the book. The point of view of Glaedr and Oromis' confrontation with Thorn and Murtagh was combined with <b>the</b> <b>Shade</b> battle to further keep the reader interested.|$|E
5|$|The {{designs of}} most of these flags have been {{modified}} only {{to adjust to the}} changes in the official rendering of the national coat of arms. Major modifications included a change in the stylization of the eagle from Neoclassicist to Baroque in 1927 and the removal of the crown from the eagle's head during the Communist rule from 1944 to 1990. Legal specification for the shades of the national colors has also changed with time. <b>The</b> <b>shade</b> of red was first legally specified as vermilion by a presidential decree of 13 December 1928.|$|E

5|$|There is {{very little}} {{geographic}} variation in size. The main differences are {{the presence or absence}} of a whitish partial collar at the base of the nape, the variations in <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> of the nape and the tone of the underparts. Populations in central Asia have slightly larger wings and western populations have a slightly heavier bill. Body colour becomes darker further north, in mountain regions and humid climates, and paler elsewhere. However, individual variation, particularly in juveniles and also during the months before moulting, can often be greater than geographic differences.|$|E
5|$|This {{species may}} be active {{during the day}} and at night. However, on bright, sunny days, they are usually found coiled or {{stretched}} out somewhere in <b>the</b> <b>shade.</b> In the morning and on cool days, they can often be seen basking in the sunlight. They often emerge at sunset to warm themselves on warm ground (i.e., sidewalks, roads) and then become very active throughout the night, when they are usually found swimming or crawling. Contrary to popular belief, they are capable of biting while under water.|$|E
5|$|Being cold-blooded, frogs have {{to adopt}} {{suitable}} behaviour patterns to regulate their temperature. To warm up, {{they can move}} into the sun or onto a warm surface; if they overheat, they can move into <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> or adopt a stance that exposes the minimum area of skin to the air. This posture {{is also used to}} prevent water loss and involves the frog squatting close to the substrate with its hands and feet tucked under its chin and body. The colour of a frog's skin is used for thermoregulation. In cool damp conditions, the colour will be darker than on a hot dry day. The grey foam-nest tree frog (Chiromantis xerampelina) is even able to turn white to minimize the chance of overheating.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} Afrikaners {{are a small}} group (10%) within the white {{minority}} group, Afrikaner recipes are popular. Biltong, a type of jerky, is a popular snack, prepared by hanging bits of spiced raw meat to dry in <b>the</b> <b>shade.</b> Boerewors is served with sadza. It is a long sausage, often well-spiced, composed of beef rather than pork, and barbecued. As Zimbabwe was a British colony, some people there have adopted some colonial-era English eating habits. For example, most people will have porridge in the morning, as well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked sadza, or sandwiches (which {{is more common in}} the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner.|$|E

However, <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> was not seen as a distinct colour until the 20th century; before then, according to Vanderwyk, such dogs can be traced but were not registered. A degree of crossbreeding with Flatcoat or Chesapeake Bay retrievers was also documented in the early 20th century, prior to recognition. Chocolate Labradors were also well established in the early 20th century at the kennels of the Earl of Feversham, and Lady Ward of Chiltonfoliat.|$|E
5|$|Péron's {{interview}} describes {{some aspects}} of the behaviour of the King Island emu. He writes that the bird was generally solitary but gathered in flocks of ten to twenty at breeding time, then wandered off in pairs. They ate berries, grass and seaweed, and foraged mainly during morning and evening. They were swift runners, but were apparently slower than the mainland birds, due to being fat. They swam well, but only did so when necessary. They reportedly liked <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> of lagoons and the shoreline, rather than open areas. They used a claw on each wing for scratching themselves. If unable to flee from the hunting dogs of the sealers, they would defend themselves by kicking, which could inflict a great deal of harm.|$|E
5|$|Storage can be {{short-term}} or long-term. Most {{vegetables are}} perishable and short-term storage {{for a few}} days provides flexibility in marketing. During storage, leafy vegetables lose moisture, and the vitamin C in them degrades rapidly. A few products such as potatoes and onions have better keeping qualities and can be sold when higher prices may be available, and by extending the marketing season, a greater total volume of crop can be sold. If refrigerated storage is not available, the priority for most crops is to store high-quality produce, to maintain a high humidity level, and to keep the produce in <b>the</b> <b>shade.</b>|$|E
