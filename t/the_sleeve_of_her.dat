5|$|The woman's {{hands are}} crossed tightly {{as if in}} prayer, and {{positioned}} so low in the painting as {{to appear to be}} resting on the frame. They are rendered as tightly compressed into a small area of the picture; it is likely van der Weyden did not want them to result in an area of high tone that might distract from the description of her head. Her slender fingers are minutely detailed; van der Weyden often indicated the social position of his models through his rendering of their face and hands. <b>The</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress extends beyond her wrists. Her fingers are folded in layers; their intricate portrayal is the most detailed element in the painting, and echoes the pyramidal form of the upper portion of the painting.|$|E
500|$|In {{the centre}} poses Tomimoto Toyohina, a famed geisha of the Tamamuraya {{house in the}} Yoshiwara {{pleasure}} district. [...] She was dubbed [...] "Tomimoto" [...] having made her name playing Tomimoto-bushi music on the shamisen. [...] Like the other two models, she has her hair up in the fashionable Shimada style that was popular at the time. [...] Contrasted with the homelier teahouse-girl garments {{of the other two}} models, she is dressed in the showier geisha style. [...] The Tomimoto crest's Japanese primrose design adorns <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> kimono. [...] Toyohina's birthdate is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|The {{woman in}} Mare ni Au Koi ( [...] , [...] "love that rarely meets") appears quite young and sheltered; she is {{probably}} in her teens. [...] She wears an ornate kushi-kanzashi comb-shaped hairpin and bashfully sticks her fingers just barely from <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> kimono. [...] The title refers {{not to a}} woman who rarely meets her lover, but to a shy young woman inexperienced in love, and her expression is the most withdrawn in the series.|$|E
60|$|The lady smiled wearily at the proposal, {{and raised}} her hands in protest, the lace on <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{dressing}} gown falling away from her white arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "What I like {{is a nice}} prim little woman, {{who never}} had a pin {{in the wrong place}} in her life. Her cuffs and collars are always as stiff as steel, and she never rubs <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dresses by leaning about, like some young ladies." ...|$|R
60|$|The Story Girl was barefooted and barearmed, having rolled <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pink gingham {{up to her}} shoulders. Around {{her waist}} was twisted a girdle of the blood-red roses that bloomed in Aunt Olivia's garden; on her sleek curls she wore a chaplet <b>of</b> them; and <b>her</b> hands were full of them.|$|R
2500|$|In 1864, she was {{appointed}} by Union General Benjamin Butler as the [...] "lady in charge" [...] of the hospitals {{at the front of}} the Army of the James. Among her more harrowing experiences was an incident in which a bullet tore through <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress without striking her and killed a man to whom she was tending. She was known as the [...] "American Nightingale." [...] She was also known as the [...] "Angel of the Battlefield" [...] after she came to the aid of the overwhelmed surgeon on duty following the battle of Cedar Mountain in Northern Virginia in August 1862. [...] She arrived at a field hospital at midnight with a large amount of supplies to help the severely wounded soldiers. This naming came from her frequent timely assistance as she served troops at the battles of Fairfax Station, Chantilly, Harpers Ferry, South Mountain, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Charleston, Petersburg and Cold Harbor.|$|E
6000|$|And a girl saw, {{and as she}} saw {{her heart}} leaped to her mouth. Her small hand gripped <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father's coat. [...] "The king, father," [...] she cried. [...] "It is the king." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{caught herself}} speculating as she plucked at <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> black {{mourning}} waist: [...] "I wonder would I be more interesting if I had the orange-and-brown dress I {{was going to}} make when mother died?... Oh, shame!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Thousand Blade (or One Thousand Fingers) {{the only}} female King uses her {{sexuality}} to lull her targets into lowering their guard before killing them with the many knives concealed in <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> robe. After failing to seduce One-Arm, she is fatally stabbed {{by one of the}} students she seduced and wounded.|$|R
60|$|Through <b>the</b> open-worked <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{dress she}} could feel the sun bite vigorously.|$|R
60|$|She {{sat down}} beside him with a laugh and a pretty blush. She was in <b>her</b> apron, and <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress were rolled to her elbows, {{displaying}} the strong, round arms. Wholesome and sweet she looked and smelled, {{the scent of the}} cooking round her. Lyman munched a couple of the cookies and gulped a pint of milk before he spoke.|$|R
6000|$|He {{could not}} {{visualize}} her. He could see <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> blue corduroy jacket; her eyes {{he could not}} see. She was a stranger. Had he idealized her? He was apologetic for his unflattering doubt, but of what sort was she? ...|$|E
6000|$|Katherine {{might have}} faintly blushed; but the slight smile, which {{mingled with the}} {{expression}} of her shame, gave to her countenance a look of additional archness, and she laid her hand lightly on <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> guardian, to detain him, as she replied: ...|$|E
60|$|Catching her {{suddenly}} {{round the}} waist he thrust {{her into a}} cottage armchair which stood by, and, despite her struggles, began to cut at <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress with the lancet in his hand. But soon he realised that the task was hopeless.|$|E
60|$|She {{pulled up}} <b>the</b> loose <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> blouse, {{and he saw}} the bruised {{imprints}} of two fingers.|$|R
6000|$|... "So, thou's off," [...] said Mrs. Sturt, {{coming in}} from the back regions <b>of</b> <b>her</b> territory, with <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> gown tucked up, enveloped in a large {{roundabout}} apron which covered almost all her dress. Mrs. Sturt would no more have thought <b>of</b> doing <b>her</b> work in the front kitchen than I should think of doing mine in the drawing-room. [...] "So thou's off home again, my lass," [...] said Mrs. Sturt.|$|R
50|$|Streisand chose Century Italic {{typeface}} for <b>the</b> album <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> debut album, {{which would}} also be used on 19 other Streisand album covers.|$|R
6000|$|After {{the retreat}} of the French, [...] "a pension was settled upon Augustina, {{and the daily}} pay of an artilleryman. She was also to wear a small shield of honour, {{embroidered}} upon <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> gown, with 'Zaragoza' inscribed upon it" [...] (Southey's Peninsular War, ii. 14, 34).|$|E
6000|$|Suddenly with a nimble {{hand she}} had unbuttoned and rolled up <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> blouse. She stuck her pretty blue-veined arm before his eyes. [...] "Look here, sir, it was you, wasn't it? It was your {{powerful}} jaw inflicted this bite upon {{the arm of}} a defenceless young leopardess--" ...|$|E
6000|$|She colored {{so quickly}} that he knew {{she must have been}} {{conscious}} at the time, and he noticed now that <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cloak, which had been half torn off her bare arm, was pinned together over it. When and how had she managed to do it without his detecting the act? ...|$|E
60|$|Wyllard was {{somewhat}} astonished at this announcement. For one thing, {{he was more}} or less acquainted with the state of his friend's finances. During the next moment or two he glanced meditatively through the open door into the adjoining room, where Sally Creighton was busy beside <b>the</b> stove. <b>The</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> light bodice were rolled up well above the elbow, and she had pretty, round arms, which were just then partly immersed in dough.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose she}} does care about him," [...] said Mrs. Cornbury, sitting in Mrs. Sturt's little parlour that opened out upon the kitchen garden. Mrs. Sturt was also seated, {{leaning on the}} corner of the table, with <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> gown tucked up, ready for work when the Squire's lady should be gone, but very willing to {{postpone}} her work as long as the Squire's lady would stay and gossip with her.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{painting}} "Pride of the Ghetto" by Nathaldi Siehel, depicting a young gypsy woman against a wall, [s. d. ]. The young girl stands at center, her hands clasped in front <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> holding up a bunch <b>of</b> slack from <b>her</b> skirt. <b>The</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lightly-colored blouse billow down around her elbows. Her hair is dark and thick, her large, almond-shaped eyes peering out directly at the viewer from under the bangs. Hoop earrings can be seen dangling from her ears...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't {{go for a}} moment," [...] Tom cried, desperately detaining his {{companion}} by <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> jacket. [...] "We are alone here and can talk. Don't you think--don't {{you think you could}} like me a little bit if you were to try? I love you so, Kate, that I cannot help hoping that my love is not all lost." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{sweep of}} his long arm, so swift Ellen {{had no time to}} move, brought his hand in {{clutching}} contact with her. And the force of it flung her half across the cabin room, leaving <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> blouse in his grasp. Pantingly she put out that bared arm and her other to ward him off as he took long, slow strides toward her.|$|E
6000|$|... "That were {{to expose}} thee to {{the gaze of}} those dogs of Ishmael and of Edom," [...] whispered Isaac, with a {{suspicious}} glance towards the crowd of knights and squires. But Rebecca was already busied in carrying her charitable purpose into effect, and listed not what he said, until Isaac, seizing <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mantle, again exclaimed, in a hurried voice--"Beard of Aaron!--what if the youth perish!--if he die in our custody, shall we not be held guilty of his blood, and be torn to pieces by the multitude?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Our host rushed at {{his sister}} and grabbed the white wrist that escaped from <b>the</b> loose <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress. [...] "What was in that note?" [...] he quite hissed at her.|$|R
60|$|She {{held out}} her hands to him, and <b>the</b> broad <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dressing-gown fell away from her white rounded arms. Her eyes were wonderfully soft, the pink upon her cheeks was the blush of a girl.|$|R
60|$|She wore a dirty apron, and <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{cotton dress}} were turned up above her elbows; she had curling pins in her hair. Mrs. Athelny {{was a large}} woman, a good three inches taller than her husband, fair, with blue eyes and a kindly expression; {{she had been a}} {{handsome}} creature, but advancing years and the bearing of many children had made her fat and blousy; her blue eyes had become pale, her skin was coarse and red, the colour had gone out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair. She straightened herself, wiped her hand on her apron, and held it out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{would take}} such a heart as that? It would not be worth the giving or worth the taking. Oh--how I loved him!" [...] Then he left her side, {{and went back to}} the window, while she sank back upon her chair, and, burying her face in her hands, gave way to tears and sobs. He stood there perhaps for a minute, and then {{returning}} to her, so gently that she did not hear him, he did kneel at her side. He knelt, and putting his hand upon her arm, he kissed <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> gown. [...] "You had better go from me now," [...] she said, amidst her sobs.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let us toss for it, lass!' Sarah {{showed no}} indignation {{whatever}} at the proposition; her mother's eternal suggestion had schooled {{her to the}} acceptance of something of the kind, and her weak nature {{made it easy to}} her to grasp at any way out of the difficulty. She stood with downcast eyes idly picking at <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress, seeming to have tacitly acquiesced in the proposal. Both men instinctively realising this pulled each a coin from his pocket, spun it in the air, and dropped his other hand over the palm on which it lay. For a few seconds they remained thus, all silent; then Abel, who was the more thoughtful of the men, spoke: ...|$|E
60|$|Miss Mordaunt {{was kind}} enough to comply literally, both curtsying and smiling {{precisely}} as she had been desired to do, though I could see she was also slightly disposed to laugh. I was still making my bow, and mumbling some unintelligible compliment, when Katrinke gave a little exclamation, and using the freedom of an old and confidential servant, she eagerly pulled <b>the</b> <b>sleeve</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> young mistress, and hurriedly whispered something in her ear. Anneke coloured, turned quickly towards me, bent her eyes more boldly and steadily on my face--and then it was that I fancied the sweetest smile which mortal had ever received, or that with which I had just before been received, was much surpassed.|$|E
60|$|The woods echoed it; {{there was}} an {{interval}} of silence, and then a faint response. But it was HER voice. He ran eagerly forward in that direction, and called again; the response was nearer this time, and then the tall ferns parted, and her lithe, graceful figure came running, stumbling, and limping towards him like a wounded fawn. Her face was pale and agitated, the tendrils <b>of</b> <b>her</b> light hair were straying over her shoulder, and one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> school-gown was stained with blood and dust. He caught the white and trembling hands that were thrust out to him eagerly.|$|R
5000|$|... wears a {{gown with}} wide, open sleeves lined in light pink. Her high waist is accentuated with a knotted sash. <b>The</b> full <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> chemise are {{gathered}} into ornamented bands, and {{she wears a}} broad hat that matches her gown, 1518.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{painting}} depicting the "The Shepherdess", Henri Le Rolle showing a shepherdess with a flock of sheep, ca. 1900. A women stands at the right with a long, dark skirt and corset and <b>the</b> <b>sleeves</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lightly-colored shirt rolled up to her shoulders. Her hair is tied in a bun and she can be seen leaning a stick with a cloth draped over it on her right shoulder. One sheep follows her on the right while the rest are grouped behind her. Many trees stand in a sporadic line {{on the left and}} another women can be seen working behind them...|$|R
