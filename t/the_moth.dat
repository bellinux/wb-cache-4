5|$|Dru Drury, who {{described}} <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> in 1773, {{placed it in}} the genus Papilio, considering it a butterfly. Jacob Hübner placed it in <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> genus Chrysiridia in 1823. Later redescriptions led to junior synonyms such as Chrysiridia madagascariensis (Lesson, 1831).|$|E
5|$|P. exclamans {{take several}} {{countermeasures}} against invasions. If the wasps detect an intruder they will violently bite and sting the location where the C. iphitalis moth has passed by. This will cause vibrations {{inside of the}} nest and the wasps inside will become alarmed and will move around jerkily. This phenomenon {{is known as the}} parasite dance. This will continue for up to 10 hours after <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> has been detected. If <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> is found it will be eaten immediately. However, this is not likely to happen. <b>The</b> <b>moth</b> lays its eggs in the nest, and when they hatch, they will take over the nest. As a result, many wasp pupae are aborted. This is commonly seen in the late summer when <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> is most abundant.|$|E
5|$|The yucca, Yucca whipplei, is pollinated {{exclusively}} by Tegeticula maculata, a yucca moth {{that depends on}} the yucca for survival. <b>The</b> <b>moth</b> eats the seeds of the plant, while gathering pollen. The pollen has evolved to become very sticky, and remains on the mouth parts when <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> moves to the next flower. The yucca provides a place for <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> to lay its eggs, deep within the flower away from potential predators.|$|E
25|$|Firewood is {{a common}} way to {{transport}} eggs, since <b>the</b> <b>moths</b> will lay their eggs on dead wood. Attempts {{have been made to}} limit the movement of firewood to reduce <b>the</b> <b>moth's</b> spread.|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> Bogong <b>moth</b> (Agrotis infusa) migrates {{annually}} {{to the highest}} peaks in the Southern Alps where millions spend the hot summer months aestivating in deep, dark crevices in rock caves among granite boulders. Parliament House disrupts the flight of <b>the</b> <b>moths,</b> writes Bill McCormick, and acts as a giant light trap for <b>moths</b> migrating through <b>the</b> Canberra area during October and November. <b>The</b> <b>moths</b> treat <b>the</b> building as a temporary camp and it is often necessary to reduce the building 2 ̆ 7 s lighting to allow <b>the</b> <b>moths</b> to continue their migration south...|$|R
5|$|After {{completing}} all but {{its last}} moult, the caterpillar spins a cocoon out of silk. The cocoon {{can be in}} the tree crown or between two leaves, but is most often near the ground, between moss and bark. It is an open network cocoon with large and irregular mesh. In the warm season, the cocoon takes about 10 hours to spin, the metamorphosis takes place about 29 hours later and lasts about 6 minutes. These durations are slightly longer in the cold season. The chrysalis stage lasts 17 days in November, the warmest month, and 23 days in July, the coldest month. Five to six days before eclosion, the motifs of the wings start to become visible. <b>The</b> <b>moth</b> emerges during the night or in low light, by splitting the pupal case from the top. Once out of the pupal exuvia (the pupal exoskeleton), <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> finds a horizontal surface, from which it suspends itself by its four anterior legs. The wings are deployed in about 10 minutes, by pumping haemolymph into the wing veins. <b>The</b> <b>moth</b> then beats them a few times, waits 45 minutes to let them harden, then beats them lightly again. <b>The</b> <b>moth</b> finally takes flight between one and a half to two hours later.|$|E
5|$|Another habit <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> has {{in common}} with many {{butterflies}} is the night resting posture—the wings are held vertically over the back. During their migrations they roost in a group for the night. <b>The</b> <b>moth</b> flies over the crown of trees and in clearings. Sometimes because of high winds it is carried about 100m (300ft), it then falls, inert and wings closed, to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Continuous {{generations of}} <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> are present all year. The highest populations are found from March to August (fall and winter), while the lowest are from October to December (spring).|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> {{peppered}} <b>moth</b> {{exists in}} both {{light and dark}} colours in Great Britain, but during the industrial revolution, many of the trees on which <b>the</b> <b>moths</b> rested became blackened by soot, giving <b>the</b> dark-coloured <b>moths</b> an advantage in hiding from predators. This gave dark-coloured moths {{a better chance of}} surviving to produce dark-coloured offspring, and in just fifty years from <b>the</b> first dark <b>moth</b> being caught, nearly all of <b>the</b> <b>moths</b> in industrial Manchester were dark. The balance was reversed by the effect of the Clean Air Act 1956, and <b>the</b> dark <b>moths</b> became rare again, demonstrating the influence of natural selection on peppered moth evolution.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> gypsy <b>moth</b> was {{introduced}} into North America in 1869 from Europe and quickly became an invasive species. [...] Étienne Léopold Trouvelot imported <b>the</b> <b>moths,</b> with <b>the</b> intent of interbreeding gypsy moths with silk worms {{to develop a}} silkworm industry. <b>The</b> <b>moths</b> were accidentally released from his residence in Medford, Massachusetts. There are conflicting reports on the resulting actions. One states that despite issuing oral and written warnings of possible consequences, no officials were willing to assist in searching out and destroying <b>the</b> <b>moths.</b> <b>The</b> other notes that {{he was aware of}} the risk and there is no direct evidence that he contacted government officials.|$|R
5|$|The Madagascan sunset moth {{was first}} {{described}} by the British entomologist Dru Drury in 1773 from a specimen obtained from a Captain May of Hammersmith. Because of its resemblance to swallowtail butterflies, Drury described the species as Papilio rhipheus. The specimen Drury received had {{the head of a}} different species attached, probably that of a butterfly, which had clubbed antennae—this trait is frequently used to differentiate moths from butterflies. Once the inaccuracy in Drury's specimen was found, <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> was placed in the genus Urania, until 1823 when the German entomologist Jacob Hübner placed it in a new genus, Chrysiridia. <b>The</b> <b>moth</b> has also been described under other names. Because Drury described his specimen as having clubbed antennae and being tailless, William Swainson thought it was a different species than the complete specimen described by Cramer. In 1833, Swainson named the butterfly Rhipheus dasycephalus and <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> Leilus orientalis. Other synonyms include U. crameri by Maassen in 1879 and U. ripheus var. madagascariensis by Lesson in 1831.|$|E

5|$|The sunset moth {{is black}} with {{iridescent}} red, {{blue and green}} markings. There is a fringe of white scales on the wing edges, wider on the hindwings. <b>The</b> <b>moth</b> has six tails, very often lost or damaged during its life. Pattern variations are common, and <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> is often partly asymmetrical; {{one of the factors}} causing this is temperature shock during the pupal stage.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, Malawi {{was hit by}} a drought, and in January 2017, {{the country}} {{reported}} an outbreak of armyworms around Zomba. <b>The</b> <b>moth</b> is capable of wiping out entire fields of corn, the staple grain of impoverished residents. On 14 January 2017, the agriculture minister George Chaponda reported that 2,000 hectares of crop had been destroyed, having spread to nine of twenty-eight districts.|$|E
5|$|On stage, Dodd {{performed}} {{the role of}} Darky Morris in a 1966 J.C. Williamson stage production of Desire of <b>the</b> <b>Moth,</b> with a season of nearly three months in Melbourne and Sydney.

5|$|Predators {{including}} Cactoblastis cactorum (mentioned above) {{can also}} be used to destroy invasive plant species. As another example, the poison hemlock moth (Agonopterix alstroemeriana) can be used to control poison hemlock (Conium maculatum). During its larval stage, <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> strictly consumes its host plant, poison hemlock, and can exist at hundreds of larvae per individual host plant, destroying large swathes of the hemlock.|$|E

50|$|Kettlewell first {{devised a}} {{standard}} procedure for scoring <b>the</b> <b>moths.</b> It {{was necessary to}} determine how far apart <b>the</b> <b>moths</b> should be placed so they were indistinguishable from their backgrounds. Correct separation would result in effective and selective predation by birds, because if <b>the</b> <b>moths</b> were all too close then birds {{would be able to}} differentiate even well camouflaged individuals. He tested his scoring method in the woodlands near Birmingham by releasing 651 peppered moths (consisting of typica, carbonaria and insularia), and then at an aviary at the Research Station in Madingley in Cambridge. In the aviary he released 69 moths, which he allowed two great tits (Parus major) to prey upon. He found that the initial procedure failed, as the birds actively looked for any moth, regardless of their colour or background. He succeeded only by using freshly captured moths consisting of 9 black and 8 white types, which he released separately. He found that the birds preferentially caught <b>the</b> <b>moths</b> according to <b>the</b> background colour on which <b>the</b> <b>moths</b> were present.|$|R
50|$|Although {{replaced}} in production by <b>the</b> DH.60G-III <b>Moth</b> Major {{and later by}} <b>the</b> DH.82 Tiger <b>Moth,</b> <b>the</b> Gipsy <b>Moth</b> remained <b>the</b> mainstay of the British flying scene up {{to the start of}} WWII. The war however marked the end of <b>the</b> Gipsy <b>Moth</b> and post-war it was quickly replaced by ex-RAF Tiger <b>Moths</b> pouring into <b>the</b> civilian market.|$|R
5|$|The Madagascan sunset moth {{appeared}} on a 6 maloti postage stamp in the Lesotho Postal Services Butterflies of Africa issue of 20 August 2007. Only {{one of the four}} species of host plants, Omphalea oppositifolia, is used to raise <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> commercially, mainly using plants collected in the wild, but also some cultivated for the purpose.|$|E
5|$|Baculoviruses are {{specific}} to individual insect host species and {{have been shown to}} be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus has been used to spray large areas of forest in North America where larvae of the gypsy moth are causing serious defoliation. <b>The</b> <b>moth</b> larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.|$|E
5|$|By {{repeated}} scanning, bats can mentally {{construct an}} accurate {{image of the}} environment in which they are moving and of their prey item. However, some species of moth have exploited this, such as the tiger moths which produces aposematic ultrasound signals to warn bats that they are chemically protected. Other moth species can produce signals to jam bat echolocation. Many moth species have a hearing organ called a tympanum, which responds to an incoming bat signal by causing the moth's flight muscles to twitch erratically, sending <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> into random evasive maneuvers.|$|E
50|$|The {{forest is}} also an {{important}} site for <b>the</b> Kentish Glory <b>moth</b> (Endromis versicolora), who exploit the forestry activity carried out by the Forestry Commission. The timber felling generates spaces for birch saplings to take root, the larval food plant of <b>the</b> <b>moths,</b> who prefer saplings below three metres tall. <b>The</b> <b>moths</b> follow <b>the</b> timber felling around the forest, and the adults can be seen in April-May.|$|R
40|$|The complex {{mutualism}} between yuccas and <b>the</b> <b>moths</b> that pollinate their flowers {{is regarded}} as one of the most obvious cases of coevolution. Studies of related genera show that at least two of the critical behavioral and life history traits suggested to have resulted from coevolved mutualism in yucca moths are plesiomorphic to the family. Another trait, oviposition into flowers, has evolved repeatedly within the family. One species with these traits, Greya politella, feeds on and pollinates plants of a different family, but pollination occurs through a different component of the oviposition behavior than in <b>the</b> yucca <b>moths.</b> Major differences compared with yucca moths and their hosts are that G. politella only passively pollinates its host and that copollinators often contribute to pollination. This analysis suggests that evolution of mutualism between yuccas and yucca moths may have required few behavioral and life history changes in <b>the</b> <b>moths.</b> <b>The</b> truly coevolved features of this interaction appear to be the evolution of active pollination by <b>the</b> <b>moths,</b> <b>the</b> associated morphological structures in <b>the</b> <b>moths</b> for carrying pollen, and the exclusion of copollinators by yuccas...|$|R

5|$|For newly emerged {{adults of}} most {{myrmecophilous}} Lycaenidae, deciduous waxy scales provide some protection from predators as they {{emerge from the}} nest. In the case of <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> butterfly (Liphyra brassolis), the caterpillars are unwelcome guests in nests of tree ants, feeding on ant larvae. The adults emerging from pupae are covered with soft, loose adhesive scales which rub off and stick on the ants as {{they make their way}} out of the nest after hatching.|$|E
5|$|Helicoverpa zea, {{commonly}} known as the corn earworm, is a species (formerly in the genus Heliothis) in the family Noctuidae. The larva of <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> Helicoverpa zea is a major agricultural pest. Since it is polyphagous (feeds on many different plants) during the larval stage, the species has been given many different common names, including the cotton bollworm and the tomato fruitworm. It also consumes a wide variety of other crops.|$|E
5|$|Many {{other species}} have become {{naturalized}} outside the Americas {{after having been}} introduced by people, especially in Australia, Hawaii, and the Mediterranean region. In Australia, species of Opuntia, particularly Opuntia stricta, were introduced in the 19th century for use as natural agricultural fences and {{in an attempt to}} establish a cochineal industry. They rapidly became a major weed problem, but are now controlled by biological agents, particularly <b>the</b> <b>moth</b> Cactoblastis cactorum. The weed potential of Opuntia species in Australia continues however, leading to all opuntioid cacti except O. ficus-indica being declared Weeds of National Significance by the Australian Weeds Committee in April 2012.|$|E
