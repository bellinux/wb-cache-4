40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} if there is a difference in performance and experienced mental workload between 2 -D and 3 -D simulations of airport tower air traffic control. The air traffic control task was to give aircraft <b>take-off</b> and landing <b>clearances.</b> A total of ten subjects, all university students, participated in the study. All subjects were exposed to both 2 -D and 3 -D simulations. The order between 2 -D and 3 -D was rotated to exclude order effects. Performance was judged using a rating form used by the Swedish Air Traffic Services Academy. After each simulation the subjects were required to rate their mental workload on NASA-TLX. The results show no statistically significant differences between 2 -D and 3 -D with respect to performance or experienced workload. When looking at the raw data tendencies can be found for the 3 -D to yield better performance and less mental load. This merits further study with a larger number of subjects and scenarios.

40|$|The {{main task}} {{of an air}} traffic {{controller}} is to assure safety in aviation. For safe decisions the controller must keep a sufficient picture of the current situation by scanning all relevant information visually. Ice-crean was developed from prior studies {{as a tool to}} observe controllers’ scanning behaviour and indicate unattended information sources. A total of eight air traffic controllers participated in a high fidelity simulation study in which the controller coordinated IFR-traffic at a regional airport. The eye movements were continuously measured. During <b>take-off</b> and landing <b>clearances</b> the ice-crean logic analysed the controller’s scanning behaviour in real time and compared it with the predicted gazes due to database. As a result the ice-crean tool recognised which information had not been observed and responded accordingly by visual indication. Comprehensibility respecting the indication and the acceptance towards the ice-crean concept were interrogated. The tool’s indications were mostly perceived to be correct and comprehensible. The tool was evaluated positively and rated reasonable in tower operations as well as possibly helpful also in other application areas with minor restrictions. The study offers implications for actual implementation of ice-crean in airport towers and further areas. Assets and drawbacks of the tool are discussed...|$|R
50|$|At 10.02 WIB, Flight 91 {{received}} <b>clearance</b> for <b>take-off</b> {{with additional}} <b>clearance</b> from ATC to turn left heading 120 and maintain 1500 ft. The crew read back the clearance heading 120 and maintaining 1000 ft. The ATC corrected the clearance to “one thousand five hundred feet.” The crew re-read it back as 1500 ft. The plane later took off. Some {{of the passengers}} and other witnesses stated that the aircraft had lifted its nose in an up attitude and take off roll was longer than that normally made by similar airplanes. Most of them stated that the aircraft nose began to lift-off a few meters {{from the end of}} the runway. The ATC tower controller recalled that after rotation the plane began to “roll” or veer to the left and to the right. Eyewitnesses on the ground also reported the same. Witnesses stated that the plane shook violently (possibly indicating a stall). The airplane then overran the departure end of Runway 23, impacted several approach lights, traveled through a grass area and over a river. Some witnesses on the ground recalled that the airplane left wing struck a building before it struck in the busy road, then heard two big explosions and saw the flames. As the airplane came to rest, it fractured into three parts.The airplane was considered a total loss due to the impact forces and post-crash fire. The aircraft had been separated due to impact along the flight track beginning {{from the end of the}} runway 23, and then the aircraft came to a halt 540 m from the end of runway. Most of the fuselage section was destroyed by post-impact fire. The remaining part of the fuselage was only the tail section. Both engines detached from the aircraft due to the impact to the ground. The right engine was found about 300 m and the left engine about 400 m from the end of the Runway 23.|$|R
50|$|Brake release {{weight is}} {{the weight of}} an {{aircraft}} {{at the start of}} a runway, just prior to brake release for take-off. This is the ramp weight minus any fuel used for taxiing. Major airports may have runways that are about 2 miles (3 km) long, so merely taxiing from the terminal to the end of the runway might consume up to a ton of fuel. After taxiing, the pilot lines up the aircraft with the runway and puts the brakes on. On receiving <b>take-off</b> <b>clearance,</b> the pilot throttles up the engines and releases the brakes to start accelerating along the runway in preparation for taking off.|$|E

40|$|On large {{airports}} {{with numerous}} departures per hour, controllers need to organize departing aircraft {{in such a}} way that maximum throughput is achieved. The demanded initial spacing of departures from the same runway, or dependent runways, poses a limiting factor. On most airports, an aircraft that follows the same departure pattern as its predecessor, a so called “in-trail departure”, requires radar separation of 3 nautical miles (NM). If the departure direction diverges more than 15 degrees, controllers may apply reduced initial spacing of 2, 400 meters (approx. 1. 3 NM) according to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), or 6000 feet (ft) according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which allows earlier <b>take-off</b> <b>clearance</b> for following traffic, and thus higher throughput of the airport. The Unified Departure Operation Spacing (UDOS) concept allows the controller to apply reduced initial spacing, even for in-trail departures, if certain conditions are met. Those conditions include non-increasing distance to the preceding aircraft until radar separation is established, a Standard Instrument Departure (SID) with a target speed, established separation after at most 10 NM along track, and the presence of jet engines on the according aircraft. This paper investigates the departure situation on a large German airport hub and determines the potential of the UDOS concept on this particular airport. The current separation standards, including definitions of both ICAO and FAA, as well as the UDOS concept are reviewed. Prerequisites for the application of UDOS on that airport hub are presented and evaluated. Real data of departure operations on the airport in focus is available for multiple days of operation, including detailed information on the aircraft type, the actual take-off time (ATOT), and the assigned SID. By using this information, a baseline scenario for each available day of operations is constructed and investigated on presumably applied separation. Subsequently, an optimized departure scenario is established, allowing reduced initial spacing, and thus faster <b>take-off</b> <b>clearance,</b> whenever a flight qualifies for reduced separation. The qualification is determined by the evaluation of anticipated trajectories, based on the given SID route, the aircraft type, and a fuel weight estimation considering the designated arrival airport. A theoretical gain in departures per hour, when using the UDOS concept, is determined. Simulation of these scenarios is performed by operating the simulation environment of DLR's Institute of Flight Guidance. Departure trajectories are created with the air traffic simulator TrafficSim, which has been designed to support development of air traffic scenarios. It uses EUROCONTROL's Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) in order to generate precise trajectories for many different aircraft types, and is capable of simulating up to 30, 000 aircraft in real time. All aircraft in the investigated scenarios are equipped with a flight management system (FMS) that can satisfy altitude constraints as well as time constraints and speed constraints. Conflict-freeness of the optimized scenario is ensured by using highly precise and fast conflict detection algorithms available in DLR's FATS...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Currently at many airports, runway is the {{limiting}} {{factor for the}} overall throughput. Among the most important parameters are the fixed wake turbulence separation minima expressed in time for <b>take-off</b> <b>clearance</b> and by distance for arrivals on final approach. This wake turbulence separation limits the arrival and departure flow on many airports in Europe already today. Existing departure and arrival wake turbulence separations are sometimes considered over conservative as they do {{not take into account}} meteorological conditions likely to shift, reduce or alleviate their circulations. This paper will present the main aspects of a SESAR project that defines, analyses and develops a verified wake turbulence system according to related operational concept improvements in order to, punctually or permanently, reduce landing and departure wake turbulence separations and, therefore, to increase the runway throughput {{in such a way that}} it safely absorbs arrival demand peaks and/or reduces departure delays. This global objective will be achieved by means of developing a wake vortex decision support system able to deliver in real time position and strength of the wake vortices and to predict their behavior and potential impact on safety and capacity, taking in account actual weather information as well as the airport specific climatological conditions, aircraft characteristics (generated wake vortex and wake vortex sensitivity) and airport runways layout. These functionalities will be progressively included in the wake vortex decision support system to be validated and deployed on airports in order to optimize the runway throughput and reduce delays.
