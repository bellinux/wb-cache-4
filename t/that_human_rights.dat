5|$|Recent {{literature}} exploring bioethical {{questions from}} a human rights perspective has been criticised on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> theory contains unresolved problems. Bioethicists have claimed that bioethical inquiry can contribute to resolving these problems. Cochrane claims that this contribution to human rights literature offers three insights, but {{that these are not}} entirely original. These insights are questions about institutional fairness, rights as trumps and rights as solely belonging to humans. Cochrane holds <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> should be reconceptualised as sentient rights. The grounding of human rights, he claims, are not distinct from the grounding of human obligations to nonhuman animals, and attempts to distinguish human rights from the rights of other sentient beings ultimately fail.|$|E
5|$|Hentoff {{was known}} as a civil libertarian, free speech activist, anti-death penalty advocate, and anti-abortion advocate. He {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the State of Israel. Hentoff espoused generally liberal views on domestic policy and civil liberties, but in the 1980s, he began articulating more socially conservative positions—opposition to abortion, voluntary euthanasia, and the selective medical treatment of severely disabled infants. Hentoff argued that a consistent life ethic should be the viewpoint of a genuine civil libertarian, arguing that all human rights are at risk when the rights of any one group of people are diminished, <b>that</b> <b>human</b> <b>rights</b> are interconnected, and people deny others' human rights at their peril.|$|E
