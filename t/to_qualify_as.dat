5|$|UEFA Euro 1996 {{was a more}} {{positive}} experience for both Shearer and England. With England not required <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> hosts, Shearer had not scored in 12 games in the 21 months prior, and even his overall goalscoring record for England did not look too impressive so far; five goals in 23 games.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, Eichelberger {{became the}} Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point. He instituted {{a number of}} reforms, cutting back {{activities}} such as horseback riding and close order drill, and substituting modern combat training, in which cadets participated in military exercises alongside National Guard units. He acquired Stewart Field as a training facility, which gave cadets a chance <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> pilots while still at West Point. He became commander of the 77th Infantry Division in March 1942, and I Corps in June.|$|E

5|$|The Constitution vests {{the three}} {{branches}} of the state with different aspects of governmental power. The executive {{is made up of}} the President and the Cabinet, which is headed by the Prime Minister. The Cabinet is accountable to the electorate and is an embodiment of representative democracy.

5|$|With Liverpool, Liddell {{competed in}} the various {{regional}} leagues that the FA assigned the club to and scored 82 goals in 152 matches between 1940 and 1946. He debuted on 1 January 1940 against Crewe Alexandra, scoring after two minutes in a 7–3 win. In his formative years, Liddell credited Matt Busby and Berry Nieuwenhuys as significant influences. He volunteered for the Royal Air Force and, despite wanting <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> a pilot, was trained as a navigator because of his proficiency at mathematics. After being mobilised in December 1942, Liddell guested with Chelsea and Cambridge Town. He broke his leg in a friendly kickabout while stationed in Bridgnorth, which required admission to the RAF Remedial Centre at Blackpool.|$|E
5|$|In American football, passing, {{along with}} running (also {{referred}} to as rushing), {{is one of the}} two main methods of advancing the ball down the field. Passes are typically attempted by the quarterback, but any offensive player can attempt a pass provided they are behind the line of scrimmage. <b>To</b> <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> a passing play, the ball must have initially moved forward after leaving the hands of the passer; if the ball initially moved laterally or backwards, the play would instead be considered a running play. A player who catches a forward pass is a receiver, and the number of receiving yards each player has recorded in each season is a recorded stat in football games. In addition to the overall National Football League (NFL) receiving champion, league record books recognize statistics from the American Football League (AFL), which operated from 1960 to 1969 before being absorbed into the NFL in 1970, Although league record books do not recognize stats from the All-America Football Conference, another league that merged with the NFL, these statistics are recognized by the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the family's poverty, by pooling {{resources}} Zhu was chosen {{to be sent to}} a regional private school in 1892. At age nine he was adopted by his prosperous uncle, whose political influence allowed him to gain access to Yunnan Military Academy. Before the suspension of imperial examinations in 1906, he attained the rank of Xiucai, which allowed him <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> a civil servant. He enrolled in a Sichuan high school around 1907 and graduated in 1908. Subsequently, he returned to Yilong's primary school as a gym instructor. An advocate of modern science and political teaching rather than the strict classical education afforded by schools, he was dismissed from his post and entered the Yunnan Military Academy in Kunming. There he joined the Beiyang Army and the Tongmenghui secret political society (the forerunner of the Kuomintang).|$|E

5|$|On April 6, 2008, {{a seven-year-old}} boy accidentally started {{a fire in}} a nearby {{campground}} while playing with matches. The fire moved up the riverbank and destroyed the bridge's wooden deck and rails. The county funded a study to determine the feasibility and cost of reconstructing the bridge. The engineers determined that the steel cables and towers most likely did not suffer structural damage and could be reused. The study estimated reconstruction costs at $850,000. The engineers determined the original blueprints, preserved in a museum, were of sufficient quality that only minimal engineering work would be required. The county agreed to direct the effort, but will not fund it with taxpayer money. As replicas do not qualify for historical status, historians are debating if using the original towers and cable is enough for the structure <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> historical. Grand County has set up an account for interested parties to donate to the reconstruction effort.|$|E
5|$|Shepard was {{assigned}} to Fighter Squadron 42 (VF-42), flying the Vought F4U Corsair. The squadron was nominally based on the aircraft carrier , but the ship was being overhauled at the time Shepard arrived, {{and in the meantime}} the squadron was based at Naval Air Station Norfolk in Virginia. He departed on his first cruise, of the Caribbean, on Franklin D. Roosevelt with VF-42 in 1948. Most of the aviators were, like Shepard, on their first assignment. Those that were not were given the opportunity to qualify for night landings on a carrier, a dangerous maneuver, especially in a Corsair, which had to bank sharply on approach. Shepard managed to persuade his squadron commander to allow him <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> well. After briefly returning to Norfolk, the carrier set out on a nine-month tour of the Mediterranean Sea. He earned a reputation for carousing and chasing women. He also instituted a ritual of, whenever he could, calling Louise at 17:00 (her time) each day.|$|E
5|$|Stokvis {{was close}} to the {{influential}} German pathologist Rudolf Virchow. In 1879 Stokvis was elected a member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, and he served as vice-president of the Academy in 1896. He was awarded received an honorary Doctorate of Laws by the University of Edinburgh in 1884. Stokvis also chaired the 1883 International Colonial Medicine Congress in Amsterdam. He was one of the founders (in 1896) of Janus, an international journal for the history of medicine. He is regarded as an illustrious member of Holland's medical dynasty, and as a pioneer in the fields of chemical physiology and chemotherapy. Together with Samuel Siegmund Rosenstein, professor of medicine in Leiden, he was a supporter of Aletta Jacobs, the first woman <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> a doctor in the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|The New Hospital for Women {{moved to}} No.144 Euston Road in 1888, and was rebuilt by J.M. Brydon two years later. It housed 42 beds and was staffed entirely by women, {{which made it}} a {{comfortable}} environment for patients with gynaecological problems. It was renamed the Elizabeth Garrett Anderson Hospital in 1918 {{following the death of}} the hospital's founder, Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, the first woman in England <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> a doctor of medicine. The Euston Road premises closed in 1993, its services transferred to University College Hospital. The current hospital is at No.235. The Wellcome Trust, a private medical research charity, was established in 1936 and has premises at No.183 and No.210 Euston Road. Its library holds about half a million books, including more than 6,000 Sanskrit manuscripts and the largest collection of Hindi and Punjabi medical documents in Europe. Its objects were transferred on permanent loan to the Science Museum in 1976. The University College London Hospital's archives are at No250 Euston Road.|$|E
5|$|The qualifiers for the 2002 World Cup {{ended with}} Georgia {{finishing}} in third place, ahead of Hungary and Lithuania.

Kaladze only played in three matches during the Euro 2004 qualifiers, where Georgia finished in last place in the group. He did, however, feature in a 1–0 victory over neighbouring Russia, a victory considered to be one of Georgia's greatest successes. Kaladze played in {{all but one of the}} 2006 World Cup qualifying matches, where Georgia finished sixth in the group, with Kazakhstan being the only team to finish below them. He played fewer matches during the qualification for Euro 2008 and once again Georgia failed <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> they finished in sixth place despite starting their campaign with a 6–0 win over the Faroe Islands.|$|E
5|$|The speech made Breckinridge {{a target}} of Whigs, Young Americans, and Douglas supporters. Humphrey Marshall, a Kentucky Whig who {{supported}} incumbent President Millard Fillmore, attacked Breckinridge for claiming Fillmore had not fully disclosed his views on slavery. Illinois' William Alexander Richardson, a Douglas backer, tried to distance Douglas from Sanders' attacks on Butler, but Breckinridge showed that Douglas endorsed the Democratic Review a month after it printed its first anti-Butler article. Finally, Breckinridge's cousin, California's Edward C. Marshall, charged that Butler would name Breckinridge Attorney General {{in exchange for his}} support and revived the charge that Breckinridge broke party ranks, supporting Zachary Taylor for president. Breckinridge ably defended himself, but Sanders continued to attack him and Butler, claiming Butler would name Breckinridge as his running mate, even though Breckinridge was too young <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> <b>as</b> vice president.|$|E
