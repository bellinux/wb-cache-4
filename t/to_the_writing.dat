5|$|Also {{like her}} mother, whose Letters from Sweden was {{foundational}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> of both History of a Six Weeks' Tour and Rambles, Shelley emphasised her maternal {{role in the}} text. She describes herself as a conventional figure, worrying about her son. Rather than the scandal-ridden young woman of her youth, which she wrote about in the Tour, she is now a demure, respectable, middle-aged woman.|$|E
5|$|According to Brelsford, {{the elderly}} Harrison Clark {{remained}} highly respected among {{the indigenous people}} and was sometimes called upon to settle disputes. His last job was personnel manager at a local mine. He dedicated his final years <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> of {{a book about his}} life, the manuscript for which was lost when his house burned down. Clark alleged that the BSAC orchestrated the fire to stop him from publishing unflattering information about the early days of Company rule. He died from heart disease in Broken Hill on 9 December 1927, aged about 67, and was buried in the Protestant section of the town cemetery. The modest savings he possessed {{at the time of his}} death were left to his sister in Port Elizabeth.|$|E

The teacher voice encodes the engagement meaning of [proclaim] by acting <b>to</b> limit <b>the</b> students’ scope of focus. Her instruction to S 8 in message 99 further encodes the meaning [pronounce] whereby she explicitly intervenes to assert her proposition for <b>the</b> student <b>to</b> focus on <b>the</b> <b>written</b> text. By overtly directing <b>the</b> student focus <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>written</b> text, <b>the</b> teacher directs the reading path of the picture book which is to attend first <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>written</b> text on <b>the</b> page before its visual image.|$|R

5|$|As the {{tradition}} of Troilus the warrior advances through time, the weaponry and the form of combat change. Already in Dares he is a mounted warrior, not a charioteer or foot warrior, something anachronistic to epic narrative. In later versions he is a knight with armour appropriate {{to the time of}} writing who fights against other knights and dukes. His expected conduct, including his romance, conforms to courtly or other values contemporary <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Formal {{charges against}} the group were {{presented}} on June 4, the indictment running to 2,800 pages. By late June 2012, disquiet over the trio's detention without setting a trial date and concern over what was regarded as excessive and arbitrary treatment, led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> of an open letter. It was signed by leading opposition figures, {{as well as by}} director Fyodor Bondarchuk, a supporter of Putin, and actors Chulpan Khamatova and Yevgeny Mironov, both of whom had appeared in campaign videos supporting Putin's re-election. Singer Alla Pugachyova appealed on the women's behalf, stating that they should be ordered to perform community service rather than imprisoned. Meanwhile, Nikita Mikhalkov, head of the Russian Cinematographers' Union, stated that he would gladly sign an open letter against them.|$|E
5|$|Joan of Arc is a 1796 epic poem {{composed}} by Robert Southey. The {{idea for the}} story came from a discussion between Southey and Grosvenor Bedford, when Southey realised that the story would be suitable for an epic. The subject further appealed to Southey because {{the events of the}} French Revolution were concurrent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> of the poem and would serve as a parallel to current events. Eventually, Samuel Taylor Coleridge helped rewrite parts of the poem for a 1798 edition. Later editions removed Coleridge's additions along with other changes.|$|E

No Shakespearean poems were included in the First Folio.|$|E
5|$|The book {{became a}} bestseller and was well {{received}} by {{graduates of the}} est training. Reviewers generally commented that the book was favorable to Erhard, {{and a number of}} critics felt that it was unduly so, or lacked objectivity, citing Bartley's close relationship to Erhard. Responses <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> were mixed; while some reviewers found it well written and entertaining, others felt the tone was too slick, promotional, or hagiographic.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the two Eon Productions Bond films {{released}} prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> of the novel (Dr. No and From Russia with Love) were reflected in the novel through the increased number of gadgets used. One of these was the poison gun used in {{the scene of the}} attempted assassination of M. The idea was taken from the story of Bohdan Stashynsky, who defected from the Eastern Bloc to the West in 1961. Stashynsky was put on trial for the murder of Ukrainian nationalist leaders Lev Rebet and Stepan Bandera and stated that he had used a poison-spray gun to do it.|$|E

The show has received mixed reception; it has been criticised for its embedded marketing, while reviewers have given praise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing.</b> Several crew members have additionally received accolades for their work on the show. The series finale aired on June 4, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Ganino and Stillwell {{completed}} their new combined story {{in about a}} week. The writers spent hours each day at Stillwell's apartment working over every detail; they felt pressured {{to write a story}} Piller would find acceptable, as they wanted {{to have the opportunity to}} write the teleplay. The story treatment was turned in on October 10. Piller immediately decided to purchase the story and distributed the treatment <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> staff while he discussed changes. Piller felt that Data's romantic feelings for TashaYar were over the top, and that an alien probe which served as a central part of the story was a cheat in terms of resolving Picard's dilemma. The writer wanted Ganino and Stillwell to enhance Guinan's role and to find another character arc for TashaYar. A revised treatment was submitted on October 29, incorporating Piller's changes. The writers were not involved in development of the teleplay. They were each paid the Writers Guild minimum of $2400.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{attraction}} Fleming felt working alongside McClory {{was based on}} McClory's film, The Boy and the Bridge, which was the official British entry to the 1959 Venice Film Festival. However, when the film was released in July 1959, it was poorly received, and did not do well at the box office; Fleming became disenchanted with McClory's ability as a result. In October 1959, with Fleming spending less time on the project, McClory introduced experienced screenwriter Jack Whittingham <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> process. In November 1959 Fleming left to travel {{around the world on}} behalf of The Sunday Times, material for which Fleming also used for his non-fiction travel book, Thrilling Cities. On his travels—through Japan, Hong Kong and into the US—Fleming met with McClory and Ivar Bryce in New York and McClory told Fleming that Whittingham had completed a full outline, which was ready to shoot. Back in Britain in December 1959, Fleming met with McClory and Whittingham for a script conference; shortly afterwards McClory and Whittingham sent Fleming a script, Longitude 78 West, which Fleming considered to be good, although he changed the title to Thunderball.|$|E
