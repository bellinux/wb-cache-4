5|$|The team {{created new}} engines <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>their</b> needs for the game. The {{artificial}} intelligence {{was created to}} coordinate with players; the addition of Ellie as artificial intelligence was {{a major contributor to}} the engine. The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light, in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces. The gameplay introduced difficulty to the team, as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis. The game's user interface design also underwent various iterations throughout development.|$|E
5|$|Human Rights Watch {{estimates}} UNITA and {{the government}} employed more than 6,000 and 3,000 child soldiers, respectively, some forcibly impressed, during the war. Additionally, human rights analysts found that between 5,000 and 8,000 underage girls were married to UNITA militants. Some girls were ordered to go and forage for food {{to provide for the}} troops – the girls were denied food if they did not bring back enough <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>their</b> commander. After victories, UNITA commanders would be rewarded with women, who were often then sexually abused. The Angolan government and UN agencies identified 190 child soldiers in the Angolan army, and had relocated 70 of them by November 2002, but the government continued to knowingly employ other underage soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The Pranatoshini Tantra (18th century) narrates two {{tales of}} Chhinnamasta's birth. One legend, {{attributed}} to the Narada-pancharatra, tells how once, while bathing in Mandakini river, Parvati becomes sexually excited, and turns black. At the same time, her two female attendants Dakini and Varnini (also called Jaya and Vijaya) become extremely hungry and beg for food. Though Parvati initially promises to give them food once they return home, the merciful goddess beheads herself with her nails and gives her blood <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>their</b> hunger. Later, they return home after Parvati rejoins her head.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of socioeconomic-cultural homogamy on the marital and sexual satisfaction of Hong Kong Chinese couples. Using a representative, territory-wide sample of 1, 083 first-time married heterosexual couples, this study found that wives were generally less <b>satisfied</b> than <b>their</b> husbands with their marital and sexual relationships. Husbands were more likely <b>to</b> be <b>satisfied</b> with <b>their</b> marriages when they were {{two to four years}} older than their wives than when they were of similar age to their wives (i. e., within one year of each other), but they were less likely <b>to</b> be <b>satisfied</b> with <b>their</b> marriages when only their wives were employed than when both partners were employed. In addition, they were less likely <b>to</b> be <b>satisfied</b> with both <b>their</b> marital and sexual relationships when their wives were five or more years older. Wives with an older husband were more likely <b>to</b> be sexually <b>satisfied</b> than wives of the same age as their husband, but they were less likely <b>to</b> be <b>satisfied</b> with <b>their</b> marriages when they were better educated than their husbands.

5|$|Butch {{women were}} not a novelty in the 1950s; even in Harlem and Greenwich Village in the 1920s some women assumed these personae. In the 1950s and 1960s, however, the roles were {{pervasive}} and not limited to North America: from 1940 to 1970, butch/femme bar culture flourished in Britain, though there were fewer class distinctions. They further identified {{members of a group}} that had been marginalized; women who had been rejected by most of society had an inside view of an exclusive group of people that took a high amount of knowledge to function in. Butch and femme were considered coarse by American lesbians of higher social standing during this period. Many wealthier women married <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>their</b> familial obligations, and others escaped to Europe to live as expatriates.|$|E
5|$|The {{genesis of}} {{the removal of the}} HNC was a power {{struggle}} within the ruling junta. Khánh, who had been saved from an earlier coup attempt in September 1964 by the intervention of some younger generals dubbed the Young Turks, was indebted to them and needed <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>their</b> wishes to stay in power. The Young Turks disliked a group of older officers who had been in high leadership positions but were now in powerless posts, and wanted to sideline them completely. As a result, they decided to hide their political motives by introducing a policy to compulsorily retire all general officers with more than 25 years of service. The chief of state Phan Khắc Sửu, an elderly figure appointed by the military to give a semblance of civilian rule, did not want to sign the decree without the agreement of the HNC, which mostly consisted of old men. The HNC recommended against the new policy, and the younger officers, led by I Corps commander General Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, disbanded the body and arrested some of its members along with other politicians.|$|E
5|$|The {{practical}} side of Hadley's proposal {{rests on}} two key principles: a guardianship system, {{according to which}} knowledgeable guardians would be appointed to represent animal property holders in land management decision-making, {{and the use of}} animals' territory-marking behaviour to determine the limits of their property. Hadley rejects first occupancy and labour-mixing accounts of appropriation, and instead suggests that there are two ways that his account might fruitfully be justified. First, it might be justified directly, with reference to the interests of animals. This relies upon the fact that wild animals require their territory in order <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>their</b> basic needs and the claim that this results in an interest in territory strong enough to ground a right. If animals have a right to use their territory, Hadley claims, then they necessarily have a property right in that territory. Second, it might be justified indirectly, as animals (of some species, at least) might be given property rights as a means of protecting natural environments. Hadley presents his proposal against the backdrop of an explicit pragmatism, and holds that animal property rights theory has the potential to reconcile animal and environmental ethics.|$|E

The Union artillery, aware that Confederates occupied the batteries and Fort Stedman, launched punishing fire against them. By 7:45a.m., 4,000 Union troops under Hartranft were positioned in a semicircle of a mile and a half, and counterattacked, causing heavy casualties to the now-retreating Confederates.|$|E

After Sanderson died, he was replaced by Captain Kincaid-Smith, who became general manager in 1931. Kincaid-Smith was able to acquire large quantities of tenants’ tobacco, as 150 pounds (about 70 kilograms) of dark-fired leaf was required <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>their</b> annual rent; he also bought amounts in excess of rents in kind, deferring payment until the tobacco was sold. The value of this tobacco was well {{in excess of the}} cash rent, and in theory, tenants could only sell to the Bruce Estates, but some tobacco was sold at a better price elsewhere by claiming it was smallholder produced. Curing tobacco required large amounts of firewood, and by 1945 the estate was severely deforested.|$|E
25|$|CBS alienated and {{confused}} fans with its sporadic treatment of regular season telecasts. With {{a sense of}} true continuity destroyed, fans eventually figured {{that they could not}} count on the network <b>to</b> <b>satisfy</b> <b>their</b> needs (thus, poor ratings were a result). CBS televised about 16 regular season Saturday afternoon games (not counting back-up telecasts) which was 14 less than what NBC televised during the previous contract. According to Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, the reason for the reduction in regular season telecasts was in order for teams to sell them locally {{in order to make a}} direct profit. CBS used the strategy of broadcasting only a select amount of games in order to build a demand in response to supposedly sagging ratings. In theory, the limited regular season package would require the network to sell less advertising during the year so it can charge more for its postseason events.|$|E

Already in 1572, John III had requested that Archibald Ruthven recruit Scottish co-patriots to reinforce his Livonian army. Ruthven had raised 3,000 infantry and 760 cavalry, {{who arrived in}} Swedish Älvsborg in June and July 1573. They were split up into small units and marched to Sweden's eastern coast. Overdue pay caused some mercenaries to delay their march, pillage the countryside, and revolt against Ruthven. Upon their arrival in Stockholm and ports in Östergötland, {{they were joined by}} another 300 Scottish cavalry and shipped to Reval, where they arrived in September and joined with Swedish and Finnish regulars as well as German mercenaries, primarily consisting of cavalry and artillery. In November, the army left for Wesenberg, under the overall command of Klas Åkesson Tott (the Elder) and field command of Pontus de la Gardie.
