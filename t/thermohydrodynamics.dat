40|$|In this paper, the <b>thermohydrodynamics</b> of an {{evaporating}} droplet is {{investigated by}} using a single-component pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann model. The phase change {{is applied to the}} model by adding source terms to the thermal lattice Boltzmann equation {{in such a way that}} the macroscopic energy equation of multiphase flows is recovered. In order to gain an exhaustive understanding of the complex hydrodynamics during evaporation, a single droplet is selected as a case study. At first, some tests for a stationary (non-) evaporating droplet are carried out to validate the method. Then the model is used to study the <b>thermohydrodynamics</b> of a falling evaporating droplet. The results show that the model is capable of reproducing the flow dynamics and transport phenomena of a stationary evaporating droplet quite well. Of course, a moving droplet evaporates faster than a stationary one due to the convective transport. Our study shows that our single-component model for simulating a moving evaporating droplet is limited to low Reynolds numbers. </p...|$|E

The model acronym is FAST, which stands for Friction Algorithm using Speed Skate <b>Thermohydrodynamics.</b> Mutatis mutandis, it is applicable to other ice friction problems in the hydrodynamic friction regime. The paper updates and corrects an earlier publication of the model (FAST 1. 0) that omitted the full derivation of the lubrication equation. It also presents a more thorough exploration of the model results and its sensitivity to the variation of physical variables.

A critical temperature gradient arises {{on the basis of}} the He II two-fluid model at the stability limit constraining the <b>thermohydrodynamics</b> of the system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} an accurate, yet economical, method for computing temperature effects in laminar lubricating films in two dimensions. Because of the marked dependence of lubricant viscosity on temperature, the effect of viscosity variation both across and along a lubricating film can dwarf other deviations from ideal constant-property lubrication. In practice, a <b>thermohydrodynamics</b> program will involve simultaneous solution of the film lubrication problem, together with heat conduction in a solid, complex structure. In pursuit of computational economy, techniques similar to those for Gaussian quadrature are used; it is shown that, for many purposes, the use of just two properly positioned temperatures (Lobatto points) characterizes the transverse temperature distribution...|$|E

40|$|A {{theory of}} <b>thermohydrodynamics</b> in {{two-dimensional}} electron systems in quantizing magnetic fields is developed including a nonlinear transport regime. Spatio-temporal {{variations of the}} electron temperature and the chemical potential in the local equilibrium are described by the equations of conservation with the number and thermal-energy flux densities. A model of these flux densities due to hopping and drift processes is introduced for a random potential varying slowly compared to both the magnetic length and the phase coherence length. The flux measured in the standard transport experiment is derived and is used to define a transport component of the flux density. The equations of conservation can be written {{in terms of the}} transport component only. As an illustration, the theory is applied to the Ettingshausen effect, in which a one-dimensional spatial variation of the electron temperature is produced perpendicular to the current.

40|$|Generalized <b>thermohydrodynamics</b> is used {{to provide}} for a basis to compute {{transport}} coefficients of a binary isothermal solution consisting of a viscoelastic fluid in a viscous solvent. A description is made of the states of this system using, besides the conventional conserved densities, a set of non-conserved variables provided by the stress tensor and the mass flux {{of one of the}} components. Within a linearized scheme, the solution to the evolution equations obeyed by the latter ones provides a set of constitutive equations which are in general both wave vector and frequency dependent. When the constitutive equations are substituted into the conservation equations, a complete set is obtained from which all relevant quantities may be computed. These involve wave vector and frequency dependent expressions for the transport coefficients as well as the dynamic structure factor which may be obtained by light or neutron scattering. These results are analyzed and compared with other ones existing in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Fig. 2. Microsegregation {{behavior}} in silicon pulled under the presently reported thermal configuration. Note the abrupt transi-tion from forced convection controlled segregation (top portion) to thermal convection controlled segregation (bottom portion) which occurred as the melt level was decreased and the aspect ratio exceeded {{the value of}} 2. 5. were introduced by interface demarcation, employing current pulses of 10 A /cm 2 at 1 sec intervals. These rate striations show clearly the existence of pronounced thermal asymmetry and the occurrence of periodic rotational backmelt ing during growth. With the given thermal configuration, growth without convective in-terference was reproducibly achieved for aspect ratios (d/h) of the melt less than 2. 5. For the crucible em-ployed (5 cm in diameter), these aspect ratios corre-spond to melt heights greater than 2. 1 cm. As the mel t height decreased below 2. 1 cm, {{it was found that}} the growth system changes abrupt ly to the normal ly en-countered conditions associated with turbulent con-vection control led growth and segregation. The critical aspect ratio (2. 5) was found to be independent of the pull ing rate and of the diameter of the crystal grown. The segregation behavior above and below the critical aspect ratio is shown in Fig. 2. It is of interest to note that temperature measure-ments in the melt, with a thermocouple located 0. 5 cm below the init ial growth interface, indicated the pres-ence of pronounced i r regular temperature fluctuations (up to _ 8 ~ of frequencies up to 5 Hz during growth both above and below the critical aspect ratio. In the light of the observed growth and segregation, the de-tai led study of the thermal configuration and the pre-vail ing <b>thermohydrodynamics</b> of the melt should be of fundamental significance. The reported thermal asymmetry effect on micro-segregation in silicon now makes it possible to isolate forced convection from thermal convection effects and to investigate quantitat ively their respective influence on growth and segregation.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Most modern engines utilise pistons with an offset gudgeon pin. In internal combustion engines, the offset is to the major thrust side of the piston. The piston thrust side {{is the part of}} the piston perpendicular to the gudgeon pin that carries the majority of side loading during the power stroke. Primary reason for having the gudgeon pin positioned eccentrically is to prevent the piston from slamming into the cylinder bore after the connecting rod journal passes the top dead centre. This phenomenon is referred to as piston slap, and is more pronounced in compression ignition and high performance engines due to higher combustion pressure than that of commercial spark ignition engines. The coming together of the piston and the bore results in scuffing, at best, or, catastrophic failure at worst. Clearance space between bore and piston is filled by a lubricant film. The main role of the lubricant is to separate the piston and bore by reacting to the applied load. Investigating the above problem requires a holistic approach, whereby a dynamic three degree-of-freedom piston model is coupled with a lubrication model to represent the actual system. The dynamic model determines the motion of the piston in combined axial, lateral and rotation about the gudgeon pin. The reactive forces due to lubricant films on the major and minor thrust sides of the piston play significant roles in piston dynamics and are evaluated by either quasi-static or transient solution of the lubricant contact conjunctions. The novel quasi-static analysis is carried out in the sense of its detailed approach, including many key practical features. not incorporated in other analyses, hitherto reported in literature. These features include first and foremost the development of a specific contact mechanics model for evaluation of conforming contacts for piston skirt against liner or bore. The quasi-static analysis includes many practical feature not encountered in other literature on the subject, such as detailed surface irregularities and modification features, and with thermal distortion. The analysis has been extended to <b>thermohydrodynamics,</b> as well as micro-hydrodynamics, all with high computational mesh densities, and robust methods of solution in space and time domains, including effective influence Newton-Raphson method and linear acceleration integration scheme. The transient tribo-elasto-multi-body dynamics problem includes physics of motion study from film thickness prediction and secondary motion evaluation of the order of micrometers and minutes of arc to large rigid body dynamics, including simultaneous solution of the contact problem at both major and minor thrust sides. Such a comprehensive solution has not hitherto been reported in literature. The thesis discusses many aspects of piston dynamics problem, through the broad spectrum of vehicle manufacture, with many pertinent practical engineering issues. In particular, it provides solutions for high performance Formula 1 racing engines. This is the first ever comprehensive analysis of piston tribodynamics for this range of engines at very high combustion pressures. This study has shown the paramount influence of profile of piston in promoting lubrication between the contiguous bodies, as evident from the pattern of lubricant flow through the contact. Deformation of the bodies increases the volume of lubricant in the contact. During the reversal in direction of piston motion, when the entraining velocity momentarily cases and reversal takes place, the load is held by an elastic squeez...|$|E
