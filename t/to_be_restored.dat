Uhura and Pavel Chekov are tasked to find a nuclear reactor, whose energy leakage will enable their ship's power <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>restored.</b>|$|E
5|$|Breathitt was {{a member}} of National Governors Conference Executive Committee in 1964 and 1965 and chaired its Natural Resources Committee. In the 1966 legislature, he won {{approval}} for several conservation measures, including the creation of an authority to regulate water, soil, and forest resources. The session also tightened strip mining laws to prohibit mining on mountainsides that were too steep <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>restored.</b> In 1967, he was recognized with the U.S. Department of Interior's Distinguished Service Award and Outdoor Life magazine's Conservationist of the Year Award for his contributions to conservation.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Congress {{repealed}} termination {{and restored}} federal {{recognition of the}} Menominee tribe. The Menominee Restoration Act was signed by Richard Nixon; it repealed the Menominee Indian Termination Act, reopened the tribal rolls, re-established the trust status and provided for the reformation of tribal government. The tribe was the first terminated tribe <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> to trust and recognition status. The Restoration Act signaled {{the end of the}} termination era.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the riot}} {{appeared}} to increase {{public support for}} radical reform of the present degrading prison system. Some of that goodwill will have been eroded by the antics of the rioters {{in the last two}} weeks, and may be further eroded once details emerge during the forthcoming criminal prosecutions. But this must not deflect Home Office ministers from the road down which they had belatedly begun to travel. A change in prison conditions is crucial if good order is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> to the system.|$|E
5|$|The {{citizens}} left homeless by Omar {{resided in}} a tent city nicknamed Camp Omar, consisting of 200tents holding more than 1,000people. Volunteers and military efforts cleaned most of the debris on the island within a few weeks. Many important roads were reopened by {{three days after the}} storm. The power took four weeks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> island-wide, disrupting schools and businesses, although water access was expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> within a few days of the storm. Schools reopened on September 14, and most businesses resumed their work {{by the end of the}} month. The United States military ceased relief operations on September 19, though complete recovery was disrupted by the passage of several subsequent typhoons. These storms caused less damage than normal after Omar wrecked the more vulnerable structures. As a result, it became difficult to discern the damage between Omar and Typhoon Gay in December 1992. A 1993 study in the medical journal Anxiety found that 7.2% of 320 participants affected by Omar developed acute stress reaction, and another 15% developed early traumatic stress response, especially those affected by the later typhoons. About 5.9% of the participants displayed symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, similar to the levels shown after Hurricane Hugo in 1989.|$|E
5|$|After John's loss of Normandy, Maulay went to England and {{was given}} the manor of Upavon in Wiltshire. His grant of the manor was at the king's pleasure, because the manor, which had been held by a noble who {{forfeited}} his land in England by staying in Normandy after its loss, would need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> to its rightful holder if John recovered Normandy. He served as an envoy to Rome in 1213 and in 1214 was in command of royal forces at La Rochelle in France. In 1214 he married Isabella, the daughter and heiress of Robert of Thornham. Robert had died in 1211, so through his wife, Maulay acquired the Barony of Mulgrave in Yorkshire. Maulay paid the king 7000 marks as a fine {{for the right to}} marry Isabella, one of the highest fines paid for the right to marry under John. According to the medieval chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall, Maulay was the murderer of John's nephew Arthur of Brittany.|$|E

5|$|Almost all of Manila's prewar and Spanish colonial {{architecture}} {{were destroyed}} during its battle for liberation by the intensive bombardment of the United States Air Force during World War II. Reconstruction took place afterwards, replacing the destroyed historic Spanish-era buildings with modern ones, erasing {{much of the}} city's character. Some buildings destroyed by the war have been reconstructed, such as the Old Legislative Building (now the National Museum of Fine Arts), Ayuntamiento de Manila (now the Bureau of the Treasury) and the currently under construction San Ignacio Church and Convent (as the Museo de Intramuros). There are plans to rehabilitate and/or restore several neglected historic buildings and places such as Plaza Del Carmen, San Sebastian Church and the Manila Metropolitan Theater. Spanish-era shops and houses in the districts of Binondo, Quiapo, and San Nicolas are also planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>restored,</b> {{as a part of}} a movement to restore the city to its former glory and its beautiful prewar state.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} end, at Ysgwrfa, the final five locks before Glynneath have been severed by a realignment {{of the road}} and the construction of a culvert, but the road has carried a lot less traffic since the A465 bypass was opened, and could possibly be rerouted along its original course, where the bridge over the canal still exists. The Neath Canal Act has not been repealed, and so there is still a right of navigation along this section, which should ease the process of reinstating it. The terminus would then be near the Lamb and Flag public house, south of the final two locks, which are unlikely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>restored.</b>|$|E
5|$|Colder weather, {{bringing}} with it rain and snow on September 11 calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though the fires continued to burn {{well into the}} middle of November, they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued to arrive at Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had been affected by the firefighting efforts. Hundreds of miles of firelines, helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> to a more natural state, and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings. Finally, on November 18, all fires in Yellowstone were officially declared out.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Geneva Accord {{requiring}} {{an immediate}} withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the JNA stayed behind {{for up to}} eight months in some areas. When its troops eventually pulled out, JNA left their equipment to the RSK. As a consequence of organisational problems and breaches of ceasefire, the UN peacekeepers, named the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), did not start to deploy until 8 March. The UNPROFOR took two months to fully assemble in the UN Protected Areas (UNPAs). Furthermore, the RSK forces remained in areas outside designated UNPAs which were under RSK control {{at the time of}} the signing of the Implementation Agreement ceasefire of 3 January 1992. Those areas, later better known as the pink zones, were supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> to Croatian control from the outset of the plan implementation. Failure of this aspect of the implementation of the Vance plan made the pink zones a major source of contention for Croatia and the RSK.|$|E
5|$|Following {{months of}} rumours, in October 2013 a BBC press conference {{announced}} {{the return of}} 11 episodes (two of which previously existing) from a television relay station {{in the city of}} Jos, Nigeria. In the course of his work abroad, Philip Morris of Television International Enterprises Archives had discovered episodes 1-6 of The Enemy of the World and episodes 1-6 of The Web of Fear. and returned 11 of these to the BBC. The return of the nine missing episodes was the single largest recovery of Doctor Who episodes in 25 years, resulting in only the second full serial from Troughton's first two seasons <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> to the BBC.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey quarrelled with Richard in 1196 in Normandy {{while the}} {{archbishop}} {{was attempting to}} return to England. Richard forbade him from administering York, and Geoffrey returned to Rome until 1198. An attempt at reconciliation with Richard came to nothing, after Geoffrey refused to approve the king's appointments in the diocese of York without some guarantees {{that they would be}} approved by the papacy. Ultimately Pope Innocent III on 28April 1199 ordered that Geoffrey was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> to his lands as soon as he had paid his debts to the king. Innocent further ordered that any royal appointments in York would require papal approval.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{telephone}} service onto {{the island was}} disrupted, and the only method of outside contact was by radio to the University of Guam. The Guam Memorial Hospital dropped a package of medical supplies to Yap, although planes containing aid flying onto the island were disrupted by the damaged runway. About a day after Sudal's passage, the runway was cleared and repaired, which allowed a United States Coast Guard plane to provide relief supplies, including building materials. By April12, or {{three days after the}} typhoon, communication links to the island began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>restored.</b> By four days later, the water treatment plant was repaired. One power station on the island was repaired, but since the strong winds damaged most of the power lines, about 85% of the population remained without electricity. Primary roadways were largely cleared, and all bridges were reopened.|$|E
5|$|Louis XVIII {{admitted}} the Count of Artois and his nephews the Dukes of Angoulême and Berry into the king's council in May 1814, upon its establishment. The council was informally headed by Prince Talleyrand. Louis XVIII took a large {{interest in the}} goings-on of the Congress of Vienna (set up to redraw the map of Europe after Napoleon's demise). Talleyrand represented France at the proceedings. Louis was horrified by Prussia's intention to annex the Kingdom of Saxony, {{to which he was}} attached because his mother was born a Saxon princess, and he was also concerned that Prussia would dominate Germany. He also wished the Duchy of Parma <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> to the Parmese Bourbons, and not to Empress Marie Louise of France, as was being suggested by the Allies. Louis also protested the Allies' inaction in Naples, where he wanted the Napoleonic usurper Joachim Murat removed in favour of the Neapolitan Bourbons.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III {{attempted}} {{to lead a}} rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans {{on the condition that}} they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice (perhaps by order of Alexander) of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian troops, yet in 330BC, Alexander declared that the tyrannies installed in Greece were to be abolished and Greek freedom was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>restored.</b>|$|E
