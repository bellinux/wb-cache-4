5|$|The temple is D-shaped, and its {{alignment}} is 10.7 degrees off true east-west. Its {{location and}} orientation indicate that its builders understood {{the cycles of}} both {{the sun and the}} moon. It is aligned to the major lunar standstill, which occurs once every 18.6 years, and the sunset during <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>solstice,</b> which can be viewed setting over the temple from a platform {{at the south end of}} Cliff Palace, across Fewkes Canyon. At the bottom of the canyon is the Sun Temple fire pit, which is illuminated by the first rays of the rising sun during <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>solstice.</b> Sun Temple is one of the largest exclusively ceremonial structures ever built by the Ancestral Puebloans.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{northern}} latitude, the number of daylight hours varies considerably between summer and winter. On the summer solstice, the sun rises at 04:26 and sets at 21:58, providing 17 hours 32 minutes of daylight. On <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>solstice,</b> it rises at 08:37 and sets at 15:39 with 7 hours and 2 minutes of daylight. The difference in the length of days and nights between the summer and winter solstices is 10 hours and 30 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the year {{different}} sections of the rod serve as the style, which is the part of the gnomon that indicates the time by casting its shadow on the dial face. At the summer solstice, when the Sun is highest (farthest above the equatorial plane), the style is closest to the top of the rod, and at <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>solstice,</b> when the Sun is lowest, it is closest to the bottom. At the equinoxes, when the Sun is on the equatorial plane, the style is exactly in the center of the length of the rod. The style of the equatorial sundial is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they did}} not fix their {{schedules}} to the clock in the modern sense, ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more flexibly than DST does, often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of daytime, so that each daylight hour was longer during summer. For example, the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year: at Rome's latitude the third hour from sunrise, hora tertia, started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>solstice,</b> but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes. After ancient times, equal-length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal, so civil time no longer varies by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as some monasteries of Mount Athos and all Jewish ceremonies.|$|E

Thalia is also asked by Artemis to become an immortal Huntress, and her acceptance {{is the only thing that}} prevents the onset of the Great Prophecy. Percy is told by his father that Luke is somehow not dead, and he and Annabeth return to Camp Half-Blood worried about the future. Before he can relax, however, Percy is forced to explain Bianca's death to Nico. Nico blames Percy, and when a group of spartoi arrive to attack the son of Poseidon, Nico banishes them to the realm of Hades, and Percy realizes that he must be a son of Hades. Nico runs away, and the only people Percy tells the truth are Annabeth and Grover. They promise to hide this fact from everyone else, especially the Titan's army.|$|E
5|$|The {{equatorial}} ring {{goes around}} {{the belly of the}} armillary sphere 91 and 5/19 (degrees) away from the pole. The circle of the ecliptic also goes round the belly of the instrument at an angle of 24 (degrees) with the equator. Thus at the summer solstice the ecliptic is 67 (degrees) and a fraction away from the pole, while at <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>solstice</b> it is 115 (degrees) and a fraction away. Hence (the points) where the ecliptic and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But now (it has been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (degrees) away from the pole, and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (degrees) away. The former figure is adopted only because it agrees with the (results obtained by the) method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the Xia (dynasty) calendar.|$|E
5|$|There {{were many}} notable {{improvements}} to Chinese mathematics during the Song era. Mathematician Yang Hui's 1261 book provided the earliest Chinese illustration of Pascal's triangle, {{although it had}} earlier been described by Jia Xian in around 1100. Yang Hui also provided rules for constructing combinatorial arrangements in magic squares, provided theoretical proof for Euclid's forty-third proposition about parallelograms, {{and was the first}} to use negative coefficients of 'x' in quadratic equations. Yang's contemporary Qin Jiushao (c. 1202–1261) was the first to introduce the zero symbol into Chinese mathematics; before this blank spaces were used instead of zeroes in the system of counting rods. He is also known for working with the Chinese remainder theorem, Heron's formula, and astronomical data used in determining <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>solstice.</b> Qin's major work was the Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections published in 1247.|$|E

5|$|More {{problematic}} {{are those}} {{cases where the}} movement of the Sun at different times and seasons causes light and shadow interactions with petroglyphs. A widely known example is the Sun Dagger of Fajada Butte at which a glint of sunlight passes over a spiral petroglyph. The location of a dagger of light on the petroglyph varies throughout the year. At the summer solstice a dagger can be seen through the heart of the spiral; at <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>solstice</b> two daggers appear to either side of it. It is proposed that this petroglyph was created to mark these events. Recent studies have identified many similar sites in the US Southwest and Northwestern Mexico. It has been argued that the number of solstitial markers at these sites provides statistical evidence that they were intended to mark the solstices. The Sun Dagger site on Fajada Butte in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, stands out for its explicit light markings that record all the key events of both the solar and lunar cycles: summer solstice, winter solstice, equinox, and the major and minor lunar standstills of the moon’s 18.6 year cycle. In addition at two other sites on Fajada Butte, there are five light markings on petroglyphs recording the summer and winter solstices, equinox and solar noon. Numerous buildings and interbuilding alignments of the great houses of Chaco Canyon and outlying areas are oriented to the same solar and lunar directions that are marked at the Sun Dagger site.|$|E

25|$|December 21: Yule, {{a festival}} {{consisting}} of the 12 days after <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>solstice,</b> {{and the most important}} event for Odinism.

25|$|In most {{forms of}} Wicca, this holiday is celebrated at <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>{{solstice}}</b> as {{the rebirth of}} the Great horned hunter god, who is viewed as the newborn solstice sun.

25|$|Carved Stone Balls {{found at}} various sites in Scotland, {{northern}} England and north eastern Ireland. Spirals and rings of concentric circles carved {{on the balls}} {{can be found on}} standing stones and megalithic structures of the same period. Sites such as Maughanby Circle and Newgrange were designed to monitor the movements of the sun with special emphasis on <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>solstice.</b> The connection with megalithic art infers these carved stone balls had significant cultural importance to the pre-Celtic people who made them. They thought in a symbolic way and displayed ceremonial behaviour we may look upon today as religious. No written records exist for the Neolithic people of Britain and Ireland. From reading the archaeology it has not been possible to determine whether these peoples understood the concept of a ball game. However, as playing ball games feature in later religious festivities including Christmastide which coincides with Yuletide, <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>solstice</b> and the Pagan rebirth of the sun the possibility cannot be ruled out.|$|E
50|$|Scientifically, {{currently}} in <b>the</b> Northern Hemisphere, <b>winter</b> <b>solstice</b> occurs between 21 and 22 December. Day light {{will begin to}} increase on 22 December and on this day, the Sun will begin its northward journey which marks Uttarayaan. <b>The</b> date of <b>winter</b> <b>solstice</b> changes gradually due to the Axial precession of the Earth, coming earlier by approximately 1 day in every 70 years. Hence, if the Maghe Sankranti at some point of time did mark {{the day after the}} actual date of <b>winter</b> <b>solstice,</b> a date in mid-January would correspond to around 300CE, the heyday of English mathematics and astronomy.|$|R

5|$|By astronomical convention, {{the four}} seasons can be {{determined}} by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the equinoxes, when the direction of the tilt and the direction to the Sun are perpendicular. In <b>the</b> Northern Hemisphere, <b>winter</b> <b>solstice</b> currently occurs around 21 December; summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with <b>the</b> summer and <b>winter</b> <b>solstices</b> exchanged and <b>the</b> spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.|$|R

25|$|The pre-Christian holiday of Yule, or jól, was {{the most}} {{important}} holiday in Scandinavia and Northern Europe. Originally the observance of <b>the</b> <b>winter</b> <b>solstice,</b> and the rebirth of the sun, it brought about many practices that remain in the Advent and Christmas celebrations today. The Yule season was a time for feasting, drinking, gift-giving, and gatherings, but also the season of awareness and fear of the forces of the dark.|$|E
25|$|The werewolves {{were known}} to exterminate all kind of farm animals, {{especially}} sheep. The transformation usually occurred in <b>the</b> <b>Winter</b> <b>solstice,</b> Easter and full moon. Later in the 17th and 18th century, the trials in Hungary not only were conducted against witches, but against werewolves too, and many records exist creating connections between both kinds. Also the vampires and werewolves are closely related in Hungary, being both feared in the antiquity.|$|E
40|$|We use {{global climate}} {{simulations}} across one precessional cycle {{to investigate the}} effect of orbitally induced climatic changes on sedimentation in the Western Interior Seaway (WIS) of North America at the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary. The simulations include a control run with no orbital eccentricity and hence no precession cycle, and four runs with varying precession with an eccentricity of 0. 05 having (1) northern spring equinox at perihelion, (2) northern <b>winter</b> <b>solstice</b> at perihelion, (3) northern fall equinox at perihelion, and (4) northern summer solstice at perihelion. These numeric climate simulations and field observations suggest that the WIS at the Cenomanian/Turonian boundary {{can be divided into}} three latitudinal units: (1) A northern unit (Alberta–Montana) between 51 °N and 71 °N paleolatitude where conditions remained constant under the influence of steady inflow of low salinity, cool waters which were devoid of calcareous plankton flowed in from the Arctic, preventing the development of bedding couplets. (2) A central unit (Wyoming–Colorado) between 41 °N and 51 °N paleolatitude where runoff from Western North America (WNA) was reduced by more than half when <b>the</b> northern hemisphere <b>winter</b> <b>solstice</b> coincided with perihelion, where bedding couplets are well developed. The central part of the WIS was characterized by warm saline waters with abundant calcareous plankton. However it experienced high summer surface runoff from the Sevier Highlands to the west during all orbital configurations except when <b>the</b> <b>winters</b> were unusually warm, with <b>the</b> northern hemisphere <b>winter</b> <b>solstice</b> occurring at perihelion. Seasonal dilution of the surface waters of the seaway may have resulted in formation of a “fresh water lid” with stratification of the water column throughout most of the precession cycle. When <b>the</b> northern hemisphere <b>winter</b> <b>solstice</b> was at perihelion, reduced runoff would promote vertical mixing. Concomitantly, a steady detrital sediment supply would occur in summer throughout the precession cycle except when <b>the</b> NH <b>winter</b> <b>solstice</b> was at perihelion, when it would be much reduced. Thus the marlstone of the limestone–marlstone couplets would represent most of the time of the precession cycle and the limestone layers would represent the time when <b>the</b> NH <b>winter</b> <b>solstice</b> was near perihelion. (3) A southern region (New Mexico–northern Mexico) from 21 ° to 42 °N paleolatitude where the detrital sediment supply was much reduced and couplets are thicker and less well developed...|$|R
