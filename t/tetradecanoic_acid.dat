40|$|The {{clay mineral}} {{kaolinite}} {{is one of}} the major inorganic constituents of sedimentary rocks. Kaolinite-carboxylic acid interactions are of considerable importance from the geochemical perspective. The two-fold aim of this study was to quantify the adsorption of <b>tetradecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> on kaolinite and then the flash pyrolysis of adsorbed fatty acids-kaolinite samples to understand the transformation of adsorbed fatty acids on kaolinite. Adsorption of <b>tetradecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> on kaolinite results in an s-isotherm which reflects the multilayer adsorption. Adsorption of <b>tetradecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> on kaolinite involves its both functionalities i. e. siloxane (tetrahedral face) and hydroxyl surface (octahedral face) as indicated from the pyrolysis results. Flash pyrolysis of <b>tetradecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> adsorbed kaolinite mainly yielded saturated/unsaturated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, and ketones while pure <b>tetradecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> generated saturated/unsaturated hydrocarbons and a series of unsaturated and saturated low molecular weight fatty acids. We have successively tested an empirical approach to identify organic compounds formed from fatty acid adsorbed kaolinite to the organic compounds obtained from fatty acid adsorbed alumina and silica. Kaolinite mainly reflects the transformation of carboxylic acids into hydrocarbons and ketones via hydroxyl surface (octahedral face). Ketonisation is mainly observed at multilayer adsorption of <b>tetradecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> on kaolinite.

Based on the results obtained from sensory and RP-HPLC analysis, the optimal combinations {{to prepare a}} good quality of EMC were found to be: NeutraseRTM with (I) L. casei enzymes (aminopeptidase activity 86. 4 LAPU/g and esterase activity 110. 0 U/g), (II) Debitrase(TM) (aminopeptidase activity 22. 0 LAPU/g), (III) Flavorzyme(TM) (aminopeptidase activity 6. 5 LAPU/g), and (IV) PalataseRTM M (lipase activity 200 LU/g). The water-soluble fractions of EMCs prepared with different enzyme combinations were subjected to RP-HPLC on a Delta Pack C 18 column, and selected peaks were purified on the same column using a binary gradient. One peak from NeutraseRTM digest, five peaks from NeutraseRTM /Debitrase(TM) digest, and two peaks from NeutraseRTM /L. casei enzyme digest were purified and identified by API mass spectrometry. All the purified peptides contained active sites within their sequences. The volatile compounds {{in a series of}} EMCs prepared by L. casei and commercial enzymes as well as Cheddar cheese (mild, old, extra old) were also identified by using Pyrolysis/GC/MS and dynamic headspace techniques.

Following {{death of an}} organism in the marine environment its fatty acids may survive descent to the sea bed {{where they can be}} juxtaposed with minerals. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the interaction of fatty acids with the common marine mineral calcite. Adsorption of <b>tetradecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 14) on calcite results in a sigmoidal or “s” isotherm. Flash pyrolysis experiments were conducted on samples of fatty acid adsorbed onto calcite and were compared with similar experiments on pure fatty acid and on salts of a fatty acid. Flash pyrolysis of pure <b>tetradecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> generated unsaturated and saturated hydrocarbons and a series of unsaturated and saturated low molecular weight fatty acids. Flash pyrolysis of free <b>tetradecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> salt produced saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, an aldehyde and a homologous series of saturated and unsaturated ketones, one of which was a symmetrical mid chain ketone (14 -heptacosanone). Flash pyrolysis data from adsorbed <b>tetradecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> samples suggested that adsorption is analogous to the formation of the calcium salt of <b>tetradecanoic</b> <b>acid.</b> A key characteristic of the flash pyrolysis products of adsorbed fatty acids and fatty acid salts was the production of ketones with higher molecular weights than the starting fatty acids. Ketonisation was not observed from the flash pyrolysis of pure acid which implied the catalytic significance of the calcite mineral surface. The abundance of hydrocarbons relative to ketones in the pyrolysates negatively correlated with the proportion of fatty acids adsorbed to the surface of calcite. The ability to use flash pyrolysis to diagnose the nature of fatty acid interactions with mineral surfaces provides a valuable tool for monitoring the fate of these important lipids at the Earth’s surface as they pass into the geosphere and are subjected to diagenetic processes...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{aliphatic}} carboxylic {{acids in}} host-seeking {{response of the}} malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto was examined both in a dual-choice olfactometer and with indoor traps. A basic attractive blend of ammonia + lactic acid served as internal standard odor. Single carboxylic acids were tested in a tripartite blend with ammonia + lactic acid. Four different airflow stream rates (0. 5, 5, 50, and 100  ml/min) carrying the compounds were tested for their effect on trap entry response in the olfactometer. In the olfactometer, propanoic acid, butanoic acid, 3 -methylbutanoic acid, pentanoic acid, heptanoic acid, octanoic acid, and <b>tetradecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> increased attraction relative to the basic blend. While several carboxylic acids were attractive only at one or two flow rates, <b>tetradecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> was attractive at all flow rates tested. Heptanoic acid was attractive at the lowest flow rate (0. 5  ml/min), but repellent at 5 and 50  ml/min. Mixing the air stream laden with these 7 carboxylic acids together with the headspace of the basic blend increased attraction in two quantitative compositions. Subtraction of single acids from the most attractive blend revealed that 3 -methylbutanoic acid had {{a negative effect on}} trap entry response. In the absence of <b>tetradecanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> the blend was repellent. In assays with MM-X traps, both a blend of 7 carboxylic acids + ammonia + lactic acid (all applied from low density polyethylene-sachets) and a simple blend of ammonia + lactic acid + <b>tetradecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> were attractive.

40|$|Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel {{electrophoresis}} {{was used to}} analyze the macromolecular heterogeneity of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from seven fresh clinical isolates and three culture collection strains of the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori. All the clinical isolates produced smooth-form LPS with O side chains of relatively homogeneous chain length, whereas the culture collection strains yielded rough-form LPS. A better yield of the latter LPS was obtained when combined protease pretreatment and hot phenol-water extraction were used than when the conventional phenol-water technique alone was used for extraction. The LPS of the three culture collection strains (S- 24, C- 5437, and NCTC 11637) were chemically characterized. Constituents common to all the LPS were fucose, D-mannose, D-glucose, D-galactose, D-glycero-D-manno-heptose, L-glycero-D-manno-heptose, and 3 -deoxy-D-manno- 2 -octulosonic acid. The molar ratios of the hexoses differed between different strains, thereby reflecting structural differences. Phosphate, phosphorylethanolamine, and pyrophosphorylethanolamine were present also. Free lipid A contained D-glucosamine and fatty acids, with phosphate and a minor amount of ethanolamine. The major fatty acids were ester- and amide-bound 3 -hydroxyoctadecanoic acid and ester-bound octadecanioc and 3 -hydroxyhexadecanoic acids, with minor amounts of ester-bound <b>tetradecanoic</b> and hexadecanoic <b>acids.</b> In addition to the uncommonly long 3 -hydroxy fatty acids, an unusual phosphorylation pattern was deduced to be present in the lipid A...|$|R
40|$|The work {{described}} in this report was focused on generating increased knowledge of fingerprint chemistry, particularly the composition of a latent fingerprint {{at the time it}} is deposited, and the chemical changes in lipid components that occur over time. Fingerprints from five male donors (aged 25 - 34 years) were collected and aged under controlled conditions. The prints were then sampled at set intervals, solvent extracted with dichloromethane, co-derivatized with MSTFA and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). It was shown that there was loss of squalene from prints stored in the light or in the dark. Loss was more rapid in the light, with squalene in prints from some donors not detected after 9 days storage. For these same donors, squalene was still detected after 33 days storage in the dark, but at much lower levels than in fresh prints. For saturated fatty <b>acids</b> (<b>tetradecanoic,</b> palmitic and stearic acid) there was a trend towards an increase in levels of these substances during storage (up to about 20 days) followed by a decrease back to original levels or below. This was the case for samples stored in the light or in the dark. For palmitoleic acid, a similar trend was seen. For oleic acid, this trend was seen for samples stored in the dark. For samples stored in the light the general trend was a decrease in level over the storage period (up to 33 days). © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{biochemical}} {{response of}} the earthworm Lumbricus rubellus to pyrene exposure was assessed using 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and pattern recognition techniques. Both analytical methods enabled the establishment of reproducible metabolic profiles. NMR analysis identified a total of 32 metabolites while GC-MS identified 51. The results demonstrate {{that not only is}} pyrene toxic to L. rubellus, but that alterations in its normal metabolic profile could be observed even when individuals were exposed to concentrations of 40 mg kg- 1 : a pollution level that is both below the concentration previously found to significantly reduce reproduction and within the range of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) found on some contaminated sites. Pyrene was found to cause a dose dependant decrease in lactate and the concentrations of the saturated fatty <b>acids</b> <b>tetradecanoic,</b> hexadecanoic and octadecanoic acid and an increase in production of the amino acids alanine, leucine, valine, isoleucine, lysine, tyrosine and methionine. It is proposed that this indicates impaired glucose metabolism, with an associated increase in fatty acid metabolism and changes in TCA cycle intermediates. This study demonstrates the versatility of metabolomics as a tool to monitor toxicity in the environment as opposed to utilising model species studied in a laboratory setting. Since it is a non-carcinogenic PAH, we propose that the metabolic changes observed in worms may reflect the non-specific toxic effects of pyrene as a typical, non-polar organic compound...|$|R
