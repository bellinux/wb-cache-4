40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine {{different}} preferences for brand name–country of origin shaped in line with levels of conspicuous consumption tendency and to determine Turkish consumers’ preferences for brand name–country of origin combinations in different product groups. The study was conducted in Eskisehir (Turkey) with a sample of 413 people chosen through convenience sampling. The study data were collected with a questionnaire and face-face-to interviews. The participants’ preferences for brand name-country of origin combinations were determined separately based on four different product groups(hedonic, utilitarian, durable and non-durable). The study showed that, for all the four product groups, the participants preferred the products with a Turkish brand name and Turkey as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin most, followed by the products with a French brand name and France as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin. This finding suggests that, with respect to the four product groups in the study, Turkish consumers preferred domestic products over foreign products. Also, the participants who preferred French brand name-France as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin for <b>the</b> hedonic product, French brand name-Turkey as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin for <b>the</b> utilitarian product, French brand name-Turkey as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin for <b>the</b> durable product and French brand name-France as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin for <b>the</b> non-durable product were found to have highest tendency of conspicuous consumption in the corresponding product groups. In other words, as the level of conspicuous consumption increased, the participants tended to prefer French brand name-France as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin for <b>the</b> hedonic product, French brand name-Turkey as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin for <b>the</b> utilitarian product, French brand name-Turkey as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin for <b>the</b> durable product and French brand name-France as <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>of</b> origin for <b>the</b> non-durable product...|$|R

The American Red Cross quickly provided aid to the affected residents, using churches and public buildings to house homeless people. In the two weeks after the storm, Americans donated about $10million to the Red Cross. <b>The</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain, Netherlands, Australia, Canada, France, Austria, and Venezuela offered aid to help the flood victims, sending emergency supplies.

5|$|In late 1918, the British Labour Party {{called for}} the {{establishment}} of an international conference of socialist parties, the Labour and Socialist International. Lenin saw this as a revival of the Second International, which he had despised, and formulated his own rival international socialist conference to offset its impact. Organised with the aid of Zinoviev, Trotsky, Christian Rakovsky, and Angelica Balabanoff, the First Congress of this Communist International ("Comintern") opened in Moscow in March 1919. It lacked global coverage; of the 34 assembled delegates, 30 resided within <b>the</b> <b>countries</b> <b>of</b> the former Russian Empire, and most of the international delegates were not recognised by any socialist parties in their own nations. Accordingly, the Bolsheviks dominated proceedings, with Lenin subsequently authoring a series of regulations that meant that only socialist parties endorsing the Bolsheviks' views were permitted to join Comintern. During the first conference, Lenin spoke to the delegates, lambasting the parliamentary path to socialism espoused by revisionist Marxists like Kautsky and repeating his calls for a violent overthrow of Europe's bourgeoisie governments. While Zinoviev became Comintern's President, Lenin retained significant influence over it.|$|E
