25|$|Although the denarius {{remained}} {{the backbone of}} the Roman economy from its introduction in 211 BC until it ceased to be normally minted {{in the middle of the}} third century, the purity and weight of the coin slowly, but inexorably, decreased. The problem of debasement in the Roman economy appears to be pervasive, although the severity of the debasement often paralleled the strength or weakness of the Empire. While it is not clear why debasement was such a common occurrence for the Romans, it's believed that it was caused by several factors, including a lack of precious metals and inadequacies in state finances. When introduced, the denarius contained nearly pure silver at a <b>theoretical</b> <b>weight</b> of approximately 4.5 grams.|$|E
500|$|The gold solidi are all {{close to}} their <b>theoretical</b> <b>weight</b> of 4.48g ( [...] of a Roman pound). The {{fineness}} of a solidus in this period was 99% gold. The total weight of the solidi in the hoard is almost exactly 8 Roman pounds, suggesting that the coins had been measured out by weight rather than number. Analysis of the siliquae suggests a range of fineness of between 95% and 99% silver, with {{the highest percentage of}} silver found just after a reform of the coinage in 368. Of the siliquae, 428 are locally produced imitations, generally of high quality and with as much silver as the official siliquae of the period. However, a handful are cliché forgeries where a core of base metal has been wrapped in silver foil.|$|E
500|$|Endubis, {{the first}} known Aksumite king to mint coins, focused almost entirely on his image on both the obverse and reverse. The images were {{of his head and}} upper half of his chest in profile, wearing a regnal {{headcloth}} or helmet and abundant jewelry. [...] In addition to inscribing his regnal name, Endybis also noted his [...] "bisi name, a practice continued by his early successors, but often missing in later coins. The bisi name was a sort of tribal affiliation or [...] "ethnikon" [...] (i.e. a reference to the king's lineage) that was different for every king. Endybis also emphasized his religion through the pre-Christian symbol of the disk and crescent as a propaganda method (a purpose which the coins already served). A second motif used by Enybis and continued by following coins was that of two (though sometimes one in later years) ears of barley or wheat around the image of his head in profile. Though no inscriptional evidence exists, given its prominent position around the image of the king, the two ears of barley (or wheat) may have been representative symbols of the Aksumite state. Though later coins would be smaller, Endybis chose the Roman aureus to standardize Aksumite coin weights against, with gold issues at half-aureus around 2.70grams (more precisely, the <b>theoretical</b> <b>weight</b> may have been 2.725g).|$|E

The lack or uncertainties in recharge, impact of vadose zone, and hydraulic conductivity are the highest factors that reduce the efficiency of the vulnerability index model.|$|R
5|$|The {{quality of}} the Aksumite coins were also closely controlled, usually of high purity. For example, the lowest purity of gold {{recorded}} thus far for Aphilas is 90 percent. Early issues were often very close to their <b>theoretical</b> <b>weights,</b> and some were even over.) However, {{the weight of the}} coins tended to decrease over time (though not continuously or uniformly). This may have reflected a desire to conform to the Diocletian monetary reform of 301, when the aureus was decreased from 1/60 of a pound to 1/72. Despite decreases in weight, the purity of the gold was largely maintained, even by later kings. The relative abundance of Aksumite coins as well as the many that have yet to be found indicate that Aksum must have had access to large quantities of gold.|$|R

It {{remained}} at nearly this weight until the time of Nero (AD 37-68), when it was reduced to [...] of a pound, or 3.4grams. Debasement of the coin's silver content continued after Nero. Later Roman emperors reduced its content to 3grams around the late third century.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hull of the}} Hasholme Logboat {{was made}} out of an oak tree (Quercus sp.). After all the {{measurements}} of the hull were taken, {{it was estimated that}} the parent log (oak log the boat was made of) had to be approximately [...] long with at least [...] circumference. Thus the <b>theoretical</b> <b>weight</b> of this log must have been around 28.5 tons but {{because of the presence of}} “heart rot” (the natural process of rotting of the interior of the log) these estimates are exaggerated. Based on the size of the oak and other dendro measurements, it was suggested that this kind of tree was between 810 and 880 years old on felling. Oaks of such advanced age and size must have developed a rot known as “brittle heart,” which originates at the base and spreads upward. In the case of Hasholme, this rot spread almost to the very top of the trunk. This meant that even though the hollowing was much easier, the openings on both ends had to be closed and made watertight. It was no accident to select a tree with an extensive rot along its entire length and thus save a tremendous amount of time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Future {{reusable}} launch vehicles may be lifting {{bodies with}} non-circular cross section like the proposed Lockheed-Martin VentureStarª. Current {{designs for the}} cryogenic tanks of these vehicles are dual-lobed and quad-lobed tanks which are packaged more efficiently than circular tanks, but still have low packaging efficiencies with large gaps existing between the vehicle outer mold line and the outer surfaces of the tanks. In this study, tanks that conform to the outer mold line of a non-circular vehicle were investigated. Four structural concepts for conformal cryogenic tanks and a quad-lobed tank concept were optimized for minimum weight designs. The conformal tank concepts included a sandwich tank stiffened with axial tension webs, a sandwich tank stiffened with transverse tension webs, a sandwich tank stiffened with rings and tension ties, and a sandwich tank stiffened with orthogrid stiffeners and tension ties. For each concept, geometric parameters (such as ring frame spacing, the number and spacing of tension ties or webs, and tank corner radius) and internal pressure loads were varied and the structure was optimized using a finite-element-based optimization procedure. <b>Theoretical</b> volumetric <b>weights</b> were calculated by dividing {{the weight of the}} barrel section of the tank concept and its associated frames, webs and tension ties by the volume it circumscribes.

50|$|Dimensional {{weight is}} a {{calculation}} of a <b>theoretical</b> <b>weight</b> of a package. This <b>theoretical</b> <b>weight</b> is {{the weight of}} the package at a minimum density chosen by the freight carrier. If the package is below this minimum density, then the actual weight is irrelevant as the freight carrier will charge for the volume of the package as if it were of the chosen density (what the package would weigh at the minimum density). Furthermore, the volume used to calculate the dimensional weight may not be absolutely representative of the true volume of the package. The freight carrier will measure the longest dimension {{in each of the three}} axis (X, Y, Z) and use these measurements to determine the package volume. If the package is a right-angled rectangular box (cuboid), then this will be equal to the true volume of the package. However, if the package is of any other shape, then the calculation of volume will be more than the true volume of the package.|$|E

In this paper, DRASTIC assessment was modified and applied, {{for the first}} time, to address the intrinsic vulnerability for karst aquifers.

Some of his gold Christian coins are of the weight before Constantine I's weight reform in 324, indicating a conversion before this date or perhaps a few years after, as the Aksumite coinage may not have changed weights immediately. Along with the adoption of the Cross on his coins came, of course, the abandonment of the star and crescent symbol on the coins.
