25|$|People's Republic of China, {{though not}} a G7 industralised nations member, is {{expected}} to loom large, with the minister and central bankers to press Beijing to further ease controls of the Renminbi. The agenda of the meeting is about what {{will be seen as}} dangerous imbalances in the global economy. The United States has run up massive accounts and budget deficits, export-led surpluses are developing in Asia. It also marks the debut to the G7 meetings, that is United States Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who was formerly the {{chairman and chief executive officer}} of Goldman Sachs. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> the fight against terrorism and nuclear proliferation to be included on the agenda. The Program of Seminars opens on this day and runs for two days. The G24 ministers meeting will be held at SSICEC as well as the Program of Seminars.|$|E
2500|$|It's {{pretty hard}} {{to say on the}} one hand that we feel very {{strongly}} about Pakistani and Indian nuclear testing {{and on the other hand}} the U.S. Senate won't ratify the ...treaty... The last thing <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> to see is a resumption of nuclear testing or the proliferation of nuclear weapons – and it is the last thing Australia wants to see. By refusing to ratify this treaty, the United States Senate has done a lot to undermine the arms control agenda that the international community, including Australia, has been working on.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> New Zealand {{to repeal}} its nuclear-free legislation, {{which would then}} allow U.S. {{warships}} carrying nuclear weapons to visit New Zealand ports. Pressure from the United States increased in 2006, with U.S. trade officials linking {{the repeal of the}} ban of American nuclear ships from New Zealand's ports to a potential free-trade agreement between the two countries. In 2004, then opposition leader Don Brash refused to confirm or deny that he told visiting US senators the nuclear ban would be repealed [...] "by lunchtime" [...] if he was elected prime minister. Brash quit politics after losing the 2005 election and [...] "gone by lunchtime" [...] became a political catchphrase in New Zealand.|$|E

5000|$|Jacobson {{states that}} if <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> to reduce global warming, air {{pollution}} and energy instability, it should invest only in the best energy options, and that nuclear power {{is not one of}} them. Jacobson's analyses state that [...] "nuclear power results in up to 25 times more carbon emissions than wind energy, when reactor construction, uranium refining and transport are considered". These calculations are based on a 2009 paper of Jacobson's that was published in Energy and Environmental Science, which report nuclear emissions to be in the range of 68-180.1 g/kWh.|$|E
50|$|The {{treaty was}} instigated by Alexander Ramsey, the first {{governor}} of Minnesota Territory, and Luke Lea, Commissioner of Indian Affairs in Washington, D.C. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>the</b> treaty {{to gain control}} of agricultural lands for more European-American settlers.|$|R

(See Bir Tawil for a similar real-life example of this.) Bullwinkle J.

5000|$|Iraq is {{expected}} {{to begin the process of}} destroying Al Samoud two missiles on Saturday. Hans Blix, U.N. chief weapons inspector says [...] "It is a very significant piece of real disarmament". However, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer declares that the Iraq commitment to destroying these missiles is a fraud that President George W. Bush had predicted, and indicates that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> a total and complete disarmament of Iraq. He also repeats that if the United Nations does not act to disarm Baghdad, the United States will lead a coalition of voluntary countries to disarm Saddam Hussein.|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with a Russian journalist in 2010, Clinton stated [...] "One of the fears that I hear from Russians is that somehow <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> Russia to be weak. That could not be farther from the truth. Our goal is to help strengthen Russia. We see Russia with the strong culture, with the incredible intellectual capital that Russia has, as a leader in the 21st century. And we sometimes feel like we believe more in your future than sometimes Russians do." [...] After Russia's 2011 elections, Clinton said that they were [...] "neither free nor fair", a statement that was consistent with claims by elections observers and the statements by other Western leaders.|$|E
50|$|The ongoing Chinese Civil War {{and thus}} the {{question}} of which Chinese government was legitimate presented a dilemma to conference organizers. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> to invite <b>the</b> Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan to represent China, while <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom wished to invite the People's Republic of China (PRC) on mainland China as China's representative.

25|$|Before the Doha ministerial, {{negotiations}} {{had already}} been under way on trade in agriculture and trade in services. These ongoing negotiations had been required under the last round of multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay Round, 1986–1994). However, some countries, including <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>wanted</b> to expand <b>the</b> agriculture and services talks to allow trade-offs and thus achieve greater trade liberalization.|$|R

That's why we wanted Saddam tried in Iraq, and through the Iraqi judicial system--both to build up its legitimacy and to give Iraqis the sense of ownership that comes with having control over the legal process. Why, then, shouldn't we also turn over our own soldiers who were involved in either the Haditha massacre {{or any of the other}} possible massacres for trial under the Iraqi justice system?" ...|$|E

5000|$|US {{officials}} have denied the general perception in Pakistan that the US {{government wants to}} influence the electoral process in Pakistan {{to bring in a}} friendly government. US Secretary of State John Kerry skipped a planned visit to Pakistan to avoid accusations of meddling in the 11 May elections. Spokesperson Victoria Nuland stated that the message <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> to send out during the election season is [...] "we have no favourites among Pakistani politicians and we are looking forward to work with whoever is elected on May 11." [...] Secretary Kerry's decision to skip Pakistan during his South Asia visit is an indication of Washington's eagerness to maintain neutrality during the elections.|$|E
50|$|The New York City parade is {{held every}} third Saturday in September (on the 17th in 2016, on the 16th in 2017, {{and on the}} 15th in 2018).

50|$|Franklin Roosevelt {{promptly}} informed Winston Churchill that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to approach}} directly the Portuguese {{government for the}} purpose of also obtaining aviation facilities in the Azores.

50|$|When peace {{negotiations}} began after the Battle of Yorktown, a primary issue of debate was {{the fate of}} Black British soldiers.

5000|$|Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi refused {{foreign aid}} for the emergency, saying that Italians were [...] "proud people" [...] and had {{sufficient}} resources {{to deal with the}} crisis. However he singled out the United States, announcing that he would accept aid for reconstruction: [...] "If <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> to give a tangible sign of its solidarity with Italy, it could take on the responsibility of rebuilding heritage sites and churches. We would be very happy to have this support." [...] and suggested the USA help rebuild [...] "a small district of a town or a suburb". Aid was offered by Austria, Brazil, Croatia, the European Union, France, Germany, Spain, Greece, Slovakia, Israel, Portugal, Iran, Macedonia, Mexico,Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, Switzerland, Tunisia, the Turkish Red Crescent, Ukraine, and the United States.Aid was also offered by various organisations, companies, sport clubs and celebrities including ACF Fiorentina, Carla Bruni, Madonna, S.S.C.

40|$|Obama Administration {{officials}} {{have indicated that}} international cooperation will play {{a greater role in}} their national space policy than it did during the Bush administration. But they have not provided a clear and consistent logic specifying why <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wants</b> more space cooperation, what types of cooperation it will pursue, and how it will convince other countries to agree on, and comply with, accords that produce the desired policy results. Instead, their policy about space cooperation mixes elements from three different and somewhat contradictory strategic logics: a “Global Commons” logic, a “Strategic Stability” logic, and a “Space Governance for Global Security” logic. While each logic has attractive features, the Global Commons logic is unlikely to achieve significant results {{in a short period of}} time, while the Strategic Stability logic is more likely to promote competition, rather than cooperation. Following the Space Governance for Global Security logic could yield much larger dividends by using positive and negative forms of space cooperation to gain widespread support for the equitable rules and effective international institutions needed to address the central challenges identified by the 2010 National Security Strategy...|$|E
5000|$|Fisher {{was known}} for a unique idea towards nuclear deterrence. In a March 1981 paper, while {{discussing}} the importance on reaching a [...] "wise decision", {{especially in terms of}} nuclear arms, he suggested implanting the nuclear launch codes in a volunteer. If the President of <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> to activate nuclear weapons, he would be required to kill the volunteer to retrieve the codes.|$|R
25|$|The {{situation}} {{changed dramatically}} after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and <b>the</b> subsequent <b>United</b> <b>States</b> {{declaration of war}} upon Japan. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> every Latin American country to join the Allies, in order to generate a continent-wide resistance. Argentine resistance to do so motivated an embargo and blockade against Argentina. Castillo did, however, declare {{a state of emergency}} in Argentina after the attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|R
25|$|Later on, Novo Ecijanos would {{continue}} {{to participate in the}} drama of war, revolution and the fight for freedom. They would fight when the revolt against Spain continued after the peace treaty broke down and <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> after declaring war on Spain, promised to help Filipinos fight for freedom. Then, Novo Ecijanos again joined General Emilio Aguinaldo in the Philippine–American War (after it became evident <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>wanted</b> to make <b>the</b> Philippines their own colony).|$|R
