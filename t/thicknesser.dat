50|$|A {{thickness}} planer (also {{known in}} the UK and Australia as a <b>thicknesser</b> or in North America as a planer) is a woodworking machine to trim boards to a consistent thickness throughout their length and flat on both surfaces.|$|E
5000|$|Durden and Co. {{commenced}} {{business as}} general engineers to {{the automotive industry}} in 1948. The founder Frank Reginald Durden produced his first woodworking machine, a <b>thicknesser,</b> in 1951. This was quickly followed {{with the introduction of}} the popular [...] "Pacemaker" [...] universal woodworker in 1954. Several models of the 'Pacemaker" [...] were produced in the ensuing years and exported to different countries around the world.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{companies}} in Austria, Italy, France and Belgium manufacture what is commonly known in North America as a Euro(pean) combination machine, which typically contains a sliding-table saw with a scoring blade, a shaper, a <b>thicknesser,</b> a jointer, and a mortiser. These machines generally have 3 motors, {{one for the}} table saw, one for the shaper, and one shared by the thickness planer/jointer and mortiser.|$|E
50|$|The {{years from}} 1960 saw the company grow with the {{introduction}} of a range of machinery for the 'Do it yourself' market and educational training. The range included <b>thicknessers,</b> circular saws, planers, bandsaws and wood lathes.|$|R
5000|$|In woodworking, {{the ideal}} feed rate {{is one that}} is slow enough not to bog down the motor, yet fast enough to avoid burning the material. Certain woods, such as black cherry and maple are more prone to burning than others. The right feed rate is usually {{obtained}} by [...] "feel" [...] if the material is hand fed, or by trial and error if a power feeder is used. In <b>thicknessers</b> (planers), the wood is usually fed automatically through rubber or corrugated steel rollers. Some of these machines allow varying the feed rate, usually by changing pulleys. A slower feed rate usually results in a finer surface as more cuts are made for any length of wood.|$|R
50|$|It was {{converted}} to a sawmill around 1879. The waterwheel was removed and replaced with a Thomson double-vortex turbine, built by Williamsons (now Gilbert Gilkes & Gordon Ltd) of Kendal. This {{is thought to be}} the only remaining working variety of its type. In its heydey, the 10 hp (7.46 kW) created by the turbine drove a range of woodworking machinery - a rack sawbench, circular saw, <b>thicknesser</b> (planer), and lathes - by a series of belts and pulleys off a central line shaft.|$|E
40|$|The study {{identified}} {{practical skills}} possessed by woodwork graduates of Niger state technical colleges in using woodworking machines, hand tools and consumables. Three research questions were answered and two hypotheses tested at 0. 05 level of significance. A survey research design was adopted for the study. A structured questionnaire {{was used to}} gather data from one hundred and two respondents. Simple random sampling was applied to identify the study sample. Mean rating was used to answer research questions, t- test statistics {{was used to test}} the hypotheses. Cronbach Alpa Formula was used to determine reliability coefficient of the instrument. The reliability coefficient of the instrument was found to 0. 81. The findings of the study showed that Woodwork graduates of technical colleges in Niger State used all the woodworking machines listed except band saw machine, tenoning machine, mortiser and <b>thicknesser.</b> They used all the hand tools such as hammer, screw driver, hand plane, electric jig saw, scraper, pincer, plier, try square and spanner. It was recommended that State Government should provide modern machines for improving practical skills of woodwork students and Woodwork teachers should teach students how to apply formica on wood surfaces...|$|E
