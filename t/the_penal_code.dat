However, physicians are absolved of liability if patients refuse treatment for terminal illnesses by issuing advance medical directives.|$|E

40|$|In {{the debate}} that ensued after the {{extension}} of Shari'ah to <b>the</b> <b>penal</b> <b>codes</b> in northern Nigeria, there emerged, among other things, the thesis that the extension of Shari'ah can be accommodated under asymmetrical federalism. Many analysts have accepted this thesis uncritically. The main thrust {{of this article is}} to explore the main dimensions of the theory of asymmetrical federalism and find out whether the extension of Shari'ah to <b>the</b> <b>penal</b> <b>codes</b> in northern Nigeria can be accommodated under the theory of asymmetrical federalism. The article argues that the extension of Shari'ah to <b>the</b> <b>penal</b> <b>codes</b> in northern Nigeria represents an unusual form of asymmetrical federalism.

5|$|Suicide is a {{significant}} non-medical {{cause of death in}} Singapore. Although attempted suicide is an offence punishable with jail under section 309 of <b>the</b> <b>Penal</b> <b>Code,</b> Singapore still sees many cases of suicide each year. Between 2000 and 2004, 1,700 people killed themselves, and in 2007 suicides amounted to about 2.2% of all deaths. For every successful suicide attempt, there were seven unsuccessful ones.|$|E

5|$|In Singapore, <b>the</b> <b>Penal</b> <b>Code</b> {{lays out}} {{sanctions}} for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, which limits abortion {{to women who}} have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. By not conferring the right to life upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect {{the life of the mother}} and the life of the unborn from conception. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty in defining the beginning of life.|$|E

5|$|Infant {{mortality}} rates are high, and life expectancy at birth is 50.03years. Abortion is illegal in Malawi. <b>The</b> <b>Penal</b> <b>Code</b> punishes women who seek illegal or clinical abortion with 14 years and 7 years in prison. There {{is a high}} adult prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS, with an estimated 980,000adults (or 9.1% of the population) living with the disease in 2015. There are approximately 27,000deaths each year from HIV/AIDS, and over half a million children orphaned because of the disease (2015). Approximately 250new people are infected each day, and at least 70% of Malawi's hospital beds are occupied by HIV/AIDS patients. The high rate of infection has resulted in an estimated 5.8% of the farm labor force dying of the disease. The government spends over $120,000 each year on funerals for civil servants who die of the disease. In 2006, international superstar Madonna started Raising Malawi, a foundation that helps AIDS orphans in Malawi, and also financed a documentary about the hardships experienced by Malawian orphans, called I Am Because We Are. Raising Malawi also works with the Millennium Villages Project to improve education, health care, infrastructure and agriculture in Malawi.|$|E

25|$|Prior to 1870 the law {{relating}} to criminal procedure in force in Singapore was found {{mainly in the}} Indian Criminal Procedure Act 1852, which was applicable because the Supreme Government of India had power to legislate for the Straits Settlements.

However, in general it continued to apply the English system of criminal procedure to <b>the</b> <b>Penal</b> <b>Code.</b> This was subsequently found to be impracticable as <b>the</b> <b>Penal</b> <b>Code</b> had done away with the division of crimes into felonies and misdemeanours. Accordingly, the Criminal Procedure Ordinance 1873 was passed to remedy the situation.
