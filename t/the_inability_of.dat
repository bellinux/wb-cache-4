5|$|Other {{studies suggest}} that rivaling Carnotaurus did not deliver rapid head blows, but pushed slowly against each other with the upper sides of their skulls.

5|$|The {{economy of}} the small island of Cyprus with 840,000 people was hit by several huge blows in and around 2012 including, amongst other things, the €22 billion {{exposure}} of Cypriot banks to the Greek debt haircut, the downgrading of the Cypriot economy into junk status by international rating agencies and <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> the government to refund its state expenses.|$|E
5|$|The {{next major}} Japanese {{reinforcement}} effort failed during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, undertaken as Shōji and his troops struggled to reach friendly lines near the Matanikau.

5|$|Alexander was erudite and patronized both {{arts and}} sciences.

5|$|American goldfinches are {{occasionally}} {{victims of}} brood parasites, particularly brown-headed cowbirds. One {{study found that}} 9% of nests had brown-headed cowbird eggs in them. American goldfinches make very poor hosts for brood parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of brown-headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is {{despite the fact that}} the American goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against brood parasites. It is thought that <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> brown-headed cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough nutrition; the seed-rich diet of American goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.|$|E
5|$|Control of {{the growing}} {{tensions}} became hampered by increasing support of SAO Krajina being provided by the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA). <b>The</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> the Croatian Police {{to cope with the}} situation led to the establishment of the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) in May 1991. However, the development of the ZNG into a military force was hampered by a UN arms embargo, introduced in September, while the military conflict in Croatia continued to escalate—the Battle of Vukovar started on 26 August.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the novel}} as a {{legitimate}} literary form emerged throughout the 18th century, sensationalist and theatrical elements of fiction were being explored as grossly popular characteristics of the gothic. A common trope of the gothic novel was an excess of sentimentality, and Parsons’ The Castle of Wolfenbach is no exception. This excessive sentimentality presented itself in <b>the</b> <b>inabilities</b> <b>of</b> its heroines {{to take control of}} their worldly bodies in the face of supernatural terror, villainous deeds, or romantic gestures. Heroines swooned, wept, and “acted as if enraptured, delirious, or frenzied,” [...] whenever confronted with something out of the ordinary.|$|R
5|$|Crypsis, or <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> {{humans to}} {{visually}} distinguish between {{two or more}} distinct species, has recently been discovered among lemurs, particularly within the sportive lemurs (Lepilemur) and mouse lemurs (Microcebus). With sportive lemurs, subspecies were traditionally defined based on slight morphological differences, but new genetic evidence has supported giving full species status to these regional populations. In the case of mouse lemurs, the gray mouse lemur (M. murinus), golden-brown mouse lemur (M. ravelobensis), and Goodman's mouse lemur (M. lehilahytsara) were considered the same species until recently, when genetic tests identified them as cryptic species.|$|E
5|$|During the {{preceding}} Tang dynasty, {{the civil service}} examinations did not yet produce {{the high number of}} officials as they would during the Song dynasty; a hereditary aristocracy remained dependent on the court for attaining rank and holding office. Song rulers, particularly Emperor Huizong, encountered a great deal of political opposition despite attempts to attain the ideals of the sage kings of antiquity. <b>The</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> the sovereign to monopolize political authority was linked to the rise of a new class of gentry and scholar-official who filled the bureaucracy.|$|E
5|$|However, {{problems}} arose due to <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> contemporary naval {{technology to}} simultaneously {{meet the requirements}} for weight, speed, range and armament. On 8 April 1938 German Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, {{the commander in chief}} of the Kriegsmarine, informed the Oberkommando der Marine (German Naval High Command) that the Type 1937J design work was to be stopped, and that a further eight Type 36 destroyers were to be built instead. Although no ships of the Type 1937J were ever ordered or laid down, they influenced the later project studies: the Type 1938Ac, 1938Ad, and 1938B destroyers.|$|E
5000|$|Reaction to the wins by a fake {{candidate}} {{on campus}} were swift and mostly good-humored.

50|$|However, {{the usage}} of English-style (ex. “quote” and ‘quote’) marks is growing in Portugal.

5|$|In 1495 the Italian Renaissance {{arrived in}} France, {{imported}} by King Charles VIII after his invasion of Italy. A factor that promoted {{the spread of}} secularism was <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> the Church to offer assistance against the Black Death. Francis I imported Italian art and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci, and built ornate palaces at great expense. Writers such as François Rabelais, Pierre de Ronsard, Joachim du Bellay and Michel de Montaigne, painters such as Jean Clouet, and musicians such as Jean Mouton also borrowed from {{the spirit of the}} Renaissance.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} goods {{produced}} indigenously, {{it was estimated}} that due to <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> traditional suppliers to deliver manufactured goods because of trade embargoes and shipping shortages up to 400 new articles were produced in Australian factories {{as a result of the}} war. This was not an insignificant number, although the transformation of the Australian economy as a result of World War I was by no means as significant as that which occurred during World War II. The expansion of the steel industry that occurred during this time laid the foundation for future industrialisation.|$|E
5|$|M. nigrocincta ants are diurnal {{and do not}} hibernate. They are omnivores, {{and feed}} on other insects {{including}} caterpillars and spiders, as well as honey water. M. nigrocincta has been observed to prey on the larvae of imperial hairstreak butterflies, even jumping while carrying them. Predators of the M. nigrocincta (and the Myrmecia genus as a whole) includes spiders, birds, lizards, mammals and other predatory invertebrates, including assassin bugs and Redbacks. The ants have been recorded visiting flowers of Eucalyptus regnans and Senna acclinis and are considered as a possible pollination vector for E. regnans trees. Although Senna acclinis is self-compatible, <b>the</b> <b>inability</b> <b>of</b> M. nigrocincta to appropriately release pollen would restrict capacity to effect pollination.|$|E
