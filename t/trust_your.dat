500|$|Gilbert {{was mostly}} {{collaborative}} with Dahl's work, as the writer declared: [...] "He not only helped in script conferences, but {{had some good}} ideas and then left you alone, and when you produced the finished thing, he shot it. Other directors have such an ego {{that they want to}} rewrite it and put their own dialogue in, and it's usually disastrous. What I admired so much about Lewis Gilbert was that he just took the screenplay and shot it. That's the way to direct: You either <b>trust</b> <b>your</b> writer or you don't." ...|$|E

500|$|Owners {{and players}} met again on October 18–20 for 30 hours of talks over three days. [...] They met {{before a federal}} mediator, George Cohen—the {{director}} of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. Cohen tried unsuccessfully to resolve the 2011 NFL lockout. At {{the conclusion of the}} meetings, the sides remained split on the revenue split and the structure of the salary cap. [...] The league proposed a 50–50 split of BRI, and the players proposed a range that would allow them as low as 50% of BRI to a maximum of 53%, depending on the league's revenues. Gilbert told the players to trust that the salary cap issues could be resolved if they accepted the 50–50 proposal. Hunter responded, [...] "I can't <b>trust</b> <b>your</b> gut. I got to trust my own gut." [...] Silver and San Antonio Spurs owner Peter Holt told reporters that the players refused to negotiate after the 50–50 proposal. Fisher told the press [...] "that you guys were lied to" [...] by the owners. Hunter said the owners told them, [...] "Take it or leave it." [...] Cohen decided that there was [...] "no useful purpose" [...] to continue mediation. Tentative agreements were reached on smaller issues, allowing a one-time exemption for teams to waive players without counting against the salary cap, granting teams an annual exemption to waive players and prorate the impact to the salary cap over multiple years, and a mid-level exception of $5 million.|$|E
500|$|Cryer's {{long run}} of {{unsuccessful}} TV projects finally ended three years later. Against {{the wishes of}} CBS executives (who were aware of his past failures) and due to a friendship with Charlie Sheen, he was cast in 2003 to portray Alan Harper on the hit comedy series Two and a Half Men. He has earned seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations and two wins for his acting work on the show. In a comment on the show's high ratings, he said: [...] "When you’re on a show that's fighting for survival every week, you stop trusting your instincts, because you think, ‘My instincts haven't worked so far.’ But when people clearly like the show and are watching it in great numbers, it takes {{a huge amount of}} pressure off you. It allows you to <b>trust</b> <b>your</b> instincts and go with what has worked for you before." [...] After former co-star Charlie Sheen's departure from the series, Cryer's character became the show's main protagonist (with Ashton Kutcher being cast as the co-lead) throughout the final four seasons, mainly due to the show's retooled plot. At the end of the series of Two and a Half Men, Cryer is the only actor to have appeared in every episode of the series, since Sheen was fired in March 2011 and his on-screen son Angus T. Jones left the series at the end of season 10, after expressing the show as [...] "filth" [...] and that Jones is a [...] "paid hypocrite". All appeared to be forgiven, however, as Jones, contrary to Charlie Sheen, appeared to great applause in the finale. [...] Before being cast for Two and a Half Men, Cryer auditioned for the role of Gaius Baltar on the Sci-Fi Channel's reimagined Battlestar Galactica, but the role went to James Callis. In 2008, Cryer appeared with Laurence Fishburne and James Cromwell in the film Tortured, and in 2009 co-starred with James Spader in the film Shorts.|$|E

2500|$|Carson hosted several shows besides Carson's Cellar, {{including}} the game show Earn Your Vacation (1954) and the CBS variety show The Johnny Carson Show (1955–1956). He {{was a guest}} panelist on the original To Tell the Truth starting in 1960, later becoming a regular panelist from 1961 until 1962. After the prime time The Johnny Carson Show failed, he moved to New York City to host Who Do You Trust? (1957–1962), formerly known as Do You <b>Trust</b> <b>Your</b> Wife?. In 1958, he appeared as a guest star in an episode entitled [...] "Do You <b>Trust</b> <b>Your</b> Wife" [...] on NBC's short-lived variety show, The Polly Bergen Show. On Who Do You Trust?, Carson met his future sidekick and straight man, Ed McMahon. Although he believed moving to daytime would hurt his career, Who Do You Trust? was a success. It was the first show where he could ad lib and interview guests, and because of Carson's on-camera wit, the show became [...] "the hottest item on daytime television" [...] during his five years at ABC.|$|E

He appeared in Dentist in the Chair (1961) and later regretted not choosing the Carry Ons over the dental comedies. Other presenting jobs in the 1960s included hosting Candid Camera and compèring Sunday Night at the London Palladium. Around 1969 he was a partner, with Malcolm Mitchell, in the Mitchell Monkhouse Agency. In 1979 he starred in a US sketch comedy television series called Bonkers! with the Hudson Brothers and Joan Rivers, a job he hated. In the early 1970s he appeared on BBC Radio in Mostly Monkhouse with Josephine Tewson and David Jason.|$|E
2500|$|Fox {{subsequently}} {{released a}} set of official rules for the game, which can be summarized [...] "There are no real rules". When the promotional New Girl True American Bus Tour went through 19 American cities in 2012, the writers stated lack of time rather than not knowing the rules for not writing down the rules. Liz Meriwether said the game would not be easier to comprehend in later appearances, as the writers' goal is to actually {{make it harder to}} understand. She agreed with The A.V. Club that [...] "It's much funnier if the rules make no sense." [...] As more people attempted playing the game in real life, Baer pointed out that most people were [...] "getting too drunk too fast" [...] and did not focus enough on strategy, so the writers were thinking of establishing more rules for guidance. Meriwether advised to [...] "just <b>trust</b> <b>your</b> hearts, get really wasted, and look inside yourselves. I think you'll find the rules were there all along." ...|$|E

You're {{going to be there for}} each other, and they're going to be there for you. For example, I'm going to fall back, knowing that you'll catch me. Then I let myself fall backward, and sure enough, I was caught. Everyone gets out some nervous laughter, and then they all took turns doing it. By the time it got around to Mariska Hargitay, we'd already done it with ten or eleven students, and they had clearly gotten the point. Then it was Mariska's turn. 'Okay, Mariska, cross your arms in front of you and gently fall back,' I said. She fell back and nobody caught her. She fell flat on her ass. I was horrified. This had never happened in one of my classes before." ...|$|E

[...] "Jenny from the Block" [...] {{features}} lyrics about Lopez remaining humble despite fame and fortune.

The Age wrote that the song intones Lopez's [...] "modest childhood roots, vowing she wishes to remain simple despite her diamonds", while MTV said that she finds [...] "the middle ground between Hollywood A-Lister and Big Apple B-Girl" [...] on the [...] "club-banging" [...] song. In the ballad [...] "Again", Lopez considers finding love again; [...] "I was scared to let go and <b>trust</b> <b>your</b> love," [...] she sings in the second verse.

2500|$|The Prisoner {{was very}} popular with the gaming press. [...] The {{magazine}} Peelings II awarded the game an A+, its highest rating, and noted that if only the game had high-resolution graphics, {{it would have been}} a candidate for its Game of the Year Award. According to Softalk, [...] "What puts this game head and shoulders above other adventures is that while the player is seeking the information needed to escape from the Island, the computer is actively seeking the information that will make the player lose the game. [...] The dual challenges of learning about the Island while avoiding the subtle and not-so-subtle traps laid by the computer make the game both interesting and exciting". Softline stated that the game [...] "that exercises your intellect like few games", and concluded that [...] "The Prisoner is imaginative, well presented and thought provoking. Hats off to Dave Mullich and Edu-ware Services for bringing real mental challenge to the game industry". BYTE stated that the game [...] "is not for the easily frustrated ... The Prisoner is complex beyond belief, nearly unbeatable, and at times irrational on purpose". It warned, [...] "if you follow the rules, <b>trust</b> <b>your</b> fellow man, or display anything less than a total commitment to anti-social, anti-island behavior, you will be hopelessly doomed to repeated failure", and concluded," [...] it will appeal to puzzle solvers and seekers of the bizarre".|$|E
