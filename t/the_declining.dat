30|$|Given the {{inability}} to explain <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> by shifts {{in the composition of}} individual and business characteristics, we explored a few additional methods of explaining <b>the</b> <b>decline.</b> <b>The</b> distribution of establishment-level employment change has been narrowing during the last 10 to 15 years, fully accounting for <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> in job creation and job destruction, yet this narrowing only explains about a third of <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> in hires and separations. This tells us that the explanation for <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> in hires and separations will be different than the explanation for <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> in job creation and job destruction. We also find that <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> in hires and separations is being driven by <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> in job-to-job flows and the disappearance of short-duration jobs in the U.S. economy.|$|R
30|$|We {{document}} {{and attempt to}} explain <b>the</b> recent <b>decline</b> in employment dynamics in the U.S. We have four major empirical findings. First, each measure exhibits a “stair step” pattern, with <b>the</b> <b>declines</b> concentrated in recessions and little increase during subsequent expansions. Second, changes {{in the composition of}} workers and businesses can explain only a small amount of <b>the</b> <b>decline.</b> Third, any explanation for <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> in job creation and job destruction will account for no more than one-third of <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> in hires and separations. Fourth, <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> in hires and separations is driven by the disappearance of short-duration jobs.|$|R
40|$|Our {{goal was}} to {{determine}} why the rate of acetylene reduction by nodules of actinorhizal plants declines after an initial peak value. <b>The</b> <b>decline</b> was eliminated by pretreatment with argon, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> is initiated by cessation of ammonia synthesis. When O 2 concentration was decreased during <b>the</b> <b>decline,</b> <b>the</b> rate of acetylene reduction increased. This shows that during <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> there is either O 2 toxicity or competition between respiration and nitrogenase for reductant. <b>The</b> <b>decline</b> was not eliminated when uptake hydrogenase was inactivated by pretreatment with acetylene, showing that cessation of H 2 oxidation is not {{the primary cause of}} <b>the</b> <b>decline.</b> <b>The</b> effects of a variety of other treatments on <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> were also studied. Overall, we conclude that the cessation of ammonia formation is the primary cause of <b>the</b> acetylene-induced <b>decline.</b> We hypothesize that the supply of reductant for nitrogenase depends on amino acids that are depleted following cessation of ammonia formation. We also conclude that the initial peak rate of acetylene reduction provides the best measure of nitrogenase activity...|$|R

5|$|Blackcaps {{and other}} small birds are {{illegally}} trapped and hunted in large numbers in Mediterranean countries, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Malta, Libya, Egypt and Cyprus, where they are considered as a delicacy. Despite hunting and natural hazards, the European population of the blackcap has been rising for several decades as the range extends northwards, for example to Scotland and Denmark. There are occasional nesting records from outside the main range, such as in northern Israel and the Faroes, and wandering birds may appear further afield in Iceland or on the islands of Arctic Russia.

5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> {{prevalence}} of marriage, {{more than three-quarters}} of Americans will marry at least once in their lifetime. The average age for marriage for a male was 26.8 and 25.1 for a female. Americans are also likely to remarry after their first divorce. In 1990, 40% of all marriages were remarriages. All together one can conclude that while there is no prevalent average household arrangement, most Americans (the average Joe) will get married and divorced once with a considerable number of Americans remarrying at least once.|$|E
30|$|In section IV, we analyze <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> {{in gross}} worker flows (hires and separations), {{employing}} some helpful identities that relate gross worker flows to gross job flows (job creation and job destruction), {{as well as}} to job-to-job flows. We find that <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> in gross job flows can be described as a narrowing of the distribution of employer growth rates, but this change in the distribution of gross job flows only explains about a third of <b>the</b> <b>decline</b> in gross worker flows. This implies that whatever economic forces are driving <b>the</b> <b>declines</b> in gross job flows, there are different forces that are driving <b>the</b> <b>declines</b> in gross worker flows. Analyzing the relationship between gross worker flows and job-to-job flows, we find that declines in both short-duration jobs and job-to-job flows are driving <b>the</b> <b>declines</b> in gross worker flows.|$|R

5|$|Experimental {{breeding}} {{programs in}} the early 20th century succeeded in re-establishing the breed to some extent, but mechanization, combined with two world wars, again resulted in the breed almost becoming extinct. In the 1980s, concerned with <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> population numbers, interested breeders undertook a promotional program, which resulted in renewed interest in the breed. By the 1990s, population numbers were higher, and genetic studies in 1998 and 2012 found relatively high levels of genetic diversity for a small breed. However, livestock conservation organizations still consider the breed to be at risk, due to low population numbers.|$|E
5|$|Floods are {{the most}} common natural {{disaster}} in India. The heavy southwest monsoon rains cause the Brahmaputra and other rivers to distend their banks, often flooding surrounding areas. Though they provide rice paddy farmers with a largely dependable source of natural irrigation and fertilisation, the floods can kill thousands and displace millions. Excess, erratic, or untimely monsoon rainfall may also wash away or otherwise ruin crops. Almost all of India is flood-prone, and extreme precipitation events, such as flash floods and torrential rains, have become increasingly common in central India over the past several decades, coinciding with rising temperatures. Mean annual precipitation totals have remained steady due to <b>the</b> <b>declining</b> frequency of weather systems that generate moderate amounts of rain.|$|E
