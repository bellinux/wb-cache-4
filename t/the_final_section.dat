5|$|I-475 {{was first}} opened to {{traffic in the}} early 1970s. The first section was built between I-75/US10 northward to M-21/M-78. The second section was built from I-75/US10/US23 to BUSM-54 along {{the north side of}} town. These two {{sections}} were opened on November 9, 1973 and September 26, 1974 respectively. <b>The</b> <b>final</b> <b>section</b> was opened between them in 1981.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the line}} was double track, with Shoreditch station and <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>sections</b> into <b>the</b> {{southern}} termini single track, the latter {{because of lack of}} space. This required trains to alternate between the two southern termini.|$|R
5|$|In {{the last}} section in {{spirited}} 3/8 time, the predominant mood is of joyous exaltation reflecting the text from Isaiah. The structure of the choral material in this final section complements that of the first section; there a fugal passage was enclosed between two homophonic episodes; here a homophonic episode is preceded and followed by fugal passages. While the first section is preceded by the lengthy orchestral sinfonia, <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>section</b> ends with a short coda for full chorus and orchestra.|$|E
5|$|On 6 October 1884, <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>section</b> of the Inner Circle was opened, {{along with}} Cannon Street station.

5|$|The {{first section}} opened from Ullevål stadion via Nydalen to Storo on 20 August 2003, costing NOK590 million. With the opening, line 4 was {{extended}} from Ullevål stadion to Storo. Nydalen {{had grown up}} as an urban redevelopment area after the local industry had been abandoned in the 1980s, where 14,800 jobs had been located by 2004. On 20 August 2006, <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>section</b> opened, from Storo via Sinsen to Carl Berners plass, with the whole project costing NOK1,348 million.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the project}} made strides toward {{completion}} in 1976, {{it did not}} meet Moolin's goal of having all pipe installed, insulated, and tested by winter. <b>The</b> <b>final</b> <b>section</b> of main pipeline was welded in place on December 6, {{but not all of}} the pipeline was tested before winter set in. At the end of 1976, the project was 92 percent complete. The pipeline was 97.5 percent complete, the pump stations were 92 percent done, and the marine terminal stood at 83 percent. Because the terminal was the lagging portion of the project, its full work crew continued operations through the winter and into 1977.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, {{the highway}} west of Hessel was shifted to follow an {{alignment}} closer to Lake Huron; the MSHD transferred the former routing of M-134 to local control at that time. In October 1963, <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>section</b> of I-75/US2 freeway {{opened in the}} UP; M-134's western terminus was truncated slightly to end at the new freeway instead of the former routing of US2 along Mackinac Trail. In 1989, MDOT extended the trunkline to add a segment on Drummond Island; in the process, the Drummond Island Ferry across the DeTour Passage {{was added to the}} route. The entire length of the highway was dedicated as a Pure Michigan Byway on October 16, 2015.|$|E
50|$|In 1910 land {{sales were}} held of resumed Burrandowan land, which sold quickly as a railway to Nanango was anticipated. In 1917 <b>the</b> <b>final</b> <b>sections</b> of resumed land {{on this and}} several other runs in the {{district}} were allocated for the Soldier Settlement scheme.|$|R

5|$|The bulk of {{the route}} runs through forested areas, {{especially}} near the Učka range and near Pazin, with agricultural land in between those areas– most of it located between the Ivoli and Lupoglav interchanges. <b>The</b> <b>final</b> <b>section</b> of the route, near Opatija and the A7 motorway, runs through coastal areas affected by urbanization. The route crosses no major watercourses, although creeks adjacent to or spanned by the route drain into the Pazinčica and Boljunčica rivers, or directly into the Adriatic Sea {{in the case of}} watercourses flowing down Učka's eastern slopes. The Učka Tunnel contains a spring discovered during its construction and used for the water supply of Opatija ever since.|$|E
5|$|The {{city council}} {{voted in favor}} of {{building}} the Ring Line on 25 June 1997, against the votes of the Progress Party.

Construction started in June, with the Agency for Road and Transport of the municipality responsible for construction. The first section opened from Ullevål stadion via Nydalen to Storo on 20 August 2003. With the opening, and Line 4 was extended from Ullevål stadion to Storo.

A final tip {{from each of the}} Fab Five, usually relating to one of the topics covered in the episode, plays just before the credits.|$|E
