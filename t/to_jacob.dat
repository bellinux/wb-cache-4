5|$|A Bulgarian nobleman, Despot Jacob Svetoslav sought {{assistance}} from Stephen after his domains, which were {{situated in the}} regions south of Vidin, were overrun by Byzantine troops {{in the second half}} of 1263. Stephen sent reinforcements under the command of Ladislaus II Kán, Voivode of Transylvania to Bulgaria. The Voivode routed the Byzantines and drove them out of Bulgaria. Stephen granted Vidin <b>to</b> <b>Jacob</b> Svetoslav who accepted his suzerainty.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{considered}} Zeppelin to {{have achieved}} its main objective of tying down German {{forces in the}} region until after the invasion of Normandy, although it {{did not appear to}} convince German high command that major Allied landings would occur in the Mediterranean. Instead, Zeppelin helped the Allies achieve their objective by convincing the Germans of the threat of small invasions, stopping them from removing the defensive forces. According <b>to</b> <b>Jacob</b> Field, the operation successfully detained 25 divisions in defensive positions in the region.|$|E
5|$|NYC Ferry {{operates}} three {{shuttle bus}} routes. One is a preexisting NY Waterway {{service to the}} East 34th Street landing. The other two are brand-new services to the Rockaway landing, which is at Beach 108th Street. One route goes west <b>to</b> <b>Jacob</b> Riis Park, while the other was originally planned for operation between the ferry landing and Beach 67th Street, but was ultimately extended eastward. The Environmental Impact Statement provided for {{an extension of the}} Beach 67th Street bus to Beach 31st Street via Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach Channel Drive, but de Blasio's office said that extending the bus further would cause a bus fleet shortage, resulting in passengers missing their boats. As of June 2017, the East Shuttle bus only runs to Beach 35th Street.|$|E

5|$|Sometime later, Anna {{is finally}} offered a new visa.

5|$|Andrew Johnson {{was born}} in Raleigh, North Carolina, on December 29, 1808, <b>to</b> <b>Jacob</b> Johnson (1778–1812) and Mary ("Polly") McDonough (1783–1856), a laundress. He was of English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry. He had a brother William, four years his senior, and an older sister Elizabeth, who died in childhood. Johnson's birth in a log cabin was a {{political}} asset in the mid-19th century, and he would frequently remind voters of his humble origins. Jacob Johnson was a poor man, as had been his father, William Johnson, but he became town constable of Raleigh before marrying and starting a family. He died of an apparent heart attack while ringing the town bell, shortly after rescuing three drowning men, when his son Andrew was three. Polly Johnson worked as a washerwoman and became the sole support of her family. Her occupation was then looked down on, as it often took her into other homes unaccompanied. There were even rumors that Andrew, who did not resemble his brother or sister, had been fathered by another man. Polly Johnson eventually remarried, to Turner Doughtry, who was as poor as she was.|$|E
5|$|Following Jones's {{death in}} 1806, his widow Margaret Morton Jones {{continued}} to reside at Bogota until her own death in 1822. Jaquelin Harvie, {{the son of}} Jones's daughter Margaret Jones Harvie and her husband John Harvie, purchased the Bogota estate {{after the death of}} Jones's wife, and Harvie subsequently sold the property in 1830 <b>to</b> <b>Jacob</b> Strayer, who built the current house in 1845–1847. The original house erected and occupied by Jones was demolished shortly after the construction of the current house. The site of Jones's house is presently located on property no longer part of the Bogota estate, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 25, 2009. A log tenant house estimated to have been built during the mid-18th century during the ownership of the Jones family is extant, and remains part of the current Bogota estate, as of 2008.|$|E

5|$|Meeker {{was born}} in Butler County, Ohio, <b>to</b> <b>Jacob</b> and Phoebe Meeker. His family {{relocated}} to Indiana {{when he was a}} boy. He married Eliza Jane Sumner in 1851; the following year the couple, with Ezra's brother and with their newborn son, set out for the Oregon Territory, where land could be claimed and settled on. Although they endured hardships on the Trail in the journey of nearly six months, the entire party survived the trek. Meeker and his family briefly stayed near Portland, then journeyed north to live in the Puget Sound region. They settled at what is now Puyallup in 1862, where Meeker grew hops for use in brewing beer. By 1887, his business had made him wealthy, and his wife built a large mansion for the family. In 1891 an infestation of hop aphids destroyed his crops and took much of his fortune. He later tried his hand at a number of ventures, and made four largely unsuccessful trips to the Klondike, taking groceries and hoping to profit from the gold rush.|$|E
5|$|Polar front {{theory is}} {{attributed}} <b>to</b> <b>Jacob</b> Bjerknes, and {{was derived from}} a coastal network of observation sites in Norway during World War I. This theory proposed that the main inflow into a cyclone was concentrated along two lines of convergence, one ahead (or east) of the low and another trailing equatorward (south in the Northern Hemisphere and north in the Southern Hemisphere) and behind (or west) of the low. The convergence line ahead of the low became known as either the steering line or the warm front. The trailing convergence zone {{was referred to as}} the squall line or cold front. Areas of clouds and rainfall appeared to be focused along these convergence zones. A conveyor belt, also referred to as the warm conveyor belt, is a term describing the flow of a stream of warm moist air originating within the warm sector (or generally equatorward) of an extratropical cyclone in advance of the cold front which slopes up above and poleward (north in the Northern Hemisphere and south in the Southern Hemisphere) of the surface warm front. The concept of the conveyor belt originated in 1969.|$|E
5|$|The {{institute}} {{and the society}} experienced a hiatus {{during the course of}} the war. The school held sessions under Reverend Nelson, and subsequently William C. Clayton in 1866. Clayton later served in the West Virginia Senate. The Romney Literary Society was revived in 1869, and following the passage of a bill which established the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind in March 1870, the society offered the institute's building and grounds to the state of West Virginia for the new school. The institute's property was transferred to the state and the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind opened for its first term on September 29, 1870. Following the schools' subsequent expansions, the institute's former building became the center portion of the administration building of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind, in which capacity it serves at the present day. In addition <b>to</b> <b>Jacob</b> and Clayton, Robert White, Attorney General of West Virginia, was also an alumnus of the institute.|$|E
