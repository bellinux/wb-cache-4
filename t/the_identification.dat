5|$|A COBOL {{program is}} split into four divisions: <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> division, the {{environment}} division, the data division and the procedure division. <b>The</b> <b>identification</b> division specifies {{the name and}} type of the source element and is where classes and interfaces are specified. The environment division specifies any program features that depend on the system running it, such as files and character sets. The data division is used to declare variables and parameters.

40|$|The factors {{influencing}} <b>the</b> knowledge <b>identification</b> process are changing in a dynamic environment {{along with their}} evaluation methods that are controversially considered in scientific literature and practice. This paper examines the issue concerning {{the assessment of the}} factors affecting the efficiency of <b>the</b> knowledge <b>identification</b> process. Different authors suggest varying interpretations and approaches to the factors affecting the efficiency of <b>the</b> knowledge <b>identification</b> process. Therefore, an issue of how to assess and what approach reflects and conveys reality more accurately and comprehensively emerges. These questions are investigated combining approaches developed by different scientists to the aspects assessing the factors affecting <b>the</b> knowledge <b>identification</b> process. <b>The</b> paper is aimed at determining the factors affecting the efficiency of <b>the</b> knowledge <b>identification</b> process in <b>the</b> sector of information technology, which could lead to assumptions about assessing the efficiency of <b>the</b> knowledge <b>identification</b> process. In order to determine and assess the {{factors influencing}} the efficiency of <b>the</b> knowledge <b>identification</b> process, survey and expert evaluation methods have been applied...|$|R
5|$|Of noble birth, Cuthbert {{is first}} {{recorded}} as the Abbot of Lyminge, {{from where he}} was elevated to the See of Hereford in 736. <b>The</b> <b>identification</b> of the Cuthbert who was Bishop of Hereford with the Cuthbert who became archbishop, however, comes from Florence of Worcester and other post-Conquest sources. The contemporary record in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that Cuthbert was consecrated archbishop, where if he had been Bishop of Hereford, he would have been translated. No consecration is needed when a bishop is translated from one see to another. Given the nature of the sources, <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> of the bishop of Hereford with the archbishop of Canterbury, while likely, must not be regarded as proven.|$|E
