50|$|The {{process was}} {{time-consuming}} and potentially dangerous. Marr was injured when he spilled molten solder on himself. Seeking a safer, more efficient connection method, Marr, {{working in his}} home workshop, developed the first pressure-type wire connector. In 1914, he produced a set-screw version, the forerunner of the present-day <b>twist-on</b> <b>connector</b> used throughout North America.|$|E
5000|$|Special {{twist-on}} connectors (or [...] "wire nuts") {{are available}} for joining aluminum to copper wire, which are pre-filled with a special antioxidant compound in a low-residue polybutene base with a zinc dust added to the compound, intended to abrade the wires and prevent corrosion of the connection. As of 2014 {{there was only one}} <b>twist-on</b> <b>connector</b> rated or [...] "UL Listed" [...] for connecting aluminum and copper branch circuit wires in the U.S., which is the Ideal No. 65 [...] "Twister Al/Cu wire connector". These special twist-on connectors have a distinctive purple color, have been UL Listed for aluminum to copper branch circuit wire connections since 1995, and according to the manufacturer's current literature are [...] "perfect for pig-tailing a copper conductor onto aluminum branch circuit wiring in retrofit applications". The CPSC still considers the use of twist-on connectors, including the Ideal No. 65 [...] "Twister Al/Cu wire connector", to be a temporary repair. According to the CPSC, even using (listed) twist-on connectors to attach copper pigtails to older aluminum wires as a temporary repair requires special installation procedures, including abrading and pre-twisting the wires. However, the manufacturer's instructions for the Ideal No. 65 Twister only recommends pre-twisting the wires, and does not state it's required. Also the instructions do not mention physically abrading the wires as recommended by the CPSC, although the manufacturer current literature states the pre-filled [...] "compound cuts aluminum oxide". Some researchers have criticized the UL listing/tests for this wire connector, and there have been reported problems with tests (without pre-twisting) and installations. However, it is unknown if the reported installation problems were associated with unqualified persons attempting these repairs, or not using recommended special installation procedures (such as abrading and pre-twisting the wires as recommended by the CPSC for older aluminum wire, or at least pre-twisting the wires as recommended by Ideal for their connectors).|$|E
50|$|Ceramic <b>twist-on</b> <b>connectors</b> {{are made}} for {{high-temperature}} applications, such as heating appliances.|$|R
50|$|Ordinary <b>twist-on</b> <b>connectors</b> are {{not rated}} for wet use (such as exposed {{outdoors}} or buried underground). Special gel-filled connectors {{must be used}} in this circumstance.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Twist-on</b> wire <b>connectors</b> are not {{generally}} recommended {{for use with}} aluminum wire. [...] The US Consumer Product Safety Commission does not approve of their use with aluminum wire, and approves of only two (alternative) methods of connection. [...] In spite of this, several companies manufacture <b>twist-on</b> <b>connectors</b> which they claim are designed specifically for, and rated for, use with aluminum conductors.|$|R
50|$|<b>Twist-on</b> <b>connectors</b> {{are also}} known as wire nuts, wire connectors, cone connectors, or thimble connectors. One trade name for such connectors, Marrette, {{is derived from the}} name of their {{inventor}} (see History).|$|R
50|$|<b>Twist-on</b> <b>connectors</b> are {{not often}} used on wire gauges thicker than AWG #10 (5.26 mmÂ²), because such solid wires are too stiff to be {{reliably}} connected with this method. Instead, set screw connectors, clamps or crimp connectors are used.|$|R
5000|$|... "Pig-tailing" [...] which {{involves}} splicing a short length of copper wire (pigtail) {{to the original}} aluminum wire, and then attaching the copper wire to the existing electrical device. The splice of the copper pigtail to the existing aluminum wire can be accomplished with special crimp connectors, special miniature lug-type <b>connectors,</b> or approved <b>twist-on</b> <b>connectors</b> (with special installation procedures).|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Two light {{switches}} and wiring, as {{installed in the}} United States. Switches are fastened in a non-metallic box, then a cover plate is installed. This installation uses non-metallic-sheathed cable and <b>twist-on</b> wire <b>connectors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Twist-on</b> wire <b>connectors</b> are {{a type of}} {{electrical}} connector used to fasten two or more low-voltage (or extra-low-voltage) electrical conductors. They are widely used in North America in residential, commercial and industrial building power wiring.|$|R
50|$|A common {{application}} of the lineman's pliers in gripping and twisting wires together, preparatory to installing a <b>twist-on</b> wire <b>connector.</b> Pliers may also be used in pulling a fish-tape, to crimp metals, and to pull nails and other fasteners.|$|R
5000|$|In North American {{building}} wiring, <b>twist-on</b> wire <b>connectors</b> {{are frequently}} used in low-voltage power circuits for wires {{up to about}} #10 AWG in size. These allow wire connections in electrical boxes that are more quickly installed than the obsolete practice of soldering and taping wires.|$|R
50|$|<b>Twist-on</b> wire <b>connectors</b> are {{commonly}} color-coded {{to indicate the}} connector size and, hence, their capacity. They {{are commonly}} used {{as an alternative to}} terminal blocks or the soldering of conductors together, since they are quicker to install and, unlike soldered connections, allow easy subsequent removal for future modifications.|$|R
50|$|<b>Twist-on</b> wire <b>connectors</b> are {{typically}} installed by hand. They may have external grooves {{to make them}} easier to handle and apply. Winglike extensions are commonly molded into higher quality connectors to reduce operator muscle fatigue when installing {{a large number of}} the connectors. Such extensions also allow these connectors to be installed with a common nut driver or a specialized tool.|$|R
5000|$|Special {{feedthrough}} <b>twist-on</b> wire <b>connectors</b> {{differ from}} standard wire connectors {{in that they}} have an additional opening {{at the top of the}} insulated cap. This allows a single-conductor bare wire to be pushed through the hole, forming a [...] "pigtail" [...] section which can be attached to a grounding screw. These feedthrough connectors are typically green, and are also called [...] "screw-on grounding connectors".|$|R
50|$|This {{common and}} simple splice {{is not very}} strong mechanically. It can be made {{stronger}} by coating it with solder, {{or it can be}} twisted and then held in place by the internal metal spring or threads of a <b>twist-on</b> wire <b>connector,</b> also called a wire nut. Because it is not very strong, the splice is not meant to connect wires that will be pulled or stressed. Rather, it is intended for wires that are protected inside an enclosure or junction box.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Twist-on</b> wire <b>connectors</b> are {{available}} {{in a variety of}} sizes and shapes. While their exterior covering is typically made from insulating plastic, their means of connection is a tapered coiled metal insert, which threads onto the wires and holds them securely. When such a connector is twisted onto the stripped and twisted-together ends of wires, the wires are drawn into the connector's metal insert and squeezed together inside it. Electrical continuity is maintained by both the direct twisted wire-to-wire contact and by contact with the metal insert.|$|R
50|$|Another {{specialized}} connector {{version has}} a permanently attached wire pigtail {{protruding from the}} top of the insulated cap. The pigtail may be unterminated, or it may end in a preinstalled spade lug. If colored white, it typically may be used for splicing neutral wires in a device box, while leaving a pigtail free for connection to a device (such as a receptacle). If colored green, the assembly is intended to be used as a grounding pigtail, similar to the feedthrough <b>twist-on</b> wire <b>connectors</b> described in the previous paragraph.|$|R
