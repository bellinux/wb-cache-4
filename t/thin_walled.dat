The rotational querns that they invented had a stationary lower stone and an upper one rotated by a lever. Iron was obtained in greater quantities from locally available turf ores; its metallurgy and processing were improved, resulting in the manufacturing of stronger and more resistant tools and weapons.

However, recent advances in metallurgy have created steel tubing that is not adversely affected (or may even be improved) by high temperature welding.

Over the last 20 years pressure pipe systems made from Polypropylene Random Copolymers (PP-R) have been widely adopted by the plumbing and heating industry in numerous countries around the world. However, while over that period system components have been progressively improved, the basic plastic used has remained essentially the same. This is now set to change with the recently developed new generation of materials using a special “β-nucleation ” process, namely PP-RCT. This process enhances the crystalline structure which enables pipes produced from the material to operate at higher stresses at elevated temperatures.

40|$|Abstract. The {{increasing}} {{length of}} oil and gas transportation pipelines, associated with their construction and operating costs, has lead to the development of new steel grades with higher performance. The API 5 L- X 100 is a new high strength steel for pipeline applications which enables the use of <b>thinner</b> <b>walled</b> pipes, lighter to transport and easier to handle on site, allowing greater operating pressures and reducing overall costs. However, this steel grade has limited ductility. Since advantages largely surpass disadvantages, these materials are being seen adequate for earthquake risk areas and low temperature environment as in the Arctic region. X 100 grade is already used in northern Canada and is planed for Japan Sub Sea. Automatic metal arc welding on site is the most common method of welding onshore pipelines in steel grades X 65, X 70 and X 80. The use of high strength steels requires the development of new welding procedures with narrow specifications and the X 100 steel has limited weldability. Research is needed to develop appropriate welding procedures, avoiding typical metallurgical problems like cold cracking and toughness reduction in the weld area and to achieve high productivity and economical feasibility. This paper presents results on API X 100 steel grade welded by high power fiber lasers. Since these lasers are quite new in the market, an analysis of the laser source, as well as the beam/material interaction is made. The welds produced were investigated for both macro- and microstructural analysis and mechanical properties, contributing {{to a better understanding of}} the transformations induced in this material by the thermal cycle associated with laser welding...|$|R
5000|$|Rheinmetall {{designed}} an antitank cannon {{using their}} [...] "High-Low Pressure System" [...] that fired a standard general-purpose HE 8.1-cm mortar bomb {{which had been}} modified to function as an antitank round with a shaped charge. [...] Normally, a mortar bomb cannot be fired from a cannon, because their thin walls can not endure the high stress forces upon firing from a cannon. The 8.1-cm round was mounted on a rod which was fixed to a round steel plate with eight holes in it. A shear pin held the round to the rod. The round and the plate were fitted {{at the mouth of}} a cut-down cannon shell casing which contained two propellant bags. On firing, the pressure would build up in the shell casing, which along with the reinforced breech, acted as the [...] "High Pressure Chamber" [...] and bled out the steel plate holes at half the pressure to the <b>thinner</b> <b>walled</b> cannon barrel which acted as the [...] "Low Pressure Chamber". Unlike standard cannon, in which the propellant [...] "kicks" [...] the projectile out the barrel with an almost instant acceleration to maximum muzzle velocity, the Rheinmetall concept [...] "shoved" [...] the projectile out the barrel at a constantly increasing muzzle velocity. There was recoil, but nowhere near the recoil of the 5-cm and 7.5-cm antitank cannons being used at that time by the German forces, which required a heavy constructed carriage, and both a heavy and complex hydraulic recoil mechanism as well as a muzzle brake to contain the massive recoil on firing. The Rheinmetall solution required only a lightweight recoil unit and muzzle brake.|$|R

When measurement data were collected five different theory based methods were applied in order to determine critical loads. Cases where it was impossible to apply certain methods or some doubts about correctness of the results occurred were presented and analyzed. Moreover in cases where it was possible, the theory was equivalently transformed, in such a way to fit experimental data and calculate the critical loads...|$|R
