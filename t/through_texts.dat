5|$|Historically {{influenced}} by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period <b>through</b> <b>texts</b> such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. However, {{since the late}} 19th century the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a civil code based on {{a draft of the}} German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch; with the code remaining in effect with post–World War II modifications. Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature and has the rubber stamp of the Emperor. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.|$|E

5|$|At the school, Crawford was {{influenced}} by his housemaster, F. B. Malim, {{who presided over the}} archaeological section of the college's Natural History Society and encouraged the boy's interest in the subject. It is possible that Malim provided something of a father figure for the young Crawford. With the society, Crawford visited such archaeological sites as Stonehenge, West Kennet Long Barrow, Avebury, and Martinsell. It was also through the society that he obtained Ordnance Survey maps of the landscape, allowing him to explore the downs near to his aunts' home. He began excavation of a barrow near to Bull's Copse, thus attracting the attention of the antiquarian Harold Peake, who was then involved in compiling the Victoria County History of Berkshire. Peake and his wife lived a Bohemian lifestyle, being vegetarians and social reformers, and their ideas had a strong impact on Crawford. Under the Peakes' influence, Crawford rejected his religious upbringing in favour of a rationalist world-view based in science. Crawford gained an appreciation from Peake for the understanding of past societies through an examination of the geographical landscape rather than simply <b>through</b> <b>texts</b> or artefacts.|$|E

25|$|While the monist {{forces have}} led to a fusion between some of the goddesses (108 names are common for many goddesses), {{centrifugal}} forces have also resulted in new goddesses and rituals gaining ascendance among the laity in different parts of Hindu world. Thus, the immensely popular goddess Durga was a pre-Vedic goddess who was later fused with Parvati, a process that can be traced <b>through</b> <b>texts</b> such as Kalika Purana (10th century), Durgabhaktitarangini (Vidyapati 15th century), Chandimangal (16th century) etc.|$|E

500|$|Emaki, {{which are}} long paper scrolls {{telling a story}} <b>through</b> <b>texts</b> and paintings, came to Japan through {{exchange}} with the Chinese Empire around the 6th century and spread widely among the Heian aristocracy. [...] The subsequent Kamakura period was marked by internal strife and civil wars that fostered {{the rise of the}} warrior class. If the warriors of the bakufu preferred [...] "quick-moving narrative scrolls" [...] such as war tales or legends, the production of emaki at the Heian court subsisted. Pictures illustrating The Tale of Genji continued to be popular into the early Kamakura period and revived interest in the author, Murasaki Shikibu. Towards the end of the 13th century, a renewed interest in the refined culture of the Heian period led some artists to return to painting styles of the Imperial Court; many emaki were produced during this period.|$|E

One song was composed using a hook Madonna had sung in the studio; Diplo described it as [...] "super weird". Another one, later confirmed as [...] "Living for Love", had nearly twenty versions recorded ranging from a piano ballad to an EDM version. Ultimately Madonna and Diplo compromised on version midway between the two styles. Rechtshaid and British singer MNEK also joined their writing sessions, improving the song's verses. Diplo also confirmed another track, known as [...] "Bitch I'm Madonna", which he believed would push the lyrical boundaries for a pop song. Both Alicia Keys and Ryan Tedder confirmed working on the album, saying that they had contributed to the songwriting with Keys playing piano on [...] "Living for Love". Two other songs, [...] "Messiah" [...] and [...] "Devil Pray", were confirmed by Madonna in different interviews.|$|E
