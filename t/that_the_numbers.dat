The retention of one is also motivated by the fact that Berber languages near-universally use unity as a determiner.|$|E

Blomkvist tells Vanger's lawyer, Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff), {{that he needs}} help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander {{based on the work}} she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to investigate the notebook's content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. Henrik's openly national socialist brother Harald identifies Martin (Stellan Skarsgård), Harriet's brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, and Blomkvist marks Martin as a possible suspect. Salander's research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, committed the murders.|$|E
5|$|Himmler {{notified}} Fegelein by telegram on 1 August <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> killed {{were far}} too low. A few days later, Himmler issued regimental order no. 42, {{which called for}} all male Jews {{over the age of}} 14 to be killed. The women and children were to be driven into the swamps and drowned. Thus Fegelein's units were among the first in the Holocaust to wipe out entire Jewish communities. As the water in the swamps was too shallow and some areas had no swamps, it proved impractical to drown the women and children, so they were shot. Fegelein's final report on the operation, dated 18 September 1941, states that they killed 14,178 Jews, 1,001 partisans, 699 Red Army soldiers, with 830 prisoners taken and losses of 17 dead, 36 wounded, and 3 missing. The historian Henning Pieper estimates the actual number of Jews killed was closer to 23,700.|$|E

5|$|The {{advance to}} the Blackett design {{was the way the}} {{sighting}} head was aimed. Instead of dialling the parameters into the sight directly as in the CSBS, these inputs were dialled into a separate console. The console was equipped with repeaters for each of the aircraft instruments needed to operate the sight, like altitude and airspeed. The operator simply turned the dials on the console so their indicator arrows matched the readings on the instruments displayed in the same location, known as laying needle on needle. This eliminated the possibility <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> would not be changed as the bomber manoeuvred, but required so much manual working that a new crew member was introduced to operate the console, the bomb-aimer's mate.|$|E
5|$|By 16 July, Army Group South claimed 161tanks and 14 assault guns lost. Up to 14 July, 9th Army {{reported}} {{they had lost}} as total writeoffs 41tanks and 17 assault guns. These losses break down as 109 Panzer IVs, 42 Panthers, 38 Panzer IIIs, 31 assault guns, 19 Elefants, 10 Tigers and three flame tanks. Before the Germans ended their offensive at Kursk, the Soviets began their counteroffensive and succeeded in pushing the Germans back into a steady retreat. Thus, a report on 11 August 1943 showed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> of total writeoffs in Panthers swelled to 156, with only 9 operational. The German Army was forced into a fighting retreat and increasingly lost tanks in combat {{as well as from}} abandoning and destroying damaged vehicles. Across the entire Eastern Front 50 Tiger tanks were lost during July and August, with some 240 damaged. Most of these occurred during their offensive at Kursk. Between 600 to 1,612 tanks and assault guns sustained damage in the period from 5 July to 18 July.|$|E

5|$|P. (c.) tristis, the Siberian chiffchaff, breeds in Siberia {{east of the}} Pechora River and {{winters in}} the lower Himalayas. It is also {{regularly}} recorded in western Europe in winter, {{and it is likely}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> involved have been underestimated due to uncertainties over identification criteria, lack of good data and recording policies (Sweden and Finland only accept trapped birds).

It has a higher pitched suitsistsuisit song and a short high-pitched cheet call. It is sometimes considered to be a full species due to its distinctive plumage and vocalisations, being similar to P. s. sindianus in these respects. Nominate P. c. collybita and P. c. tristis do not recognize each other's songs. Pending resolution of the status of P.
