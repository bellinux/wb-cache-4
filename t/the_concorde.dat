5|$|Concorde also {{acquired}} an unusual nomenclature for an aircraft. In common usage in the United Kingdom, the type {{is known as}} Concorde without an article, rather than <b>the</b> <b>Concorde</b> or a Concorde.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, a new partial-access {{interchange}} was built at Wynford Drive {{to provide access}} between the parkway and <b>the</b> <b>Concorde</b> Place development. The new partial-access interchange was {{paid for by the}} developers.|$|E
5|$|Küchemann {{presented}} the idea {{at a meeting}} where Morgan was also present. Test pilot Eric Brown recalls Morgan's reaction to the presentation, saying that he immediately seized on it as {{the solution to the}} SST problem. Brown considers this moment as being the true birth of <b>the</b> <b>Concorde</b> project.|$|E
50|$|Reeves {{was signed}} by <b>the</b> Montreal <b>Concordes</b> in June 1983. He entered {{the first game of}} the season in relief of John Rogan and started the next game. He helped <b>the</b> <b>Concordes</b> win their first game of the season on July 16, {{recording}} four passing touchdowns in a come from behind victory over the Ottawa Rough Riders. He was released by <b>the</b> <b>Concordes</b> in September 1983 after quarterback Johnny Evans, who was injured before the season began, returned.|$|R
50|$|It {{can be seen}} in {{the table}} (just below) that the subsonic {{turbofan}}s such as General Electric's CF6 turbofan use a lot less fuel to generate thrust for a second than did <b>the</b> <b>Concorde's</b> Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593 turbojet. However, since energy is force times distance and the distance per second was greater for <b>Concorde,</b> <b>the</b> actual power generated by the engine for the same amount of fuel was higher for Concorde at Mach 2 than the CF6. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>Concorde's</b> engines were more efficient in terms of energy per mile.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Concordes</b> {{changed their}} {{name to the}} Alouettes, on the 40th anniversary of the {{founding}} of the original Montreal Alouettes.|$|R
5|$|The {{origins of}} <b>the</b> <b>Concorde</b> project {{date to the}} early 1950s, when Arnold Hall, {{director}} of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) asked Morien Morgan to form a committee to study the supersonic transport (SST) concept. The group {{met for the first}} time in February 1954 and delivered their first report in April 1955.|$|E
5|$|As {{it crosses}} Eglinton, the {{expressway}} passes a business park {{to the west}} and <b>the</b> <b>Concorde</b> Place commercial and condominium development to the east. The expressway begins to descend back into the East Don Valley. It passes beneath Wynford Drive and two railways (the CPR Midtown line and the CNR/Richmond Hill GO line) before reaching Lawrence Avenue East, {{one of the few remaining}} cloverleaf interchanges in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{introduced}} {{their first}} integrated circuit (IC) model, <b>the</b> <b>Concorde,</b> in 1971. The company had stopped manufacturing tonewheel organs entirely by 1975, {{due to increased}} financial inefficiency, and switched to making IC models full-time. Console models included the 8000 Aurora (1976) and 8000M Aurora (1977), which contained drawbars and a built-in rotating speaker. Spinet organs included the Romance series, manufactured between 1977 and 1983. In 1979, a Japanese offshoot, Nihon Hammond, introduced the X-5, a portable solid-state clone of the B-3.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Concordes</b> {{sported a}} 2-14 record in 1982 under head coach Joe Galat - the worst record in {{franchise}} history (just percentage points below the 1969 Als). <b>The</b> <b>Concordes</b> featured quarterback Luc Tousignant, the only Québécois quarterback to start a CFL game besides Gerry Dattilio. The dismal club also featured star collegiate running back David Overstreet who rushed for just 190 yards in six games before ending his season on the injured reserve list. <b>The</b> <b>Concordes</b> lost their last nine games of 1982. Other stars on the club included quarterback Johnny Evans, quarterback Turner Gill, slot back Nick Arakgi, running back Lester Brown, wide receiver Brian DeRoo, local kick returner Denis Ferdinand, defensive tackle Glen Weir, safety Preston Young, defensive end Gordon Judges, kicker-punter Don Sweet and linebacker William Hampton. The team gradually rebounded, even making the East final in 1985.|$|R
50|$|Tousignant's only {{professional}} {{season was}} the 1982 CFL season with <b>the</b> Montreal <b>Concordes</b> (which {{is part of}} the Montreal Alouettes franchise history.) He played in all of their 16 games, starting 5 times. He completed only 75 of his 174 passes, for 989 yards, 4 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. <b>The</b> <b>Concordes</b> finished <b>the</b> year 2-14.|$|R
50|$|Maggie is told by Harrison {{someone is}} framing him. He sends Maggie {{off in a}} limo, then plots to have <b>the</b> <b>Concorde's</b> {{departure}} delayed and the drone test reprogrammed.|$|R
5|$|Robert Kerman had {{years of}} {{experience}} working in adult films under the pseudonym R. Bolla, including the well-known Debbie Does Dallas. Kerman was recommended to Deodato for his previous film, <b>The</b> <b>Concorde</b> Affair, in which Kerman played an air traffic controller. Kerman went on to star in the Italian cannibal films Eaten Alive! and Cannibal Ferox, both directed by Umberto Lenzi. Kerman's girlfriend {{at the time was}} cast as one of the station executives, as the production needed an actress to be available in both New York City and Rome.|$|E
5|$|A {{barrister}} {{and former}} amateur racing driver, Mosley was a founder and co-owner of March Engineering, a racing car constructor and Formula One racing team. He dealt with legal and commercial matters {{for the company}} between 1969 and 1977 and became its representative at the Formula One Constructors' Association (FOCA), the body that represents Formula One constructors. Together with Bernie Ecclestone, he represented FOCA at the FIA and in its dealings with race organisers. In 1978, Mosley became the official legal adviser to FOCA. In this role he and Marco Piccinini negotiated {{the first version of}} <b>the</b> <b>Concorde</b> Agreement, which settled a long-standing dispute between FOCA and the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA), a commission of the FIA and the then governing body of Formula One. Mosley was elected president of FISA in 1991 and became president of the FIA, FISA's parent body, in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Like {{a number}} of other delta-wing {{aircraft}} designed to cruise at very high speeds, the Valkyrie included a droop-nose that allowed the pilots to view the ground during the nose-high takeoff and landing. <b>The</b> <b>Concorde</b> or Tupolev Tu-144 both used a design where the entire nose section was angled downward, including outer window panels, exposing interior windows that were more vertically angled. In the B-70 design, only the upper section of the nose moved down into a fixed lower section, and the outer window panels moved with it to become more vertical, at 24degrees slope. With the nose raised into its high-speed position, the outer windows were almost horizontal. A system that blew 600F air from the engines was used for both defogging and rain removal. The lower forward section included a radar bay, and production machines were to be equipped with a refueling receptacle on the upper surface of the nose.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, {{he began}} a {{successful}} 13-year career with Montreal, the second longest in team history. He played with the Alouettes until 1981 and with <b>the</b> <b>Concordes</b> three more years.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the demise}} of <b>the</b> <b>Concordes,</b> Etcheverry joined a group {{interested}} in bringing an NFL franchise to Montreal. He {{was one of the}} group's representatives at the 1988 NFL owners meeting.|$|R
50|$|Buggs {{played in}} the CFL from 1980 to 1982. In 1980, he helped the Edmonton Eskimos, led by quarterback Warren Moon, win the Grey Cup, which is the CFL's {{championship}} game. On April 20, 1982, he was signed by the Montreal Alouettes. Shortly after he signed the Alouettes folded and the franchise became <b>the</b> Montreal <b>Concordes.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Concordes</b> later released him on July 4, 1982.|$|R
5|$|While sailing off the Channel Islands on 23 April the British {{squadron}} {{came across}} a French squadron under Commodore Desgareaux consisting of the 36-gun Engageante, the 44-gun Pomone, the 36-gun Résolue and the 24-gun Babet. Warren chased and engaged them, leading the attack in Flora. When the Flora was badly damaged from the combined fire from the French ships, the remaining British ships came up in support, and forced the rear-most French ships, Babet and Pomone, to surrender. Melampus, Nymphe and Concorde gave chase to the fleeing Résolue and Engageante. Strachan in Concorde attempted to damage the rearmost of the French ships, Engageante, before pushing on to chase Résolue, but the Résolue dropped back to support the Engageante, damaging Concordes sails and rigging. With Nymphe and Melampus still too far astern, and unable to catch Résolue himself, Strachan engaged Engageante and after 105 minutes of fighting, forced her to surrender, while Résolue made her escape. <b>The</b> <b>Concorde</b> lost one man killed and 12 wounded in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|Air {{compression}} on {{the outer}} surfaces caused the cabin to heat up during flight. Every surface, such as windows and panels, was warm to the touch {{by the end of}} the flight. Besides engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is the nose, due to aerodynamic heating. The engineers used Hiduminium R.R. 58, an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft because of its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was , which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02. Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the metallurgical and fatigue modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing. <b>The</b> <b>Concorde</b> airframe was designed for a life of 45,000 flying hours.|$|E
5|$|Bruce McLaren Motor Racing {{was founded}} in 1963; Bruce McLaren was a factory driver for the Cooper motor racing team which competed in Formula One, {{the highest level of}} {{international}} single-seater competition. For two years the McLaren team had raced in the Tasman Series, a competition for single-seaters that ran during the Formula One world championship off-season, and in various sports car races. Bruce McLaren continued to race in Grands Prix (i.e. Formula One championship races) for Cooper, but by 1965 the team's performances were worsening and so he decided to build his own Formula One car to race the following year. Despite being a skilled engineer himself, McLaren enlisted Robin Herd to design the car. Herd was an aerospace engineer who had previously worked at the National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE) where he had been involved with <b>the</b> <b>Concorde</b> project. In September 1965 the M2A development car was completed. Powered by a 4.5 litre Oldsmobile V8 engine, it was used to test Herd's design ideas and Firestone's tyres. With McLaren still employed by Cooper, the McLaren team initially denied that they were building a Formula One competitor, claiming that the M2A was purely a tyre test bed.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Alouettes team (1946-1981) {{won four}} Grey Cups and were particularly {{dominant in the}} 1970s. After their collapse in 1982, they were immediately reconstituted under new ownership as <b>the</b> Montreal <b>Concordes.</b> After playing for four years as <b>the</b> <b>Concordes,</b> they revived <b>the</b> Alouettes name for the 1986 season. A second folding in 1987 led to a nine-year hiatus of CFL football in the city.|$|R
50|$|Steven Michael Alatorre (born September 3, 1959) is {{a former}} Canadian {{football}} quarterback who played for <b>the</b> Montreal <b>Concordes</b> of <b>the</b> Canadian Football League (CFL). He played three regular season games for <b>the</b> <b>Concordes.</b> On 22 attempts, Alatorre passed for 114 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. Alatorre signed with the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the CFL in 1982 and was traded to <b>the</b> Montreal <b>Concordes</b> before <b>the</b> start of the regular season. Due to an injury to Ken Johnson, Alatorre started {{the first game of}} the 1982 season. However, he was replaced by Luc Tousignant to begin the second half.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Concorde's</b> design can {{be traced}} to 1986, when {{designer}} Kevin Verduyn completed the initial exterior design of a new aerodynamic concept sedan called Navajo. The design never passed the clay model stage.|$|R
5|$|One of the {{youngest}} Concordes (F-BTSD) is on display at Le Bourget Air and Space Museum in Paris. In February 2010, {{it was announced that}} the museum and a group of volunteer Air France technicians intend to restore F-BTSD so it can taxi under its own power. In May 2010, it was reported that the British Save Concorde Group and French Olympus 593 groups had begun inspecting the engines of a Concorde at the French museum; their intent is to restore the airliner to a condition where it can fly in demonstrations. Save Concorde Group hoped to get F-BTSD flying for the 2012 London Olympics, but this never happened. The work for restoring F-BTSD to operating condition as of September 2015 is currently not very well known, and it is still being housed in Le Bourget as a museum exhibit. In 2015, the organisation Club Concorde announced that it had raised funds of £120million for a static display and to buy <b>the</b> <b>Concorde</b> at Le Bourget, restore it and return it to service as a heritage aircraft for air displays and charter hire by 2019, to coincide with the 50thanniversary of Concorde's first flight.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Concorde,</b> 300M, and Intrepid were {{discontinued}} in 2004. The all-new, rear-wheel-drive Chrysler 300 replaced <b>the</b> <b>Concorde</b> (and 300M) in late 2004 as a 2005 model.|$|E

50|$|After the 1981 season, the Montreal Alouettes folded. However, {{one year}} later in 1982 the CFL granted the city of Montreal a new {{franchise}} called <b>the</b> <b>Concordes,</b> which assumed <b>the</b> Alouettes' history and player contracts.|$|R
50|$|The Filton site {{is located}} on the former Bristol Aeroplane Company site, which was later used as the final {{assembly}} line for <b>the</b> British-built <b>Concorde</b> aircraft (<b>the</b> French-built <b>Concordes</b> were assembled in Toulouse, which is also now an Airbus site).|$|R
50|$|As a free agent, Silipo {{would sign}} with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League on July 11, 1981.
