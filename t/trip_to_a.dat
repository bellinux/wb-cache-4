5|$|After Gasketball 2012 release, Boxleiter and Wohlwend {{planned a}} celebratory road <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> game jam in Victoria, British Columbia. The game did not fare as expected, so Boxleiter used the two-day jam {{to create the}} core mirror {{reflection}} mechanics of what would become TouchTone, though it would take two years of sporadic work to finalize {{the remainder of the}} game. In TouchTone, the player monitors phone calls as part of a government surveillance program to find public threats. The story is told through a series of reflection puzzles wherein the player swipes the screen to reflect a beam around a room to its intended destination.|$|E

Ox and Volsius are in {{constant}} conflict throughout, with the former urging Georges toward hubris and the latter seeking to protect Georges from the influence. Ox appears to have won at the climax of the play, when Georges—attempting to work for the benefit of Altor, where overconsumption has deprived the planet of soil and other natural resources—leads a massive technological project to save the planet from burning by redirecting its water channels. The project backfires, and the planet explodes.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, Winton {{cancelled}} a <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Swiss {{holiday resort}} {{to go to}} Prague, having heard of a growing refugee crisis resulting from the German occupation of Czechoslovakia from a friend. His friend {{was working in the}} British embassy for the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia, which was already working to help adults escape from Czechoslovakia. When Winton learned that refugee children could not leave unless accompanied, he decided to arrange their evacuation to Britain. While the Winton evacuations later became known by the collective label of the children's Kindertransports, which were officially being organised elsewhere in other countries, no official Kindertransports had been arranged in Prague at that time.|$|E

Because the game was Virginia Tech's first <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> major bowl game, ticket sales were brisk. Texas took an early lead in the competition and led 107 at halftime, but Virginia Tech's defense shut out Texas' offense {{in the second half}} and Tech scored 21 unanswered points. In recognition of his achievements in the game, Virginia Tech wide receiver Bryan Still was named the game's most valuable player.|$|E
5|$|By late Friday night, {{they had}} laid {{out what was}} {{essentially}} a new airplane. The new design (464-49) built upon the basic layout of the B-47 Stratojet with 35 degree swept wings, eight engines paired in four underwing pods, and bicycle landing gear with wingtip outrigger wheels. A notable feature of the landing gear was the ability to pivot the main landing gear up to 20° from the aircraft centerline to increase safety during crosswind landings. After a <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hobby shop for supplies, Schairer set to work building a model. The {{rest of the team}} focused on weight and performance data. Wells, who was also a skilled artist, completed the aircraft drawings. On Sunday, a stenographer was hired to type a clean copy of the proposal. On Monday, Schairer presented Colonel Warden with a neatly bound 33-page proposal and a 14-inch scale model. The aircraft was projected to exceed all design specifications.|$|E

5|$|In November 2006, Jolie {{expanded}} {{the scope of}} the project—renamed the Maddox Jolie-Pitt Foundation (MJP)—to create Asia's first Millennium Village, in accordance with UN development goals. She was inspired by a meeting with the founder of Millennium Promise, noted economist Jeffrey Sachs, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where she was an invited speaker in 2005 and 2006. Together they filmed a 2005 MTV special, The Diary of Angelina Jolie & Dr. Jeffrey Sachs in Africa, which followed them on a <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Millennium Village in western Kenya. By mid-2007, some 6,000 villagers and 72 employees—some of them former poachers employed as rangers—lived and worked at MJP, in ten villages previously isolated from one another. The compound includes schools, roads, and a soy milk factory, all funded by Jolie. Her home functions as the MJP field headquarters.|$|E

5|$|The game's logo artwork {{was drawn}} by regular series artist Yoshitaka Amano. The kanji symbol {{used in the}} logo was drawn by Naora, who had {{designed}} the Shinra logo in Final Fantasy VII and its companion media. Naora specifically requested that he draw the logo due to this previous experience. To achieve the grittier atmosphere, Naora took a research <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Japanese military camp to learn what being a military cadet was like. The island of the Vermillion Perystilium {{was based on an}} offshore Japanese island he had visited prior to his involvement with the game, adding elements in-game such as an offshore ship wreck to symbolize his fear of the sea. He was also influenced by an incident where he saw a dead cat surrounded by other cats to portray the bond between members of Class Zero, and the game's themes, in promotional artwork.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{story begins}} on {{the outset of}} summer vacation. Hazumu's {{homeroom}} teacher Namiko Tsuki suggests Hazumu and her friends take a one-week <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small mountain village with a hot spring resort. Hazumu's grandparents reside in this town, and are two new characters introduced to the story. Three other female characters are introduced as possible love interests for Hazumu; two are {{the same age as}} her, and the third is the older landlady of the resort. The goal of the game is to pair Hazumu up with one of the five female cast of characters. The gameplay's main system comes from Hazumu's indecisive personality. If the player shows more interest in a particular character, the other characters get annoyed that Hazumu is ignoring them, which is displayed in a tension meter. The more Hazumu ignores a particular character, the higher the tension between that character becomes. This ensures Hazumu stays good friends with the possible love interests. In order to view the ending of a particular character, a certain amount of tension will have to be between the other characters, but this cannot be too great or the ending will not show.|$|E
5|$|Mickiewicz {{welcomed the}} Crimean War of 1853-1856, which {{he hoped would}} lead to a new European order {{including}} a restored independent Poland. His last composition, a Latin ode Ad Napolionem III Caesarem Augustum Ode in Bomersundum captum, honored Napoleon III and celebrated the British-French victory over Russia at the Battle of Bomarsund in the Åland Islands in August 1854. Polish émigrés associated with the Hôtel Lambert persuaded him to become active again in politics. Soon after the Crimean War broke out (October 1853), the French government entrusted him with a diplomatic mission. He left Paris on 11 September 1855, arriving in Constantinople, in the Ottoman Empire, on 22 September. There, working with Michał Czajkowski (Sadyk Pasha), he began organizing Polish forces to fight under Ottoman command against Russia. With his friend Armand Lévy he also set about organizing a Jewish legion. He returned ill from a <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> military camp to his apartment on Yenişehir Street in the Pera (now Beyoğlu) district of Constantinople and died on 26 November 1855. Though Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński and others have speculated that political enemies might have poisoned Mickiewicz, there is no proof of this, and he probably contracted cholera, which claimed other lives there at the time.|$|E

After Don pulls Megan away for an impromptu <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Howard Johnson's hotel in upstate New York, Peggy has to pitch to the Heinz executives without them and unsuccessfully tries to sell the Heinz executives on her concept. Frustrated, she leaves work, {{has a couple of}} drinks, and goes to see the film Born Free (1966). She sees a young man smoking marijuana behind her, partakes herself, and eventually gives him a hand job. She returns to her office to see Ginsberg arguing with his father. After being told off by Ginsberg for eavesdropping, she falls asleep in Don's office. She awakens to a call from Don, who seems alarmed for incomprehensible reasons. Don hangs up on her, and Peggy returns to her office. When Peggy asks about Ginsberg's life, Ginsberg initially claims to be a Martian, stating that Morris Ginsberg is not his father. Michael was born in a Nazi concentration camp and, after its liberation, Morris claimed him from a Swedish orphanage when Michael was 5 years old. Peggy returns home, affected by this story, and calls Abe. She tells him about Ginsberg and asks him to come over to be with her.|$|E
