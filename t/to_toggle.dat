5|$|Mad Max is a post-apocalyptic action-adventure game {{emphasizing}} vehicular combat, {{in which}} the player is the eponymous Mad Max (Bren Foster). According to its publisher, up to 60 percent of the game focuses on driving. Some weapons and tools, including flamethrowers and turbo boosts, are mounted directly onto the Magnum Opus, while others, such as a grappling hook and sniper rifle, are {{used in conjunction with}} the vehicle by Chumbucket, Max's assistant, or Max himself. Max's Magnum Opus, with its V8 engine and powerful ramming ability, can destroy enemies' vehicles and weaponry. When simultaneously driving and aiming, the game changes to slow motion to allow the player <b>to</b> <b>toggle</b> between targets. Although Mad Max primarily uses a third-person perspective, the player can switch to first-person view when fighting enemies while driving the Magnum Opus. Chumbucket repairs the car when instructed to do so or when the player exits.|$|E
5|$|One notable {{omission}} was {{the removal}} of the cutscene prior to the Psycho Mantis battle in which he reads the player's memory card and activates the vibration function of the player's controller if a DualShock is being used, as this scene involved the use of PlayStation-specific peripherals. The method for defeating Mantis was also changed from using the second controller to simply using the keyboard (regardless of whether the player was using a game controller or not up to that point). Other omissions include {{the removal of}} the eighth Codec frequency (140.07), which featured written commentaries by the developers, Meryl's alternate sneaking suit outfit, and the mission logs when loading a save file. However, the PC version adds the option <b>to</b> <b>toggle</b> moving and shooting in first-person view mode at any time regardless of difficulty setting, and players can now save their progress at any point without contacting Mei-Ling through the use of quick saves. On the VR training portion, all 300 missions, as well as the photoshoot mode, are available from the start, although the three unlockable preview trailers from the PlayStation version have been removed.|$|E

5|$|An {{enhanced}} PC version titled Cave Story+ {{was released}} by Nicalis on the Steam service on 22 November 2011. Cave Story+ features an alternative script that differs from the original English translation. This version contains all the additional modes from the WiiWare version, a remastered soundtrack, {{as well as the}} option <b>to</b> <b>toggle</b> the style of graphics between the classic style and that of the WiiWare version and the music of the original game, the WiiWare port, or the 3DS update. It also features an exclusive 'Wind Fortress' level. Recently the game got an update that added exclusive Machine Gun Challenge. The game was included as a bonus game in the Humble Indie Bundle 4 sale in December 2011, Humble Bundle 7 in December 2012, and was released on the Desura service in April 2012. On 19 January 2017, Nicalis announced a port of Cave Story + on the Nintendo Switch, which released on 20 June 2017. This version is packaged with a full-color manual for the game and a Mini CD containing arrangements of the game's soundtrack made in FamiTracker, a chiptune music tracker based on the Famicom's synthesizers. Additionally, GameStop purchases of the Nintendo Switch version include one of three keychains modeled after Quote, Curly, and Balrog.|$|E

25|$|Electric {{guitar and}} {{electric}} bass players who perform concerts may use electronic tuners built into an effects pedal, often called a stomp box. These tuners have a rugged metal or heavy-duty plastic housing and a foot-operated switch <b>to</b> <b>toggle</b> between the tuner and a bypass mode. Professional guitarists may use {{a more expensive}} version of the LED tuner mounted in a rack-mount case with a larger range of LEDs for more accurate pitch display. Many models let the user select reference pitches other than A440. On many electronic tuners, the user can select a different note—useful for, for example, dropping a guitar's tuning to a lower pitch (e.g., Dropped tuning). Some models are adjustable standards other than A=440. This is useful to some Baroque musicians who play period instruments at lower reference pitches—such as A=435. Some higher-priced electronic tuners support tuning {{to a range of}} different temperaments—a feature useful to some guitarists and harpsichord players.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the discontinuation of PSP, the Chinese electronics company Lenkeng released a PSP to HDMI converter called the LKV-8000. The device {{is compatible with the}} PSP-2000, PSP-3000 and PSP GO, but the AV cable packaged with it requires an adapter to plug into the PSP GO's port. Instead of component RCA plugs, the PSP's YPbPr AV signal is carried through a D-sub 9 cable that screws into the converter box, which then converts the signal from analog to digital and upscales it to 720p through HDMI. Lenkeng also released a variant of the LKV-8000 with a button allowing the user <b>to</b> <b>toggle</b> between 720p and 1080p. To overcome the problems of PSP games being displayed in a small window surrounded by a black boarder, the LKV-8000 featured a Zoom button on the connector itself. This allowed players to fill screen natively, without any need to use the television's zoom function. A few other Chinese companies have also released clones of this upscaler under different names, like the Pyle PSPHD42. The LKV-8000 and its variants have become popular among players and reviewers as the only means of playing and recording PSP gameplay in full screen.|$|E

The time unit is relative <b>to</b> the <b>toggling</b> frequency, and is usually limited by the HTOL setup to be in the range of 10-20Mhz.|$|R
500|$|Practice mode {{is a new}} {{addition}} to the game, allowing a player to practice certain sections of a song ("Verse 2," [...] "Chorus," [...] "Bridge 3," [...] "Gtr Solo 4," [...] etc.) on different difficulties and instruments. Practice mode gives the player the ability <b>to</b> <b>toggle</b> {{the speed of the}} notes (Full Speed, Slow, Slower and Slowest) and does not stop a song no matter how many mistakes are made. Players can play the bass guitar lines on most songs. On others, a rhythm guitar line is available instead.|$|E
500|$|The {{series has}} had a [...] "WWE Universe" [...] mode since SmackDown vs. Raw 2011 which replaces the career mode from {{previous}} games. The mode builds storylines, and integrates cut scenes and rivalries between wrestlers based on the matches that are wrestled. These cut scenes appear randomly before, during, and after the match. In WWE '12, championships {{was not able to}} be toggled on and off from most wrestlers. WWE '13 introduced the option <b>to</b> <b>toggle</b> on and off rivalries injuries and tag team changes also crowd reactions. WWE 2K14 was the last title to use the method of created arena before it was removed in WWE 2K15. In WWE 2K15, secret hints had to be unlocked through actions in this mode; they were 300 to collect. WWE 2K16 allows wrestlers to be branded by multiple promotions. WWE 2K17 replicates real television with a promo engine. WWE 2K18 has remade Universe Mode from scratch as a new goal system is put in place and draft system has been removed as player can reshuffle them.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{highlighted}} {{technical issues}} in the game. The eight door maze room {{was thought to be}} a bug, a software error, by two people at ZX Computing magazine. Because the game contains no reset feature they reloaded the game from cassette in order to continue playing. The player character's movements were criticised for being jerky and prone to stopping at infrequent intervals. One of Crash magazine's staff stated that the boy scout's movement to the left was quick; [...] "as if there's a force ten gale blowing to the left." [...] They added [...] "When any attempt is made to move right, all the moving characters on the screen slow right down." [...] In-game objects are removed from view when either the player character or one of the mansion staff move in front of them. When the player redefines the game's keyboard controls, allowing them to choose which keys move the boy scout during play, the pause key and music toggle key are not included. As a result it is possible to double-up movement controls with these two functions, effectively causing the game to pause and unpause or for the music <b>to</b> <b>toggle</b> constantly as the player moves in that direction.|$|E
50|$|This {{leads to}} the dither solution. Rather than predictably {{rounding}} up or down in a repeating pattern, {{it is possible to}} round up or down in a random pattern.

2500|$|The guitar {{controller}} for Rock Band, {{modeled after}} a Fender Stratocaster, {{is used for}} lead guitar and bass guitar gameplay. It has several features akin to Guitar Heros controller, as it features five colored fret buttons on {{the neck of the}} guitar (which correspond to on-screen notes), a strum bar, and a whammy bar. To use the guitar controller, players must hold the fret button that corresponds to the scrolling colored note on-screen while simultaneously pushing the strum bar. In addition, five smaller fret buttons are located further down on the neck. [...] These buttons can be used to play all notes in guitar solos (denoted by the note track turning blue) as hammer-ons and pull-offs, without the need to strum. The whammy bar can be used to distort the sound of held notes. A special effects switch can be used <b>to</b> <b>toggle</b> between five different guitar effects during solos and Overdrive periods (ranging from wah-wah, flange, chorus, echo, distortion, doubler, slap back echo, medium echo, and long echo), however, this switch was removed from the Rock Band 3 edition of the guitar. Overdrive for guitarists can be deployed by holding the controller in a vertical position or pressing the [...] "Select/Back/-" [...] button. The controller is offered in both wired and wireless versions. Rock Band games allow players to apply a [...] "Lefty Flip" [...] setting, supporting left-handed guitar players. [...] The second version of the controller, distributed with Rock Band 2, introduced quieter fret buttons, a more reliable strum bar, and optical sensor and microphone to help the player calibrate the video and audio output from their television/stereo system's setup.|$|E

40|$|Power {{dissipation}} in sequential circuits is due <b>to</b> increased <b>toggling</b> {{count of}} Circuit under Test, which depends upon test vectors applied. If successive test vectors sequences have more toggling nature {{then it is}} sure that toggling rate of flip flops is higher. Higher toggling for flip flops results more power dissipation. To overcome this problem, one method is to use GA to have test vectors of high fault coverage in short interval, followed by Hamming distance management on test patterns. This approach is time consuming and needs more efforts. Another method which is purposed in this paper is a PSO based Frame Work to optimize power dissipation. Here target is to set the entire test vector in a frame for time period 'T', so that the frame consists of all those vectors strings which not only provide high fault coverage but also arrange vectors in frame <b>to</b> produce minimum <b>toggling...</b>|$|R
