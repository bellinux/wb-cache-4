5|$|Following an {{alliance}} contracted in 1912, Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia {{declared war on}} the Ottoman Turkish Empire. <b>Their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to definitely expel Turks from Europe. The First Balkan War started on 8 October 1912 and lasted six weeks. Serbians reached Skopje on 26 October. The Turkish forces had left the city the day before. The Serbian annexation led to the exodus of many Turks: 725 Turkish families left the city on 27 January 1913. The same year, the city population was evaluated at 37,000 by the Serbian authorities.|$|E
5|$|For the 2010–11 season, the Rockets {{said they}} would limit Yao to 24 minutes a game, with no plan to play him on {{back-to-back}} nights. <b>Their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to keep Yao healthy in the long term. On December 16, 2010, {{it was announced that}} Yao had developed a stress fracture in his left ankle, related to an older injury, and would miss the rest of the season. In January 2011, he was voted as the Western Conference starting center for the 2011 All-Star Game for the eighth time in nine seasons. Injured All-Stars are usually required to attend the All-Star functions and to be introduced at the game, but Yao was not in Los Angeles because of his rehabilitation schedule after his surgery. Yao's contract with the Rockets expired {{at the end of the}} season, and he became a free agent.|$|E

5|$|Frederick grew {{up during}} a tumultuous {{political}} period as {{the concept of}} liberalism in Germany, which evolved during the 1840s, was gaining widespread and enthusiastic support. The liberals sought a unified Germany and were constitutional monarchists who desired a constitution to ensure equal protection under the law, the protection of property, and the safeguarding of basic civil rights. Overall, the liberals desired a government ruled by popular representation. When Frederick was 17, these emergent nationalistic and liberal sentiments sparked a series of political uprisings across the German states and elsewhere in Europe. In Germany, <b>their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to protect freedoms, such as the freedom of assembly and freedom of the press, {{and to create a}} German parliament and constitution. Although the uprisings ultimately brought about no lasting changes, liberal sentiments remained an influential force in German politics throughout Frederick's life.|$|E
5|$|In August 1835, Jefferson and Sarah {{traveled}} {{south to}} his sister Anna's home in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana; the plantation was known as Locust Grove. <b>Their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to spend the hot summer months in the countryside away from the river floodplain, for their health, but both of them contracted either malaria or yellow fever. Sarah {{died at the age}} of 21 on September 15, 1835, after just three months of marriage. Davis was also severely ill, and his family feared for his life. In the month following Sarah's death, he slowly improved, although he remained weak.|$|E
5|$|In June 1863, Hines led an {{invasion}} into Indiana with 25 Confederates {{posing as a}} Union unit in pursuit of deserters. <b>Their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> {{to see if the}} local Copperheads would support the invasion of John Hunt Morgan planned for July 1863. Traveling through Kentucky for eight days to obtain supplies for their mission, they crossed the Ohio River to enter Indiana, near the village of Derby, on June 18, 1863. Hines visited the local Copperhead leader, Dr. William A. Bowles, in French Lick, and learned {{that there would be no}} formal support for Morgan's Raid. On his way back to Kentucky, Hines and his men were discovered in Valeene, Indiana, leading to a small skirmish near Leavenworth, Indiana, on Little Blue Island. Hines had to abandon his men as he swam across the Ohio River under gunfire.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Ostrach, {{also called}} the Battle by Ostrach, {{occurred}} 20–23March 1799. In early March, the Army of the Danube pressed forward toward Pfullendorf and Ostrach, the former an imperial city in Upper Swabia and the latter a nearby village of 300belonging to the Imperial Abbey of Salem. <b>Their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to cut the Austrian line at Switzerland, preventing the Coalition use of Switzerland as an overland route between central and southern Europe. This would ostensibly isolate the armies of the Coalition in northern Italy and Germany, and prevent them from assisting one another; furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.|$|E
5|$|The Wallachian revolutionaries {{maintained}} ambiguous {{relations with}} leaders of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, {{as well as with}} the latter's ethnic Romanian adversaries in Transylvania. As early as April, Bălcescu, who maintained close contacts with many Romanian Transylvanian politicians, called on August Treboniu Laurian not to oppose the unification of Transylvania and revolutionary Hungary. In parallel, secretive negotiations were carried out between Lajos Batthyány and Ion Brătianu, which were in connection to a project of creating a Wallachian–Hungarian confederation. Although it drew support from radicals, the proposal was ultimately rejected by the Hungarian side, who notably argued that this carried the danger of deteriorating relations with Russia. Progressively, Romanian Transylvanians distanced themselves from the rapprochement, and clarified that <b>their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> the preservation of Austrian rule, coming into open conflict with the Hungarian revolutionary authorities.|$|E
5|$|Butler {{participated in}} a series of occupations, police actions, and {{interventions}} by the United States in Central America and the Caribbean, commonly called the Banana Wars because <b>their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to protect American commercial interests in the region, particularly those of the United Fruit Company. This company had significant financial stakes in the production of bananas, tobacco, sugar cane, and other products throughout the Caribbean, Central America and the northern portions of South America. The U.S. was also trying to advance its own political interests by maintaining its influence in the region and especially its control of the Panama Canal. These interventions started with the Spanish–American War in 1898 and ended with the withdrawal of troops from Haiti and President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy in 1934. After his retirement, Butler became an outspoken critic of the business interests in the Caribbean, criticizing the ways in which U.S. businesses and Wall Street bankers imposed their agenda on United States foreign policy during this period.|$|E

5|$|General (Polish: generalny, Latin conventiones generales), held {{in western}} Poland (Greater Poland) at Koło, in {{southern}} Poland (Little Poland) at Nowe Miasto Korczyn, in Masovia at Warsaw, in Red Ruthenia at Sądowa Wisznia (Sudova Vyshnia), and in Lithuania at Wołkowysk (Vawkavysk). The General Sejmiks were composed of delegates elected at the provincial sejmiks, and of Senators. <b>Their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> {{to agree on}} a position for the General Sejm (Sejm Walny) and issue instructions for the deputies on how they were supposed to vote during the General Sejm. The competences of the general sejmiks were defined by precedent and custom rather than law; on rare instances when external circumstances prevented a national Sejm from being convened (such as 1511, 1513 and 1577), the general sejmiks were seen as competent to legislate on national matters. In the 15th century some general sejmiks reserved the right to accept or reject national legislation. In the 16th century they were tasked with preparing drafts of legislation to be discussed at Sejms. Around the 17th century general sejmiks were mostly abandoned (with the exceptions of those in Royal Prussia, see Prussian estates); instead, provincial deputies would meet in special sessions during the Sejm proper.|$|E
5|$|In late 1959, James Lawson {{and other}} members of the NCLC's {{projects}} committee met with department store owners Fred Harvey and John Sloan, and asked them to voluntarily serve African Americans at their lunch counters. Both men declined, saying that they would lose more business than they would gain. The students then began doing reconnaissance for sit-in demonstrations. The first test took place at Harveys Department Store in downtown Nashville on November 28, followed by the Cain-Sloan store on December 5. Small groups of students purchased items at the stores and then sat at their lunch counters and attempted to order food. <b>Their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to try to sense the mood and degree of resistance in each store. Although they were refused service at both lunch counters, the reactions varied significantly. At Harveys, they received surprisingly polite responses, while at Cain-Sloan they were treated with contempt. These reconnaissance actions were low-key and neither of the city's newspapers was notified of them.|$|E
5|$|One {{animator}} {{was dedicated}} full-time during {{three years of}} the game's development to work out the boy's animations, including animations that showed anticipation on the player's actions or events in the game, such as reaching out for a cart handle as the player moved the boy near it. Jensen felt this was important as the character was always {{at the center of the}} player's screen, and the most important element to watch. Playdead included gruesome death sequences to highlight incorrect solutions and discourage players from repeating their mistakes. While they expected players to run the boy into numerous deaths while trying solutions, Carlsen stated that <b>their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to ensure death wasn't a penalty in the game, and made the death animations entertaining to keep the player interested. Carlsen noted several early puzzles were too complex for the game, but they would end up using a portion of these larger puzzles in the final release.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to cause significant disruption to oil refining in the Gulf of Mexico. Several hundred active wells went out of service, and drilling {{came to a halt}} for a few days during and after the cyclone's passage. One of Humble company's tenders saw three-quarters of its mooring chains compromised, which swung it around into an adjacent oil platform, causing $200,000 in damage (1956USD). The cost to downtime in production was greater than the damage Flossy created to the oil rigs. There was no loss of life. Due to the impact of Flossy on oil refining in the Gulf of Mexico, the American Petroleum Institute formed a committee called Fundamental Research on Weather Forecasting. <b>Their</b> <b>goal</b> <b>was</b> to use mathematical models and historic data to better predict hurricane formation and path. Studies went on into 1962, but no reliable forecast mechanism was found.|$|E
