30|$|Although bonding {{to tooth}} tissues {{has long been}} of {{particular}} interest in dentistry, {{the introduction of the}} acid etch method by Buonocore was revolutionary [1]. This technique enabled through the inherent enamel’s anatomy the utilization of adhesive penetration in terms of resin tags [2] in order to increase retention of the bonded material to the tooth. Therefore, the acid etch technique has found numerous applications in almost all aspects of contemporary dentistry, including operative dentistry [3], prosthodontics [4], pediatric dentistry [5], and orthodontics [6]. Although this technique has been widely adopted in all these dental fields, it is not free of complications and adverse consequences. Acid conditioning of dental enamel causes superficial tissue loss that ranges between 20 and 50  μm [7], while a possible removal of the bonded material or the bonded attachment (de-bonding) is associated with additional loss of dental tissue [7], enamel <b>tear-outs</b> [8], or enamel cracks [8].|$|R

These tests showed that successive local <b>tear-outs</b> due to local tensile overload in the RSI tile resulted in the interfacial fracture where the crack-tip opening angle, CTOA, of the SIP was related to initiation and intermittent stable crack propagation. Fractures in similar static and dynamic test specimens using densified LI- 900 RSI tiles occurred in the undensified regions of the RSI tiles.

5000|$|Multipart or {{multi-part}} stationery is {{paper that}} is blank, or preprinted {{as a form}} to be completed, comprising a stack of several copies, either on carbonless paper or plain paper interleaved with carbon paper. The stationery may be bound into books with <b>tear-out</b> sheets to be filled in manually, continuous stationery (fanfold sheet or roll) for use in suitable computer printers, or as individual stacks, usually crimped together. The purpose is to produce multiple simultaneous copies of a document produced by handwriting with a pen that applies pressure, such as a ballpoint pen, or with an impact printer. [...] The pressure of writing or impact printing on the carbon or carbonless paper transfers the content to the copy sheets. Depending upon requirements, up to typically four copies of the original can be made, with the quality and readability decreasing towards the bottom copies.This type of stationery can be used whenever multiple copies are required, of quality adequate for the purpose, usually noticeably inferior to, for example, laser-printed output. Typically a company may need a document such as an invoice to give to a customer (original), with a copy for their own accounting department (first copy), and possibly further copies for other purposes. The paper stock used is typically of low weight—thin—to transfer more printing pressure. The different copies can be on paper of different colour to distinguish them, and preprinted content may vary between copies.|$|E
40|$|Background The {{removal of}} well-fixed {{acetabular}} components following THA (total hip arthroplasty) {{is a difficult}} operation and could be accompanied {{by the loss of}} acetabular bone stock. The optimal method for fixation is still under debate. The aim of this pilot study was to compare the <b>tear-out</b> resistance and failure behavior between osseo-integrated and non-integrated screw cups. Furthermore, we examined whether there are differences in the properties mentioned between screw sockets and cemented polyethylene cups. Hypothesis <b>Tear-out</b> resistance and related mechanical work required for the <b>tear-out</b> of osseo-integrated screw sockets are higher than in non-integrated screw sockets. Patients and methods Ten human coxal bones from six cadavers with osseo-integrated screw sockets (n = 4), non-integrated (implanted post-mortem, n = 3) screw sockets and cemented polyethylene cups (n = 3) were used for <b>tear-out</b> testing. The parameters axial failure load and mechanical work for <b>tear-out</b> were introduced as measures for determining the stability of acetabular components following THA. Results The osseo-integrated screw sockets yielded slightly higher <b>tear-out</b> resistance (1. 61 ± 0. 26 kN) and related mechanical work compared to the non-integrated screw sockets (1. 23 ± 0. 39 kN, P = 0. 4). The cemented polyethylene cups yielded the lowest <b>tear-out</b> resistance with a failure load of 1. 18 ± 0. 24 kN. Compared to the screw cups implanted while alive, they also differ on a non-significant level (P = 0. 1). Osseous failure patterns differed especially for the screw sockets compared to the cemented polyethylene cups. Discussion Osseo-integration did not greatly influence the <b>tear-out</b> stability in cementless screw sockets following axial loading. Furthermore, the strength of the bone-implant-interface of cementless screw sockets appears to be similar to cemented polyethylene cups. However, given the high failure load, high mechanical load and because of the related bone failure patterns, removal should not be performed by means of <b>tear-out</b> but rather by osteotomes or other curved cutting devices to preserve the acetabular bone stock...|$|E

Twenty-five gusset-plate welded connections in VHS tubes with various weld lengths were tested under tension. The existing design rules for TO failure were examined by comparing their strength predictions with the test results from the welded connections in VHS tubes, previous test results from connections in SSHS and a combination of welded VHS tubes and SSHS. It was found that the existing design rules are inadequate, and five possible modifications have been examined. A modification of the effective net area and failure stress definitions is proposed.

40|$|Available {{test data}} on block shear {{behaviour}} of coped beams with double bolt-line connections are quite limited, and earlier investigations {{found that the}} test block shear capacities could not be accurately predicted by existing design rules which deal with this failure mode in an inconsistent manner. To address this, a comprehensive investigation focusing on the block shear behaviour of coped beams with double bolt-line connections was reported in this paper. The research commenced with 17 full-scale tests considering the test parameters of web block aspect ratio, out-of-plane eccentricity, connection rotational stiffness, and bolt stagger. Two specimens were found to fail by local web buckling, and the remaining 15 specimens failed by block shear. Three typical block shear failure modes were observed at ultimate load, namely, whole block <b>tear-out</b> (WBT), tensile fracture (TF), and tensile fracture followed by whole block <b>tear-out</b> (TF-WBT). The influences of the considered test parameters on the failure mode and block shear capacity of the test specimens were thoroughly discussed. The test results were then compared with existing design rules to evaluate the consistency and accuracy of the major standards, and {{it was found that}} these standards led to inconsistent test-to-predicted ratios and tended to be conservative. Summarising all available test data, including the current tests and those previously conducted by other researchers, a reliability analysis was conducted to further examine the level of safety of the major standards.

30|$|A {{three-dimensional}} finite {{solid element}} model for Japanese traditional post-and-beam connections was developed using the wood foundation method, which employed {{the concept of}} a beam on a nonlinear foundation. The wood foundation in the model was a three-dimensionally prescribed zone surrounding a nail shank in order to address the intricate wood crushing behavior induced by nail slip. Material models for the wood members and the foundation were developed based on the transversely isotropic plasticity from the software package ANSYS. The Japanese post-and-beam connection modeled was a ten-nail multiple connection with a mortise and tenon joint and is called the CPT (Corner Plate, T-shaped) connection. Details of the model development are presented.

However, the limitation of the model was found in simulating fracture failures such as wood splitting or nail <b>tear-out</b> from the wood.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{design of}} {{multiple}} bolted connections {{in accordance with}} Appendix E of the National Design Specification for Wood Construction (NDS) has incorporated provisions for evaluating localized member failure modes of row and group <b>tear-out</b> when the connections are closely spaced. Originally based on structural glued laminated timber (glulam) members made with all L 1 Douglas fir-Larch laminating lumber, the NDS provisions were confirmed by additional analysis, which indicates {{the applicability of the}} provisions to glulam with reduced design shear values. Due to the similarity to glulam in the grain orientation and layup strategy, laminated veneer lumber (LVL) is subject to similar failure modes. As a result, a study was initiated by APA – The Engineered Wood Association and the LVL industry, in collaboration with the Forest Products Laboratory (FPL) of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to evaluate if a reduced design shear stress is necessary for LVL under similar multiple bolted connection configurations. This paper describes the test results obtained from the study, which indicate that an adequate load factor exists for LVL multiple bolted connections without a reduction in the LVL design shear stress when designed in accordance with Appendix E of the NDS...|$|E

Tests were conducted on small samples to assess the performance and predictability of timber rivet connections in parallel strand lumber (PSL) and laminated strand lumber (LSL). The test joint configurations were designed to exhibit rivet fail-uressome combination of rivet yield and bearing defor-mation in the compositeas opposed to wood failure modes, such as block-shear <b>tear-out</b> or splitting. Results suggest that per-rivet design values should fall be-tween 1 and 2 kN, depending on species and density of the composite and load direction with respect to grain of the composite strands. Timber rivets performed better in LSL than in PSL and better in yellow poplar PSL than in Doug-las-fir or Southern Pine PSL; 40 -mm rivets in yellow poplar LSL gave roughly equivalent performance to 65 -mm rivets in yellow poplar PSL.

40|$|Block shear {{is one of}} {{the major}} failure modes for coped steel I-beams. While focus of {{previous}} studies on the block shear capacity of coped steel I-beam was mainly given to the connections with double clip angles, single-sided connections, which induce out-of-plane loading eccentricity, have not been adequately considered. Ten full-scale coped steel I-beam tests were conducted to examine the effects of two main test parameters, namely, out-of-plane loading eccentricity and web block aspect ratio (ratio of shear area to tension area). It was found that nine test specimens failed with tension fracture along the bottom bolt row of the web, and the remaining one failed in a whole block <b>tear-out</b> manner. Twisting of the web near the cope was observed for specimens with single-sided connection. More importantly, the test results showed that the out-of-plane loading eccentricity due to the single-sided connection did not have a detrimental effect on the block shear capacity of the specimens. Moreover, increasing the connection rotational stiffness could increase the block shear capacity. These effects are further discussed via a finite element analysis and a preliminary parametric study. Finally, the test results are compared with four major design standards. It is found that the Canadian Standards CAN/CSA-S 16 - 09, which gives a test-to-predicted ratio ranged from 0. 93 to 1. 17, provided relatively good predictions for the specimens with single bolt line layout, while the predictions by other codes are too conservative. For those specimens with double bolt line layout, the capacities are underestimated by all the considered standards. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|E
