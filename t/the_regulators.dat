5|$|After the lynching, {{friends and}} {{relatives}} of the Driscolls attempted to strike back at <b>the</b> <b>Regulators.</b> They obtained an indictment against many of <b>the</b> <b>Regulators</b> charging them with murder. <b>The</b> <b>Regulators</b> responded by obtaining their own Bills of Indictment against every person who had stood by and witnessed the lynching. With 125 people under indictment no witnesses could be found, and no jury could be formed, so the judge cleared the charges.|$|E
5|$|The core {{allegation}} of the Keating Five affair is that Keating had made contributions of about $1.3 million to various U.S. Senators, {{and he called}} on those Senators to help him resist regulators. <b>The</b> <b>regulators</b> backed off, to later disastrous consequences.|$|E

50|$|There {{were several}} {{different}} publications and petitions circulated {{to promote the}} end of taxation and other issues. A number of influential members of the area communities signed <b>the</b> <b>Regulator</b> Advertisement and <b>the</b> <b>Regulator</b> Petition, of which there were several versions of each.

5|$|A December 1988 audit by the FHLBB found Lincoln in {{violation}} of many regulations and in danger of default. The following month they ordered Keating to stop transferring cash from Lincoln to American Continental, which imperiled the latter's survival strategy and caused its stock price to nosedive. Keating tried to arrange junk bond deals with Michael Milken and place bets in the global currency markets to generate cash, but the moves failed and he lost $11 million in one month alone. Keating got Senators DeConcini and Cranston to pressure <b>the</b> <b>regulators</b> to let a sale go through, {{but this time the}} lawmakers were ignored.|$|E
5|$|McCain and Keating {{had become}} {{personal}} friends following their initial contacts in 1981, and McCain {{was the only}} one of the five with close social and personal ties to Keating. Like DeConcini, McCain considered Keating a constituent since Keating lived in Arizona. Between 1982 and 1987, McCain had received $112,000 in political contributions from Keating and his associates. In addition, McCain's wife Cindy McCain and her father Jim Hensley had invested $359,100 in the Fountain Square Project, a Keating shopping center, in April 1986, a year before McCain met with <b>the</b> <b>regulators.</b> McCain, his family, and their baby-sitter had made nine trips at Keating's expense, sometimes aboard Keating's jet; three of the trips were made during vacations to Keating's Bahamas retreat at Cat Cay. McCain did not pay Keating (in the amount of $13,433) for some of the trips until years after they were taken, when he learned that Keating was in trouble over Lincoln.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} notable moment in history for South Carolina was the {{creation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Regulators</b> in the 1760s, one of the first organized militias in the New World. The militia proposed ideas of independence and brought increased recognition to the need for backcountry rights in the Carolinas. This led to the War of <b>the</b> <b>Regulators,</b> a battle between <b>the</b> <b>regulators</b> and the British soldiers, led mainly by British Royal Governor William Tryon, in the area. This battle was the first catalyst in the American Revolution.|$|E

50|$|There is {{controversy}} over {{the invention of the}} first single hose <b>regulator.</b> <b>The</b> invention was motivated by an effort to bypass Aqua-Lung's patent on <b>the</b> double hose <b>regulator.</b> This patent involved the return of exhaust gas to <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> to reduce <b>the</b> differential pressure and therefore reduce work of breathing. <b>The</b> single hose <b>regulator</b> accomplishes this by relocating a portion of <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> to <b>the</b> point of exhaust, rather than routing the exhaust back to <b>the</b> <b>regulator.</b>|$|R

25|$|Operons occur {{primarily}} in prokaryotes {{but also in}} some eukaryotes, including nematodes such as C. elegans and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. rRNA genes often exist in operons {{that have been found}} in a range of eukaryotes including chordates. An operon is made up of several structural genes arranged under a common promoter and regulated by a common operator. It is defined as a set of adjacent structural genes, plus the adjacent regulatory signals that affect transcription of the structural genes.5 <b>The</b> <b>regulators</b> of a given operon, including repressors, corepressors, and activators, are not necessarily coded for by that operon. The location and condition of <b>the</b> <b>regulators,</b> promoter, operator and structural DNA sequences can determine the effects of common mutations.|$|E

50|$|High {{pressure}} {{gas from the}} supply enters into <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> through <b>the</b> inlet valve.

25|$|The size of {{the flame}} can be {{adjusted}} to a limited extent by the valves on the torch and by the regulator settings, but in the main {{it depends on the}} {{size of the}} orifice in the tip.

25|$|The {{safety of}} {{irradiation}} facilities is {{regulated by the}} United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency and monitored by the different national Nuclear Regulatory Commissions. <b>The</b> <b>regulators</b> enforce a safety culture that mandates that all incidents that occur are documented and thoroughly analyzed to determine the cause and improvement potential. Such incidents are studied by personnel at multiple facilities, and improvements are mandated to retrofit existing facilities and future design.|$|E
25|$|The severe floods of 2007 {{were the}} result of some 80 million cubic metres of {{rainfall}} falling on South Yorkshire on 25 June 2007. The level of the River Rother at Rotherham reached the highest level ever recorded, at , and <b>the</b> <b>regulators</b> were manned 24 hours a day in order to manage the water. However, there was a power failure at Canklow regulator, and the site had to be evacuated due to the threat posed by the possible breaching of the dam at Ulley Reservoir. The Meadowgate regulator was closed, and resulted in all four of the Rother Valley Country Park lakes flooding within the next 12 hours. Most of the car park and the watersports centre was also flooded, but water levels dropped over the next three days and little damage was caused. Assessment following those floods has led the Environment Agency to conclude that <b>the</b> <b>regulators</b> are expensive to maintain, and that they should be removed once some of the flood banks have been remodelled to ensure that the washlands fill and empty at the correct levels in a flood cycle.|$|E
40|$|Taming linear-regulator inrush {{currents}} Many older linear regulators and some regulators {{specifically designed for}} fast start-up require signif-icant inrush current at start-up to charge their output capac itors and to provide current to their resistive loads. The relation ship IInrush = COUT × VOUT/tRise predicts <b>the</b> <b>regulator’s</b> required input current at start-up for a given rise time, tRise, where COUT is <b>the</b> <b>regulator’s</b> output capacitance. With no inrush-control (commonly called “soft-start”) circuitry, IInrush is clamped to <b>the</b> <b>regulator’s</b> current limit, which is typically significantly higher than <b>the</b> <b>regulator’s</b> rated current. If the input power supply is current-limited or connected by long inductive traces, the voltage at <b>the</b> <b>regulator’s</b> input will droop, possibly below that of <b>the</b> <b>regulator’s</b> under-voltage lockout (UVLO) circuit. Figure 1 illustrates how this causes <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> to “stair step ” or ratchet its way up to regulation, shutting down momentarily while the input capacitor recharges, then starting up again. In the past, start-up problems were common for linear regulators and can still occur when the output capacitance seen by <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> is large. End-equipment designers need {{to take into account}} how linear regulators handle inrush current, especially if <b>the</b> selected <b>regulator</b> has no inrush-current control other than clamping to its current limit. Additional circuitry can be configured to manage inrush current for any regulator or converter. Simply by adding a FET and some passive elements following <b>the</b> <b>regulator’s</b> or converter’s output voltage, the designer can shape the FET’s turn-on characteristic and the output-voltage wave-form. For example, a designer has minimal control ove...|$|R

25|$|On May 6, 2010, the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted {{its largest}} intraday {{percentage}} drop since the October 19, 1987, crash, with a 998-point loss later {{being called the}} 2010 Flash Crash (as the drop occurred in minutes before rebounding).

40|$|We {{consider}} a two period model of optimal regulation of a ﬁrm subject to marginal compliance cost shocks. <b>The</b> <b>regulator</b> faces an asymmetric information problem: the ﬁrm knows current compliance costs, but <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> does not. Both <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> and <b>the</b> ﬁrm are uncertain about future costs. In our basic framework, <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> may not oﬀer {{payments to the}} ﬁrm; we show that <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> can vary <b>the</b> strength of regulation over time to induce the ﬁrm to reveal its costs and increase welfare. In the optimal mechanism, <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> oﬀers stronger (weaker) regulation in the ﬁrst period and weaker (stronger) regulation {{in the second period}} if the ﬁrm reports low (high) compliance costs in the ﬁrst period. Low cost ﬁrms expect compliance costs to rise in the future, and thus prefer weaker regulation in the second period. High cost ﬁrms expect costs to fall in the future and thus prefer regulation which becomes more strict over time. Thus <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> oﬀers <b>the</b> low (high) cost ﬁrms slightly weaker (stronger) regulation in the second period in exchange for much stronger (weaker) regulation in the ﬁrst period. We refer to our dynamic mechanism as “timing” the regulation. If <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> can make payments, then the optimal mechanism to some degree times the regulation as long as a positive cost of funds exists. If the cost of funds is high enough, then under the optimal mechanism <b>the</b> <b>regulator</b> will not use payments and only use our timing mechanismregulation design, environmental regulation design, hybrid policies, dynamic contracts. ...|$|R

25|$|The River Rother {{is managed}} by the Environment Agency to {{mitigate}} flooding in the Catcliffe and Rotherham areas, {{through a series of}} regulators and washlands. <b>The</b> <b>regulators</b> are used to hold back the flow of the river, and the washlands consist of low-lying land adjacent to the river which flood when the flows are held back.
