Through {{ten hours}} of {{interviews}} with the controversial former independent counsel, Wittes examines the role <b>that</b> <b>Ken</b> <b>Starr</b> played in implementing the independent counsel statute and investigating the Clinton scandals.

5000|$|As soon as I saw {{the camera}} lights, I {{instantly}} knew that everyone I loved would see {{this on the}} evening news I'd assumed the marshals would transport me to jail in secrecy. Now the entire world would get to see <b>that</b> <b>Ken</b> <b>Starr</b> had beaten me. My natural reaction was to duck my head and hide from the cameras, like I'd seen so many people do on television. But another thought hit me—no way would I give them that satisfaction.Mustering as much dignity as I could—which, given my metal accessories, was not much—I threw my head back, jutted my chin out, and walked along like I didn't have a care in the world.|$|E
5000|$|Variety {{magazine}} described Duda as [...] "a {{pit bull}} with a bureaucratic bone" [...] who [...] "follows subjects fearlessly and ventures into hostile environs (and) comes away, {{most of the}} time, with the information he wants to get." [...] Variety described Factor 8 as [...] "hard-headed journalism" [...] stating, [...] "one {{of the things that}} hits the viewer in 'Factor 8' is <b>that</b> <b>Ken</b> <b>Starr</b> spent more than $40 million trying to pin something on then-President Bill Clinton, and missed what Duda found via sheer leg work." [...] Duda experienced a significant amount of blow back in his native state of Arkansas {{as a result of his}} investigation, including claims of death threats, his tires being slashed, break-ins, files being stolen, and other things. Variety also reported on a lawsuit filed against Kelly Duda by Micheal Galster for the theft of intellectual property. After winning an injunction against Duda in January 2004, both parties reached a verbal agreement in April 2005 resulting in the lifting of the injunction.|$|E

5000|$|Quinn was {{critical}} of President Bill Clinton during the impeachment trial, stating that he had [...] "fouled the nest".

Regarding Whitewater Independent Counsel <b>Ken</b> <b>Starr,</b> she wrote: [...] "Similarly, independent counsel <b>Ken</b> <b>Starr</b> is not seen by many Washington insiders as an out-of-control prudish crusader. Starr is a Washington insider, too. He has lived and worked here for years. He {{had a reputation as}} a fair and honest judge. He has many friends in both parties. Their wives are friendly with one another and their children go to the same schools." [...] Harry Jaffe wrote in Salon that Quinn's condemnation of Bill Clinton's adultery rang hollow coming from someone who broke up the marriage of her boss Ben Bradlee before going on to marry Bradlee herself.|$|R
