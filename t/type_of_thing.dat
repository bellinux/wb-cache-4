25|$|For many {{classical}} philosophers, {{nature was}} understood teleologically, meaning that every <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> had a definitive purpose which fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims. Perhaps starting with Pythagoras or Heraclitus, the cosmos is even {{said to have}} reason. Reason, by this account, is not just one characteristic that humans happen to have, and that influences happiness amongst other characteristics. Reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature, such as sociability, because it is something humans share with nature itself, linking an apparently immortal {{part of the human}} mind with the divine order of the cosmos itself. Within the human mind or soul (psyche), reason was described by Plato as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts, such as spiritedness (thumos) and the passions. Aristotle, Plato's student, defined human beings as rational animals, emphasizing reason as a characteristic of human nature. He defined the highest human happiness or well being (eudaimonia) as a life which is lived consistently, excellently and completely in accordance with reason.|$|E

500|$|Rock critic Paul Williams {{saw that}} Anderle's idea to form Brother Records was reasonable, [...] "but {{the time it}} takes to put this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing</b> through the courts was not conducive to the {{production}} race that was important during this period of radical change in pop." [...] In the months leading up to Smiley Smiles release, a multitude of revolutionary rock albums were received by an anxious and maturing youth market as Wilson's image was reduced to that of an [...] "eccentric" [...] figure. From February to May 1967, this included Jefferson Airplane's Surrealistic Pillow, the Jimi Hendrix Experience's Are You Experienced, the Velvet Underground's The Velvet Underground and Nico, and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Up until this point, the Beatles were the only act that posed a competitive threat to the Beach Boys, and Wilson was concerned that if Smile followed in the wake of another critically successful release by the Beatles, that his album would be received with unjust comparisons. Once they released Sgt. Pepper, Wilson's race was effectively lost.|$|E
500|$|The cover artwork {{features}} {{porn star}} Janine Lindemulder {{dressed in a}} nurse uniform, pulling on a rubber glove. The band—semi-nude—appear on the back cover with Lindemulder preparing {{for some sort of}} injection. The trio was oblivious to the fact that Lindemulder worked in the porn industry until informed by producer Jerry Finn. The record company had delivered a stack of photos of potential cover girls, and the band members happened to pick Lindemulder. [...] "So it's kind of funny that they've been lumped in with Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit, who play up that kind of pimp lifestyle, because Blink is so not that," [...] remarked Finn. According to Mark Hoppus, they always intended to have a sexy nurse on the cover, and the women considered included [...] models from both Playboy and Janine's employer Vivid Entertainment. David Goldman was the photographer behind the shoot, held March 12, 1999, and did not know the trio before shooting. In 2012, he stated the glove was inspired by the album's working title. [...] "Up until the very last minute, the album was going to be called Turn Your Head and Cough," [...] he said. [...] "And that's why I {{came up with the idea}} of the glove.

40|$|Intuitively {{there are}} many {{different}} things that non-derivatively contribute to well-being: pleasure, desire satisfaction, knowledge, friendship, love, rationality, freedom, moral virtue, and appreciation of true beauty. According to pluralism, at least two different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> non-derivatively contribute to well-being. Lopsided lives score very low in terms <b>of</b> some <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that putatively non-derivatively contribute to well-being, but very high in terms <b>of</b> other such <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things.</b> I argue that pluralists essentially face a trilemma about lopsided lives: they must either make implausible claims about how they compare in terms of overall well-being with more balanced lives, allow overall well-being to be implausibly hypersensitive to very slight nonevaluative differences, or else adopt implausible seeming limits on what things lives can contain or how much they can contribute to overall well-being. Such problems about lopsided lives thus push us away from pluralism and toward simpler theories of well-being, toward hedonism in particular.

40|$|Recently, several {{philosophers}} {{have argued}} that nonreductive physicalism is a false, unstable, and incoherent position. I argue that the position these critics are attacking is a straw one. To help explain why let us distinguish three issues about which nonreductive physicalists might plausibly be thought to have an opinion: (i) ontological considerations about the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that exist at a world, (ii) issues involving the existence and nature of any dependency relationships between the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that exist at a world, and (iii) epistemological questions regarding {{the best way to}} describe, explain, or characterize the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>things</b> that exist at a world. I argue that reductive and nonreductive physicalists essentially agree with respect to the first two issues, but disagree with respect to the last issue. Nonreductive physicalists advocate a position that is ontologically or metaphysically reductive, but epistemologically or representationally nonreductive. Although this position could prove false on empirical grounds, it is neither unstable nor incoherent. ...|$|R

[...] Wieman noted at the time: [...] "The use of the protective face mask is becoming quite general, and the practice of players grabbing opponents by the masks is also becoming all too common. [...] Such a procedure is not a part of football.

2500|$|In Northern Europe, the new {{technology}} of the printing press was widely used to publish many arguments, including some that disagreed widely with contemporary ideas of nature. René Descartes and Francis Bacon published philosophical {{arguments in favor of}} a new type of non-Aristotelian science. Descartes emphasized individual thought and argued that mathematics rather than geometry should be used in order to study nature. Bacon emphasized the importance of experiment over contemplation. Bacon further questioned the Aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea that science should study the laws of [...] "simple" [...] natures, such as heat, rather than assuming that there is any specific nature, or [...] "formal cause," [...] of each complex <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>thing.</b> This new modern science began to see itself as describing [...] "laws of nature".
