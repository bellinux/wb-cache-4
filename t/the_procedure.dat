The identification division specifies {{the name and}} type of the source element and is where classes and interfaces are specified. The environment division specifies any program features that depend on the system running it, such as files and character sets. The data division is used to declare variables and parameters. <b>The</b> <b>procedure</b> division contains the program's statements.

5|$|Parents {{are assumed}} to have the child's best {{interests}} in mind. Ethically, {{it is imperative that}} the medical practitioner informs the parents about the benefits and risks of <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> and obtain informed consent before performing it.

Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child's best interests and may ethically perform <b>the</b> <b>procedure.</b> Equally, without a clear medical benefit relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform <b>the</b> <b>procedure.</b> Medical organization such as the British Medical Association state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform <b>the</b> <b>procedure</b> in such situations.|$|E
