[...] "Anyway, we've got to take it." [...] North was our direction. And to our surprise, and exceeding gladness, the road down this ridge proved to be a highway compared to what we had passed. In the open forest we had to follow it altogether by the blazes on the trees. But with all our eyes alert that was easy. The grade was down hill, so that we traveled fast, covering four miles an hour. Occasionally a log or thicket halted rapid progress. Toward the end of the afternoon sheep and cattle trails joined the now well-defined road, and we knew we were approaching a ranch. I walked, or rather limped the last mile, for the very good reason that I could not longer bear the trot of my horse. The forest grew more open, with smaller pines, and fewer thickets. At sunset I came out upon the brow of a deep barren-looking canyon, in the middle of which squatted some old ruined log-cabins. Deserted! Alas for my visions of a cup of cold milk. For hours they had haunted me. When Doyle saw the broken-down cabins and corrals he yelled: [...] "Boys, it's Jones' Ranch. I've been here.

When Doyle finally got the teams started Lee and Nielsen and R.C. and I went ahead to clear the road. Soon we were halted by thickets of pines, some of which were six inches in diameter at the base. The road had ceased to be rocky, and that, no doubt, was the reason pine thickets had grown up on it, The wagon kept right at our heels, and many times had to wait. We cut a way through thickets, tore rotten logs to pieces, threw stumps aside, and moved windfalls. Brawny Nielsen seemed ten men in one! What a swath he hacked with his big axe! When I rested, which circumstance grew oftener and oftener, I had to watch Nielsen with his magnificent swing of the axe, or with his mighty heave on a log.

40|$|Abstract—Energy {{conservation}} {{is a global}} concern nowadays and it is widely expected that energy cost will continuously increase in the near future. The design of the Internet, unfortunately, has not taken energy issues into consideration at the very beginning. There are emerging studies on reducing Internet energy footprint. These studies aim at turning network components such as line cards or routers into sleeping modes. We make an observation that different traffic volumes on links result in different energy consumption, even without <b>turning-off</b> network devices. As such, we {{for the first time}} design a green Internet traffic routing scheme; and it is orthogonal to those <b>turning-off</b> network components schemes. There can be many design choices for our green routing schemes. As an example, an optimization problem can be formulated where we centralized compute routing paths to minimize the overall energy consumption. Such approach, however, requires to deploy additional protocols for the Internet. In this paper, we propose a hop-by-hop routing scheme. Such scheme can be easily incorporated into current OSPF protocol. We solve many challenges. First, we present a power model to quantify link rate and power consumption. We validate our model using real world experiments. Second, unlike centralized computing, a key challenge for hop-by-hop computing is to avoid routing loops. We thus design green routing algorithms that are isotonic and guarantee that no loop will be formulated. Third, hop-by-hop routing without loops does not naturally lead to minimized energy consumption. Therefore, we develop a set of enhanced algorithms that substantially improve the performance. Fourth, a “green” path may degrade QoS performance such as end-to-end delay. We study this problem and develop an algorithm that co-considers energy conservation and path stretch. We comprehensively evaluate our algorithms through simulations on synthetic and real topologies and traffic traces. We show that with green routing, we can save the power that is consumed by line cards for as much as 50 %. I...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the early}} {{embryonic}} cell cycle, exit from M phase is immediately followed by entry into S phase without an intervening gap phase. To understand the regulatory mechanisms for the cell cycle transition from M to S phase, we examined dependence on Cdc 2 inactivation of cell-cycle events occurring during the M-S transition period, using Xenopus egg extracts {{in which the}} extent of Cdc 2 inactivation at M phase exit was quantitatively controlled. The result demonstrated that MCM binding to and the initiation of DNA replication of nuclear chromatin occurred depending on the decrease of Cdc 2 activity to critical levels. Similarly, we found that Cdc 2 inhibitory phosphorylation and cyclin B degradation were turned on and off, respectively, depending on the decrease in Cdc 2 activity. However, their sensitivity to Cdc 2 activity was different, with the turning-on of Cdc 2 inhibitory phosphorylation occurring at higher Cdc 2 activity levels than the <b>turning-off</b> of cyclin B degradation. This means that, when cyclin B degradation ceases at M phase exit, Cdc 2 inhibitory phosphorylation is necessarily activated. In the presence of constitutive synthesis of cyclin B, this condition favors the occurrence of the Cdc 2 inactivation period after M phase exit, thereby ensuring progression through S phase. Thus, M phase exit and S phase entry are coordinately regulated by the Cdc 2 activity level in the early embryonic cell cycle...|$|E

This technique utilizes power semiconductors like insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) to control the arc current and voltage with a high accuracy in time domain. The free recovery condition was created by switching-on an IGBT connected in parallel with the arc device to investigate decaying process of the arc plasma under gas flow condition. Then, the quasi-transient recovery voltage (quasi-TRV) was intentionally applied between the electrodes in the arc device under the free recovery condition by <b>turning-off</b> the IGBT again, to study the re-ignition process of the arc plasma. At the same time, the arc behavior in a nozzle was observed by a high speed video camera at a frame rate of 200, 000 fps.

The recent rise in microbial drug resistance {{is a growing}} challenge for future therapy of bacterial infections. Increased prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is an outcome of evolution via natural selection. However, the built-in design feature of bacteria to transfer DNA containing antibiotic resistance both within the same species and across species is the main culprit for the spread of drug resistance. One of the main factors driving the rise of drug resistant microbes is the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes present on mobile plasmids between donor and recipient cells via the mechanism of conjugation. In order to combat microbial drug resistance, novel strategies {{need to be developed}} to block such transmission of antibiotic resistance. In this work, the gene regulatory components involved in transfer of tetracycline resistance confers plasmid pCF 10 between plasmid-carrying donor cells and plasmid-deficient recipient cells in bacterium Enterococcus faecalis is investigated. In the native state the donor cell exists in an OFF or conjugation-incompetent state. A pheromone released by the recipient cells serves as the chemical trigger for switching the donor cell from OFF to an ON or conjugation-competent state. The onset of conjugation is tightly regulated via multi-layered regulation offered by two-key genes prgQ and prgX present on pCF 10 in response to the pheromone secreted by recipient cells. Using mathematical modeling and experimentation, we describe a novel mechanism of gene-regulation due to transcriptional interference and sense-antisense RNA interaction as a result of convergent transcription in the prgX/prgQ operon. We demonstrate that such a multi-layered gene-regulatory mechanism confers the system a bistable genetic switch controlling conjugative gene transfer between donor and recipient cells. A similar regulatory advantage offered by convergent transcription in attributing a bistable switch-like behavior in the scbA-scbR operon controlling antibiotic production in S. coelicolor is also investigated. Both mathematical model and experiments demonstrate that donor cells also control response to pheromone by changing the number of copies of pCF 10 plasmid inside the cell. Cells with higher copies show increased robustness of the bistable switch and lower sensitivity to pheromone. Once bistable genetic-switch is ON, expression of genes encoding various proteins involved in the transfer of the plasmid are induced, however, this also causes production of an inhibitor of conjugation, thus giving rise to negative feedback loop which causes the donor to return to OFF state. Modeling and experimental analysis of dynamic response to induction indicate that this negative feed-back loop causes a brief surge of expression of the entire operon. We show that the inhibitor signaling peptide for pCF 10 based system, acts as quorum-sensing signal with the role of <b>turning-OFF</b> conjugation at a population-wide scale. An interplay of positive and negative feedback loops allows the donor cell to quickly transition between ON and OFF states and is critical both for the transfer of plasmid and survival of the cell. Studying both the turning-ON and <b>turning-OFF</b> mechanisms of the switch allows identification of potential drug targets for blocking transmission of antibiotic resistance for use in future therapy...|$|E
40|$|Sheep {{in western}} Queensland have been {{predominantly}} reared for wool. When wool prices became depressed {{interest in the}} sheep meat industry, increased. For north west Queensland producers, opportunities may exist to participate in live sheep and meat export to Asia. A simulation model was developed to determine whether this sheep producing area has the capability to provide sufficient numbers of sheep under variable climatic conditions while sustaining the land resources. Maximum capacity for sustainability of resources (as described by stock numbers) was derived from an in-depth study of the agricultural and pastoral potential of Queensland. Decades of sheep production and climatic data spanning differing seasonal conditions were collated for analysis. A ruminant biology model adapted from Grazplan was used to simulate pregnancy rate. Empirical equations predict mortalities, marking rates, and weight characteristics of sheep of various ages from simple climatic measures, stocking rate and reproductive status. The initial age structure of flocks was determined by running the model for several years with historical climatic conditions. Drought management strategies such as selling a proportion of wethers progressively down to two-tooth and oldest ewes were incorporated. Management decisions such as time of joining, age at which ewes were cast-for-age, wether turn-off age and <b>turning-off</b> rate of lambs vary with geographical area and can be specified at run time. The model is run for sequences of climatic conditions generated stochastically from distributions based on historical climatic data correlated in some instances.

40|$|Sensory {{transcription}} networks generally control {{rapid and}} reversible gene expression responses to external stimuli. Developmental transcrip-tion networks carry out slow and irreversible temporal programs of gene expression during development. It {{is important to}} understand the design principles that underlie the structure of sensory and developmental tran-scription networks. Cascades, which are chains of regulatory reactions, are a basic structural element of transcription networks. When comparing databases of sensory and developmental transcription networks, a strik-ing difference is found in the distribution of cascade lengths. Here, we suggest that delay times in the responses of the network present a design constraint that influences the network architecture. We experimentally studied the response times in simple cascades constructed of well-charac-terized repressors in Escherichia coli. Accurate kinetics at high temporal resolution was measured using green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporters. We find that transcription cascades can show long delays of about one cell-cycle time per cascade step. Mathematical analysis suggests that such a delay is characteristic of cascades that are designed to minimize the response times for both turning-on and <b>turning-off</b> gene expression. The need to achieve rapid reversible responses in sensory transcription net-works may help explain the finding that long cascades are very rare in databases of E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae sensory transcription net-works. In contrast, long cascades are common in developmental transcrip-tion networks from sea urchin and from Drosophila melanogaster. Response delay constraints are likely to be less important for developmental net-works, since they control irreversible processes on the timescale of cell-cycles. This study highlights a fundamental difference between the archi-tecture of sensory and developmental transcription networks...|$|E

Repetitive afterdischarge is very often superimposed on the plateau. Voltage-clamp experiments with the axons treated with DDT and with DDT plus tetrodotoxin or saxitoxin have revealed the following: DDT markedly slows the <b>turning-off</b> process of peak transient current and suppresses the steady-state current. The falling {{phase of the}} peak transient current in the DDT-poisoned axon is no longer expressed by a single exponential function as in normal axons, but by two or more exponential functions with much longer time constants.

The insecticide DDT is known to exert two major effects on nerve, namely the initiation of repetitive afterdischarge and the prolongation of an action potential. The repetitive discharge has long been known to occur in sensory, central, and motor nervous systems in DDT-poisoned insects, and is directly responsible for the symptoms of DDT poisoning; i. e. hyperexcitability, ataxia, and convulsion (Roeder and Weiant, 1948; Yamasaki and Ishii...|$|E

CPP analysis shows important new feature. χeCP values increase by ~ 3 times (from minimum level ~ 0. 1 m 2 /s inside r/a < 0. 4 either by variation of the resonance position at the same off-axis power or by increase of power level. In all cases stronger redistribution (increase of wideness) of Te(r) /Te(0) profile (normalized to OH level) leads to the increase of χeCP. Probably, χeCP ≈ 0. 1 m 2 /s corresponds to some “optimal ” profile of safety factor q with low shear zone and q(0) slightly above 1; χeCP values rise under higher values q(0). Results of HPP/CPP study at LHD low density discharges show that HPP/CPP propagate in non-diffusive manner. In contrast, purely diffusive HPP (χeHP ≈ 1. 5 m 2 /s at 0. 2 < r/a < 0. 4) is observed in some LHD shots with moderate density and NBI power.

40|$|This work {{presents}} different novel {{gate drive}} unit (GDU) concepts for IGBT and reverse conducting IGBT (RC-IGBT). They have been experimentally tested with medium voltage class IGBT modules (1200 [...] . 1700 V/ 650 … 1400 A) and a RC-IGBT module (1200 V/ 200 A). The switching behaviour of the RC-IGBT was investigated, {{and a new}} trigger pulse pattern to drive the RC-IGBT was developed, designed and implemented. The experimental {{results showed that the}} switching losses were reduced by 20 % in the RC-IGBT compared to the switching losses of a standard diode. Two novel schemes are introduced to estimate the collector current through the IGBT, based on the measurement of the voltage across the internal stray inductance of the IGBT module. Furthermore, a GDU concept was derived to balance the on-state collector currents of parallel-connected IGBTs, reducing the current imbalance to 5 %. Also, a new fast short circuit protection method (FSCP) for IGBT modules was developed, designed and implemented in another GDU, allowing <b>turning-off</b> the considered IGBT in less than 1 μs, reducing the IGBT stress. Another scheme implemented in a GDU features an improved gate current switching profile of the IGBT, which reduces the switching losses by 25 % compared to the standard switching method. In order to reduce the conduction losses, a GDU with an increased turn-on gate-emitter voltage (larger than 20 V) was investigated. In the investigated IGBT, the on-state losses were reduced by 18 % when a gate-emitter voltage of 35 V is used compared to when a gate-emitter voltage of 15 V is used. All these new GDU concepts have been implemented with a simple and inexpensive electronic circuitry, which is an important feature for a possible industrial implementation...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{methodology}} is to achieve a tool, which generates generic load cases for commercial vehicles. These are required for the future conceptual design of energy and thermal management. Fuel and Gas are continuously getting more expensive for years. To save fuel and costs the vehicles should be optimized. Commercial vehicles are used for many different application purposes. The load cases are just as well varying for different purposes. For example, {{it is not possible}} to compare the load conditions between a long distance transport vehicle with a garbage collection truck. The first of them is used in a stationary, the second one in a stop and go purpose. Specific load cases have to indicate those differences and build up a basis for the future design of the thermal and energy management of power train and auxiliary aggregates. First of all one must collect the real load cases, e. g. via GPS, and prepare them by an innovative method. The load cases are analyzed by their different uses. The working and driving load profile have to distinguish. The Engine can be used in a different way. Some of the drive auxiliaries are <b>turning-off</b> and those for stationary work are turning-on. During the second step the particular load case would be evaluated by its statistical frequency distribution. In the next step the chronological sequence of individual load cases would be considered. It will be analyzed for the length of acceleration or braking sequences. Afterwards the base, average and peak load are analyzed, to show the utilization of this vehicle. The load cases will be completed. Several load components are generated off a statistical evaluation under consideration of the weighting of the load cases. The prepared areas from the above mentioned steps also included in the load components results. In turn these components are used to compose the specific reference load profile. That is the basic of the simulations surroundings. ...|$|E
