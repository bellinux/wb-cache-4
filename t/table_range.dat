The river initially flows south then west past the Sir William Thompson Range then veers north through the mostly uninhabited country. Flowing past Hamilton Hill the river then heads east past Wattle Hill and runs parallel with the Goddard Hills forming the northern border of Iron Range National Park. The river finally discharges into Weymouth Bay and onto the Coral Sea. From source to mouth, the Pascoe River is joined by eight tributaries including the Little Pascoe River; descending 243 m over its 119 km course.|$|E

40|$|Perturbation of {{external}} neutron source can cause significant local power changes transformed into undesired safety-related events in an accelerator driven system. Therefore for the accurate design of MYRRHA sub-critical core {{it is important}} to evaluate the uncertainty of power responses caused by the uncertainties in nuclear reaction models describing the particle transport from primary proton energy down to the evaluated nuclear data <b>table</b> <b>range.</b> The calculations with a set of models resulted in quite low uncertainty on the local power caused by significant perturbation of primary neutron yield from proton interactions with lead and bismuth isotopes. The considered accidental event of prescribed proton beam shape loss causes drastic increase in local power but does not practically change the total core thermal power making this effect difficult to detect. In the same time the results demonstrate a correlation between perturbed local power responses in normal operation and misaligned beam conditions indicating that generation of covariance data for proton and neutron induced neutron multiplicities for lead and bismuth isotopes is needed to obtain reliable uncertainties for local power responses...|$|E
40|$|The Yale stellar {{evolution}} code {{has been}} modified {{to use the}} OPAL equation of state tables (Rogers 1994). Stellar models and isochrones were constructed for low metallicity systems (- 2. 8 < [Fe/H] < - 0. 6). Above M∼ 0. 7, the isochrones {{are very similar to}} those which are constructed using an equation of state which includes the analytical Debye-Huckel correction at high temperatures. The absolute magnitude of the main sequence turn-off () with the OPAL or Debye-Huckel isochrones is about 0. 06 magnitudes fainter, at a given age, than derived from isochrones which do not include the Debye-Huckel correction. As a consequence, globular clusters ages derived using are reduced by 6 [...] 7 % as compared to the ages determined from the standard isochrones. Below M∼ 0. 7, the OPAL isochrones are systematically hotter (by approximately 0. 04 in B-V) at a given magnitude as compared to the standard, or Debye-Huckel isochrones. However, the lower mass models fall out of the OPAL <b>table</b> <b>range,</b> and this could be the cause of the differences in the location of the lower main-sequences.
