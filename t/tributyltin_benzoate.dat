40|$|A new organotin monomer, p-acryloamino tibutyltin benzoate, {{has been}} {{synthesized}} by {{the reaction of}} p-amino <b>tributyltin</b> <b>benzoate</b> and acryloyl chloride {{in the presence of}} dry pyridine. The monomer is polymerized by free radical polymerization using azobisisobutyronitrile as initiator in dimethylformamide and 1 - 4 dioxane at 55 +/- 0. 1 degrees C. The monomer and the unfractionated homopolymer have been characterized by tin analysis, solubility, i. r. and NMR spectral studies and viscosity measurements. The thermal properties were examined by thermogravimetry (TG), and differential thermal analysis (DTA). Biotoxicity testing of the premonomer, monomer and homopolymer was performed with two bacterial and one larval species. The antifouling property of the homopolymer was tested in a marine environment. The newly developed monomer and its homopolymer were compared with tributyltin acrylate (TBTA), tributyltin methacrylate (TBTMA), tributyltin alpha-chloroacrylate (TCA) and alpha-methyl p-acryloxy <b>tributyltin</b> <b>benzoate</b> (MATB) and their homopolymers...|$|E
40|$|This is {{to inform}} you that the Environmental Protection Agency (hereafter {{referred}} to as EPA or the Agency) has completed its review of the available data and public comments received related to the preliminary risk assessments for the antimicrobial tributyltin derivatives, (bis) tributyltin oxide, <b>tributyltin</b> <b>benzoate,</b> and tributyltin maleate (collectively known as “tributyltin ” or “TBT”). Based on its review, EPA is now releasing its Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) and risk management decision for tributyltin. The enclosed Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) document was approved on June 30, 2008. A Notice of Availability will be published in the Federal Register announcing the release of the RED. The RED and supporting risk assessments for tributyltin are available to the public on the U. S. Federal Government website www. regulations. gov. The docket is EPA-HQ-OPP- 2008 - 0171. The tributyltin RED was developed through EPA’s public participation process, described in the Federal Register on September 10, 2004, which provides opportunities for public involvement in the Agency’s pesticide tolerance reassessment and reregistration programs. Developed in partnership with USDA and with input from EPA’s advisor...|$|E
