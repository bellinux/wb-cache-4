50|$|One of {{the domains}} where the <b>typometer</b> was {{most widely used}} was the {{editorial}} offices of newspapers and magazines, where it was used along with other tools such as tracing paper and linen testers to define {{the layout of the}} pages of the publications, until the 1980s.|$|E

50|$|<b>Typometers</b> were {{initially}} {{made of wood}} or metal (in later times, of transparent plastic or acetate), and were produced in diverse shapes and sizes. Some of them presented several scales {{that were used to}} measure the properties of the text. Each scale corresponded with a type size or with a leading unit, if line blocks were divided by blank spaces. However, <b>typometers</b> could not be used to measure certain computer-generated type sizes, that could be set in fractions of points.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{technological}} advancements in desktop publishing, {{that allow for}} a greater precision when setting the type size of texts, <b>typometers</b> have disappeared from most graphic design related professions. It keeps being used, even today, by traditional printers who still employ type metal.|$|R
50|$|However, Fournier's {{prototype}} {{presented a}} major disadvantage, because its system of measures {{was very difficult}} to compare with the royal inches (pouces de roi) that were commonly used in France at the time. For this reason, French printer François-Ambroise Didot (1730-1804) created a simplified system, which he called <b>typometer,</b> and that he based on the pied du roi. This invention was first described in the book Essai de fables nouvelles, by Pierre Didot, François-Ambroise's son.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though these}} units {{are all very}} small, across a line of print they add up quickly. Confusions such as {{resetting}} text originally in type of one unit in type of another will result in words moving from one line to the next, resulting {{in all sorts of}} typesetting errors (viz. rivers of white, widows and orphans, disrupted tables, and misplaced captions). Before the popularization of desktop publishing, type measurements were carried by using a tool called <b>typometer.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>typometer</b> is a ruler {{which is}} usually divided in typographic points or ciceros on one of its sides and in centimeters or {{millimeters}} on the other, which was traditionally used in the graphic arts to inspect the measures of typographic materials. The most developed typometers could also measure the type size of a particular typeface, the leading of a text, the width of paragraph rules and other features of a printed text. This way, designers could study and reproduce the layout of a document.|$|E
