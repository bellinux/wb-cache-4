25|$|It was scholar D.T. Suzuki's {{contention}} that a spiritual awakening {{was always the}} goal of Chan's training, but <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> distinguished the tradition as it developed through the centuries in China {{was a way of}} life radically different from that of Indian Buddhists. In Indian Buddhism, the tradition of the mendicant prevailed, but Suzuki explained that in China social circumstances {{led to the development of}} a temple and training-center system in which the abbot and the monks all performed mundane tasks. These included food gardening or farming, carpentry, architecture, housekeeping, administration (or community direction), and the practice of Traditional Chinese medicine. Consequently, the enlightenment sought in Chan had to stand up well to the demands and potential frustrations of everyday life.|$|E

Shawn Levy, director of Date Night, stated <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> made him decide to cast Kunis with James Franco in the film was the chemistry he felt they had in the Funny or Die video.

She felt that shutting her relationship with Tommy was also a cleansing of who she was. She felt <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> she was dropping was the shmaltzy pop singer ballad kind of stuff he was adamant about. I had to make my exit and say 'Mariah, you need to redefine yourself, that's fine. I'm here doing what I do and if and when you want to come back and do it again, I'm here.|$|E

500|$|In 2009, she {{appeared}} in the comedy film Extract with Ben Affleck and Jason Bateman. The film received mostly positive reviews, and grossed $10.8 million at the box office. Roger Ebert, while critical of the film itself, wrote that Kunis [...] "brings her role to within shouting distance of credibility." [...] Director Mike Judge commented <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was surprising to learn about Kunis was her ability to make references to the cult animation film Rejected. Judge said: [...] "As beautiful as Mila is, you could believe that maybe she would cross paths {{with you in the}} real world." [...] After seeing Kunis perform in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Judge wanted to cast her in the role of Cindy in Extract: [...] "I just thought, 'Wow, this girl's perfect.' And she really wanted to do it, which was fantastic." [...] Kunis herself stated that [...] "I'm a huge fan of Mike Judge's from Office Space, so I was, like, 'Okay, this is a very easy decision.' I told them I would do anything needed to be in this production– like craft service, or, say, acting." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 5th Avenue Theatre's 2012 production, {{directed}} by Peter Rothstein, included African-American dancers and an African-American actor as Jud. The choice was intended, {{as in the}} Arena Stage production, to reflect the historical presence of African Americans in the Oklahoma territory, but it [...] "has some audience members squirming in their seats ... they're seeing on stage one of the ugliest stereotypes in our history: an imposing black man ravaging a petite white woman [...] the white hero ... all but urges Jud to hang himself – and even pantomimes the act. Some see a clear reference to lynching." [...] The [...] "Dream Ballet" [...] had a sinister, sexual tone and ended with Jud dragging Laurey away to be raped. One critic noted the historical [...] "license taken when an African-American farmhand is allowed to escort a white woman to the box dance. ... Maybe some people ... left with {{not so much a}} song in their head, but a question in their heart. And isn't <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> theater is supposed to do?"

2500|$|Varietys Maureen Ryan, who {{expected}} Lexa {{to eventually}} die, and called Clarke and Lexa's love and deathbed scenes spectacular, said the season had been rushed and Lexa's death after sex with Clarke [...] "was {{another case of}} the show compressing a timeline to an unfortunate degree." [...] Ryan argued that the way a character dies matters, particularly for LGBTQ characters, given their under-representation and misrepresentation in the media. She listed scenarios with pros and cons about how the show might have better played out the Lexa factor, including the suggestion of Lexa never being in season 3. While Bethonie Butler of The Washington Post stated <b>that</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> fueled the outrage is that The 100 {{was thought to be}} [...] "progressive in its treatment of LGBT characters," [...] and so the death led to feelings of betrayal, Hypable.com's Selina Wilken said that [...] "Season 3 did a lot to build Lexa up before her fall, turning her into an almost King Arthur-like figure of salvation in this broken world, at least partly in an effort to blind-sight and devastate the audience when she died. (And... mission accomplished, all too well.)" [...] Butler added, [...] "The controversy reveals the pitfalls of a show misunderstanding its audience and the politics of minority representation onscreen." ...|$|E
