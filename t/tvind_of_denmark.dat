50|$|The Danish media {{began to}} suspect <b>Tvind</b> <b>of</b> fraud by the late 1970s. Petersen, {{claiming}} to be a target for the SIS and the CIA, disappeared in 1979, {{not to be seen}} again for the next 22 years. He is alleged to have continued to covertly run his organisation from various locations, subverting Tvind's original humanitarian mission to create a lucrative financial web by diverting charitable funds into private coffers. Petersen's network soon became a business empire based on property and used clothes collection. Tvind has since then grown into a global conglomerate with numerous profit-motivated enterprises reportedly worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Its interests range from farming and timber to property, retail clothing and furniture, with businesses in Europe, the United States, Brazil, Belize, Ecuador, Malaysia and China.|$|R
