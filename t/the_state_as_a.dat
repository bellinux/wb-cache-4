40|$|This paper uses <b>the</b> welfare <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{vehicle for}} {{contrasting}} alternative theoretical orientations toward political economy: one orientation conceptualizes <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> organization; <b>the</b> other, which is embraced here, conceptualizes <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> order {{that in turn}} contains numerous organizations. The programs associated with <b>the</b> welfare <b>state</b> are thus emergent outcomes of polycentric processes and not the product of some actor’s maximizing choice. Among other things, this alternative conceptualization provides a different orientation toward state-sponsored redistribution...|$|R

5|$|August 1968: Two storms {{approached}} Arizona in 1968. The {{first was}} Tropical Storm Hyacinth in August. It reached the southeastern corner of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tropical depression, and produced showers and thunderstorms over the eastern {{portion of the}} state.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{around the}} mid-20th century, Texas began to {{transform}} from a rural and agricultural state {{to one that}} was urban and industrialized. The state's population grew quickly during this period, with large levels of migration from outside <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> part of the Sun Belt Texas experienced strong economic growth, particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s. Texas's economy diversified, lessening its reliance on the petroleum industry. By 1990, Hispanics overtook blacks to become the largest minority group in the state.|$|E
5|$|June 13, 2001– The {{remnants}} of Tropical Storm Allison enter <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> subtropical depression and drop over 10inches (250mm) of rainfall {{in the northeastern}} portion of the state; the rainfall results in nine indirect deaths due to traffic accidents on slick roads.|$|E

5|$|October 24, 2005– Hurricane Wilma makes {{landfall}} near Cape Romano {{as a major}} hurricane, producing hurricane-force {{winds and}} moderate precipitation across much of southern portion of the state. The winds of the hurricane leave 98% of South Florida without power. The passage of Wilma results in hundreds of damaged or destroyed homes, with damage reaching $20.6billion (2005USD, $25.8billion 2017USD), the fourth costliest tropical cyclone in United States history. Five people die in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|September 15, 1999- Once {{predicted}} {{to make a}} landfall on <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> major hurricane, Hurricane Floyd parallels the eastern coastline about 115miles (185km) offshore. At least 330homes are damaged by fallen trees, and rough surf results in heavy beach erosion. Monetary damage totals $61million (1999USD, $79million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{passage of}} Hurricane Isabel in Pennsylvania {{resulted}} in $160million in damage (2003USD, $ USD) and 2indirect deaths in Pennsylvania. One person suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning, {{believed to be}} caused due to improperly ventilated generators in an area affected by the power outages. Moderate winds left about 1.4million customers without power across <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of trees falling into power lines, with dozens of houses and cars damaged by the trees.|$|E
50|$|The {{church has}} been {{protected}} by <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> important historical monument since 1892. In 1985, the Slovak National Council (parliament) proclaimed it a National Historical Monument. An expensive reconstruction followed in the 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|Also in Genoa-Pontedecimo, {{from the}} 24-25 February, 1951, he {{helped found the}} [...] "Anarchist Groups of Proletarian Action" [...] (GAAP). There, he {{presented}} the thesis of [...] "Liquidation of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> apparatus of class." [...] In his thesis he argues that, [...] "the social revolution, that installs a classless society, is accomplished with the simultaneous liquidation of the bourgeoisie <b>as</b> <b>a</b> class and the liquidation of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> apparatus of class," [...] and that, [...] "it's {{the task of the}} proletarian mass organizations (factory councils, agricultural community, people's committees) expropriate the capitalist system of its facilities and to take on the direct and collective management." ...|$|R

5|$|Tracking through <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{weakening}} tropical storm, Humberto produced {{light to}} moderate winds across southwestern Louisiana. Gusts officially peaked at 43mph (69km/h) in the state, although an unofficial reading of 55mph (89km/h) {{was reported in}} Vinton. Heavy rainfall occurred across the area, reaching a peak of 8.25inches (210mm) in DeRidder. The rainfall triggered minor river flooding along the Vermilion River in Lafayette. Storm surge was minor in the state, peaking at 2.13feet (0.65m) in Cypremont Point; no beach erosion was reported.|$|E
5|$|Arizona {{has been}} {{affected}} by hurricanes on numerous occasions. Usually, these storms originate in the eastern Pacific Ocean, make landfall in the Mexican states of Baja California or Sonora, and dissipate before crossing into the United States. Thus, in most cases, {{it is only the}} tropical cyclones' remnant moisture that produces heavy rainfall—and in some occasions, flooding—in portions of Arizona. However, approximately every five years, a tropical cyclone retains sufficient strength to enter <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tropical storm or a tropical depression. Arizonans can expect indirect flash floods caused by the remnants of tropical cyclones to occur about every two years.|$|E
5|$|As the Ottoman Empire {{proposed}} international mediation, Cuza {{took the}} initiative, and, on October 23, 1863, deposed the Kretzulescu cabinet, nominating instead his own selection of men: Kogălniceanu as Premier and Interior Minister, Dimitrie Bolintineanu as Minister of Religious Affairs. In {{order to prevent}} further international tensions, they decided to generalize confiscation to all Eastern Orthodox Church estates, Greek {{as well as those}} of the incipient Romanian Orthodox monasteries. The resolution was passed with 97 out of 100 parliamentary votes. Later, the Greek Church was presented with an offer of 150 million piasters as compensation, which was viewed as two low by its intended recipients, including Patriarch Sophoronius III. Consequently, the Romanian state considered the matter closed. As a direct consequence, one third of the arable land in Moldavia and a fourth of that in Wallachia were made available for a future land reform (one fifth to one fourth of the total arable land in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole).|$|E
5000|$|The {{collective}} society. Europeanism {{emphasizes the}} view that societal divisions will occur in spite of attempts to ensure equal opportunity, and accepts the role of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> economic manager and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> guarantor of societal welfare.|$|R
5000|$|Even at its {{beginning}} it included innovative courses such as domestic hygiene and urban public health. It was officially recognized as providing [...] "public utility" [...] in 1870, and recognized by <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> {{institution of higher}} education in 1934.|$|R
50|$|This {{caused some}} leaders to {{consider}} the administrative base of the federation <b>as</b> <b>a</b> notion to underestimate the authority of <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> and led <b>the</b> national government to view the independent aspirations of <b>the</b> <b>states</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> threat to <b>the</b> overall nation.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{moving across}} <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> minimal hurricane, {{there were no}} reports of hurricane-force winds on {{mainland}} Florida. The highest official recorded wind report was 60mph (97km/h) in Miami Beach, while the highest accurate wind gust was 71mph (114km/h) in Vero Beach. In addition to the National Weather Service Reports, the South Florida Water Management District reported higher wind gusts near Lake Okeechobee of up to 93mph (150km/h) in Belle Glade, though these were likely caused by small-scale meso-cyclone-induced downbursts. Irene produced heavy rainfall across southeastern Florida, peaking at 17.45inches (443mm) at Boynton Beach, though many areas in the Miami Metropolitan Area received from 10 to 15inches (255 to 380mm). One F1 and three F0 tornadoes touched down in Broward and Palm Beach Counties, injuring three people.|$|E
5|$|In Parliament, a {{political}} crisis {{developed over the}} king's policy of seeking a Spanish wife for Charles, Prince of Wales, {{as part of a}} proposed alliance with the Habsburgs. In the parliament of 1621, it fell to Calvert to advocate the Spanish Match, as it came to be called, against the majority of Parliament, who feared an increase in Catholic influence on <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result of his pro-Spanish stance and defence of relaxations in the penal laws against Catholics, Calvert became estranged from many in the Commons, who were suspicious of his close familiarity with the Spanish ambassador's court. Calvert also faced difficulties in his private life: his wife's death on 8 August 1622 left him the single father of ten children, the oldest of whom, Cecil, was sixteen years old.|$|E
5|$|In Veracruz, 124people {{were killed}} in the event, {{including}} three in a rescue helicopter crash. About 23,500people statewide had to evacuate to emergency shelters in 452communities. The governor declared <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> disaster zone after 13rivers exceeded their banks, and two entire villages were washed away. A total of 75,135people were injured in Veracruz, about one third of whom became homeless due to the floods. In rural areas, 77,123people lost power. Statewide, 11bridges were damaged, and 22portions along the Poza Rica-Veracruz highway was damaged. In Zaragoza, the floods destroyed 91% of the year's crops.|$|E
