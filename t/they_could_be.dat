50|$|Class 65 {{locomotives}} {{proved to}} be exceptionally reliable engines, but <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> used universally, because their coal bunkers and water tanks were small. As a result, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> only <b>be</b> used for short-range goods traffic.|$|R

50|$|Another {{benefit of}} the RCS-based designs was that the RCS {{thrusters}} <b>could</b> <b>be</b> fired in bursts as short as ten milliseconds, so instead of complex throttling hardware <b>they</b> <b>could</b> simply <b>be</b> pulsed to adjust the average thrust over time. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> also <b>be</b> used to provide attitude control by varying the firing rate of different thrusters {{around the edge of}} the LESS.|$|R
5|$|Amrullah Saleh {{has been}} {{speaking}} and writing extensively {{on these issues}} in both local and international media. He maintains that the Taliban need to disarm and honor {{the integrity of the}} Afghan constitution before <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> considered for any reconciliation process.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn {{was also}} a zealous {{advocate}} for improved river navigation. He persuaded the legislature to apply a $100,000 allocation from the U.S. Congress to the improvement of navigation along the Kentucky River and gave concurrent jurisdiction over the Big Sandy and Licking Rivers {{to the federal government}} so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> improved as well. Legislators also approved construction of a canal around the Cumberland Falls and improvements along the Tradewater River.|$|E
5|$|By February 1916, all of {{the lower}} casemates for her six-inch guns had been plated over and six {{of them had been}} remounted on the upper deck so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used in heavy weather. Several twelve-pounders had to be removed {{to make room for the}} six-inch guns.|$|E

5|$|Emeco founder Wilton C. Dinges {{developed}} the Emeco 1006 chair in 1944 {{in collaboration with}} the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA). It was originally designed for the US Navy, which needed a chair for the deck of battleships that could survive sea air and a torpedo blast {{to the side of the}} ship. The chairs had eye bolts under the seat, so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> attached to a ship-deck using cables.|$|E
5|$|Fairley was {{acutely aware}} that much {{remained}} unknown about malaria. In particular, {{he was interested in}} the possibility that sulphaguanidine (or a related sulphonamide) might be a causal prophylactic against malaria, as <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> manufactured in Australia, unlike atebrin and plasmoquine. Fairley decided to establish a unit in Cairns to investigate malaria. The LHQ Medical Research Unit commenced work in June 1943.|$|E

5|$|In 1853, Charles Moreign {{purchased}} {{several small}} houses {{at the end}} of Vine Street so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> redeveloped into St James's Hall, Piccadilly. A rear entrance to the hall backed onto the street. The hall was demolished in 1905 and replaced by the Piccadilly Hotel, which also backs onto Vine Street.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the bill}} granted the Governor of Alaska {{authority}} {{to enter into}} reciprocal mental health treatment agreements with the governors of other states. Alaskans who became mentally ill in the lower 48 states would be properly treated locally until <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> returned to Alaska; likewise, citizens of the lower 48 who fell mentally ill in Alaska would receive care there, before being returned to their home states.|$|E

During the American Civil War, most senior officers received a brevet promotion, particularly during the final months of the war.|$|E

5|$|McCormick {{increasingly}} {{resented the}} favours FitzRoy gave to assist Darwin with collecting. On 16 February, FitzRoy landed a small party including himself and Darwin on St. Paul's rocks, finding the seabirds so tame that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> killed easily, while an exasperated McCormick was left circling the islets {{in a second}} small boat. That evening novices were greeted by a pseudo-Neptune, {{and in the morning}} they crossed the equator with the traditional line-crossing ceremony.|$|E
5|$|New Labour {{accepted}} the economic efficiency of {{free markets and}} believed that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> detached from capitalism to achieve the aims of socialism, while maintaining the efficiency of capitalism. Markets were also useful for giving power to consumers and allowing citizens {{to make their own}} decisions and act responsibly. New Labour embraced market economics because they believed <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used for their social aims, as well as economic efficiency. The party did not believe that public ownership was efficient or desirable; ensuring that they were not seen to be ideologically pursuing centralised public ownership was important to the party. In government, the party relied on public-private partnerships and private finance initiatives to raise funds and mitigate fears of a 'tax and spend' policy or excessive borrowing.|$|E
5|$|On 2 January 1967, the United States Air Force {{launched}} Operation Bolo {{with the}} aim of luring North Vietnamese MiG fighters into an air battle, where <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> destroyed in an ambush.

5|$|PortLINK is {{the most}} complex of the proposals, as it {{involves}} making decisions {{on the future of}} the Outer Harbor and Grange railway lines. The report proposes several different options for these lines. <b>They</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> electrified but remain as heavy rail, or <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> converted to light rail - with potential spurlines added to West Lakes and Semaphore. Light rail options for the Grange railway line include converting the entire line to light rail, diverting it to West Lakes and closing the section beyond Albert Park station, or replacing it with new on-street routes to Grange and West Lakes. The PortLINK routes are very similar to a group of light rail extensions to West Lakes, Port Adelaide and Semaphore that were announced in the 2008 South Australian Budget but then scrapped in the 2012 budget.|$|E
5|$|Roads {{offered the}} enemy fast routes to their {{objectives}} and consequently they were blocked at strategic points. Many of the road-blocks formed by Ironside were semi-permanent. In many cases, Brooke had these removed altogether, as experience had shown <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{as much of}} an impediment to friends as to foes. Brooke favoured removable blocks.|$|E
5|$|The Schwere Heeres Panzer Abteilung 501 (s.H.Pz.Abt. 501) {{arrived on}} the Eastern Front with only eight out of 45 tanks operational; these faults were mostly due to {{drive-train}} failures.
