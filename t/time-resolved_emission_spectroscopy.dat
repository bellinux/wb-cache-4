Ru(II) polyazine light absorbers are efficient light harvesters absorbing in the UV and visible with emissive 3 MLCT excited states known to undergo excited state energy and electron transfer. Changes in emission intensity, energy or band-shape, {{as well as}} excited state lifetime, provide insight into excited state dynamics. Photophysical processes such as intramolecular electron transfer between electron donor and electron acceptor sub-units may be investigated using these methods. This review investigates the use of steady-state and <b>time-resolved</b> <b>emission</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> to measure excited state intramolecular electron transfer in polyazine bridged Ru(II),Rh(III) supramolecular complexes. Intramolecular electron transfer in these systems provides for conversion of the emissive 3 MLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) excited state to a non-emissive, but potentially photoreactive, 3 MMCT (metal-to-metal charge transfer) excited state.
