Two hop wireless networks consist of source, relay and destination nodes. Big data has to transmit from source to relay and from relay to destination by deploying security in physical layer. Cooperative jamming scheme determines transmission of big data in more secure manner by protecting it from eavesdroppers and malicious nodes of unknown location. The novel algorithm that ensures secure and energy balance transmission of big data, includes selection of data transmitting region, segmenting the selected region, determining probability ratio for each node (capture node, non-capture and eavesdropper node) in every segment, evaluating the probability using binary based evaluation.

The aforementioned inter-relay handoff problem can be formulated as an SMDP [11], which is a generalization of an MDP by allowing a decision maker to choose actions whenever the system state changes and allowing the time spent in a particular state to follow an arbitrary probability distribution. A standard form of an SMDP model consists of the following five elements: (1) decision epochs; (2) states; (3) actions; (4) rewards; and (5) state transition probabilities.

40|$|Abstract—For {{multihop}} wireless networks, {{a fundamental}} {{question is whether}} it is advantageous to route over many short hops (short-hop routing) or over {{a smaller number of}} longer hops (long-hop routing). Short-hop routing has gained a lot of support, and its proponents mainly produce two arguments: higher SNR at every hop and smaller interference. This paper focuses on the first argument and examines different routing strategies from an informationtheoretic perspective, taking into account the rate penalty incurred by multihop transmission. We analytically derive the optimum number of hops for a linear network given the path loss exponent and the desired end-to-end rate for the case where the delay is not constrained. The analysis is based on the concept of asymptotic spectral efficiency. It turns out that routing over longer hops is competitive for higher rates; in particular, single-hop transmission outperforms <b>two-hop</b> <b>transmission</b> if the rate is larger than the path loss exponent. For delay-constrained transmission, we compare single-hop and <b>two-hop</b> <b>transmission</b> using a sphere-packing bound and simulations with practical codes, taking into account the reduced block length in the two-hop case.

Moreover, analysis shows that minimizing the network energy consumption at a given rate is not equivalent to maximizing the rate given energy, since it only covers part of all rates achievable by decode-forward. We thus combine the optimized schemes for network and relay energy consumptions into a generalized one, which then covers all achievable rates. This generalized scheme is not only energy-optimal for the desired source rate but also rate-optimal for the consumed energy. The results also give a detailed understanding of the power consumption regimes and allow a comprehensive description of the optimal message coding and resource allocation for each desired source rate and channel realization.

While the transmitters and the relays are equipped with multiple antennas, the receivers have a single antenna.

We assume that the two-hop links have a common timesharing value and perfect inter-user frame synchronization, i.e., the transmissions in each hop start {{at the same time and}} end at the same time. Although this assumption requires some coordination among the transmitters before the actual data transmission, it allows for tractable analysis to obtain insights into the system performance and provides a benchmark for the scenarios with relaxed assumptions on inter-user frame synchronization. We also assume that the parameters of the first hop are fixed and focus on the design of transmission parameters at the relays. This is reasonable when the relays are allowed to schedule users[10], as in IEEE 802.16 j[11], IEEE 802.16 m[12], and 3 GPP LTE/LTE-Advanced standards[13]. It is important to note that we consider end-to-end achievable rates.
