It is argued here that the symbiosis observed today among such groups as Southeast Asian Negritos, the !Kung Bushmen, and the African Pygmies is neither recent nor anomalous but reflects a subsistence strategy <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>followed</b> by most hunter-gatherers for millennia...|$|R

Their unusual {{transport}} properties, {{especially the}} low electric conductivity, are indications {{of the particular}} electronic structure of these materials. There are several approaches toward understanding the electronic structure of these systems. Whereas a complete understanding is still lacking, quasicrystals can heuristically be described as Hume-Rothery alloys, which qualitatively account for the experimentally observed properties.
