40|$|Value stream mapping {{has been}} used in several {{companies}} as a powerful tool to identify wastes and to help to design production system incorporating the lean concept. Its application to extended value streams is recent and it has shown the substantial wastes can be eliminated across different companies in the supply chain. This paper is a case of adoption of Lean manufacturing methodology to <b>Tyre</b> <b>Rim</b> Assembly at Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. Nagpur. The author discuss wastes that can be identified and possible proposals to reduce in the current state of <b>tyre</b> <b>rim</b> assembly line, also to enhance the performance through continuous improvement and cutting down SEVEN TYPES OF WASTS (muda,mura,muri in Japanese). Being originally a concept applied to production, “LEAN MANUFACTURING ” {{is the name of the}} production systems that produces“more with less”, also known as Lean production or No waste production or minimum COSTS production. The various problems are found in assembly line. The SEVEN WASTES for the assembly lines was an area of concern, which has been analyzed here, and considering other various problems a lean system has been developed for <b>tyre</b> and <b>rim</b> in assembly line. In waste reduction activities we focus on non-value adding activities, which add to cost and not value...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the coupling resonance conditions of the <b>tyre,</b> cavity and <b>rim</b> with the attachment of trim layers on the inner surface of tyre to mitigate the resonance effect. In order to validate the mathematical formulation, finite element analysis and experimental modal testing were performed to determine the frequency response function (FRF) for a tyre-wheel assembly with and without the trim layers {{as well as for}} separated <b>tyre</b> and <b>rim.</b> It was found that the resonance magnitude has been reduced when the trim layers were added. Couplings of cavity resonance to the <b>tyre</b> and <b>rim</b> were plausible due to the proximity of their resonance frequencies. Trim materials were tested using an impedance tube to suggest the best sound absorbing materials {{that can be used to}} mitigate the tyre cavity resonance effect...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} the effects of mechanised logging and log skidding on some components of farm tractors used under the Tractor Hiring Units (THU) of the Ministry of Agriculture in Ondo State, Nigeria. Thirty tractors of various makes and models were examined after a period under logging operations based on a template of eight key criteria and thirty four sub criteria related to vital tractor systems and components. Data collected were analysed to determine {{the percentage of the}} components that are good, damaged but repairable or damaged or missing parts. The results show that the highest occurrence of failure are with worn out tyres (80 %), followed by broken rear work lights, headlamps and road warning lights (60 %) and broken lateral stabilizers (53. 3 %). Similarly, the least damaged components of tractors under the study were the <b>tyre</b> <b>rims</b> (66. 7 % good), wheel hubs and axle arms (56. 7 %) and hydraulic linkage arms and forks as well as brake pedal travel and release (46. 7 %) ...|$|R

40|$|Electric {{vehicles}} (EV's) are {{alternative fuel}} technology in auto industry with wide acceptance across globe. This paper elaborates virtual {{methods used to}} as tool for safety and ergonomic evaluations of in wheel design using Switch Reluctance Motor (SRM). In our recent research, a unique design of in wheel design using SRM has been developed. Special advantages of this design include modularity, scalability, cost effectiveness, and easy installation. Easy installation of in wheel design architecture {{is one of the}} prime criteria, since it relates to changing of tyres in long runs. In the proposed passenger car, if work is carried out for maintenance issues, generally single operator (mechanic) dose tyre changing or wheel/brake servicing. Two validations are important, mainly safety of the operator; secondly design for assembly of motor, and <b>tyre</b> <b>rims.</b> As a part of this research, Virtual Reality (VR) based safety and ergonomic evaluation studies have been conducted for the in wheel design adaptations. The computational models and virtual modelling simulations using motion capture, Arena and EON reality mimicked live system environments, so as to validate effectiveness motor assembly and disassembly functionality using human as an interface. Initial phase consists of schematic representations of models to evaluate conceptualisation for different designs. Based on schematics, SR motor and <b>rim</b> <b>tyre</b> models were developed and interfaced in VR environment. In second phase, vehicle topology was reverse engineered using hand held 3 D scanner and converted to metafile for full scale model development. In third phase, motion capture was used with 20 camera systems to video record the existing human movements and rigid body such as tyre to develop live environment. Finally all three phases were interfaced together in VR environment to evaluate assembly and disassembly functions. Based on the validation of these, designs were fine tuned for effective assembly functionality. The VR based safety and ergonomic evaluation procedures were used for demonstration of wheel assembly disassembly functions by single operator. Similar context can be extended to other automotive design evaluations, without substantial prototype costs for safety and ergonomic evaluations...|$|R
40|$|Even {{though there}} are no {{regulations}} on the interior noise level of passenger cars, it is a significant quality aspect both for customers and for car manufacturers. The reduction of many other car noise sources pushed tyre road noise to the forefront. What is more, well known phenomenon of the tyre acoustic cavity resonance (TCR), appearing around 225 Hz, makes the interior noise noticeably worse. Some techniques to mitigate this phenomenon right at the source are discussed in this thesis, however, these has not been adopted by the tyre nor car manufacturers yet. Therefore, there is a desire to minimise at least the transmission of the acoustic or vibration energy from the tyre to the compartment. This is where methods like TPA (Transfer Path Analysis) come into play. In this thesis, two different approaches to TPA are used to investigate transmission of the TCR energy. First, the coherence based road decomposition method is used {{to determine whether the}} TCR energy is transmitted by a structure-borne or an air-borne mechanism. The same method serves to identify if the TCR noise comes mainly from the front or the rear suspension. Second, the impedance matrix method was used to determine critical structure-borne transfer paths yielding clear results indicating two critical mounts at the rear suspension which dominate the transfer of vibro-acoustic energy. Subsequent physical modification of the critical mount was tested to verify the results of the transmission study. Moreover, deflection shape analysis of the <b>tyre,</b> <b>rim,</b> front and rear suspension was performed to identify possible amplification effects of the TCR phenomenon...|$|R

5000|$|The {{resulting}} combination {{was either}} slightly lighter or stronger than more common clincher tyres [...] until the clincher <b>tyres</b> and <b>rims</b> technology {{caught up in}} recent years. Taken as a whole the total weight of a tubular <b>rim</b> and <b>tyre</b> is always lighter than its clincher equivalent. However, for all non-racing purposes the lightness advantage is somewhat offset {{by the need to}} carry at least one entire spare tubular tyre (only a patch kit or inner tube are needed if using clincher tyres). Yet the extra weight—and more importantly, rotational inertia—is off the wheel, which therefore accelerates more easily. Advances in tire sealant have made carrying an extra tire a bit outdated.|$|R
50|$|One way to {{estimate}} wheel diameter {{is to add}} twice the nominal tyre cross-section to the rim diameter. For example, consider a 700c &times; 23 mm tire, which has a nominal cross-section of 23 mm. 700c wheels have a rim diameter of 622 mm. Hence the wheel diameter is (2 &times; 23 mm) + 622 mm = 668 mm which is equal to 26.3 inches (rounded to 1 decimal place). 26 inch mountain bicycle wheels have a rim diameter of 559 mm. This ignores {{factors that contribute to}} the actual rolling radius of the <b>tyre</b> and <b>rim</b> together: the vertical deflection of the tire above the contact patch and the difference between the manufacturer's stated size and the actual tire radius when mounted and inflated.|$|R

2500|$|The Moke {{was built}} in Australia from 1966 to 1981 where it was {{originally}} marketed as the Morris Mini Moke and from 1973 as the Leyland Moke. Initially Australian Mokes had the same 10-inch wheels as British Mokes and Mini saloons but in 1968 these were replaced by 13-inch wheels with longer rear trailing arms, which made them more practical for gentle off-road or beach use than the British version. There was also a widening piece welded to the wheel arches, front and rear to allow for wider <b>tyres</b> and <b>rims.</b> [...] The solid metal seats of the British Mokes were replaced with tubular-framed [...] "deck-chair" [...] seats. This variant started with a 998cc engine, which was switched mid-production to 1,098cc. In 1976, {{with the advent of}} new anti-pollution requirements (Australian Design Rule 27A), the locally manufactured 1,098cc motor was replaced by an imported version of the 998cc motor with an air pump and exhaust gas recirculation, which had been developed to meet UK (US?) anti-pollution requirements.|$|R

The first thing she was called on to contemplate was the turning of the <b>tyre</b> or <b>rim</b> {{of one of the}} driving-wheels of a locomotive. Often had Mrs Marrot heard her husband talk of tyres and driving-wheels, and many a time had she seen these wheels whirling, half-concealed, in their appropriate places, but never till that day had she seen the iron hoop, eight feet in diameter, elevated in bare simplicity on a turning-lathe, where its size impressed her so much that she declared, [...] "she never could 'ave imagined engine-wheels was so big," [...] and asked, [...] "'ow did they ever manage to get 'em lifted up to w'ere they was?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Often, owners may {{desire to}} lower their vehicle {{to such an extent}} that they must cut away {{portions}} of the frame for more clearance. A reinforcement member commonly referred to as a C-notch is then bolted or welded to the vehicle frame in order to maintain structural integrity. Specifically on pickup trucks, this process is termed [...] "notching" [...] because a portion (notch) of the cargo bed may also be removed, along with the wheel wells, to provide maximum axle clearance. For some, it is desirable to have the vehicle so low that the frame rests on the ground when the air bags are fully deflated. Owners generally choose between having their cars 'tuck' their wheels into the arches when their air suspension is fully lowered or alternatively they can choose to go for 'fitment' which in partnership with stretched tyres sees the arch itself fit in between the <b>tyre</b> and <b>rim.</b>|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the change}} of axles, the 4x4 LTs came with {{completely}} different wheel rims to standard LTs. All 4x4 LTs have 6 stud tube type split-rims in 6.5J width. The standard tyre fitment on these rims is 7.00x16 or 7.50x16. The biggest <b>tyre</b> that these <b>rims</b> will take is 9.00x16 (or 255/100/16), which will give another 6 cm of ground clearance, but that will require arch modifications in the front. Mefro has a 16x8J ET0 rim in their portfolio, that will fit the 4x4 LT, but these can't be bought directly. Owners have managed {{to get hold of}} these rims over a group buy. The Mefro rims will then allow to run 285/75/16 tyres on the 4x4 LT.|$|R
5000|$|Available to order, a {{standard}} Black Lightning was supplied in racing trim with magnesium alloy components, special racing <b>tyres</b> on alloy <b>rims,</b> rear-set foot controls, a solo seat and aluminium mudguards. This reduced the Lightning's weight to 380 lb. The [...] air-cooled OHV pushrod V-twin specifications were always based on standard parts but upgraded with higher-performance racing equipment. The Black Lightning had higher-strength connecting rods, larger inlet ports, polished rocker gear, steel idler gears, racing carburettors, and a manual-advance magneto, and was available with compression ratios between 6.8:1 and 12.5:1. This resulted in [...] {{and a top}} speed of 150 mph. Only 31 Black Lightnings were ever built before production ended in 1952 because of Vincent's financial problems.|$|R
