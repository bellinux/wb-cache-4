40|$|To {{define the}} {{preliminary}} embryogenesis culture conditions of Moroccan Cork Oak (Quercus suber L.) in secondary propagation systems, secondary embryos formation from primary embryos {{were analyzed using}} seven macronutrient medias: (Chalupa) (BTM), Murashige and Skoog (MS), Schenk and Hildebrant (SH), Schenk and Hildebrant with half content macronutrients (SH), full Gam-borg (G), Margara (N 30 K) and Woody Plant Media(WPM). Mature primary embryos at cotyledonal stage of 8 - 10 mm, were placed in each culture medium, and supplemented with 30 g/l of glucose and 7 g/l of agar without PGR. The experimental design consisted of a Petri dish containing three embryos explants. Each {{one of the seven}} treatments was composed of ten Petri dishes. Mean number of secondary somatic embryos, clusters and new embryogenic formation on clusters were recorded after 8 weeks, and evaluated by statistical analysis. There were no significant differences (p ≤ 0. 05) in clusters and new embryos on clusters formation among evaluated media; but mean number of secondary embryos was significantly higher in N 30 K (4. 37 ± 0. 48) compared with con-trol media (1. 37 ± 0. 15). The morphology of secondary embryos grown in the N 30 K medium exclu-sively showed the presence of three embryogenic stages: early cotyledonal with <b>translucide</b> as...|$|E
