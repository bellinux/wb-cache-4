40|$|Sewability is very {{significant}} for industrial sewing machines and has received much attention and improvement. In this research, four on-line monitoring sensors are developed for industrial sewing machines {{in order to}} measure sewing parameters and help to detect sewability problems. Specifically, the developed sensors are thread length measurement sensor, <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> sensor, <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> setting sensor, and needle force sensor. These sensors can provide detailed information on thread consumption, instantaneous <b>thread</b> <b>tension,</b> <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> setup, and needle penetration force. The thread length measurement sensor can measure the top thread length that goes into a given sew: According to the experimental results, it is found that this sensor can be used to set up the <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> properly. Therefore, it can help to minimize the sewability problems. The <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> sensor can measure the instantaneous <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> during sewing stitches. Hence, it can detect an improper <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> setup and help to minimize the sewability problems. However, its high cost limits its application. The <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> setting sensor is then developed in order for sewing operators to set up the <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> properly and quickly. It is also a cost-effective sensor that can provide data leading to solutions to the sewability problems. The needle force sensor can measure the instantaneous needle force during needle penetration and withdrawal. The new design of the sensor ensures that the measurements are more accurate than other measurement methods. This sensor can be used to help detect sewability problems resulting from an improper needle penetration force. In summary, the developed sensors can not only be used to measure the sewing parameters and help to detect the sewability problems, but they can also provide a data acquisition method for the automatic control of industrial sewing machines. With these sensors instrumented on industrial sewing machines, the sewability problems will be minimized. Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering.

30|$|In {{previous}} studies by Rengasamy and Samuel (2011) on needle <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> for lock-stitch 301, four tension peaks have been signified {{by measuring the}} online tension of stitch formation.

30|$|Prediction of {{sewing thread}} {{consumption}} requires an accurate {{method of calculation}} since {{it relates to the}} cost of manufacturing and distribution of apparel products. Previous researchers highlighted problems in existing thread consumption calculation methods; i.e. limitations in existing formulae which cause inaccurate predictions of thread amount needed for sewing operations. The existing methods of consumption calculations exhibit significant error percentages due to the ignorance of important parameters which affect on thread consumption. This paper investigates on correlation of <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> to thread consumption of lock-stitch 301 and chain-stitch 401. The existing thread consumption formulae are optimized by considering a new parameter; <b>thread</b> <b>tension,</b> using regression analysis and geometrical modeling techniques. For the chain-stitch 401, results indicate that the <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> significantly affects in determination of the thread consumption. The error analysis of proposed formulae was performed to indicate that the proposed formulae more accurate compared to the available methods of predicting sewing thread consumption. In addition, there are combined effects of thread tensions together with parameters such as fabric thickness and stitch density which determines accurate consumption values considering the properties of the stitch. In comparison, inclusion of the proposed <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> variable depicts reduction in error percentages, so that the proposed formulae are expected to be a better approach to calculate thread consumption of lock-stitch 301 and chain-stitch 401.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} new parameter; <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> being experimented using standard procedures for two main types of stitches namely lock-stitch 301 and chain-stitch 401. For both stitches, <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> affects significantly in determination of thread consumption. In case of chain-stitch 401, there are combined effects of thread tensions together with fabric thickness and stitch density which determines accurate consumption values considering {{the properties of}} the stitch. The analysis of lock-stitch 301 shows a joint effect of <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> and yarn count to the consumption of the needle thread. In comparison, inclusion of proposed <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> variable depicts reduction in error percentages, so that the proposed formulae are expected to be a better approach to calculate thread consumption of lock-stitch 301 and chain-stitch 401. Once tension parameter is included in the formulae, apparel manufacturers need to optimize and measure the tension during garment pre-production stage as specified for the geometric requirement of the stitch. The average tension value set for a given stitch under selected stitch density can be measured using MLT Wesco tension meter and that figure need to be substituted in calculating the thread consumption. If researchers are able to introduce a standard table which represents average tension values which determine the correct geometry of the stitches under different stitch density levels, industry personnel or software system can easily refer such table and substitute the tension values to the proposing formulae.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to review theoretical and practical approaches of sewing thread consumption prediction methods based on the literature and to propose new method incorporating <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> parameter. Thread consumption formulae were derived by investigating the effect of <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> for two basic types of stitches namely lock-stitch 301 and chain-stitch 401. Accuracy of those optimized formulae was measured through an error analysis by comparing theoretical and actual thread consumption values. The error percentage values of the newly developed formulae were compared with the other methodologies developed by other researchers and sewing thread manufacturers for calculating sewing thread consumption.|$|E

40|$|The weaving {{process is}} {{substantially}} {{influenced by the}} warp <b>thread</b> <b>tension.</b> In order to obtain good fabric quality at a smooth run of the loom, the optimisation of the warp <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> is necessary. The tension is influenced by a multitude of parameters, especially the back shedding geometry. The pure analytical determination of the best back shedding geometry is not possible. The experimental determination of the best loom setting takes up {{a great deal of}} time and is only an approximation. This complex task occurs particularly with new products, for which the user has not established machine settings yet. Within the framework of the presented thesis the development of a technical system is presented that provides optimised machine settings based on machine and fabric specific data and with help of mathematic methods and simulations. Neural networks have been trained and tested for the prediction of ideal article and machine specific warp <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> sequences (comparison tension sequences) based on empiric data of weaving mills. For that the necessary product, machine and operational data was collected on very well adjusted weaving machines with satisfactory processing performance and fabric quality over a long time period. This data has been analysed by special mathematic methods. The determination of the machine setting from the tension sequence is not possible directly. Because of that the optimisation algorithm of the AUTO-WARP-concept, that has been developed at the Institut für Textiltechnik der RWTH Aachen (ITA), is used. According to the principle of evolution strategy and based on fabric and machine data, the comparison tension sequence and by the help of a special simulation program of the ITA for warp <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> sequences the fabric and machine specific optimised machine setting is calculated. For an easy operation the various described components have been put together to one program and a common user interface was created to achieve a simple data input according to the demand of a weaving mill. The developed system was tested in practise for the product family of aramid yarns. In the practise test the developed adjustment device was able to determine good and very good machine settings for new products and machines, although the test fabric was far out of the training product spectrum. With the recommended loom setting the warp <b>thread</b> <b>tension</b> sequence, the run of the loom and the fabric quality were improved clearly. The adjustment device is a tool for the weaver that makes a good and quick fabric specific adjustment of the back shedding possible even for new fabrics. By this it enable the weaver to reduce material, machine and personal costs and to improve the fabric quality. The program is simple to operate and runs on usual personal computers. In order to use the system for new product families the neural networks have to be trained with corresponding data. This further conversion and marketing strategies are viewed finally...|$|E

Sewing machine speed increases lead to a loss of control of the sewing process due largely to an increase of the dynamic forces and consequently to problems such as seam pucker. In this research computer-based instrumentation and high-speed digital image and signal acquisition systems were developed to study the dynamic effects of the sewing machine, fabric and thread on seam pucker. Needle <b>thread</b> <b>tension,</b> needle bar pressure/tension, presser-foot pressure and displacement signals were acquired simultaneously by 4 strain-gage/piezo-quartz sensors mounted on a Pfaff- 563 machine and results were related to pucker measured by a CCO colour-video camera system integrated with the sewing machine. A series of experiments conducted on various types of fabrics provided illustrative examples of the characteristics of each signal acquired (distinctive shape, amplitudes-peaks valleys locations, duration etc), and also enabled their characteristics to be compared and the interactions among the signals to be studied.

Despite {{the variety of}} their design, industrial materials analysis shows that breakages occur in rod body and threaded connections. In the process of lowering and lifting operations, aimed at well pump replacement, screwing and unscrewing of sucker rods threaded joints is repeated, so pin threads and couplings are worn. After analyzing the method of pin threads wear determining while screwing, unscrewing, connection and breakout sucker rods tightening, proposed by S. A. Babayan, {{it has been found}} out that the amount of thread wear during the makeup is 20 30 times greater than thread wear while fastening. According to this method the last three threads are practically unworn and deterioration of the first coil is 10 - 12 times greater than the wear of the last turns. The results of calculation correspond with the wear data in the course of sucker rods operation in an industrial environment. To identify and compare the distribution of stresses in the sucker rods threaded connections using the developed computer ANSYS, finite element axisymmetric models of new and worn standard threaded connections with a diameter of 19 mm have been created. Screw connections were loaded by axial force and torque make-up. Having analyzed the simulation results we have made a conclusion that with the increase of sucker rod wear, stress distribution in pin thread becomes uniform, respectively, it has positive effect on the threaded connection durability under cyclic dynamic loads. With further deterioration, <b>thread</b> <b>tensions</b> are rising in the middle turns, and in extreme turns - are reduced, so the impact of further deterioration on the connection durability is negative.
