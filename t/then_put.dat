5|$|In {{a change}} to {{previous}} seasons, CTV broadcast episodes {{one and two}} over two weeks, {{as opposed to an}} hour-long special. In the US, The N did broadcast the episodes as an hour-long special, on 7 October 2005. The N proceeded to broadcast the next ten episodes, and <b>then</b> <b>put</b> the season on hiatus until 7 April 2006, when it returned with another hour-long special.|$|E
5|$|Kemper <b>then</b> <b>put</b> {{both of the}} women's {{bodies in}} the trunk of his Ford Galaxie and {{returned}} to his apartment, being stopped on the way by a police officer for a broken taillight but managing not to be detected for his more serious offences. His roommate was not at home, so he took the bodies into his apartment, where he took pornographic photographs of, and had sex with, the naked corpses before dismembering them. He <b>then</b> <b>put</b> the body parts into plastic bags, which he later abandoned near Loma Prieta Mountain. Before disposing of Pesce's and Luchessa's severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio with both of them. In August, Pesce's skull was found up on Loma Prieta Mountain. An extensive search failed to turn up the rest of her remains or a trace of her companion.|$|E
5|$|Portland {{has had two}} {{replicas of}} Philadelphia's {{original}} Liberty Bell. The first replica was purchased in 1962 for $8,000. It arrived in Portland in June 1963, with a damaged base and beam since the sculpture had slipped off its supports. Repairs were made before the replica was paraded through the city on a flatbed truck, <b>then</b> <b>put</b> into storage until Independence Day. The bell was publicly rung {{for the first time}} during holiday celebrations and installed in City Hall's rotunda on May 5, 1964.|$|E

The body was <b>then</b> <b>put</b> in an old clock case and stored in the house of Beswick's family physician, Dr Charles White. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a local celebrity, and visitors were allowed to view her at White's house.|$|E
5|$|CNN {{reported}} {{that at least}} two men and altogether five persons set themselves on fire after pouring gasoline over themselves. They did not see a child among the self-immolators. The CNN crew began filming the events from a distance, but were quickly intercepted by military police, who detained the journalists and confiscated their equipment. The authorities <b>then</b> <b>put</b> out the flames consuming the other four people's clothing. A police van came to collect the badly burnt man, and two ambulances arrived almost 25 minutes later to collect the other four. The square was completely closed, and security was tight the next day, the most important of the traditional Chinese holidays. Police monitored public access to the square for the New Year celebrations, had fire extinguishers ready, and prevented Falun Gong practitioners from opening banners.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{has said}} that the main {{inspiration}} for The Hunger Games trilogy came from the classical account of Theseus and the Minotaur. In Greek mythology, as a punishment for the killing of King Minos's son Androgeos, Athens was forced to sacrifice seven youths and seven maidens to Crete, who were <b>then</b> <b>put</b> in the Labyrinth and killed by the Minotaur. After a while, Theseus, the son of the Athenian king, decided {{to put an end to}} the Minotaur and Minos's terror, so he volunteered to join the third group of victims, ultimately killing the Minotaur and leading his companions out of the monster's Labyrinth.|$|E

An old woman saved him and a few others. As mark of great reverence, which in Mongolia is considered a highly sacred mountain of spiritual significance, and to the sun above, he offered his respects to {{the spirits of the}} mountain around him, sprayed milk into the air and sprinkled it on the earth. He removed his girdle strap, unwinding it from his outfit, and <b>then</b> <b>put</b> it around his neck. Symbolically by this act he surrendered his Mongolian man's pride and expressed his submission to the gods.|$|E
5|$|Hansa {{had a short}} career during World War I. At the {{outbreak}} of hostilities, she was briefly mobilized into the 5th Scouting Group, which was tasked with training cadets in the Baltic Sea. By the end of 1914, however, the ships were again removed from service. She was <b>then</b> <b>put</b> into service as a coastal defense ship. After 1915, she was withdrawn from front-line duty again and employed as a barracks ship for the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel. She was stricken from the naval register on 6 December 1919 and sold to ship-breakers in Audorf-Rendsburg. She was scrapped the following year.|$|E
5|$|Haydn {{conceived}} of {{what became the}} Opus 50 set {{in a letter to}} the publishing house Artaria in 1784, although he <b>then</b> <b>put</b> the project on hold for the Paris symphonies and The Seven Last Words of Christ. He started work in 1787, composing the first two quartets in February. In April, Haydn received a letter from King Frederick William II of Prussia, praising Haydn for the copies of the Paris symphonies that he had sent. The letter enclosed a golden ring. Haydn sought to return the favour by dedicating the Opus 50 set to the King, and Artaria acceded to Haydn's request to do so.|$|E

5|$|In 1228 John Malemort, William the Smith and William the Fletcher {{arrived at}} the castle and began {{production}} operations at a forge built within the bailey. A production level of 120,000 quarrels in a 120-day period was achieved by 1233, with men like Malemort being able to produce up to 100quarrels a day. Quarrels were <b>then</b> <b>put</b> into barrels and shipped across the kingdom in large quantities. Other iron from the castle was sent to build siege engines in Hereford. The manufacturing capability of St Briavels Castle gave the king a distinct advantage over potential baronial enemies, with the supply of arms from the castle to Marcher Lords threatened by the Welsh {{being one of the}} levers of royal power during the period.|$|E
5|$|Lampard <b>then</b> <b>put</b> Chelsea 3–2 ahead, but Hargreaves {{levelled}} {{things up}} with a shot into the top corner. Ashley Cole was the next up, and Van der Sar got a strong hand to the ball but could not keep it out. Nani then {{knew he had to}} score to keep United in it, and he did, leaving it up to John Terry to win the cup for Chelsea; however, Terry lost his footing when planting his standing foot by the ball, and, even though Van der Sar was sent the wrong way, Terry's mis-hit effort struck the outside of the right post and went wide.|$|E

While she was being towed down the coast (under command of her fourth captain, Commander John P. Bankhead), the wind increased and with it the waves; with no high sides, the Monitor took on water. Soon the water in the hold gained on the pumps, and <b>then</b> <b>put</b> out the fires in her engines. The order was given to abandon ship; most men were rescued by , but 16 went down with her when she sank in the early hours of December 31, 1862.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery and {{his troops}} {{spent the first}} night near the landing area, under light fire from the British guns. The next morning, he ordered Major Timothy Bedel to occupy a {{position}} north of the fort, but when Montgomery saw that his men were apprehensive, he chose to lead the mission himself. As Montgomery led his troops, they came upon a fight between British troops and another American party. Montgomery took command of the skirmish and forced the British party back into the fort. Montgomery sent Bedel with a force to entrench themselves about a mile north of the fort. Montgomery <b>then</b> <b>put</b> other troops around the fort and began a siege.|$|E

During its peak of construction activities {{in the summer of}} 2006, more than 500 workers were involved both at the Sliding Centre and at the Whistler Nordic Venue (now Whistler Olympic Park). A core group of 60 workers was involved with track construction from June 2005 to December 2007. Basic track construction was completed in November 2007 though fit-out and testing continued into 2008.|$|E

5|$|The {{bodies were}} <b>then</b> <b>put</b> into trucks and {{were taken to}} a large burial pit, where they were left {{unattended}} long enough for Jednak to escape. It is estimated that 200 Serbs were killed that evening. Killings continued on 3 August, when the Ustaše murdered the inhabitants of Serb villages {{in the vicinity of}} the church. About one month later, the church was burned down by the Ustaše. Estimates of the number of Serbs killed from 30 July to 3 August vary widely. Sociologist Damir Mirković and historian Paul Mojzes state that 700 Serbs were killed. Journalist Tim Judah puts the number at 1,200, and historian Iván T. Berend writes that the Ustaše killed 1,800 people. Hoare writes that as many as 2,000 Serbs were murdered.|$|E
