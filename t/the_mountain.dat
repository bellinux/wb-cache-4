5|$|One major {{challenge}} was {{the approach to}} the museum. The Japanese team proposed a winding road up <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> not unlike the approach to the NCAR building in Colorado. Instead, Pei ordered a hole cut through a nearby mountain, connected to a major road via a bridge suspended from ninety-six steel cables and supported by a post set into <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> The museum itself was built into <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> with 80percent of the building underground.|$|E

5|$|Due to its remoteness, Sangay hosts a {{significant}} biological community with fauna such as <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> tapir, giant otter, Andean cock-of-the-rock and king vulture.

5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} {{observed}} at <b>the</b> <b>mountain.</b> However, this is often not recorded as an eruption as the information was insufficient to identify it as such.

5|$|Once it was {{determined}} that <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> was the highest point in the region, the succession of the authorities that held control over it took an interest in its name and changed it periodically for symbolic reasons. In 1896, as part of Austria-Hungary, the highest peak of the Carpathians received its first government-sponsored name − after the contemporary head of state Emperor Francis Joseph I. Guidebooks sometimes did not catch up on these name changes. After the dissolution of the monarchy in 1918, <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> continued to be known simply as Gerlachovský štít because it belonged to the village of Gerlachov. The Polish government, claiming the territory of the High Tatras for Poland, simultaneously called <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> Szczyt Polski (Polish Peak), but never gained control over it. The new Czechoslovak government changed the name to Štít legionárov (Legionnaires Peak) in honor of the Czechoslovak Legions in 1923, but the name was dropped in favor of the earlier Gerlachovský štít in 1932. As a result of the Communist coup d'état in 1948, <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> was renamed once more − to Stalinov štít (Stalin Peak) in 1949. Its traditional name Gerlachovský štít was restored yet again a decade later and has remained unchanged through the present.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 03 The thesis {{seeks to}} develop an {{architectural}} form that helps create {{an awareness of the}} historic relationship between <b>the</b> Baiyun <b>mountains</b> and Guangzhou city. Their physical connection has existed since the city’s foundation. However, as the city has grown, the spiritual connection with <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> has decreased. With a dense population and vast urbanized area, <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> are at risk of being neglected by Guangzhou’s urban dwellers. Instead, they treat <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> as a place for entertainment. The result is <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> have become merely a consumptive resource for the city. This thesis will reconnect <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> and <b>the</b> city through creating a dialogue. The dialogue embraces the differences and argues for the necessity of a new relationship between <b>the</b> <b>mountains</b> and <b>the</b> city...|$|R
