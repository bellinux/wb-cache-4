2500|$|The anime {{adaptation}} of the series has received critical acclaim by reviewers. Jacob Hope Chapman from Anime News Network praised the cast and studio Bones' work. Additionally, he liked the consistency in quality and commented [...] "The contiguous threads laced through these episodic adventures are beginning to converge fast, and while I can't see the full picture yet, I know Rie Matsumoto is building the anime-original material of Leo's romance into something special. The animation continues to be jaw-dropping. The music continues to be soul-warming. There's never enough time in one writeup to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> that makes the episode so damn good. Blood Blockade Battlefront continues to be The Very Best." [...] Jarius Taylor from the Fandom Post called it [...] "both ridiculously cool and ridiculously weird" [...] and praised the cast like Chapman. In a later review he said [...] "It’s still not entirely clear what this show is going for yet but for now it’s a good ride and I have more than enough faith in the people behind it to believe the destination will be worthwhile." [...] Rachael Verret, a writer from The Mary Sue, gave the series a perfect score having pointed out its [...] "energy and joviality" [...] seen through the cast and the ending sequences which reminded her of another series, Baccano!. Similarly, Chapman wrote an article titled [...] "Three Reasons Why Blood Blockade Battlefront is the Best Show of the Spring" [...] commenting [...] "It's the coolest, cutest, and cleverest anime I've {{seen in a long}} time, easily the best new show of the Spring 2015." ...|$|E

Look how kind {{he is to}} all the poor in the village, {{and how much he}} thinks about their comfort and welfare. And whenever he's talking with one, he seems so anxious to make you feel happy and contented with yourself. He has a sort of little subtle flattery of manner about him that's all pure kindliness; and he's always thinking what he can say or do to please you, and to help you onward. What you say about his dwelling on enjoyment so much is really only his artistic sensibility. He feels things so keenly, and enjoys beauty so deeply, that he can't help talking enthusiastically about it even a little out of season. He has more feelings to display than most men, and I'm sure that's the reason why he displays them so much. A ploughboy could only talk enthusiastically about roast beef and dumplings; Mr. Dene can <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> that's beautiful and sublime on earth or in heaven." ...|$|E

[...] This man used to call regularly {{once a week and}} dun me, and sometimes oftener. He did it from sheer force of habit, for he knew he could get nothing. He would get out his bill, calculate the interest for me, at five per cent a month, and show me clearly that there was no attempt at fraud in it and no mistakes; and then plead, and argue and dun with all his might for any sum--any little trifle--even a dollar--even half a dollar, on account. Then his duty was accomplished and his conscience free. He immediately dropped the subject there always; got out a couple of cigars and divided, put his feet in the window, and then we would have a long, luxurious <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> and everybody, and he would furnish me a world of curious dunning adventures out of the ample store in his memory.

I’ve got plenty of {{delicacy}} when people are nice to me. Ask Arthur Demesne if I ain’t delicate—ask George Littlemore if I ain’t. Don’t stand there all day; come on to lunch!” And Mrs. Headway resumed her walk while her companion, having balanced, slowly overtook her. “Wait till I get settled; then I’ll be delicate,” she pursued. “You can’t be delicate when you’re trying to save your life. It’s very well for you to talk, with the whole State Department to back you. Of course I’m excited. I’ve got right hold of this thing, and I don’t mean to let go!” Before they reached the house she let him know why he {{had been invited to}} Longlands {{at the same time as}} herself. Waterville would have liked to believe his personal attractions sufficiently explained the fact, but she took no account of this supposition. Mrs. Headway preferred to see herself in an element of ingenious machination, where everything that happened referred to her and was aimed at her. Waterville had been asked then because he represented, however modestly, the American Legation, and their host had a friendly desire to make it appear that his pretty American visitor, of whom no one knew anything, was under the protection of that establishment. “It would start me better,” the lady in question complacently set forth. “You can’t help yourself—you’ve helped to start me. If he had known the Minister he’d have asked him—or the first secretary. But he don’t know them.” ...|$|E
60|$|During {{the three}} months she had been here she had made up considerably, as Helen meant she should, for time spent in interminable walks round {{sheltered}} gardens, and the household gossip of her aunts. But Mrs. Ambrose {{would have been the}} first to disclaim any influence, or indeed any belief that to influence was within her power. She saw her less shy, and less serious, which was all to the good, and the violent leaps and the interminable mazes which had led to that result were usually not even guessed at by her. Talk was the medicine she trusted to, <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>everything,</b> talk that was free, unguarded, and as candid as a habit of talking with men made natural in her own case. Nor did she encourage those habits of unselfishness and amiability founded upon insincerity which are put at so high a value in mixed households of men and women. She desired that Rachel should think, and for this reason offered books and discouraged too entire a dependence upon Bach and Beethoven and Wagner. But when Mrs. Ambrose would have suggested Defoe, Maupassant, or some spacious chronicle of family life, Rachel chose modern books, books in shiny yellow covers, books {{with a great deal of}} gilding on the back, which were tokens in her aunt's eyes of harsh wrangling and disputes about facts which had no such importance as the moderns claimed for them. But she did not interfere. Rachel read what she chose, reading with the curious literalness of one to whom written sentences are unfamiliar, and handling words as though they were made of wood, separately of great importance, and possessed of shapes like tables or chairs. In this way she came to conclusions, which had to be remodelled according to the adventures of the day, and were indeed recast as liberally as any one could desire, leaving always a small grain of belief behind them.|$|E

It was just a field; {{but there was a}} clump of white birches in it, right where that big, {{spreading}} tree of Uncle Alec's is now, and Emily liked to sit among the ferns under the birches and read or sew. She had a lover. His name was Malcolm Ward and he was as handsome as a prince. She loved him with all her heart and he loved her the same; but they had never spoken about it. They used to meet under the birches and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>everything</b> except love. One day he told her he was coming the next day to ask A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION, and he wanted to find her under the birches when he came. Emily promised to meet him there. I am sure she stayed awake that night, thinking about it, and wondering what the important question would be, although she knew perfectly well. I would have. And the next day she dressed herself beautifully in her best pale blue muslin and sleeked her curls and went smiling to the birches. And while she was waiting there, thinking such lovely thoughts, a neighbour's boy came running up--a boy who didn't know about her romance--and cried out that Malcolm Ward had been killed by his gun going off accidentally. Emily just put her hands to her heart--so--and fell, all white and broken among the ferns. And when she came back to life she never cried or lamented. She was CHANGED. She was never, never like herself again; and she was never contented unless she was dressed in her blue muslin and waiting under the birches. She got paler and paler every day, but the pink butterfly grew redder, until it looked just like a stain of blood on her white cheek. When the winter came she died. But next spring"--the Story Girl dropped her voice to a whisper that was as audible and thrilling as her louder tones--"people began to tell that Emily was sometimes seen waiting under the birches still. Nobody knew just who told it first. But more than one person saw her. Grandfather saw her {{when he was a little}} boy. And my mother saw her once." ...|$|E

[...] Longmore said nothing and M. de Mauves puffed his cigar reflectively and watched the smoke. [...] "Madame de Mauves," [...] he said at last, [...] "is a rather singular person." [...] And then while our young man shifted his position and wondered whether {{he was going to}} [...] "explain" [...] Madame de Mauves, [...] "Being, as you are, her fellow countryman," [...] this lady's husband pursued, [...] "I don't mind speaking frankly. She's a little overstrained; the most charming woman in the world, as you see, but a little volontaire and morbid. Now you see she has taken this extraordinary fancy for solitude. I can't get her to go anywhere, to see any one. When my friends present themselves she's perfectly polite, but it cures them of coming again. She doesn't do herself justice, and I expect every day to hear two or three of them say to me, 'Your wife's jolie a croquer: what a pity she hasn't a little esprit.' You must have found out that she has really a great deal. But, to tell the whole truth, what she needs is to forget herself. She sits alone for hours poring over her English books and looking at life through that terrible brown fog they seem to me--don't they?--to fling over the world. I doubt if your English authors," [...] the Count went on with a serenity which Longmore afterwards characterised as sublime, [...] "are very sound reading for young married women. I don't pretend to know much about them; but I remember that not long after our marriage Madame de Mauves undertook to read me one day some passages from a certain Wordsworth--a poet highly esteemed, it appears, chez vous. It was as if she had taken me by the nape of the neck and held my head for half an hour over a basin of soupe aux choux: I felt as if we ought to ventilate the drawing-room before any one called. But I suppose you know him--ce genie-la. Every nation has its own ideals of every kind, but when I remember some of OUR charming writers! I think at all events my wife never forgave me and that it was a real shock to her to find she had married a man who had very much the same taste in literature as in cookery. But you're a man of general culture, a man of the world," [...] said M. de Mauves, turning to Longmore but looking hard at the seal of his watchguard. [...] "You can <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>everything,</b> and I'm sure you like Alfred de Musset as well as Monsieur Wordsworth. Talk to her about everything you can, Alfred de Musset included. Bah! I forgot you're going. Come back then as soon as possible and report on your travels. If my wife too would make a little voyage it would do her great good. It would enlarge her horizon"--and M. de Mauves made a series of short nervous jerks with his stick in the air--"it would wake up her imagination. She's too much of one piece, you know--it would show her how much one may bend without breaking." [...] He paused a moment and gave two or three vigorous puffs. Then turning to his companion again with eyebrows expressively raised: [...] "I hope you admire my candour. I beg you to believe I wouldn't say such things to one of US!" ...|$|E
