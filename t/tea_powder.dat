25|$|Matcha Like gyokuro, matcha is shaded before plucking. The plucked and {{processed}} leaf is called tencha. This product is then ground into a fine powder, which is matcha. Because the <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> is very perishable, matcha is usually sold in small quantities. It is typically rather expensive. Matcha {{is the type}} of tea used in the Japanese tea ceremony. It is prepared by whisking the tea with hot water in a bowl, until the surface is frothy. If the water is too hot, the tea may become overly bitter.|$|E
25|$|To {{produce a}} tea brick, ground or whole tea is first steamed, then placed {{into one of}} a number of types of press and {{compressed}} into a solid form. Such presses may leave an intended imprint on the tea, such as an artistic design or simply the pattern of the cloth with which the tea was pressed. Many powdered tea bricks are moistened with rice water in pressing to assure that the <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> sticks together. The pressed blocks of tea are then left to dry in storage until a suitable degree of moisture has evaporated.|$|E
2500|$|Compressed tea is {{prepared}} by loosening {{leaves from the}} cake using a small knife, and steeping the extracted pieces in water. During the Tang dynasty, as described by Lu Yu, compressed tea was ground into a powder, combined with hot water, and ladled into bowls, resulting in a [...] "frothy" [...] mixture. In the Song dynasty, the <b>tea</b> <b>powder</b> would instead be whisked with hot water in the bowl. Although no longer practiced in China today, the whisking method of preparing powdered tea was transmitted to Japan by Zen Buddhist monks, and is still used to prepare matcha in the Japanese tea ceremony.|$|E

40|$|Liquid chromatographic methods with UV and {{fluorescence}} detection {{have been used}} to determine the levels of (+) -catechin, (−) -epicatechin, (−) -epicatechin gallate, and (−) -epigallocatechin gallate in Korean green tea infusions. The extracts of Korean green <b>tea</b> leaves or <b>powders</b> in water at various temperatures (100 °C, 80 °C, 60 °C) and time, were washed with chloroform and re-extracted to ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate phase was dried and re-dissolved in methanol and analyzed. Five catechin compounds were separated by gradient elution. The flavonoids were found decomposed on prolonged extraction, thus exhaustive extraction by a Soxhlet apparatus was found useless for green tea. Some unknown components were found in the extracts at 100 o C. When the green tea was filtered and re-extracted with new fresh water, still some flavonoids were extracted. However, the contents of flavonoids in the third extract were found negligible. The flavonoid extraction rate of green <b>tea</b> <b>powders</b> was higher than that of green tea leaves, but flavonoid decomposition of green <b>tea</b> <b>powders</b> was also faster than that of green tea leaves. The traditional way of drinking green tea was found appropriate in view of flavonoids intake...|$|R

40|$|Increasing {{attention}} has been paid to Benifuuki green tea for its potential clinical uses. The present studyinvestigated the effects of Benifuuki green <b>tea</b> leaf <b>powder</b> and its extract on growth, tissue weight and plasmacomponents in high-cholesterol diet-fed rats.
