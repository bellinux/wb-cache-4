40|$|The Variable Acuity Remote Viewing System (VARVS), {{originally}} developed {{under contract to}} the Navy (ONR) as a laboratory brassboard, was modified for flight demonstration. The VARVS system was originally conceived as a technique which could circumvent the acuity/field of view/bandwidth tradeoffs that exists in remote viewing to provide a nearly eye limited display in both field of view (160 deg) and resolution (2 min arc) while utilizing conventional TV sensing, transmission, and <b>display</b> <b>equipment.</b> The modifications for flight demonstration consisted of modifying the sensor {{so it could be}} installed and flow in a Piper PA 20 aircraft, equipped for remote control and modifying the <b>display</b> <b>equipment</b> so it could be integrated with the NASA Research RPB (RPRV) remote control cockpit...|$|R
40|$|This stu & was {{conducted}} to determine the speed and accurag of form recognition as a function of: (I) the amount of distortion between the reference form and the target form, (2) the number of irrelevant forms in the <b>target</b> <b>display,</b> and (3) the stimulus properties of the forms involved. The stimulus forms were generated by filling in, on a statistical basis, some of the cells of a 90, 000 -cell matrix. The subjects were shown a reference photograph of a target and instructed to locate that <b>target</b> on a <b>display</b> containing numerous other forms. Both criterion measures, vix., search time and errors, increased as a function oJ (1) {{an increase in the}} number of irrelevant forms on the <b>target</b> <b>display,</b> and (2) an increase in the dzference between the resolution of the reference form and that of the <b>target</b> <b>display.</b> A quantitative descrz) tion of the targets, which can be used to predict relative target dzjiculo, was developed. 1...|$|R

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} examine whether attentional set affects the ability of visual transients (onsets and offsets) to capture attention. In the experiments, visual search for an identity-defined target was conducted. In the first 3 experiments, the <b>target</b> <b>display</b> either onset entirely or was revealed by offsetting camouflaging line segments to reveal letters. Prior to the <b>target</b> <b>display,</b> there was a noninformative cue, either an onset or an offset, {{at one of the}} potential target locations. Cues that shared the same transient feature as the <b>target</b> <b>display</b> captured attention. The lack of predictable target transients led to attentional capture by all forms of transients. The final experiments with luminance changes without offsets or onsets showed attentional capture when the luminance changes were large. The results suggest that attentional set can be broadly or narrowly tuned to detect changes in luminance...|$|R

40|$|Tone Mapping of HDR Images {{has been}} studied {{extensively}} since the introduction of digital HDR capture methods. However, until recently HDR video {{has not been realized}} in a viable form as that given by Tocci et al. [1], which will lead to readily available HDR video cameras. Because they capture video with much broader dynamic range than can currently be displayed, these cameras present a unique challenge. In order to maintain backward-compatibility with legacy broadcast, recording, and <b>display</b> <b>equipment,</b> HDR video cameras need to provide a real-time tonemapped LDR video stream without the benefit of post-processing steps. The purpose of this research is to present a complete TMO solution that can be implemented in real time hardware to yield a high-quality automated LDR video stream suitable for direct use by today’s recording, broadcast, and <b>display</b> <b>equipment.</b> Index Terms — HDR, TMO, video 1...|$|R
