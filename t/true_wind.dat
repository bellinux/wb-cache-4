5|$|Mariners {{have a way}} {{to safely}} {{navigate}} around tropical cyclones. They split tropical cyclones in two, based on their direction of motion, and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (the left in the Southern Hemisphere). Sailors term the right side the dangerous semicircle since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm, as the cyclone's translation speed and its rotational wind are additive. The other half of the tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle since weather conditions are lessened (subtractive) in this portion of the storm (but are still potentially quite hazardous). The rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path (crossing the T). Those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the <b>true</b> <b>wind</b> on the starboard bow and make as much headway as possible. Ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the <b>true</b> <b>wind</b> on the starboard quarter while making as much headway as possible.|$|E
25|$|Sail-powered {{vehicles}} travel {{over land}} or ice at apparent wind speeds that {{are higher than}} the <b>true</b> <b>wind</b> speed, close-hauled on most points of sail. Both land yachts and ice boats have low forward resistance to speed and high lateral resistance to sideways motion.|$|E
500|$|In the event, {{neither the}} {{breakwater}} nor the railway were built, {{but the issue}} was re-examined by the 1858 British Parliamentary Select Committee on Harbours for Refuge. The select committee took evidence from many witnesses about harbours all around the country. For Padstow, evidence from Captain Claxton, RN, stated that without {{the removal of the}} sand, ships in distress could only use the harbour at high tide. The committee was told by J. D. Bryant, a port commissioner and Receiver of Wreck for Padstow, that in 1848 Padstow Harbour Association had cut down a small piece of Stepper Point, which had given ships about 50 fathoms of extra [...] "fair wind" [...] into the harbour. Bryant recommended further removal of the point which would allow a <b>true</b> <b>wind</b> along the whole channel past the dangerous sandbar.|$|E
50|$|Wind {{direction}} for {{points of sail}} always refers to the <b>true</b> wind—the <b>wind</b> felt by a stationary observer. The apparent wind—the wind felt by an observer on a moving sailing craft—determines the motive power for sailing craft.|$|R
50|$|Once a {{user defined}} flight route has been entered, {{entering}} additional information for each route leg such as <b>true</b> airspeed, <b>winds</b> aloft and local magnetic variation allows Notam Check to calculate distance, wind correction angle and estimated {{time of arrival}} for each leg.|$|R
40|$|A {{validation}} of the ERS scatterometer wind measurements is performed using a formalism recently proposed and already applied to NSCAT and QuikSCAT measurements. It uses a simple analytical model relating scatterometer measurements to <b>true</b> <b>winds,</b> taking into account errors in the satellite winds as well as errors in the data used for reference. In this study, NDBC buoys winds are taken for reference. In addition, ECMWF analysis winds are used as a third data source to completely determine the errors from a triple collocation analysis. As a particular result, it is obtained that the ERS scatterometer low winds are biased low, contrary to a standard regression analysis. It is further shown that ERS and NSCAT or QuikSCAT measurement accuracies are comparable...|$|R
2500|$|Aerodynamic {{forces on}} sails depend on wind speed and {{direction}} {{and the speed}} {{and direction of the}} craft ( [...] VB [...] ). The direction that the craft is traveling with respect to the <b>true</b> <b>wind</b> (the wind direction and speed over the surface – VT [...] ) is called the point of sail. The speed of the craft at a given point of sail contributes to the apparent wind ( [...] VA [...] )—the wind speed and direction as measured on the moving craft. The apparent wind on the sail creates a total aerodynamic force, which may be resolved into drag—the force component {{in the direction of the}} apparent wind—and lift—the force component normal (90°) to the apparent wind. Depending on the alignment of the sail with the apparent wind, lift or drag may be the predominant propulsive component. Total aerodynamic force also resolves into a forward, propulsive, driving force—resisted by the medium through or over which the craft is passing (e.g. through water, air, or over ice, sand)—and a lateral force, resisted by the wheels or ice runners of the vehicle.|$|E

60|$|The show farmer {{had taken}} his folk to church, but we {{friendly}} slipped through his gates and reached the silent, spick-and-span house, with its trim barn, and a vast mound of copper-coloured wheat, piled in the sun between two mounds of golden chaff. Every one thumbed a sample of it and passed judgment--it must have been worth a few hundred golden sovereigns as it lay, out on the veldt--and we sat around, on the farm machinery, and, in the hush that a shut-up house always imposes, we seemed to hear the lavish earth getting ready for new harvests. There was no <b>true</b> <b>wind,</b> but a push, as it were, of the whole crystal atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|The drawing below {{shows the}} vector {{operations}} and resulting calculations for sailing downwind. Alpha (α) is {{the angle of}} the sails to the apparent wind. Beta (β) is the course of the boat with respect to the <b>true</b> <b>wind.</b> The <b>true</b> <b>wind</b> is assumed to be equal to 1 in order to simplify the formulas. Note that the <b>true</b> <b>wind</b> is added to the head wind created by the boat's speed.|$|E
50|$|The {{points of}} sail at which sailing craft can achieve highest speeds span between a beam reach (90° to the <b>true</b> <b>wind)</b> and a broad reach (about 135° away from the <b>true</b> <b>wind).</b> Normal {{cruising}} boats yachts can sail at about 45° off the apparent wind (50° to 60° off the <b>true</b> <b>wind).</b> High performance racing yachts at about 27° (35° off the <b>true</b> <b>wind).</b> High-performance multihulls can sail at 20° off the apparent wind. Iceboats can sail even closer to the apparent wind. According to the data provided on p. 406 of the cited book High Performance Sailing, a fast keelboat such as a Soling can sail at 30° off the apparent wind, an 18ft Skiff at 20°, and an iceboat at 7°.|$|E
50|$|Note that, if a boat can {{accelerate}} {{until it}} is sailing at 45° off the apparent wind when sailing 135° off the <b>true</b> <b>wind,</b> then its speed is 1.41 times {{the speed of the}} <b>true</b> <b>wind.</b> Thus its velocity made good downwind is equal to the velocity of the <b>true</b> <b>wind.</b> If it can accelerate {{until it is}} sailing closer than 45° to the apparent wind, then its velocity made good downwind is greater than the velocity of the true wind: see section Velocity made good below.|$|E
40|$|Beam {{broadening}} {{effects on}} the Doppler radar spectrum induced by along- and cross-radar-beam winds are theoretically investigated in this article. Analytical expression of beam broadening spectrum for a vertical beam subject to a constant vertical wind {{in the absence of}} horizontal wind is derived first. We find that the resultant beam broadening spectral shape is in an exponential form, rather than a Gaussian shape. The peak of the exponential spectrum corresponds to the <b>true</b> vertical <b>wind</b> velocity, and the spectral width σ is a function of vertical wind velocity w and the half-power beam width θ 1 / 2 of the radar beam, in accordance with the expression σ= 0. 09 w θ 1 / 2 2. The beam broadening spectrum for a vertical radar beam subject to both vertical and horizontal winds is numerically studied, and the result shows that the spectral shape is distorted from the Gaussian form. The estimated vertical wind velocity of the distorted spectrum is very close to the <b>true</b> vertical <b>wind</b> velocity with a difference of less than 0. 6...|$|R

It blew lightly, however, and when the sun went down, had completely died away. In these circumstances Jarwin and his dog supped together, and then lay down to rest, full of sanguine hope.|$|R
5000|$|Apparent wind (VA) is the air {{velocity}} acting upon {{the leading edge}} of the most forward sail or as experienced by instrumentation or crew on a moving sailing craft. It is the vector sum of <b>true</b> <b>wind</b> velocity and the apparent wind component resulting from boat velocity (VA = -VB + VT). In nautical terminology, wind speeds are normally expressed in knots and wind angles in degrees. The crafts point of sail affects its velocity (VB) for a given <b>true</b> <b>wind</b> velocity (VT). Conventional sailing craft cannot derive power from the wind in a [...] "no-go" [...] zone that is approximately 40° to 50° away from the <b>true</b> <b>wind,</b> depending on the craft. Likewise, the directly downwind speed of all conventional sailing craft is limited to the <b>true</b> <b>wind</b> speed.|$|E
50|$|<b>True</b> <b>wind</b> (VT) {{combines}} {{with the}} sailing crafts velocity (VB) {{to be the}} apparent wind velocity (VA), the air velocity experienced by instrumentation or crew on a moving sailing craft. Apparent wind velocity provides the motive power for the sails on any given point of sail. It varies from being the <b>true</b> <b>wind</b> velocity of a stopped craft in irons in the no-go zone to being faster than the <b>true</b> <b>wind</b> speed as the sailing crafts velocity adds to the true windspeed on a reach, to diminishing towards zero, as a sailing craft sails dead downwind.|$|E

40|$|The {{pitfalls of}} the present method of {{reducing}} surface pressure to sea level are reviewed, and an alternative, adjusted pressure, P, is proposed. P is obtained from solution of a Poisson equation over a continental region, using the simplest boundary condition along the perimeter or coastline where P equals the sea level pressure. The use of P would avoid the empiricisms and disadvantages of pressure reduction to sea level, and would produce surface pressure charts which depict the <b>true</b> geostrophic <b>wind</b> at the surface...|$|R

50|$|Suppose that a boat is at a standstill, {{then starts}} to sail {{on a course}} that is 135° off the <b>true</b> <b>wind</b> (the value 135° is chosen for this {{explanation}} {{in order to simplify}} certain calculations). The boat accelerates, so the apparent wind is less than the <b>true</b> <b>wind</b> and shifts forward of the <b>true</b> <b>wind.</b> If the boat can reach a speed equal to about 71% of the true windspeed, then the apparent wind is perpendicular to the boat's course and its speed is about 71% of the true windspeed. If that reduced apparent windspeed still generates sufficient force to overcome the resistance of the surface, then the boat continues to accelerate.|$|E

50|$|For example, a boat can sail {{a course}} that is {{perpendicular}} to the <b>true</b> <b>wind</b> (that is, at 90° {{with respect to the}} <b>true</b> <b>wind).</b> As it accelerates, the wind as seen from the boat increases and the wind appears to shift forward. This is the same effect that causes rain to appear to fall at an angle when seen from a moving car, and is analogous to the astronomical phenomenon of aberration of light.|$|E
6000|$|But various causes {{arise in}} the actual {{practice}} of navigation to prevent a ship keeping her <b>true</b> course. <b>Winds</b> may be contrary, and currents may drive her either to the {{one side or the other}} of it; while land-- promontories, islands, and shallows--compel her to deviate from the direct line. A vessel also makes what is called [...] "leeway;" [...] which means that, when the wind blows on her side, she not only advances forward, but also slides through the water sidewise. Thus, in the course of a day, she may get a considerable distance off her true course--in sea parlance, [...] "make a good deal of leeway." ...|$|R

60|$|The {{situation}} {{really would}} have been favorable had we {{not been in the}} path of the storm. <b>True,</b> the <b>wind</b> itself tore our canvas out of the gaskets, jerked out our topmasts, and made a raffle of our running-gear, but still we would have come through nicely had we not been square in front of the advancing storm-centre. That was what fixed us. I was in a state of stunned, numbed, paralyzed collapse from enduring the impact of the wind, and I think I was just about ready to give up and die when the centre smote us. The blow we received was an absolute lull. There was not a breath of air. The effect on one was sickening.|$|R
