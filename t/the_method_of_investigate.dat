It is shown that the Poincare mapping along phase trajectories of the system in the neighbourhood of a fixed point, corresponding to periodic motion, is in general piecewise-differentiable: this neighbourhood divides into several sectors in which the Jacobians are different. For such mappings, theorems of stability in the first approximation are not applicable, and one has to devise new stability cn 1 eria. Several necessary conditions for stability are obtained, as well as sufficient conditions.

With the purposes of issuing a notice, an order, a charge, or to satisfy the burden of proof in civil proceedings, the standard <b>of</b> <b>investigating</b> water seepage has to one with high degree of certainty. Such standard is generally unachievable due to, inter alia, (a) inability to identify the source(s) /cause(s) of water seepage and (b) non-corporation of owners/occupiers of premises alleged of causing water seepage.

These interactions were studied in two separate experiments: the submersed weeds, Hydrilla verticillata (L. F.) Royle (Hydrocharitaceae) and an indigenous species, Lagarosiphon major (Ridley) Moss (Hydrocharitaceae) and; the floating weeds, Azolla filiculoides Lamarck (Azollaceae) and the indigenous Spirodela polyrhiza (L.) Schleid (Lemnaceae). Plants were grown under differing nutrient levels, and in an addition series of eight different densities, using the reciprocal yield model to estimate competitive ability. The invasive Hydrilla outcompeted Lagarosiphon in terms of mean length, dry mass, and survival. Major algal infestation in the high nutrient level of the Hydrilla/Lagarosiphon experiment altered light and nutrient conditions, which {{may have played a}} significant role in the lack of establishment of Lagarosiphon and the poor growth performance of Hydrilla. The invasive Azolla and indigenous Spirodela both performed well in terms of plant mass and increase in number. While Azolla was affected by intraspecific competition, it showed a steady increase in growth and multiplication with an increase in nutrients. The individual mass of Spirodela plants was highest in the low nutrient level, and multiplication rates were greatest in the high nutrient level. Results indicate that the susceptibility of indigenous plants may be increased in highnutrient systems, and that a continuous monitoring programme of aquatic alien species is vital in protecting our indigenous plants from extinction.
