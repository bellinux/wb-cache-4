5|$|Biological control {{techniques}} {{as we know}} them today started to emerge in the 1870s. During this decade, in the USA, the Missouri State Entomologist C. V. Riley and the Illinois State Entomologist W. LeBaron began within-state redistribution of parasitoids to control crop pests. The first international shipment of an insect as biological control agent was made by Charles V. Riley in 1873, shipping to France the predatory mites Tyroglyphus phylloxera to help fight <b>the</b> <b>grapevine</b> phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae) that was destroying grapevines in France. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) initiated research in classical biological control following the establishment of the Division of Entomology in 1881, with C. V. Riley as Chief. The first importation of a parasitoidal wasp into the United States was that of the braconid Cotesia glomerata in 1883–1884, imported from Europe to control the invasive cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae. In 1888–1889 the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis, a lady beetle, was introduced from Australia to California to control the cottony cushion scale, Icerya purchasi. This had become a major problem for the newly developed citrus industry in California, {{but by the end of}} 1889 the cottony cushion scale population had already declined. This great success led to further introductions of beneficial insects into the USA.|$|E
5|$|The Ridge Route {{crosses the}} West Branch California Aqueduct with SR 138, {{splitting}} {{to the northwest}} on Gorman Post Road. It rejoins the path of I-5 at Gorman, and, from Gorman to the end at Grapevine, most of the old road has been covered over by the Ridge Route Alternate or I-5. The path of the Ridge Route is now named Peace Valley Road and Lebec Road, passing over Tejon Pass and past Lebec and Fort Tejon. Past Fort Tejon, the route descends through Grapevine Canyon to Grapevine (named for grapevines in the area). The best-known curve on the road, Deadman's Curve or Death Curve, is visible from Digier Road {{on the west side}} of I-5. The next part of the old road that still exists is near the bottom of the grade, where a number of curves brought the road down to Grapevine. The original plan was to build the road nearer to the center of the canyon, but a March1914 flood destroyed the work, and the grading was redone higher up. Deadman's Curve and <b>the</b> <b>Grapevine</b> loops were both bypassed by the Ridge Route Alternate, which was built directly over most of the old road in this area. At Grapevine, the land suddenly flattens out, and the road north of Grapevine was the longest straight section of road in the state——in 1926. Most of this road lies under I-5 and SR 99, but the southernmost piece in Grapevine was bypassed by the Alternate, and is now in the median of I-5.|$|E

3000|$|Leaf galling {{phylloxera}} {{incidence and}} damage were mainly associated to the cultivar (Table  3). The difference between vineyards {{might be due}} to plant vigor; overall, <b>the</b> <b>grapevines</b> at <b>the</b> Progreso site were younger (Table  1) and growing in a more fertile soil without previous grapevine history that made <b>the</b> <b>grapevines</b> unevenly balanced with exuberant sprouting. This finding coincides with the observations of Strapazzon and Girolami (1983 for Italy and Molnár et al. (...) 2009) for Hungary, who reported leaf galls on vigorous plants of V. vinifera. However, we do not reject the hypothesis that different biotypes exist in both vineyards, which is now being studied (unpublished data).|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>grapevine</b> was {{introduced}} to Australia in the 19th century and was mostly a bulk wine producing grape. The particular clones planted in Australia were of poor quality and highly susceptible to coulure, frost and downy mildew. By {{the mid to late}} 20th century, many acres of Malbec were uprooted and planted with different varieties. By 2000, there were slightly over 1,235 acres (500 hectares), with the Clare Valley having the most significant amount. As newer clones become available, plantings of Malbec in Australia have increased slightly.|$|E

Located in the shadow of Mount Aconcagua, the average vineyards in Mendoza are planted at altitudes 1,970-3,610 feet (600-1,100 meters) above sea level. The soil of the region is sandy and alluvial on top of clay substructures and the climate is continental with four distinct seasons that affect <b>the</b> <b>grapevine,</b> including winter dormancy.|$|E

50|$|The {{history of}} downy mildew control {{began with an}} {{accidental}} discovery in 1882. In order to prevent passersby from eating <b>the</b> <b>grapevines</b> close to <b>the</b> road, Pierre-Marie-Alexis Millardet sprayed those vines {{with a mixture of}} copper sulfate and lime, which was both seeable and awful-tasting. He then noticed that <b>the</b> treated <b>grapevines</b> did not show any symptoms of downy mildew, whereas the rest of the vineyard was infected by the disease. After further studies, Millardet published the recommended treatment of <b>the</b> <b>grapevines</b> against <b>the</b> downy mildew in 1885 in which he proposed the use of 8:15:100 of copper sulfate: hydrated lime: water mixture in the treatment (later named as Bordeaux mixture after the Bordeaux region where Millardet conducted the research). The treatment of Bordeaux mixture against the downy mildew was well-received globally due to its strong adhesion to the leaves, its long perseverance in the vineyard, and its color, which allows for observable distribution of the treatment.|$|R
25|$|There is archaeological {{evidence}} to suggest that the Celts first cultivated <b>the</b> <b>grapevine</b> in Gaul. Grape pips have been found throughout France, pre-dating the Greeks and Romans, with some examples found near Lake Geneva dated to 10,000 BC. The extent to which the Celts and Gallic tribes produced wine is not clearly known, but the arrival of the Greeks near Massalia in 600 BC certainly introduced new types and styles of winemaking and viticulture. The limit of Greek viticultural influence was planting in regions with Mediterranean climates where olives and fig trees would also flourish.|$|E
25|$|Even if {{climate and}} {{vineyard}} management has been ideal, other factors may prevent full and even ripeness. Among the clusters of a grapevine, individual berries may not all ripen {{at the same}} pace. This problem, commonly known as millerandage, could occur because of poor weather during the flowering period of the grape but can also be caused by soil deficient in various nutrients such as boron, an attack of various grapevine ailments such as <b>the</b> <b>grapevine</b> fanleaf virus or {{a number of other}} factors that may contribute to incomplete plant fertilization.|$|E
25|$|The {{role that}} climate plays in {{influencing}} the ripening process cannot be overstated, {{but it is}} not the only factor. Vineyard management such as pruning and canopy management can also play a significant role as it not only influences the physiological processes of <b>the</b> <b>grapevine</b> but also how the vine responds in sharing its limited resources of energy and nutrients. The leaves of a grapevine produce energy via the process of photosynthesis. A certain amount of foliage is needed to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>grapevine</b> can produce enough energy to support all its physiological functions, but too much leaf cover will shade the grape clusters, limiting the direct exposure of sunlight and warmth needed for some chemical components of the grapes to develop. An excessive amount of foliage and shading may also promote the development of various vine diseases and ailments such as bunch rot and powdery mildew which can hamper the ripening process. A very vigorous vine with many clusters and vine shoots will have several parties competing for the same resources, with the overall development of an individual clusters thus slowed. Through the process of canopy management, viticulturists try to balance not only the amount of clusters and vine shoots on the vine but also try to achieve an optimal balance of needed foliage for photosynthesis without excessive shading that could hamper the ripening process.|$|E

25|$|In the vineyard, {{nitrogen}} {{is taken}} up by <b>the</b> <b>grapevine</b> as nitrate (NO3−), ammonium or urea which gets reduced into ammonia. Through additional reactions the nitrogen is incorporated into glutamine and glutamate and eventually used in the synthesis of other amino acids and nitrogenous compounds. After harvest, the majority (around 80%) of available nitrogenous compounds found in the grapes are concentrated in the skins and seeds. These compounds get released into the must {{during the process of}} crushing and during maceration/skin contact. Even after pressing up to 80% of initial nitrogen content within each grape berry will be left behind in the pomace.|$|E
25|$|Continental climates {{are usually}} seen in areas further inland from the coastal {{influences}} of oceans and large bodies of water. The {{difference from the}} average mean temperature of its coldest and hottest months can be quite significant with moderate precipitation that usually occurs {{in the winter and}} early spring. Depending on the water retaining ability of the soil <b>the</b> <b>grapevine</b> may receive enough water during this period to last throughout the growing season with little if any irrigation needed. For soils with poor water retention, the dry summer months may require some supplemental irrigation. Examples of continental climates that use supplemental irrigation include the Columbia Valley of Washington State and the Mendoza wine region of Argentina.|$|E
25|$|It {{was under}} these auspices that <b>the</b> <b>grapevine</b> {{followed}} land prospector John Howe as he cut {{a path through}} the Australian wilderness from Sydney up to the overland area in what is now known as the (Lower) Hunter Valley proper in 1820. Today, the modern Putty Road between the cities of Windsor and Singleton follows Howe's exact path and is a major thoroughfare for wine tourists coming into the Hunter Valley from Sydney. As previous plantings in the coastal areas around Sydney succumbed to the humidity and wetness, and plantings to the west were limited by spring frost damage, northern reaches leading to the Hunter became, almost by default, the wine region of the new colony.|$|E
