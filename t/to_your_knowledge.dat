6000|$|... "It is true," [...] said Richard, [...] "but how hath it come <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>knowledge,</b> my good friend? I {{deemed it}} known to none {{out of our}} house; not even the Earl and Countess guess that she is no child of ours." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "These {{imaginary}} kindred often give great uneasiness. I am glad your trouble hath {{no other}} source, for I {{had heard that}} the young heir of your house hath shown a prodigal disposition of late, and I feared that matter might have come <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>knowledge,</b> {{as one of the}} council, that a father might not wish to learn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your only servant {{is the man}} Grooton, {{for whom}} the Duke and I myself are {{prepared}} to vouch. You are also watched by detectives residing in the village, as I dare say you know.

60|$|Her {{eyes were}} deep blue, {{so deep that}} the casual {{observer}} would not at first recognise their colour. But when you had perceived that they were blue, and had brought the fact home <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>knowledge,</b> their blueness remained with you as a thing fixed for ever. And you would feel, if you yourself were thoughtful and contemplative, and much given to study a lady's eyes, that, such as they were, every lady would possess the like if only it were given to her to choose.|$|E

"If {{we were at}} Calcutta or Madras, {{there would}} be more scope for you in the civil service; but as we hold, at present, little {{territory}} beyond this island, there are therefore but few appointments affording an opportunity for the display of the intelligence which you certainly possess; but, should circumstances alter, you might, owing <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the country and its language, be told off for civil work, in which the emoluments are very much higher than in the military branch of the service.|$|E
60|$|And now, good reader, {{with regret}} {{we find that}} our tale has reached its close. We may not have added much <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>knowledge,</b> but if we have, in any degree, {{interested}} you in the characters we have summoned to our little stage, or in the incidents that have been enacted thereon, we shall not have wrought in vain, for the subject into which you have consented to dive with us {{is not only an}} interesting, but a dangerous one--involving as it does the constant risking of manly lives, the well-being of large communities, the progress of important industries, and the salvation of much valuable property to the world at large.|$|E
6000|$|I do not insist by {{any farther}} {{argument}} on this, for I {{think it should}} commend itself at once <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>knowledge</b> {{of what has been}} and to your feeling of what should be. You cannot think that the buckling on of the knight's armour by his lady's hand was a mere caprice of romantic fashion. It is the type of an eternal truth-- that the soul's armour is never well set to the heart unless a woman's hand has braced it; and it is only when she braces it loosely that the honour of manhood fails. Know you not those lovely lines--I would they were learned by all youthful ladies of England:- ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Aye, it {{all sounds}} well enough, I will acknowledge. You {{have been to}} Mackinaw to look about you, there, and having seen things with your own eyes, have started for Chicago <b>to</b> give <b>your</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>to</b> the commandant at that place. Now, redskin, have you any proof of what you say?" ...|$|R
60|$|And I take it, {{this is a}} type of our division; {{that you}} are one of those who have an eye for faults and failures; that you take a {{pleasure}} to find and publish them; and that, having found them, you make haste to forget the overvailing virtues and the real success which had alone introduced them <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>knowledge.</b> It is a dangerous frame of mind. That you may understand how dangerous, and into what a situation it has already brought you, we will (if you please) go hand-in-hand through the different phrases of your letter, and candidly examine each {{from the point of view}} of its truth, its appositeness, and its charity.|$|E

My present obligation merely binds me to tell you--in strict confidence, mind!--that Miss Silvester's secrets are no secrets to Mr. Delamayn. I leave to your discretion the use you may make of that information. You are now entirely on a par with me in relation <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the case of Miss Silvester. Let us return to the question which I asked you when we first came into the room. Do you see the connection, now, between that question, and what I have said since?" ...|$|E

'Here are you, Stephen Fitzmaurice Smith, living in London, but springing from Caxbury. Here {{in this book}} is a genealogical tree of the Stephen Fitzmaurice Smiths of Caxbury Manor. You may be only a family of professional men now--I am not inquisitive: I don't ask questions of that kind; {{it is not in}} me to do so--but it is as plain as the nose in your face that there's your origin!
