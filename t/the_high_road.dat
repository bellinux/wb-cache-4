5|$|Chiswick's Roman Catholic church, Our Lady of Grace and St Edward (the Confessor) in the Diocese of Westminster, lies on {{the corner}} of Dukes Avenue and <b>the</b> <b>High</b> <b>Road.</b> It is a red brick building; the parish was founded in 1848, a school began c. 1855, and a church was opened by Cardinal Wiseman on the present site in 1864. It was {{replaced}} by the present building in 1886, opened by Cardinal Manning. The heavy debts incurred were paid off and the church consecrated in 1904.

The 7th Brigade (General Brause) stood more to the left: it had only the 14th Regiment then present, for the 22nd Regiment and the Elbe Landwehr did not rejoin it until about 13:00. The 8th Brigade (Colonel Langen's) was ordered to remain on <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>road</b> leading from Sombreffe to Fleurus, until the arrival of the III Corps (Thielemann's).
