5|$|In the 15th century, York Castle, {{along with}} Nottingham Castle, was {{considered}} a key security asset {{in the north of}} England, but investment even in these castles diminished. Repairs to York Castle grew infrequent from 1400 onwards, and it fell into increasing disrepair. Richard III recognised the issue and in 1483 had some of the most decrepit structures removed, but he died at the battle of Bosworth before replacement work could commence. By the reign of Henry VIII, the antiquary John Leland reported that the castle was in considerable disrepair; nonetheless the water defences remained intact, unlike those of many other castles of the period. As a result of the deterioration, Henry had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>advised</b> that the king's councillors no longer had any official residence in which to stay and work when they were in York. The castle mint was shut down after the death of Edward VI in 1553, and the castle mills were given to a local charitable hospital in 1464. The hospital was then closed during the Reformation, and the mills passed into private ownership once again.|$|E

As a compromise, the regency was vested in the Dowager Princess of Wales, who considered him an enemy, but her powers were curtailed and she was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>advised</b> by a committee of twelve men, headed by Cumberland.|$|E

25|$|The seceded states laid {{claim to}} the {{national}} forts within their boundaries, {{but they did not}} make good their claim to Fort Sumter in South Carolina and Forts Pickens, Zachary Taylor, and Jefferson in Florida. They soon {{made it clear that they}} would use force if necessary to gain possession of Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens. President Abraham Lincoln resolved not to cede them without a fight. Secretary of State William H. Seward, Captain Montgomery C. Meigs of the US Army, and Porter devised a plan for the relief of Fort Pickens. The principal element of their plan required use of the steam frigate , which would be commanded by Porter and would carry reinforcements to the fort from New York. Because no one was above suspicion in those days, the plan had to be implemented in complete secrecy; not even Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>advised.</b>|$|E

[...] Our traveller paid a dime and descended to the museum, which he {{found to be the}} Hearst living quarters, faithfully preserved in their elegance: two of the rooms, usually occupied by Mr. Hearst and his secretary in the old days, fitted with mahogany furnishings, dark-red damask hangings, and notably soft and deep bedding accessories; and the third room, Mrs. Hearst's, in ivory and gilt with a bath which even now has gold-plated fittings. The curator of the museum is a young lady who chats interestingly about the Hearsts, dealing in both fact and surmise, and sells souvenir postals of the interior for ten cents each.|$|E

He received early warning of Stevenson's advance from Sandusky, but refused <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>advised,</b> and did not begin to retreat until his army was already circumvented. A characteristic anecdote is told of the surrender. [...] "General," [...] said Napoleon to his captor, [...] "you have to-day immortalised your name."
