You can so easily avenge yourself by collaborating with me! Our mixture would, I think, be effective. I hope you are thinking of doing Mars--in some detail. Let me in there, at the right moment--or in other words at an early stage. I really shall, opportunity serving, venture to try to say two or three things to you about the Two Men--or rather not so much about them as about the cave of conceptions whence they issue.

Anderson (Assistant Surgeon General, Chief, Communicable Disease Center) to "Public Health Officials and Others Concerned with Influenza. ""As Far East strains of influenza virus spread world wide, the rapid distribution of pertinent information is of maJor importance. The impressive forewarning provided by alert investigators in the present situation is remarkable and every advantage should be taken to maintain this lead. An effective reporting system through the National Office of Vital Statistics is now in operation. More frequent reports would greatly benefit those presently engaged in influenza activities. Consequently, the Communicable Disease Center plans to distribute at frequent intervals an "Influenza Report" which will contain pertinent laboratory information and epidemiolgic data relative to recent events. Dr. Keith E. Kensen, CDC Virus and Rickettsia Section, Montgomery, Alabama, and Dr. Robert H. Drachman, Influenza Surveillance Unit, CommunicableDisease Center, Atlanta, Georgia, w i l l prepare Jointly the "CDC: Influenza Report''. This will cover investigations of outbreaks with specific laboratory results and information on diagnostic techniques and reagents. Vaccine production and testing will also be included when available. These reports will be sent to State and Territorial Health Officers and Epdemiologists, all laboratories collaborating with the Influenza Center, abdd others involved in influenza activities. Because of its provisional nature, information contained in the Reports will not be for public release. Individualstates, of course, will judge the advisability of releasing their own data. Readily accessible, reasonably accurate and current data represent {{a major factor in the}} maintenance of an obJective view towards the influenza situation. With this vital consideration in mind, we will make every effort <b>to</b> <b>collaborate</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> in the present undertaking.

5000|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{involvement}} at CCRMA, the French Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM) offered Reynolds a commission and residency, which was followed up by two more residences {{over the course}} of two decades. When he first went to IRCAM, he made the choice to utilize technologically expert assistants to create software or hardware solutions to specific musical ideas inherent in his compositions. This practice has since spawned many collaborative ventures with various musical assistants, as Reynolds notes:When I went to IRCAM ... there was this concept of the Musical Assistant. ... I realized right away that this allowed me to make a choice: whether I would decide to spend a few years not composing and learning what I would need to do to become a self-sufficient computer-music composer or that I was going <b>to</b> <b>collaborate</b> <b>with</b> other people.collaboration: <b>You</b> enter into a relationship with one or more people and you have to sacrifice some of your autonomy and they have to sacrifice some of theirs {{in order to get to}} a place that you couldn’t get without each other. And I like that kind of situation.Archipelago (1982-83) was one of the first works that Reynolds did that used technology to drastically alter not only the sounds of the composition, but also the process of composing. The impetus was as the title suggests, a chain of islands, an idea which Reynolds elaborated on with a simultaneous theme and variations process. With fifteen themes and their own variations, distributed unevenly over a thirty-two member chamber orchestra, Reynolds needed technology to transform both the timbres and the order of the sounds in ways that live performers could not. This was the first time that Reynolds spent a great deal of time working with computers to transform musical material, along with spatialization, he used a process [...] "in which he was trying to take recognizable kernels and weave them into a mosaic of interacting transformations." [...] IRCAM was an extremely fertile environment for composition, allowing the Archipelago project to thrive:...The process composing the piece was interactive because I was at IRCAM and had the privilege of working with a very smart young composer, Thierry Lancino, who was my musical assistant, and also consulting with people like David Wessel and Stephen McAdams and so on. It was an astonishing opportunity. But in this case, the tie between the impetus, the medium, and the need for technology was absolutely clear. If one listens to the piece, one hears that technology was needed and also that it works.Odyssey (1989-93), primarily composed during the early 1990s, incorporates two singers, two speakers, instrumental ensemble, and six-channel computer sound. [...] "Odyssey required me to settle on an ideal set of multilingual Beckett texts by means of which to portray the course of his life." [...] There was a chaotic element in the text that Reynolds wished to portray in the music, and he undertook some of the first experiments with using strange attractors (specifically the Lorenz attractor) in music with this composition, citing influence from James Gleick. Reynolds notes that the process of creating musically beguiling results from a strange attractor was [...] "arduous" [...] and [...] "grueling." ...|$|R
