5|$|In July 2006 Krka {{was damaged}} during an {{overhaul}} at the Šibenik Shipyard. While being lowered to the sea, the winch of the syncrolift {{pulled out of}} the concrete causing the ship <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>down,</b> creating a hole in the hull and sinking the stern. Early reports of significant damage proved to be false and the ship was repaired soon after. Out of ten crew members that were on board at the time, only one sustained minor injuries.|$|E
5|$|Marseille {{developed}} his own special tactics, which differed {{significantly from the}} methods of most other pilots. (When attacking a Lufbery circle) he had to fly very slowly. He even {{took it to the}} point where he had to operate his landing flaps as not <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>down,</b> because, of course he had to fly his curve (turns) more tightly than the upper defensive circle. He and his fighter were one unit, and he was in command of that aircraft like no-one else.|$|E
5|$|On May 20, 2006, Barrett was {{involved}} in an infamous altercation with A. J. Pierzynski during the Chicago Crosstown Classic between the Chicago White Sox and Cubs. During the game's second inning, Brian Anderson hit a sacrifice fly, which allowed Pierzynski to score the game's first run. Pierzynski collided with Barrett en route to home plate, causing Barrett <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>down.</b> Pierzynski showed his enthusiasm by slapping home plate. As Pierzynski got up, he bumped into Barrett, who proceeded to punch him. Scott Podsednik came to Pierzynski's aid and subdued Barrett. Anderson and John Mabry eventually joined the brawl before both teams emptied their dugouts and stormed the field.|$|E

5|$|The 2008–09 season saw Napoli {{qualify for}} the UEFA Cup via the Intertoto Cup. However, the team was {{eliminated}} {{in the first round}} by Benfica. At the domestic level, Napoli made a very impressive start, proposing as one of the main candidates for a Champions League spot. However, results and performances quickly declined in mid-season, causing Napoli <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>down</b> to 11th place in the league table, which led to the dismissal of manager Edoardo Reja in March 2009; former Italy national team manager Roberto Donadoni appointed as his replacement.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot {{over a period}} six weeks at the Huntington Hartford Estate, on a small budget. The film {{did not have a}} large crew, and {{according}} to Webber, the actors were paid around $1000 for their performances. During the production, Nicol promised the actors a cut of the film's ultimate box office earnings, but due to an issue with the film's distributor, this never occurred. During filming, Webber discovered she was pregnant with a son, and so several scenes had to be re-written, like one where she was meant <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>down</b> a staircase.|$|E
5|$|Doggett first {{appears in}} the fifth episode. She wishes to hang up a cross in Litchfield Penitentiary's chapel but is refused permission. She ignores this and hangs her cross up on a light fixture; this causes the entire fixture <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>down</b> and hence damages the chapel's ceiling. She also {{displays}} transphobia; calling the transgender woman Sophia Burset (played by Laverne Cox) an 'abomination' and 'it' and blaming her for {{the damage to the}} chapel. Doggett has numerous clashes with Alex Vause (played by Laura Prepon); firstly Vause threatens to rape Doggett after growing tired of her complaining about Piper Chapman (played by Taylor Schilling); Doggett locks Vause in a dryer while she is helping Chapman to fix it and, lastly, Doggett snitches on Chapman and Vause for dancing provocatively with each other; resulting in Chapman being placed in solitary confinement.|$|E

5|$|The fourth {{match was}} for the vacant WWE Intercontinental Championship between Christian and Chris Jericho in a Ladder match. The two superstars brawled early into the match, but they then {{retrieved}} ladders and used them to their advantage. Christian was then able to gain control over the match after he performed a running enziguri onto Jericho. The two superstars then continued in a back and forth match, until Jericho applied the Walls of Jericho on Christian, {{on the top of}} the ladder, which caused Christian <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>down.</b> Jericho failed to retrieve the title on the first attempt, but was able to set up another ladder and successfully retrieved the title on the second attempt, thus Jericho winning the match and the WWE Intercontinental Championship for a record sixth reign at the time.|$|E

25|$|One {{reason for}} {{the large amount of}} {{casualties}} was that when the walls began <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>down,</b> the heavy roofs would collapse, leaving few air pockets in them.

The Iranian government promised to prosecute anyone who violated building regulations, even setting up a special unit to deal with the issue.|$|E

40|$|The {{wheelchair}} is {{the major}} means of transport for physically disabled people. However, it cannot overcome architectural barriers such as curbs and stairs. In this paper, the authors proposed a method <b>to</b> avoid <b>falling</b> <b>down</b> of a wheeled inverted pendulum type robotic wheelchair for climbing stairs. The problem of this system is that the feedback gain of the wheels cannot be set high due to modeling errors and gear backlash, which results in the movement of wheels. Therefore, the wheels slide down the stairs or collide with {{the side of the}} stairs, and finally the wheelchair <b>falls</b> <b>down.</b> <b>To</b> avoid <b>falling</b> <b>down,</b> the authors proposed a slider control strategy based on skyhook model in order to decrease the movement of wheels, and a rotary link control strategy based on the staircase dimensions in order to avoid collision or slide down. The effectiveness of the proposed fall avoidance control strategy was validated by ODE simulations and the prototype wheelchair...|$|R

However, if the explosion occurs after the tree falls down (that is, the first requirement is not met), or rather than an explosion, the person hears the ring of a telephone (that is, the second requirement is not met), then that person {{is not likely to}} infer that either noise caused the tree <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>down.</b>|$|E

New England came back before the halftime to retake the lead at 10–7 on a Dillon one-yard touchdown run. The Patriots maintained their lead as the teams traded touchdowns in the second half, including another touchdown by Jones-Drew. A David Garrard fumble with 1:55 left in the fourth quarter, recovered by safety Rodney Harrison, sealed the Patriots' 11th win of the season.|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} {{learning}} to ski for LW3 competitors with cerebral palsy is the American Teaching System. They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and {{how to put it}} on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, and then how <b>to</b> <b>fall</b> <b>down</b> and get back up again. The skier then learns how to do a straight run, and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift. This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use ski poles, and advanced parallel turns.|$|E
