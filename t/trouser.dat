Lectures were given in escape and evasion and troop commanders and NCO's were given small silk maps of Norway to help with any escape attempt. Another item of escape equipment issued was a pair of <b>trouser</b> fly buttons that, when placed {{one on top of the}} other, became a small compass.|$|E
5|$|The {{guidelines}} set by Judah Benjamin in 1861 {{soon became}} {{the choice of}} the clothing depots across the South as the war went into its second year. This easier-to-produce jacket, with the loosened hat and <b>trouser</b> regulations, made it easier to clothe Confederate infantrymen. The typical uniform by the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862 was a slouch hat or kepi, a shell-jacket, and a pair of sky-blue or gray cloth trousers, with brogans.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Sherlock allowed Jim Yoakum {{to start}} the Graham Chapman Archives. Later that year, the novel Graham Crackers: Fuzzy Memories, Silly Bits, and Outright Lies was released. It is a semi-sequel to A Liar's Autobiography, with Chapman's works {{compiled}} by Jim Yoakum. A compendium of writings, Calcium Made Interesting: Sketches, Letters, Essays & Gondolas, also compiled and edited by Yoakum was published in 2005 {{in association with the}} David Sherlock and John Tomiczeck trust. In 2000, Chapman's play O Happy Day was performed by Dad's Garage Theatre Company in Atlanta, Georgia, with the assistance of Cleese and Palin. In 2006, the album and DVD Looks Like Another Brown <b>Trouser</b> Job was released, featuring a college lecture recorded in April 1988.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} {{financial}} time-series prediction method consisting of á <b>Trous</b> wavelet transform and polynomial regression. The {{main purpose of}} employing á <b>Trous</b> wavelet transform is to decompose financial time-series signals into different resolutions where only relevant signal components are used for prediction. Also, á <b>Trous</b> wavelet transform is used to avoid the edge problem where only {{the past and present}} components of the time-series signal are taken into account. The decomposed time-series signals are then fed into the polynomial regression part to predict time-series signals. Using real-world financial data, performance evaluation is conducted based on total benefit and profit/loss where it is shown that á <b>Trous</b> wavelet transform contributes to a significant performance improvement...|$|R
40|$|KEY WORDS: Object-based {{image fusion}} (OBIF), {{statistical}} region merging and minimum heterogeneity rule (SRMMHR), Mallat’s, à <b>trous.</b> In this paper, a new object-based wavelet fusion technique is presented for {{the fusion of}} multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images to improve spatial information and preserve spectral information. The basic idea {{is to build a}} segmented label image by statistical region merging and minimum heterogeneity rule (SRMMHR) segmentation method to guide the object-based image fusion (OBIF). There are three key techniques of the OBIF method including SRMMHR segmentation, Mallat’s and à <b>trous</b> wavelet transformation, and fusion rule based on object energy. The results demonstrate that the new OBIF methods based on wavelet and PCA are better comparing with pixel-based image fusion methods such as Mallat’s, à <b>trous,</b> Mallat’s PCA, à <b>trous</b> PCA. 1...|$|R
5|$|The {{potential}} of the sticky bomb for physical humour has frequently proved too tempting to be neglected, a good example being David Niven's novel Go Slowly, Come Back Quickly. The unfortunate officer Stanni, while attempting to demolish a smelly privy, loses his dignity and a large section of <b>trouser</b> fabric to such an incident. The sticky bomb also featured in the British television comedy series Dad's Army. In the episode Fallen Idol Lance-Corporal Jack Jones sticks his grenade to an improvised target and retires as instructed but keeps a hold of the grenade which is now primed and stuck to an old dustbin lid.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} as he was collaborating with Stipe, and while still a member of Oh-OK, Sweet began writing songs for another project, the Buzz of Delight, which {{consisted}} of Sweet and former Oh-OK drummer David Pierce. In October 1983, they recorded a six-song EP, Soundcastles, released {{in the spring of}} 1984 on DB Records, and performed in New York, Florida and Georgia State to promote it. In the summer and November 1984, the Buzz of Delight recorded more songs, none of which were immediately released. (In 1990, one previously unreleased Buzz of Delight track appeared on the DB Records compilation Squares Blot out the Sun, and, in 2002, three others on To Understand.) Meanwhile, Stipe continued his work with R.E.M., who were getting acclaim and success with their album Murmur. In 1983, it was named album of the year by Rolling Stone and <b>Trouser</b> Press, and by the middle of 1984, it had sold 200,000 copies. In November 1983, R.E.M. began recording their follow-up, Reckoning.|$|E
5|$|Chinese Ming style {{clothing}} was forced on Vietnamese {{people by the}} Nguyễn dynasty. The tunics and <b>trouser</b> clothing of the Han Chinese on the Ming and Qing tradition was worn by the Vietnamese. However, Han-Chinese clothing is assembled by several pieces of clothing including both pants and skirts called Qun (裙) or chang (裳) which {{is a part of}} Hanfu garments throughout the history of Han Chinese clothing. The Ao Dai was created when tucks which were close fitting and compact were added in the 1920s to this Chinese style. The Chinese clothing in the form of trousers and tunic were mandated by the Vietnamese Nguyen government. It was up to the 1920s in Vietnam's north area in isolated hamlets where skirts were worn. The Chinese Ming dynasty, Tang dynasty, and Han dynasty {{clothing was}} referred to be adopted by Vietnamese military and bureaucrats by the Nguyen Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát (Nguyen The Tong). Chinese clothing started influencing Vietnamese dress in the Ly dynasty. The current Ao Dai was introduced by the Nguyen Lords.|$|E

5|$|Piper {{reported}} {{that as he}} was leaving Exchange Buildings to return to Houndsditch he saw a man acting suspiciously {{in the shadows of the}} cul-de-sac. As the policeman approached him, the man walked away; Piper later described him as being approximately , pale and fair-haired. When Piper reached Houndsditch he saw two policemen from the adjoining beats—constables Woodhams and Choate—who watched 120 Houndsditch and 11 Exchange Buildings while Piper went to the nearby Bishopsgate Police Station to report. By 11:30 seven uniformed and two plain clothes policemen had gathered in the locality, each armed with his wooden truncheon. Sergeant Bentley from Bishopsgate police station knocked at number 11, unaware that Piper had already done so, which alerted the gang. The door was answered by Gardstein, who made no response when Bentley asked if anyone was working there. Bentley asked him to fetch someone who spoke English; Gardstein left the door half-closed and disappeared inside. Bentley entered the hall with Sergeant Bryant and Constable Woodhams; as they could see the bottom of his <b>trouser</b> legs, they soon realised that someone was watching them from the stairs. The police asked the man if they could step into the back of the property, and he agreed. As Bentley moved forward, the back door opened and one of the gang exited, firing from a pistol as he did so; the man on the stairs also began firing. Bentley was shot in the shoulder and the neck—the second round severing his spine. Bryant was shot in the arm and chest and Woodhams was wounded in the leg, which broke his femur; both collapsed. Although they survived, neither Bryant or Woodhams fully recovered from their injuries.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, {{the only}} neck wear {{appropriate}} {{is the black}} bow tie that is a self-tie and should always match the lapel facing of the dinner jacket and braiding of the <b>trouser</b> seams.

25|$|Other {{variations}} in <b>trouser</b> style include {{the rise of}} the <b>trouser.</b> This was very high in the early half of the 20th century, particularly with formalwear, with rises above the natural waist, to allow the waistcoat covering the waistband to come down just below the narrowest point of the chest. Though serving less purpose, this high height was duplicated in the daywear of the period. Since then, fashions have changed, and have rarely been that high again with styles returning more to low-rise trousers, even dropping down to have waistbands resting on the hips. Other changing aspects of the cut include the length, which determines the break, the bunching of fabric just above the shoe when the front seam is marginally longer than height to the shoe's top. Some parts of the world, such as Europe, traditionally opt for shorter trousers with little or no break, while Americans often choose to wear a slight break.|$|E

25|$|In the Middle Ages, western men's {{underwear}} became looser fitting. The loincloth {{was replaced}} by loose, trouser-like clothing called braies, which the wearer stepped into and then laced or tied around the waist and legs at about mid-calf.

Braies (or rather braccae) were a type of <b>trouser</b> worn by Celtic and Germanic tribes in antiquity and by Europeans subsequently into the Middle Ages.

40|$|We seek to {{demonstrate}} a connection between refinable quasi-affine systems and the discrete wavelet transform known as the a ̀ <b>trous</b> algorithm. We begin with an introduction of the bracket product, which is the major tool in our analysis. Using multiresolution operators, we then proceed to reinvestigate the equivalence of the duality of refinable affine frames and their quasi-affine counterparts associated with a fairly general class of scaling functions that includes the class of compactly sup-ported scaling functions. Our methods show that for negative scales {{only one of the}} generalized Smith-Barnwell equations is actually needed to establish the additivity property of the quasi-affine multiresolution operators. This fact is then identified with the a ̀ <b>trous</b> algorithm thereby illustrating the connection with quasi-affine sys-tems. We then introduce the notion of a generalized quasi-affine (GQA) system, in which separate generating wavelets are used for non-negative and negative dila-tions. Sufficient conditions are described for two GQA systems to constitute dual frames, providing a means for the construction of frames from appropriate a ̀ <b>trous</b> systems. We conclude with a brief discussion of examples of GQA frames associ-ated with two different biorthogonal wavelet systems. The novelty of this work is the connection established between the a ̀ <b>trous</b> algorithm and refinable quasi-affine systems together with the notion of GQA systems, which are introduced to exploit this connection. 1...|$|R
