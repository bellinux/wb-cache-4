500|$|Is it {{reasonable}} for a highly efficient producer to reduce output, while {{the producer of}} poor efficiency continues to produce? That is crooked logic. If I reduce, what happens to my market share? The price will go up and the Russians, the Brazilians, US shale oil producers will take my share... We {{want to tell the}} world that high-efficiency producing countries are the ones that deserve market share. That is the operative principle in all capitalist countries...

500|$|The band toured {{nationally in}} July 2010 {{to support the}} album, while its lead single, the title track, had {{appeared}} in May and charted in the Top30 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The second single, [...] "Tommy and Krista", was released in September, which peaked at No.10 in New Zealand. Another single, [...] "All My Life", was featured in the promotional clips for the 2010 AFL grand final. Its music video was directed by Adrian Van de Velde and was shot in early October in Bangkok, Thailand. The narrative is a 'heroic love' set on a local military base and features Russian model-actress Maria Mazikova, together with 50 Thai army troops, an Iroquois helicopter, and a Chinook helicopter. In November Lip Magazines Shannon Andreucci reviewed a live gig, [...] " [...] are certainly no Pixies, Beatles or Sex Pistols. They're not breaking any rules or boundaries in the revolutionary world of rock music. In fact they are perfectly happy and capable of playing within the parameters of radio friendly and commercially safe pop rock. But one <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> sure; they {{go the extra mile}} in giving a charmingly refined and hearty live performance and that in itself should be commended".|$|E
500|$|It was {{not clear}} whether the Department of State or Lodge was {{enthusiastic}} about the political change in Saigon at the time, but if they were not, they were handed a fait accompli. A CIA report from Saigon soon after the seizure of power told the State Department that [...] "It {{is safe to say that}} Khánh's group will be essentially pro-American, anti-communist and anti-neutralist in general orientation." [...] As far as Harkins was concerned, with US policy committed to maintaining leadership in the hands of senior military officers, there were no other apparent options; he told General Taylor, [...] "One <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> sure with this coup. We've gone through all the eligible general officers." [...] For his part, Lodge chose not to warn the junta, to which the embassy had pledged their support, as to the imminent plot, despite being well aware of it. He said in a cable a few days after the coup that [...] "General Khánh's coup was extremely disconcerting at first blush", but that the lack of public reaction to the overthrow of Minh indicated that Khánh's actions were not something to be alarmed about. He wrote that the progress of history was often made in many phases by different individuals or groups, using the analogy that in an American political party, the people who manage the primary campaigns are different from those who run the national elections, while the officer-holders are entirely separate. Lodge speculated that while Minh and his generals were successful in removing Diệm—something Lodge strongly encouraged—they may not be the ideal administrators of a nation themselves. With respect to the prospects of defeating the communists, he said [...] "Our side knows how to do it; we have the means with which to do it; we simply need to do it. This requires a tough and ruthless commander. Perhaps Khánh is it." [...] Blair said that Lodge's habit of looking for American parallels to Vietnamese situations hindered his judgment, pointing out that Khánh's rule merely saw more instability and chaos. At the end of February, Lodge was still positive and cabled Washington to say that [...] "I continue to be favorably impressed by him. He is really very much more able than the Minh, Don, Kim group and, of course, he is so far above Diệm and Nhu that there is no comparison." ...|$|E

Ibrahimović ended Sweden's qualifying campaign with eight goals, including two in a play-off defeat to Portugal, as the team failed to reach the 2014 World Cup. Ibrahimović summarised the defeat by saying: [...] "One <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> sure, a World Cup without me is nothing to watch." ...|$|E
2500|$|Suggestions were made, despite initial {{skepticism}} on {{the part}} of the composer, that Boito would be interested in creating a new libretto based upon the play. Within several days, Ricordi approached Verdi with the request that he would like to visit Sant' Agata [...] "with a friend" [...] in September.

I feel that the most important <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> me to continue to work towards being 100 percent healthy. My main priority and responsibility is to the Columbus Blue Jackets and I don't believe participating in the Olympics, which is a short, intense tournament, would be the best thing to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Film {{director}} Edgar Wright {{and actor}} Simon Pegg are big fans of Assault. [...] "You wouldn't really {{call it an}} action film," [...] claims Pegg, [...] "because it was pre- the evolution {{of that kind of}} film. And yet it is kind of an action film in a way." [...] "It's very much his [...] kind of urban western", adds Wright, [...] "in the way it is staging Rio Bravo set up in downtown 70s LA... And the other <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>for</b> a low-budget film particularly, it looks great." [...] In October 2011, artist Tyler Stout premiered his mondo-style poster of Assault. Stout's poster would later serve as the cover on the Region B Blu-ray of Assault.|$|E

The Thing is well-paced, designed with an excellent variety of levels [...] Everything {{is consistent with the}} movie, the theme of which has been handled with exquisite care and thought. With the exception of the blood test goofs and the rather thin storyline, The Thing warrants your time and money." [...] Steve Polak scored the PC version 8.5 out of 10, writing [...] "The <b>Thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> the most part an immersive and enjoyable game. The visuals and sound are top notch and the sense of desperation you feel when you are stuck outside and about to succumb to the elements or being hunted by packs of the foul creatures is very real. The squad based elements and the way you keep your men from losing their minds also adds to the depth of the play experience." ...|$|E
