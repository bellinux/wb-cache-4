5|$|Since archaeoastronomers {{disagree}} {{so widely}} on {{the characterization of}} <b>the</b> <b>discipline,</b> they even dispute its name. All three major international scholarly associations relate archaeoastronomy {{to the study of}} culture, using the term Astronomy in Culture or a translation. Michael Hoskin sees an important part of <b>the</b> <b>discipline</b> as fact-collecting, rather than theorizing, and proposed to label this aspect of <b>the</b> <b>discipline</b> Archaeotopography. Ruggles and Saunders proposed Cultural Astronomy as a unifying term for the various methods of studying folk astronomies. Others have argued that astronomy is an inaccurate term, what are being studied are cosmologies and people who object to the use of logos have suggested adopting the Spanish cosmovisión.|$|E
