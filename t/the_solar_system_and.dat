5|$|The {{outer limit}} of the Oort cloud defines the cosmographical {{boundary}} of <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> <b>and</b> {{the extent of the}} Sun's Hill sphere. The outer Oort cloud is only loosely bound to <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> <b>and</b> thus is easily affected by the gravitational pull both of passing stars and of the Milky Way itself. These forces occasionally dislodge comets from their orbits within the cloud and send them toward the inner Solar System. Based on their orbits, most of the short-period comets may come from the scattered disc, but some may still have originated from the Oort cloud.|$|E

5|$|Earth's axis of {{rotation}} is tilted, producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface. The gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes the Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation.

5|$|Because Neptune {{is not a}} solid body, its {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The wide {{equatorial zone}} rotates with {{a period of about}} 18hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> <b>and</b> it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Asteroids {{represent}} the only in situ surviving population of planetesimals from {{the formation of}} <b>the</b> inner <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> therefore include materials from the very earliest stages of <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> formation. Hence, these bodies can provide constraints on the processes and conditions that were present during this epoch {{and can be used}} to test current models and theories describing <b>the</b> late <b>solar</b> nebula, <b>the</b> early <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> subsequent planetary accretion. From detailed knowledge of asteroid mineralogic compositions the probable starting materials, thermal histories, and oxidation states of asteroid parent bodies can be inferred. If such data can be obtained from specific mainbelt source regions, then this information can be used to map out the formation conditions of <b>the</b> late <b>solar</b> nebula within <b>the</b> inner <b>solar</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> possibly distinguish any trends in oxidation state that may be present...|$|R

5|$|Boron is a {{chemical}} element with symbolB and atomic number5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae {{and not by}} stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>system</b> <b>and</b> in the Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals.|$|E
5|$|Callisto (Jupiter IV) is {{the fourth}} and last Galilean moon, and is the second largest of the four, and at 4820.6 {{kilometers}} in diameter, it is the third largest moon in <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> <b>and</b> barely smaller than Mercury, though {{only a third of}} the latter's mass. It is named after the Greek mythological nymph Callisto, a lover of Zeus who was a daughter of the Arkadian King Lykaon and a hunting companion of the goddess Artemis. The moon does not form part of the orbital resonance that affects three inner Galilean satellites and thus does not experience appreciable tidal heating. Callisto is composed of approximately equal amounts of rock and ices, which makes it the least dense of the Galilean moons. It {{is one of the most}} heavily cratered satellites in <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> <b>and</b> one major feature is a basin around 3000km wide called Valhalla.|$|E
5|$|Pioneers 10 and 11 {{and both}} Voyager probes carry {{messages}} from the Earth to extraterrestrial life. Communication can be difficult with deep space travel.

5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{initially}} taken as postulates, but {{today there are}} efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the fine structure constant {{over much of the}} age of the universe is of order 10−5. Also, general relativity has passed stringent tests on the scale of <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> <b>and</b> binary stars.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} {{during the latter}} half of the 20th century of more objects within <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> <b>and</b> large objects around other stars, disputes arose over what should constitute a planet. There were particular disagreements over whether an object should be considered a planet if it was part of a distinct population such as a belt, or if it was large enough to generate energy by the thermonuclear fusion of deuterium.|$|E
5|$|Batygin and Brown {{suggested}} Planet Nine was a primordial giant planet core {{that was}} ejected from its initial orbit by {{an encounter with}} Jupiter during the nebular epoch of <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System</b> <b>and</b> was later perturbed into a stable orbit by a distant encounter with a passing star or by the solar nebula.

5|$|Haumea {{displays}} large {{fluctuations in}} brightness {{over a period}} of 3.9 hours, which can only be explained by a rotational period of this length. This is faster than any other known equilibrium body in <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> <b>and</b> indeed faster than any other known body larger than 100 km in diameter. While most rotating bodies in equilibrium are flattened into oblate spheroids, Haumea rotates so quickly that it is distorted into a triaxial ellipsoid. If Haumea were to rotate much more rapidly, it would distort itself into a dumbbell shape and split in two. This rapid rotation is thought to have been caused by the impact that created its satellites and collisional family.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} with the Discovery Channel, Mike Brown noted that, {{while it is not}} impossible that the Sun has a distant planetary companion, such an object would have to be lying very far from the observed regions of the Solar System to have no detectable gravitational effect on the other planets. A Mars-sized object could lie undetected at 300AU (10 times the distance of Neptune); a Jupiter-sized object at 30,000AU. To travel 1000AU in two years, an object would need to be moving at 2400km/s– faster than the galactic escape velocity. At that speed, any object would be shot out of <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> <b>and</b> then out of the Milky Way galaxy into intergalactic space.|$|E
5|$|Since all {{isotopes}} of neptunium have half-lives {{that are}} many times {{shorter than the}} age of the Earth, any primordial neptunium should have decayed by now. After only about 80 million years, the concentration of even the longest lived isotope, 237Np, would have been reduced to less than one-trillionth (10−12) of its original amount; and even if the whole Earth had initially been made of pure 237Np (and ignoring that this would be well over its critical mass of 60kg), 2100 half-lives would have passed since the formation of <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>System,</b> <b>and</b> thus all of it would have decayed. Thus neptunium is present in nature only in negligible amounts produced as intermediate decay products of other isotopes.|$|E
