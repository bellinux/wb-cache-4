Saccharo-myces carlsbergensis ferments all the sugar in raffinose broth and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, including the important variety ellipsoideus, ferments only one-third of this sugar.

The predicted polypeptide has 1431 residues (mol. wt 162, 000) and shows three characteristic domains; the large C-terminal region, {{which consists of}} alternating acidic-basic stretches and might be a chromatin-binding domain, the NH 2 half domain homologous to the ATP-binding gyrB subunit of bacterial gyrase and the central-to-latter part which is homologous to the NH 2 domain of the catalytic gyrA subunit, suggesting a possible evolutionary consequence of the gene fusion of the bacterial gyrase subunits into the eucaryotic DNA topoisomerase II gene.

40|$|The {{flocculation}} behaviour {{of a large}} set of top {{and bottom}} fermenting brewing yeasts was investigated. Bottom and top fermenting strains flocculated according to different mechanisms. Bottom strains flocculated in the stationary growth phase {{in the presence of}} sufficiently high Ca 2 + and sufficiently low sugar concentrations; these strains possessed a lectin-mediated flocculation mechanism. Top strains flocculated in the stationary growth phase without addition of Ca 2 +, only in the presence of sufficiently high concentrations of ethanol. Some of the top strains were inhibited with mannose, but not with sucrose or galactose, while others were not inhibited by any of these sugars. The different sensitivity of flocculation of top and bottom strains with respect to ethanol {{may be related to the}} hydrophobicity of the cell surface.

In addition, the filter paper storage demonstrated a faster absorption of free amino nitrogen and a highest level of higher aliphatic alcohols production during propagation than other preservation methods, which {{can be attributed to}} intensive cell growth during propagation. Moreover, the filter paper storage showed a faster accumulation for glycogen and trehalose during propagation, whereas, in particular, lyophilization storage noted a longer adaptation time regarding synthesis of glycogen and trehalose with delayed cell growth. In beer analysis, the filter paper storage formed an increased higher aliphatic alcohols than control. In conclusion, the preservation of filter paper affected positively on yeast growth, viability and beer quality independent on propagation temperature.

40|$|Eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I catalyzes the {{relaxation}} of positively and negatively supercoiled DNA and plays {{a critical role}} in processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication, transcription and recombination. The enzyme is encoded by the TOP 1 gene and is highly conserved in its amino acid sequence and sensitivity to the anti-neoplatic agent camptothecin. This plant alkaloid specifically targets DNA topoisomerase I by reversibly stabilizing the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate. Presumably, it is the interaction of these drug-stabilized adducts with other cellular components, such as replication forks, that actually produces the DNA lesions leading to cell death. A conservation of the mechanism(s) of camptothecin-induced cell killing is also implicit in studies of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the camptothecin sensitivity of delta <b>TOP</b> 1 <b>yeast</b> cells can be restored by plasmids expressing either <b>yeast</b> or human <b>TOP</b> 1 sequences. This genetically tractable system is currently being exploited to describe the specific molecular interactions required for the cytotoxic action of camptothecin.

This functional complementation allowed functional analysis of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of mammalian topoisomerase II, where the amino acid sequences are divergent and species-specific, {{in contrast to the}} highly conserved N-terminal and central domains. Several C-terminal deletion mutants of mouse topoisomerase IIalpha were constructed and expressed in <b>yeast</b> <b>top</b> 2 cells. We found that the CTD of topoisomerase IIalphais dispensable for enzymatic activity in vitro but is required for nuclear localization in vivo. Interestingly, the CTD of topoisomerase IIbetawas also able to function as a signal for nuclear targeting. We therefore examined whether the CTD alone is sufficient for nuclear localization in vivo. The C-terminal region was fused to GFP (green fluorescent protein) and expressed under the GAL 1 promoter in yeast cells. As expected, GFP signal was exclusively detected in the nucleus, irrespective of the CTD derived from either topoisomerase IIalphaor IIbeta. Surprisingly, when the upstream sequence of each CTD was added nuclear localization of the GFP signal was found to be cell cycle dependent: topoisomerase IIalpha-GFP was seen in the mitotic nucleus but was absent from the interphase nucleus, while topoisomerase IIbeta-GFP was detected predominantly in the interphase nucleus and less in the mitotic nucleus. Our results suggest that the catalytically dispensable CTD of topoisomerase II is sufficient as a signal for nuclear localization and that yeast cells can distinguish between the two isoforms of mammalian topoisomerase II, localizing each protein properly...|$|R

40|$|Abstract <b>Top</b> Background <b>Yeast</b> (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) prions are {{efficiently}} propagated and the on-going {{generation and}} transmission of prion seeds (propagons) to daughter cells during cell division ensures {{a high degree}} of mitotic stability. The reversible inhibition of the molecular chaperone Hsp 104 p by guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) results in cell division-dependent elimination of yeast prions due to a block in propagon generation and the subsequent dilution out of propagons by cell division. Principal Findings Analysing the kinetics of the GdnHCl-induced elimination of the yeast [PSI+] prion has allowed us to develop novel statistical models that aid our understanding of prion propagation in yeast cells. Here we describe the application of a new stochastic model that allows us to estimate more accurately the mean number of propagons in a [PSI+] cell. To achieve this accuracy we also experimentally determine key cell reproduction parameters and show that the presence of the [PSI+] prion has no impact on these key processes. Additionally, we experimentally determine the proportion of propagons transmitted to a daughter cell and show this reflects the relative cell volume of mother and daughter cells at cell division. Conclusions While propagon generation is an ATP-driven process, the partition of propagons to daughter cells occurs by passive transfer via the distribution of cytoplasm. Furthermore, our new estimates of n 0, the number of propagons per cell (500 – 1000), are some five times higher than our previous estimates and this has important implications for our understanding of the inheritance of the [PSI+] and the spontaneous formation of prion-free cells. ...|$|R

Even though several aspects of drug activity against Top 2 are understood, the drug receptor site is not yet known.

Here, we have investigated the sensitivity to three closely related anthracycline derivatives of <b>yeast</b> <b>Top</b> 2 bearing mutations in the CAP-like domain and integrated the findings with computer models of ternary drug-enzyme-DNA complexes.

The drug molecule is intercalated into DNA at the site of cleavage, and interestingly, drug-enzyme contacts involve one side of the four-ring chromophore and the side chain of the anthracycline molecule. The findings may explain several established structure-activity relationships of antitumor anthracyclines and may thus provide a framework for further developments of effective Top 2 poisons...|$|R

In order to generate and select temperature-sensitive mouse topo Ha, an expression plasmid was mutagenized in vitro and was transformed, using the plasmid shuffling method, into the yeast strain, in which the endogenous TOP 2 gene had been disrupted.

We studied meiosis in a heat-sensitive top 2 mutant of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Topoisomerase II is not required until shortly before meiosis I. The enzyme is necessary for condensation shortly before the first meiotic division but not for early meiotic prophase condensation. DNA replication, prophase morphology, and dynamics of the linear elements are normal in the top 2 mutant. The top 2 cells are not able to perform meiosis I. Arrested cells have four spindle pole bodies and two spindles but only one nucleus, suggesting that the arrest is nonregulatory. Finally, we show that the arrest is partly solved in a top 2 rec 7 double mutant, indicating that topoisomerase II functions in the segregation of recombined chromosomes. We suggest that the inability to decatenate the replicated DNA is the primary defect in top 2.

Given the distinct enzymatic activities of Sir 2 and Top 1 proteins, a histone deacetylase and a DNA topoisomerase, respectively, we investigated whether genetic and/or physical {{interactions between the}} two proteins could explain the shared ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) phenotypes. We employed an approach of complementing top 1 Δ cells with yeast, human, truncated, and chimeric yeast/human TOP 1 constructs and of assessing the extent of non-coding RNA silencing and histone H 4 K 16 deacetylation. Our findings demonstrate that residues 115 – 125 within the <b>yeast</b> <b>Top</b> 1 p N-terminal domain are required for the complementation of the top 1 Δ rDNA phenotypes. In chromatin immunoprecipitation and co-immunoprecipitation experiments, we further demonstrate the physical interaction between Top 1 p and Sir 2 p.

40|$|The fission <b>yeast</b> <b>top</b> 2 locus {{is defined}} by five temperature-sensitive {{mutations}} that cause heat-labile activity of type II DNA topoisomerase in the cell extracts. We show that the top 2 locus is a structural gene for type II toposiomerase by cloning a genomic DNA fragment that complements top 2. The top 2 mutants at restrictive temperature produce abnormal chromosomes {{at the time of}} mitotis; these are transiently extended into filamentous structures along with the elongating mitotic spindle but are not separated. A primary defect in top 2 appears to be the formation of aberrant mitotic chromosomes inseparable by the force generated by the spindle apparatus. Consistently, the top 2 cells that become lethal during mitotis contain a catenated dimer of an ARS plasmid. DNA and RNA continue to be synthesized if cytokinesis is blocked. Uncoordinated mitosis, that is the occurrence of spindle dynamics without chromosome separation, is revealed in top 2, and is discussed in relation to mitotic regulation. Different phenotypes between top 2 and top 1 –top 2 described in the present paper can be explained by a previously proposed hypothesis that type II topoisomerase has dual in vivo functions: one that decatenates and unknots duplex DNAs is essential in mitotis, whereas the other which relaxes supercoils is required throughout the cell cycle if type I topoisomerase is absent...|$|R

Genetic analysis of <b>yeast</b> <b>TOP</b> 3 and SGS 1 has lent considerable evidence {{to the notion that}} the protein products of these genes are involved in just such a process, although biochemical analysis of the metabolism of a dHJ has been hindered by the lack of a substrate that adequately replicates the endogenous structure. We have synthesized a dHJ substrate that recapitulates many of the features of an endogenous dHJ and represents a much earlier intermediate in the resolution pathway. Here, we show that Drosophila topoisomerase IIIα (Topo IIIα) and Blm (a homolog of Sgs 1) are capable of resolving this substrate to non-cross-over products and that this activity is stimulated by replication protein A (RPA). We investigated the ability of other Drosophila topoisomerases to perform this reaction in concert with Blm and RPA and discovered that this resolution activity is unique to Topo IIIα. Examination of the mechanism of resolution reveals that Topo IIIα, Blm, and RPA resolve this substrate by convergent migration of the two HJs toward each other, collapsing the dHJ. This mechanism stands in contrast to classic resolvase activities that use a structure-specific endonuclease to cleave the HJs...|$|R

To determine whether these phenotypes were faithfully reiterated in higher eukaryotic cells, wild-type and mutant <b>yeast</b> <b>Top</b> 1 proteins were epitope-tagged at the amino terminus and transiently overexpressed in mammalian COS cells. Camptothecin preferentially induced apoptosis in cells expressing wild-type eScTop 1 p yet did not appreciably increase the cytotoxic response of cells expressing a catalytically inactive (eSctop 1 Y 727 F) or a catalytically active, camptothecin-resistant eSctop 1 vac mutant. Using an epitope-specific antibody, immobilized precipitates of eScTop 1 p were active in DNA relaxation assays, whereas immunoprecipitates of eScTop 1 Y 727 Fp were not. Thus, the enzyme retained catalytic activity while tethered to a support. Interestingly, the mutant eSctop 1 T 722 A, which mimics camptothecin-induced cytotoxicity in yeast through stabilization of the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate, induced apoptosis in COS cells {{in the absence of}} camptothecin. This correlated with increased DNA cleavage in immunoprecipitates of eScTop 1 T 722 Ap, {{in the absence of the}} drug.

It is believed that the majority of VSG switching events occur by duplicative gene conversion, but only a few DNA repair genes that are central to HR have been assigned a role in this process. Gene conversion events that are associated with crossover are rarely seen in VSG switching, similar to mitotic HR. In other organisms, TOPO 3 a (<b>Top</b> 3 in <b>yeasts),</b> a type IA topoisomerase, is part of a complex that is involved in the suppression of crossovers. We therefore asked whether a related mechanism might suppress VSG recombination. Using a set of reliable recombination and switching assays that could score individual switching mechanisms, we discovered that TOPO 3 a function is conserved in Trypanosoma brucei and that TOPO 3 a plays a critical role in antigenic switching. Switching frequency increased 10 – 40 -fold in the absence of TOPO 3 a and this hyper-switching phenotype required RAD 51. Moreover, the preference of 70 -bp repeats for VSG recombination was mitigated, while homology regions elsewhere in ES were highly favored, in the absence of TOPO 3 a.

Because these traits can be reverted by the extrachromosomal expression of either eukaryotic topoisomerase I or II, their origin is attributed to the persistence of unconstrained DNA supercoiling. Here, we examine whether the expression of the Escherichia coli topA gene, which encodes the bacterial topoisomerase I that removes only negative supercoils, compensates the phenotype of Delta top 1 <b>top</b> 2 (ts) <b>yeast</b> cells. We found that Delta top 1 top 2 (ts) mutants expressing E. coli topoisomerase I grow faster and do not manifest rDNA excision and minichromosome multimerization. Furthermore, the recombination frequency in repeated DNA sequences, which is increased by nearly two orders of magnitude in Delta top 1 top 2 (ts) mutants relative to the parental TOP+ cells, is restored to normal levels when the bacterial topoisomerase is expressed. These results indicate that the suppression of mitotic hyper-recombination caused by eukaryotic topoisomerases I and II is effected mainly by the relaxation of negative rather than positive supercoils; they also highlight the potential of unconstrained negative supercoiling to promote homologous recombination...|$|R

This idea was tested by confirming that sgs 1 and rmi 1 mutants display the same spectrum of synthetic lethal interactions, including the requirements for SLX 1, SLX 4, SLX 5, and SLX 8, and by demonstrating that rmi 1 mus 81 synthetic lethality is dependent on homologous recombination. On their own, mutations in RMI 1 result in phenotypes that mimic those of sgs 1 or top 3 strains including slow growth, hyperrecombination, DNA damage sensitivity, and reduced sporulation. And like top 3 strains, most rmi 1 phenotypes are suppressed by mutations in SGS 1. We show that Rmi 1 forms a heteromeric complex with Sgs 1 -Top 3 in yeast and that these proteins interact directly in a recombinant system. The Rmi 1 -Top 3 complex is stable {{in the absence of the}} Sgs 1 helicase, but the loss of either Rmi 1 or <b>Top</b> 3 in <b>yeast</b> compromises its partner's interaction with Sgs 1. Biochemical studies demonstrate that recombinant Rmi 1 is a structure-specific DNA binding protein with a preference for cruciform structures. We propose that the DNA binding specificity of Rmi 1 plays a role in targeting Sgs 1 -Top 3 to appropriate substrates...|$|R
40|$|Topoisomerase II (Top 2) is {{the primary}} target for active {{anti-cancer}} agents. We developed an efficient approach for identifying hypersensitive Top 2 mutants and isolated a panel of mutants in <b>yeast</b> <b>Top</b> 2 conferring hypersensitivity to the intercalator N-[4 -(9 -acridinylamino) - 3 -methoxyphenyl]methanesulphonanilide (mAMSA). Some mutants conferred hypersensitivity to etoposide as well as mAMSA, whereas other mutants exhibited hypersensitivity only to mAMSA. Two mutants in Top 2, changing Pro 473 to Leu and Gly 737 to Val, conferred extraordinary hypersensitivity to mAMSA and were chosen for further characterization. The mutant proteins were purified, and their biochemical activities were assessed. Both mutants encode enzymes that are hypersensitive to inhibition by mAMSA and other intercalating agents and exhibited elevated levels of mAMSA-induced Top 2 :DNA covalent complexes. While Gly 737 → Val Top 2 p generated elevated levels of Top 2 -mediated double strand breaks in vitro, the Pro 473 → Leu mutant protein showed only a modest increase in Top 2 -mediated double strand breaks but much higher levels of Top 2 -mediated single strand breaks. In addition, the Pro 473 → Leu mutant protein also generated high levels of mAMSA-stabilized covalent complexes {{in the absence of}} ATP. We tested the role of single strand cleavage in cell killing with alleles of Top 2 that could generate single strand breaks, but not double strand breaks. Expression in yeast of a Pro 473 → Leu mutant that could only generate single strand breaks conferred hypersensitivity to mAMSA. These results indicate that generation of single strand breaks by Top 2 -targeting agents can be an important component of cell killing by Top 2 -targeting drugs...|$|R
40|$|ICRF- 193, a novel noncleavable, complex-stabilizing type topoisomerase (topo) II inhibitor, {{has been}} shown to target topo II in {{mammalian}} cells (Ishida, R., T. Miki, T. Narita, R. Yui, S. Sato, K. R. Utsumi, K. Tanabe, and T. Andoh. 1991. Cancer Res. 51 : 4909 - 4916). With the aim of elucidating the roles of topo II in mammalian cells, we examined the effects of ICRF- 193 on the transition through the S phase, when the genome is replicated, and through the M phase, when the replicated genome is condensed and segregated. Replication of the genome {{did not appear to be}} affected by the drug because the scheduled synthesis of DNA and activation of cdc 2 kinase followed by increase in mitotic index occurred normally, while VP- 16, a cleavable, complex-stabilizing type topo II inhibitor, inhibited all these processes. In the M phase, however, late stages of chromosome condensation and segregation were clearly blocked by ICRF- 193. Inhibition at the stage of compaction of 300 -nm diameter chromatin fibers to 600 -nm diameter chromatids was demonstrated using the drug during premature chromosome condensation (PCC) induced in tsBN 2 baby hamster kidney cells in early S and G 2 phases. In spite of interference with M phase chromosome dynamics, other mitotic events such as activation of cdc 2 kinase, spindle apparatus reorganization and disassembly and reassembly of nuclear envelopes occurred, and the cells traversed an unusual M phase termed "absence of chromosome segregation" (ACS) -M phase. Cells then continued through further cell cycle rounds, becoming polyploid and losing viability. This effect of ICRF- 193 on the cell cycle was shown to parallel that of inactivation of topo II on the cell cycle of the ts <b>top</b> 2 mutant <b>yeast.</b> The results strongly suggest that the essential roles of topo II are confined to the M phase, when the enzyme decatenates intertwined replicated chromosomes. In other phases of the cycle, including the S phase, topo II may thus play a complementary role with topo I in controlling the torsional strain accumulated in various genetic processes...|$|R
40|$|DNA repair {{pathways}} {{have evolved}} to protect the genome from damage caused by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Although numerous DNA repair mechanisms have been studied and reported, information regarding how they coordinate with the necessary changes in chromatin structure is scarce. Smc (structural maintenance of chromosomes) proteins are a conserved, essential family of proteins required for chromosome organization and accurate segregation. The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has three Smc-protein complexes: Smc 1 / 3 complex (cohesin), Smc 2 / 4 complex (condensin) and the Smc 5 / 6 complex, required for sister chromatid cohesion, condensation and DNA repair, respectively. The chromatin associated Smc 5 / 6 complex consists of Smc 5, Smc 6 and six non-smc elements (Nse 1 -Nse 6). Smc 5 and Smc 6 are required for stability of repetitive chromosomal regions and sister chromatid recombination-mediated repair of double-strand breaks. Mms 21 /Nse 2, a subunit of the Smc 5 / 6 complex, is a SUMO E 3 -ligase, which conjugates SUMO (small ubiquitin-like modifier) to Smc 5 and Yku 70 (DNA repair protein) and its SUMO ligase activity protects the cells from extrinsic DNA damage. To address the role of Nse 2 SUMO ligase in cellular events, we isolated mutants (nse 2 ∆sl and nse 2 C 221 A) defective in the E 3 -ligase domain of Nse 2 and found that these mutants are sensitive to genotoxic agents, for example MMS, UV or bleomycin, as expected. We found that cysteine 221 present in the SP-RING domain of Nse 2 is required in the function of Nse 2 in resisting genotoxic stress. We found that nse 2 ∆sl cultures are slow growing and show increased abundance of cells having 2 N DNA content (indicative of a G 2 -M cell cycle delay or arrest) relative to wild type cells. The DNA damage checkpoint pathway is activated to a limited extent in unchallenged nse 2 ∆sl mutant cells indicating that cells lacking the SUMO ligase activity of Nse 2 incur spontaneous DNA damage. Furthermore nse 2 ∆sl cells are exquisitely sensitive to caffeine, an agent known to override the DNA damage checkpoint {{in a number of}} organisms by inhibiting the DNA damage checkpoint transducer ATR (Homo sapiens), Mec 1 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Rad 3 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe). In order to investigate the importance of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway for nse 2 ∆sl cells, we employed a genetic approach. We found that nse 2 ∆sl exhibits synthetic sick interaction with mec 1 ∆ but not tel 1 ∆ (defective in Mec 1 or Tel 1 PI kinases) or mrc 1 ∆ (defective in Mrc 1 or mediator of replication checkpoint 1) indicating that the DNA damage induced Mec 1 dependent checkpoint pathway is selectively required but the replication stress checkpoint pathway is dispensable for optimal growth of unchallenged nse 2 ∆sl cells. In order to further investigate the role of Nse 2 in S phase events, we used camptothecin (CPT), a drug that induces S phase specific double strand breaks. CPT inhibits topoisomerase I by trapping the covalent Top 1 -DNA intermediate. Collision of a DNA replication fork with such a complex results in double-strand and single-strand breaks in DNA. We found that nse 2 ∆sl is CPT-sensitive and that nse 2 ∆sl top 1 - 8 has a synthetic sick phenotype. Thus, our chemical and genetic interaction studies suggest that the SUMO ligase activity of Nse 2 may be required when Top 1 function is compromised. Interestingly, human and <b>yeast</b> <b>Top</b> 1 proteins are known to be sumoylated. Our findings suggest that MMS-induced enhancement of Top 1 sumoylation in budding yeast is partially dependent on SUMO ligase activity of Nse 2. Since both sumoylation and Top 1 play a role in telomere maintenance, we also examined the telomere length in single as well as double mutants and found that there is slight telomere lengthening in nse 2 ∆sl top 1 - 8 double mutant. To gain further insight into the genetic interaction between Nse 2 and other proteins which affect DNA topology, we also investigated genetic interaction of Nse 2 with other topoisomerases. We found that top 3 - 2 nse 2 ∆sl exhibited a synthetic sick phenotype but nse 2 ∆sl top 2 - 4 showed partial rescue of temperature sensitivity. In order to investigate whether chromosome integrity is compromised in nse 2 ∆sl cells we employed a YAC (yeast artificial chromosome) based assay to examine GCRs (gross chromosomal rearrangements). We found elevated levels of GCR in nse 2 ∆sl cells compared to wild type cells. Furthermore, deletion of DNA Topoisomerase 1 in nse 2 ∆sl background selectively destabilizes a longer YAC relative to shorter YACs. We also examined the effect of varying origin number on YAC stability in nse 2 ∆sl as well as top 1 ∆ and nse 2 ∆sl top 1 ∆ cells. We found that a YAC having fewer origins is not destabilized in nse 2 ∆sl and top 1 ∆ single mutants but is destabilized in the nse 2 ∆sl top 1 ∆ double mutant. Since Nse 2 is a non-SMC member of the Smc 5 / 6 complex, we also investigated the effect of varying origin number on YAC stability in smc 6 - 56 and smc 656 top 1 ∆ mutants. We found that the stability of a YAC is modestly compromised in the smc 6 - 56 mutant but its derivative having fewer origins is not further destabilized, rather it seems to be stabilized. In order to gain molecular insights into the involvement of the SUMO ligase activity of Nse 2 in maintenance of chromosome integrity, we examined sumoylation of specific substrates following a candidate approach. Smc 5 and Yku 70 are known targets of Nse 2 dependent sumoylation. We found that Smc 6 is also sumoylated and that the MMS-induced enhancement of Smc 6 sumoylation in budding yeast is partially dependent on Nse 2. To understand the functional significance of Smc 5 sumoylation, we mutated lysine residues of all the four predicted sumoylation sites ψKXE/D, individually as well as all four together. We found that all the single as well as quadruple mutants were weakly sensitive to MMS suggesting that these putative sumoylation sites of Smc 5 may contribute towards countering MMS-induced DNA damage. Interestingly, we found that Smc 5 sumoylation is enhanced when treated with MMS (methyl methane sulfonate) but not significantly with HU (hydroxyurea) and CPT (camptothecin). We also generated putative ATP-binding defective mutants in Smc 5. Previous studies suggest that the ATPase motif is required for the essential function of some Smc proteins (for example, Smc 1 and Smc 6). We found that smc 5 K 75 E and smc 5 K 75 Q, having a mutation in the lysine residue of the conserved GXGKS motif present in the Walker A type box at the Nterminus exhibited a null phenotype implying that this conserved lysine residue is required for essential function of Smc 5. In this study, employing genetic and biochemical methods, we have characterized the Nse 2 SUMO ligase defective mutant and analyzed its role in the unperturbed mitotic cell cycle and in genome maintenance. We have also employed genetic methods to study the involvement of both Nse 2 and DNA Topoisomerase I in maintaining genomic stability. Lastly, we have addressed the functional significance of Lysine residues of putative sumoylation sites and the conserved ATP-binding motif of Smc 5 by mutational analysis. In conclusion, our study highlights an important role for the SUMO ligase activity of Nse 2 in maintaining genomic stability and suggests that sumoylation of Smc 5 may be important for resisting MMS-induced genotoxic stress...|$|R
