5|$|Bowie and {{his brother}} John were {{involved}} in a major court case in the late 1820s over land speculation. When the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory in 1803, it promised to honor all former land grant claims, and for the next 20years efforts were made to establish who owned what land. In May 1824, Congress authorized <b>the</b> <b>superior</b> courts of each territory to hear suits from those who claimed they had been overlooked. The Arkansas Superior Court received 126claims in late 1827 from residents who claimed to have purchased land in former Spanish grants from the Bowie brothers. Although <b>the</b> <b>Superior</b> Court originally confirmed most of those claims, the decisions were reversed in February 1831 after further research showed that the land had never belonged to the Bowies and that the original land grant documentation had been forged. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the reversal in 1833. When the disgruntled purchasers considered suing the Bowies, they discovered that the documents in the case had been removed from the court; left without evidence, they declined to pursue a case.|$|E
