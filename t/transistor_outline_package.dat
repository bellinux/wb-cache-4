At an injection current of 20 mA and peak wavelength of 460 nm for TO (<b>transistor</b> <b>outline)</b> can <b>package,</b> the light output powers of conventional LED, LED with PQC on p-GaN surface, LED with PQC on n-side roughing, and LED with PQC structure on p-GaN surface and n-side roughing on TO can are given by 11.6, 13.5, 15.1, and 16.5 mW, respectively. Hence, the enhancement percentages of LED with PQC on p-GaN surface, LED with PQC on n-side roughing, and LED with PQC structure on p-GaN surface and n-side roughing were 16 %, 30 %, and 42 %, respectively, {{compared to that of}} the conventional LED. The higher enhancement of LED with both PQC structures was scattering and guiding light from LED top surface and n-side roughing onto the LED top direction [14, 21, 24] to increase more light output power. In addition, the corresponding wall-plug efficiencies (WPE) of conventional LED, LED with PQC on p-GaN surface, LED with PQC on n-side roughing, and LED with PQC structure on p-GaN surface and n-side roughing were 19 %, 22 %, 24 %, and 26 %, respectively, which addresses a substantial improvement by the PQC structures on top surface and n-side roughing as well at a driving current of 20 mA. Comparing with the conventional LED, the WPEs of LED with PQC on p-GaN surface, LED with PQC on n-side roughing, and LED with PQC structure on p-GaN surface and n-side roughing were increased by 15.8 %, 26.3 %, and 36.8 %, respectively, at an injection current of 20 mA, The enhancement of WPE of LED with PQC structure on p-GaN surface and n-side roughing is relatively high comparing with other researches [10, 13, 14, 24, 25], which is because the light emitted from LED scattered by top PQC pattern and guided onto the LED top direction by n-side roughing [22, 23, 26], therefore resulting in the enhancement of WPE.|$|R

40|$|Wire bonding failures, {{including}} non-stick on die pad (bond-off) and smash ball of {{the first}} bond, are often encountered in manufacturing of miniaturized packages with increased feature density and higher UPH requirement. Many researches have been conducted with an attempt to solve these issues. However, these studies mainly focused on the correlations between bonding pad qualities and robust ball bonding solutions. Few of them investigated these failures from a mechanical point of view, such as deflection of leadframe under vertical bonding force. For today's small <b>outline</b> <b>transistor</b> (SOT) <b>packages,</b> the leadframe has low profiles and complex structures, which makes the wire bonding response very complex and difficult to be predicted. This paper demonstrated that the deflection of leadframe at the first bond position {{played an important role}} on the bond-off failure for SOT packages. When the deflection was larger than 5 μm at critical bonding locations, severe bond-off failure occurred. By applying finite element analysis, some ways to reduce this deflection thus eliminating the risk of bond-off failure were discussed and verified by experiments, which include leadframe structure modification at some local areas, change of supporting tape types, and lowering of bonding temperature. This work provides several guidelines for leadframe designers to achieve an optimized leadframe design of miniaturized packages, for the sake of improving wire bonding performances. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

Due to the complicated structure design of the package and mold cavity, wire sweep is becoming an increasingly severe problem. In this study, the numerical model which had been validated by experimental work was used for wire sweep analysis. Firstly, the leadframe structure was studied. Given the thin thickness of leadframe and the relative position to the bond wire loop, the leadframe structure has very limited influence on the wire sweep value. Besides, for fixed width and length of the die, the wire sweep behavior was simulated to examine the influence of the die height (thickness). The results show that the thinner the die, the smaller the wire sweep. Furthermore, the effect of cavity height on wire sweep value was also estimated. Based on the previous simulation and analyses, the ratio of the die height to that of the cavity was introduced as an index to optimize the flow pattern of epoxy molding compound (EMC) in order to find a guideline for package and cavity design to avoid the wire sweep issue. In addition, the influence of injection velocity and viscosity of EMC on wire sweep during transfer molding process were inspected and discussed according to the simulation results as well. It can be further concluded that the velocity plays the key role in resulting in the severe wire sweep in package array mold during transfer molding process. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Small <b>outline</b> <b>transistor</b> (SOT) <b>packages,</b> {{because of}} their low cost and low profile, are widely used in {{consumer}} electronics. Ni/Fe alloy (A 42) is {{the most widely used}} leadframe material of SOT packages because of its good formability and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) match with silicon die. The very small size of SOT packages allow a higher package density on a board, but the small size and close proximity of SOT packages make thermal management difficult. The low thermal conductivity of A 42, which is less than one tenth of that of copper, makes the thermal conduction even more difficult. Thus, the method of copper plating on A 42 leadframe is used to enhance the thermal conductivity of SOT packages while keeping their low cost and good CTE match between leadframe and silicon die. In this paper, the junction temperature T-j, the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance theta(j-a) and the junction-to-solder joint thermal resistance theta(j-sp) are used to evaluate the heat dissipating ability of the package. The finite element method is applied to study the influence of copper plating thickness on the thermal performance of a SOT package. A thermal resistance circuit model and the corresponding thermal resistance expression on function of the copper plating thickness are then proposed to quantify the influence of copper plating thickness. The proposed expression, which follows a hyperbolic form, can well predict thermal resistance of the model. Finally, die cracking issue of the SOT packages with copper leadframe is examined and the residual stress on silicon die after die bonding process is studied. By comparing the cracking pattern and the stress state, shear fracture is proposed to be the crack initiation mechanism. Results also show that copper plating on A 42 leadframe has little influence on the distribution of the thermal residual stress in the die. The stress level for the SOT package with copper plated A 42 leadframe is much lower than that with copper leadframe, which makes the die cracking risk much lower...|$|R

In the study, the numerical model was firstly validated by experimental work using short shots experiment and X-ray technology. Then the verified model was employed for flow pattern and wire sweep analysis. The leadframe detail structure effects were evaluated at first. The effects of leadframe detail structure on flow pattern and wire sweep are insignificant and may be ignored, most likely due to the thin thickness of leadframe and the relatively lower position to the bond wire loop. Besides, for fixed width and length of the die, the wire sweep behavior was predicted by simulation to estimate the influence of the die height (thickness). The results show that the thinner the die, the smaller the wire sweep. Furthermore, the effect of cavity height on wire sweep value was also evaluated. Then, the ratio of the die height to that of the cavity was introduced as an index to investigate the main factors which influence the wire sweep values and propose a guideline for package and cavity design to reduce the wire sweep. It can be further concluded that velocity is more sensitive to the change of the package and cavity structures, compared with the viscosity. Next, a new design of industry package array mold was introduced for wire sweep study with the practical transfer molding process conditions. It shows the sharply increased velocity is the essential reason for the wire sweep issue at the vent side of the mold, due to the unbalanced flow of EMC. In order to address the issue, the transfer mold process optimization with transfer profile was carried out. The simulation results reveal the transfer molding process optimization is an effective and convenient {{way to deal with the}} wire sweep problem. Furthermore, the flow pattern optimization was carried out to fulfill the balance flow of EMC by changing the mold design to lower wire sweep risk...|$|R
