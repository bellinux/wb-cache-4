5|$|Final Fantasy XI has {{a largely}} player-based economy, {{with a heavy}} {{reliance}} on auction houses in each of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>cities</b> of Vana'diel. There are certain economic controls in place mainly {{in the form of}} fees for putting items up for auction. Transportation, auction house, item storage, and fees do not go to players; these gil sinks effectively remove money from the economy to prevent inflation. The city of Jeuno used to levy a tax on bazaar purchases inside the city, but it was removed in a patch in the December 2008 version update.|$|E
5|$|It is {{very rare}} for snow to fall in the U.S. state of Florida, {{especially}} in the central and southern portions of the state.

In the Florida Keys and Key West there is no known occurrence of snow flurries since the settlement of the region.|$|E

5|$|Population and {{commercial}} activity grew rapidly after India gained independence in August 1947. The only link across the Hooghly River, the Howrah Bridge, between Howrah and Kolkata, {{was subject to}} much traffic congestion, with over 85,000 vehicles every day. This necessitated planning for a new bridge across the river {{so that it could}} connect to <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>cities</b> of Mumbai (Bombay), Delhi and Chennai (Madras) through the national highways located close to the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Russian successes {{followed}} {{similar patterns}} featuring {{a multitude of}} small campaigns, with sieges where musketmen {{played a key role}} in destroying wooden defences with effective artillery support. The Tsar's forces took important fortresses like Fellin (Viljandi), yet lacked the means to gain <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>cities</b> of Riga, Reval or Pernau. The Livonian knights suffered a disastrous defeat by the Russians at the Battle of Ērģeme in August 1560. Some historians believe the Russian nobility were split over the timing of the invasion of Livonia.|$|E
5|$|Seattle {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>cities</b> that {{benefited from}} {{programs}} such as the WPA, CCC, UCL, and PWA.

However, Seattle faced massive unemployment, loss of lumber and construction industries as Los Angeles prevailed as the bigger West Coast city. Seattle had building contracts that rivaled New York City and Chicago, but lost to LA as well. Seattle’s eastern farm land faded due to Oregon’s and the Midwest’s, forcing people into town.|$|E

5|$|Smaller {{works were}} not usually {{produced}} on commission. More often the masters anticipated the formats and images {{that would be}} most sought after and their designs were then developed by workshop members. Ready made paintings were sold at regularly held fairs, or the buyers could visit workshops, which tended to be clustered in certain areas of <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>cities.</b> The masters were allowed to display in their front windows. This was the typical mode {{for the thousands of}} panels produced for the middle class – city officials, clergy, guild members, doctors and merchants.|$|E
5|$|The Monkland Canal (completed 1791) {{was used}} in the 19th and 20th century to {{transport}} coal and iron to Glasgow. The town centre section of the canal was interred in pipe between Sikeside and Blair Road in the mid-1970s. Some sections of the Monkland Canal can still be seen today between Townhead and Drumpellier. Coatbridge is adjacent to the M8 and M73 motorways.

The 1990 Manjil–Rudbar earthquake, with at least 42,000 fatalities, cost Iran roughly 7.2 percent of its Gross National Product (GNP) for that year and wiped out two years of economic growth.|$|E

5|$|The {{quality of}} health care is {{generally}} low. In Cameroon, {{there is only one}} doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. Due to financial cuts in the health care system, there are few professionals. Doctors and nurses who were trained in Cameroon, emigrate because in Cameroon the payment is poor while the workload is high. Nurses are unemployed even though their help is needed. Some of them help out voluntarily so they will not lose their skills. Outside <b>the</b> <b>major</b> <b>cities,</b> facilities are often dirty and poorly equipped.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to defeat}} Agesilaus' army, Pharnabazus decided to force Agesilaus to {{withdraw}} by stirring up {{trouble on the}} Greek mainland.

Timocrates visited Athens, Thebes, Corinth, and Argos, and succeeded in persuading powerful factions {{in each of those}} states to pursue an anti-Spartan policy. The Thebans, who had previously demonstrated their antipathy towards Sparta, undertook to bring about a war.|$|E
5|$|When such an {{army was}} prepared, it was {{commanded}} by several generals. The Commander-in-Chief {{of the army}} was usually a member of nobility. The King and his generals led the army from the front during battles, mounted on elephants. <b>The</b> <b>major</b> <b>cities</b> of the kingdom were defended with defensive walls and moats. Sieges, often lasting several months, were common during warfare. Single combat between the opposing kings or commanders, mounted on elephants, often decided {{the outcome of the}} battle.|$|E
