40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} theories of interreligious dialogue and Muslim-Christian dialogue specifically. The aim is to examine whether Legenhausen’s non-reductive religious pluralism, rooted in Shi’a theology, is a successful {{solution to the problem}} of difference involved in Hick’s (reductive) hypothesis. Such a study is important because it investigates what types of theories of interreligious relations are “difference-respecting” in the sense that they are capable of recognizing the significance of religious and cultural differences as invaluable resources for interfaith dialogue. The research approach adopted is a critical analysis of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> literature, <b>undertaken</b> from a philosophical/phenomenological perspective. The findings are that Legenhausen’s position does not solve the problem of difference to a satisfying degree because a) it is based on inclusivist thinking and thus faces the charge of spiritual superiority and b) by excusing differences between Muslim and Christian beliefs by reference to the concept of qasir (incapability), it does not take otherness seriously, which makes it even more reductive than classical pluralisms. The main conclusion is that a truly egalitarian account of religions, sensitive to issues of difference, needs to bridge the gulf between objective observer perspectives (adopted by pluralists) and insider views on interfaith issues (promoted by religiously specific approaches like Legenhausen’s). As an alternative theory it is therefore recommended to combine the best of both approaches into a (religiously non-specific) model of witnessing, based on minimal ethical pluralism...|$|R
40|$|The latest {{addition}} to the nanocarbon family, graphene, has been proclaimed to be the material of the century. Its peculiar band structure, extraordinary thermal and electronic conductance and room temperature quantum Hall effect have all been used for various applications in diverse fields ranging from catalysis to electronics. The difficulty to synthesize graphene in bulk quantities was a limiting factor of it being utilized in several fields. Advent of chemical processes and self-assembly approaches for the synthesis of graphene analogues have opened-up new avenues for graphene based materials. The high surface area and rich abundance of functional groups present make chemically synthesized graphene (generally known as graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) orchemically converted graphene) an attracting candidate in biotechnology and environmental remediation. By functionalizing graphene with specific molecules, the properties of graphene can be tuned to suite applications such as sensing, drug delivery or cellular imaging.

40|$|BACKGROUND. Findings of {{isolated}} (disseminated or circulating) tumor cells (ITC) by immunocytochemistry and molecular pathology methods {{have led to}} varied interpretations and different applications of the TNM system. METHODS. An analysis of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> literature was <b>undertaken.</b> In addition, optional proposals for the classification of ITC, micrometastasis, and cytologic results in pleural and peritoneal washings are presented. RESULTS. Immunocytochemistry has a lower false-positive rate than nonmorphologic methods such as flow cytometry or the polymerase chain reaction; therefore the method(s) used always should be recorded. At the current time, the independent prognostic significance of ITC in regional lymph nodes and in the general circulation (blood, bone marrow, and other distant sites) is difficult to assess. To enable comparisons of treatment results and to avoid variation in staging, a finding of ITC {{should not be considered}} in the TNM and residual tumor (R) classifications, at least not at the current time. However, for future evaluation of their prognostic significance, the respective findings should be documented according to uniform criteria. CONCLUSIONS. ITC should be distinguished from micrometastasis. To investigate the independent prognostic significance of ITC and of positive lavage cytology, uniform data collection according to the proposed coding schema is recommended.

The bulk of non- oil export of Nigeria comes from agriculture and pre-processed products. Hence, non-oil export from perspective of efficiency-seeking indicates that non-oil export always aim at taking advantage of poor-efficient production condition and boost the productive edge of resources. There is a general believe that non-oil exports commodities {{has nothing to do}} with sectoral growth in Nigeria, this role is therefore the major focus of this study. Modern econometric analysis is used to validate if there is any relationship between non-oil export and sectoral performance, we also conducted unit root test to detect the risk of non stationarity of any of the variables involve in the model specified.

40|$|There is {{a rising}} {{tendency}} among countries to prioritise some sports over others and make higher investments {{of money and}} resources in their elite development (Green and Oakley, 2001). Such policies and strategies are adopted in the UK, too. Some sports are considered more likely to bring Olympic medals than others and therefore, they are targeted to receive higher funding. Those placed outside the selection {{are more likely to}} face challenges in practices to develop their winning potential. Following further research in this occurrence, authors have sought evidences for an inter-relation between funding and performance (Garrett, 2004; Green, 2005; De Bosscher, et. al 2006). In addition, some have explored other influential factors and have stressed on the importance of participation in sport, as {{the quality and quantity of}} the talent pool plays a vital role in elite athletes’ development (Sam, 2012; Girginov and Hills, 2008; Shibli, 2012). As a result of an in-depth research, an extensive academic knowledge on Elite Sports policies and sport development has been built, as well as on each of the concepts of funding, performance and participation. There are many studies focused on the case of the UK in particular (Houlihan, 2004; Green, 2006). However, fewer authors have studied these concepts in pairs (mainly funding and performance), and none have examined the relationship and impacts of all three (Grix and Phillpots, 2011; Vayens, et. al 2009; Martindale, et. al 2007). This research will aim to establish if such relationship exists between Olympic sports funding distribution, Olympic performance, and national participation numbers.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} selection criteria for prospective dentistry students at the University of Pretoria. A study of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> literature was <b>undertaken,</b> and experts at universities in South Africa and Britain were interviewed. Ajob analysis questionnaire was used to identify <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> job requirements that could serve as selection criteria. Potential selection criteria that were identified include physical potential (e. g. visual-spatial and mechanical ability), cognitive potential (e. g. above-average intellectual potential, aptitude in the mathematical, science and technical fields), personality (e. g. patience with routine activities and repetition) and interpersonal potential (e. g. communication and leadership skills). These criteria were used as the point of departure for designing a draft selection programme. • To whom correspondence should be addressed: Recent changes in South African society have compelled tertiary institutions to think innovatively about their functioning and objectives, and whether they still prepare learners adequately for radically different circumstances. Specific career and socio-economic needs (including the need to train more professionals from previously disadvantaged groups) necessitate the facilitation of revised selection processes and the channelling of students at institutions, such as the University of Pretoria. This study aimed to address this challenge by trying to ascertain the potential dentistry student's configuration of qualities in relation to the unique configuration of requirements for the dentistry profession (Department of Manpower, (994). The first consideration is that a prospective dentistry student should possess the particular configuration of characteristics required to achieve academic and career success (Van Mollendorf, (990) and eventually experience job satisfaction. Therefore, it is important that from an early stage in their studies, prospective dentistry students be channelled into their career on the basis of the configuration of characteristics that correlate positively with the demands that characterise the dentistr...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the applicability of}} the export-led growth (ELG) hypothesis using empirical evidence from Nigeria. The bulk of FDI inflow into the country goes to the oil sector of the economy. But FDI from the perspective of efficiency-seeking indicates that foreign capital always aims at taking advantage of cost-efficient production condition. There is the general belief that this motive is predominant in sectors where products are produced mainly for regional and global markets and competition is mostly based on price and not on quality differentiation. In Nigeria, the role of FDI in the non oil exports – growth nexus has hitherto been under-researched. This role therefore is the major focus of this study. A causality analysis of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> variables was <b>undertaken</b> in order to verify the relevance of the ELG hypothesis in the Nigerian economy. Empirical evidence from available data failed to support the export-led growth hypothesis in Nigeria. Besides, the dynamic interaction among FDI, non-oil exports, and growth of the Nigerian economy was also investigated using the concept of variance decomposition and impulse response analysis. The result of the variance decomposition supports an earlier result obtained from the causality analysis which revealed that, a unidirectional causality runs from FDI to non-oil exports. Responses of the three variables to one standard deviation innovations were on the average, found to be dormant {{in the early stages of}} the out-of-sample forecast period but all demonstrated more pronounced responses after about 7 years into the forecast period...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{posits that}} tacit knowledge, explicit knowledge and hubris influence {{the decision-making process}} of managers when deciding to enter an emerging market. The literature on emergent market strategy and the decision-making process is abundant but tends {{to focus on the}} extant explicit information available. However, the prevalence of literature on the influence of tacit knowledge or experience needs to be further developed. Given the focus on Africa as an area for economic development and the complexity that comes with doing business in Africa, this study seeks to explore what homage is given to tacit knowledge and experience by strategy makers during the process of strategy development, how this knowledge is harboured and developed. The study also seeks to explore the transferability of the knowledge between countries, and if this knowledge can become an inhibitor in developing strategy. A review of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> literature is <b>undertaken</b> and a model is developed to map out this decision-making process. A qualitative tool is developed and eight interviews with managers responsible for emergent market strategy development are held to obtain an understanding of how tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge feature on the decision-making process. Key learnings from the study includes a disparity between literature on the importance of tacit knowledge and the growing tendency to formalise the country entry process; the prevalence of heuristics and hubris in the decision-making process, and absence of a review process to validate strategies and decision making.

A thorough knowledge of the various factors leading to under-achievement may help to prevent the consequences of these factors. Different cognitive and non-cognitive factors and al= so study methods and habits affect academic achievement. Aim of the research: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate a particular study technique. This technique is an adaptation of the well-known SQ 3 R-method. An attempt was made to find out whether this method could improve academic performance. Method of investigation: Firstly a study of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> literature was <b>undertaken</b> concerning the effect of different cognitive and non-cognitive factors on academic performance. The sample used in this study consisted of ten students in a Psychology II course. The psychometric instruments used in the research were discussed thoroughly with respect to their development and content. The experimental group was described in terms of the means of the respective tests applied. The experimental and control groups were then compared with regard to the changes in rank order in their class and their academic performance. Conclusion: The conclusion reached is that the differences between the two groups with regard to the change in the rank order in the class and their academic achievement are not statistically significant. However, there seems to be a tendency towards better achievement in the experimental group. Recommendations: It is recommended that more extensive research be undertaken in this field. Larger groups should be used together with other study techniques. Master...|$|R

The study seeks to identify how the participants influenced decisions {{as part of a}} social exchange process that took place during the organizational change. Specifically, the {{study examines}} values which may have influenced people in the institution to seek the organizational change. This study employs a single case study design bounded by time and events that took place from 1998 to 2001, prior to the institution's transformation, employing a qualitative, descriptive methodology. A review of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> literature was <b>undertaken</b> and a theoretical framework was developed for the study. Data was obtained from interviews with participants who experienced the change process and an examination of institutional documents. The data produced evidence of external trends and internal organizational factors that influenced individuals to consider changing TESST's occupational mission and training programs. The data was analyzed against the theoretical framework which served as a screening instrument for identifying values, linking variables with the appropriate theories and for validating or ruling-out variables. Most of the values that were identified in the literature review proved to have operated as variables that motivated the individuals to initiate organizational change. Two new variables were identified in the analysis. The study also examined how key individuals promoted the organizational change initiative by way of social exchange processes such as negotiation, bartering and trading. These activities incurred internal conflicts in the institution, external conflicts with traditional and competing institutions, and resolutions all of which were found to have been motivated by values/variables. The study concluded that no single factor influenced organizational change at TESST. Rather change involved a combination of factors. Further, change did not follow a linear process. Additionally, the framework proved to be a reliable instrument for analyzing data and warrants further application and research...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to explore the ways United States students develop through studying abroad at a Catholic university in Western Australia. The significance of the research lies in the belief that host and home universities {{should be aware of the}} needs of these study abroad students. The needs of these students were understood through an exploration of the challenges faced, the support received, and the personal and professional development attained. Four dimensions of the context contributed to an understanding of this study. These four dimensions were the University of Notre Dame Australia Fremantle, the UNDA three halls of residence, Fremantle and Perth cities, and the role of the residential supervisor. These contextual dimensions describe the environment, setting, and background necessary for the research. A review of <b>the</b> <b>relevant</b> literature was <b>undertaken.</b> In light of this review it seemed appropriate that the conduct of the study should be qualitative, interpretive, and utilise a collective case study. The collective case study utilised two methods of data collection: focus group interviews and reflective journal entries. The method of analysis for the qualitative data followed a format similar to that outlined by Miles and Huberman (1984) : data collection, data reduction, data display, and conclusion-drawing/verification. Both the focus group interview transcriptions and the journal entries were coded and analysed according to themes drawn from the three specific research questions for this study. Findings from the study indicated that the students developed both personally and professionally in light of their study abroad experiences. In the area of personal development the following were identified: independence, confidence, openness to try new things, and self-awareness. Both professional experience and professional possibilities were identified in the area of professional development. Three conclusions that have not previously been detailed in the literature were the development of global-mindedness, difficulties with differences in grading systems and, how these are interpreted by US students, and balancing multiple roles, particularly within new settings...|$|R
