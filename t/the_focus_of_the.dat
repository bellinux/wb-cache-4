5|$|After Parker {{was hired}} to direct the film, Gerolmo had {{completed}} two drafts. Parker met with Gerolmo at Orion's offices in Century City, Los Angeles, where they began work on a third draft script. Both the writer and director however had repeated disagreements over <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> story. To resolve the issue, Orion executives in New York gave Parker one month to make uncredited rewrites before green-lighting the project.|$|E
5|$|As {{reflector}} sight designs advanced after World War II, {{giving the}} pilot {{more and more}} information, they eventually evolved into the head-up display (HUD). The illuminated reticle was eventually replaced by a video screen at <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collimating optics that not only gave a sighting point and information from a lead-finding computer and radar, but also various aircraft indicators (such as an artificial horizon, compass, altitude and airspeed indicators), facilitating the visual tracking of targets or the transition from instrument to visual methods during landings.|$|E

40|$|In this report, we {{introduce}} a new wave-equation method of migration velocity analysis (MVA). The method {{is based on the}} linear relation that can be established between a perturbation in the migrated image and the generating perturbation in the slowness function. Our method consists of two steps: we first improve <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> migrated image and then iteratively update the velocity model to explain <b>the</b> improvement in <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image. As a wave-equation method, our version of MVA is robust and generates smooth slowness functions without model regularization. We also show that our method has the potential to exploit <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> residual prestack migration to MVA...|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century Madagascar had {{the most}} {{developed}} and modern school system in pre-colonial Sub-Saharan Africa. Access to schooling was expanded in coastal areas during the colonial period, with French language and basic work skills becoming <b>the</b> <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> curriculum. During the post-colonial First Republic, a continued reliance on French nationals as teachers, and French as the language of instruction, displeased those desiring a complete separation from the former colonial power.|$|E

40|$|Locating <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> a passively {{recorded}} seismic {{event is}} still a challenging problem, especially when the velocity is unknown. Many imaging approaches to <b>focus</b> <b>the</b> image do not address the velocity issue and result in images plagued with illumination artifacts. We develop a waveform inversion approach with an additional penalty term in the objective function to reward <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> source image. This penalty term is relaxed early to allow for data fitting, and avoid cycle skipping, using an extended source. At <b>the</b> later stages <b>the</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> image dominates the inversion allowing for high resolution source and velocity inversion. We also compute the source location explicitly and numerical tests show that we obtain good estimates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> source locations with this approach...|$|R
