40|$|U. S. and {{international}} auditing standard setters continue {{to raise questions}} about standard auditors' reports and are exploring alternatives to those reports. Government agencies and professional organizations are also raising questions about <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> report. These questions point to a continued existence of an “audit expectation gap. ” To investigate perceptions and misperceptions regarding <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> report, we conducted focus groups with five different stakeholder groups—financial statement preparers (CFOs), users (bankers, analysts, and non-professional investors), and external auditors. This approach allows detailed comparisons between {{the perceptions of the}} different stakeholder groups affected by <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> report. Findings include that financial statement users value the audit, but do not read <b>the</b> entire <b>auditor's</b> report. It is not clear to users, preparers, and <b>auditors</b> what <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> report is intended to communicate or the level of assurance being provided by the report. Stakeholders offered numerous suggestions to improve <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> report, but they also recognize those suggestions could significantly change <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> risk profile and increase audit fees.

5|$|A city {{councilor}} {{from each}} of the city's nine council districts is elected every two years, each serving a term of two years. Councilors are elected from their own respective districts based on a plurality voting system, and serve on the Tulsa City Council. As a whole, the council acts as the legislative body of city government, which aims to pass laws, approve the city budget, and manage efficiency in city government. In accordance with the mayor-council form of government, the Tulsa City Council and the office of the Mayor coordinate in city government operations. A third body of the government, the city auditor, is elected independently of the city council and mayor to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>auditor</b> can act in an objective manner. <b>The</b> <b>auditor</b> is elected for a term of two years. Phil Wood, a Democrat, held the position for 21 years before being defeated by Republican Preston Doerflinger in the 2009 election. The city serves as the seat of county government for Tulsa County, and lies mostly within Oklahoma's 1st congressional district, with its far northwestern areas in southern Osage County in Oklahoma's 3rd congressional district.

5|$|By March 2004 {{the cost}} {{had reached the}} sum of £430m (compared to an {{original}} budget of £55m in July 1998 when the architects were appointed). This equates to £85 {{for each of the}} 5.1 million people in Scotland. A report published by <b>the</b> <b>Auditor</b> General for Scotland in July 2004 specifically identified elements that contributed to both increasing costs and the delay in completing the project. His report criticised the overall management of the project and stated that had the management and construction process been executed better, costs could have been reduced. The report attempted to identify the reasons why there had been an acceleration in cost from £195m in September 2000 to £431m in February 2004 and concluded that over 2000 design changes to the project were a major factor. The building was finally certified for occupation in the Summer of 2004, with the official opening in October of the same year, three years behind schedule.|$|E

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to investigate whether}} a management decision to locate <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> report in <b>the</b> financial statements is explained by information signaling theory. The location of <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> report in <b>the</b> financial statements is explained by information signaling theory. The location of <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> report is being {{the focus of this}} study because a decision on the location of <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> report in <b>the</b> financial statements is the management's discretion. <b>The</b> <b>auditor's</b> report is important because it tells readers of the annual report whether the firm has kept all the records properly and that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with the approved accounting standards. We posit that a firm that conveys good news is more likely to place its <b>auditor's</b> report at <b>the</b> beginning of the financial statements than at the end, and vice-versa. Based on 698 listed firms listed on the Bursa Malaysia as on December 31, 2003, our evidence shows that information signaling theory does not support our prediction on the management decision to place <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> report. We find that about eighty percent of the firms in our study located their <b>auditor's</b> reports at <b>the</b> beginning of the financial statements. Therefore, it appears that it is the tendency of firms in Malaysia to place their <b>auditor's</b> reports at <b>the</b> beginning rather than at the end. Therefore, this signifies the importance of <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> report in <b>the</b> financial reporting framework. We reveal that none of the profitability measure, namely ROA, EPS and Tobin's q, is associated with the location of <b>the</b> <b>auditor's</b> report.

25|$|This {{determination}} {{affects the}} entire Single Audit because <b>the</b> <b>auditor</b> adjusts the examination accordingly. Since <b>the</b> <b>auditor</b> must provide an opinion {{to the federal}} government on whether the recipient and its programs complied with laws and regulations, <b>the</b> <b>auditor</b> performs sufficient tests and audit procedures (also known as audit work) to confirm the opinion is correct. Normally, <b>the</b> <b>auditor</b> greatly increases the amount of auditing for high-risk auditees, to ensure their opinion is correct. For low-risk auditees, <b>the</b> <b>auditor</b> is not as rigorous; but still recognizes that a low-risk recipient may still have compliance issues. Conversely, a high-risk determination doesn't mean the recipient is non-compliant, just that they're more likely to be.|$|E
25|$|After <b>the</b> <b>auditor</b> determines which federal {{programs}} to audit, <b>the</b> <b>auditor</b> performs a compliance audit that scrutinizes {{operations of the}} program—examining files, documents, contracts, checks, etc. <b>The</b> <b>auditor</b> investigates, to some degree, transactions between the federal program and other parties.
