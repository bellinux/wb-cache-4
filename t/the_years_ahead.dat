5|$|The {{renewable}} energy industry supports more than 11,500 jobs in Scotland, {{according to a}} 2013 study by Scottish Renewables. However a 2011 study by 4-Consulting calculated that there was probably a small net loss in jobs in Scotland from government support for {{renewable energy}}. They estimated that the offshore wind industry might create between 300–2,200 long-term jobs by 2020. With 20 GW of renewable energy projects in the pipeline, the sector {{has the potential to}} grow quickly in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>ahead</b> creating more jobs in the region. Glasgow, Fife and Edinburgh are key centres of offshore wind power development, and the emerging wave power and tidal power industries are centred around the Highlands and Islands. Rural job creation is being supported by bioenergy systems in areas such as Lochaber, Moray and Dumfries and Galloway.|$|E
5|$|Bethe left Germany in 1933, {{moving to}} England after {{receiving}} an offer {{for a position}} as lecturer at the University of Manchester for a year through Sommerfeld's connection to William Lawrence Bragg. He moved in with his friend Rudolf Peierls and Peierls' wife Genia. Peierls was a fellow German physicist who had also been barred from academic positions in Germany because his parents were Jewish. This meant that Bethe had someone to speak to in German, {{and did not have}} to eat English food. Their relationship was professional as well as personal. Peierls aroused Bethe's interest in nuclear physics. After James Chadwick and Maurice Goldhaber discovered the photodisintegration of deuterium, Chadwick challenged Bethe and Peierls {{to come up with a}} theoretical explanation of this phenomenon. This they did on the four-hour train ride from Cambridge back to Manchester. Bethe would investigate further in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>ahead.</b>|$|E

25|$|Later that spring, Scott {{returned}} to her beginnings as a comedian when she began work on her first comedy noir, Scared Stiff, with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Scott played an heiress who inherits a haunted castle on Lost Island {{off the coast of}} Cuba. Though Scott had fond memories of working on the set in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>ahead,</b> at the time of filming, she found it trying. Scott found Lewis' impersonations of her offensive, while a jealous Hal Wallis instructed the director, George Marshall, not to let the romantic scenes between Scott and Martin get too steamy. Despite Scott's best efforts, including making excuses for Lewis' behavior to the press, most of her scenes ended up on the cutting-room floor. Shooting took place late May to mid-July 1952. The film premiered the week of 28 May 1953 in Los Angeles. Despite the negative experience and reviews, Scared Stiff remains Scott's third favorite film.|$|E

500|$|In 1824, Seward was journeying {{with his}} wife to Niagara Falls {{when one of the}} wheels on his {{carriage}} was damaged while they passed through Rochester. Among those who came to their aid was local newspaper publisher Thurlow Weed.

Weed, deemed by some as one of the earliest political bosses, would become a major ally of Seward.

500|$|Cushing is {{primarily}} remembered {{for his role}} in the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Scandal. [...] In assessing his role in that episode, Thomas has suggested that his actions were motivated by something other than [...] "revulsion against what appeared to be an unwise contract with a railway company". [...] Instead, he believes that Cushing had concluded that he, rather than Rutherford, should be premier, and began to conduct himself publicly in such a way as to undermine Rutherford's authority. [...] Whatever his motivations, Cushing's resignation precipitated a scandal that ended Alexander Rutherford's political career, and in so doing had a profound effect on Alberta's political history. [...] In evaluating his legacy, Roome also considers his role in establishing the government telephone system, which in her opinion [...] "produced serious financial difficulties" [...] for the province in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>ahead.</b>|$|E

500|$|Brezhnev and Nikolai Podgorny {{appealed to}} the Central Committee, blaming Khrushchev for {{economic}} failures, and accusing him of voluntarism and immodest behavior. Influenced by the Brezhnev allies, Politburo members voted to remove Khrushchev from office. In addition, {{some members of the}} Central Committee wanted him to undergo punishment of some kind. But Brezhnev, who had already been assured the office of the General Secretary, saw little reason to punish his old mentor further. Brezhnev was appointed First Secretary, but at the time was believed to be a transition leader of sorts, who would only [...] "keep the shop" [...] until another leader was appointed. Alexei Kosygin was appointed head of government, and Mikoyan was retained as head of state. Brezhnev and his companions supported the general party line taken after Joseph Stalin's death, but felt that Khrushchev's reforms had removed much of the Soviet Union's stability. One reason for Khrushchev's ousting was that he continually overruled other party members, and was, according to the plotters, [...] "in contempt of the party's collective ideals". Pravda, a newspaper in the Soviet Union, wrote of new enduring themes such as collective leadership, scientific planning, consultation with experts, organisational regularity and the ending of schemes. When Khrushchev left the public spotlight, there was no popular commotion, as most Soviet citizens, including the intelligentsia, anticipated a period of stabilisation, steady development of Soviet society and continuing economic growth in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>ahead.</b>|$|E
500|$|Foraker {{returned}} {{to the practice of}} law, initially vowing to avoid politics; however, he received a number of letters offering him support in a gubernatorial race in 1885. [...] The 1884 Republican state convention elected Foraker a delegate-at-large to the national convention along with Congressman McKinley and Cleveland industrialist Mark Hanna. Sherman's political managers asked Foraker to play an active role in Sherman's presidential campaign, and to place his name in nomination at the convention, which he did, though Walters describes his speech as [...] "weak and unimpressive" [...] by comparison with Foraker's later efforts. [...] Other candidates for the presidential nomination included President Chester A. Arthur (who had succeeded the assassinated James A. Garfield) and John A. Logan, but the convention was dominated by the Blaine forces. [...] Sherman received 30 votes, mostly from Ohio, on the first ballot, but his total thereafter declined, and Blaine secured the nomination on the fourth ballot. [...] There was talk of Foraker for vice president; he received one vote, from New York delegate and Cornell president Andrew D. White. [...] The nominating speech, despite its flaws, made Foraker a national figure. [...] At the convention, Foraker worked with Hanna and with Charles G. Kurtz of Columbus: both would support Foraker in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>ahead,</b> though in the case of Hanna, only for a time. [...] In the fall campaign, both Foraker and Hanna supported Blaine, accompanying the New Englander when he toured Ohio in October. [...] However, Blaine was defeated by the Democratic candidate, New York Governor Grover Cleveland.|$|E
500|$|During the 1950s, Nevelson {{exhibited}} {{her work}} as often as possible. Yet despite awards and growing popularity with art critics, she continued to struggle financially. To make ends meet she began teaching sculpture classes in adult education programs in the Great Neck public school system. Her own work began to grow to monumental size, moving beyond the human scale sized works she had been creating during the early 1940s. Nevelson also visited Latin America, and discovered influences for her work in Mayan ruins and the steles of Guatemala. In 1954, Nevelson's street in New York's Kips Bay was among those slated for demolition and redevelopment, and her increasing use of scrap materials in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>ahead</b> drew upon on refuse left on the streets by her evicted neighbors. In 1955 Nevelson joined Colette Roberts' Grand Central Modern Gallery, where she had numerous one-woman shows. There she exhibited some of her most notable mid-century works: Bride of the Black Moon, First Personage, and the exhibit [...] "Moon Garden + One", which showed her first wall piece, Sky Cathedral, in 1958. From 1957 to 1958, she {{was president of the}} New York Chapter of Artists' Equity and in 1958 she joined the Martha Jackson Gallery, where she was guaranteed income and became financially secure. That year, she was photographed and featured on the cover of Life. In 1960 she had her first one-woman show in Europe at Galerie Daniel Cordier in Paris. Later that year a collection of her work, grouped together as [...] "Dawn's Wedding Feast", was included in the group show, [...] "Sixteen Americans", at the Museum of Modern Art alongside Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. In 1962 she made her first museum sale to the Whitney Museum of American Art, who purchased the black wall, Young Shadows. That same year, her work was selected for the 31st Venice Biennale and she became national president of Artists' Equity, serving until 1964.|$|E
