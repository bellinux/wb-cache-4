40|$|We {{present an}} exact, non-perturbative and fully {{analytical}} {{treatment of the}} entanglement dynamics for an isolated system of two coupled oscillators with time dependent frequency and coupling. The entanglement dynamics is analyzed following a sudden quench of the system parameters. We have obtained the solutions of the time dependent Schrodinger's equation (TDSE) for the system of two coupled oscillators under an arbitrary sudden quench. Using this solution, we are led to the exact analytical expressions for the time dependent Renyi and von Neumann entropies which are fully consistent with the TDSE. The <b>two</b> <b>site</b> Bose-Hubbard model in the tunneling regime is equivalent to this system. Our analysis thus predicts the patterns of time evolution of the entanglement entropies in the <b>two</b> <b>site</b> Bose-Hubbard model, which is amenable to empirical realization in cold atom systems...|$|R
