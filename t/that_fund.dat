40|$|Romer and Romer (R&R) {{reported}} <b>that</b> federal <b>funds</b> {{rate increases}} may raise expected inflation by revealing the Fed’s private information about inflation. Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (GSS) presented evidence <b>that</b> <b>funds</b> rate increases lowered long-term expected inflation. To choose between these hypotheses we examine how monetary policy surprises affect daily traded commodity prices, term interest rates, and forward interest rates. We find <b>that</b> <b>funds</b> rate {{increases in the}} 1970 s raised gold and silver prices and that increases after 1989 lowered gold and silver prices. We also find <b>that</b> <b>funds</b> rate hikes over both sample periods primarily affected short-term interest rates and near-term forward rates.

25|$|President Bush {{advocated}} the partial privatization of Social Security in 2005-2006, but was unsuccessful in achieving any reforms {{to the program}} against strong congressional resistance. His proposal would have diverted some of the payroll tax revenues <b>that</b> <b>fund</b> the program into private accounts. Critics argued that privatizing Social Security does nothing to address the long-term funding challenge facing the program. Diverting funds to private accounts would reduce available funds to pay current retirees, requiring significant borrowing. An analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that President Bush's 2005 privatization proposal would have added $1 trillion in new federal debt in its first decade of implementation and $3.5 trillion in the decade thereafter.|$|E

500|$|In March, 2015 the Nuclear Waste Administration Act of 2015 (S854) was {{introduced}} in the U.S. Senate. Its was intended establish a fully independent Nuclear Waste Administration (NWA) which would develop nuclear waste storage and disposal facilities. Construction of such facilities would require the consent of the state, local,and tribal governments which would be affected. The NWA would be required to complete a mission plan to open a pilot storage facility by 2021 for nuclear waste from non-operating reactors and other [...] "emergency" [...] deliveries (called “priority waste”). The goal would be to have a storage facility for waste from operating reactors or other “non-priority waste” available by 2025, and an actual permanent repository by the end of 2048. The current disposal limit of 70,000 metric tons for the nation’s initial permanent repository would be repealed. Any nuclear waste fees collected after S854 was enacted would be held in a newly established Working Capital Fund. The Nuclear Waste Administration would be allowed to draw from <b>that</b> <b>fund</b> any amounts needed to carry out S.854, unless limited by annual appropriations or authorizations.|$|E

Over the course of the game, both the aliens and the EXALT paramilitary group introduced in Enemy Within conduct their own research, granting their units new abilities.

It is difficult to halt their research completely, as the aliens capture a council nation early in the game and will occasionally launch missions with vastly superior forces that the player does not have a reasonable chance to defeat. The mod does add special missions that the player can launch to re-take council nations that have fallen under alien control.(at3:45) ...|$|E
