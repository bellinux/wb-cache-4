5|$|On 15 April 1945, the Nazi {{governor}} (Reichskommissar) of the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, {{offered to}} open up Amsterdam to food and coal shipments to ease <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> of the civilian population. Smith and Strong, representing SHAEF, along with Major General Ivan Susloparov representing the Soviet Union, Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld representing the Dutch government, and Major General Sir Francis de Guingand from 21st Army Group, met with Seyss-Inquart in the Dutch village of Achterveld on 30 April. After threatening Seyss-Inquart with prosecution for war crimes, Smith successfully negotiated {{for the provision of}} food to <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> Dutch civilian population in the cities in the west of the country, and he opened discussions for the peaceful and complete German capitulation in the Netherlands, to the First Canadian Army, that did follow on the 5th of May.|$|E

5|$|The speech continued, {{outlining}} the personal {{suffering of the}} nationalists {{during the course of}} the struggle.

5|$|Although much of Thoughts {{is devoted}} to platitudes and advice common to all conduct books for women, a few {{passages}} anticipate Wollstonecraft's feminist arguments in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), such as her poignant description of <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> single woman. However, several critics suggested that such passages only seem to have radical undertones in light of Wollstonecraft's later works.|$|E

5|$|Before {{coming to}} Cambridge, Burhop had {{not engaged in}} {{political}} activities. At Cambridge he encountered political debate generated by <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> caused by the Great Depression {{and the rise of}} fascism in Europe. While he rejected his parents' faith in favour of rationalist science, he did not reject their values, especially that of compassion for others, and there was no estrangement between them. At Cambridge he embraced socialism, and believed that scientists had a moral responsibility to society, one that included fighting fascism.|$|E
5|$|Casualties were {{cared for}} by medical officers, {{stretcher}} bearers, camel drivers and sand-cart drivers who worked tirelessly, often in the firing line, covering enormous distances in difficult conditions and doing all they could to relieve <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> of the wounded. The casualties were transported on cacolets on camels or in sand-carts back to the field ambulances, as the heavy sand {{made it impossible to}} use motor- or horse-drawn ambulances. Between 4 and 9 August, the Anzac Mounted Division's five field ambulances brought in 1,314 patients, including 180 enemy wounded.|$|E
5|$|Dickens {{was touched}} by the lot of poor {{children}} in the middle decades of the 19th century.

5|$|Philosopher Dewi Zephaniah Phillips {{published}} The Problem of Evil and the Problem of God in 2004, {{presenting a}} challenge to the Irenaean theodicy. Phillips maintained throughout his work that humans are incapable of fully understanding God, and presented an understanding of the moral diversity of human existence. With reference to <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> of the Holocaust, he rejected any theodicy which presents suffering as instrumental, arguing that such suffering cannot be justified, regardless of any good that comes of it.|$|E
5|$|The President of the Board of Trade, William Gladstone, {{resigned}} from the cabinet over the Maynooth Grant. The Corn Laws imposed a tariff on imported wheat, protecting British farmers from foreign competition, but making the cost of bread artificially high.

5|$|Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley {{rejected}} the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He {{argued that the}} magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to learn from it, {{as well as people}} who suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.|$|E
5|$|A French edition, {{translated}} by M. L. Carion (or by Louise Swanton-Belloc? (1796–1881)), appeared by 1853 published in Cambrai and in Paris. By 1857, the novel had {{been translated into}} 20 languages, including two independent translations into Slovene just one year after its original publication, which started the since-then uninterrupted dialogue between American authors and Slovene translators and readers. Later, it was translated into almost every major language, including Chinese (with translator Lin Shu creating the first Chinese translation of an American novel in 1901) and Amharic (with the 1930 translation created in support of Ethiopian efforts to end <b>the</b> <b>suffering</b> of blacks in that nation). The book was so widely read that Sigmund Freud reported a number of patients with sado-masochistic tendencies who he believed had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in Uncle Tom's Cabin.|$|E
