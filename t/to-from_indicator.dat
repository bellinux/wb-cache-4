5000|$|A typical light-airplane VOR indicator, {{sometimes}} called an [...] "omni-bearing indicator" [...] or OBI {{is shown in}} the illustration {{at the top of this}} entry. It consists of a knob to rotate an [...] "Omni Bearing Selector" [...] (OBS), the OBS scale around the outside of the instrument, and a vertical course deviation indicator or (CDI) pointer. The OBS is used to set the desired course, and the CDI is centred when the aircraft is on the selected course, or gives left/right steering commands to return to the course. An [...] "ambiguity" [...] (<b>TO-FROM)</b> <b>indicator</b> shows whether following the selected course would take the aircraft to, or away from the station. The indicator may also include a glideslope pointer for use when receiving full ILS signals.|$|E
