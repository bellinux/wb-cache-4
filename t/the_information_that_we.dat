The identification was based on mitochondrial DNA evidence, soil analysis, and dental tests, and physical characteristics of the skeleton consistent with contemporary accounts of Richard's appearance.

500|$|Strasburg's {{high profile}} {{and the success}} of the Nationals in the 2012 season made the innings limit a topic of {{national}} conversation. In addition to baseball writers, a number of other figures made their views on the topic known, including football broadcasters Troy Aikman and Terry Bradshaw, basketball reporter Stephen A. Smith, and even prominent politicians such as Rudy Giuliani and Mitch McConnell. Rizzo [...] defended the decision to shut down Strasburg and criticized the buzz surrounding it: [...] "It's a good conversational piece, it's a good debatable subject. But most of the people that have weighed in on this know probably 10 percent of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> know, and that we've made our opinion based upon." ...|$|E

6000|$|Let us turn, on {{the other}} hand, to the maker of vows. The man who made a vow, however wild, gave a healthy and natural {{expression}} to the greatness of a great moment. He vowed, for example, to chain two mountains together, perhaps a symbol of some great relief, or love, or aspiration. Short as the moment of his resolve might be, it was, like all great moments, a moment of immortality, {{and the desire to}} say of it exegi monumentum oere perennius was the only sentiment that would satisfy his mind. The modern aesthetic man would, of course, easily see the emotional opportunity; he would vow to chain two mountains together. But, then, he would quite as cheerfully vow to chain the earth to the moon. And the withering consciousness that he did not mean what he said, that he was, in truth, saying nothing of any great import, would take from him exactly that sense of daring actuality which is the excitement of a vow.

40|$|AbstractTraditionally, {{practitioners}} start {{a statistical}} analysis of a given sample x 1,…,xn by computing the sample mean E and the sample variance V. The sample values xi usually come from measurements. Measurements are never absolutely accurate and often, <b>the</b> only <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have about <b>the</b> corresponding measurement errors are the upper bounds Δi on these errors.

Different values xi from the corresponding intervals lead, in general, to different values of the sample mean and sample variance. It is therefore desirable to find the range of possible values of these characteristics when xi∈xi.
