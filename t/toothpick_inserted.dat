40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{detected}} periodontal pathogens in young children, and when detected the prevalence {{has been relatively}} low. In this epidemiological study, we determined the prevalence of periodontal pathogen colonization in young children and {{examined the relationship between}} periodontitis in mothers and detection of periodontal pathogens in their children aged 18 – 48 months. Children were selected and enrolled randomly into the study; tongue and gingival/tooth plaque samples were harvested and analyzed by DNA probe checkerboard assay for Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides forsythus. Clinical measurements included a gingival bleeding score in the children and a periodontal screening and recording (PSR) score in the mothers. Mothers having one or more periodontal sites with probing depths >  5. 5 mm were classified as having periodontitis. In this population, 71 % (66 / 93) of the 18 - to 48 -month-old children were infected with at least one periodontal pathogen. Detection rates for children were 68. 8 % for P. gingivalis and 29. 0 % for B. forsythus. About 13. 8 % (11 / 80) of children had gingival bleeding in response to a <b>toothpick</b> <b>inserted</b> interproximally. Children in whom B. forsythus was detected were about 6 {{times more likely to have}} gingival bleeding than other children. There was no relationship between bleeding and detection of P. gingivalis. 17. 0 % (16 / 94) of the mothers had periodontitis. When all mother–child pairs were considered, the periodontal status of the mother was found not to be a determinant for detection of periodontal pathogens in the floral samples from the children. However, the odds ratio that a daughter of a mother with periodontitis would be colonized was 5. 2 for B. forsythus. A much higher proportion of children in this population were colonized by P. gingivalis and/or B. forsythus than has been previously reported for other populations. A modest level of association between manifestations of periodontitis in mothers and detection of B. forsythus in their daughters was observed. University of Washington, Seattle, US...|$|E
