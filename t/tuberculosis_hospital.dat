The facility has since been used as a state office building and is now owned by Safe Harbor, a secure domestic violence shelter and advocacy center.|$|E

25|$|On June 19, 1952, it was {{announced}} that Queens General, Queensboro Hospital, and Triboro Hospital would be consolidated into Queens Hospital Center.

In spite of the unification, Queens General and Triboro Hospital continued to operate largely independent of each other. The College Point dispensary was closed at the end of August 1954, while Neponsit Beach Hospital was closed on April 21, 1955 due to a declining need for tuberculosis treatment.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the birth}} of the line, plans had existed to connect to the Common Tunnel of the Holmenkollen Line. The tunnel would allow the trams to operate {{straight}} to the city center at Nationaltheatret, giving faster travel times and removing the heavy Class A trams from the city streets. A plan for the route from Jar to Sørbyhaugen on the Røa Line had been made in 1919, but by the 1930s, the Norwegian Radium Hospital and a <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>hospital</b> at Ullern had been built in the immediate vicinity of the line. Concession for this route was granted on 30 April 1937, but Aker Municipality protested, because they did not want noise pollution at the hospitals. Another concern was that the magnetic field from the overhead wires could affect the instruments at the hospitals. The route was therefore moved, but this made construction more difficult due to worse geological conditions.|$|E
25|$|In July 1950 Neponsit Beach Hospital, another <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>hospital</b> {{adjacent}} to Jacob Riis Park in Neponsit, Rockaway, began operating as an annex of Triboro Hospital, with 24 patients transferred from Triboro to Neponsit.

2500|$|The Veterans Administration Hospital {{entered into}} {{service as a}} <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>{{hospital}}</b> in 1926 and became a general hospital in the 1960s.

Twenty-six buildings that were built prior to 1933 had been constructed following the local building codes and did not require seismic-resistant designs. These buildings suffered the most damage, with four buildings totally collapsing, which resulted in a large loss of life at the facility. Most of the masonry and reinforced concrete buildings constructed after 1933 withstood the shaking and most did not collapse, but in 1972 a resolution came forth to abandon the site and the remaining structures were later demolished, the site becoming a city park.|$|E

2500|$|In 1936, {{the city}} planned to {{construct}} a new <b>tuberculosis</b> <b>hospital</b> adjacent to Queens General and Queensboro Pavilion, pending funding.

Architect John Russell Pope began preliminary designs on the hospital in 1937. Groundbreaking on Triboro Hospital took place on August 3, 1938, attended by Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia. Excavating for the hospital's foundation began September 29, 1938. The cornerstone for the hospital was laid by Mayor La Guardia on September 28, 1939. The hospital was originally to have been dedicated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in November 1940, but the president was unable to attend. The hospital was opened by Mayor La Guardia on January 2, 1941. Costing a total of $3.5 million, 40 percent of the cost (around $1.5 million dollars) was defrayed {{by a grant from the}} PWA, with the rest of the money coming from the city.
