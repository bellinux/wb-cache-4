5000|$|Substantive <b>test</b> <b>of</b> transactions: {{evaluate}} the client’s recording of transactions by verifying the monetary amounts of transactions, {{a process called}} substantive <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> transactions. For example, the auditor might use computer software to compare the unit selling price on duplicate sales invoices with an electronic file of approved prices as a <b>test</b> <b>of</b> the accuracy objective for sales transactions. Like the <b>test</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> in the preceding paragraph, this test satisfies the accuracy transaction-related audit objective for sales. For the sake of efficiency, auditors often perform <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> <b>controls</b> and substantive <b>tests</b> <b>of</b> transactions at the same time.|$|R

The focus in this master's thesis is on building a simulator of an Alfa Laval separator to enable <b>testing</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> code. In this particular case, the control code being tested is written and executed in a soft PLC called TwinCAT. The simulator for testing code is written in C#. When testing code, automated tests are preferred because it enables easy regression testing. For this purpose a testing tool using a customized script language has been developed. Testing with a simulator is also beneficial because errors can be found early in the development process, thus reducing the number of errors left to be found when testing on hardware.
