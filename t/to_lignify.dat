Aggregates were fractionated according to size by sieving them. Each fraction was cultured in both media {{and changes in the}} distribution of cells in the cluster fractions were followed during culture, after which the {{formation and}} dissociation rates of cells in aggregates were estimated. There was {{a significant difference in the}} formation and dissociation of cell aggregates between the 2, 4 -D culture and the BA culture. In the 2, 4 -D culture, aggregates dis-sociated to smaller ones or to single cells in the early growth stage, and then grew into large aggregates. Moreover, most cells had a uniform capacity for aggregate formation. In the BA culture, aggregates grew rapidly to a large size in the early growdi stage. Lignification and tracheary element formation in the BA culture were especially stimulated in large aggregates derived from the large aggregates of the 2, 4 -D culture. Results of successive cultures of a particular cell aggregate fraction indicated that most cells had the potential <b>to</b> <b>lignify</b> or to differentiate tracheary elements. Thus, the switch-on of lignification or tracheid formation in the BA culture was determined only by cells in aggregate...|$|E
40|$|Lignin {{is a key}} {{structural}} component of plant cell walls that provides rigidity, strength, and resistance against microbial attacks. This hydrophobic polymer also serves {{a crucial role in}} water transport. Despite its abundance and essential functions, several aspects of lignin biosynthesis and deposition remain cryptic. Lignin precursors are known to be synthesized in the cytoplasm by complex biosynthetic pathways, after which they are transported to the apoplastic space, where they are polymerized via free radical coupling reactions into polymeric lignin. However, the lignin deposition process and the factors controlling it are unclear. In this study, the biochemical and developmental dependencies of lignification were investigated using a click-compatible monolignol analog, 3 -O-propargylcaffeyl alcohol (3 -OPC), which can incorporate into both in vitro polymerized lignin and Arabidopsis thaliana tissues. Fluorescence labeling of 3 -OPC using click chemistry followed by confocal fluorescence microscopy enabled the detection and imaging of 3 -OPC incorporation patterns. These patterns were consistent with endogenous lignification observed in different developmental stages of Arabidopsis stems. However, the concentration of supplied monolignols influenced where lignification occurred at the subcellular level, with low concentrations being deposited in cell corners and middle lamellae and high concentrations also being deposited in secondary walls. Experimental inhibition of multiple lignification factors confirmed that 3 -OPC incorporation proceeds via a free radical coupling mechanism involving peroxidases/laccases and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Finally, the presence of peroxide-producing enzymes determined which cell walls lignified: adding exogenous peroxide and peroxidase caused cells that do not naturally lignify in Arabidopsis stems <b>to</b> <b>lignify.</b> In summary, 3 -OPC accurately mimics natural lignification patterns in different developmental stages of Arabidopsis stems and allows for the dissection of key biochemical and enzymatic factors controlling lignification...|$|E

Localization of coniferin BGL in poplar is consistent with coniferin BGL in lodgepole pine that localized in the secondary walls of tracheids [19] and in Arabidopsis that localized in the cell walls of xylem or interfascicular fibers [21]. Localization of coniferin BGLs in lignifying cell walls {{seems to be a}} conserved trait in several plant species, implying that this localization of coniferin BGL is important for the formation of lignified secondary walls in both angiosperms and gymnosperms. Coniferin might be transported <b>to</b> <b>lignifying</b> cell walls [9] and hydrolyzed by coniferin BGL to supply coniferyl alcohol for lignification. This hypothesis is congruent with a putative mechanism proposed for gymnosperms [13, 19, 23, 24].|$|R
40|$|Hemp (Cannabis sativa) {{is used in}} many branches, e. g. in textile industry, power engineering, food {{processing}} industry, paper industry or animal production. The aim of this thesis is to summarize information about requirements of hemp for temperature, soil water, soil, nutrients and light in a form of literature research. It also concerns crops´rotation, affects on following crops {{and the influence of}} these magnitudes on seeds´yield and biomass. Hemp is a plant of a short day. Suitable soils for hemp growing are fertile, deep, well supplied by nutrients with neutral to slightly basic reaction. The plant is sensitive to lack or over-supply of water {{in the early stages of}} growth. Total annual rainfall in area of growing should not be below 500 mm. The plant needs the most of water during blooming period. The main nutrients influenting the fibre yield are nitrogenen and potassium. Phosphor influences seed maturing and the hemp grow for seeds needs more of it than hemp for fiber. The density of growth, i. e. seed rate depends on the aim of planting as well. For planting for seeds lower density of planting is better. Hemp is a good previous crop for grains. It can be grown on the same place for several years. The sowing term is from half of April to the half of May, it depends on climatic conditions. However, earlier planting is recommended. Harvesting is the most demanding part of growing because of the lack of special machines. Hemp for fibre is harvested during the blooming period (August). The later the harvest causes lower quality of the fibre because the stem starts <b>to</b> <b>lignify.</b> The harvest of seeds starts 5 to 6 weeks later than the one of fibre, when the seeds in lower half of the inflorescence are fully mature. By earlier harvesting, the seeds lose germinability, by later one there is a risk of huge losses of seeds by their falling out of the inflorescence. Illnesses and pests are in our area meaningless. Hemp suppresses weeds very well, thats is why chemical protection is not necessary...|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} of lignin {{in the outer}} cell-wall layers of spruce and poplar has been studied and the data obtained have been {{compared with those of}} the mature reference wood in which the secondary cell wall predominates. Materials with exclusively or predominantly outer cell-wall layers were examined. Accurate data relating to the lignin monomer composition and the number of β-O- 4 ´ bonds were obtained from pure middle lamella/primary cell wall lignin. Firstly, a 10 000 year old white spruce material, with most of the secondary cell wall missing, was studied. The aged lignin was composed of guaiacyl units only, and was slightly more condensed but otherwise similar to the reference lignin. Secondly, the developing xylem of a Norway spruce clone was analyzed during a growth season. In spring and early summer, growth is very rapid and the intention was to sample tissues in which the secondary cell-wall layers had not yet lignified, but where the outer layers at least had started <b>to</b> <b>lignify.</b> Microscopy, Klason lignin and carbohydrate analyses showed that the lignin in the developing xylem of samples from mid-June was located exclusively in the middle lamella. The lignin was more condensed, was composed of guaiacyl units only and contained more end-groups than the reference Norway spruce wood. Thirdly, the cambial tissues of a Balsam poplar clone were surveyed during a growth season. Both the phloem side and the xylem side of the cambial region were examined. The Klason lignin content and carbohydrate monomer distribution showed that in June and August the tissues on the phloem side contained material with mainly middle lamella/primary walls. In June, the xylem side in the cambial region contained mainly middle lamella/primary walls, and in August the secondary cell wall carbohydrates were being deposited. Both tissues contained lignin that was more condensed and had more end-groups than the reference lignin. In mid-June, the developing xylem had a ratio of syringyl to guaiacyl units of 0. 6, whereas the ratio for the reference wood was 1. 3. In the final study, lignin from the primary cell walls from a hybrid aspen cell suspension culture was investigated. The lignin contained only guaiacyl units which were more condensed than those observed in the reference poplar wood. QC 20100920 </p...|$|E

Adhesion of B. succinogenes in pure culture, and in mixed culture with R. flavefaciens, to the various types of cell walls in sections of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L. cultivar S 24) leaves was examined by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. B. succinogenes adhered to the cut edges of most plant cell walls except those of the meta- and protoxylem. It also adhered, though in much smaller numbers, to the uncut surfaces of mesophyll, epidermal, and phloem cell walls. In mixed culture, both species adhered in significant numbers to the cut edges of most types of plant cell wall, but R. flavefaciens predominated on the epidermis, phloem, and sclerenchyma cell walls. B. succinogenes predominated on the cut edges and on the uncut surfaces of the mesophyll cell walls, and its ability to adhere to uncut surfaces of other cell walls was not affected by the presence of the ruminococcus. Both organisms rapidly digested the epidermal, mesophyll, and phloem cell walls.

Histological traits of the living and dead leaves of desiccation-tolerant Xerophyta scabrida (Pax) Th., Dur. et Schinz. were investigated after safranin staining to examine the dynamics of rehydration and the process ofwater transport by safranin impregnation differences. Staining that appeared on the leaf's surface epidermal glands after 30 min of remoistening in living X. scabrida leaves suggested that glandular complexes could {{take part in the}} water uptake {{from the beginning of the}} rehydration process, when the xylemmight not have been filled up, yet. The leaves of living X. scabrida became fully impregnated faster than the dead leaves: Sclerenchyma staining started from the xylem while dead X. scabrida leaves were not able to rehydrate fully. The dynamics of rehydration by the orientation of immersing leaveswas also studied. Leaves immersed into the solution with their base downward became fully impregnated earlier than the leaves sank into the dye with their apex downward. Faster water supply in the former case might have been related to the earlier recovery of xylem integrity and the resultant spatially continuous water supply. The results indicate that the living leaves of desiccation-tolerant X. scabrida were able to uptake significantwater amount not only (and not primarily) through their vascular tissues but by external water conduction. Due to the specific binding of safranin <b>to</b> <b>lignifying</b> cell walls and its fast spread from the xylem to the sclerenchymatous bundle sheaths also confirm the potential role of sclerenchyma in the water movement of leaf tissues...|$|R

40|$|Parasitic plants develop {{specialised}} grafting organs called haustoria {{to attach}} to and infiltrate host plant organs to access nutrients. The {{outcome of the}} parasitic process is largely determined where cell walls of the host and parasite form the initial zone of contact at the haustorial interface. While haustorial cell walls show adaptation to virulence, host walls can be actively modified in response to attack. A combination of field and analytical microscopy techniques were used to investigate haustoria of Rhinanthus minor and Odontites vernus, annual native Irish hemiparasites, and grassland community structure associated with parasitism. The two species were confirmed {{to be associated with}} species-rich grassland habitats. In addition <b>to</b> <b>lignified</b> walls of haustorial xylem, required for solute uptake, other specialised wall types included; 1) unlignified flange-like thickenings of parenchyma adjacent to the xylem bridge, 2) thickened, unlignified walls of interfacial parenchyma and 3), primary cell walls of the hyaline body with associated paramural deposits. Arabinogalactan proteins (proteoglycans implicated in plant development) localised to the interfacial parenchyma and hyaline body and co-localised with extensins in partly differentiated xylem protoplasts suggesting roles in haustorial development and functioning. Metahaustoria, attached to the pot surface rather than host roots, provided new insights into the derivation of phenolic substances typically found at the interfaces between hosts and parasitic plants and generally believed to be synthesised by hosts as a defence response. A phenolic-rich interfacial secretion complex was produced by metahaustoria which analytical methods, including histological staining and Raman spectroscopy, indicated are compositionally similar to the interfacial secretions between hosts and non-hosts. This suggests the interfacial lignin-like substances are not related to resistance but instead are produced by haustoria to facilitate the parasitic process.

40|$|The present study, {{focuses on}} seed {{germination}} ecology and seedling growth of Opuntia ficus-indica (Cactaceae), a native species of arid and semi-arid regions of Mexico and invasive in the Mediterranean Basin. Shortly after collecting seeds in December 2014, scarification {{as well as}} the intra-specific variability in the responses of germination to light, temperature, salt stress and germination recovery were evaluated among three naturalized populations of this species in the Mediterranean. Moreover, seedling biomass production and the growth rate were measured. The most suitable method of scarification resulted the nail-clippers chipping. For all the populations, the germination trend was similar under light and darkness, but higher values of germination occurred under light. The highest germination occurred, for all the tested populations, at temperatures of 20 and 25 Â Â°C. Opuntia ficus-indica seeds were able to germinate up to 500 Â mM NaCl, but inter-population differences were observed. Nevertheless, seeds from all provenances showed a low ability to recover their germination after NaCl exposure. Biomass production of seedlings was similar for Sardinian and Sicilian populations, but not compared with the Spanish population. The growth rate of the Spanish population was, like the seedling biomass, different from those of Sardinia and Sicily. This study confirmed the presence of physical dormancy in O. ficus-indica seeds, due <b>to</b> <b>lignified</b> teguments in the seed testa and a secondary dormancy induced by the exposition to salinity. Even if many naturalized populations occur in the Mediterranean ecosystems, it seems this species has not acquired the Mediterranean germination syndrome. The ability of the seeds to germinate at high NaCl concentrations reveals a potential growth of O. ficus-indica in close coastline areas and in soils with high salt concentrations. These results could be important to predict where this species will spread in the Mediterranean Basin, threatening the biodiversity of coastal ecosystems, especially in islands...|$|R

40|$|A {{sensitive}} tissue-print assay for {{the detection}} and histological localization of H 2 O 2 in freshly cut organ sections was developed by impregnating nitrocellulose paper {{with a mixture of}} Kl and soluble starch. H 2 O 2 transferred from the cut surface of the section to the dried paper forms I 2, which can be visualized by the intensely colored I 2 -starch complex. The detection limit of the assay is in the range of 0. 1 to 0. 2 mmol L- 1 H 2 O 2. Due to the rapid immobilization of H 2 O 2 in the paper, very clear prints of the tissue distribution of H 2 O 2 can be obtained with a spatial resolution on the level of single cells. The application of this rapid and simple assay is explored in five experimental examples demonstrating that the in vivo level of H 2 O 2 varies strikingly in different tissues and can be regulated by developmental factors such as hormones, light, and wounding. The results show that: (a) In the hypocotyl of soybean (Glycine max L.) seedlings the apoplastic H 2 O 2 level increases strongly from top to base, accompanied by characteristic changes in its histological distribution. (b) In the epicotyl of pea (Pisum sativum L.) seedlings the induction of lateral expansion by ethylene is correlated with a depletion of H 2 O 2 in the cell walls of the expanding tissues.

Moreover, it is easily peeled {{off from the}} lignified secondary wall during sectioning with the microtome. These facts {{give the impression that}} the G-layer is attached only loosely to the remainder of the secondary wall, which contradicts its active role in tensile stress generation. However, Clair et al. reported that G-layer detachment, often observed in the microtomed surface of the fresh block, disappears at a distance greater than 100  μm from the primary surface of the block that has previously been embedded in resin after being oven dried [50]. From those observations, they concluded that the G-layer was effectively attached <b>to</b> the <b>lignified</b> wall in in-situ conditions, while the observed detachment of the G-layer is a mere artifact of the sectioning, caused by the creation of a free surface and triggered by the cutting process. The tension of the G-layer being balanced by the compression of other layers, the creation of free surface results in stress redistribution in its vicinity, which accounts for both the apparent deformation and easy detachment of the G-layer from the lignified wall after the action of sectioning initiated the crack propagation. Based on their findings, we can consider that the characteristic behavior of G-fiber can be, indeed, attributed to the intrinsic property of G-layer [42, 44, 46, 48, 51 – 56].|$|R

However, the interaction of the resulting plants with the environment must be analyzed carefully to ensure that there are no undesirable side effects of lignin modification. We show here that Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with impaired 5 -hydroxyguaiacyl O-methyltransferase (known as caffeate O-methyltransferase; COMT) function were more susceptible to various bacterial and fungal pathogens. Unexpectedly, asexual sporulation of the downy mildew pathogen, Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, was impaired on these mutants. Enhanced resistance to downy mildew was not correlated with increased plant defense responses in comt 1 mutants but coincided with a higher frequency of oomycete sexual reproduction within mutant tissues. Comt 1 mutants but not wild-type Arabidopsis accumulated soluble 2 -O- 5 -hydroxyferuloyl-l-malate. The compound weakened mycelium vigor and promoted sexual oomycete reproduction when applied to a homothallic oomycete in vitro. These findings suggested that the accumulation of 2 -O- 5 -hydroxyferuloyl-l-malate accounted for the observed comt 1 mutant phenotypes during the interaction with H. arabidopsidis.

In older soybean stems, HRGP genes are expressed exclusively in cambium cells and GRP genes are most heavily expressed in newly differentiated secondary xylem cells. Similar expression patterns of HRGPs and of GRPs were found in soybean petioles, seedcoats, and young hypocotyls, and also in bean petioles and stems. HRGPs and GRPs become insolubilized in soybean stem cell walls. Three major HRGP mRNAs and two major GRP mRNAs accumulate in soybean stems.

Here, we report that the amounts of borate cross-linked RG-II present in the sporophyte primary walls of members of the most primitive extant vascular plant groups (Lycopsida, Filicopsida, Equisetopsida, and Psilopsida) are comparable with the amounts of RG-II in the primary walls of angiosperms. By contrast, the gametophyte generation of members of the avascular bryophytes (Bryopsida, Hepaticopsida, and Anthocerotopsida) have primary walls that contain small amounts (approximately 1 % of the amounts of RG-II present in angiosperm walls) of an RG-II-like polysaccharide. The glycosyl sequence of RG-II is conserved in vascular plants, but these RG-IIs are not identical because the non-reducing l-rhamnosyl residue present on the aceric acid-containing side chain of RG-II of all previously studied plants is replaced by a 3 -O-methyl rhamnosyl residue in the RG-IIs isolated from Lycopodium tristachyum, Ceratopteris thalictroides, Platycerium bifurcatum, and Psilotum nudum. Our data indicate that the amount of RG-II incorporated into the walls of plants increased during the evolution of vascular plants from their bryophyte-like ancestors. Thus, the acquisition of a boron-dependent growth habit may be correlated with the ability of vascular plants to maintain upright growth and <b>to</b> form <b>lignified</b> secondary walls. The conserved structures of pteridophyte, lycophyte, and angiosperm RG-IIs suggests that the genes and proteins responsible for the biosynthesis of this polysaccharide appeared early in land plant evolution and that RG-II has a fundamental role in wall structure...|$|R
40|$|Tight {{control of}} cell/tissue {{identity}} {{is essential for}} a correct and functional organ patterning, {{an important component of}} overall fruit development and eventual maturation and ripening. Despite many investigations regarding the molecular determinants of cell identity in fruits of different species, a useful model able to depict the regulatory networks governing this relevant part of fruit development is still missing. Here we described the peach fruit as a system to link the phenotype of a slow ripening (SR) selection to an altered transcriptional regulation of genes involved in determination of mesocarp cell identity providing insight toward molecular regulation of fruit tissue formation. Morpho-anatomical observations and metabolomics analyses performed during fruit development on the reference cultivar Fantasia, compared to SR, revealed that the mesocarp of SR maintained typical immaturity traits (e. g. small cell size, high amino acid contents and reduced sucrose) throughout development, along with a strong alteration of phenylpropanoid contents, resulting in accumulation of phenylalanine and lignin. These findings suggest that the SR mesocarp is phenotypically similar <b>to</b> a <b>lignifying</b> endocarp. <b>To</b> test this hypothesis, the expression of genes putatively involved in determination of drupe tissues identity was assessed. Among these, the peach HEC 3 -like gene FLESHY showed a strongly altered expression profile consistent with pit hardening and fruit ripening, generated at a post-transcriptional level. A double function for FLESHY in channelling the phenylpropanoid pathway to either lignin or flavour/aroma is suggested, along with its possible role in triggering auxin-ethylene cross talk at the start of ripening...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- A hydroponic {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to compare root anatomy and hydraulic conductivity of four barley cultivars including Valfajr, Karoon, Afzal and Zarjo under salt stress conditions. The results showed that under salt stress, the minimum diameter of vessels was observed in the peripheral metaxylem of seminal roots of Valfajr cultivar and in adventitious roots; Karoon with 19 ± 3 µm had maximum diameter of vessels. In all barely cultivars, salt stress affected the diameter of central and peripheral metaxylem vessels more negatively {{in comparison to the}} number of the vessels. The mature xylem vessels of the seminal roots of the Valfajr and Zarjo cultivars had the most lignified cell walls. When the plants were exposed to salt stress, the casparian bands could be detected more in the seminal roots as U-shape and not in the adventitious roots. The lowest lignification thickness of cell wall (0. 78 µm) was observed in the central metaxylem vessels of adventitious roots of Afzal cultivar under salt stress. Also, Afzal cultivar with highest surface area and lowest thickness of lignified cell walls, had the highest seminal root hydraulic conductivity (5. 84 × 10 - 9 m s- 1 MPa- 1), whereas hydraulic conductivity was decreased to 3. 21 and 3. 17 × 10 - 9 m s- 1 MPa- 1 in Valfajr and Zarjo cultivars, respectively. Overall, Afzal and Karoon cultivars were found to perform better in water uptake at the early stages of growth due <b>to</b> less <b>lignified</b> cell walls of xylem in seminal and adventitious roots under salt stress conditions. Further research on hydraulic conductivity could be recommended. Article history...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} recent {{technological}} developments in light and {{scanning electron microscopy}} closely used for research on forage cell wall degradation in ruminants, are reviewed. The indigestibility of forages by rumen microorganisms used to be ascribed mainly to an overall presence of lignin in the plant material. However, early light microscopic observations without application of histochemical staining revealed that some leaf and stem tissues were degraded completely. The early use of lignin detecting dyes, such as acid phloroglucinol or safranin, in light microscopy made it possible <b>to</b> discriminate between <b>lignified</b> undegradable and unlignified degradable plant tissues. The introduction of the scanning electron microscope enabled a further discrimination between degradable and undegradable cell wall and cell wall layers in plant tissues. As a result of continuous improvement of the techniques used in microscopy, e. g. section to slide, mirror sectioning, microspectrophotometry and cryo-ultramilling, forage indigestibility can now {{be attributed to the}} specific deposition and location of cutin/suberin or lignin layers inside the plant cell wall. These structural layers form barriers hindering access of rumen microorganisms to degradable parts of the cell wall...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the wound healing in sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas Lam.) when exposed to tropical conditions typical for marketing (RH 50 % to 73 %, T 25 oC to 30 oC). The physiological processes during healing are revisited. Under sub-optimal humidities (65 % +/- 10) the depth of the lignified layer i. e. the thickness of the desiccated cell layers is affected by both cultivar and humidity. Some cultivars consistently failed <b>to</b> produce a <b>lignified</b> layer and for others the layer is often not continuous. The continuity of the lignified layer is more important for effectiveness of wound healing than the actual thickness. A method for assessing efficiency of wound healing based on assessing the continuity of lignified layers was developed, and called the lignification index. Would healing efficiency as measured by the lignification index was found to be a major factor for the shelf-life of sweet potato cultivars. Lignification of wounds correlates with reduced rate of weight loss and reduced susceptibility to microbial infection. A high dry matter content in cultivars correlated with a low lignification index. This relationship was consistent for 5 trials, including 34 cultivars...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{key element}} of the biomechanical design of trees is their ability to {{generate}} largemechanical stresses in wood at the stem periphery. This function {{is necessary for the}} tree tocontrol the orientation of its axes, and therefore to grow in height, maintain its branches at anoptimal angle or achieve adaptive reorientations (Fournier et al., 2013). This “maturationstress” appears in wood fibres during their cellular maturation when their secondary cell wallis thickening. In hardwoods, the stress asymmetry is generated by the formation of specificfibres with a very high tensile growth stress on the upper side of the inclined axis. Theresulting tension wood has microstructural features highly different from the normal wood. Tension wood in almost all temperate species has a specific gelatinous cell wall layer, calledG-layer, that is not lignified and highly mesoporous (Chang et al., 2015). It has been shownrecently, at the macroscopic scale, that cellulose tension appears during maturation and issynchronous with the development of this specific layer (Clair et al., 2011). Tropical species,like simarouba, are able <b>to</b> generate <b>lignified</b> tension wood fibres. The mechanisms of stressgeneration in tension wood fibres are not yet well known. The aim of our study is tounderstand these mechanisms and to know the spatial and temporal kinetics of the differentcell wall layers stiffening during maturation, in parallel with tensile stress generation. Contact-Resonance Atomic Force Microscopy, CR-AFM, was used here to address thisquestion on embedded samples (Arnould and Arinero, 2015) using dual resonance frequencytracking (DRFT, Rodriguez et al., 2007). Change in the contact modulus between, and within,each layer of the cell wall has been measured on several radial lines of developing fibres atdifferent steps. In order to understand the obtained results, and to estimate the sensitivity ofthe AFM indentation-like technique to the different cell wall components stiffness, an elasticanisotropic indentation model was used (Vlassak et al., 2003; Jäger et al., 2011). Finally,these mechanical measurements have been compared to topochemical data obtained on thesame fibres...|$|R
40|$|Fifty orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) genotypes {{from two}} {{maturity}} groups {{were used to}} investigate relationships between digestibility and morphological traits. Genotypes were selected for blade width, blade length, tiller number, growth habit and seed weight. Plants were harvested from a field planting in spring and summer, and were separated into plant parts before determining in vitro digestible dry matter (IVDDM). Blade width was most consistently associated with IVDDM, with wide-blade genotypes being more digestible than narrow-blade genotypes. Also, stem and blade width were positively correlated with IVDDM. Negative correlation existed between IVDDM and stem length. Differences in digestibility were greatest in stems of reproductive tillers suggesting that stem IVDDM selection {{may be more important}} than leaf IVDDM selection for quality improvements;A second study was conducted to determine whether grind size influenced digestion kinetics of orchardgrass selected for divergent morphological traits. Plants from two maturity groups were selected for short, long, narrow, or wide leaf blades. Stems from Spring growth and leaves from regrowth were ground to pass an 8 - or 1 -mm screen. Digestion lag, potentially digestible cell wall (PDCW) concentration, and digestion rate of PDCW were determined by using a first order, nonlinear model. The results indicate that grinding material through a 1 -mm screen did not limit the expression of morphological differences for IVDDM;Anatomical characteristics were examined for narrow- and wide-blade genotypes from two maturity groups. Blade, sheath, and stem samples from Spring growth were collected, fixed, and preserved in formaldehyde-acetic acid-ethanol solution. Samples were embedded in paraffin and stained with safranin <b>to</b> identify <b>lignified</b> cell walls. Total cross sectional area and cross sectional area stained for lignin were quantified by image analysis. Wide-blade clones had the or more lignin in stems than narrow-blade clones, but wide-blade clones had less lignin as a proportion of the cross sectional area than narrow-blade clones. This study shows that differences in digestibility between narrow- and wide-blade clones and between maturity groups may be attributed to variation in lignin deposition...|$|R
40|$|Tension wood xylem of {{arboreal}} eudicot species often produces unusual wood fiber, called {{gelatinous fiber}} (G-fiber). The G-fiber forms a gelatinous layer (G-layer) as the innermost {{layer of the}} multi-layered cell wall. The G-fiber generates a high tensile growth stress, which enables the hardwood species to perform the negative-gravitropic behaviors in its inclined shoot. However, the tension wood often causes various obstacles when we use the forest resources as the raw material for the timber products. Examples are the processing defects caused by its abnormal growth stress. Other examples are a high longitudinal Young's modulus and a high longitudinal drying shrinkage; their combined effect causes serious processing defects during the lumbering and drying process, e. g., distortion and cleavage of the sawn lumber, and so forth. Some researchers consider that characteristic properties of the G-fiber should {{be attributed to the}} intrinsic behaviors of the G-layer, while others emphasize the role of other lignified layer because the G-layer is often peeled off the lignified layer in the same direction during microtoming. Lately, Clair et al. revealed that detachment of the G-layer is an artifact that is caused by the stress concentration from the microtome blade, and they concluded that the G-layer is strongly attached <b>to</b> the <b>lignified</b> layer even in the oven-dried specimen. This positively supports the idea that the characteristic behaviors of the G-fiber originate from the property of the G-layer. However, the researchers still have no explanation for the generation mechanism of those G-layer properties. In our presentation, we focused our attentions on the moisture dependent changes of the longitudinal Young's modulus and the longitudinal shrinkages in two Quercus acctissima containing the tension wood xylem. And, we revealed the astonishing difference of those properties between G-layer and the lignified wall (= normal wood cell wall). Based on the obtained results, we propose a model of fine structure of the G-layer (and that of the <b>lignified</b> wall) <b>to</b> explain what is going on the drying G-layer...|$|R
30|$|Many {{microorganisms}} can attack cellulose, but few taxa can completely degrade it. In terrestrial environments, cellulose tends <b>to</b> {{be highly}} <b>lignified</b> {{and more difficult}} to degrade; both fungi and Actinomycetes can obtain access to cellulose in woody tissue due to their hyphal growth form. In contrast, {{little is known about the}} contributions of different groups of microorganisms to cellulose degradation in aquatic ecosystems. Bacteria appear to be the major degraders of lignocellulose in many aquatic environments (Benner et al. 1986). Gonzalez et al. (1997) found that while both bacteria and fungi can be involved in the degradation of lignin, bacteria are probably responsible for the utilization of the most refractory components. Moran and Hodson (1989) found that Bacteria are capable of using both the soluble fraction of the vascular plant, and the highly refractory lignocellulosic fraction, which is deposited as particulate detritus. They also found that degradation of plant material is predictable as its rate of degradation dependent on nitrogen, lignin content, and the C/N ratio. Both sea grasses and mangrove are the major contributors of lignocellulose in coastal marine ecosystems, and although contrary reports fungi play an important role in lignocellulose degradation in these ecosystems (Raghukumar et al. 1999).|$|R
30|$|The {{distribution}} and environmental responsiveness of suberized and lignified endodermal and outer cell layers suggest a role protecting root function in waterlogged and drying soils. Their importance {{for development of}} a barrier to radial oxygen loss during waterlogging is well-established (Colmer 2003). However, greater lignification and suberization of the exodermis and endodermis in stagnant solutions relative to aerated solutions were not related to hydraulic conductivity, although permeability to NaCl was significantly reduced (Garthwaite et al. 2006; Ranathunge et al. 2011). Greater thickening of sclerenchyma layers was found in irrigated compared with submerged rice roots (Mostajeran and Rahimi-Eichi 2008), which is probably related to lignification. Kondo et al. (2000) suggested that thickening of the sclerenchyma layer could {{play a role in}} structural support when the root is exposed to drying, hardening soil. In other species, e.g. sorghum and maize, the exodermis was observed <b>to</b> become more <b>lignified</b> with drought stress (Enstone et al. 2002). The fact that rice behaves differently, fortifying the endodermis and stele rather than the outer cell layers during drought, may be related to its adaptation to waterlogged conditions, including the presence of extensive aerenchyma. Fortification of the stele would maintain root function as a conduit for water and nutrient movement from lateral roots, while preventing loss of ions and water to the soil.|$|R
