50|$|After being {{released}} from PSII, PQH2 travels to the cytochrome b6f complex which <b>then</b> <b>transfers</b> two electrons from PQH2 to plastocyanin in two separate reactions. The process that occurs {{is similar to the}} Q-cycle in Complex III of the electron transport chain. In the first reaction, PQH2 binds to the complex on the lumen side and one electron is transferred to the iron-sulfur center which <b>then</b> <b>transfers</b> it to cytochrome f which <b>then</b> <b>transfers</b> it to plastocyanin. The second electron is transferred to heme bL which <b>then</b> <b>transfers</b> it to heme bH which <b>then</b> <b>transfers</b> it to PQ. In the second reaction, a second PQH2 gets oxidized, adding an electron to another plastocyanin and PQ.Both reactions together transfer four protons into the lumen.|$|R
