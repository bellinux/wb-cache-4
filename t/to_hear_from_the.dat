5|$|When {{the crowd}} finally reached Versailles, it {{was met by}} another group that had {{assembled}} from the surrounding area. Members of the Assembly greeted the marchers and invited Maillard into their hall, where he fulminated about the Flanders Regiment and the people's need for bread. As he spoke, the restless Parisians came pouring into the Assembly and sank exhausted on the deputies' benches. Hungry, fatigued, and bedraggled from the rain, they seemed {{to confirm that the}} siege was a simple demand for food. The unprotected deputies {{had no choice but to}} receive the marchers, who shouted down most of the speakers and demanded <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> popular reformist deputy Mirabeau. The great orator declined this chance at demagoguery but nonetheless mingled familiarly with the market women, even sitting for some time with one of them upon his knee. A few other deputies welcomed the marchers warmly, including Maximilien Robespierre who was still at that time a relatively obscure figure in politics. Robespierre gave strong words of support to the women and their plight, and his efforts were received appreciatively; his solicitations helped greatly to soften the crowd's hostility towards the Assembly.|$|E
500|$|Azaria did {{not expect}} <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> show again, but they {{continued}} to call him back, first to perform the voice of Chief Wiggum and then Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. He felt that, initially, [...] " [...] didn't seem too pleased with what I had done... was very exacting... was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, much to my surprise, he would still keep having me back every week. But each week, I {{thought it was going}} to be my last week because I really didn't think I had done that well." [...] Nevertheless, by the show's second season he was performing multiple recurring voices and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast. Since he joined later than the rest of the cast, Groening still considered Azaria the [...] "new guy". In addition to Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of Comic Book Guy, Carl Carlson, Cletus Spuckler, Professor Frink, Dr. Nick Riviera, Lou, Snake Jailbird, Kirk Van Houten, the Sea Captain, Superintendent Chalmers, Disco Stu, Duffman, the Wiseguy and numerous one-time characters. His co-star in The Simpsons, Nancy Cartwright, wrote that: [...] "The thing about Hank that I most remember is that he started out so unassuming and then, little by little, his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated. I realized Hank was going to be our breakaway star." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Black Widow" [...] was {{met with}} {{generally}} mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone called [...] "Black Widow" [...] a [...] "great song" [...] and praised its [...] "hypnotic chorus." [...] Rory Cashin of Entertainment.ie felt the track had [...] "future hit written all over it", and lauded Ora's [...] "sing-along chorus", Stargate's [...] "fantastic" [...] production, and considered the song to be a [...] "darker alternative" [...] to [...] "Dark Horse". A writer for MuchMusic felt [...] "Black Widow" [...] was [...] "a killer collaboration", {{in the same vein}} as Azalea's fourth single [...] "Fancy" [...] which featured Charli XCX. MTV Buzzworthy's Nedeska Alexis placed the song in her list of the 4 Songs You Have <b>To</b> <b>Hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> album, and said Perry [...] "worked her magic on the track." [...] Lucy O'Brien of The Quietus called the track a [...] "call-and-response anthem." [...] Marie Claire journalist Lauren Valenti deemed the song [...] "deliciously wicked" [...] and [...] "nothing short of brilliant", and commended Ora's vocal delivery on the track's hook. A writer for Rap-Up called Azalea and Ora [...] "a deadly duo" [...] on the song. Saeed Saeed of The National highlighted [...] "Black Widow" [...] as a stand out track on The New Classic and praised its [...] "strong chorus and slithering beats." [...] Saeed's view was echoed by John Wiley of The Heights who listed the song as one of two highlights on the record. Writing for The Sydney Morning Herald, Craig Mathieson stated, [...] "while her verses don't have the sustained length of her previous underground releases, Azalea skillfully upsets convention." [...] Kyle Moody of the Marquette Wire preferred Azalea's sound [...] "Black Widow" [...] to the more rap-orientated songs on The New Classic. Laetitia Wong Wai Yi of Today felt the track attained well-deserved hype and commended it for [...] "perfectly" [...] combining Azalea's vocal fluidity with its minimalistic dance breakdown. Glamour journalist Megan Angelo positively reviewed the song, writing, [...] "'Black Widow' isn't just an excellent get-up, get-ready, get-moving song for Friday night—it also happens to be a Women Killing Music summit {{in the form of a}} neat little track." ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 24, 2008, McCain {{announced}} {{his intention to}} suspend his campaign {{the next day and}} declared that he wanted to delay the first debate [...] "until we have taken action" [...] on the Paulson financial rescue plan. The reason given for the proposed postponement was so that McCain and Obama could return to Washington, D.C. in order to work on a legislative response to the unfolding economic turmoil. Obama rejected that idea, stating that [...] "this is exactly the time when the American people need <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> person who, in approximately 40 days, will be responsible for dealing with this mess." [...] A McCain adviser suggested replacing the Vice Presidential debate with the first Presidential debates and postponing the VP debates to an unspecified later date. Chancellor of the University of Mississippi, Robert Khayat, proposed that Obama hold a townhall meeting with the audience if McCain failed to appear. [...] On the morning of September 26, McCain {{agreed to participate in the}} debate, claiming that there had been enough progress in the financial bailout plan. [...] Three days later, however, the House of Representatives defeated the bailout proposal.|$|E
2500|$|Kemp {{expressed}} that the a main {{motivation for the}} series was <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> soldiers who generally don't have a voice compared to other public workers. Kemp stated: [...] "I've got many friends {{who are in the}} services, but you never really hear a squaddie giving his point of view. I'd never heard one talk publicly and I wanted to hear that voice." [...] This would be the view of the young men being sent to the foreign climes of Afghanistan from a situation such as being 18 years old and still living at home with mum and dad, as opposed to hearing from officers trained in media relations. The series would examine the experiences of soldiers at home, injured soldiers and the families of serving soldiers. Kemp wanted to ascertain the motivation of the troops, their level of political knowledge about the situation, their views on Muslims. Kemp stated his opinion that the public gaining an understanding of what it's like for the soldiers is a good thing whatever anyone's political views on the war., informing the public what was happening out there and what the soldiers are doing for the people back home who are [...] "fortunate to live in a [...] country".|$|E
2500|$|The {{friend of}} Gene's mother {{was also an}} {{acquaintance}} of the alluring silent film star, Rubye De Remer, which gave Gene {{the opportunity to meet}} Rubye and make a marked impression on her as well. [...] On Gene's behalf, Rubye in turn piqued the interest of director Clarence Brown. [...] It was early 1945 when MGM and Clarence Brown first embarked on a nationwide casting search for some fresh talent for The Yearling [...] And now months later, Clarence believed that perhaps the role of Orry Baxter might be suited for Gene. [...] So Rubye contacted Gene the day after the Paramount offer was made and persuaded her to meet with Clarence at MGM that day. [...] Despite the fact that MGM newcomer, Jacqueline White, was actually selected and had filmed some scenes that summer, Clarence was still not convinced that she was the right choice. As a result, Gene was called back three times to test for the role and eagerly awaited <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> studio each time. This experience earned her a $250 a week, long-term MGM contract which she signed as herself, Gene Roberts. Ultimately, Gene's youthfulness was the deciding factor that prevented MGM from assigning her this lead role. [...] When production resumed in mid-September 1945, Clarence had chosen 28-year-old Jane Wyman, who was on loan from Warner Brothers, to portray a more mature-looking character with co-star Gregory Peck. [...] The Yearling was released in May 1947 and went on to win multiple Academy Awards and nominations, including a Best Actress nomination for Jane Wyman.|$|E
