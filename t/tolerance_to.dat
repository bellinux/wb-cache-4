5|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of benzodiazepines that <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> therapeutic effects develops relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist. Tolerance develops to hypnotic and myorelexant effects within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects within weeks to months. Therefore, benzodiazepines {{are unlikely to}} be effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety. While BZD therapeutic effects disappear with tolerance, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist. Several studies have confirmed that long-term benzodiazepines are not significantly different from placebo for sleep or anxiety. This may explain why patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of benzodiazepine after the first loses effectiveness. Additionally, because <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> benzodiazepine sedating effects develops more quickly than does <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> brainstem depressant effects, those taking more benzodiazepines to achieve desired effects may suffer sudden respiratory depression, hypotension or death. Most patients with anxiety disorders and PTSD have symptoms that persist for at least several months, making <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> therapeutic effects a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective long-term treatment (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants).|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} rapid growth rate, short life span, and <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> {{handling}} and captivity, bigfin reef squids {{are regarded as}} one of the most promising species for mariculture. Although there have been several studies about this, there have been no reported commercial-scale cultures, as of 2011.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{users of}} {{benzodiazepine}} medication who are given midazolam experience reduced therapeutic effects of midazolam, due to <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> benzodiazepines. Prolonged infusions with midazolam {{results in the}} development of tolerance; if midazolam is given for a few days or more a withdrawal syndrome can occur. Therefore, preventing a withdrawal syndrome requires that a prolonged infusion be gradually withdrawn, and sometimes, continued tapering of dose with an oral long-acting benzodiazepine such as clorazepate dipotassium. When signs of <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> midazolam occur during intensive care unit sedation the addition of an opioid or propofol is recommended. Withdrawal symptoms can include irritability, abnormal reflexes, tremors, clonus, hypertonicity, delirium and seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. In those with significant dependence, sudden discontinuation may result in withdrawal symptoms such as status epilepticus that may be fatal.|$|E

The study also points to the need to provide data on <b>tolerances</b> <b>to</b> (+) or (-) Gy combined with (-) Gz, in addition <b>to</b> the lowered <b>tolerances</b> <b>to</b> Gy and Gz accelerations experienced by those adapted to microgravity. It is noted that such data can be used to establish limits on spacecraft acceleration maneuvering specifications...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide an {{overview}} of tolerance analysis. Tolerancing decisions can profoundly impact the quality and cost of product. There is a strong need for increased attention <b>to</b> <b>tolerance</b> design <b>to</b> enable high-precision assemblies to be manufactured at lower costs. Indeed, tolerance analysis is a key element in industry for improving product quality. Designers want tight <b>tolerances</b> <b>to</b> assure product performance; manufacturers prefer loose <b>tolerances</b> <b>to</b> reduce cost. There is a critical need for a quantitative design tool for specifying tolerances. Tolerance analysis brings the engineering design requirements and manufacturing capabilities together in a common model, where the effects of tolerance specifications on both design and manufacturing requirements can be evaluated quantitatively. Significant amount of literature is related <b>to</b> <b>tolerancing</b> methods. Summaries of state of the art, the most recent developments, and the future trends in tolerancing research can be found. This paper provides a classification of the issues from a mathematical point of view...|$|R

5|$|<b>Tolerance</b> <b>to</b> {{psilocybin}} builds and dissipates quickly; ingesting psilocybin {{more than}} {{about once a week}} can lead to diminished effects. Tolerance dissipates after a few days, so doses can be spaced several days apart to avoid the effect. A cross-tolerance can develop between psilocybin and the pharmacologically similar LSD, and between psilocybin and phenethylamines such as mescaline and DOM.|$|E

5|$|Alcoholism is characterised by an {{increased}} <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> alcohol–which means {{that an individual}} can consume more alcohol–and physical dependence on alcohol, which {{makes it hard for}} an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking. Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A depressed mood is a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E
5|$|Hilsenhoff Biotic Index {{values for}} Kettle Creek have been measured. The Hilsenhoff Biotic Index {{is a method}} of {{determining}} water quality based {{on the presence of}} macroinvertebrate families and their <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> pollution. It ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 being the least polluted. Kettle Creek ranges from 4.61 to 2.54 with an average of 3.32. The EPT Index (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera Index) has also been measured for the creek. It ranges from 10 to 25 with an average of 17. There are 285 vertebrate species that have the potential to inhabit the Kettle Creek watershed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the initial}} {{years after the}} conquest of Granada, Muslims in Granada and {{elsewhere}} continued to enjoy freedom of religion. This right was guaranteed in various legal instruments, including treaties, charters, capitulations, and coronation oaths.

Kings of Aragon, including King Ferdinand II and Charles V, swore to protect the Muslims' religious freedom in their oaths of coronation.|$|E
5|$|Once {{computational}} {{power was}} readily available, it became possible to easily design filters to minimise any arbitrary parameter, for example time delay or <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> component variation. The {{difficulties of the}} image method were firmly put in the past, and even the need for prototypes became largely superfluous. Furthermore, the advent of active filters eased the computation difficulty because sections could be isolated and iterative processes were not then generally necessary.|$|E
5|$|Peak {{benefits}} achieved for generalized {{anxiety disorder}} (GAD) may take up to a week. <b>Tolerance</b> <b>to</b> the anxiolytic and antipanic effects is controversial, with only some authoritative sources supporting the development of tolerance; tolerance will, however, develop to the sedative and hypnotic effects {{within a couple of}} days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing treatment abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Other risks include increased rates of suicide, possibly due to disinhibition.|$|E

40|$|Current {{ecotoxicological}} risk assessment for chemical substances {{is based on}} the assumption that tolerances of all species in a specified ecological community are a priori exchangeable for each new substance. We demonstrate non-exchangeability by using a large database of <b>tolerances</b> <b>to</b> pesticides for fish species and extend the standard statistical model for species <b>tolerances</b> <b>to</b> allow for the presence of a single species which is considered non-exchangeable with others. We show how to estimate parameters and adjust decision rules that are used in {{ecotoxicological risk}} management. Effects of parameter uncertainty are explored and our model is compared with a previously published less tractable alternative. We conclude that the model and decision rules that we propose are pragmatic compromises between conflicting needs for more realistic modelling and for straightforwardly applicable decision rules...|$|R

5|$|Photochemotherapy, or PUVA, is {{considered}} superior to phototherapy because {{it produces a}} longer-lasting tolerance of the radiation that initiates the outbreak. When treatment first begins, the main goal is {{to build up the}} patient's <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> UVA radiation enough {{so that they can be}} outdoors without suffering an episode of solar urticaria. Therefore, treatments are regulated at three per week while constantly increasing the exposure to UVA radiation. Once the patient has reached an adequate level of desensitization, treatments are reduced to once or twice per week.|$|E
5|$|Side {{effects can}} include a {{decrease}} in efforts to breathe, low blood pressure, and sleepiness. <b>Tolerance</b> <b>to</b> its effects and withdrawal syndrome may occur following long-term use. Paradoxical effects, such as increased activity, can occur especially in children and older people.

5|$|The oribi {{has been}} {{classified}} as Least Concern by the IUCN. The total population (as of 2008) {{is estimated at}} 750,000. However, the subspecies O. o. haggardi is listed as Vulnerable because, as of 2008, the total population is estimated at less than 10,000 mature individuals, and is feared to be declining. Hunting is a relatively minor threat, since the oribi shows some <b>tolerance</b> <b>to</b> hunting. Nevertheless, the steep fall of 92% in oribi populations in Comoé National Park (Côte d'Ivoire) {{has been attributed to}} poaching.
