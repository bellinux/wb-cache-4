They get married and tell their friends about the news, despite Grace's best friend Will's (Eric McCormack) unease about the whole idea.

5|$|As {{the power}} and {{reputation}} of Pietro II grew, the Venetian people began <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> he was secretly planning to establish a hereditary monarchy. Their fears were confirmed when his son, Otto Orseolo (named after Otto III), assumed the title of Doge upon Pietro II's death in 1009, thereby becoming the youngest Doge in Venetian history {{at the age of}} 16. Scandal marked much of Otto's reign as he showed a clear inclination toward nepotism by elevating several relatives to positions of power. In 1026, he was deposed by his enemies and exiled to Constantinople, but his successor, Pietro Barbolano, had such difficulty in attempting to unite the city that it seemed infighting would once again seize Venice.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a young roguish prince, Fiyero, {{has arrived}} at Shiz. Galinda is charmed when Fiyero shares his life {{philosophy}} ("Dancing Through Life"). They all decide {{to have a}} party that evening. Boq, a Munchkin who has developed a crush on Galinda, tries to invite her to the party, but she convinces him instead to ask Nessarose out of pity, leaving her free to go with Fiyero. Nessarose is delighted and tells her sister how she and Boq {{are meant to be}} together and how Galinda helped it happen. When Galinda offers Elphaba a hat to wear to the party, Elphaba begins <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> she was wrong about her roommate.|$|E

[...] "It just popped into my head that I hadn't heard Bowser's voice {{for two or three}} days.

5000|$|... "What's Happened to Blue Eyes" [...] {{was written}} entirely by Jessi Colter. The narrator {{discusses}} {{how she is}} looking for her male lover {{who goes by the}} name [...] "blue eyes." [...] She is curious <b>to</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> anyone else has seen him, while also hoping he has not decided to end their relationship.

60|$|And, {{while he}} nodded absently to O'Hay's lecturette {{on the state}} of the--opera, Graham fell <b>to</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> Paula Forrest, thus so {{completely}} the mistress of her temperament, might not be equally mistress of her temperament in the deeper, passional ways. There was a challenge there--based on curiosity, he conceded, but only partly so based; and, over and beyond, and, deeper and far beneath, a challenge to a man made in the immemorial image of man.|$|R
5|$|Medium Alison {{writes a}} letter to her parents but does not mention Joan or her recent {{realization}} she is a lesbian. Bruce orders Small Alison {{to put on a}} dress, but she would rather wear a jean jacket. Bruce tells her that she would be the only girl without a dress and that the other children would laugh at her; she leaves on the dress ("Party Dress"). Medium Alison proudly tells Joan that she has written {{a letter to}} her parents telling them that she is a lesbian, but begins to second-guess herself (beginning <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> she's asexual) until Joan kisses her. That night, she is excited and joyful at having had sex with Joan ("Changing My Major").|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Scully grows {{suspicious}} of Mulder when she thinks he may be helping a terrorist organization. Scully begins <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> {{he is now a}} traitor to the FBI. It is eventually revealed that Mulder is working as a mole in the group, and he is trying to stop them before they are able to use a biological weapon—that may have been created by members of the US government—which causes rapid degeneration of human flesh.|$|E
5|$|Before Cyrus and {{his army}} crossed the Aras River to {{battle with the}} Armenians, he {{installed}} his son Cambyses II as king in case he should not return from battle. However, once Cyrus had crossed the Aras River, he had a vision in which Darius had wings atop his shoulders and stood upon the confines of Europe and Asia (the known world). When Cyrus awoke from the dream, he inferred it as a great danger to the future security of the empire, as it meant that Darius would one day rule the whole world. However, his son Cambyses was {{the heir to the}} throne, not Darius, causing Cyrus <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> Darius was forming treasonable and ambitious designs. This led Cyrus to order Hystaspes to go back to Persis and watch over his son strictly, until Cyrus himself returned. Darius did not seem to have any treasonous thoughts as Cambyses II ascended the throne peacefully; and, through promotion, Darius was eventually elevated to be Cambyses's personal lancer.|$|E

5000|$|In another critique, Billboard noted [...] "Don't Worry" [...] to be a {{contrast}} from Chingy's previous releases, certifying it as [...] "more R&B-influenced fare" [...] which is [...] "equally effective" [...] as his prior hits. Entertainment Weekly gave the song overall praise {{and considered the}} single as competition for then-rival Nelly's string of chart-topping hits, questioning if Chingy's [...] "slick, articulate boogie rap" [...] would [...] "get Nelly <b>to</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> the Lou is big enough for the both of them." ...|$|R

5|$|Brown, though {{disappointed}} {{at being}} scooped, congratulated the Ortiz team on their discovery. He apologized for immediately overshadowing their announcement of Haumea with his announcement of Eris, {{and explained that}} someone had accessed their data and {{he was afraid of}} being scooped again. Ortiz did not volunteer to say that it had been he who accessed the data. Upon learning from web server records that it was a computer at the Sierra Nevada Observatory that had accessed his observation logs the day before the discovery announcement—logs which included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images—Brown came to suspect fraud. He emailed Ortiz on August 9 and asked for an explanation. Ortiz did not respond, and on August 15 the Caltech team filed a formal complaint with the IAU, accusing the Ortiz team of a serious breach of scientific ethics in failing to acknowledge their use of the Caltech data, and asked the MPC to strip them of discovery status. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating this was merely part of verifying whether they had discovered a new object. Brown began <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> the Spanish team had actually identified Haumea at all before they saw his own abstract and telescope log.|$|E
5|$|The season {{introduces}} Ted Mosby (voiced by Bob Saget) in {{the year}} 2030 as he sits his daughter and son down {{to tell them the}} story of how he met their mother. The story begins in 2005 with Ted (Josh Radnor) as a single, 27-year-old architect living in Manhattan with his two best friends from college: Marshall Eriksen (Jason Segel), a law student, and Lily Aldrin (Alyson Hannigan), a kindergarten teacher, who have been dating for almost nine years when Marshall proposes. Their engagement causes Ted to think about marriage and finding his soul mate, much to the disgust of his self-appointed best friend Barney Stinson (Neil Patrick Harris). Ted begins his search for his perfect mate and meets an ambitious young reporter, Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie Smulders), whom he quickly falls in love with. Robin, however, doesn't want to rush into a relationship and the two decide to be friends. Ted begins dating a baker, Victoria, but when she moves to Germany for a culinary fellowship, Ted leads Robin to believe that she broke up with him. As a result, Victoria breaks up with Ted and Robin begins to distance herself from him, though they eventually reconcile. As her wedding date approaches, Lily begins <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> she's missed any opportunities because of her relationship with Marshall and decides to pursue an art fellowship in San Francisco, breaking her engagement in the process. At the end of the season, Marshall is seen looking desolate and miserable, while Ted and Robin agree to pursue a relationship.|$|E

Illinois voters will see a ballot initiative that asks about increasing the minimum wage from Illinois's current $ 8. 25 an hour to $ 10 an hour. We got <b>to</b> <b>wondering,</b> <b>if</b> Illinois raised the minimum wage to $ 10 an hour starting January 1, 2015, who exactly would get a raise? We turned to the Economic Policy Institute for help crunching the numbers, and this Data Matters explores what we learned about who would become a "raised worker. ...|$|R

25|$|Flutie {{entered the}} USFL with much hype and fanfare. However, many began <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> the scouts who said Flutie could not compete on the pro level were right. In February 1985, Flutie made his USFL debut against the Orlando Renegades. His debut was not impressive, {{as his first}} two {{professional}} passes were intercepted by Renegades line backer Jeff Gabrielsen. The only two touchdowns that New Jersey scored came from turnovers by Orlando quarterback Jerry Golsteyn. By the time Flutie's debut was over, he completed only 7 of 18 passes, {{for a total of}} 174 yards, while running for 51 yards.|$|E
25|$|On the {{positive}} side, having two engines was a built-in insurance policy. Many pilots made it safely back to base after having an engine failure en route or in combat. On 3 March 1944, the first Allied fighters reached Berlin on a frustrated escort mission. Lieutenant Colonel Jack Jenkins of 55FG led {{the group of}} P-38H pilots, arriving with only half his force after flak damage and engine trouble took their toll. On the way into Berlin, Jenkins reported one rough-running engine, causing him <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> he would ever make it back. The B-17s {{he was supposed to}} escort never showed up, having turned back at Hamburg. Jenkins and his wingman were able to drop tanks and outrun enemy fighters to return home with three good engines between them.|$|E
25|$|As {{a matter}} of course in the Royal Navy, all captains who lost ships were tried by Courts-Martial. And so Belcher was tried by court-martial for abandoning the four {{seaworthy}} vessels, as were Resolutes captain, Henry Kellett; Intrepid 's commander, Francis Leopold McClintock; and Pioneer 's commander, Sherard Osborn. All were acquitted. Belcher, however, never received another commission and was scorned by the officers of his Court-Martial when they returned his sword to him in complete silence. Resolute continued to move slowly eastward in the pack ice, and one year later in the autumn of 1855 she was 1200 miles away from the place where she had been abandoned. In September 1855 an American whaler named James Buddington, from New London, CT saw Resolute adrift in the pack ice off Cape Walsingham in Davis Strait. He split his crew and sailed her back to New London, arriving home on Christmas Eve. Buddington's ship, George Henry, had preceded Resolute, and many were beginning <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> Buddington was still alive. The British government waived all claims to the ship upon learning of its arrival in New London.|$|E

60|$|At {{this point}} John Gayther, {{who had been}} in wars, began <b>to</b> <b>wonder,</b> even <b>if</b> {{soldiers}} in these days should engage in single combat with long swords, how one of them could be wounded in the left arm; but he did not interrupt the story.|$|R

Stevens later muses over lost opportunities, both with Miss Kenton and {{regarding}} his decades of selfless service to Lord Darlington, who may not have been worthy of his unquestioning loyalty. At the end of the novel, Stevens instead focuses on the [...] "remains of his day", referring to his future service with Mr Farraday and what is left of his own life.|$|R
500|$|Flo's {{new shows}} are a success, {{but after a}} while, the public's taste changes, and people begin <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> the times have not passed him by.

500|$|Ahsan Haque of IGN {{gave the}} episode {{a score of}} 8.2 out of 10, commending Chris's storyline and praising Stewie's {{temporary}} build, but criticizing the staleness of Meg's continued poor treatment. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave a much more critical review giving the episode a grade of a C. Heisler stated that neither of the storylines [...] "held any water", because they were [...] "ridiculously short". He also commented: [...] "I'm starting <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> this show is even watchable anymore – 18 minutes of filler, 45 seconds of inspired silliness." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to many of}} the DC Talk's other singles, the Christian message of [...] "Between You and Me" [...] – the importance of forgiveness and confession – is heavily implied, although it is not blatantly stated in terms of any specific religion. The only mention of God is featured during the breakdown of the song, which is absent in the radio edit. This removal of God from the song caused some fans of the band <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> the group's record label made a [...] "conscious effort to remove any overt Christian content from the song." ...|$|E
