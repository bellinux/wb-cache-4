5|$|Lewis Hamilton {{topped the}} time sheets in Saturday's free {{practice}} session, with Sebastian Vettel {{a tenth of}} a second behind, while Rosberg and Räikkönen completed the top four. Few cars took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> during {{the early part of the}} session due to high temperatures and strong winds. A brief red flag period occurred midway through practice when Daniil Kvyat spun out in turn four.|$|E
5|$|Manta is {{a flying}} roller coaster, which simulates the {{sensation}} of flight. It is designed to resemble the way rays—mantas in particular—appear to fly through seawater. Guests are initially seated upright on the trains in one of eight rows that hold four passengers each, accommodating up to 32 riders. Manta operates with three trains. Before departure, mechanisms in the station raise the cars up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>track,</b> such that the riders' spines are parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> Guests are secured in their seats using a locking lap bar, a vest-like harness, and flaps at the riders' ankles to hold their feet in place.|$|E

5|$|The drivers took <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> at 09:30 Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) for a 30-minute warm-up session.

They were separated by Michael Schumacher.|$|E
5|$|The {{first session}} on Thursday began in heavy rain. Although some cars {{attempted}} {{to carry out}} wet weather testing, the conditions forced all the teams back to their garages.

No one was able to improve on their qualifying times from the previous day.|$|E

Three lugers, {{including}} Kumaritashvili's teammate Levan Gureshidze, {{did not participate in}} any training runs on that day. Gureshidze decided to fly back to Georgia to mourn the loss of his teammate, and the athletes who participated all wore a black stripe on their helmets in honour of Kumaritashvili.|$|E
5|$|With {{a lot of}} rain falling, {{the second}} {{practice}} session saw only eight drivers set timed laps, with just 14 taking <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> Felipe Massa set the fastest time with a lap of 2:00.458. Both Lotus and Marussia did not run at all, while Fernando Alonso ran the most number of laps with twelve, following an engine change.|$|E
5|$|After one {{additional}} lap had been run, IndyCar officials red-flagged the race as the track was {{not suitable for}} racing. In addition to the debris left by the fifteen cars involved in the wreck, the asphalt surface was damaged and the catch fencing needed repair.

5|$|After {{over an hour}} {{behind the}} safety car, the field was {{released}} to race one last time with only twelve minutes remaining. With no close contests between the competitors, the field continued to run at less than racing pace, {{in preparation for the}} finish. The No. 8 Peugeot of Sébastien Bourdais briefly went into the pits, before returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> To ensure that the Peugeot finished the race, and did not break down before crossing the finishing line behind the winner, Bourdais stopped at the Ford Chicanes on the final lap. Once the No. 1 Audi had gone past to take the checkered flag, Bourdais restarted the Peugeot and finished as well. The No. 16 Pescarolo finished the race in third, the highest placed petrol car.|$|E
5|$|Borgarello won {{his second}} stage with his {{victory in the}} seventh stage, out-sprinting Micheletto and Carlo Durando. In the final sprint, Micheletto felt that Durando encroached him and moved ahead; this action caused the Italian fans to rush on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>track</b> in anger. The police then moved the two riders to a bar, until the crowd dispersed. Micheletto won his second stage of the race two days later. Before {{the start of the}} final stage, Micheletto became sick and Pavesi {{convinced}} him to continue the race and finish the final stage. Borgarello won his third stage of the race, while Atala-Dunlop consolidated their lead and the race win by having two riders, Micheletto and Galetti, finish in the top four.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Georges Passerieu {{broke away}} from a small leading group just before Douai because he knew he couldn't outsprint them if they all {{finished}} together. He was chased {{all the way to}} Roubaix by a Belgian, Cyrille van Hauwaert, and tension in the velodrome was high. The crowd heard that Passerieu had reached the stadium but nobody rode on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>track.</b> The leader was just about to ride in when a gendarme stepped into his path to check if his bicycle had the obligatory tax plate attached to it. Passerieu had already had a hard day and a shouting match broke out before he was allowed to continue.|$|E
