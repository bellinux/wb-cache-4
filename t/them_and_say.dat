500|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} among major film critics. Douglas won the Academy Award for Best Actor, {{and the film}} {{has come to be}} seen as the archetypal portrayal of 1980s success, with Douglas' character declaring that [...] "greed is good." [...] It has also proven influential in inspiring people to work on Wall Street, with Sheen, Douglas, and Stone commenting over the years how people still approach <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> that they became stockbrokers because of their respective characters in the film.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for the Twister Remix of [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] was also directed by Ray Kay, and released on September 8, 2012. For the music video, Spears sported a $20,000 sports bra and black leggins from Body Rock. It begins with four girls talking and resting in a dance studio. Once Spears {{enters the room}} and starts playing Twister with the girls, the scenario changes to a stage with a colorful background, and they all start performing a dance routine to a remix of the song. After the song stops and the four girls are seen laying down tired, Spears turns around to <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Way to rock the spots, ladies." ...|$|E

500|$|Wall Street enjoyed renewed {{interest}} in the film in 1990 when the cover of Newsweek magazine asked, [...] "Is Greed Dead?" [...] after 1980s icons like Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky ran afoul of insider trading laws. Over the years, the film's screenwriter Stanley Weiser has been approached by numerous people who told him, [...] "The movie changed my life. Once I saw it I knew that I {{wanted to get into}} such and such business. I wanted to be like Gordon Gekko". In addition, both Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas still have people come up to <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> that they became stockbrokers because of their respective characters in the film. In recent years, Stone was asked how the financial market depicted in Wall Street has changed and he replied, [...] "The problems that existed in the 1980s market grew and grew into a much larger phenomenon. Enron is a fiction, in a sense, {{in the same way that}} Gordon Gekko's buying and selling was a fiction ... Kenny Lay—he's the new Gordon Gekko". Entertainment Weekly magazine's Owen Gleiberman recently commented that the film, [...] "reveals something now which it couldn't back then: that the Gordon Gekkos of the world weren't just getting rich—they were creating an alternate reality that was going to crash down on all of us".|$|E
2500|$|The film {{initially}} had a [...] "John Hughes vibe" [...] to it, which concerned Reznor at first, {{but after}} meeting with Fincher and trying out different ideas with Atticus Ross, {{it turned out to}} work a lot more smoothly after all. Reznor recalled, [...] "The whole process was fun for me because I liked answering to someone I respect and not having to make all the decisions for a change." [...] Reznor and Ross would try sketches of songs, figuring they would have to revise it eventually, only for Fincher to get back to <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "I don't have anything bad to say – that's never happened before." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{is always}} {{disagreement}} between fishermen and government scientists... Imagine an overfished {{area of the}} sea {{in the shape of}} a hockey field with nets at either end. The few fish left therein would gather around the goals because fish like structured habitats. Scientists would survey the entire field, make lots of unsuccessful hauls, and conclude that it contains few fish. The fishermen would make a beeline to the goals, catch the fish around <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> the scientists do not know what they are talking about. The subjective impression the fishermen get is always that there's lots of fish - because they only go to places that still have them... fisheries scientists survey and compare entire areas, not only the productive fishing spots. – Fisheries scientist Daniel Pauly ...|$|E

2500|$|Vice Admiral William P. Mack {{recalled}} {{the antics of}} the diminutive vice chief: [...] "He would grab three-star officers by the lapels, literally shake <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'Why don't you do so and so or such and such?' They'd be thirty or forty pounds heavier than he was, but that didn't bother him at all. He was there for two years, which was probably about a year too long, because morale was getting pretty low. As I told Admiral Burke, {{it was just a}} matter of time before someone was going to slug him. You can't operate like that. Admiral Felt wasn't big enough to defend himself. I said that one of these days he's going to come at someone who's going to wipe up the corridor with him, regardless of how many stars he has." ...|$|E
2500|$|The jazz {{pianist and}} {{educator}} Kenny Barron commented, [...] "I have every record [...] ever made—and I try never {{to listen to}} them ... If I did, I'd throw up my hands and give up!" [...] Jean Cocteau dubbed Tatum [...] "a crazed Chopin". Count Basie called him the eighth wonder of the world. [...] Dave Brubeck observed, [...] "I don't think there's any more chance of another Tatum turning up than another Mozart." [...] Pianist Mulgrew Miller, commented on personal growth by saying, [...] "When I talk to the people I admire, they're always talking about continuous growth and development and I look at <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> 'Well... what are YOU going to do?' But, as Harold Mabern says, 'There's always Art Tatum records around'". Dizzy Gillespie said, [...] "First you speak of Art Tatum, then take a long deep breath, and you speak of the other pianists." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Ishmaelites {{are not at}} all idolaters; [...] {{has long}} been severed from their mouths and hearts; and they {{attribute}} to God a proper unity, a unity concerning which there is no doubt. And because they lie about us, and falsely attribute to us the statement that God has a son, is no reason for us to lie about <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> that they are idolaters ... And should anyone say that the house that they honor [...] is a house of idolatry and an idol is hidden within it, which their ancestors used to worship, then what of it? The hearts of those who bow down toward it today are [...] only toward Heaven ... the Ishmaelites today—idolatry has been severed from the mouths of all of them [...] women and children. Their error and foolishness is in other things which cannot be put into writing because of the renegades and wicked among Israel [...] But as regards the unity of God they have no error at all.|$|E

2500|$|Whilst across England, {{many people}} were accused of {{witchcraft}} by members of their local communities and put on trial, the cunning folk very rarely suffered a similar fate. It was unusual for a cunning man or woman to actually be accused of witchcraft; in the county of Essex for instance, whereas around four hundred people had been put on trial for witchcraft, only four of those were identifiably cunning folk. However, many of the professional witch-hunters and theologians continued to proclaim the cunning craft as being the same as witchcraft, with them both being caused by the Devil. One pamphlet published that espoused these views claimed that the cunning folk should be [...] "most cruelly executed: for that no punishment can bee [...] thought upon, be it never so high a degree of torment, which may be deemed sufficient for such a divelish [...] and danable [...] practise." [...] Their views however were {{not supported by the}} general population, who continued to see a distinct difference between witchcraft and cunning craft, with the witch-hunter John Stearne, an associate of Matthew Hopkins, remarking that whilst he and Hopkins wanted to prosecute the cunning folk, they could not because [...] "men rather uphold <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> why should any man be questioned for doing good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{species of}} whale were hunted in {{southern}} Labrador, the North Atlantic right whale and the bowhead whale. The former were {{taken during the}} [...] "early" [...] season in the summer, while the latter was caught from the fall to early winter (October–January). DNA analysis of the old bones after a comprehensive search of Basque whaling ports from the 16th to the 17th century, in the Strait of Belle Isle and Gulf of St. Lawrence found that the right whale was by then less than 1% of the whales taken. During the peak of Terranova whaling (1560s–1580s) the Spanish Basques used well-armed galleons of up to 600–700 tons, while the French Basques usually fitted out smaller vessels. A 450-ton Basque ship carrying 100 or more men required about 300 hogsheads of cider and wine and 300–400 quintals of ship's biscuit, {{as well as other}} dry provisions. In Labrador the men subsisted mainly on locally caught cod and salmon, as well as the occasional caribou or wild duck. This diet was supplemented with dried peas, beans, chickpeas, olive oil, mustard seed, and bacon. Before leaving for Terranova sometime in the months of May or June, a priest went aboard the ships to bless <b>them</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> a special mass for the success of the expeditions. Sailing across the stormy North Atlantic must have been a very unpleasant experience for the crew of up to 130 men and boys, as they slept on the hard decks or filthy, vermin-invested straw palliasses. Halfway there the smell of refuse in the bilge would have been unbearable. After a voyage of two months the ships would anchor in one of the twelve harbors on the southern shore of Labrador and eastern Quebec. Archaeological evidence has been found for ten of these harbors – Middle Bay and Blanc-Sablon in Quebec, and Schooner Cove, West St. Modeste, East St. Modeste, Carrol Cove, Red Bay, Chateau Bay, Pleasure Harbour, and Cape Charles in southern Labrador. Once the ice had disappeared the ships entered the harbors where the coopers went ashore and erected their dwellings and workshops, while most of the crew lived aboard ship. The boys were also sent ashore to chop wood and prepare meals.|$|E
