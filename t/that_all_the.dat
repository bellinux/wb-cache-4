5|$|A {{report in}} 1997 {{described}} use of sponges {{as a tool}} by bottlenose dolphins in Shark Bay in Western Australia. A dolphin will attach a marine sponge to its rostrum, which is presumably then used to protect it when searching for food in the sandy sea bottom. The behavior, known as sponging, has only been observed in this bay, and is almost exclusively shown by females. A study in 2005 concluded that mothers teach the behavior to their daughters, and <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> sponge-users are closely related, suggesting {{that it is a}} fairly recent innovation.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the third}} legend, Horodecki had cur it in 1913 (due to his {{inability}} to repay his creditors); all of the house's tenants would be either unhappy or would meet some sort of financial misfortune. There is a story <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> businesses who rented {{a portion of the}} building either went bankrupt, had their funds stolen or were disbanded.|$|E
5|$|An eighteen-issue monthly series, {{published}} between June 2003 and November 2004, follows U.S. Army communications specialist Patricia Robertson. During {{a supply}} run to an outpost {{owned by the}} Ararat Corporation, she discovers <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> scientists except one have been killed. The Ararat Corporation is run by an alien colony of miniature spider robots (led by an entity named Bob) that have infiltrated the U.S. government. The Ararat Corporation has cloned Venom to facilitate the extermination of humanity; however, the clone ravages its hosts and kills the outpost crew.|$|E

5|$|Anna Maria Luisa's {{single most}} {{enduring}} act was the Family Pact. It ensured <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Medicean art and treasures collected over nearly three centuries of political ascendancy remained in Florence. Cynthia Miller Lawrence, an American art-historian, argues that Anna Maria Luisa thus provisioned for Tuscany's future economy through tourism. Sixteen {{years after her}} death, the Uffizi Gallery, built by Cosimo the Great, {{the founder of the}} Grand Duchy, was made open to public viewing.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} though the {{chemical}} {{nature of what}} exactly in the blood conferred this protection was not known. In a few decades to follow, it was shown that the protective serum could neutralize and precipitate toxins, and clump bacteria. All these functions were attributed to different substances in the serum, and named accordingly as antitoxin, precipitin and agglutinin. <b>That</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> three substances were one entity (gamma globulins) was demonstrated by Elvin A. Kabat in 1939. In the preceding year Kabat had demonstrated the heterogeneity of antibodies through ultracentrifugation studies of horses' sera.|$|E
5|$|Bal Gangadhar Tilak has {{credited}} Jainism {{with the}} cessation of slaughter of animals in the brahamanical religion. Some scholars have traced the origin of Ahimsa to Jains and their precursor, the sramanas. According to Thomas McEvilley, a noted Indologist, certain seals of Indus Valley civilisation depict a meditative figure surrounded by a multitude of wild animals, providing evidence of proto yoga tradition in India akin to Jainism. This particular image might suggest <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> animals depicted are sacred to this particular practitioner. Consequently, these animals would be protected from harm.|$|E

5|$|Bamber {{arrived at}} the {{farmhouse}} one or two minutes after the police.

Police determined <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> doors and windows to the house were shut, except for {{the window in the}} main bedroom on the first floor. Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila. The only sound they reported from the house was a dog barking.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{faithful}} {{are obliged to}} attend Mass {{unless there is a}} grave impediment, pastors have the corresponding duty to offer everyone the real possibility of fulfilling the precept.... Yet more than a precept, the observance should be seen as a need rising from the depths of Christian life. It is crucially important <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> faithful should be convinced that they cannot live their faith or share fully {{in the life of the}} Christian community unless they take part regularly in the Sunday Eucharistic assembly.|$|E
5|$|Chambers {{claimed that}} his new coach had {{introduced}} him to Conte {{as a way of}} providing him with specialised 'nutritional supplements' - which he took by putting a few drops of liquid under his tongue. Conte had helped develop a type of anabolic steroid called THG, or tetrahydrogestrinone, at BALCO. After Chambers discovered that he had tested positive for drugs he sent his lawyer to meet Conte and make inquires about the supplement he had been ingesting. Conte assured him <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> substances were IAAF compliant.|$|E

5|$|Darmstadtium is {{the eighth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since copernicium (element 112) {{has been shown to}} be a transition metal, it is expected <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with darmstadtium as part of the platinum group metals and a noble metal. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue platinum, thus implying that darmstadtium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 10 elements, nickel, palladium, and platinum.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s and 1960s {{the college}} {{expanded}} through developments at Owengate and Bailey Court, both around Palace Green. In the 1970s, the college sold Lumley Castle. The proceeds {{were used to}} fund the development of Moatside Court, and meant <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> college's students were now housed within five minutes of the main castle.

5|$|Durran's costumes {{also helped}} emphasise social {{rank among the}} {{different}} characters; Caroline Bingley for instance is introduced in an empire silhouetted dress, clothing that would have then been {{at the height of}} fashion. During her interview, Durran opined <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> women wear white at the Netherfield Ball due to its contemporary popularity, an idea that Wright credits as his reason for hiring her. All of the costumes were handmade, as clothing was at the time. However, costumes and hairstyles were adjusted to appeal to contemporary audiences, sacrificing historical accuracy.|$|E
5|$|For {{scenes in}} the film that {{featured}} the moon in the background, a circle was drawn on a screen which was lit {{to make it look}} like the moon. Though having other lights were not possible, Bartley made sure <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> characters in such scenes had their shadows away from the moon. Despite this, many of the transformations of elements in this film were shown using dissolve techniques. No lights were hidden behind the painted moon, as a source for lighting.|$|E

However, Goebbels acceded to Harlan's insistence on rewriting the script and Harlan spent from November 1939 to March 1940 revising the script although he kept much of what Metzger and Möller had written.|$|E

5|$|In {{classical}} Pentecostalism, the baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{is understood to}} be a separate and distinct experience occurring sometime after regeneration. It is an empowering experience, equipping Spirit-filled believers for witness and ministry. Extending from this is the belief <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament are to be sought and exercised {{to build up the}} church. Pentecostals believe that Spirit baptism will be accompanied by the physical evidence of speaking in tongues (glossolalia).|$|E
