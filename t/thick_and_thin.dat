5|$|Calabozos and the {{majority}} of the Andean volcanoes formed from the subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate under the continental South American continental lithosphere. The caldera is in a transitional region between <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> lithosphere, and is probably supplied by a pool of andesitic and rhyolitic magma. It sits on a historic bed of volcanic and plutonic sedimentary rock (rock formed within the Earth) that in turn sits on top of a layer of merged sedimentary and metamorphic rock.|$|E

5|$|Calabozos lies in an {{area between}} <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> {{continental}} crust, and its eruptions are probably fed {{from a pool of}} andesitic and rhyolitic magma that sits just under its caldera. The caldera is underlain by a layer of volcaniclastic sedimentary rock from the Mesozoic era coalesced with intrusive and volcanic rocks of Tertiary age, over a layer of Precambrian-Triassic sedimentary and metamorphic rock formed from later plutons (magma intrusions). Under its northeast edge, Calabozos is cut by a north-south trending segment of sedimentary rock that includes gypsiferous and carbonates.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ehrhardt include an 'A' with gently curving bar matching the centre-link of the 'B', a wide 'T' with spreadeagled serifs {{on either side}} and a 'b' with no foot on the left. In italic the 'J' has a crossbar, the 'w' has sharp reverse curves towards the top and left, and the 'v' has a flourish on the left. The face has high stroke contrast (difference between <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> strokes) {{by the standards of}} most old-style serif fonts. In order to allow compact line spacing, descenders were kept reasonably short.|$|E
5|$|The Tale of Mr. Tod {{is longer}} than the typical Potter tale with 16 colour {{illustrations}} {{and a series of}} 42 black and white drawings, one illustration per page. The illustrations depict the wider landscape of Near Sawrey: Bull Banks, Oatmeal Crag, and Esthwaite Water. The interior of Mr. Tod's house provided the opportunity to present details of the interiors of village homes. In the frontispiece, Mr. Tod stands on a stone flag floor against a timber wall of muntin and plank construction (interlocking <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> vertical panels) covered with a sage-green limewash. A tea caddy, a silver salt, and blue and white willow china decorate his kitchen. The beehive-shaped brick oven was drawn from the one at the Sun Inn in Hawkshead and serves as a place for Brock to hide the bunnies. Emphatic frames in the black and white illustrations give the impression of woodcuts. Potter believed a black frame pulled a picture together and sent back the distance. Potter made the kitchen dim to eliminate some detail of the battle between Tod and Brock.|$|E

25|$|The {{theoretical}} {{index of}} hair bending stiffness is calculated using the <b>thickest</b> <b>and</b> <b>thinnest</b> axial diameters of human hair, and this index differs by race. The hair stiffness indexes of Mongoloids, Africans and Europeans are: 4.23, 2.75 and 1.59, respectively. This means that Mongoloids {{with the highest}} hair stiffness index value of 4.23 have the most rigid hair and Europeans with the lowest hair stiffness index value of 1.59 have the least rigid hair. The eccentricity of hair cross-sectional shape index is also calculated using the <b>thickest</b> <b>and</b> <b>thinnest</b> axial diameters of human hair, and this index also differs by race. The hair eccentricity indexes of Africans, Europeans and Mongoloids are: 1.74, 1.49 and 1.30, respectively. This means that Africans with the highest hair eccentricity index value of 1.74 have the curliest hair and Mongoloids with the lowest hair eccentricity index value of 1.30 have the least curly hair.|$|R

25|$|Old style type is {{characterized}} by a lack of large differences between <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> lines (low line contrast) and generally but less often by a diagonal stress (the thinnest parts of letters are at an angle rather than at the top and bottom). An old-style font normally has a left-inclining curve axis with weight stress at about 8 and 2 o'clock; serifs are almost always bracketed (they have curves connecting the serif to the stroke); head serifs are often angled.|$|E

40|$|International audienceEpitaxially grown {{thin films}} with nominal {{composition}} Ni 50 Mn 30 Ga 20 and thickness 1. 5 mu m were prepared on MgO(1 0 0) substrate with a Cr buffer layer by DC magnetron sputtering. The surface layer microstructures of the as-deposited thin films consist of non-modulated (NM) martensite plates with tetragonal structure at ambient temperature, {{which can be}} classified into the low and high relative contrast zones of clustered plates (i. e. plate colonies) with parallel or near-parallel inter-plate interface traces in secondary electron images. Orientation analyses by electron backscatter diffraction revealed that individual NM plates are composed of alternately distributed <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> <b>thinner</b> lamellar variants with (1 1 2) (Tetr) compound twin relationship and coherent interlamellar interfaces. In each plate colony, there are four distinct plates {{in terms of the}} crystallographic orientation of the <b>thicker</b> lamellar variants <b>and</b> therefore, in total, eight orientation variants. For the low relative contrast zones, both <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> <b>thinner</b> lamellar variants in adjacent plates are distributed symmetrically across their inter-plate interfaces (along the substrate edges). At the atomic level, there are no unbalanced interfacial misfits and height misfits, resulting in long and straight inter-plate interfaces with homogeneous contrast. However, in the high relative contrast zones, the <b>thicker</b> <b>and</b> <b>thinner</b> lamellar variants in adjacent plates are oriented asymmetrically across their inter-plate interfaces (at similar to 45 degrees to the substrate edges). Significant atomic misfits appear {{in the vicinity of the}} inter-plate interfaces and in the film normal direction. The former result in bending of the inter-plate interfaces, and the latter give rise to the high relative contrast between adjacent plates...|$|R
25|$|Display type {{refers to}} the use of type at large sizes, perhaps 30 points or larger. Some typefaces are {{considered}} useful solely at display sizes, and are known as display faces. Most effect typefaces are display types. Common features of display type include tighter default letter spacing, finer details and serifs, slightly more condensed letter shapes and larger differences between <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin</b> strokes; many of these are most visible in serif designs. Many display typefaces in the past such as those intended for posters and newspaper headlines were also only cut in capitals, since it was assumed lower-case would not be needed, or at least with no italics. This was true of many early sans-serif fonts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{a typical}} SAN {{solution}} consisting of intelligent storage system {{there will be}} many LUNs with pre-allocated space (thick LUNs) based on the business requirements. In case of thin provisioned LUNs physical space is not allocated upfront; space will be allocated on demand depending on incoming write workload. In thin provisioned LUN implementation some space will be anchored or pre-allocated and in other implementations no space will be anchored (everything is allocated on demand). Most often administrator oversubscribes the space for thick LUN’s. In case of thin LUN’s with anchored space some space will be reserved to accommodate data or incoming writes. There will be many oversubscribed <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> anchored <b>thin</b> LUNs in a storage systems resulting in non optimal usage of storage space. For some of the business needs oversubscribing space for <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> anchored <b>thin</b> LUN’s without considering the utilization doesn’t augur well. There should be a way to optimize storage space in an intelligent storage system based on LUN utilization over a period of time. By determining utilization of a LUN from time to time it’s possible to have dynamic provisioning mechanism for <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> anchored <b>thin</b> LUNs based on the usage over a time. The proposed policy driven <b>thick</b> <b>and</b> anchored <b>thin</b> LUN optimization will help storage admin to optimize space in a storage system...|$|R

500|$|Though the {{feathers}} are too dense to isolate a single structure for examination, {{several studies have}} suggested the presence of two distinct filament types (<b>thick</b> <b>and</b> <b>thin)</b> interspersed with each other. The thick filaments tend to appear 'stiffer' than thin filaments, and the thin filaments tend to lie {{parallel to each other}} but at angles to nearby thick filaments. These properties suggest that the individual feathers consisted of a central quill (rachis) with thinner barbs branching off from it, similar to but more primitive in structure than modern bird feathers. Overall, the filaments most closely resemble the [...] "plumules" [...] or down-like feathers of some modern birds, with a thick central quill and long, thin barbs. The same structures are seen in other fossils from the Yixian Formation, including Confuciusornis.|$|E

The eight corner ribs terminate six courses above the shaft, each corner rib resting on its neighboring corner rib via a miter joint, forming four corner arches. Each such arch supports a pair of square corner stones, one above the other totaling one course in height. Each corner rib is linked to the nearest center rib at the sixth course via a marble tie beam. The four center ribs terminate eight courses above the shaft at a marble cruciform (cross shaped) keystone, forming two main arches that cross each other. Two stones, each one course high, are mounted on each of the four ribs, supporting two additional courses above the cruciform keystone, leaving two courses to support the capstone's weight by themselves.|$|E
