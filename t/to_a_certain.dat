5|$|However, the boar and its {{relative}} the pig started {{being seen as}} polluting since the 12th century, due to Muslim influence on India. Muslims consider the pig and its meat unclean. This led {{to a decline in}} Varaha worship <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> extent.|$|E
50|$|In medicine, an {{indication}} is <b>a</b> valid reason <b>to</b> use <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> test, medication, procedure, or surgery.

5|$|Some {{agents are}} more {{specific}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> species. Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) occurs in pigs resulting in vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration.

5|$|Venom that is toxic only <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> taxon, or {{strongly}} toxic only <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> taxon, {{has been found}} in a number of snakes, suggesting that these venoms have evolved via natural selection to subdue preferred prey species. Examples of this phenomenon have been found in the Mangrove snake Boiga dendrophila, which has a venom specifically toxic to birds, {{as well as in the}} genera Echis and Sistrurus, and in sea snakes. However, while several snakes possess venom that is highly toxic to their preferred prey species, the reverse correlation is not necessarily true: the venoms of several snakes are toxic to taxa that they do not consume in high proportions. Most snake venom, for instance, is highly toxic to lizards, although the proportion of lizard prey varies among snake species. This has led researchers to suggest that toxicity <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> taxon is nearly independent of toxicity to another distantly related taxon.|$|E
5000|$|In medicine, a {{contraindication}} is {{a condition}} or factor that serves as <b>a</b> reason <b>to</b> withhold <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> medical treatment due to the harm that it would cause the patient.

40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} I {{distinguish}} {{the notion of}} there being something it is like <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> kind of creature from that of there being something it is like <b>to</b> have <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> kind of experience. Work on consciousness has typically dealt with the latter while employing {{the language of the}} former. I propose several ways of analyzing what it is like <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> kind of creature and find problems with them all. The upshot is that even if there is something it is like to have certain kinds of experience, it does not follow that there is anything it is like <b>to</b> be <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> kind of creature. Skepticism about the existence of something that it is like <b>to</b> be <b>an</b> F is recommended...|$|R

A person from Xizhou, a Tokharistani (i.e. Bactrian), and three Sogdians verified the sale of the girl.|$|E
5|$|A planet's {{defining}} {{physical characteristic}} {{is that it}} is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.|$|E
50|$|Finally, a Challenge mode {{has been}} added, where the player is given {{specific}} goals {{in order to}} proceed through stages.

5|$|Although {{atherosclerosis}} occurs <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> {{degree in}} all people, people with FH may develop accelerated atherosclerosis {{due to the}} excess level of LDL. The degree of atherosclerosis approximately depends {{on the number of}} LDL receptors still expressed and the functionality of these receptors. In many heterozygous forms of FH, the receptor function is only mildly impaired, and LDL levels will remain relatively low. In the more serious homozygous forms, the receptor is not expressed at all.|$|E
5|$|Before {{this the}} church had {{maintained}} {{a distance from the}} Armenian revolutionary groups as the latter saw the former as a conservative institution. It was Khrimian who welcomed revolutionary activism, especially by the Dashnaktsutyun, the most influential Armenian party. According to Panossian, Khrimian thus radicalised, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> degree, the Armenian Church and as such secularised in its vision of the Armenian nation.|$|E

5|$|Cluj-Napoca's salient {{architecture}} is primarily Renaissance, Baroque and Gothic. The modern era has also produced a remarkable set of buildings from the mid-century style. The mostly utilitarian Communist-era {{architecture is}} also present, although only <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> extent, as Cluj-Napoca never faced a large systematisation programme. Of late, {{the city has}} seen significant growth in contemporary structures such as skyscrapers and office buildings, mainly constructed after 2000.|$|E
5|$|During the Hellenistic period, mythology {{took on the}} {{prestige}} of elite knowledge that marks its possessors as belonging <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> class. At the same time, the skeptical turn of the Classical age became even more pronounced. Greek mythographer Euhemerus established the tradition of seeking an actual historical basis for mythical beings and events. Although his original work (Sacred Scriptures) is lost, much is known about it from what is recorded by Diodorus and Lactantius.|$|E

5|$|In 1632, Sigismund III Vasa, {{the king}} of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, died. Russia, having {{recovered}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> extent from the Time of Troubles, decided {{to capitalize on the}} temporary confusion of its western neighbor. Russia's aim was to gain control of Smolensk, which it had ceded to the Commonwealth in 1618 at the Truce of Deulino, ending the last Russo-Polish War. Smolensk was the capital of the Commonwealth's Smoleńsk Voivodeship, but it had often been contested, and it changed hands many times during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries (from the days of the Muscovite-Lithuanian Wars).|$|E
5|$|In the US Senate, however, {{a series}} of {{amendments}} exempted important issues from any sort of arbitration. Any issue that was not exempted would need a two thirds vote of the Senate before arbitration could begin. Virtually nothing {{was left of the}} original proposal, and the Senate in May 1897 voted 43 in favor to 26 opposed, three votes short of the two thirds majority needed. The Senate in the first place was jealous of its control over treaties, and secondly was susceptible <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> deep-rooted Anglophobia.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, a modern village (al-Mishrifeh) was built within the ancient site.
