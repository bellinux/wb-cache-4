5|$|Companies {{object to}} being blamed for shark bite incidents, {{pointing}} out that lightning tends to strike humans more often than sharks bite humans. Their position is that further research needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>before</b> banning practices such as chumming, which may alter natural behavior. One compromise is to only use chum in areas where whites actively patrol anyway, well away from human leisure areas. Also, responsible dive operators do not feed sharks. Only sharks {{that are willing to}} scavenge follow the chum trail and if they find no food at the end then the shark soon swims off and does not associate chum with a meal. It has been suggested that government licensing strategies may help enforce these responsible tourism.|$|E
5|$|Development {{was almost}} {{complete}} with only minor polishing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>before</b> {{the game was}} {{to be released in}} 2011. A playable demo of Duke Nukem Forever was released once Gearbox figured out the timing, with purchasers of the Game of the Year Edition of Borderlands gaining early access. The demo is unexpectedly different from the versions available at PAX and Firstlook. Those that purchased Borderlands on Valve's Steam prior to October 12, 2010 got the code for the demo without the need to buy the Game of the Year edition of the game. Duke Nukem Forever was initially scheduled for release on May 3 in the United States and May 6 internationally and after another delay was finally released on June 14 in North America and June 10 worldwide, nearly four weeks after the game had 'gone gold' within 15 years.|$|E

25|$|Cards acquire RHP {{reliever}} John Axford. The Cardinals acquired Milwaukee Brewers closer John Axford, 30, on August 30, {{in exchange}} for a player to be named later. No cash changed hands, leaving the Cardinals to pay Axford the approximately $1 mil. remaining on his $5 mil. 2013 contract. He is eligible for arbitration after the season, and the Cardinals can either non-tender him after the season or work out a new contract for him. He has not saved a game in 2013, and has a 4.45 ERA in 62 games. This is the first deal between the Cardinals and Brewers in 10 years. This is the first deal the Cardinals have done this season to add to the club, and needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>before</b> the August 31 deadline so Axford could be on the postseason roster.|$|E
25|$|The 5th Olympic Festival {{was again}} held at Llandudno on 25–26 June 1866. John Hulley {{followed}} this event by organising a swimming fete for juveniles {{at the same}} venue on 27 July 1866. During his stay at Llandudno he revisited his views concerning the modes of bathing attire for males and females. He addressed a large gathering on the Parade and spoke {{about the need for}} British holiday resorts to follow the lead of those on the continent in the matter of dress. His main theme was simply that there were two things <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>before</b> British bathing will be as decent, as moral, as enjoyable, as bathing on the continent. The first was to get men and women to wear decent bathing dresses; and the second was, to induce them to be in company. At the close of his address, discussion was invited, but, with the exception of two gentlemen who spoke in favour of Mr Hulley's views, no discussion was entered upon. The question was then put to the meeting whether the views advocated were such as met the approval of those present, and was carried unanimously. His speech was reported in the Pall Mall Gazette of 7 September 1866.|$|E

500|$|On {{the night}} of 30 September–1 October, seven units are sent to kidnap the generals {{associated}} with the Council. Nasution manages to escape over a wall, while his attaché Pierre Tendean comes running out, wielding a gun; Tendean is quickly captured and, when asked where Nasution is, confesses himself to be the general. Yani, who fights back, is killed in his home; Major General M. T. Haryono meets a similar fate. Chief Military Prosecutor Sutoyo Siswomiharjo, Major General Siswondo Parman, and Lieutenant General Soeprapto are captured. Brigadier General D. I. Pandjaitan goes willingly, but when he prays for too long before entering the truck he is killed. The bodies and prisoners are taken to the G30S/PKI camp in Lubang Buaya, where the survivors are tortured and killed. Their bodies are then thrown into a well. Later that morning, members of the movement take over the RRI office and force the staff there to read a speech by Untung (Bram Adrianto), which states that the G30S has moved to forestall a coup by the Generals' Council and announces {{the formation of a}} [...] "Revolutionary Council". Other G30S/PKI men go to the palace to secure the president but find that he has already left. At Halim, the president speaks with the G30S leaders and declares that he will take full control of the Army. Another radio speech is soon read, outlining the composition of the new Revolutionary Council and announcing changes to Army hierarchy.
