5|$|Morganstown {{is north}} of Radyr, {{on the other}} side of the M4 Motorway. Neighbouring {{communities}} are Whitchurch to the east on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank</b> of the River Taff, Pentyrch to the west with St Fagans and Llandaff to the south.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century Richmond and {{neighbouring}} Twickenham on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank</b> of the Thames, both {{of which}} were distant from London but enjoyed efficient transport links to the city via the river, became extremely fashionable, and their populations began to grow rapidly. As the ferry was unable to handle large loads and was often cancelled due to weather conditions, the river crossing became a major traffic bottleneck.|$|E
5|$|North of Short Street, NY9M curved {{back to the}} northwest, passing Smith Pond and {{traveling}} through woodlands as it approached Schroon Lake. It then crossed over {{the southern tip of}} the lake and entered the town of Chester on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank.</b> The route came to an end shortly afterward at a junction with US9 in the hamlet of Pottersville.|$|E
50|$|The Boones {{eventually}} {{settled on}} <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>banks</b> of <b>the</b> Yadkin River, {{which serves as}} a county line and into what is now Davie County, about two miles (3 km) west of Mocksville.|$|R
5000|$|Ebetsu station - An 11 km 762mm {{gauge line}} {{operated}} to Tobetsu, on the Sassho Line, although at each terminus the 762mm gauge stations were on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>banks</b> of <b>the</b> Ishikarigawa and Tobetsugawa rivers (respectively) to the JR stations.|$|R
5000|$|Between Washington and Pittsburgh, {{it mostly}} follows the {{historic}} B&O route along narrow river valleys {{hemmed in by}} steep slopes, including the upper Potomac, Youghiogheny, and Monongahela Rivers. Rail trails parallel much of this route, often on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>banks.</b> <b>The</b> route straightens and levels out from Ohio onward.|$|R
5|$|On <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank</b> of the Mississippi, {{a second}} {{simultaneous}} {{attack on the}} nearby former British colonial outpost of Cahokia, occupied by Patriot Virginians, was also repulsed. The retreating Indians destroyed the crops and took captive civilians outside the protected area. The British failed to defend {{their side of the}} river and, thus, effectively ended any attempts to gain control of the Mississippi River during the war.|$|E
5|$|Only one Horsa with {{a platoon}} of {{infantry}} from the Staffords landed near the bridge. Its commander, Lieutenant Withers, divided his men into two groups, one of which swam across the river and took up position on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank.</b> Thereafter the bridge was captured following a simultaneous assault from both sides. The Italian defenders from the 120th Coastal Infantry Regiment abandoned their pillboxes on the north bank.|$|E
5|$|David Livingstone, {{who visited}} Feira in 1856, {{described}} it as utterly ruined at that time, but still conspicuous by the ramshackle monastery buildings on the site. When Clark arrived about three decades later, the Portuguese still maintained a boma (fort) called Zumbo on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank</b> of the Luangwa, but the surrounding country, then called Mashukulumbwe, was largely wild, {{and out of the}} control of any government. Harrison Clark settled at Feira, initially alone. According to a letter he wrote in 1897, he flew the British Merchant Navy's Red Ensign flag over his house.|$|E
5000|$|The {{country of}} Mai {{is to the}} north of Borneo. The natives live in large villages on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>banks</b> of a stream and cover {{themselves}} with a cloth like a sheet or hide their bodies with a loin cloth. There are metal images of Buddhas of unknown origin scattered about in the tangled wilds[...]|$|R
5000|$|In 1225, the Zhu Fan Zhi {{noted that}} [...] "the country of Ma-i {{is to the}} north of Borneo" [...] and added that few pirates reach these shores. It also noted that [...] "the people of Ma-i live in large villages (literally [...] "settlements of more than a {{thousand}} households") on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>banks</b> of a stream." ...|$|R
60|$|As Rance prophesied, so {{it turned}} out. The Indians had got an {{unexpectedly}} severe repulse, {{and did not}} attempt to interfere with the travellers during the night, but in the morning they were found to have posted themselves on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>banks</b> of <b>the</b> stream, evidently with the intention of disputing the further progress of the party.|$|R
5|$|In Rochester, NY104 {{passes through}} an {{area known as}} Kodak Park, the large {{industrial}} complex owned by Eastman Kodak that occupies an entire neighborhood. In {{the middle of the}} complex, NY104 crosses the Rochester and Southern Railroad and the CSX Transportation-owned Charlotte Running Track and intersects the eastern terminus of NY18. Continuing east, NY104 crosses the Genesee River gorge on the Veterans Memorial Bridge. On <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank,</b> it loses the name West Ridge Road and becomes a limited-access highway known as the Keeler Street Expressway.|$|E
5|$|On <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank</b> of the river, Superior Avenue climbs a hill {{past the}} Evergreen Cemetery at the top. The section of roadway {{up to this}} point carries the highest levels of traffic as {{measured}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in their annual average daily traffic (AADT) surveys. Some 3,900vehicles used this segment of trunkline daily in 2007. Outside of town, the trunkline runs south of Runkle Lake through hilly, wooded terrain. The roadway crosses the southern section of the Michigamme River west of the Dickinson County line.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian Serb TO and JNA defences {{immediately}} west of {{the city}} of Sisak and north of Glina were positioned along the right (southern) bank of the Kupa River, largely consisting of the JNA 592nd and the 622nd Mechanised Brigades. On <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank,</b> the HV 100th Infantry Brigade held positions west of Sisak, flanked by the 145th Infantry Brigade to its right, and the 10th brigade of the Croatian TO further to the west. The planned main axis of the Operation Whirlwind extended across the 592nd Mechanised Brigade AOR, commanded by Colonel Boško Džombić.|$|E
50|$|In 1951 the {{northern}} part of the village was split from Staré Hamry and joined with Ostravice municipality, whereas southern part of Ostravice was split from it and joined with Staré Hamry, and so both municipalities now lie on both banks of the Ostravice river, as opposed to the previous situation when they were lying concurrently on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>banks</b> of <b>the</b> river.|$|R
5000|$|The {{town has}} a {{population}} of just over 5000 people. [...] Unusually for a small town in South Africa, Kenton is predominantly English-speaking, except for the suburb of Ekuphumleni, which {{has a population}} of around 3600 people and is exclusively Xhosa-speaking, the town is predominantly English-speaking. The village of Boesmansriviermond on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>banks</b> of <b>the</b> Bushman's River is predominantly Afrikaans-speaking.|$|R
50|$|On 9 July 1297, {{the nobles}} of Scotland {{gathered}} {{on the banks of}} a loch between Irvine and Bourtreehill House. They were prepared to go into battle against the approaching English forces and had made camp at Knadgerhill, {{on the north side of}} the loch. When the English arrived, they too camped on the side of the loch but on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>banks</b> to <b>the</b> south.|$|R
5|$|The German {{were forced}} to {{withdraw}} from the north of the Orne but Allied forces were unable to push beyond the Orne. German forces were dug-in on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank</b> in position to block a move south. Montgomery called off an advance beyond the Orne as further attacks would be too costly for the gains made, which had inflicted much attrition on the defenders. For French public opinion the operation was a coup; civilians now believed the liberation of France was truly under way.|$|E
5|$|The colonial {{administration}} {{wanted to}} expand its influence around the river, particularly because the inhabitants of Gorée were threatened with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise of the slave trade, and also because of their competition with Saint-Louis. On January 9, 1836, Lieutenant Malavois, {{who was in charge}} of Gorée, left for Casamance in search of a site for a trading post. The tip of Diogue, on the north shore, was first considered, but at the refusal of the Jola, it was <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank</b> which was eventually accepted.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{continued}} to hamper the 9th Division's advance. The 26th Brigade, further inland, remained {{stuck on the}} eastern side of the Busu. On 10 September, the commandos providing flank security managed to get across the Sankwep River, close to its confluence with the Busu, pushing a kunda bridge across. Shortly afterwards, they clashed with a small party of Japanese attempting to advance towards the bridge, and several Japanese were killed. To reinvigorate the 26th, engineer support was brought up. The 2/7th Field Company was pushing a jeep track forward with the help of the 2/48th, and they subsequently arrived with boats, ropes and cables, and several attempts were made to get across, all of which eventually failed as the engineers came under fire from <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank.</b> Heavy clashes later took place as the Australians and Japanese fought desperately in the swamp around the crossing. As it became uncertain whether the 26th would be able to force their way across, a company from the 2/48th was sent south to use the 24th Brigade's crossing and then advance north along the western bank of the Busu to help secure the brigade's beachhead when it finally did get across. on 13 September further engineer stores arrived, including bridging equipment and folding boats, and the following day a Small Box Girder bridge was pushed across despite heavy fire from <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank,</b> allowing the 26th Brigade to get across the Busu on 14 September.|$|E
50|$|Chapel Hill, on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> west <b>bank</b> of <b>the</b> Witham, {{falls within}} the {{drainage}} area of the Witham First District Internal Drainage Board.|$|R
50|$|On <b>the</b> <b>opposite,</b> {{north-eastern}} <b>banks</b> of <b>the</b> river lies Bufalo in Caprivi {{and the two}} {{towns are}} linked via a nearby border post.|$|R
5000|$|The {{village was}} {{administratively}} formed in 1956 through {{the merger of}} the villages of Grozdovo (until 1906 Burnusus, 1906-1947 Malko Borisovo) and Voynitsite (until 1906 Voynik Mahle), on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>banks</b> of <b>the</b> Omurovo River. Its name means [...] "Daskalovi Brothers" [...] and it was named after the brothers Dimitar, Ivan and Nikola, participants in the September Uprising who were executed by firing squad by the authorities on 4 October 1923.|$|R
5|$|At the Great Bitter Lake, the Egyptian 130th Amphibious Brigade {{performed}} its own crossing. Composed of the 602nd and 603rd Mechanized Infantry Battalions with 1,000 men, {{including a}} Sagger anti-tank battalion, an anti-air battalion, 20 PT-76 tanks and 100 amphibious armored personnel carriers, it was tasked with seeking and destroying enemy installations at the entrances of the Gedy and Mitla Passes. The sand rampart {{that lined the}} entire Suez Canal {{did not exist in}} the Bitter Lakes, and there were no Israeli defences or units to be encountered, and the brigade reached <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank</b> around 14:40 without any losses. The Egyptians discovered a minefield blocking their advance, and military engineers worked to clear a path.|$|E
5|$|Following training, the {{battalion}} was deployed to New Guinea, arriving in Milne Bay in early August 1943. It saw {{action in the}} final stages of the Salamaua–Lae campaign in September 1943. The 2/15 took part in the landing at Lae, the first amphibious operation undertaken by Australian forces since the failed Gallipoli campaign in 1915. During the operation, the 2/15th was initially assigned the task of securing the beachhead following the 20th Brigade's landing. After being relieved it joined the advance west towards the town, slowed by heavy rains that turned the many creeks in the area into raging torrents, which were invariably covered by heavy Japanese fire from <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank.</b>|$|E
5|$|Howell was out {{on patrol}} on 15 June 1918 when German and Austrian forces {{initiated}} the Battle of the Piave River by striking Allied lines on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank.</b> After landing back at base at 11:40, {{he was the first}} to bring news of the attack. With the aircraft refuelled and loaded with bombs, he—in company with the rest of the squadron—then led his flight on a total of four sorties against the enemy insurgents. No.45 Squadron succeeded in destroying with its bombs a pontoon bridge, a boat, and a trench filled with soldiers, before inflicting at least a hundred casualties with machine gun fire. Heavy rain washed other bridges away and by 18 June the stranded Austrian forces on the Allied bank of the river were routed by a counterattack.|$|E
60|$|The British {{posts in}} {{question}} were accordingly reconnoitred from <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>banks</b> of <b>the</b> Hudson, by Colonel Gouvion, an able French engineer. Preparations {{were made to}} carry the scheme into effect, should it be determined upon, when news was received of the unexpected and accidental appearance of several British armed vessels in the Hudson; the effect was to disconcert the plan and finally to cause it to be abandoned.|$|R
50|$|The Thames Path {{follows the}} western/southern bank to Clifton Hampden Bridge, where it crosses to <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> {{northern}} <b>bank</b> {{to continue to}} Clifton Lock.|$|R
60|$|The {{position}} {{was a strong}} one. The river was here divided into two branches and, {{on the point of}} land between these, the principal stockade was erected and was well provided with artillery; while on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>banks</b> of both rivers other stockades with guns were erected, so that any attack by water would be met by the direct fire from the great stockade, and a cross fire from those on the banks.|$|R
5|$|In 1819 Cardiff Cricket Club was formed, by 1848 {{they had}} moved to their new home at the Arms Park. Glamorgan Cricket Club, at the time not a {{first-class}} county, played their first match at Cardiff Arms Park in June 1869, against Monmouthshire Cricket Club. They played their first-ever County Championship match there in 1921, competing there every season (except while first-class cricket was suspended during the Second World War), their last match being against Somerset County Cricket Club in August 1966. Cardiff Cricket Club played their final game at the ground against Lydney Cricket Club on 17 September 1966. Both Cardiff Cricket Club and Glamorgan then {{moved to a new}} ground at Sophia Gardens on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank</b> of the River Taff to the Arms Park, following work on the creation of a national rugby stadium, later named the National Stadium.|$|E
5|$|On the {{opposite}} riverbank, the route turns eastward {{to follow the}} eastern bank of the Schroon River through an undeveloped portion of Warrensburg comprising little more than forests. The route winds along the bank of river to the hamlet of Warrensburg, where the route becomes River Street and heads past several blocks of houses. At Alden Avenue, the route curves to the northeast, mirroring the curvature of the river through Warrensburg. It continues along the waterway to the junction of Ridge and River Streets, where NY418 turns north onto Richards Avenue and finally crosses the river on a truss bridge. The route meets Water Street (CR9) on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank</b> before continuing northward past several commercial properties {{to the center of}} Warrensburg, where NY418 ends at an intersection with US9 (Main Street).|$|E
5|$|The French column, {{despite the}} harassment, {{managed to take}} control of the bridge and started to cross to <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>bank</b> of the Fluvià. The miquelets and armed peasants, however, fired on them from the south and killed up to 70 French soldiers. According to Charles Sévin, marquis de Quincy, a {{contemporary}} French artillery general and military historian of Louis XIV's reign, Juigné's corps was able to retreat to Olot in good order. On the other hand, the local 19th-century Catalan historian Esteve Paluzie i Cantalozella claimed that the French troops fled in disarray, leaving 150 prisoners to the Catalans, which they carried to Sant Esteve d'en Bas under a heavy escort.|$|E
50|$|The {{clearing}} of {{the vegetation}} on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>banks</b> immediately paid off as, upon reaching Palurte, Pacheco easily noticed {{a number of}} Calicut cannons being rolled into position, aiming to sink the anchored caravels. Duarte Pacheco ordered concentrated fire from the ships on their position, scattering the Calicut artillery crews. He then landed a Portuguese-Cochinese assault force on the beach, who rushed up to finish off the lingering Calicut crews and dragged away or spiked the abandoned Calicut cannons.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{office towers}} at Raffles Place {{on the south}} bank of the Singapore River serve as a {{backdrop}} against Sir Stamford Raffles' statue located at Raffles' Landing Site on <b>the</b> river's <b>opposite</b> <b>bank.</b>|$|R
50|$|Its {{territory}} is mildly hilly {{and is the}} south-end part of a hilly region called Zselic. Somogyapáti and Adorjánpuszta, both situated on hilltops, are on <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>banks</b> of <b>the</b> creek Keleti-Gyöngyös. In the 1960s a dam have been built to impound this creek for irrigation purposes, creating a 105-hectare (259-acre) artificial lake of which area partly belongs to Somogyviszló. Its original cubic capacity was 2.3 hm³ with the average depth being 2.2 metre (7.2 foot). The lake serves as a fishpond nowadays.|$|R
