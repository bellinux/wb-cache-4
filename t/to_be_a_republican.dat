5|$|I've had to {{deal with}} some hard truths... People don't like to hear we've got only 18 percent of the electorate. They pretend it's not {{important}} that our following among blacks, and young people, and urban communities is not what it should be... But I feel it's of the greatest importance that if there's <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, we look these facts in the face.|$|E
5|$|Agnew {{made his}} first bid for {{political}} office in 1956, when he sought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> candidate for Baltimore County Council. He was turned down by local party leaders, but nevertheless campaigned vigorously for the Republican ticket. The election resulted in an unexpected Republican majority on the council, and in recognition for his party work, Agnew was appointed for a one-year term to the county Zoning Board of Appeals, at a salary of $3,600 per year. This quasi-judicial post provided an important supplement to his legal practice, and Agnew welcomed the prestige connected with the appointment. In April 1958 he was reappointed to the Board for a full three-year term, and became its chairman.|$|E

25|$|Price is {{the sponsor}} of the Empowering Patients First Act (EPFA), which he first {{introduced}} in the 111th Congress and has reintroduced in each Congress since then. Originally intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> alternative to Democratic efforts to reform the health care system, it has since been positioned by Price and other Republicans as a potential replacement to the ACA. The bill, among other things, creates and expands tax credits for purchasing health insurance, allows for some interstate health insurance markets, and reforms medical malpractice lawsuits.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} in Rossio, with the pouring {{of the populace}} into the streets, was very confusing but advantageous to the republicans, given the obvious public support. Machado Santos spoke to General Gorjão Henriques and invited him to keep the role of commandant of the division, but he refused. António Carvalhal, known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>republican</b> sympathiser, then received command. Soon afterwards, at 9 o'clock in the morning, the Republic was proclaimed by José Relvas from the balcony of the Paços do Concelho. A provisional government was then nominated, presided {{by members of the}} Portuguese Republican Party, with the purpose to govern the nation until a new constitution was approved.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt's plan to {{convince}} Hoover {{to run for}} the Democratic nomination fell through after Hoover publicly declared himself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican,</b> but Roosevelt nonetheless decided to seek the 1920 vice presidential nomination. After Governor James M. Cox of Ohio won the party's presidential nomination, he chose Roosevelt as his running mate, and the party formally nominated Roosevelt by acclamation. Although his nomination surprised most people, Roosevelt was considered as bringing balance to the ticket as a moderate, a Wilsonian, and a prohibitionist with a famous name. Roosevelt had just turned 38, four years younger than Theodore had been when he received the same nomination from his party. Roosevelt resigned as Assistant Secretary of the Navy after the Democratic convention and campaigned across the nation for the Cox–Roosevelt ticket.|$|E
25|$|Indiana {{has long}} been {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> stronghold, particularly in Presidential races. The Cook Partisan Voting Index (CPVI) now rates Indiana as R+9. Indiana {{was one of only}} ten states to support Republican Wendell Willkie in 1940. On 14 occasions has the Republican candidate defeated the Democrat by a double digit margin in the state, including six times where a Republican won the state by more than 20%. In 2000and 2004 George W. Bush won the state by a wide margin while the election was much closer overall. The state has only supported a Democrat for president five times since 1900. In 1912, Woodrow Wilson became the first Democrat to win the state with 43% of the vote. Twentyyears later, Franklin D. Roosevelt won the state with 55% of the vote over incumbent Republican Herbert Hoover. Roosevelt won the state again in 1936. In 1964, 56% of voters supported Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson over Republican Barry Goldwater. Forty-fouryears later, Democrat Barack Obama narrowly won the state against John McCain 50% to 49%. In the following election, Republican Mitt Romney won back the state for the Republican party with 54% of the vote over the incumbent President Obama who won 43%.|$|E

[...] Reagan had succeeded Murphy as SAG president where he worked as an informant for the FBI during the Hollywood blacklist period. [...] Two decades later, Reagan also ran for office and became California's governor.|$|E
500|$|Johnson.....was {{all over}} the Cerro Grande Fire last week. He helped reporters {{understand}} where the fire was headed when low-level Forest Service officials couldn't, ran herd over the bureaucratic process of getting {{state and federal agencies}} and the National Guard involved, and even helped put out some of the fire with his feet. On a tour of Los Alamos last Wednesday, when he saw small flames spreading across a lawn, he had his driver stop his car. He jumped out and stomped on the flames, as did his wife and some of his staffers. [...] Johnson's leadership during the fire was praised by Democratic Congressman Tom Udall, who said: [...] "I think the real test of leadership is when you have circumstances like this. He's called on his reserves of energy and has just been a really excellent leader under very difficult circumstances here." [...] Johnson rebuffed efforts by the Libertarian Party to draft him in the 2000 presidential election, stating himself <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> with no interest in running for president.|$|E

2500|$|The {{district}} {{is one of}} the most Republican districts in the nation. [...] Democrats have only come close to winning this district twice as currently drawn, in 1974 and 2006; and Republican presidential and gubernatorial candidates routinely carry the district with margins of 40 percent or more. [...] Although Nebraska's state legislature is elected on a nonpartisan basis, all but one state senator representing a significant portion of the {{district is}} known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican.</b> With a Cook PVI of R+27, it is the most Republican Congressional District in the country outside the South.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis' {{investigation}} {{began to}} shape up as an air mail contract scandal. Lewis was having difficulty impressing his findings on government officials until he approached Alabama Senator Hugo Black [...] Black {{was the chairman of}} a special committee established to investigate ocean mail contracts awarded by the federal government to the merchant marine. Interstate Commerce Commission investigators seized records from all the mail carriers on September 28, 1933, [...] and brought about public awareness of what became known as [...] "the Black Committee." [...] The special Senate committee investigated alleged improprieties and gaming of the rate structure, such as carriers padlocking individual pieces of mail to increase weight. Despite showings that Brown's administration of the air mail had increased the efficiency of the service and lowered its costs from $1.10 to $0.54 per mile, and the obvious partisan politics involved in investigating what appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> scandal involving Herbert Hoover by a Democratic-controlled committee, the hearings raised serious questions regarding its legality and ethics.|$|E
2500|$|Possibly {{the most}} famous of the Muntz family was the {{inventor}} of Muntz metal, George Frederic Muntz, who was also an early Member of Parliament for Birmingham. He was a supporter of political reform and {{a founding member of the}} Birmingham Political Union along with Thomas Attwood. In his actions that led to the Reform Act 1832 Muntz was indicted for sedition as he tried to undermine the Duke of Wellington with a run on gold – To stop the Duke, run for Gold. He also was involved in a riot at St Martin's in Birmingham in protest against the Church Rates which were levied at around 6d to 9d in the pound. He was sent to trial in 1838 but was acquitted on all but one of 13 charges. Whilst claiming <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican,</b> his true character appeared to be that of an egotistical aristocrat. E. Edwards wrote in 1877 in the Birmingham Daily Mail of a conversation about a speech he made: [...] "They won't be able to print Muntz's speech verbatim." [...] "Why not?" [...] said I. [...] "Why my dear fellow, no printing office in the world would have capital I's enough." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{focused on}} his {{opposition}} to abortion and gun control, {{as well as his}} support for lower taxes and free-market health care solutions. [...] He told the CPAC audience that he arrived in Washington as [...] "a foot soldier in the Reagan Revolution", and addressed the issue of illegal immigration - one of the major issues where conservatives have attacked McCain. He said that [...] "it would be among my highest priorities to secure our borders first", before addressing other immigration laws. [...] Mike Huckabee spoke to CPAC two days later and said, [...] "I know that there was some speculation that I might come here today to announce that I would be getting out of the race. But I {{want to make sure you}} understand. Am I quitting? Well, let's get that settled right now. No, I'm not. And the reason is simple—I never learned arithmetic. You see folks, while I didn't get a college degree in mathematics and writing, I majored in miracles. Mathematically impossible miracles. It is because I go back to that which helped crystallize in me a conservative viewpoint as a teenager when it wasn't easy or popular <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> or a conservative in my hometown, because I do believe that America is about making choices, not simply echoing that of others. Let others join the [...] "Me, too" [...] crowd. But I didn't get where I am today and I didn't fight the battles in a state that, when I became its governor, was 90 percent Democrat, by simply echoing the voices of others. I did it by staking out a choice, stating that choice, making that choice and fighting for that choice, to believe that some things were right, some things were wrong, and it's better to be right and even to not win than it is to be wrong and to be a part of the crowd." ...|$|E
