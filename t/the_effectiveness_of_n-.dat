40|$|Many {{data support}} the {{beneficial}} effect of n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) as chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic {{agents in the}} treatment of several chronic pathologies including cancer. Different molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain their effects, including alterations in arachidonic acid oxidative metabolism and metabolic conversion of n- 3 PUFAs to novel discovered bioactive derivatives; modification of oxidative stress; changes in cell membrane fluidity and structure and altered metabolism and function of membrane proteins. Considerable knowledge has been recently gathered on the possible beneficial effects of n- 3 PUFAs administered in combination with different antineoplastic drugs and radiotherapy against melanoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, and colon, breast, prostate, and lung cancer. The efficacy of these combinations has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro, and clinical trials have also been conducted. The aim of this review is to analyze all the n- 3 PUFA combinations investigated so far, their efficacy, and the possible molecular mechanisms involved. It would be highly auspicable that the detailed analysis of the literature in this field could further support the common use of n- 3 PUFAs in combination with other chemopreventive agents and warrant more clinical investigations designed to test <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>n-</b> 3 PUFA treatments coupled with conventional antineoplastic therapie...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} limited {{research}} to date into methods for increasing people’s intentions to use omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n- 3 PUFA), which have been linked with decreased risk of suffering from numerous major diseases. The present study employed a cross-sectional design with 380 university students, employees, and visitors to investigate {{the efficacy of the}} protection motivation (PM) theory and the ordered protection motivation (OPM) theory, to predict behavioral intention to consume omega- 3 rich foods and dietary supplements. Analysis of model fit indicated that both the PMmodel and the OPM model adequately represented the structural relationships between the cognitive variables and intention to consume n- 3 PUFA. Further evaluation of relative fit of the two competing models suggested that thePMmodel might provide a better representation of decision-making following evaluation of the health threat of n- 3 PUFA deficiency. Path analysis indicated that the component of coping appraisal was significantly associated with the behavioral intention to consume n- 3 PUFA. Threat appraisal was found to be significantly associated with behavioral intention to consume n- 3 PUFAonly for theOPM model. Overall, the findings contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the roles that cognitive appraisal processes play in young and healthy individuals’ protective health decision-making regarding consumption of n- 3 PUFA. Implications of the findings and recommendations, which include (a) encouraging the consumption of n- 3 PUFA as an effective barrier against the incidence of disease, and (b) effectivehealth messaging that focuses on beliefs about <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>n-</b> 3 PUFA in reducing health risks, are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold: on the one hand, to confirm the {{positive}} results on n- 3 PUFA from the overall results Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nellInfarto Miocardi-co (GlSSI) -Prevenzione trial; on the other, to sum-marize and describe how the results of an important trial can help generate hypotheses either on mecha-nisms of action or on differential results in particular subgroups of patients, as well as test the pathophys-iological hypotheses that have accompanied in the years the story of the hypothesized mechanisms of action of a drug. GISSI-Prevenzione was conceived as a pragmatic population trial on patients with re-cent myocardial infarction and it was conducted in the framework of the Italian public health system. In GISSI-Prevenzione, 11, 323 patients were enrolled in a clinical trial aimed at testing <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>n-</b> 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and vitamin E. Patients were invited to follow Mediterranean dietary habits, and were treated with up-to-date preventive pharmacological interventions. Long-term n- 3 PUFA at 1 g daily, but not vitamin E at 300 mg daily, was beneficial for death and for combined death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and stroke. All the ben-efit, however, was attributable to the decrease in risk for overall () 20 %), cardiovascular () 30 %), and sud-den death () 45 %). At variance from the orientation of a scientific scenario largely dominated by the ‘‘cholesterol-heart hypothesis’’, GISSI-Prevenzione results indicate n- 3 PUFA (virtually devoid of any cholesterol-lowering effect) as a relevant pharmaco-logical treatment for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There is a {{need for}} female-controlled methods of HIV prevention. Vaginal microbicides, {{substances}} inserted into the vagina to prevent women acquiring HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) from men, could be useful in this regard. One potential vaginal microbicide is the widely used spermicide, nonoxynol- 9 (N- 9). OBJECTIVES: To determine <b>the</b> safety and <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>N-</b> 9 in preventing vaginal acquisition of HIV infection by women from men. SEARCH STRATEGY: Extensive searches of electronic databases, conference abstracts, reference lists of relevant studies and contact with experts and funders. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials meeting pre-determined quality criteria with HIV infection as the outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by the another. Any discrepancies were adjudicated by a third reviewer. MAIN RESULTS: Five trials were included in the review and four contributed to a meta-analysis. Overall, the risk of HIV infection was not statistically significantly different among women receiving N- 9 (relative risk [RR] 1. 12, 95 % CI 0. 88 - 1. 42; p= 0. 4). The risk of genital lesions was statistically significantly greater among women receiving N- 9 (RR 1. 18, 95 %CI 1. 02 - 1. 36; p= 0. 02). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that nonoxynol- 9 protects against vaginal acquisition of HIV infection by women from men.

STIs and RTIs are associated with the vaginal transmission of HIV. Additional strategies to improve STI control are needed, and vaginal microbicides are a possible strategy. One potential vaginal microbicide is the widely used spermicide, nonoxynol- 9 (N- 9). OBJECTIVES: To determine <b>the</b> safety and <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>N-</b> 9 in preventing vaginal acquisition of sexual transmitted infections (exclusive of HIV) by women from men. SEARCH STRATEGY: Systematic search of electronic databases, conference abstracts, reference lists of relevant studies and contact with experts and funders. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials meeting pre-determined quality criteria with STI as the outcome. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked by another. MAIN RESULTS: Ten of 12 identified randomised controlled trials were included and findings among them were broadly consistent. In meta-analysis, the risks of gonorrhoea (relative risk [RR] 0. 91, 95 %CI 0. 67 - 1. 24), cervical infection (RR 1. 01, 0. 84 - 1. 22), trichomoniasis (RR 0. 84, 0. 69 - 1. 02), bacterial vaginosis (0. 88, 0. 74 - 1. 04), chlamydia (RR 0. 88, 0. 77 - 1. 01) and candidiasis (RR 0. 97, 0. 84 - 1. 12) were not statistically significantly different in women receiving N- 9 compared with placebo. Genital lesions were more common in the N- 9 users (RR 1. 17, 95 %CI 1. 02 - 1. 35). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is good evidence that nonoxynol- 9 does not protect against sexually transmitted infections, and {{there is some evidence that}} it may be harmful by increasing the rate of genital ulceration.

40|$|Background: Patients {{who survive}} an acute {{myocardial}} infarction (MI) are at {{an increased risk of}} subsequent major cardiovascular events and (often sudden) cardiac death. The use of highly concentrated and purified omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n- 3 PUFAs), in addition to standard secondary prevention after MI, results in a significant reduction in the risk of sudden death versus no n- 3 PUFAs. This study assessed <b>the</b> cost <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> adding <b>n-</b> 3 PUFAs to the current secondary prevention treatment versus standard prevention alone after acute MI in five countries: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Germany and Poland. Methods: Based on the clinical outcomes of GISSI-P (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardico - Prevenzione) [MI, stroke, revascularisation rate and mortality], a decision model was built in DataPro(TM). The implications <b>of</b> adding <b>n-</b> 3 PUFAs to standard treatment in patients aged 59 years with a recent history of MI were analysed from the healthcare payer's perspective. The time horizon was 3. 5 years (identical to GISSI-Prevenzione) but the effects on life expectancy through avoidance of cardiac events were calculated lifelong. Event costs were based on literature data. Life expectancy data for survivors of cardiac disease were taken from the Saskatchewan database and then adjusted by country. Results are expressed as extra cost (_) per life-year gained (LYG). Annual discounting of 5 % was applied to health effects and costs. Results: Treatment with highly concentrated n- 3 PUFAs yielded between 0. 261 (Poland) and 0. 284 (Australia) LYG, at an additional cost of _ 787 (Canada) to _ 1439 (Belgium). The ICER varied between _ 2788 (Canada) and _ 5097 (Belgium) per LYG. Sensitivity analyses on <b>effectiveness,</b> cost <b>of</b> complications and discounting proved the robustness of the results. A second-order Monte Carlo simulation based on the 95 % confidence intervals obtained from GISSI-P suggests that highly concentrated n- 3 PUFAs are cost effective in 93 % of simulations in Poland and in > 98 % of simulations in the other countries, assuming the country-specific societal willingness-to-pay threshold. Total costs were considerably increased by including healthcare costs incurred during the remaining life-years, but this had no impact on the ICER-based treatment recommendation. Conclusions: Adding highly concentrated n- 3 PUFAs to standard treatment in the secondary prevention of MI appears to be cost effective versus standard treatment alone in the five countries studied.

The article analyzes the basic problems <b>of</b> evaluation <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> civil service modernization and scientific papers on these issues. The basic theoretical approaches {{to the definition of}} «assessment» and «evaluation» are studied. Existing theoretical and methodological approaches to the assessment process are analyzed and summarized, the main methods <b>of</b> evaluating <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil service modernization and the most common assessment methods are defined. Eligible for evaluating <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> civil service modernization are special analytical techniques: functional review, Balanced Scorecard, taxonomic analysis, Key Performance Indicators, methods of multivariate analysis and others. Among the methods of studying consumer expectations about <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil service modernization such ones are singled out: questionnaires, surveys, interviews, testing, monitoring, analysis of statistical sources, contents of documents, reports and regulatory framework and others. The methods of improving efficiency include: benchmarking, reengineering, performance assessment models and more. The importance of gradual replacement of cost evaluation methods by the results evaluation method is determined. It was shown the need for a comprehensive balanced scorecard to evaluate. With a view to the mutual agreement of principles, mechanisms and instruments for evaluating <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> civil service modernization the expediency of a systematic, targeted, synergistic, process, situational, strategic and resource approaches is grounded. Development of theoretical concepts and methodological principles <b>of</b> evaluating <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> civil service modernization should be based on the harmonious combination (integration) of all these approaches to modernization. Among the models of evaluation of efficiency such ones are studied: the essential, economic and professional models, model CAF, the process model etc. The basic components of evaluation models are analyzed. The basic stages <b>of</b> evaluating <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> civil service modernization are characterized. The ways of improvement of methodological approaches to control <b>the</b> evaluation <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> are determined, based on what the model <b>of</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> civil service modernization is proposed.
