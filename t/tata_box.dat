25|$|Pol II-transcribed genes {{contain a}} {{region in the}} {{immediate}} vicinity of the transcription start site (TSS) that binds and positions the preinitiation complex. This region is called the core promoter because of its essential role in transcription initiation. Different classes of sequence elements are found in the promoters. For example, the <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> is the highly conserved DNA recognition sequence for the <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> binding protein, TBP, whose binding initiates transcription complex assembly at many genes.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the polymerase complex takes place on the gene promoter. The <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> is one well-studied example of a promoter element that occurs in approximately 10% of genes. It is conserved in many (though not all) model eukaryotes and is found in {{a fraction of the}} promoters in these organisms. The sequence TATA (or variations) is located at approximately 25 nucleotides upstream of the Transcription Start Point (TSP). In addition, there are also some weakly conserved features including the TFIIB-Recognition Element (BRE), approximately 5 nucleotides upstream (BREu) and 5 nucleotides downstream (BREd) of the <b>TATA</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
25|$|Eukaryotic SRP RNAs are {{transcribed}} from DNA by RNA polymerase III (Pol III). RNA polymerase III also transcribes {{the genes}} for 5S ribosomal RNA, tRNA, 7SK RNA, and U6 spliceosomal RNA. The promoters {{of the human}} SRP RNA genes include elements located downstream of the transcriptional start site. Plant SRP RNA promoters contain an upstream stimulatory element (USE) and a <b>TATA</b> <b>box.</b> Yeast SRP RNA genes have a <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> and additional intragenic promoter sequences (referred to as A- and B-blocks) which {{play a role in}} regulating transcription of the SRP gene by Pol III. In the bacteria, genes are organized in operons and transcribed by RNA polymerase. The 5'-end of the small (4.5S) SRP RNA of many bacteria is cleaved by RNase P. The ends of the Bacillus subtilis SRP RNA are processed by RNase III. So far, no SRP RNA introns have been observed.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{sequence}} characteristics {{have been}} observed in bidirectional promoters, including a lack of <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes,</b> an abundance of CpG islands, and a symmetry around the midpoint of dominant Cs and As {{on one side and}} Gs and Ts on the other. CCAAT boxes are common, as they are in many promoters that lack <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes.</b> In addition, the motifs NRF-1, GABPA, YY1, and ACTACAnnTCCC are represented in bidirectional promoters at significantly higher rates than in unidirectional promoters. The absence of <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> in bidirectional promotors suggests that <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> play a role in determining the directionality of promoters, but counterexamples of bidirectional promoters do possess <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> and unidirectional promoters without them indicates that they cannot be the only factor.|$|R
40|$|TBP recognizes {{its target}} sites, <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes,</b> by {{recognizing}} their sequence-dependent structure and flexibility. Studying {{this mode of}} TATA-box recognition, termed ‘indirect readout’, is important for elucidating the binding mechanism in this system, {{as well as for}} developing methods to locate new binding sites in genomic DNA. We determined the binding stability and TBP-induced TATA-box bending for consensus-like <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes.</b> In addition, we calculated the individual information score of all studied sequences. We show that various non-additive effects exist in <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes,</b> dependent on their structural properties. By several criterions, we divide <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> to two main groups. The first group contains sequences with 3 – 4 consecutive adenines. Sequences in this group have a rigid context-independent cooperative structure, best described by a nearest-neighbor non-additive model. Sequences in the second group have a flexible, context-dependent conformation, which cannot be described by an additive model or by a nearest-neighbor non-additive model. Classifying <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> by these and other structural rules clarifies the different recognition pathways and binding mechanisms used by TBP upon binding to different <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes.</b> We discuss the structural and evolutionary sources of the difficulties in predicting new binding sites by probabilistic weight-matrix methods for proteins in which indirect readout is dominant...|$|R
30|$|Putative <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> were {{identified}} using the program “OPROF” ([URL] [6].|$|R
25|$|The CYR61 {{promoter}} is a <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> containing promoter, with binding {{sites for}} many transcription factors including AP1, ATF, E2F, HNF3b, NF1, NFκB, SP1, and SRF, and 2 poly(CA) stretches that may form Z-DNA structure. Transcriptional activation of CYR61 is exquisitely sensitive {{to a wide}} range of environmental perturbations, including stimulation by platelet-derived growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), growth hormone, the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), cAMP, vitamin D3, estrogen and tamoxifen, angiotensin II, hypoxia, UV light, and mechanical stretch.|$|E
25|$|The TATA-box binding protein (TBP) is {{required}} for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerases I, II and III, from promoters with or without a <b>TATA</b> <b>box.</b> In the presence of a TATA-less promoter, TBP binds with the help of TBP-associated factors (TAFs). TBP associates with a host of factors, including the general transcription factors TFIIA, -B, -D, -E, and -H, to form huge multi-subunit pre-initiation complexes on the core promoter. Through its association with different transcription factors, TBP can initiate transcription from different RNA polymerases. There are several related TBPs, including TBP-like (TBPL) proteins.|$|E
25|$|When TBP binds to a <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> {{within the}} DNA, it distorts the DNA by {{inserting}} amino acid side-chains between base pairs, partially unwinding the helix, and doubly kinking it. The distortion is accomplished through {{a great amount}} of surface contact between the protein and DNA. TBP binds with the negatively charged phosphates in the DNA backbone through positively charged lysine and arginine amino acid residues. The sharp bend in the DNA is produced through projection of four bulky phenylalanine residues into the minor groove. As the DNA bends, its contact with TBP increases, thus enhancing the DNA-protein interaction.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{to further}} analyze the {{function}} of the polyoma enhancer in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we use as reporter-genes derivatives of the yeast HIS 3 gene flanked by two types of partially deleted promoters: in one, UAS elements are removed by deletion of sequences upstream of nt - 80 (pGM 3181) in the second both <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> and UAS elements are removed by deletion of sequences upstream of nt - 35 (pGM 2809). These constructs have been studied both as free plasmids and after integration at the TRP 1 chromosomal locus. We find that in general the polyoma holoenhancer (A + B domains) elicits transcription from the physiological HIS 3 RNA start sites when the native <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> are present. In contrast, an altered enhancer B-domain from polyoma mutant Py-B 78, although active when inserted downstream of the test-gene or when coupled to a pseudopromoter (Ciaramella et al, accompanying manuscript), does not work properly in concert with the native yeast <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes.</b> We describe experiments that suggest an important role for the foreign enhancer in RNA start-site selection in yeast...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} search of DNA {{conformational}} features significant for functional sites is developed. The method uses helical angles averaged for known X-ray structures. Nucleotide sequences are assigned mean angles {{in a given}} region. Choice of the significant angles is based on their capabilities to discriminate functional sites from random sequences. The yeast, invertebrate and vertebrate <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> are analyzed using this method. Regions neighboring the <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> are found to have smaller helical twist and roll angles. The results agree with the experimental data on Dickerson-Drew dodecamers. There is {{a significant decrease in}} the length of a small roll angle region with increasing complexity of taxon organization. 1...|$|R
50|$|The genome is ~2.6 kilobases {{in length}} and encodes two open reading frames (ORFs). The larger of the ORFs encodes the {{replicase}} gene and the other the putative capsid protein. A stem-loop and <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> {{are present in the}} non coding parts of the sequence.|$|R
25|$|The {{transcription}} {{initiation site}} of the CD36 gene has been mapped to 289 nucleotides upstream from the translational start codon and a <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> and several putative cis regulatory regions lie further 5'. A binding site for PEBP2/CBF factors has been identified between -158 and -90 and disruption of this site reduces expression. The gene is the transcriptional control of the nuclear receptor PPAR/RXR heterodimer (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor – Retinoid X receptor) and gene expression can be up regulated using synthetic and natural ligands for PPAR and RXR, including the thiazolidinedione class of anti-diabetic drugs and the vitamin A metabolite 9-cis-retinoic acid respectively.|$|E
25|$|TBP is a subunit of the {{eukaryotic}} {{transcription factor}} TFIID. TFIID {{is the first}} protein to bind to DNA during {{the formation of the}} pre-initiation transcription complex of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II). Binding of TFIID to the <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> in the promoter region of the gene initiates the recruitment of other factors required for RNA Pol II to begin transcription. Some of the other recruited transcription factors include TFIIA, TFIIB, and TFIIF. Each of these transcription factors is formed from the interaction of many protein subunits, indicating that transcription is a heavily regulated process.|$|E
25|$|The {{promoter}} {{region for}} CCDC142 was identified using the El Dorado program at Genomatix, it spans bases 74482896–74483908 in chromosome 2. This 1013bp region spans 1071–58bp upstream {{of the start}} codon of CCDC142. There is a region in the promoter which binds {{a large number of}} Krueppel-like transcription factors and BED zinc-finger proteins. This region has no single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in it. Many of the transcription factors that bind to the promoter region of CCDC142 have functions dealing with tumor suppression, neurogenesis, DNA damage, and photoreception. This promoter region also contains a mammalian C-type LTR <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> which overlaps with the transcription start site of the gene.|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{studies of}} the β-phaseolin (phas) gene in {{transgenic}} tobacco have shown that it is highly active during seed embryogenesis but is completely silent in leaf and other vegetative tissues. In vivo footprinting revealed {{that the lack of}} even basal transcriptional activity in vegetative tissues is associated with the presence of a nucleosome that is rotationally positioned with base pair precision over three phased <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> present in the phas promoter. Positioning is sequence-dependent because an identical rotational setting is obtained upon nucleosome reconstitution in vitro. A comparison of DNase I and dimethyl sulfate footprints in vivo and in vitro strongly suggests that this repressive chromatin architecture is remodeled concomitant with gene activation in the developing seed. This leads to the disruption of histone-mediated DNA wrapping and the assembly of the <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> into a transcriptionally competent nucleoprotein complex...|$|R
40|$|The {{promoter}} {{region of}} the human parathyroid hormone gene was fused to the Escherichia coli neo gene and introduced into GH 4 C 1 rat pituitary and human HeLa cells. Both <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> of the human parathyroid hormone gene accurately directed transcription in GH 4 C 1 cells; the parathyroid hormone promoter was inactive in HeLa cells...|$|R
5000|$|The {{promoter}} region {{contains a}} number of transcription factors. [...] Those with high scores include estrogen response elements, <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes,</b> glucocoticoid response elements, and Ccaat/enchancer binding proteins. Experimental data reveals that FAM63A expression decreases when the estrogen receptor is not present, suggesting that the estrogen response elements may serve as an important promoter regulatory mechanism for this protein.|$|R
500|$|Flanking {{the open}} reading frame, genes contain a {{regulatory}} sequence {{that is required}} for their expression. First, genes require a promoter sequence. The promoter is recognized and bound by transcription factors and RNA polymerase to initiate transcription. The recognition typically occurs as a consensus sequence like the <b>TATA</b> <b>box.</b> [...] A gene can {{have more than one}} promoter, resulting in messenger RNAs (mRNA) that differ in how far they extend in the 5'end. Highly transcribed genes have [...] "strong" [...] promoter sequences that form strong associations with transcription factors, thereby initiating transcription at a high rate. Others genes have [...] "weak" [...] promoters that form weak associations with transcription factors and initiate transcription less frequently. Eukaryotic promoter regions are much more complex and difficult to identify than prokaryotic promoters.|$|E
2500|$|The TATA-binding protein (TBP, a subunit of TFIID), TBPL1, or TBPL2 can {{bind the}} {{promoter}} or <b>TATA</b> <b>box.</b> Most genes lack a <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> and use an initiator element (Inr) or downstream core promoter instead. Nevertheless, TBP is always involved and {{is forced to}} bind without sequence specificity. TAFs from TFIID can also be involved when the <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> is absent. [...] A TFIID TAF will bind sequence specifically, and force the TBP to bind non-sequence specifically, bringing the remaining portions of TFIID to the promoter.|$|E
2500|$|To {{prepare for}} transcription, a {{complete}} set of general transcription factors and RNA polymerase need to be assembled at the core promoter to form the ~2 million dalton preinitiation complex. [...] For example, for promoters that contain a <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> near the TSS, the recognition of <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> by the TBP subunit of TFIID initiates the assembly of a transcription complex. The next proteins to enter are TFIIA and TFIIB, which stabilize the DNA-TFIID complex and recruit Pol II in association with TFIIF and additional transcription factors. TFIIF serves as the bridge between the TATA-bound TBP and polymerase. One of the last transcription factors to be recruited to the preinitiation complex is TFIIH, which {{plays an important role in}} promoter melting and escape.|$|E
40|$|Regulated {{expression}} of thymidine kinase mRNA in {{herpes simplex virus}} mutants harboring thymidine kinase promoters that lacked functional <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> was largely unaffected by additional sequence alterations around the transcriptional start site. A strong initiator element increased the regulated {{expression of}} a TATA-containing promoter by 50 % but did not affect that of the TATA-less promoter. Thus, initiator elements exert only small effects in this promoter context...|$|R
40|$|A {{synthetic}} oligonucleotide {{bearing the}} Drosophila heat shock consensus sequence confers heat inducibility on a CYC 1 -lacZ gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This sequence CTGGAATTTTCTAGA was inserted {{in place of}} the upstream activation sites of the CYC 1 promoter adjacent to CYC 1 <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes.</b> These constructs were transformed into yeast and found to be heat-inducible when two or more inserts were present. The level of inducibility seemed to increase with the number of inserted sequences: however, the orientations of these sequences relative to each other did not have much effect...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the {{promoter}} from the mouse VH 441 heavy-chain immunoglobulin gene, when present on plasmids transiently introduced into myeloma cells, promotes transcription bidirectionally, due to the presence on both strands of TATA-like sequences bracketing the highly conserved decanucleotide element. The two divergent promoters compete for the transcriptional machinery, their relative strength ultimately reflecting the likeness of the two <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> to the consensus sequence. Moreover, their relative activity is also strongly influenced by certain point mutations within the distally located heavy-chain enhancer. The bearing of these results on current concepts of promoter function is discussed...|$|R
2500|$|The C-terminal core of TBP (~180 residues) {{is highly}} conserved and {{contains}} two 88-amino acid repeats that produce a saddle-shaped structure that straddles the DNA; this region binds to the <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> and interacts with transcription factors and regulatory proteins [...] By contrast, the N-terminal region varies in both length and sequence.|$|E
2500|$|The TATA-binding protein (TBP) is {{a general}} {{transcription}} factor that binds specifically to a DNA sequence called the <b>TATA</b> <b>box.</b> [...] This DNA sequence is found about 30 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site in some eukaryotic gene promoters. TBP, along {{with a variety of}} TBP-associated factors, make up the TFIID, a general transcription factor that in turn makes up part of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex. As one of the few proteins in the preinitiation complex that binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner, it helps position RNA polymerase II over the transcription start site of the gene. [...] However, it is estimated that only 10–20% of human promoters have TATA boxes. [...] Therefore, TBP is probably not the only protein involved in positioning RNA polymerase II.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} shown that the DPE is about as widely used as the <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> in D. melanogaster. [...] While a DPE was found in many {{promoters}} that do not contain a <b>TATA</b> <b>box,</b> there are also promoters that contain both a <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> and a DPE.|$|E
40|$|HMG-I {{proteins}} are DNA-binding proteins {{thought to}} affect the formation and function of transcription complexes. Each protein contains three DNA-binding motifs, known as AT-hooks, that bind in the minor groove of AT tracts in DNA. Multiple AT-hooks within a polypeptide chain should contact multiple AT tracts, but the rules governing these interactions have not been defined. In this study, we demonstrate that high-affinity binding uses two or three appropriately spaced AT tracts as a single multivalent binding site. These principles have implications for binding to regulatory elements such as the interferon beta enhancer, <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes,</b> and serum response elements...|$|R
40|$|The PUT 2 gene, {{believed}} to encode delta 1 -pyrroline- 5 -carboxylate dehydrogenase, {{has been completely}} sequenced. The DNA contains an open reading frame of 1, 725 base pairs encoding a protein of 575 amino acids. Transcript mapping with both S 1 nuclease and primer extension methods revealed numerous initiation sites of RNA synthesis 50 to 80 base pairs downstream from several <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes.</b> The deduced amino acid sequence of delta 1 -pyrroline- 5 -carboxylate dehydrogenase contains a highly basic amino terminus that may serve as the signal sequence that targets this protein to the mitochondrion...|$|R
40|$|The nodule autoregulation {{receptor}} kinase (GmNARK) of soybeari (Glycine max) {{is essential for}} the systemic autoregulation of nodulation. Based on quantitative reversetranscriptase polymerase chain reaction, GmNARK is expressed to varying levels throughout the plant; the transcript was detected at high levels in mature leaves and roots but to a lesser extent in young leaves, shoot tips, and nodules. The transcript level was not significantly affected by Bradyrhizobium japonicum during the first week following inoculation. In addition, the activities of the promoters of GmIVARK and Lotus japonicus HAR 1, driving a beta-glucuronidase (GUSPlus) reporter gene, were examined in stably transformed L. japonicus and transgenic hairy roots of soybean. Histochemical GUS activity in L. japonicus plants carrying either a 1. 7 -kb GmNARKpr::GUS or 2. 0 -kb LjHAR 1 pr::GUS construct was clearly localized to living cells within vascular bundles, especially phloem cells in leaves, stems, roots, and nodules. Phloem-specific expression also was detected in soybean hairy roots carrying these constructs. Our study suggests that regulatory elements required for the transcription of these orthologous genes are conserved. Moreover, rapid amplification of 52 ̆ 7 cDNA ends (52 ̆ 7 rapid amplification of cDNA ends) revealed two major transcripts of GmNARK potentially originating from two <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes.</b> Further analysis of the GmNARK promoter has confirmed that these two <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> are functional. Deletion analysis also located a region controlling phloem-specific expression to a DNA sequence between 908 bp and 1. 7 kb upstream of the translation start site of GmNARK...|$|R
50|$|Eukaryotic genes {{contain an}} {{upstream}} promoter and a core promoter {{also referred to}} as a basal promoter. A common basal promoter is the TATAAAAAA sequence known as the <b>TATA</b> <b>box.</b> The <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> is a complex with several different proteins including transcription factor II D (TFIID) which includes the TATA-binding protein (TBP) that binds to the <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> along with 13 other proteins that bind to TBP. The <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> binding proteins also include the transcription factor II B (TFIIB) which binds to both DNA and RNA polymerases.|$|E

50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> (also {{called the}} Goldberg-Hogness box) is a DNA sequence (cis-regulatory element) {{found in the}} promoter region of genes in archaea and eukaryotes; approximately 24% of human genes contain a <b>TATA</b> <b>box</b> within the core promoter.|$|E
40|$|A SSRubisco-nos chimaeric gene {{has been}} constructed, in an oncogenic Ti-plasmid vector. A 900 bp soybean SSRubisco {{upstream}} fragment, carrying CAAT and <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> and transcription initiation point, was fused to the nos coding region, the fusion site being within the 5 '-untranslated region. When this chimaeric construct {{was transferred to}} Kalanchoe cells, nos expression was shown to be light-regulated. Thus DNA sequences responsible for light-dark control of gene expression are wholly or partly contained within the 900 bp soybean SSRubisco upstream region. Moreover, {{this is the first}} demonstration that photoregulatory elements in a gene derived from a C 3 plant, function in cells of a plant exhibiting the CAM trait...|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of characterizing {{cellular}} proteins that modulate basal transcription by RNA polymerase II, we identified a novel repressor activity specific for promoters containing consensus <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes.</b> This activity strongly represses TATA-binding protein (TBP) -dependent transcription initiation from core promoter elements containing a consensus TATA sequence, but activates TBP-dependent transcription from core promoter elements lacking a consensus TATA sequence. Purification of this activity to near homogeneity from rat liver nuclear extracts led to the surprising discovery that it co-purifies closely with mammalian transcription factor IIA (TFIIA). The close association of TATA sequence-dependent transcriptional repressor activity with TFIIA adds a new and unexpected dimension to the already complex picture of this factor's function in transcription by RNA polymerase II...|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequence of the}} Candida albicans ADE 2 gene, which encodes phosphoribosyl aminoimidazole carboxylase, has been determined. The sequence possesses an uninterrupted open reading frame of 1704 nucleotides corresponding to 568 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence shares {{a high degree of}} homology with ADE 2 homologues in other fungal species including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia methanolica, Schwanniomyces occidentalis and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Three regions of amino acid sequence were highly conserved among all reported ADE 2 genes. The hexanucleotide TGACTC characteristic of genes involved in purine and amino acid biosyntheses is located in front of putative <b>TATA</b> <b>boxes</b> in the promoter region.
