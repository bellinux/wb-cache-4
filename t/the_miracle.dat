5|$|As was {{demonstrated}} by Oleg Tvorogov and Constantine Zuckerman, among others, the 9th century and later sources {{are out of}} tune with the earliest records of the event. In his August sermon, Photius mentions neither Michael III's return to the capital nor <b>the</b> <b>miracle</b> with the veil (of which the author purportedly was a participant).|$|E
5|$|Before the game, England {{were heavy}} {{favorites}} against a hastily assembled U.S. team, which {{was composed of}} part-time players. The game's only goal was scored by the U.S.'s Haitian-born center forward Joe Gaetjens. This game and the U.S. team were profiled by author Geoffrey Douglas in his book The Game of Their Lives, which {{was made into a}} film of the same name (later renamed <b>The</b> <b>Miracle</b> Match).|$|E
5|$|In its semi-final game, the American {{team was}} upset by Sweden, marking {{the first time}} that it had lost to an {{opponent}} other than Canada.

5|$|Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht {{had lost}} {{more than a million}} men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, heard the news that the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the Führerbunker that there might yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had {{happened}} once before when Berlin was threatened (see <b>the</b> <b>Miracle</b> of the House of Brandenburg).|$|E
5|$|In another project, {{the village}} of La Vang in Quảng Trị Province near the border with North Vietnam, {{was the scene of}} a female {{apparition}} in the late 19th century. Buddhists claimed that the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (also known as Kuanyin; Vietnamese: Quan Âm) performed <b>the</b> <b>miracle.</b> Diệm's brother, Ngô Đình Thục, was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế and the foremost religious figure in South Vietnam's nepotistic regime. Thục declared that the apparition was the Virgin Mary, and ordered that a cathedral be built in place of the makeshift Buddhist pagoda that occupied the site. Thơ made notable financial donations to the project for political reasons.|$|E
5000|$|Also notable was a [...] "Motown Memories" [...] segment, where <b>the</b> <b>Miracles</b> and <b>the</b> entire cast {{sat around}} reminiscing about Motown's early days, {{and did a}} [...] "hits tribute" [...] to Smokey and his {{composed}} songs for <b>The</b> <b>Miracles</b> and other Motown acts.(almost all of these songs were co-written by {{the other members of}} <b>The</b> <b>Miracles,</b> Bobby Rogers, Pete Moore, Ronnie White, and Marv Tarplin) ...|$|R
50|$|Tarplin left <b>the</b> <b>Miracles</b> in 1973, {{shortly after}} Smokey Robinson {{and his wife}} Claudette left the group. His {{replacement}} in <b>the</b> <b>Miracles</b> was Donald Griffin, brother of Billy Griffin.(Robinson's replacement in the group).|$|R

He was part of the Munster team that won the 2002–03 Celtic League, starting and scoring 12 points as Munster beat Neath 37–17 in the Millennium Stadium.

5|$|On 12 May 1955, Kolbe was {{recognized}} as a Servant of God. Kolbe was declared venerable by Pope Paul VI on 30 January 1969, beatified as a Confessor of the Faith by the same Pope in 1971 and canonized as a saint by Pope John Paul II on 10 October 1982. Upon canonization, the Pope declared St. Maximilian Kolbe not a confessor, but a martyr. <b>The</b> <b>miracle</b> which was used to confirm his beatification was the July 1948 cure of intestinal tuberculosis in Angela Testoni, and in August 1950, the cure of calcification of the arteries/sclerosis of Francis Ranier was attributed to Kolbe's intercession.|$|E

The Dvarapalas (gate-keeper sculptures) are depicted with his heads leaning downwards, {{said to be in}} honour of Nandanar. In 1959, a shrine was created outside the Shiva temple, from where the stone image of Nandanar looks eternally at Shiva. Nandanar is depicted with his hands joined above his head, praying to Shiva. Scenes of Bharati's opera and the local legend of Nandanar and Ganesha digging the temple tank are seen on the shrine.|$|E
5|$|The final rankings {{were based}} on points {{accumulated}} in matches against the other teams in the medal round. Despite the common misconception that the Americans won gold the night they beat the Soviets, this did not occur until February 24 when they defeated Finland 4–2 and finished the tournament undefeated. The Soviets finished with silver; Sweden won the bronze. In 2008, the IIHF picked <b>the</b> <b>Miracle</b> on Ice as the top international hockey story of the past 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Wood and her {{brothers}} were {{actively involved in}} Theatre in the Park while growing up, including an appearance by her in the 1987 production of her father's musical comedy adaptation of A Christmas Carol {{when she was just}} a few months old.

5|$|After his cathedral {{church was}} burned down in 1114, Luffa managed to secure King Henry I's {{financial}} help in rebuilding the church. Besides the rebuilding, Luffa built a Lady chapel, which still remains. Other work still extant {{in the cathedral}} are the arcades, the exteriors of the clerestory and those galleries that are unvaulted. The art historian George Zarnecki {{has argued that the}} rood screen in the cathedral also dates from Luffa's episcopate. Two panels from this work still survive, and depict the meeting of Jesus with Mary and Martha at Bethany as well as <b>the</b> <b>miracle</b> where Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead. The scenes show some resemblance to works in Hildesheim and Cologne, and this resemblance may mean that Luffa was from Germany, or hired sculptors from there.|$|E
5|$|Alvin Plantinga's {{free will}} defense {{is a logical}} {{argument}} developed by American analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga, the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, and published in its final version in his 1977 book God, Freedom, and Evil. Plantinga's argument is a defense against the logical problem of evil as formulated by philosopher J. L. Mackie beginning in 1955. Mackie's formulation of the logical problem of evil argued that three attributes of God, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, in orthodox Christian theism are logically incompatible with the existence of evil. In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in <b>The</b> <b>Miracle</b> of Theism, {{though he did not}} claim that the problem of evil had been put to rest.|$|E
5|$|Americans' mistrust and {{dislike of}} lawyers was a {{frequent}} topic of dissection in social problem films such Lawyer Man (1933), State's Attorney, and The Mouthpiece (1932). In films such as Paid (1930), the legal system turns innocent characters into criminals. The life of Joan Crawford's character is ruined and her romantic interest is executed so that she may live free, although she is innocent of the crime for which the district attorney wants to convict her. Religious hypocrisy was addressed in such films as <b>The</b> <b>Miracle</b> Woman (1931), starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Frank Capra. Stanwyck also portrayed a nurse and initially reluctant heroine who manages to save, via unorthodox means, two young children in danger from nefarious characters (including Clark Gable as a malevolent chauffeur) in Night Nurse (1931).|$|E
