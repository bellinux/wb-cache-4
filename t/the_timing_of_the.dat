5|$|Galileo {{was able}} to develop a method of {{determining}} longitude based on <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> orbits of the Galilean moons.

The method was used by Cassini and Picard to re-map France.|$|E
5|$|Golden jackals are monogamous {{and will}} remain with the one partner until death. Female jackals have only one {{breeding}} cycle each year. Breeding occurs from October to March in Israel and from February to March in India, Turkmenistan, Bulgaria, and Transcaucasia, with the mating period lasting up to 26–28 days. Females undergoing their first estrus are often pursued by several males that may quarrel among themselves. Mating results in a copulatory tie that lasts for several minutes, as it does with all other canids. Gestation lasts 63 days, and <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> births coincides with the annual abundance of food.|$|E
5|$|In August 1945, {{shortly after}} the bombing of Hiroshima, the Kodak Company {{observed}} spotting and fogging on their film, which {{was at that time}} usually packaged in cardboard containers. Dr. J. H. Webb, a Kodak employee, studied the matter and concluded that the contamination must have come from a nuclear explosion somewhere in the United States. He discounted the possibility that the Hiroshima bomb was responsible, due to <b>the</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> events. A hot spot of fallout contaminated the river water that the paper mill in Indiana used to manufacture the cardboard pulp from corn husks. Aware of the gravity of his discovery, Dr. Webb kept this secret until 1949.|$|E

5|$|Polacanthids {{are known}} from pre-Aptian fauna from both Europe and North America. <b>The</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{appearance}} of nodosaurids on both continents indicates {{the origins of}} the clade preceded the isolation of North America and Europe, thereby pushing the group's date of evolution back to at least the middle Aptian.

Assembly F-33 was expended testing the components and F-31 was designated for the August 9 mission.|$|E

5|$|After hatching, the {{offspring}} {{feed on the}} tissue of the cicadas provided by their mother.

5|$|After {{leaving office}} as CGS, Dannatt {{effectively}} {{retired from the}} Army, but technically remained a serving officer until November 2009. Shortly after leaving office, Dannatt was approached by David Cameron, then leader of the Conservative Party and Leader of the Opposition. Cameron invited Dannatt to become a defence adviser for the Shadow Cabinet once he was officially retired from the Army and no longer bound by Queen's Regulations, which mandate political neutrality in the armed forces. Although uncommon for a former service chief to align himself with one political party, Dannatt accepted the role on an informal basis. <b>The</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision, which became public in October 2009—within two months of Dannatt's effective retirement—attracted some controversy, with some former ministers and civil servants suggesting it potentially compromised the neutrality of the armed forces. He advised Cameron and his shadow cabinet until he resigned, shortly after the 2010 general election, stating that Cameron, by then prime minister, should turn to the incumbent chiefs of staff for defence advice and citing no desire to become a special adviser.|$|E
5|$|An enhanced-potency IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) was {{licensed}} in the United States in November 1987, and {{is currently}} the vaccine of choice in the United States. The first dose of polio vaccine is given shortly after birth, usually between 1 and 2 months of age, a second dose is given at 4 months of age. <b>The</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> third dose depends on the vaccine formulation but should be given between 6 and 18 months of age. A booster vaccination is given at 4 to 6 years of age, {{for a total of}} four doses at or before school entry. In some countries, a fifth vaccination is given during adolescence. Routine vaccination of adults (18 years of age and older) in developed countries is neither necessary nor recommended because most adults are already immune and have a very small risk of exposure to wild poliovirus in their home countries. In 2002, a pentavalent (five-component) combination vaccine (called Pediarix) containing IPV was approved for use in the United States.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rift}} between {{the players and}} Brown and between Modell and Brown grew, Modell fired Brown on January 7, 1963.

Blanton Collier, Brown's longtime assistant, was named the team's new head coach, and Brown began to plan his next move as he continued to receive an $82,500 salary under his eight-year contract.|$|E
