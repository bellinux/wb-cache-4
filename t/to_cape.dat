5|$|December 1941 saw Siboney {{depart from}} New York to Trinidad and on <b>to</b> <b>Cape</b> Town, then sailing up {{the east coast}} of Africa to Basra, Iraq, and Bandar Shahpur, Iran. The ship {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>Cape</b> Town via Aden and underwent routine boiler repairs there, before returning to New York in April 1942. After undergoing sixweeks of repairs at Bethlehem Steel Company, the transport sailed for Halifax, Iceland, and the Clyde, Scotland, in late May, returning to New York in July. Another trip to England and back followed in September 1942.|$|E

The tropical storm watch was later extended from the North Carolina/Virginia border <b>to</b> <b>Cape</b> Charles, Virginia, including Virginia Beach.

5|$|What is now Route55 was {{originally}} {{proposed in the}} 1950s as a toll road called the Cape May Expressway that was to run from the Walt Whitman Bridge <b>to</b> <b>Cape</b> May. In 1962, the New Jersey Expressway Authority was created to build the Cape May Expressway and the Atlantic City Expressway. However, by 1965, the road <b>to</b> <b>Cape</b> May {{was turned over to}} the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) and designated as Route55, which was to run from Westville <b>to</b> <b>Cape</b> May Court House. The first portion of the route opened around Millville in 1969 while the section bypassing Vineland was completed in the 1970s. Route55 was completed north to Deptford in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Walt Whitman Bridge in the 1950s, two toll expressways were proposed to connect the bridge to Atlantic City and <b>to</b> <b>Cape</b> May. In 1962, the New Jersey Expressway Authority Act was signed into law. This act created the New Jersey Expressway Authority, which was to manage both the Atlantic City and Cape May expressways.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, Biko {{broke his}} banning order by {{travelling}} <b>to</b> <b>Cape</b> Town, hoping to meet Unity Movement leader Neville Alexander {{and deal with}} growing dissent in the Western Cape branch of the BCM, which was dominated by Marxists like Johnny Issel. Biko drove to the city with his Coloured friend Peter Jones on 17 August, but Alexander refused to meet with Biko, fearing {{that he was being}} monitored by the police. Biko and Jones drove back toward King William's Town, but on 18 August they were stopped at a police roadblock near Grahamstown. Biko was arrested for having violated the order restricting him to King William's Town. Unsubstantiated claims have been made that the security services were aware of Biko's trip <b>to</b> <b>Cape</b> Town and that the road block had been erected to catch him. Jones was also arrested at the roadblock; he was subsequently held without trial for 533 days, during which he was interrogated on numerous occasions.|$|E

50|$|The African Free Trade Zone {{announced}} at the EAC-SADC-COMESA Summit (also known the AFTZ Summit and Tripartite Summit) effectively is the realization of a dream {{more than a hundred}} years in the making, a trade zone spanning the length of African continent from <b>Cape</b> <b>to</b> Cairo, from North African Egypt all the way to the southernmost tip of Africa in South Africa (Cape Town). The <b>Cape</b> <b>to</b> Cairo dream was envisioned by Cecil Rhodes and other British imperialists in the 1890s and was expressed in different contexts and versions including, but not limited to, the following ideals: <b>Cape</b> <b>to</b> Cairo Road, <b>Cape</b> <b>to</b> Cairo Railway, <b>Cape</b> <b>to</b> Cairo Telegraph, and <b>Cape</b> <b>to</b> Cairo Trade Union.|$|R

5|$|In {{preparation}} of the tropical depression, officials in Puerto Rico closed public schools and sent federal workers home early. At 1000UTC on August28, a tropical storm watch was issued for Edisto Beach, South Carolina, <b>to</b> <b>Cape</b> Hatteras, North Carolina. Two hours later, areas from Savannah, Georgia, <b>to</b> <b>Cape</b> Hatteras North Carolina, were placed under a tropical storm warning. They were later discontinued at an unknown time. Residents of Charleston, South Carolina, complained of little warning {{in advance of the}} storm. However, as Chris moved ashore only nine hours after becoming a tropical storm, there was minimal time for preparations.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Falke {{had been}} sent to Liberia on 27 May in {{response}} to unrest in the country. She arrived in Monrovia on 9 June, and temporarily took Joseph James Cheeseman, the President of Liberia, aboard to protect him from the rebels. Falke wa back in Duala by 22 July. She was sent <b>to</b> <b>Cape</b> Town in South Africa for an overhaul that began on 30 November, but a rebellion among the Khoikhoi in German South-West Africa forced a postponement of the work; by 5 December the ship was in the colony to join the effort to suppress the rebels. Her presence proved to be unnecessary, and so she was sent back <b>to</b> <b>Cape</b> Town later in the month. After she arrived, the Admiralstab (Admiralty Staff) transferred Falke to the colony in German New Guinea. Falke departed on 23 December, arriving in Melbourne via Sydney.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued {{from the mouth}} of the Altamaha River in Georgia <b>to</b> <b>Cape</b> Fear, North Carolina. The next day, the watch was replaced with a tropical storm warning, which was later extended to Currituck Beach Light in Corolla, North Carolina before the storm moved ashore. In South Carolina, voluntary evacuations occurred in Charleston and Colleton counties.|$|E

5|$|Several other {{journeys}} {{were completed}} during Scott's absence. Royds and Bernacchi travelled for 31days on the Barrier in a SE direction, observing its uniformly flat character and making further magnetic readings.

5|$|Shackleton's {{original}} {{intention was}} to sail down <b>to</b> <b>Cape</b> Town, visiting the main South Atlantic islands on the way. From Cape Town, Quest would head for the Enderby Land coast of Antarctica where, once in the ice, it would explore the coastline towards Coats Land in the Weddell Sea. At {{the end of the}} summer season the ship would visit South Georgia before returning <b>to</b> <b>Cape</b> Town for refitting and preparation for the second year's work. The ship's performance in the early stages of the voyage disrupted this schedule. Serious problems with the engine necessitated a week's stay in Lisbon, and further stops in Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands. These delays and the slow speed of the ship led Shackleton to decide that it would be necessary to sacrifice entirely the visits to the South Atlantic islands, and instead he turned the ship towards Rio de Janeiro, where the engine could receive a thorough overhaul. Quest reached Rio on 22 November 1921.|$|E

5|$|Starting in late December, {{widespread}} rains {{produced by}} the precursor to Helen prompted the issuance of flood warnings throughout the Top End region. Prior {{to the arrival of}} Cyclone Helen on 4January, the Bureau of Meteorology issued cyclone warnings for areas between the Mitchell Plateau, in Western Australia, <b>to</b> <b>Cape</b> Hotham in the Northern Territory. According to local officials, flooding was the greatest concern from the storm rather than wind damage. The warning area was later condensed to encompass areas from Wadeye <b>to</b> <b>Cape</b> Hotham, including Darwin and the Tiwi Islands. By 6January, warnings were issued for the western coast of the Cape York Peninsula between Karumba and Weipa as the remnants of Helen were forecast to regain storm intensity.|$|E
