40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to add automatic target recognition (ATR) capabilities to existing passive radar systems.

5|$|Following Habyarimana's death, a {{military}} committee led by Colonel Théoneste Bagosora took immediate {{control of the}} country. Under the committee's direction, the Hutu militia Interahamwe and the Presidential Guard began to kill Hutu and Tutsi opposition politicians and other prominent Tutsi figures; within 24 hours they had killed all moderate leaders, including Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana. The killers then began <b>targeting</b> <b>the</b> entire Tutsi population, as well as moderate Hutu, beginning the Rwandan Genocide. Over the course of approximately 100 days, over 1,000,000 Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks.|$|E

30|$|To sum up, the {{infrared}} radiation of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is very complex, which {{is because the}} factors affecting {{the infrared}} radiation of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> are multifaceted, including the radiation of <b>the</b> <b>target</b> surface, <b>the</b> absorption and reflectivity of <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>the</b> climate conditions, the selective absorption and scattering of the atmosphere, the atmospheric scintillation, the velocity of <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> <b>the</b> surface coating and heat insulation, {{the noise of the}} circuit, and so on.|$|R

The lower bound of localization error is utilized according to the distances between <b>the</b> <b>target</b> and <b>the</b> selected active nodes. Furthermore, the direction likelihoods of the active nodes is predicted {{by way of the}} node/target bearing distributing relationships...|$|R

In preparation for Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, his unit moved to Eichwalde in East Prussia.

50|$|Decommodification {{has been}} {{identified}} as a strategy for sustainable consumption that acts one level up on the institutional context of consumption in Western societies as compared to strategies such as eco-efficiency and eco-sufficiency. Thus, while <b>the</b> eco-efficiency strategy <b>targets</b> <b>the</b> product and <b>the</b> eco-sufficiency strategy <b>targets</b> <b>the</b> person (the consumer as decision-maker), <b>the</b> decommodification strategy <b>targets</b> <b>the</b> institutional context in which consumption takes place.

5|$|New {{and shorter}} target substems were adopted in 2009. They mostly {{consist of a}} consonant, plus a vowel which is omitted if the source substem begins with a vowel. For example, human {{antibodies}} <b>targeting</b> <b>the</b> immune system receive names ending in -lumab instead of the old -limumab. Some endings like -ciximab remain unchanged. The old system employed seven different substems for tumor targets, {{depending on the type}} of tumor. Because many antibodies are investigated for several tumor types, the new convention only has -t(u)-.|$|E
5|$|Recommended therapies for {{first-line}} use in acne vulgaris treatment include topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, and topical or oral antibiotics. Procedures such {{as light}} therapy and laser therapy {{are not considered}} to be first-line treatments and typically have an adjunctive role due to their high cost and limited evidence of efficacy. Medications for acne work by <b>targeting</b> <b>the</b> early stages of comedo formation and are generally ineffective for visible skin lesions; improvement in the appearance of acne is typically expected between six and eight weeks after starting therapy.|$|E

50|$|As {{with the}} ISCSI Extensions for RDMA (iSER) {{communication}} protocol, {{there is the}} notion of a target (a system that stores the data) and an initiator (a client accessing <b>the</b> <b>target)</b> with <b>the</b> <b>target</b> performing <b>the</b> actual data movement.

5|$|Anderson met Todd and Quantrill on September 24, 1864; {{although}} they had clashed in the past, they agreed to work together. Anderson suggested that they attack Fayette, Missouri, <b>targeting</b> <b>the</b> 9th Missouri Cavalry, which was based at the town. Quantrill disliked the idea because the town was fortified, but Anderson and Todd prevailed. Clad in Union uniforms, the guerrillas generated little suspicion {{as they approached the}} town, even though it had received warning of nearby guerrillas. However, a guerrilla fired his weapon before they reached the town, and the cavalry quickly withdrew into their fort while civilians hid. Anderson and Todd launched an unsuccessful attack against the fort, leading charge after futile charge without injury. The defeat resulted in the deaths of five guerrillas but only two Union soldiers, further maddening Anderson.|$|E

Simultaneously the British ship of the line HMS Sceptre arrived from Fort Royal on Martinique under the command of Captain Samuel James Ballard, who immediately assumed command of the diverse squadron assembled {{at the entrance to the}} bay. Ballard dismissed the French negotiators and ordered an immediate attack on the anchored frigates. His plan was simple: Blonde and Thetis would enter the harbour and engage the flûtes directly, while Sceptre and Freija would engage the gun batteries to prevent them <b>targeting</b> <b>the</b> small brigs bringing up the rear. The brigs would be towing boats full of sailors and Royal Marines, who would storm the French ships and gun positions as they were engaged with the larger warships.|$|E

40|$|This note {{examines}} the effort choice {{problem of a}} decision maker (DM) who has to meet a <b>target.</b> <b>The</b> more the DM spends on effort, the more likely <b>the</b> <b>target</b> is reached. Besides the risk of missing <b>the</b> <b>target</b> despite his effort, the DM faces additional uncertainty in that both <b>the</b> <b>target</b> and <b>the</b> status quo are subject to exogenous shocks that are beyond the DM's control. We consider two cases: the additive {{case in which the}} DM's effort affects solely the likelihood of achieving <b>the</b> <b>target,</b> and <b>the</b> multiplicative case in which the DM's effort also has direct effect on <b>the</b> <b>target</b> and <b>the</b> status quo. Using the theory of monotone comparative statics and risk apportionment, we derive sufficient conditions under which the DM spends more on effort when <b>the</b> <b>target</b> experiences an improvement in risk via higher-order stochastic dominance...|$|R
