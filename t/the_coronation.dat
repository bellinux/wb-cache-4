5|$|Banquets {{have not}} been held at Westminster Hall since <b>the</b> <b>{{coronation}}</b> of GeorgeIV in 1821.

Since 1901, a Coronation Fleet Review has also been held. To celebrate <b>the</b> <b>coronation,</b> a coronation honours list is also released before <b>the</b> <b>coronation.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Roman {{imperial}} <b>coronation</b> ritual {{had certain}} unique elements which distinguished it {{from those of}} <b>the</b> royal <b>coronation</b> rituals developed in <b>the</b> European royal <b>coronation</b> rituals, e.g., <b>the</b> stational character of the ritual in which individual parts of the ritual took place {{in different parts of}} the papal basilica (usually that of St. Peter's in the Vatican) and <b>the</b> imperial <b>coronation</b> is quite unique in not having a solemn enthronement of the monarch (or even any use of a throne at all) in its ritual. Instead of an enthronement ritual we find the chanting of the Laudes Regiae, which paralleled in both form and importance its Byzantine imperial counterpart. Indeed, only those European coronation rituals which were directly modelled on the Roman imperial ritual, i.e., <b>the</b> papal <b>coronation</b> and <b>the</b> royal <b>coronation</b> ritual in <b>the</b> Roman Pontifical, also include such chanting of a Laudes.|$|R

5|$|During January and February 1170 {{the king}} sent Barre on a {{diplomatic}} {{mission to the}} pope in Rome, on a matter related to the king's dispute with Becket. The mission attempted to secure the rescinding of the excommunication of those whom Becket had placed under clerical ban, but it was unsuccessful; rumours circulated that the mission sought and secured papal permission for <b>the</b> <b>coronation</b> of King Henry's eldest living son by someone other than Becket. When Becket protested to Pope Alexander III over this usurpation {{of the right of}} the archbishop to crown English kings, Alexander not only stated that no such permission had been granted but threatened to suspend or depose any bishop who crowned Henry's heir. Barlow thinks it possible that Barre received a verbal agreement from the pope in January to allow <b>the</b> <b>coronation,</b> but there is no written evidence that Alexander agreed to allow <b>the</b> <b>coronation</b> in 1170.|$|E
