500|$|After {{the first}} race, Stewart {{drove to the}} victory lane; the win earned him $55,725. He said, [...] "The fact that we've won 17 times here and not won on the right day is proof it's good momentum, but it's no {{guarantee}} obviously. It's nice to come here, especially for Steve and I, being our first race together, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out and have two really good strong and solid races back-to-back is an awesome start for us." [...] Earnhardt felt that the race was [...] "pretty good" [...] and praised Stewart for his victory. He {{also said that he}} aimed to start the Daytona 500 without using a backup car. Ambrose was happy with his third-place finish, [...] "We learned a lot for Sunday, we got a good result. We are smiling right now but it was very close to being the other way around." [...] He also said he was hoping to carry on his good form into the Daytona 500.|$|E

2500|$|The Beach Boys' surf {{music was}} not entirely of their own invention, being preceded by artists such as Dick Dale. However, {{previous}} surf musicians did not project a world view as the Beach Boys did. Wilson once said of its myth: [...] "It's not just the surfing; it's the outdoors and cars and sunshine; it's the society of California; it's the way of California." [...] Al Jardine of the Beach Boys argued that [...] "It’s not entirely a myth. There are still some elements that are certainly true, especially for a first-time observer. But <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> here and to drive that coast on Route 1 ... you experience {{the water and the}} animals and the sea life, the whole thing. It’s really magical. It really is." [...] Capitol Records staff producer Nick Venet, who worked with the group early on, believed that Hollywood films was where most of the group's lyrical inspiration was drawn.|$|E
2500|$|Dutch {{law allows}} {{associations}} (verenigingen) and foundations (stichtingen) {{to bring a}} so-called collective action on behalf of other persons, provided they can represent the interests of such persons according to their by-laws (statuten) (section 3:305a Dutch Civil Code). All types of actions are permitted, excluding a claim for monetary damages. Most class actions {{over the past decade}} have been in the field of securities fraud and financial services. The acting association or foundation may come to a collective settlement with the defendant. The settlement may also include– and usually primarily consists of– monetary compensation of damages. Such settlement can be declared binding for all injured parties by the Amsterdam Court of Appeal (section 7:907 Dutch Civil Code). [...] The injured parties have an opt-out right during the opt-out period set by the Court, usually 3 to 6 months. Interestingly, settlements involving injured parties from outside The Netherlands can also be declared binding by the Court. Notably since US courts are reluctant to take up class actions brought on behalf of injured parties not residing in the US who have suffered damages due to acts or omissions committed outside the US, it may be interesting to combine a US class action and a Dutch collective action <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to a settlement that covers plaintiffs worldwide. An example of this is the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Reserves Settlement that was declared binding upon both US and non-US plaintiffs.|$|E
