5|$|By 1980, Gulf {{exhibited}} many of {{the characteristics}} of a giant corporation that had lost its way. It had a huge but poorly performing asset portfolio, associated with a depressed share price. The stock market value of Gulf started to drop below <b>the</b> <b>break-up</b> value of its assets. Such a situation was bound to attract the interest of corporate raiders, although a corporation in the top 100 of the Fortune 500 was in the early 1980s thought immune to takeover risk.|$|E
5|$|In May 1968, protesting {{students}} {{occupied the}} Sorbonne {{and put up}} barricades in the Latin Quarter. Thousands of Parisian blue-collar workers joined the students, and the movement grew into a two-week general strike. Supporters of the government won the June elections by a large majority.

5|$|After divorcing Leah, Miller married Mary Arnold, whom he {{met through}} Kenny Rogers. Arnold {{was a member of}} The First Edition, a band that {{included}} Rogers.

After <b>the</b> <b>break-up</b> of The First Edition, she performed with her husband Miller on tours, including a White House performance for President Gerald Ford. In 2009, she was inducted into the Iowa Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame. She currently manages Roger Miller's estate. She sued Sony for copyright infringement in the 2007 case , which went to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Arnold was ultimately awarded nearly $1million in royalties and rights to the songs Miller wrote in 1964.|$|E

5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>break-up,</b> Strummer {{contacted}} Jones in {{an effort}} to reform the Clash. Jones, however, had already formed a new band, Big Audio Dynamite (B.A.D.), that had released its debut late in 1985. The two did work together on their respective 1986 projects. Jones helped out with the two songs Strummer wrote and performed for the Sid and Nancy soundtrack. Strummer, in turn, cowrote a number of the tracks on the second B.A.D. album, No.10, Upping St., which he also co-produced. With Jones committed to B.A.D., Strummer moved on to various solo projects and screen acting work. Simonon formed a band called Havana 3am. Headon recorded a solo album, before once again spiraling into drug abuse. Chimes drummed with a succession of different acts.|$|E
5|$|Atrash {{supported}} {{formation of}} the United Arab Republic (UAR), a union between Syria and Egypt, in 1958. During the UAR years, Atrash became a devoted Nasserite—a supporter of President Gamal Abdel Nasser's policies—and wrote several articles in Nasserite daily newspaper Al Jamahir ("The People.") Atrash opposed <b>the</b> <b>break-up</b> of the union after a secessionist coup in September 1961, and opposed playing a political role in the anti-unionist governments that succeeded the UAR; Prime Minister Bashir al-Azma (term in 1962) offered him a cabinet post, but he turned down the offer, citing his ideological opposition to a secessionist government. Prime Minister Khalid al-Azm (term in 1962–63) appointed him minister of social affairs without asking him, but Atrash turned down that job as well.|$|E
5|$|Following the election, Mat Herben {{was chosen}} as LPF party leader as Fortuyn's successor. Together with the CDA and the VVD, the party formed part of the {{governing}} coalition, and supplied several members for the Balkenende cabinet. The party was granted four of fourteen cabinet seats, for immigration, economics, health and sports. But without its original leader and lack of a clearly defined organisational structure, the LPF soon succumbed to highly public internal squabbles. By October2002, <b>the</b> <b>break-up</b> of the government coalition was triggered by the bickering of LPF Ministers Eduard Bomhoff and Herman Heinsbroek.|$|E

5|$|Germany's borders {{underwent}} {{many changes}} during the 20th century, which {{had an effect}} on the make-up of the German football team. After the annexation of Austria, the Austrian team was absorbed into the German team, resulting in the inclusion of several Austrians in Germany's 1938 World Cup squad. After World War II and <b>the</b> <b>break-up</b> of Germany, two breakaway national teams were formed: Saarland (1950–56) and East Germany (1952–90). During this period, the team was commonly known as West Germany until the country's reunification in 1990, when the East German team was reintegrated into the German national team.|$|E
5|$|However, Dot causes {{trouble for}} certain {{residents}} too, although not intentionally. She {{is responsible for}} <b>the</b> <b>break-up</b> of Saeed Jeffery's (Andrew Johnson) marriage to Naima Jeffery (Shreela Ghosh). Due {{to the lack of}} lust in his marriage to Naima, Saeed begins visiting prostitutes. After continual pressure, Naima relents and finally consummates her marriage to Saeed, improving things between the couple (their marriage was arranged to begin with, much to their disliking), but their marital bliss is short-lived. Naima receives an anonymous letter from Dot, who has discovered Saeed's sordid exploits. Dot feels it is her Christian duty to inform Saeed's wife, and when Naima confronts Saeed, he does not deny it so she leaves him.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, the {{football}} team's 10–0 season {{culminated in a}} 28–13 victory over first-ranked Tennessee in the 1952 Sugar Bowl. Maryland's participation, however, was in violation of a Southern Conference resolution passed mid-season that banned participation in postseason bowl games. Byrd had Maryland accept the bowl invitation, despite Tatum's objections. The coach thought the threatened sanctions, which prevented Maryland from playing any Southern Conference games the following season, would severely disadvantage his team. In 1952, Maryland and Clemson, which had also violated the bowl game ban, were sanctioned, and the incident hastened <b>the</b> <b>break-up</b> of the Southern Conference and formation of the Atlantic Coast Conference, of which both schools were founding members.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{findings}} of a numerical investigation on <b>the</b> droplet <b>break-up</b> in a microfluidic T-junction. The numerical flow visualization of the droplet formation process is validated with the experimental flow visualization. From the computational results, we show that the pressure profile of the dispersed phase and the continuous phase in the squeezing regime changes as <b>the</b> droplet <b>break-up</b> process proceeds. <b>The</b> assumption taken by other researchers that the dispersed phase pressure profile, during the droplet formation process at a T-junction, remains constant and only the continuous phase pressure changes according to the blockage of the channel is proved to be invalid. We provide new insights on the pressure difference between the dispersed phase and the continuous phase during <b>the</b> droplet <b>break-up</b> process and show that the minimum pressure difference happens at the last moment of <b>the</b> droplet <b>break-up</b> and not during the second and third stage of the droplet formation mechanism in the squeezing regime as suggested by other researchers.
