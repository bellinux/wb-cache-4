5|$|After Debonnaire's {{death in}} 1833, Hesketh-Fleetwood {{immersed}} himself in his development plans. Southport, a town he owned much of, was becoming a popular sea bathing resort, and Hesketh-Fleetwood organised {{the construction of a}} promenade. He was becoming concerned over delays {{on the part of the}} Railway and Port Company and decided <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> with building Fleetwood. He hired his old friend Decimus Burton, who had become a successful architect, and together they discussed what buildings would be required. Hesketh-Fleetwood wanted a church, docks, housing, a gas office, a school and a hotel. Burton agreed that a hotel would be important for passengers to spend the night before travelling on to Scotland. Because those passengers would be arriving from Euston railway station in London, Hesketh-Fleetwood decided to call the hotel the North Euston Hotel. Burton's plans were ready by 1835.|$|E
5|$|After {{the branch}} north of Fort Totten opened, the Green Line Commuter Shortcut {{began as a}} six-month {{experiment}} on January 27, 1997, allowing passengers <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> a train on the Green Line segment during rush hours and travel as far as Farragut North on the Red Line without having to switch trains at Fort Totten; a transfer was needed during off-peak hours. This was accomplished by utilizing a single-track spur (B & E connection) between the Green and Red Lines near (and bypassing) Fort Totten station. This shortcut was so well-received that it was continued until September 17, 1999, when the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed.|$|E

It captures a brilliantly teenage sensation ("only music can save me from my shit life") but makes sense {{of it in a}} song that doesn't sound like she's trying too hard to be down with the kids... Real life is sometimes a bit more complicated than that, and sometimes freedom is about being able to leave the cunts behind <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> with their useless lives.

5|$|At about 3:30am on Thursday, 25 February, Gothenburg {{continued}} to heel over. The deck became so steep that {{passengers and crew}} had to climb over the rails <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> her side. At about 4:00am, the two remaining starboard lifeboats were lowered and were rushed by the passengers. One starboard lifeboat, crammed with women and children, capsized when others tried to board it. Some half dozen men righted her in the water, but, damaged and without oars, food or water, it quickly drifted away and was never found. The second starboard lifeboat also capsized when the sea crashed over, washing all the occupants into the sea. One passenger recalled the sea on the downwind {{side of the ship}} being covered with human heads bobbing up and down like corks. Five or six men and one woman climbed onto the upturned hull. The boat was still connected to its painter, but it was unable to be recovered from the heavy sea and wind which swept the woman off and drowned her. A passenger, John Cleland, swam to the connected, but upturned lifeboat and further secured it with a rope tied to Gothenburg. In less than fifteen minutes, nearly 100 people had drowned; washed away or trapped in their water-filled cabins. By this time, several sharks were circling the wreck.|$|E

5|$|Before {{reaching}} movie audiences, hip-hop {{dance was}} already being broadcast on television. Soul Train was a , music variety show that featured social dancing and performances by African-American soul, funk, and R singers. The show was broadcast in South Korea via the US Armed Forces Korea Network. Before officially becoming a crew, The Lockers made several appearances on this show. After becoming a crew, The Electric Boogaloos also {{appeared on the}} show. Soul Train premiered in 1970. During its 36 year run, the resident freestyle dancers were {{referred to as the}} Soul Train Gang. Auditions were held in 1971 when the show moved from Chicago, Illinois to Los Angeles, California. Dancers who wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> Soul Train after this time had to rely on word-of-mouth recommendations from dancers who were already employed by the show. A regular feature during the broadcast was the Soul Train Line. To participate in the Soul Train Line, the dancers formed two lines of equal length facing each other with a large space in between them. Each dancer in line would take their turn dancing down the middle.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 31 May 1810, Ernest, by his written account, was struck in the head several times while asleep in bed, {{awakening}} him. He ran for the door, where he was wounded in the leg by a sabre. He called for help, and one of his valets, Cornelius Neale, responded and aided him. Neale raised the alarm, and the household soon realised that Ernest's other valet, Joseph Sellis, was not among them, and that the door to Sellis's room was locked. The lock was forced, and Sellis was discovered with his throat freshly cut, a wound apparently self-inflicted. Ernest received several serious wounds during the apparent attack, and required over a month to recover from his injuries. The social reformer and anti-monarchist Francis Place managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the inquest jury and became its foreman. Place went to the office of a barrister friend to study inquest law, and aggressively questioned witnesses. Place also insisted the inquest be opened to the public and press, and so cowed the coroner that he basically ran the inquest himself. Nevertheless, the jury returned a unanimous verdict of suicide against Sellis.|$|E

After several {{unsuccessful}} attempts <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>on</b> the bus, SpongeBob heads to a bus station and waits {{in a very long}} line. By the time he reaches the front, he finds out that the next bus leaves in 5 seconds; he misses it, then learns that it was the last one and he is stuck there until morning. He becomes frightened by a raspberry sound coming from off in the distance, and he dashes back to the cliff in terror. Finally, the raspberry sound's maker is revealed to be a friendly-looking anglerfish creature, who has retrieved SpongeBob's glove balloon. The creature blows up the balloon and ties it to SpongeBob's wrist, which allows him to rise up the cliff and float back to Bikini Bottom. The episode ends with Patrick {{on his way back to}} Rock Bottom, thinking SpongeBob is still there.|$|E
