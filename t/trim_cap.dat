[...] "I think that it is more than probable--" [...] He paused, and I was surprised, on glancing round to see that he was staring with {{singular}} intentness at the lady's profile. Surprise and satisfaction were both for an instant to be read upon his eager face, though when she glanced round to find out the cause of his silence he had become as demure as ever. I stared hard myself at her flat, grizzled hair, her <b>trim</b> <b>cap,</b> her little gilt earrings, her placid features; but I could see nothing which could account for my companion's evident excitement.|$|E
60|$|Good Colet {{was always}} {{accessible}} to the meanest, {{but he had been}} very ill, and the porter had some doubts about troubling him respecting the substantial young matron whose <b>trim</b> <b>cap</b> and bodice, and full petticoats, showed no tokens of distress. However, when she begged him to take in her message, that she prayed the Dean to listen to her touching the child of the old man who was slain on May Eve, he consented; and she was at once admitted to an inner chamber, where Colet, wrapped in a gown lined with lambskin, sat by the fire, looking so wan and feeble that it went to the good woman's heart and she began by an apology for troubling him.|$|E

25|$|V. acadica queens {{are rarely}} {{aggressive}} towards workers. However in certain situations, queens have been consistently observed {{to behave in}} a more aggressive manner than usual. Often during oviposition or related activities, queens put on displays to make the workers avoid or back down from the queen. These most commonly occurred when a worker was <b>trimming</b> a <b>cap</b> remnant or antennating an emerging individual which is a behavior usually {{carried out by the}} queen. In most cases, workers will begin the process of cell inspection but then back down and allow the queen to finish <b>trimming</b> a <b>cap</b> and then to oviposit.|$|R

5000|$|Hotel Charitone is a {{historic}} building located in Chariton, Iowa, United States. Local architect William L. Perkins designed the building in the Neoclassical style. It was his second major commission in town after the Chariton Herald-Patriot Building (1918). [...] Local contractor P.E. Johnson constructed the building. It opened on November 5, 1923 and remained in operation as a hotel with some apartments under various owners. The buildings had fallen into disrepair and was vacant when Hy-Vee, a grocery store chain that had been headquartered in Chariton for years spearheaded the renovation of the building {{as an act of}} gratitude for the community's support. [...] A Hy-Vee Market Grill opened in May 2014, and the upper floors house 12 apartments. The four-story brick structure features three arched windows {{on the first floor of}} the west, and two that flank the main entrance on the south elevation. A third window on this side of the building had been converted into a doorway into the hotel's restaurant by 1935. [...] A brick parapet with stone <b>trim</b> <b>caps</b> the structure, and decorative brickwork descends from the cornice on the corners. A neon sign was added in the 1930s. The building was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

5000|$|The 1967 Deluxe Interior was revised, discontinuing the {{embossed}} running horse motif on {{the seat}} backs (the source for the [...] "pony interior" [...] nickname) {{in favor of a}} new deluxe interior package, which included special color options, brushed aluminum (from August 1966 production) or woodgrain dash trim, seat buttons, and special door panels. The hardtop also included upholstered quarter trim panels, a carryover from the 1965-66 deluxe interior. The 1967 hardtop also had the chrome quarter <b>trim</b> <b>caps,</b> carried over from 1965-66, but these were painted to match the interior in 1968 models. The 1967 deluxe interior included stainless steel-trimmed seat back shells, similar to those in the Thunderbird. These were dropped {{at the end of the}} 1967 model year, and were not included in the woodgrain-trimmed 1968 interior. The deluxe steering wheel, which had been included in the deluxe interior for the 1965-66, became optional, and could also be ordered with the standard interior. The 1968 models that were produced from January 1968 were also the first model year to incorporate three-point lap and shoulder belts (which had previously been optional, in 1967-68 models) as opposed to the standard lap belts. The air-conditioning option was fully integrated into the dash, the speakers and stereo were upgraded, and unique center and overhead consoles were options. The fastback model offered the option of a rear fold-down seat, and the convertible was available with folding glass windows. Gone was the Rally-Pac, since the new instrument cluster had provisions for an optional tachometer and clock. Its size and shape also precluded the installation of the accessory atop the steering column. The convenience group with four warning lights for low fuel, seat belt reminder, parking brake not released, and door ajar were added to the instrument panel, or, if one ordered the optional console and A/C, the lights were mounted on the console.|$|R

It was {{designed}} to resemble the original flying helmet and it consisted of a leather skull <b>cap</b> <b>trimmed</b> with black rabbit fur. The helmet also featured an ostrich feather plume which was connected at an RAF badge. This helmet was never popular and junior officers were eventually permitted to wear the service dress hat on full dress occasions.|$|R

I've worked sometimes whole afternoons, <b>trimming</b> her <b>caps,</b> and getting her ready to go to a party. As to abuse, she don't know what it is. She never was whipped more than once or twice in her whole life. She has her strong coffee or her tea every day, with white sugar in it. It's abominable, to be sure; but St. Clare will have high life below-stairs, and they every one of them live just as they please. The fact is, our servants are over-indulged. I suppose it is partly our fault that they are selfish, and act like spoiled children; but I've talked to St. Clare till I am tired." ...|$|R

Larry Sterne was put to school at Halifax in England, finally was adopted by his kinsman of Elvington, and parted company with his father, the Captain, who marched on his path of life till he met the fatal goose, which closed his career. The most picturesque and delightful parts of Laurence Sterne’s writings, we owe to his recollections of the military life. <b>Trim’s</b> montero <b>cap,</b> and Le Fevre’s sword, and dear Uncle Toby’s roquelaure, are doubtless reminiscences of the boy, who had lived with the followers of William and Marlborough, and had beat time with his little feet to the fifes of Ramillies in Dublin barrack-yard, or played with the torn flags and halberds of Malplaquet on the parade-ground at Clonmel.|$|R
