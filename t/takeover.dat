40|$|A {{model of}} <b>takeovers</b> is {{investigated}} in which "noise trading" provides camouflage {{that makes it}} possible for a large corporate outsider to purchase enough shares at favorable prices so that <b>takeovers</b> become profitable. Although the model accommodates the possibility of dilution (Grossman and Hart, 1980) and a large incumbent shareholder (Shleifer and Vishny, 1986), neither dilution nor a large incumbent shareholder is necessary for costly <b>takeovers</b> to be profitable.

5|$|A {{declaration}} on the <b>takeover</b> of Prijedor by Serb forces {{was prepared}} by Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) politicians and was repeatedly read out on Radio Prijedor {{the day after}} the <b>takeover.</b> Four-hundred Bosnian Serb policemen were assigned to participate in the <b>takeover,</b> the objective of which was to seize the functions {{of the president of the}} municipality, the vice-president of the municipality, the director of the post office, the chief of the police, etc. On the night of the 29/30 April 1992, the <b>takeover</b> of power took place. Serb employees of the public security station and reserve police gathered in Cirkin Polje, part of the town of Prijedor. The people there were given the task of taking over power in the municipality and were broadly divided into five groups. Each group of about twenty had a leader and each was ordered to gain control of certain buildings. One group was responsible for the Assembly building, one for the main police building, one for the courts, one for the bank and the last for the post-office. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) concluded that the <b>takeover</b> by the Serb politicians was an illegal coup d'état, which was planned and coordinated long in advance with the ultimate aim of creating a pure Serbian municipality. These plans were never hidden and they were implemented in a coordinated action by the Serb police, army and politicians. One of the leading figures was Milomir Stakić, who came to play the dominant role in the political life of the municipality.|$|E

40|$|We examine post-takeover {{restructuring}} {{activity and}} the sources of gains in large U. S. targets of foreign acquirers. We find that layoffs and sell-offs are less important in justifying the target premium in foreign <b>takeovers</b> than in domestic <b>takeovers.</b> In contrast, U. S. targets in foreign <b>takeovers</b> subsequently make more post-takeover investments than those in domestic <b>takeovers.</b> The likelihood of these post-takeover restructuring activities is significantly influenced by target characteristics. Finally, the U. S. Tax Reform Act of 1986 has had a significant positive effect on target returns.

I employ a unique data set of 715 German <b>takeovers</b> to test whether group structure, large shareholders, and bank control affect their value to shareholders.

40|$|In Chinas state-dominated {{financial}} system, many firms, especially non-state-owned {{or private}} organizations, face serious restrictions in {{gaining access to}} bank and equity market financing. This kind of highly discriminatory financial repression policy has induced some unique post-takeover financing activities, which {{are consistent with the}} desire to acquire firms in order to capitalize on their privileges in getting access to external finance. Specifically, <b>takeovers</b> by acquirers facing more serious financing obstacles (private acquirers) tend to show less salient symptoms of tunneling and display patterns of more efficient investment than <b>takeovers</b> by acquirers suffering less serious financing obstacles (state acquirers). Market reaction analysis suggests that these <b>takeovers</b> pose different implications for acquirers shareholder value, with <b>takeovers</b> by private acquirers being viewed as value enhancing but <b>takeovers</b> by state acquirers being viewed as value reducing...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} real-options model of <b>takeovers</b> and {{investment}} in declining industries. Managers are assumed to maximize {{the present value of}} the cash flows that they can capture from the firm. The managers must pay out a minimum amount of cash to prevent investors from exercising their property rights and taking over the firm. As product demand declines, a first-best abandonment level is reached, where overall value is maximized by shutting down the firm and releasing its capital to investors. Absent <b>takeovers,</b> managers of unlevered firms always wait too long to shut down; they abandon the firm’s business too late. We model the managers’ payout policy absent <b>takeovers</b> and derive an optimal debt ratio, which enforces first-best abandonment decisions under plausible restrictions on equity issues. We analyze the effects of <b>takeovers</b> of unleveraged or under-leveraged firms. <b>Takeovers</b> by raiders enforce first-best abandonment. Hostile <b>takeovers</b> by other firms occur either at the first-best abandonment point or too early. We also consider management buyouts and mergers of equals and show that in both cases closure happens inefficiently late. JEL Nos. : G 34,C 72,G 13...|$|R

40|$|<b>Takeovers</b> of {{privately held}} {{companies}} represent more than 80 % of all <b>takeovers.</b> Despite their significance, studies of such <b>takeovers</b> {{and their impact}} on the wealth of shareholders are rare. Using a very large, near exhaustive, sample of listed and privately held UK targets we examine the impact of such <b>takeovers</b> on the risk adjusted return of listed UK acquirers over the period 1981 to 2001. Acquirers earn significant positive returns during the period surrounding the bid announcement although the gains are dependent on target status, mode of payment, and the relative size of those involved.

5|$|In September 1966, a {{friendly}} <b>takeover</b> of the Bradford brewers J. Hey & Company Ltd added 73 public houses to their estate. Webster's had a {{market value of}} £3.3million, and J. Hey had a value of £1million. The combined group had assets of over £4.5million (£65million in 2010 prices). Webster's continued to bottle Guinness under their Hey & Humphries subsidiary label into the late 1980s. Throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, consolidation, a good product and successful marketing made the company successful, according to The Times, with the social club trade accounted for around half of turnover. By 1967 Watney Mann owned 18.4 per cent of the company, and Webster's had a market capitalisation of £6million (£85million in 2010 prices) and owned 320 public houses and 12 off licences. Watney Mann had gradually increased their share to 27.1 per cent by 1972 when it initiated a <b>takeover</b> {{of the rest of}} the company. Samuel Webster & Sons was offered £18million for the 73 per cent of the company that Watney did not already own. The Watney Mann offer valued the entire company at almost £250million in 2010 prices. The <b>takeover</b> was {{a friendly}} one, and dependent upon the agreement of the Webster family, who owned 20 per cent of the company. Watney Mann was motivated by an increase to their tied estate. Following the <b>takeover,</b> Webster's continued as a regional subsidiary of the Watney Mann brewing empire, responsible for Yorkshire, Humberside, north Derbyshire and north Nottinghamshire. The <b>takeover</b> saw heavy investment in the brewery and the Webster's brands enjoyed increased distribution nationally. That same year, Watney Mann itself was taken over by Grand Metropolitan.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United was floated on {{the stock}} market in June 1991 (raising £6.7million), and {{received}} yet another <b>takeover</b> bid in 1998, this time from Rupert Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting Corporation. This resulted in the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch – now the Manchester United Supporters' Trust – who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any hostile <b>takeover.</b> The Manchester United board accepted a £623million offer, but the <b>takeover</b> was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission at the final hurdle in April 1999. A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the club's manager, Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, John Magnier and J. P. McManus, who had gradually become the majority shareholders. In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse Rock of Gibraltar, Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager, and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmen's majority.|$|E
