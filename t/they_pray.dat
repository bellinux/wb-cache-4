Its prayer carpet is angled {{towards the}} mosque's northwest corner, so worshippers can face Mecca while <b>they</b> <b>pray.</b> Devotees enter the mosque from the Islamic Centre, climbing several marble steps {{leading to the}} mosque balcony. The prayer hall below has a burgundy-coloured carpet, patterned with images resembling hot-water bottles which demarcate spaces for the believers offering prayers. The carpet can accommodate 1,372 people if each devotee occupies one space. The mosque has a reported capacity of 10,700 for Friday prayers.|$|E

In the first year, several strippers left the sex industry and began volunteering with the chapter. Many of the chapter's members do not personally visit strip clubs but help in other ways. Scher said the former strippers were the most effective JC's Girls volunteers because they understand from personal experience the situations of the women they are trying to help. By 2011, members of the San Diego chapter of JC's Girls were visiting strip clubs twice each month. <b>They</b> <b>pray</b> before, during, and after each visit and a team of other members pray for them from another location.|$|E

Conflict soon arises between Dahlan and the local kyais (religious leaders) after he shows that {{the direction in which}} <b>they</b> <b>pray</b> is wrong, pointing not to the Kaaba in Mecca but to Africa. The kyais, especially Cholil Kamaludiningrat (Slamet Rahardjo), decry Dahlan as the leader of a cult and provoke a crowd of their followers to destroy the building next to Dahlan's house used for studying prayer.|$|E

5|$|African {{tribes in}} several {{countries}} have termites as totems, {{and for this reason}} tribe members are forbidden to eat the reproductive alates. Termites are widely used in traditional popular medicine; they are used as treatments for diseases and other conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, hoarseness, influenza, sinusitis, tonsillitis and whooping cough. In Nigeria, Macrotermes nigeriensis is used for spiritual protection and to treat wounds and sick pregnant women. In Southeast Asia, termites are used in ritual practices. In Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, termite mounds are commonly worshiped among the populace. Abandoned mounds are viewed as structures created by spirits, believing a local guardian dwells within the mound; this is known as Keramat and Datok Kong. In urban areas, local residents construct red-painted shrines over mounds that have been abandoned, where <b>they</b> <b>pray</b> for good health, protection and luck.|$|E
25|$|Their {{royal family}} {{is of an}} old dynasty (see House of Munsö), but the kings are {{dependent}} on {{the will of the}} people (the Thing). What has been decided by the people is more important than the will of the king unless the king's opinion seems to be the most reasonable one, whereupon they usually obey. During peacetime, they feel to be the king's equals but during wars they obey him blindly or whoever among them that he considers to be the most skillful. If the fortunes of war are against them <b>they</b> <b>pray</b> to one of their many gods (Æsir) and if they win they are grateful to him.|$|E
25|$|The Augustinian, or Austin, friars (O.S.A.), are a mendicant order. As consecrated religious, <b>they</b> <b>pray</b> the Liturgy of the Hours {{throughout}} the day. This Latin Rite Order, while a contemplative Order, differs from traditional monastic Orders in three ways: 1) They {{do not take}} vows of stability, meaning that they can live in one house (called a friary or sometimes a monastery) typically for several years before being moved into a different community of the Order. 2) They are engaged in apostolic activity, such as mission work, education, prison ministries, etc. The Order is {{under the supervision of}} a Prior General in Rome, and as an international Order they are divided into various Provinces {{throughout the}} world, with each Province being led by a Prior Provincial; (3) As an Order, they have a special commitment to corporate poverty as opposed to simply the poverty professed by the individual friar. While this is not currently legislated {{as it was in the}} origins of the Order, this is to be a distinguishing mark of their lives as a community.|$|E

25|$|Being a hub of {{waterway}} transport, Tuen Mun attracted fishermen {{communities in}} the ancient times. The fishermen wished to enjoy the protection and blessings of the heavenly goddess Tin Hau and built a temple at Hau Kok in Kau Hui to worship her and pray for safety. During the Ming Dynasty, the To clansmen, who were engaged in the salt business, migrated to Tuen Mun. They developed close ties with local fishermen and worked together {{for the expansion of}} the Temple. People living in the walled villages also helped in financing its renovation on a number of occasions. The Temple has always been well patronised by worshippers. During the Tin Hau Festival (i.e. the 23rd day of the third month in the Chinese calendar) every year, villagers and fishermen hold a series of celebrations in the open space in front of the temple. <b>They</b> <b>pray</b> for prosperity and peace by staging thanksgiving opera performances as well as dragon and lion dances. Every year, Lunar New Year fair will be organised in the square in front of Tin Hau Temple. Besides, it is also a place for earthen pot gathering.|$|E

In France, Brethren have established a central committee offering leadership and direction to assemblies that choose to participate, despite the common Brethren aversion to central organizations, while Brethren in Ethiopia have leadership conferences at which some collective decision-making takes place. In Germany, many Brethren assemblies have joined Wiedenest, a joint Brethren-Baptist venture which operates a seminary, conference centre, youth movement, and missionary organization.
