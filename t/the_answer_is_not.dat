25|$|The graph {{isomorphism}} {{problem is}} the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic. An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in P, NP-complete, or NP-intermediate. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known, but {{it is believed that}} the problem is at least not NP-complete. If graph isomorphism is NP-complete, the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level. Since it is widely believed that the polynomial hierarchy does not collapse to any finite level, it is believed that graph isomorphism is not NP-complete. The best algorithm for this problem, due to László Babai and Eugene Luks, has run time 2O(√nlog(n)) for graphs with n vertices.|$|E

The idea of cultural openness is illustrated by the character of Tirio Actamo: once a well-known citizen of Ansul who was taken to be the concubine of the Gand, she then wins his love and uses her position to bring about an end to the conflict. Scholar Marek Oziewicz identified the story as critiquing the notion of retributive justice, considered the norm in Western societies, and instead supporting the idea of restorative justice. The protagonists of Voices succeed in [...] "making things right" [...] without punitive action. According to Oziewicz, the central question of the story is one that Memer asks the Oracle: [...] "How can we be free of the Alds?" [...] <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a bloody revolution, but a compromise, possible because both parties are willing to recognize and end the conflict.

500|$|The novel's format, {{its various}} {{multiple}} sources, its manipulation of linear time and its inclusion of supernatural elements (talking dogs and meteor rifles, for example) all serve to deconstruct {{the idea of}} absolute power, by creating an ambiguity between fact and myth, between Dr Francia and the Supreme, and between Roa Bastos and the Compiler. Francia places himself above all power and history: [...] "I don't write history. I make it. I can remake it as I please, adjusting, stressing, enriching its meaning and truth." [...] Yet in the Compiler's notes and retelling of events, the novel {{is presented as a}} genuine version of history, one that contradicts and questions the Supreme's. In their collectivity, they deny the illusion of absolute power, whether the power is that of Francia the dictator or Roa Bastos the writer. This ambiguity between myth and fact is elaborated on {{at the end of the}} novel in the fictional debate over the Supreme's remains; it questions the nature of national political myth, and how heroes and villains are created in it and where the Supreme falls into those categories after being portrayed as both by Roa Bastos. As Deiner poses the question raised by the novel, [...] "Is he to be portrayed as a valiant leader who held the country together in the face of enormous external aggression, or as a despot who laid the basis for almost two centuries of exploitation of Paraguay’s peoples by its leaders?"
