They even dismantled parts of the Eritrean Railway system.|$|E

25|$|For Merezhkovsky the October Socialist {{revolution}} was a catastrophe. He {{saw it as}} the Coming of Ham he wrote about a decade later, the tragic victory for, as he choose to put it, Narod-Zver (The Beast-nation), {{the political and social}} incarnation of the universal Evil, putting the whole human civilization to danger. Merezhkovsky and Gippius tried to use whatever influence they retained upon the Bolshevist cultural leaders to ensure the release of their friends, the arrested Provisional government ministers. Ironically, one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> Soviet government did was lift the ban from anti-monarchist Pavel Pervy play and it was staged in several Red Russia's theaters.|$|E
25|$|After Arthur {{has taken}} {{each of the}} seven keys, and the will becomes fulfilled, a huge wave of Nothing dissolves the Incomparable Gardens, Lord Sunday's domain, and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> Architect created. This causes the whole of {{creation}} to be destroyed with it including all of the secondary realms (including Earth). Arthur regains consciousness in the void of Nothing (as he holds the power of all seven keys, he is unable to be destroyed unless he so wishes), and he meets the Architect, who is revealed to be the Old One and the Will, once split into two parts to govern the house and the secondary realms respectively. When the Architect and the Old One fell out, the Architect chained the Old One eternally. Doing this meant that she could not return to Nothing when she wished, as she had to go as one. The only way to release the Old One was to destroy creation. These terms were laid out in the will.|$|E
25|$|Arnaz {{appeared}} in several {{movies in the}} 1940s such as Bataan (1943). He received his draft notice, but before reporting, he injured his knee. He completed his recruit training, but was classified for limited service in the United States Army during World War II. He was assigned to direct United Service Organization (U.S.O.) programs at a military hospital in the San Fernando Valley. Discovering <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> wounded soldiers requested was a glass of cold milk, he arranged for movie starlets to meet them and pour the milk for them. Following his discharge from the Army, he formed another orchestra, which was successful in live appearances and recordings. He sang for troops in Birmingham Hospital with John Macchia and hired his childhood friend Marco Rizo to play piano and arrange for the orchestra. When he became successful in television, he kept the orchestra on his payroll, and Rizo arranged and orchestrated the music for I Love Lucy.|$|E

500|$|Mike Scully, {{who worked}} as an {{executive}} producer and show runner for the episode, stated in the episode's DVD audio commentary that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> writers {{tried to think of}} while writing the episode was how the Simpson family would fit into the story. In the episode's first draft, Gloria worked as a food truck driver; however, this was later changed so that she instead worked as a police lady. Scully also stated that, in the scene after Homer carries Burns and Gloria up the stairs, there were originally a lot of jokes about Homer [...] "taking care of business" [...] for Burns; however, the staff decided to leave it out since it would make Homer [...] "unlikable." [...] In the episode, Snake Jailbird's mailbox reads [...] "Snake (Jailbird)" [...] which is a reference to a debate that the writers had over whether Snake's mailbox would read [...] "Snake" [...] or [...] "Jailbird". Originally, the episode would end with Burns taking the [...] "pocket fox" [...] extract, however when seeing the animatic, the writers felt that that ending would be [...] "too slow", so they changed it into Gloria falling in love with Snake again.|$|E
500|$|Choosing a {{name for}} the game was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> team did before {{starting}} development. They decided on the name Sunset Overdrive because they felt it was unique, and captured the feeling of the [...] "grindhouse" [...] from the 1970s. The project was originally conceived as an open world survival game similar to DayZ. The initial version of the game did not feature the traversal system, nor the unusual weapons included in the final version, and was described as [...] "grounded" [...] by Murray. In this version, players were tasked with scavenging resources during daytime, and defending their base at night. This later evolved to become the game's cooperative multiplayer mode. It employed the animation model from Insomniac's previous game, Fuse. The direction of the game changed after the team watched a video based on Gorillaz, and Murray gave up the idea of a realistic survival game. He then asked the team to start prototyping ideas for a game that they thought would work. Some team members {{came up with the idea}} of having skateboarding elements in the game, which led the development team to start working and experimenting with a new traversal system. In hindsight, Murray described the shift in focus as an [...] "organic, evolutionary process". As the game's development progressed, the team began to draw on elements from other video game franchises such as Prince of Persia, Jet Set Radio, and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, and put the emphasis on momentum.|$|E
2500|$|In Flora Fountain, {{vehicles}} carrying mail {{were stopped}} and the mail burnt. British men and women going in cars and victorias were made to get down and shout [...] "Jai Hind" [...] (Victory to India). Guns were trained on the Taj Mahal Hotel, the Yacht Club and other buildings from morning till evening. After {{the outbreak of the}} mutiny, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> mutineers did was to free B.C. Dutt (who was arrested during General Auchinleck’s visit). Then they took possession of Butcher Island (where the entire ammunition meant for Bombay Presidency was stocked).|$|E

The mutineers then removed the official military tribunes loyal to Rome, {{and replaced them with}} their own ringleaders. They proceeded to plunder the towns and areas around the Sucro fort. In addition they removed the normal Roman military insignias and replaced them with the insignia of fasces and axes (a symbol of death).|$|R
50|$|When Kansas was {{admitted}} to the United States in 1861, one of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>the</b> new state Legislature planned to do was to establish a state university.

2500|$|His {{older brother}} succeeded Lê Túc Tông as Lê Uy Mục. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> new emperor {{did was to}} take revenge against those who had [...] barred him from the throne by having them killed. [...] Among his victims were the former emperor's mother – which was {{considered}} a shocking display of evil behavior. Lê Uy Mục {{was described as a}} cruel, sadistic, and depraved person, who wasted the court's money and finances to indulge his whims. Well aware that he was detested by his subjects, Lê Uy Mục protected himself by hiring a group of elite bodyguards to surround him at all times. Among them was Mạc Đăng Dung, who became very close to the emperor and eventually rose to the rank of general. Despite his precautions, in 1509 a cousin, whom Lê Uy Mục had put in prison, escaped and plotted with court insiders to assassinate the emperor. The assassination succeeded and the killer proclaimed himself emperor under the name Lê Tương Dực.|$|E

2500|$|The {{whole process}} unravels when H arrives {{at its own}} number K. We will proceed with our example. Suppose the successful-tally/record R stands at 12. H finally arrives at its own number minus 1, i.e. N = K-1 = 4335...3214, and this number is unsuccessful. Then H {{increments}} N to produce K = 4355...3215, i.e. its own number. H converts this to “LDDR...DCAR” and passes it to decision-machine D. Decision-machine D must return “satisfactory” (that is: H must by definition {{go on and on}} testing, ad infinitum, because it is [...] "circle-free"). So H now increments tally R from 12 to 13 and then re-converts the number-under-test K into its S.D and uses U to simulate it. But this means that H will be simulating its own motions. What is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> simulation will do? This simulation K-aka-H either creates a new N or “resets” the “old” N to 1. This [...] "K-aka-H" [...] either creates a new R or “resets” the “old” R to 0. Old-H “runs” new [...] "K-aka-H" [...] until it arrives at its 12th figure.|$|E
2500|$|One {{afternoon}} in August 1913, Captain Bucey {{was attempting to}} run the BC Express through the Grand Canyon {{when he realized that}} the current was particularly strong in the whirlpool. Bucey decided that it would be necessary to line the sternwheeler through the canyon, and was pulling over to the side when a [...] spruce tree, complete with root structure, appeared {{on the surface of the}} whirlpool and swept under the BC Express, jamming against her three main rudders. Though Bucey had lost his main method of steering, he was still able to use the steamer's paddlewheel to maneuver backwards through the canyon, where he would eventually come to a place along the shore where he could tie up and his crew could disembark and remove the tree and check for damages. Most of his passengers, knowing Bucey's skillful reputation, were untroubled by the BC Express's plight, but one man panicked and raced across the bow and leapt onto the canyon wall, where he was left clinging 6 feet above the whirlpool. Unable to do anything for the passenger, Bucey had to continue downstream, where half an hour later he was able to tie up. After landing, Bucey's first thought was for his stranded passenger, and he sent out a rescue party of three men, led by AK Bouchier, the BC Express Company's agent at Tête Jaune Cache. The men walked back up the canyon and were relieved and astonished to find the man still clinging to the canyon wall, 70 feet below them. One of the rescuers was lowered down with a rope, and the passenger was hauled up to safety. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>the</b> rescued man did was check his pockets for two small leather bags he was carrying, both full of diamond rings that he peddled along the new rail towns to brothels and private buyers. Once assured that his precious diamonds were safe, he was taken back to his berth on the BC Express and given a stiff scotch.|$|E
