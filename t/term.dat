5|$|As {{the result}} of a 2015 {{referendum}} in Houston, a mayor is elected for a four-year <b>term,</b> and can be elected to as many as two consecutive terms. The <b>term</b> limits were spearheaded in 1991 by conservative political activist Clymer Wright. During 1991–2015, the city controller and city council members were subjected to a two-year, three-term limitation – the 2015 referendum amended <b>term</b> limits to two four-year terms. As of 2017 some councilmembers who served two terms and won a final <b>term</b> will have served eight years in office, whereas a freshman councilmember who won a position in 2013 can serve up to two additional terms under the previous <b>term</b> limit law – a select few will have at least 10 years of incumbency once their <b>term</b> expires.|$|E

5|$|The {{office of}} {{governor}} {{was established by}} the first New York State Constitution in 1777. The governor was originally for a <b>term</b> of three years, though the constitution did not specify when the <b>term</b> began. A 1787 law set {{the start of the}} <b>term</b> at July 1. The New York State Constitutional Convention of 1821 amended the state constitution, reducing the <b>term</b> of office to two years, moving the election to November, and moving {{the beginning and the end}} of the <b>term</b> to coincide with the calendar year. An 1874 amendment extended the <b>term</b> of office back to three years, but the 1894 constitution again reduced it to two years. The most recent constitution of 1938 extended the <b>term</b> to the current four years. There is no limit to the number of consecutive terms a governor may serve.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} California Constitution of 1849 {{called for}} elections every two years, with no set start {{date for the}} <b>term.</b> An amendment ratified in 1862 increased the <b>term</b> to four years, and the 1879 constitution set the <b>term</b> to begin on the first Monday in January following an election. In 1990, Proposition 140 led to a constitutional amendment implementing a <b>term</b> limit of two terms; prior to this limit, only one governor, Earl Warren, served more than two terms. Jerry Brown {{was able to be}} elected to a third <b>term</b> in 2010 because his previous terms were before the <b>term</b> limit was enacted. The 1849 constitution also created the office of lieutenant governor, who, in cases of vacancy in the office of governor, becomes governor.

40|$|Numerical {{processing}} {{has been}} demonstrated to be subserved typically by the brain regions around the bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS). The goal {{of the current study}} was to investigate whether the processing of mathematical <b>terms</b> shared the same brain regions with numerical processing. Healthy adult participants performed semantic distance judgment tasks on five types of materials, including geometric <b>terms,</b> algebraic <b>terms,</b> linguistic <b>terms,</b> words for tools and other common objects, and Arabic numbers. Brain activation was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The results showed that geometric <b>terms</b> had greater activation than algebraic <b>terms,</b> linguistic <b>terms</b> and tool words in the horizontal IPS, but algebraic <b>terms</b> did not have greater activation than linguistic <b>terms</b> and tool words in this region. Arabic numbers showed greater activation than non-number materials (including geometric <b>terms,</b> algebraic <b>terms,</b> linguistic <b>terms</b> and tool words) in the bilateral IPS, right inferior frontal gyrus and bilateral middle frontal gyrus, but the non-number materials showed stronger activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus. These results suggest that the brain area for the processing of numbers (the left IPS) seems to be involved in semantic processing of geometric <b>terms,</b> but not that of other mathematical <b>terms</b> such as algebraic <b>terms.</b> Both algebraic and geometric <b>terms</b> share similar brain organization with basic semantic processing in the left temporal and frontal regions. © 2011 Elsevier Inc...|$|R
