40|$|A {{challenge}} {{in the development of}} renewable energy is the ability to spatially assess the risk of feedstock supply to <b>conversion</b> <b>facilities.</b> Policy makers and investors need improved methods to identify the interactions associated with landscape features, socioeconomic conditions, and ownership patterns, and the influence these variables have on the geographic location of potential <b>conversion</b> <b>facilities.</b> This study estimated opportunity zones for woody cellulosic feedstocks based on landscape suitability and market competition for the resource. The study covered 13 Southern States which was a segment of a broader study that covered 33 Eastern United States which also included agricultural biomass. All spatial data were organized at the 5 -digit zip code tabulation area (ZCTA). A landscape index was developed using factors such as forest land cover area, net forest growth, ownership type, population density, median family income, and farm income. A competition index was developed based on the annual growth-to-removal ratio and capacities of existing woody cellulosic <b>conversion</b> <b>facilities.</b> Combining the indices resulted in the identification of 592 ZCTAs that were considered highly desirable zones for woody cellulosic <b>conversion</b> <b>facilities.</b> These highly desirable zones were located in Central Mississippi, Northern Arkansas, South central Alabama, Southwest Georgia, Southeast Oklahoma, Southwest Kentucky, and Northwest Tennessee...|$|R

40|$|High {{logistics}} {{and handling}} costs prevent the bioenergy industry {{from making a}} greater contribution to the present energy market. Therefore, a mathematical model, OPTIMASS, is presented to optimise strategic (e. g. facility location and type) and tactical (e. g. allocation) decisions {{in all kinds of}} biomass-based supply chains. In addition to existing models, OPTIMASS evaluates changes in biomass characteristics due to handling operations which is needed to meet the requirements set to biomass products delivered at a <b>conversion</b> <b>facility.</b> Also, OPTIMASS considers the re-injection of by-products from <b>conversion</b> <b>facilities</b> which can play a decisive role in the determination of a sustainable supply chain. The scenario analysis illustrates the functionalities of OPTIMASS in the optimisation of an existing supply chain, the definition of the optimal location of new <b>conversion</b> <b>facilities</b> and the definition of the optimal configuration of a supply chain. OPTIMASS, as a deterministic model, does not consider variability related to e. g. seasonal changes which can be a major obstacle. However, a thorough sensitivity analysis of influencing factors must give insight in the induced changes in the supply chain. The sensitivity analysis in this paper investigates the influence of uncertainty in biomass production, energy demand and of changes in transport distance. The analysis demonstrate that OPTIMASS can be used as an inspiring tool to investigate the possible effects of governmental decisions, of considering new biomass material, new facilities, of technology changes, etc. The coupling with GIS allows characterisation and visualisation of problems in advance and visualisation of results in an interpretative way. status: publishe...|$|R
