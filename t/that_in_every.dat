Watts informs Black that a Group member, Olson, has been tasked with {{monitoring}} Butler since her release. Watts and Black travel to Butler's {{last known address}} and find Olson's long-dead body. They realize Butler had been filing her own surveillance reports in Olson's name. Meanwhile, Bryce attempts to escape, but is subdued and later comforted by Lucy Butler. Black interviews Roe, suspecting her involvement when she continually refers to Bryce in the past tense. He later discovers <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>every</b> school she has worked for, students have been kidnapped; all the victims resembled Bryce in being average students who showed signs of promise.|$|E

Chabad followers also pointed to a tradition <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>every</b> generation there is one person who is considered the Messiah of the generation.|$|E

60|$|The {{result of}} his effort may be summed up as follows: Thackeray is a novelist for the few who can enjoy his {{accurate}} but petty views of society, and his cultivated prose style. He is not very cheerful; he does not seek the blue flower <b>that</b> grows <b>in</b> <b>every</b> field, or the gold that is at every rainbow's end, or the romance <b>that</b> hides <b>in</b> <b>every</b> human heart whether of rich or poor. Therefore are the young not conspicuous among his followers.|$|R
25|$|Ajivikas {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>every</b> {{being there}} is a soul (Atman). However, unlike Jains and various orthodox schools of Hinduism that held that soul is formless, Ajivikas asserted that soul has a material form, one that helps meditation. They also believed that the soul passes through many births and ultimately progresses unto its pre-destined nirvana (salvation). Basham states, that some texts suggest evidence of Vaishnavism-type devotional practices among some Ajivikas.|$|E

The Chiefs scored more than 10 points just twice in their first six games, but scored more offensive points than <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>every</b> game since, and twice topped 25 points.

The most important early account of its composition, the Iggeret Rav Sherira Gaon (Epistle of Rabbi Sherira Gaon) is ambiguous on the point, although the Spanish recension leans to {{the theory that the}} Mishnah was written. However, the Talmud records <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>every</b> study session, there was a person called the tanna appointed to recite the Mishnah passage under discussion. This may indicate that, even if the Mishnah was reduced to writing, it was not available on general distribution.|$|E
25|$|The Ājīvika {{school is}} known for its Niyati ("Fate") {{doctrine}} of absolute determinism, the premise that there is no free will, that everything that has happened, is happening and will happen is entirely preordained and a function of cosmic principles. Ājīvikas considered the karma doctrine as a fallacy. Ajivika metaphysics included a theory of atoms similar to the Vaisheshika school, where everything was composed of atoms, qualities emerged from aggregates of atoms, but the aggregation and nature of these atoms was predetermined by cosmic forces. Ājīvikas were atheists and rejected the authority of the Vedas, but they believed <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>every</b> living being is an ātman – a central premise of Hinduism and Jainism.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} Tikkun olam (Repairing the World) {{is central to}} modern Rabbinic Judaism. Tikkun olam is {{accomplished}} through various means, such as ritualistically performing God's commandments, charity and social justice, {{as well as through}} example persuading {{the rest of the world}} to behave morally. According to some views, Tikkun Olam would result in the beginning of the Messianic Age. It has been said <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>every</b> generation, a person is born with the potential to be the spiritual Messiah. If the time is right for the Messianic Age within that person's lifetime, then that person will be the mashiach. But if that person dies before he completes the mission of the Messiah, then that person is not the Messiah (Mashiach).|$|E

25|$|Mock bombardments of {{imaginary}} shore {{positions were}} carried out by Prince David in Saanich Inlet, and equally imaginary shore batteries fired back, while movie raiders rowed the ship's boats ashore {{as hard as they}} could. A ship-handling problem peculiar to this operation was <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>every</b> scene where Prince David was to appear herself, she could present only her starboard side to the camera. It was calculated that cinema-goers would not likely accept the huge sound truck that had been hoisted aboard, and reposed on the weather deck port side, as a regular item in Combined Operations weaponry. The ship's company co-operated heartily, and kept up a high standard of discipline and war-readiness despite the distractions of this fling with film fame, and the glitter of hob-nobbing with the film famous.|$|E
25|$|Magnus Hirschfeld {{argued that}} adult sexual {{orientation}} {{can be explained}} in terms of the bisexual nature of the developing fetus: he believed <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>every</b> embryo there is one rudimentary neutral center for attraction to males and another for attraction to females. In most fetuses, the center for attraction to the opposite sex developed while the center for attraction to the same sex regressed, but in fetuses that became homosexual, the reverse occurred. Simon LeVay has criticized Hirschfeld's theory of an early bisexual stage of development, calling it confusing; LeVay maintains that Hirschfeld failed to distinguish between saying that the brain is sexually undifferentiated at an early stage of development and saying that an individual actually experiences sexual attraction to both men and women. According to LeVay, Hirschfeld believed that in most bisexual people the strength of attraction to the same sex was relatively low, and that it was therefore possible to restrain its development in young people, something Hirschfeld supported.|$|E
25|$|Wilfred Bion's {{observations}} {{about the role}} of group processes in group dynamics are set out in Experiences in Groups and other papers, written in the 1940s but compiled and published in 1961, where he refers to recurrent emotional states of groups as 'basic assumptions'. Bion argues <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>every</b> group, two groups are actually present: the work group, and the basic assumption group. The work group is that aspect of group functioning which {{has to do with the}} primary task of the group—what the group has formed to accomplish; will 'keep the group anchored to a sophisticated and rational level of behaviour'. The basic assumption group describes the tacit underlying assumptions on which the behaviour of the group is based. Bion specifically identified three basic assumptions: dependency, fight-flight, and pairing. When a group adopts any one of these basic assumptions, it interferes with the task the group is attempting to accomplish. Bion believed that interpretation by the therapist of this aspect of group dynamics would, whilst being resisted, also result in potential insight regarding effective, co-operative group work.|$|E
