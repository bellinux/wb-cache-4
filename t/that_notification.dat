500|$|Reviews of iOS 10 {{were mostly}} positive. Reviewers {{highlighted}} the significant updates to iMessage, Siri, Photos, 3D Touch, and the lock screen as welcome changes. The third-party extension support to iMessage meant it was [...] "becoming a platform", although the user interface {{was criticized for}} being difficult to understand. Third-party integration in Siri was [...] "great", although the voice assistant was criticized for not having become smarter than before. Reviewers were impressed with the image recognition technology in Photos, although noting {{it was still a}} [...] "work in progress" [...] with a higher error rate than the competition. 3D Touch [...] "finally feels useful" [...] and [...] "works in almost every part of the OS". The lock screen was [...] "far more customizable than before", and reviewers enjoyed <b>that</b> <b>notification</b> bubbles could be expanded to see more information without needing to unlock the phone.|$|E
500|$|In his review, The Verges Dieter Bohn {{wrote that}} the new {{features}} introduced in iOS 10 are [...] "an evolution {{of some of the}} design and interaction ideas that Apple has been working on for a couple of years". He wrote that iMessage is [...] "becoming a platform all its own", and although he liked that extensions mean access to information from apps without needing to open the respective apps, he wrote that new iMessage interface is difficult to understand and that the use of [...] "third-party apps, stickers, crazy confetti effects, and emoji all over the place" [...] is a [...] "nightmare", although finishing with [...] "Or maybe that's a wonderland, not a nightmare. Your call." [...] Regarding third-party support in Siri, he called it [...] "great", while noting the limited class of apps ("calls, messaging, payments, photos, ride-sharing apps, some CarPlay systems, and workouts"), and that sometimes a button press was required to complete the process. Beyond app integrations, he criticized Siri, writing [...] "Siri doesn't seem to have gotten a whole lot smarter than you remember". Bohn enjoyed the new machine learning technology present in the Photos app, writing that he was [...] "impressed" [...] by Apple's image recognition technology, which he noted is done locally on the device, but did criticize the error rate, where he compares the technology to Google Photos as a step ahead. Bohn liked the new designs for the Music and Maps apps, saying both the redesigns were [...] "for the better". Bohn particularly enjoyed the new lock screen, where he highlighted <b>that</b> <b>notification</b> bubbles can be 3D Touch-ed to access more information, all without needing to unlock the phone. Other small bits of new features he liked included [...] "deletable" [...] apps, upgraded [...] "widgets" [...] when 3D Touch-ing a home screen icon, and breaking news notifications in Apple News. Overall, Bohn referred to iOS 10 as [...] "Still a walled garden, but with more doors".|$|E

40|$|Background The {{trend towards}} hospitalist {{medicine}} {{can lead to}} disjointed patient care. Outpatient clinicians may be unaware of patients’ encounters with a disparate healthcare system. Electronic notifications to outpatient clinicians of patients’ emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient admissions and discharges using health information exchange can inform outpatient clinicians of patients’ hospital-based events. Objective Assess outpatient clinicians’ impressions of a new, secure messaging-based, patient event notification system. Methods Twenty outpatient clinicians receiving notifications of hospital-based events were recruited and 14 agreed to participate. Using a semi-structured interview, clinicians were asked about their use of notifications and the impact on their practices. Results Nine of 14 interviewed clinicians (64 %) thought <b>that</b> without <b>notifications,</b> they would have heard about fewer than 10 % of ED visits before the patient’s next visit. Nine clinicians (64 %) thought <b>that</b> without <b>notifications,</b> they would have heard about fewer than 25 % of inpatient admissions and discharges before the patient’s next visit. Six clinicians (43 %) reported that they call the inpatient team more often because of notifications. Eight users (57 %) thought <b>that</b> <b>notifications</b> improved patient safety by increasing their awareness of the patients’ clinical events and their medication changes. Key themes identified were the importance of workflow integration and a desire for more clinical information in notifications. Conclusions The notification system is perceived by clinicians to be of value. These findings should instigate further message-oriented use of health information exchange and point to refinements {{that can lead to}} even greater benefits. </p...|$|R
