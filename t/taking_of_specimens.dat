The <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> <b>specimens</b> for this trade appears to be the principal threat to this species.It is also threatened by pollution and by the damming of the rivers it occurs in which may prevent the fish from migrating to its spawning areas during the periods of flooding, as well as increasing sedimentation and causing habitat degradation.

The <b>specimens</b> are, however, damaged during the time <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> photograph by various factors such as heat, dryness, light etc. For the investigations of this kind, the most important requirement for preservation of protoplasmic structure is to interrupt the dynamic process of the cell as prompt as possible and to stabilize the structure with a minimum of change.

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} and treatment of diseases of the small intestine have been impeded by difficult technical challenges. Traditionally, endoscopic evaluation of this organ has required open laparotomy with the surgically assisted passage of the scope through the intestine. Nonsurgical endoscopic techniques have been developed, including push enteroscopy, passage of a scope over a guide-string, and a method that depends on peristalsis to advance the instrument, but each of these is subject to severe limitations. A novel procedure has been devised, whereby an endoscope and a soft flexible overtube, each of which has an inflatable balloon attached to its distal end, are employed together. The technique is described in detail in the present article. Double-balloon enteroscopy allows visualization of the entire small intestine, to and fro examination of an area of interest, and the <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> biopsy <b>specimens</b> {{in a manner that is}} safer, quicker and less painful than previous techniques.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the effect of supine posture alone on the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) in children with asthma, 22 children with asthma of varying severity had PEFR readings taken in the standing position and subsequently at 30 minute intervals in the supine position for a period of up to four hours. In order to minimise any stress factors no other procedures [...] for example, <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> blood <b>specimens</b> [...] were performed during the duration of the tests, which were carried out in a relatively dust free room with no curtains and minimal furniture. Fifteen non-asthmatic children acted as controls. The results showed a significant drop in the PEFR readings in the supine position in asthmatic children compared with the controls; this reverted back to baseline levels on assuming an upright posture {{at the end of the}} test without any medication. It is concluded that airflow obstruction can be induced by supine posture per se in asthmatic children; this may be a major factor contributing to nocturnal wheeze or cough...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} a simple, economical, and highly practical technique for <b>taking</b> digital photographs <b>of</b> <b>specimens</b> visualized through a light microscope. Most models of light microscope and compact digital camera, {{and even some}} cameraphones, can be used. The technique is quick to learn and can easily be performed in a resource-poor setting.

Obtaining images <b>of</b> clinical <b>specimens</b> viewed by a microscope can be invaluable for both diagnosis and teaching. Photography by a microscope normally requires a specially adapted microscope with a camera port, a camera with removable lens system, and an adapter to attach the camera to the port. 1 This equipment is prohibitively expensive for many laboratories, especially in the developing world. The advent of affordable compact digital cameras with displays that reflect precisely the image as seen through the camera lens has made possible a simplified method <b>of</b> <b>taking</b> photographs through a microscope.

40|$|Uniaxial {{characterization}} {{experiments in}} tension and compression {{are widely used}} to evaluate the mechanical response of materials to applied deformation over a wide range of strain rates. By <b>taking</b> photographs <b>of</b> the <b>specimen</b> as it deforms, it is possible to more fully characterize materials by reconstructing the specimen shape during the deformation process. This allows us to better evaluate the stress and strain in the specimen during deformation, and also provides a more rigorous validation of material models. For many materials, specimens with initially circular cross sections will evolve to a different shape; in particular, hcp metals become elliptical. We have developed a technique whereby images <b>of</b> a <b>specimen</b> during deformation (for example, from a high speed camera) from three different angles are used to reconstruct elliptical cross sections during an experiment.

In the capitulum the chief distinctive characters are--the more perfect graduation in size, and the greater number, (<b>taking</b> equal-sized <b>specimens,)</b> <b>of</b> the whorls of latera--the darker colours--the central part of the basal margin of the carina in this species, being considerably excised--the peculiar form of the basal margin of the scuta--and lastly, the scutal margin of the terga being more hollowed out.

50|$|William Bartram was a Quaker {{and the son}} of naturalist John Bartram. In 1772 Dr. John Fothergill of London {{commissioned}} William Bartram {{to explore}} the Florida territories, collecting seeds, making drawings, and <b>taking</b> <b>specimens</b> <b>of</b> unfamiliar plants. Bartram sailed from Philadelphia in March 1773, explored Georgia, and began exploring East Florida in March 1774, especially the St. Johns River and the Alachua Savanna peopled by Seminole Indians. Returning to Charleston, Bartram set out for the southern Appalachians and the Cherokee country in April 1775, unaware that war had broken out in New England. Bartram crossed the Chattahoochee River into what later became the state of Alabama, then traveled to Mobile and Pensacola. Despite illness, he continued his journey west along the Gulf coast and up the Mississippi River beyond Baton Rouge. Sailing again to Mobile, he traveled inland late in the year to the Creek Indian settlements on the Tallapoosa River. In January 1776 Bartram returned to Georgia, shipped the last <b>of</b> his plant <b>specimens</b> to London from Savannah, and returned home to Philadelphia.

Specifically, it said that the Fundación had learned of the discovery through third parties in October 2008. Attempts to agree on a publication authored by Carantón and members of Fundación ProAves failed, and then Carantón and others tried to publish a description of the species in the journal The Condor without notifying the Fundación. The Condor rejected the manuscript pending resolution of the dispute. Staff members of Fundación ProAves went to the Colibrí del Sol reserve and in January 2010 caught a bird whose feathers they collected and used as the basis of their publication without Carantón (May 2010).|$|R

40|$|In a {{prospective}} study, {{the effects of}} elevation surgery of the maxillary sinus floor on maxillary sinus physiology were assessed. Seventeen consecutive patients without preoperative anamnestic, clinical and radiological signs of maxillary sinusitis underwent sinus floor elevation surgery with iliac crest bone grafts. All patients were subjected to unilateral endoscopic examination of the maxillary sinus, <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> a biopsy <b>specimen</b> from the sinus floor mucosa, and collection of a sinus lavage-fluid aspirate. This triad of evaluations was performed immediately preceding the elevation procedure, and 3 months (at implant insertion) and 9 months (at uncovering of implants) postoperatively. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia. Preoperatively, three out of 17 patients showed pre-existing mucosal pathology endoscopically, while the 3 - and 9 -month results revealed the presence of mucosal pathology in four and two patients, respectively. The 3 -month microbiological evaluation showed {{a significant increase in}} cultures with bacterial growth, while the 9 -month culture results were comparable to the preoperative status of the maxillary sinus. Morphologically, neither fibrosis nor an altered inflammatory response or thickening of the epithelium and lamina propria was observed postoperatively.
