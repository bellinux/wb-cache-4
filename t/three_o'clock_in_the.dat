5|$|Hundreds of Iowa {{children}} were left homeless by the Civil War. On November 16, 1865, the Iowa Soldiers' Orphans' Home (renamed the Annie Wittenmyer Home in 1949) was opened. The first 150 children arrived from Keokuk, Iowa. Starting in 1876, children from broken homes {{as well as}} orphans from all of Iowa's ninety-nine counties were taken in at the home. The home was a self-contained community, containing residences, a school, tailor shop, and a chapel. The home had three separate fires during its course. On November 9, 1887, at <b>three</b> <b>o’clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, the third fire started. The building burnt to the ground. The next day’s Morning Democrat Gazette pointed out that if home was not set up with several different buildings as houses, all 350 children at the time would have been homeless, and some may have not survived the fire. After 110 years of service, the home closed in 1975. It is estimated that well over 12,000 {{children were}} helped by the Home during its operation.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{made one}} hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the {{government}} to do a full scale experiment of producing rain. The balloons were 10, 12, and 20 feet in diameter. The purpose of the Texas experiment was to see if making artificial rain could be done by man-made weather modification. After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that rain was made to fall two days before at <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon. At the time the sky was clear and there was no prediction of rain in the area for at least a week. The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet. That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing rain in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} rain and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|E

Only those who were circumcised and clean before the Law might participate, and they were forbidden to have leavened food in their possession during the act of killing the paschal lamb. The animal was slain {{on the eve of}} the Passover, on the afternoon of the 14th of Nisan, after the Tamid sacrifice had been killed, i.e., at <b>three</b> <b>o'clock,</b> or, <b>in</b> case <b>the</b> eve of the Passover fell on Friday, at two.|$|R
50|$|Girish {{came into}} much grief {{in his family}} life and became a staunch atheist until he met Ramakrishna Paramhansa. In his {{personal}} life he met with many tragedies, losing both his wives, two daughters, and his younger son whom he loved very dearly, {{at the age of}} three. He was a very hard worker in his earlier days. It became common practice for him to work all day at the office then go to <b>the</b> theatre <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening to act in a play, returning home at <b>three</b> or four <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning. But when his first wife Pramodini gave birth to a still born daughter, Girish regretted his negligence of his wife and engaged the best doctors for her. However she died leaving a son and a daughter. Girish was 30 years old at that time and this incident hardened his disbelief in God.|$|R

They drove off several Confederate pickets and advanced up the river. Some of the fleeing Confederates rode to the nearby village of Green Pond to sound the alarm. Meanwhile, a company of the 2nd South Carolina under Captain Carver landed two miles above Fields Point at Tar Bluff and deployed into position. The two ships steamed upriver to the Nichols Plantation, where the gunboat Harriet A. Weed anchored.|$|E

It burned houses of wood and stone, even the monastery of St. Dominic, the royal hospital for the Spaniards, and the royal warehouses, without leaving a building standing among them. Fourteen people died in the fire, Spaniards, Filipinos and Negroes, among them Licentiate Sanz, canon of the cathedral. In all 260 houses were burned, with much property that was in them. The damage was estimated at more than one million pesos.|$|E

25|$|The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Regiments {{participated in}} the Battle of Prairie Grove under their state designations. It is {{asserted}} that Col. Charles W. Adams treated his regiment of conscripts more like prisoners than soldiers, with the men being held under guard and herded around like cattle, for example. The regiment spent the morning of December 7 near Prairie Grove church facing south. At about <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon it was ordered into the fight. Upon reaching Battle Ridge, the regiment {{was placed in a}} gap between Fagan's Brigade and Shelby's Brigade behind the south fence of the Borden orchard. The regiment fired a volley from behind the fence toward {{the right wing of the}} Twenty-sixth Indiana. When the Hoosiers fell back the regiment climbed over the fence and advanced north through the orchard (which was filled with fearfully mangled Union and Confederate corpses from an earlier clash) directly toward the Borden house. At approximately the place where the modern tour road crosses the orchard the regiment ran into a storm of fire from the left wing of the Thirty-seventh Illinois, including the left flank company which was armed with Colt revolving rifles. That is when the regiment broke. As both Adams and Hindman noted in their reports, many of the company officers went with the men.|$|E

500|$|Akiva Goldsman {{decided to}} move the story from Los Angeles to New York City to take {{advantage}} of locations that would more easily show emptiness. Goldsman explained, [...] "L.A. looks empty at <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon, [...] New York is never empty [...] [...] [...] it was a much more interesting way of showing the windswept emptiness of the world." [...] Warner Bros. initially rejected this idea because of the logistics, but Francis Lawrence was determined to shoot on location, to give the film a natural feel that would benefit from not shooting on soundstages. Lawrence went to the city with a camcorder, and filmed areas filled with crowds. Then, a special effects test was conducted to remove all those people. The test had a powerful effect on studio executives. Michael Tadross convinced authorities to close busy areas such as the Grand Central Terminal viaduct, several blocks of Fifth Avenue, and Washington Square Park. The film was shot primarily in the anamorphic format, with flashback scenes shot in Super 35.|$|E
500|$|To {{celebrate}} {{the launch of}} the London Free School's magazine International Times in 1966, they performed in front of 2,000 people {{at the opening of the}} Roundhouse, attended by celebrities including Paul McCartney and Marianne Faithfull. In mid-1966, road manager Peter Wynne-Willson joined their road crew, and updated the band's lighting rig with some innovative ideas including the use of polarisers, mirrors and stretched condoms. After their record deal with EMI, Pink Floyd purchased a Ford Transit van, then considered extravagant band transportation. On 29 April 1967, they headlined an all-night event called The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream at the Alexandra Palace, London. Pink Floyd arrived at the festival at around <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning after a long journey by van and ferry from the Netherlands, taking the stage just as the sun was beginning to rise. In July 1969, precipitated by their space-related music and lyrics, they took part in the live BBC television coverage of the Apollo 11 moon landing, performing an instrumental piece which they called [...] "Moonhead".|$|E
500|$|An [...] "Anybody But McGovern" [...] coalition, led by {{southern}} Democrats {{and organized}} labor, {{formed in the}} weeks following the final primaries. McGovern's nomination did not become assured until {{the first night of}} the 1972 Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida, where, following intricate parliamentary maneuverings led by campaign staffer Rick Stearns, a Humphrey credentials challenge regarding the California winner-take-all rules was defeated. Divisive arguments over the party platform then followed; what resulted was arguably the most liberal one of any major U.S. party. On July 12, 1972, McGovern officially won the Democratic nomination. In doing so and in taking over the party's processes and platform, McGovern produced what The New York Times termed [...] "a stunning sweep". The convention distractions led to a hurried process to pick a vice presidential running mate. Turned down by his first choice, Ted Kennedy, as well as by several others, McGovern selected – with virtually no vetting – Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton. On the final night of the convention, procedural arguments over matters such as a new party charter, and a prolonged vice presidential nomination process that descended into farce, delayed the nominee's acceptance speech. As a result, McGovern delivered his speech, [...] "Come home America!", at <b>three</b> <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, reducing his television audience from about 70million people to about 15million.|$|E
