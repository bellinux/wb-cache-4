2500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Burr {{was rumored to}} be romantically {{involved}} with Natalie Wood. Wood's agent sent her on public dates so she could be noticed by directors and producers, and so the men she dated could present themselves in public as heterosexuals. The dates also helped to disguise Wood's relationship with Robert Wagner, whom she later married. Burr felt enough attraction to Wood to resent Warner Bros.' decision to promote her attachment <b>to</b> <b>Tab</b> Hunter rather than him. Robert Benevides later said, [...] "He was a little bitter about it. He was really in love with her, I guess." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Cardinals kept winning {{following}} {{the departure of}} franchise icons La Russa and Pujols. [...] Former Cardinals backstop Mike Matheny became the new Cardinals manager for the 2012 season and onwards. Carlos Beltrán, another free agent signed to replace Pujols before the 2012 season, garnered a Player of the Week award in May after hitting six home runs within a week; he eventually hit 32 for the season. [...] In the playoffs, the Cardinals capitalized on their newfound comeback persona against the Washington Nationals in the NLDS: in the final game, Pete Kozma drove two runs {{in the ninth inning}} to win the series after being down 6-0. [...] However, after mounting a 3–1 lead, they fell to the San Francisco Giants in the NLCS. [...] After the season, top publications such as ESPN and Baseball Prospectus continued <b>to</b> <b>tab</b> the Cardinals farm system {{as one of the top}} systems in baseball.|$|E
2500|$|A {{large part}} of the CMLL roster {{accompanied}} Negro Casas as he made his entrance in Arena México, showing that the tecnicos and rudos of CMLL were largely united against the [...] "outside force". The CMLL wrestlers left ringside before the match could start to allow Negro Casas and Charly Manson to focus on each other. The official referee for the match was El Tirantes, a referee that actually came to CMLL with Los Invasores and that played the part of a crooked referee that favored the rudos, especially Los Invasores. In the opening minutes Casas and Manson both engaged in mat wrestling, both trying to apply some sort of submission hold on each other. After about four minutes of wrestling Manson was able to apply a modified Boston Crab on Casas who was forced to give up the first fall. The pro-CMLL crowd was pleased when Negro Casas quickly evened the score, pinning Charly Manson after just over a minute of wrestling. The third fall was very evenly matches, with neither gaining and advantage early on. About 10 minutes into the fall Casas manages to lock in a submission hold and forces his opponent <b>to</b> <b>tab</b> out, but El Tirantes had his back turned and intentionally ignored it as part of the match storyline. Moments later as Casas runs aross the ring El Tirantes [...] "Accidentally" [...] points to something in the corner so that Negro Casas is clothes lined by the referee. The surprise move gives Manson enough of an opening to quickly roll Casas up and pin him for the third and final fall. After the match Charly Manson grabbed the scissors and made the first couple of cuts to Casas' hair, then proudly displayed it as a sort of trophy while Casas had his hair shaved off. During the celebrations the rest of Los Invasores came to the ring, including Estrellita who seemed to not be hurt too badly from the earlier fall.|$|E

50|$|Tabnabbing is a {{computer}} exploit and phishing attack, which persuades users to submit their login details and passwords to popular websites by impersonating those sites and convincing the user that the site is genuine. The attack's name was coined in early 2010 by Aza Raskin, a security researcher and design expert. The attack takes advantage of user trust and inattention to detail in regard <b>to</b> <b>tabs,</b> {{and the ability of}} modern web pages <b>to</b> rewrite <b>tabs</b> and their contents a long time after the page is loaded. Tabnabbing operates in reverse of most phishing attacks in that it doesn’t ask users to click on an obfuscated link but instead loads a fake page in one of the open tabs in your browser.|$|R
