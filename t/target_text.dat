40|$|Translation of metaphorical {{expressions}} is a {{major challenge}} in literary translation and has {{attracted the attention of}} translation researchers and linguists alike. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the translation of emotive metaphorical expressions of happiness from Persian to English in the Persian novel “Savushun ” written by Simin Daneshvar. To achieve this aim, emotive metaphorical expressions relating to happiness from the source <b>text</b> and two <b>target</b> <b>texts</b> were collected. Subsequently, the conceptual metaphors underlying the metaphorical expressions in the source <b>text</b> and the <b>target</b> <b>texts</b> were investigated based upon the metaphor identification procedures (MIP), proposed by the Pragglejaz group (2007) and general framework of the conceptual metaphor theory (CMT). This paper attempts to identify the strategies used in the translation so that the translational equivalences of these metaphorical expressions were identified in the <b>target</b> <b>texts.</b> The conceptual metaphors of the translation were identified and compared with the conceptual metaphors in the source text. Preliminary results of the study revealed the nature of both similarities and differences in the conceptual metaphors of the source <b>text</b> to the <b>target</b> <b>texts.</b> The similarities are mostly attributed to the universality metaphor, whereas the differences are related to two different concepts and different culture in the translation of metaphors...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>Target</b> <b>Text</b> (TT) is a {{translated}} text {{written in}} the intended Target Language, {{which is the result}} of a translation from a given Source Text. According to Jeremy Munday's definition of translation, [...] "the process of translation between two different written languages involves the changing of an original written text (the source text or ST) in the original verbal language (the source language or SL) into a written text (the <b>target</b> <b>text</b> or TT) in a different verbal language (the target language or TL)". The terms 'source text' and 'target text' are preferred over 'original' and 'translation' because they do not have the same positive vs. negative value judgment.|$|E
5000|$|In translation, a Source Text (ST) is a text {{written in}} a given Source Language which is to be, or has been, {{translated}} into another language.

According to Jeremy Munday's definition of translation, [...] "the process of translation between two different written languages involves the changing of an original written text (the source text or ST) in the original verbal language (the source language or SL) into a written text (the <b>target</b> <b>text</b> or TT) in a different verbal language (the target language or TL)".|$|E

50|$|Self-{{translation}} is {{a translation}} of a source text into a <b>target</b> <b>text</b> by the writer of the source text. Self-translation occurs in various writing situations. Since research on self-translation largely focuses on literary self-translation, this article will {{tend to have a}} similar focus.|$|E
50|$|When translating, one of {{the main}} {{purposes}} of the TM is to retrieve the most useful matches in the memory so that the translator can choose the best one. The TM must show both the source and <b>target</b> <b>text</b> pointing out the identities and differences.|$|E

30|$|The present {{research}} chooses {{the perspective of}} coherence from a systemic functional linguistic view as the entry point to compare a source Chinese text and its two English translations, so as to illuminate {{the differences in the}} realization of coherence in both the Chinese source text and the English <b>target</b> <b>texts</b> and how coherence is kept and achieved in translation. It is necessary to examine the feasibility of systemic functional linguistics applied in analysing the realization of coherence in both Chinese and English. One benefit of systemic functional linguistics is that it can provide an overall view of different languages, and can describe both Chinese and English texts from a multi-dimensional view. The description can therefore set the two language texts in the same framework, which provides a basis for a comparative study. To compare the ways that the source and <b>target</b> <b>texts</b> realize coherence, the study will elaborate how the two English <b>target</b> <b>texts</b> handle the transference of coherence and how they are different from the Chinese source text and from each other based on the different properties of systemic functional linguistics.|$|R
40|$|What is the translator's {{impact on}} the {{information}} structure (IS) of causal expressions? This study proposes a description method for the internal IS of causal expressions with connectors and their translations. We implement Lambrecht's view (1990) that IS relates to interlocutors' 'mental states' and look upon information structuring as a cognitive patterning of linguistic elements {{with varying degrees of}} manifestness. These degrees are hypothesized to be determined by a set of at least five different features, three of which have been investigated in a parallel corpus of Dutch, French and English causal expressions: the presence of a causal connector, clause status and clause position. Primary results indicate that about one fifth of explicit causal constructions in the Dutch source texts have been rendered without their explicit causal connector in the <b>target</b> <b>texts</b> both in French and in English. In addition, the internal clause manifestness in causal sequences turns out to show more differences between the Dutch source texts and the English <b>target</b> <b>texts</b> than between the Dutch source texts and the French <b>target</b> <b>texts,</b> which mirror the Dutch source texts more closely...|$|R

40|$|In LSP {{translating}} {{the production of}} naturally-sounding, idiomatic <b>target</b> <b>texts</b> is often taken to mean special attention {{in the use of}} terminology. However, research in distribution of the elements of the message in different languages shows that the representation of the information structure is language-specific and that there are language-specific focus-attributing positions within the syntactic structure of sentences. In this paper, features of information structure and focus-attributing positions will be studied in a corpus of English-Italian translations of popular physics articles and compared with a corpus of original Italian articles on the same topic to see if the Italian information structure is used in translation or whether <b>target</b> <b>texts</b> reproduce the original English information structure. Results show that translations use – at least to a certain extent – the original English information structure, therefore making <b>target</b> <b>texts</b> sound partly unnatural. A number of revision strategies are proposed to reinstate a more typical Italian information structure {{in order to ensure that}} the informational value of sentence elements is preserved and higher-quality LSP translations are produced...|$|R
