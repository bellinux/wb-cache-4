5|$|The {{bones and}} joints form a {{mechanical}} structure with features comparable to hinges, mortice and <b>tenon</b> and {{ball and socket}} joints, etc, to provide both support and suitable flexibility. He compares the spine to The Iron Bridge at Bishop Wearmouth.|$|E
5|$|The nave, {{which is}} aisleless, was {{formerly}} known as the Capel Hir (Long Chapel). The pews in the nave are by Seddon and are of pitch pine with pegged <b>tenon</b> joints. The stonework is almost all nineteenth century to the nave south wall, less so elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The stalls and pews in the crossing, by Seddon, {{are similar}} to the pews in the nave (being of pitch pine with pegged <b>tenon</b> joints) but are more ornate, with open-arcaded front kneelers and two reading desks with triple pointed arches to the fronts and {{scrolled}} tops to the uprights.|$|E

50|$|In Swabia, Württemberg, Alsace, and Switzerland, {{the use of}} the lap-joint {{is thought}} to be the {{earliest}} method of connecting the wall plates and tie beams and is particularly identified with Swabia. A later innovation (also pioneered in Swabia) was the use of <b>tenons</b> — builders left timbers to season which were held in place by wooden pegs (i.e., <b>tenons).</b> The timbers were initially placed with the <b>tenons</b> left an inch or two out of intended position and later driven home after becoming fully seasoned.|$|R
5|$|The {{construction}} of cathedrals and castles advanced building technology, {{leading to the}} development of large stone buildings. Ancillary structures included new town halls, houses, bridges, and tithe barns. Shipbuilding improved {{with the use of the}} rib and plank method rather than the old Roman system of mortise and <b>tenon.</b> Other improvements to ships included the use of lateen sails and the stern-post rudder, both of which increased the speed at which ships could be sailed.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} built with stone foundations, {{and the main}} {{structure}} is made of oak timbers, joined together using mortice and <b>tenon</b> joints, and held in place with oak pegs. Wattle and daub or lath and plaster are used to fill the spaces between the timbers. The black and white appearance from the timber framing construction dates from the Tudor period, though some parts have been repaired in later years.|$|E
5|$|Architecture {{during the}} Song period reached new heights of sophistication. Authors such as Yu Hao and Shen Kuo wrote books {{outlining}} {{the field of}} architectural layouts, craftsmanship, and structural engineering in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively. Shen Kuo preserved the written dialogues of Yu Hao when describing technical issues such as slanting struts built into pagoda towers for diagonal wind bracing. Shen Kuo also preserved Yu's specified dimensions and units of measurement for various building types. The architect Li Jie (1065–1110), who published the Yingzao Fashi ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') in 1103, greatly expanded upon the works of Yu Hao and compiled the standard building codes used by the central government agencies and by craftsmen throughout the empire. He addressed the standard methods of construction, design, and applications of moats and fortifications, stonework, greater woodwork, lesser woodwork, wood-carving, turning and drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, painting and decoration, brickwork, glazed tile making, and provided proportions for mortar formulas in masonry. In his book, Li provided detailed and vivid illustrations of architectural components and cross-sections of buildings. These illustrations displayed various applications of corbel brackets, cantilever arms, mortise and <b>tenon</b> work of tie beams and cross beams, and diagrams showing the various building types of halls in graded sizes. He also outlined the standard units of measurement and standard dimensional measurements of all building components described and illustrated in his book.|$|E
50|$|The chair {{does not}} fold. Although it is {{frequently}} assumed to do so, especially when made with circular <b>tenons,</b> triangular frames remain rigid {{even if they}} are joined by bearings. If the <b>tenons</b> are tusked then the chair may be quickly dismantled for shipping. Chairs for re-enactment are usually made in this way, but there is no evidence in period that they were regarded as being especially portable.|$|R

25|$|<b>Tenon</b> jig: A <b>tenon</b> jig is {{a device}} that holds the {{workpiece}} vertically so cuts can be made across the end. This allows tenons to be formed. Often this is a purchased item, {{but it can be}} shop made. The <b>tenon</b> jig is guided by a miter slot or a fence.|$|E
25|$|The corr had a brass strap {{nailed to}} each side, pierced by tapered brass tuning pins. The treble end had a <b>tenon</b> which fitted {{into the top}} of the com (soundbox). On a low-headed harp the corr was morticed at the bass end to receive a <b>tenon</b> on the làmh-chrann; on a high-headed harp this <b>tenon</b> fitted into a mortice {{on the back of the}} làmh-chrann.|$|E
25|$|In 1788 <b>Tenon</b> {{published}} the Mémoire sur les hôpitaux de Paris (Memoirs on the Hospitals of Paris), a treatise {{that was a}} concise and detailed account of French hospitals. It was concerned with aspects such as hygiene, patient care and environmental conditions of hospitals. Among the researches conducted was a visit by <b>Tenon</b> and Charles-Augustin de Coulomb to inspect the revolutionary design of the Royal Naval Hospital, Stonehouse. The publication was a catalyst in regards to efforts made for replacement of the Hôtel-Dieu of Paris, being decided by a committee from the Academy of Sciences, whose members were <b>Tenon,</b> along with famous scientists that included Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier (1743–1794), Coulomb (1736–1806) and Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827).|$|E

50|$|The {{shoulder}} plane (also bullnose plane) is a plane tool with a blade {{flush with the}} edges of the plane, allowing trimming right up {{to the edge of a}} workpiece. Like a rebate plane, the {{shoulder plane}}'s blade extends, therefore cuts, to the full width of the tool. The shoulder plane is used to trim the shoulders and faces of <b>tenons.</b> It is used when it is necessary to trim right into the concave corner where two surfaces of the same piece of wood meet perpendicularly. It is also commonly used to clean up dadoes (housings) and <b>tenons</b> for joinery.|$|R
50|$|Works include {{numerous}} handmade curved banisters and balustrades reproduced from17th-century spirals and motifs. These assemblages {{are always}} created using <b>tenons,</b> mortises or pegs, {{without the slightest}} trace of welding, according to the finest French tradition.|$|R
25|$|A {{signature}} model {{named for}} the guitarist (Crimson Guitars Robert Fripp Signature) features Fernandes Sustainer and MIDI elements, with a Les Paul Model Body. Another difference from the Gibson Les Paul is that Fripp's guitar is built using a deep set neck <b>tenon</b> rather than a traditional set neck.|$|E
25|$|Near the {{courtyard}} is the Semi-Subterranean Temple; a square sunken courtyard that is unique for its north–south rather than east–west axis. The walls {{are covered with}} <b>tenon</b> heads of many different styles, suggesting that the structure was reused for different purposes over time. It was built with walls of sandstone pillars and smaller blocks of Ashlar masonry. The largest stone block in the Kalasasaya is estimated to weigh 26.95 metric tons.|$|E
25|$|Biscuits are {{predominantly}} used in joining sheet goods such as plywood, particle board and medium-density fibreboard. They are sometimes used with solid wood, replacing mortise and <b>tenon</b> joints {{as they are}} easier to make and almost as strong. They are also used to align pieces of wood when joined edge-to-edge in making wider panels. It is important {{to use the same}} face when cutting the slots, so the boards are perfectly flush.|$|E
40|$|The shell bearing of No. 3 journal {{had failed}} by flaking. The flaking {{took place at}} the {{steel-aluminium}} alloy interface. From the evidences, it appears most probable that due to axial load on the crankshaft, the bearings have moved in the forward direction. This had resulted in wearing out of the <b>tenons</b> on the shell bearings. The <b>tenons</b> on the shell bearing of No. 3 journal were completely worn out and hence the bearing was free to rotate along with the crankshaft. During this rotation, the bearing had experienced excessive load leading to flaking off of the bearing material by fatigue. No metallurgical abnormalities were found responsible for the failure...|$|R
50|$|Structure 39 {{has been}} {{restored}} and lies within the South Acropolis. It has three stepped doorways that open onto a single, irregularly shaped room. The remains of a perforated roof comb survive, with <b>tenons</b> that once supported stucco decoration.|$|R

25|$|The biscuit {{reinforced}} {{butt joint}} {{is a fairly}} recent innovation in butt joint construction. It is used primarily in carcase and frame construction. The biscuit is an oval shaped piece of specially dried and compressed wood, usually beech, which is installed in matching mortises in both members of the joint {{in a similar fashion}} to a loose or floating <b>tenon.</b> Biscuit joints are common in both frame and carcase construction. They are particularly convenient for panel glue ups as they facilitate alignment of panel members.|$|E
25|$|Commonly used {{woodworking}} tools included axes, adzes, chisels, pull saws, and bow drills. Mortise and <b>tenon</b> joints are attested {{from the}} earliest Predynastic period. These joints were strengthened using pegs, dowels and leather or cord lashings. Animal glue came to be used only in the New Kingdom period. Ancient Egyptians invented the art of veneering and used varnishes for finishing, though the composition of these varnishes is unknown. Although different native acacias were used, as was the wood from the local sycamore and tamarisk trees, deforestation in the Nile valley resulted in {{the need for the}} importation of wood, notably cedar, but also Aleppo pine, boxwood and oak, starting from the Second Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Shipwreck D {{provided}} {{the team with}} an unprecedented opportunity to document hull construction {{during a time of}} transition. When observing the sonar signature of Shipwreck D, a long, slender upright feature on the seabed, transformed itself into a wooden mast. Elements rarely present on shallower shipwreck sites are beautifully preserved 200 m below the surface. Disappointingly for ship scholars and historians of technology, there are few indications of how the planks of Sinop D are held together. There are no mortise and <b>tenon</b> fastenings, and no sewing. Shipwreck D {{may be one of the}} earliest lateen-rigged ships to be studied by archaeologists. The angle of the mast and the lack of fittings on it suggest that a lateen sail is the most likely configuration for such a small vessel.|$|E
25|$|Routers {{have many}} uses. With {{the help of}} the {{multitude}} of jigs and various bits, they are capable of producing dovetails, mortises, and <b>tenons,</b> moldings of infinite varieties, dados, rabbets/rebates, raised panel doors and frames, cutting circles, and so much more.|$|R
