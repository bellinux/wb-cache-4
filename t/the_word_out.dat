500|$|The special {{departed}} from Santa Fe's [...] La Grande Station in Los Angeles at 1:00pm Pacific Time on July 9, 1905. [...] The locomotive and three cars left {{the station and}} the cheering crowds, estimated at 20,000people, and began its run eastward. [...] The number of people at La Grande Station is remarkable in itself since the train's schedule was planned only one day before the event; the Santa Fe used the train {{as an opportunity to}} publicize itself and got <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> to news agencies across the railroad's territory.|$|E
500|$|The Workshop devoted 8% {{of their}} initial budget to {{advertise}} the new show. [...] In what Morrow called [...] "an extensive campaign" [...] that Lesser stated [...] "would demand {{at least as}} much ingenuity as production and research", they promoted the show with educators and the broadcast industry. [...] The Workshop understood that a special effort had to be made to reach their target community because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups. To get <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> to their target audience in the inner cities, they hired Evelyn Davis from the Urban League, whom Michael Davis called [...] "remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable", as the Workshop's first Vice President of Community Relations and head of the Workshop's Community Educational Services (CES) division.|$|E

500|$|The {{self-immolation}} necessitated {{a change}} in tactics for Falun Gong. Tiananmen Square had been [...] "permanently contaminated" [...] as a venue for protest, according to journalist Ethan Gutmann, and Falun Gong's daily demonstrations in Beijing nearly ceased altogether. According to Human Rights Watch, practitioners may have concluded [...] "the protests had outlived their usefulness for demonstrating Chinese abuses or for informing an overseas audience of Falungong's harmlessness." [...] Diaspora practitioners living overseas focused their attentions on getting <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> about the treatment of practitioners by the Chinese government, issuing reports to the United Nations and human rights organisations, staging public marches and hunger strikes outside of China, and documenting human rights abuses on websites. Within China, practitioners used mass mailings and handed out literature to [...] "spread the truth" [...] and counter the government's allegations against them. In an August 2001 press release, the US-based Falun Dafa Information Center noted this shift in strategy, and said that Chinese practitioners [...] "sometimes also manage to post large posters and banners in major thoroughfares. They even set up loudspeakers on rooftops or trees around labour camps and in densely populated areas to broadcast news about the human rights abuses." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, Chris was {{the focus}} of a coward punch storyline. During Kyle and Georgia's joint bucks and hen night, Chris was forced to eject a drunk Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) from The Waterhole when he caused a scene. Shortly after, Josh {{returned}} and hit Chris with a coward punch, causing him to fall and hit his head on a rock. Kyle and Georgia found Chris unconscious and he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Mason was pleased to be given the storyline, explaining that it was a topical issue in Australia at the time. He said [...] "The whole moral of the story is that one little mistake can have really dire consequences. I like to think that we can use this story to really educate people and get <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> there that this is something really serious that we're battling against at the moment." [...] Mason thought that Chris might be able to forgive Josh in the future, but it would be [...] "a long process", and he would {{have to deal with the}} fact that his life had changed forever due to the attack first. Mason added that Chris would have difficulties accepting that someone like Josh attacked him.|$|E

Later, he reported back {{that he had been}} [...] "toying with the idea", and was [...] "willing to go forward with a publishing line that was not a brand extension for his own work but a platform for Riordan to bring other great writers to the attention of his vast and loyal audience." [...] She also said that the imprint is planned to launch with two as-yet undetermined books. [...] "The point of making this announcement now is to get <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> about what we’re looking for.” ...|$|E

2500|$|A new group, the Committee for Civic Progress, {{was formed}} to help promote the bond levy. Its members {{included}} 150 business, labor, real estate leaders. The group asked the City Council to send personal letters to their constituents, asking them to support the proposal. [...] All but three council members agreed to do so. The Greater Cleveland Convention and Visitors Bureau also helped. It issued a study in which it claimed that the convention center would generate $24 {{million a year in}} new economic activity, and printed 300,000 leaflets to get <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> about the study's conclusions. Local radio and television stations donated time to the Committee for Civic Progress so it could run advertisements supporting the proposal.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1983 Albini met Naked Raygun singer Jeff Pezzati through mutual {{friends and}} {{convinced}} him to play bass guitar with Big Black. Pezzati recalled that Albini [...] "knew {{a heck of a}} lot about, right from the start, how to release a record and get <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> that you have a record", and that [...] "He jumped at the chance to have a band play his stuff." [...] The two practiced in Pezzati's basement, and one day Naked Raygun guitarist Santiago Durango came downstairs and asked to play along. The trio clicked as a unit, Durango's ability to rework arrangements and tweak sounds helping to refine Albini's song ideas. According to Albini, [...] "He ended up being absolutely crucial to Big Black." ...|$|E
2500|$|On Friday morning, September 13, 2013, Patrick Foye, the {{executive}} director of the Port Authority and an appointee of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, ordered that the lanes be reopened in a strongly worded 7:44 AM e-mail to senior PA officials and staff, including Bill Baroni and David Samson. In the e-mail, Foye called the decision to close the lanes [...] "hasty and ill-advised", said that the decision violated policy and long-standing custom at the PA, and that he believed that closing the lanes [...] "violates Federal Law and the laws of both States." [...] Foye asked his spokesman to get <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out.</b> Upon learning this, Baroni attempted to prevent any disclosure in order to keep the public in the dark. Additionally, Baroni forwarded the e-mail to Regina Egea, Christie's Director of the authorities unit overseeing the PA, three hours after it was sent by Foye.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1928, Bert Logan, an {{employee}} of the Hudson's Bay Company was posted to Little Red River, Alberta, on arrival he was unpacking when he suddenly became very ill. His wife, a nurse, realized he had diphtheria, and a desperate effort started to get inoculations to the town before anyone else was seriously infected. Simply getting <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> that help was needed was an adventure in its own. At the time, there were no roads in the north, and the nearest telegraph station was miles away over a frozen landscape. The message eventually reached Edmonton, and on January 1, May was asked if he could deliver the medicine. He left in an Avro Avian with another flying club member, Vic Horner, the next day around noon, and landed on Kimiwan Lake, McLennan for the night just before 4 p.m. when it was becoming dark. They refueled on the Peace River and continued their flight, arriving in Fort Vermilion at 3 p.m. A group had just arrived from Little Red River and the drugs were quickly distributed. They had to stop in Peace River on the return flight due to engine damage from the low quality fuel, and did not arrive back in Edmonton until January 7. By this point, his flight had become known across Canada as [...] "the race against death", and he and Horner arrived to find a media circus and a mob of thousands of Edmontonians waiting for them at the airport.|$|E
