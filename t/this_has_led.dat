5|$|The {{area was}} notorious for its deep poverty, {{overcrowding}} and associated social problems. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> to the East End’s history of intense political activism and association {{with some of}} the country’s most influential social reformers.|$|E
5|$|The term aiki {{does not}} readily {{appear in the}} Japanese {{language}} {{outside the scope of}} budō. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> to many possible interpretations of the word.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} 27 Milky Way neighbors {{found that in}} all dwarf galaxies, the central mass is {{approximately}} 10 million solar masses, {{regardless of whether the}} galaxy has thousands or millions of stars. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> to the suggestion that galaxies are largely formed by dark matter, and that the minimum size may indicate a form of warm dark matter incapable of gravitational coalescence on a smaller scale.|$|E
50|$|Much of Carlin's {{career has}} dealt with the {{politics}} of South Africa. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to {{a relationship with the}} former South African president, Nelson Mandela.|$|R
50|$|The earth of Verzy is poor for agriculture. Could <b>this</b> <b>have</b> <b>led</b> to a {{lineage of}} a {{distinct}} phenotype? No, because many beeches {{there are not}} dwarf beeches.|$|R
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to the {{formulation}} of Moore's second law, also called Rock's law, {{which is that the}} capital cost of a semiconductor fab also increases exponentially over time.|$|R
5|$|A variant {{from the}} Gibson area has an upright habit and leaves. Otherwise, Banksia speciosa shows little {{variation}} across its range. Combined with its vigour and prominence in its habitat, <b>this</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> George {{to speculate that}} it is a recent development among its relatives.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates are {{classified}} {{according to their}} glycemic index, a system for measuring how quickly a food that is eaten raises blood sugar levels, and glycemic load, which takes into account both the glycemic index {{and the amount of}} carbohydrate in the food. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> to carbohydrate counting, a method used by diabetics for planning their meals.|$|E
5|$|During some Christmases of {{the first}} decade of the 21st century, the Baby Jesus statue was often stolen from the outdoor nativity scene in Jönköping in Sweden, once thrown into the nearby lake of Vättern. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> to the nativity scene, {{resembling}} a wooden stable, being closed by nights.|$|E
50|$|The Ministry of Health is {{mandated}} {{to provide a}} functioning healthcare system to benefit all citizens. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to the reforming of the entire healthcare system in the country.|$|R
50|$|It is now {{understood}} that {{the tail of the}} sperm, which contains additional mtDNA, may also enter the egg. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to increased controversy about the fate of paternal mtDNA.|$|R
50|$|Allegations of {{political}} corruption arose when pictures were found of Galician premier Alberto Núñez Feijóo vacationing with convicted smuggler Marcial Dorado. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to local belief that certain Galician crime clans have infiltrated local politics.|$|R
5|$|In 1800 {{there were}} three red deer on the island, later {{replaced}} by goats and then by a small herd of black cattle. Subsequently the summer grazing was used for sheep by crofters from Iona, but in 1997 all livestock was removed. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> to a regeneration of the island's vegetation.|$|E
5|$|In the United States and the European Union, {{since the}} early 1990s {{regulations}} {{have been in place}} that are designed to prevent shellfish from contaminated waters entering the food chain. This has meant that there is sometimes a shortage of regulated shellfish, with consequent higher prices. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> to illegal harvesting and sale of shellfish on the black market, which can be a health hazard.|$|E
5|$|Ned is a {{genuinely}} well-meaning good-natured person {{and is one}} of the few in Springfield to whom that description applies. Firmly religious, he can be timid and something of a pushover. He is a Republican and a devout Evangelical Christian who strictly follows the Bible literally and is easily shocked when challenged on any point of dogma. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> to his frequent calls to Reverend Lovejoy, who has become increasingly frustrated with and uninterested in Flanders.|$|E
50|$|On March 25, 2014 activists of Young Front visited an {{demonstration}} with {{a transparent}} featuring controversial personalities Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz, Stepan Bandera, Michał Vituška, Roman Shukhevych and Vincent Hadleŭski. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to {{excitement of the}} Russian ambassador.|$|R
5000|$|In AdventureQuest Worlds, the 4th Lord of Chaos {{is named}} Kitsune. Kitsune is shown as an {{anthropomorphic}} fox whose desire {{to not have}} outsiders on Yokai Island. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> Drakath into Chaorrupting him into an armored Yokai Shogun.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 {{he accused}} {{the city of}} {{ignoring}} the aging infrastructure of the city's sewer system and that <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to several raw sewage overflows due to intense rain events for which the city was sued by an environmental group.|$|R
5|$|Partly {{because of}} {{theoretical}} and mathematical difficulties {{and partly because}} of the extremely high energies (beyond what is technologically possible for the foreseeable future) needed to test these theories experimentally, there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point to any of these models being a correct fundamental description of nature. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> some in the community to criticize these approaches to unification and question the value of continued research on these problems.|$|E
5|$|People {{sometimes}} suspected vampirism when a cadaver did {{not look}} as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition, {{and many of the}} signs are little known. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed at all or, ironically, to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.|$|E
5|$|Specialised subsets of English arise spontaneously in {{international}} communities, for example, among international business people, as an auxiliary language. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> some scholars {{to develop the}} study of English as an auxiliary languages. Globish uses a relatively small subset of English vocabulary (about 1500 words with highest use {{in international}} business English) {{in combination with the}} standard English grammar. Other examples include Simple English.|$|E
50|$|This genus {{was named}} Mangelia by Leach and {{accepted}} by Risso in 1826. Later, some authors, such as Lovén in 1846, spelled it inadvertently as Mangilia, {{to honor the}} Italian malacologist Mangili Guiseppe (1767-1829). <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to some confusion.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to armed {{clashes between}} factions, both factions state {{that they are}} being betrayed by their former colleagues, or that some member of the {{opposite}} faction has ties with the cartels, this in an attempt to legitimize their actions.|$|R
25|$|<b>This</b> scandal <b>has</b> <b>led</b> to {{a number}} of court cases worldwide.|$|R
5|$|The Hammond organ {{has also}} been {{emulated}} in software. The most prominent emulator in this field has been the Native Instruments B4 series, which has been praised for its attention to detail and choice of features. Emagic (now part of Apple) has also produced a software emulation, the EVB3. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> to a Hammond organ module with all controls and features of the original instrument in the Logic Pro audio production suite.|$|E
5|$|The {{common eland}} is {{sometimes}} farmed and hunted for its meat, {{and in some}} cases can be better used than cattle because it is more suited to African climates. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> to some Southern African farmers switching from cattle to eland. Common elands are also pictured as supporters in the coat of arms of Grootfontein, Namibia.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} a long history of use in {{traditional}} medicine in its native range, where it is employed as a treatment for a variety of ailments. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> to the investigation of its phytochemistry. Its flowers can be eaten in salads or crushed for dyemaking, and the plant has been considered for potential use in the phytoremediation of contaminated soil.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to the {{development}} of underwater treadmills to relieve stress on the animals joints whilst building strength. These have been {{a turning point in the}} rehabilitation of dogs as they can be placed in smaller areas, but offer a controlled treatment.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, NRT sales {{fell for}} the first time since 2008 while sales for e-cigarettes {{continued}} to increase at a substantial rate. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to speculation that UK smokers are trying to quit with e-cigarettes rather than traditional, pharma-backed NRT methods.|$|R
5000|$|Advocating Britart, {{she is on}} the {{opposite}} side of the fence from the traditionally oriented critic, Brian Sewell. <b>This</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to personal comments in the media. In 1995, when asked about a suitable Christmas present for him (he keeps dogs), she replied: ...|$|R
5|$|The {{work has}} {{developed}} a reputation as an essential one for aspiring violin virtuosi to conquer. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> to its becoming virtually ubiquitous in the discography of concert violinists, even including those who were only active at the very dawn of recorded sound and of whom very little recorded music exists, such as Eugène Ysaÿe. Even so, it remains technically challenging and is {{generally considered to be}} as difficult as many other famous counterparts.|$|E
5|$|A {{cause and}} effect {{methodology}} led to a relatively value-free approach to economic science, in which Cantillon was uninterested in the merit of any particular economic action or phenomenon, focusing rather on the explanation of relationships. This led Cantillon to separate economic science from politics and ethics {{to a greater degree}} than previous mercantilist writers. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> to disputes on whether Cantillon can justly be considered a mercantilist or one of the first anti-mercantilists, given that Cantillon often cited government-manipulated trade surpluses and specie accumulation as positive economic stimuli. Others argue that in instances where Cantillon is thought to have supported certain mercantilist policies, he actually provided a more neutral analysis by explicitly stating possible limitations of mercantilist policies.|$|E
5|$|Adjeng (Titi Rajo Bintang) {{lives alone}} in an {{apartment}} paid for by her boyfriend, a rich businessman (Joko Anwar). A writer of children's stories, she wishes to write short stories for adults; in this, she is mentored by Asmoro (Ray Sahetapy)– with whom she is also having sex. Meanwhile, Adjeng's mother (Henidar Amroe) handles various aspects of her life, constantly calling her and making surprise visits. <b>This</b> <b>has</b> <b>led</b> Adjeng's friends, Venny (Ayu Dewi) and Andien (Fairuz Faisal), to tease her about her overbearing mother.|$|E

50|$|All of Paisley's {{sewage and}} {{industrial}} effluent had been discharged untreated into the River Cart via its tributaries: the St Mirin Burn, the Lady Burn, the Sneddon Burn, the Espedair Burn, etc. By 1870 <b>this</b> <b>had</b> <b>led</b> to many complaints about smells and epidemics.|$|R
