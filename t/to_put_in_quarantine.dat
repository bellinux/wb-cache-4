5000|$|On a {{beach in}} Australia, two American surfers say goodbye {{to each other as}} one is about to leave for his flight back to California. The two men don't notice the large number of dead birds on the beach. On the flight, the surfer {{returning}} home starts coughing up blood and dies before the plane can land. Back in Australia, the other surfer is found dead in his apartment. Kayla Martin (Tiffani Thiessen) is a medical doctor with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) who has been assigned to the case. She and the local officials carry the body of the surfer out of the plane and start processing people <b>to</b> be <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>quarantine</b> until they can be evaluated for exposure. During the transfer, one of the passengers escapes to complete a business deal and unknowingly spreads the virus throughout Los Angeles. It is also revealed that outbreaks of the so-called [...] "riptide virus" [...] (as it comes to be known), an offshoot of the bird flu, are occurring in other cities around the world.|$|R
40|$|AbstractOn 12 May 2008, an {{earthquake}} measuring 8. 0 on the Richter scale struck Wenchuan County, Sichuan, China. Between 12 May and 11 June, 1823 victims were hospitalized in West China Hospital. These patients were severely injured, {{and most of}} their wounds were contaminated. Here, the results of bacteriological identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of 725 non-duplicate isolates from earthquake victims are presented. Gram-negative bacilli were most frequently isolated (71. 3 %). Only 18. 9 % of isolates were Gram-positive bacteria; Candida spp. accounted for 9. 7 %, and Gram-negative cocci for 0. 1 %. After anaerobic culture, four Clostridium sordellii strains and one Clostridium bifermentans strain were isolated from deep wounds. Specimen culture from earthquake victims revealed a spectrum of pathogens and antibiotic susceptibilities that was different from that usually encountered in West China Hospital, especially concerning methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum β-lactamase producers, and multidrug-resistant (MDR) non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli. The pathophysiology of the injuries in earthquake victims was different from that in the patients who were not earthquake victims. A combination of environmental bacteria with {{a high proportion of}} Gram-negative bacteria was often observed in the earthquake victims. Approximately 26 % of all earthquake victims were shown to be carriers of MDR microorganisms. Therefore, appropriate microbiological assessment upon admission, and identification of patients <b>to</b> be <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>quarantine,</b> is of paramount importance...|$|R
50|$|Camp Logan also {{developed}} further notorious attention among {{the residents of}} Houston the following year as {{the focal point of}} the first widespread local outbreak of the deadly 1918 Spanish Flu. By September 24 of that year over 600 cases had been reported by the US Army surgeons at the camp, who made the fateful decision to send the sick to homes and hospitals in the community to try to protect those soldiers still healthy at the camp. By October 3 doctors reported 48 soldiers from the camp had died from the flu and it had begun to rapidly spread through the city. By October 9 the local newspapers reported that 33 flu related deaths had now occurred in the city and that the Mayor, District Clerk, and 20 police officers had contracted. Flu cases in the city were now reported to be in the thousands and steps were being taken <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>quarantines</b> <b>in</b> place. Public schools, restaurants, and gatherings were shut down including the Barnum & Bailey Circus and local churches.|$|R
50|$|Doctors {{say that}} only after Speaker left the United States did they realize he likely had XDR-TB. Speaker {{says that he}} was {{informed}} of MDR TB before leaving the country, and that while officials preferred him not to fly, they {{said that he was}} not a threat and was not required to wear a mask. Once Speaker was in Europe, however, test results showed his strain of tuberculosis was even rarer than originally thought, leading public health officials to try to persuade Speaker to turn himself in to Italian health authorities. The CDC informed him that there were no options for the CDC to get him home, and {{that he would have to}} arrange private transportation. Speaker instead flew by commercial jet to Prague and then on to Montréal. Both Speaker and his new wife claimed that, had they been offered transport, they would have accepted it and would have waited in Rome. Speaker has also said that the CDC told him they were going to send officials <b>to</b> <b>put</b> him <b>in</b> Italian <b>quarantine</b> for up to two years, and that he was not told special transportation was arranged.|$|R

50|$|Ordinary plates {{have black}} text {{on a white}} background. They consist of three letters first, a space and three digits after. This space was {{formerly}} used for a taxation sticker. Above it {{the vehicle identification number}} is printed and above the last digit the date of plate manufacture is printed. All vehicles must legally carry both a front and a rear plate except for motorcycles, trailers (rear only), tractors and other off-road machinery (front only). The registration number is tied to the vehicles VIN and remains unchanged, even after change of ownership, until the vehicle is scrapped or exported. So it is possible to decommission a registered vehicle for any length of time. A decommissioned registered vehicle does not require road tax or a valid insurance. The registration plate remains on the vehicle while decommissioned. Registration numbers of scrapped, exported and de-registered vehicles are <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>quarantine</b> before they are re-used with new registered vehicles.|$|R

60|$|The ship {{proceeded}} up to Carthagena, {{and went}} in. Here we were <b>put</b> <b>in</b> <b>quarantine</b> for several days. The port {{was full of}} heavy ships of war, several of which were three-deckers; and an arrival direct from London made quite a sensation among them. We had divers visits from the officers, though I {{do not know what}} it all amounted to. From Carthagena we were sent down the coast to a little place called Aguilas, where we began to take in a cargo of barilla. At night we would discharge our shingle ballast into the water, contrary to law; and, in the day, we took in cargo. So clear was the water, that our night's work might easily be seen next morning, lying beneath the ship. As we lay in a roadstead, it mattered little, few vessels touching at the port. While at this place, there was an alarm of an attack from an English man-of-war that was seen in the offing, and priests enough turned out to defend an ordinary town.|$|R
