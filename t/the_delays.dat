40|$|The back {{bias voltage}} on a {{functional}} circuit is controlled through a closed loop process. A delay element receives a clock pulse and produces a <b>delay</b> output. <b>The</b> <b>delay</b> element is advantageously constructed {{of the same}} materials as the functional circuit so that the aging and degradation of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element parallels <b>the</b> degradation of the functional circuit. As <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element degrades, <b>the</b> transistor switching time increases, increasing <b>the</b> time <b>delay</b> of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> output. An AND gate compares a clock pulse to an output pulse of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element, <b>the</b> AND output forming a control pulse. A duty cycle of the control pulse is determined by <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> time between <b>the</b> clock pulse and <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element output. <b>The</b> control pulse is received at the input of a charge pump. The charge pump produces a back bias voltage which is then applied to <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element and to the functional circuit. If <b>the</b> time <b>delay</b> produced by <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element exceeds <b>the</b> optimal <b>delay,</b> <b>the</b> duty cycle of the control pulse is shortened, and the back bias voltage is lowered, thereby increasing the switching speed of the transistors in <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element and reducing <b>the</b> time <b>delay.</b> If <b>the</b> throughput of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element is too fast, the duty cycle of the control pulse is lengthened, raising the back bias voltage produced by the charge pump. This, in turn, lowers the switching speed of the transistors in both <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element and <b>the</b> functional circuit. The slower switching speed in <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element increases time delay. In this manner, the switching speed of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element, and of the functional circuit, is maintained at a constant level {{over the life of}} the circuit...|$|R

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>delay</b> step in DLLs can {{be defined}} as the finest change in <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> time of <b>the</b> output signal after a DLL’s output has been locked. <b>The</b> <b>delay</b> step is {{controlled}} by the CP voltage. To explain this, the analog control voltage signal from the CP is applied to <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> elements to control/tune <b>the</b> <b>delay.</b> This signal, applied to the gates of the delay-controlling transistors, precisely changes the current responsible for charging/discharging the output capacitance of <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> element. Consequently, and according to the current ratio relationship in Eq. (3) for fine <b>delay</b> control, <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> is varied precisely and a sub-gate delay resolution can be achieved.|$|R

5|$|Construction {{proceeded}} slowly, to {{the extent}} that there were letters in the local newspaper complaining about <b>the</b> <b>delays.</b> The first train ran into Epworth on 25 November 1901, to test the new bridge, and the event was attended by a crowd of over 400. The line involved more earthworks than the Goole and Marshland Light Railway, with major cuttings at Haxey and Epworth, where steam excavators were used, and a swing bridge over the canal at Crowle. The first fatality was a 15-year-old boy who was hit by a rock during blasting, and died at Doncaster Hospital in early 1902.|$|E
5|$|Despite precautions, the {{post-production}} faced significant delays {{owing to}} the digital inter-mediation, increased work-load due to the 3-D and dubbed versions of the film, and delays in {{the completion of the}} visual effects. The post-production also faced budget constraints and witnessed an overuse of CGI according to the cinematographer. <b>The</b> <b>delays</b> left only two days for printing the film and sending it to theatres, generating significant anxiety over a possible delay in the release. Khan subsequently kept strict tabs on the progress of work, and postponed his knee surgery to complete the film on time.|$|E

Due to <b>the</b> <b>delays</b> of Banjo-Kazooie, Rare felt that they needed a stronger intellectual property to attract a wider audience for a game scheduled to release before Christmas 1997, thus making the decision to revolve a game around the character of Diddy Kong.|$|E

5|$|Erie was an {{important}} shipbuilding, fishing, and railroad hub during the mid-19th century. The city was the site where three sets of track gauges met.

When a national standardized gauge was proposed, those jobs, {{and the importance of}} the rail hub itself, were put in jeopardy. In an event known as the Erie Gauge War, the citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, set fire to bridges, ripped up track and rioted to try to stop the standardization.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, {{construction}} resumed on roadways throughout Ontario. The expressway between Highland Creek and Oshawa {{was completed}} in December 1947, while other sections languished.

Despite <b>the</b> <b>delays,</b> highway minister George Doucett officially announced the plans for construction of the new trans-provincial expressway that year, with the Toronto to Oshawa expressway serving {{as a model for the}} design.

5|$|In 1884, a {{deputation}} led by Lord Shaftesbury {{was made}} to the Great Eastern Railway and Great Northern Railway, proposing that for trains due to arrive in central London prior to 8am, third class tickets should be sold at a fare of 3d providing the return journey was not made before 4pm. By May 1885 both railways had adopted this policy. However, <b>the</b> <b>delays</b> and uncertainty caused by the fares dispute had discouraged prospective tenants, leaving large numbers of properties vacant and causing further building work to slow considerably.

30|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the performance of}} a wireless video communication system operating over a fading channel, under both an end-to-end delay constraint and a bandwidth constraint.

So, the larger the duty cycle of the nodes, <b>the</b> smaller <b>the</b> <b>delay.</b> Therefore, this paper can reduce <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> by increasing <b>the</b> duty cycle of the node that is away from the sink. The following in Theorem 6 give the formula for <b>the</b> <b>delay</b> calculation under <b>the</b> optimization strategy of this paper.|$|R
