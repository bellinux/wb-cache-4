5|$|Megan {{receives}} backlash from Kate for {{not following}} procedure, but clay found in both Lizzy and Joe's pockets match. Samantha realizes <b>that</b> <b>Joe</b> found {{the crime scene}} of Lizzy's murder; the tennis courts at her school. Kate and Megan study her body and find a hand impression on her back, which matches {{one of her friends}} Heather Clayton (Meg Chambers Steedle). Heather killed Lizzy after she broke her finger during a lacrosse game. Lizzy's body was found elsewhere, meaning Heather had help moving the body, so Megan finds out that Lou helped Heather. Lou also admits killing Joe, as he was getting too close to the truth. After they arrest them, Megan revisits her mother Joan, asking to exhume her father’s body. Joan declines the request, telling Megan to leave him be. Megan and Samantha revisit Helen and Becky, revealing <b>that</b> <b>Joe</b> had an undiagnosed brain disorder, causing the emotional distance from the two, telling them <b>that</b> <b>Joe</b> helped solve the Lizzy Adler case.|$|E

5|$|Samoa Joe and Booker T {{started a}} rivalry over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship {{following}} Slammiversary. On the June12 episode of Impact!, Booker T claimed <b>that</b> <b>Joe</b> did not beat {{him at the}} event due to interference from Kevin Nash. This led to Nash stating <b>that</b> <b>Joe</b> could not beat Booker T in a one-on-one match later in the broadcast. After this segment, Joe announced that Booker T and he would face at Victory Road on July13 for the title. On the July10 episode of Impact!, Sting proclaimed {{that he did not}} know which of the two would win at Victory Road, but that he would be there to watch. At the event, Joe beat Booker T till he was bloody, causing several referees and security personnel to try to stop him to no avail.

5|$|The {{main event}} at Victory Road {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Samoa Joe and the {{challenger}} Booker T. Joe and Booker T previously fought at TNA's Slammiversary PPV event on June8 in a King of the Mountain match for the title, which Joe won to remain champion. On the June12 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Booker T claimed <b>that</b> <b>Joe</b> did not beat him at the event due to interference from Joe's mentor Kevin Nash. This led to Nash stating <b>that</b> <b>Joe</b> could not beat Booker T in a one-on-one match. After this segment, Joe announced that Booker T and he would face at Victory Road for the title. Since Houston is Booker T's hometown, TNA promoted the match as him attempting to win the championship {{for the people of}} Houston. On the July 10 episode of Impact!, Sting proclaimed {{that he did not know}} which of the two would win at Victory Road, but that he would be there to watch.|$|E
5|$|What you're {{basically}} saying is <b>that</b> <b>Joe</b> Berrios {{should get out}} of politics. If my brothers or whoever wants to come and work in government, they shouldn't be allowed to work in government. If you want to pass a law that says one individual is in government, then none of their friends or relatives can work in government, then you should pass that law.|$|E

5|$|Considering the {{lopsided}} {{score of}} the series, historians such as Paul Kitchen question why Dawson City was even granted a chance at the Cup. Dawson City had won no championships and {{did not belong to}} any recognized senior league. While team official Weldy Young knew Stanley Cup trustee P. D. Ross personally through their joint connection with the club, {{it may have been the}} political connections <b>that</b> <b>Joe</b> Boyle had with the government Interior Minister of the time, Clifford Sifton, that got Dawson City the series.|$|E

5|$|Sam Loover, {{a family}} friend and an agent of World Intelligence Network (WIN), persuades Mac to {{dedicate}} the services of Joe and the BIG RAT to the organisation: Joe will become a WIN operative with a difference, the unlimited possibilities offered by the BIG RAT serving as an invaluable tool for completing missions. After requisite knowledge and experience has been transferred, and provided <b>that</b> <b>Joe</b> is wearing customised glasses containing hidden electrodes (a portable storage device for brain impulses), {{he is able to}} carry out missions requiring proficiency in – among other disciplines – flying fighter aircraft, spaceflight, performing advanced neurosurgery and piano.|$|E

5000|$|In 1987, RJR resurrected the mascot {{for their}} Camel brand of cigarette, Joe Camel. Joe Camel, an {{anthropomorphic}} cartoon camel wearing sunglasses, was {{claimed to be}} a ploy to entice and interest the underaged in smoking. R.J. Reynolds maintained <b>that</b> <b>Joe's</b> [...] "smooth character" [...] was meant only to appeal to adult smokers.|$|R
60|$|It must be confessed <b>that</b> <b>Joe's</b> {{heart sank}} within {{him as he}} {{reviewed}} the situation. Where he was he could not tell, nor could he form any definite plan for rejoining his cousin and old Benson. More than this, {{he was afraid that}} the desperadoes might come up at any minute and pounce upon him.|$|R
50|$|Joe is very {{encouraging}} as a coach. The other team appears {{in white and}} black, which are the colours <b>that</b> <b>Joe's</b> team wears. Joe's team express their anger at this and respond by taking their shirts off {{so that they are}} able to distinguish between players. The other team scores the first goal of the game.|$|R
5|$|Stringer also struggles, {{having been}} cut off by Avon's drug {{suppliers}} and left with increasingly poor-quality product. He again goes behind Avon's back, giving up half of Avon's most prized territory to a rival named Proposition Joe {{in exchange for a}} share of his supply. Avon, unaware of the arrangement, assumes <b>that</b> <b>Joe</b> and other dealers are moving into his territory simply because the Barksdale organization has too few enforcers. He contracts a feared assassin named Brother Mouzone. Stringer deals with this by tricking his old adversary Omar into believing that Mouzone was responsible for the vicious killing of his partner in their feud in season one. Seeking revenge, Omar shoots Mouzone but, realizing Stringer has lied to him, calls 9-1-1. Mouzone recovers and leaves Baltimore, and Stringer (now with Avon's consent) is able to continue his arrangement with Proposition Joe.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Samoa Joe and Booker T ended after Hard Justice. On the August14 {{episode of}} TNA Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Joe</b> would defend the championship at TNA's next PPV event No Surrender on September14 in a Four Ways to Glory match. Cornette stated {{that over the}} weeks leading to the show three qualification matches would take place to determine the challengers to Joe. Booker T won the first qualifying match was on the August21 episode of Impact! by defeating Rhino. Kurt Angle defeated Kevin Nash on the August28 episode of Impact! {{to qualify for the}} contest.

Booker T could not attend the event due to Hurricane Ike, making the bout a Three Ways to Glory match instead. Joe retained the championship at the show.|$|E
5|$|At TNA's {{previous}} No Surrender PPV {{event on}} September14, Sting announced that TNA management {{had decided that}} he would challenge the TNA World Heavyweight Champion for the title at Bound for Glory. Later in the show, Joe defeated Christian Cage and Angle in a Three Ways to Glory match to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship after Jarrett interfered in the bout by bashing a guitar over Angle's head. Following No Surrender on the September18 episode of Impact!, Sting discussed his actions further, stating that when he was younger he learned from the veterans in the industry and <b>that</b> <b>Joe</b> and Styles had been disrespectful in their rivalries with Booker T and Angle. Jarrett responded to Sting's comments later in the show, stating that the issue was not about disrespect, it was about the veterans in the company not wanting to retire and let the younger wrestlers be stars. Angle argued that he made TNA a success, not the efforts of Jarrett, Sting, Joe, or Styles. Angle then challenged Jarrett to a match at Bound for Glory IV, which Jarrett declined. On the September25 episode of Impact!, Angle challenged Jarrett to a match again, this time threatening and mocking him along with his daughters. Jarrett accepted Angle's challenge afterwards. Sting also expressed his reasons for having a desire to face Joe for the title on the same telecast, stating that he was taught respect by veterans in his youth so he was going to defeat Joe for the championship at Bound for Glory to teach Joe respect. Mick Foley was announced as the Special Ringside Enforcer for the Jarrett versus Angle bout on the October2 Impact! episode. Sting and Joe signed the contract for their encounter on the October9 episode of Impact!, with the stipulation added {{that there would be no}} rematch between the two after the event regardless of the outcome.|$|E
60|$|I {{have reason}} to think <b>that</b> <b>Joe's</b> intellects were brightened by the {{encounter}} they had passed through, and that {{on our way to}} Pumblechook's he invented a subtle and deep design. My reason {{is to be found in}} what took place in Mr. Pumblechook's parlor: where, on our presenting ourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.|$|R
