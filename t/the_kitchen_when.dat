500|$|Many reviews complimented the episode's songs. Huffington Post {{reviewer}} Mike Moody {{noted that}} both the dry humor in the episode and its songs were humorous, writing, [...] "I usually find myself heading to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>when</b> the songs come on -- but I usually glance back at the TV to see if Jemaine is making a funny face – and I rush back to the couch once the last note drops.

5000|$|Steerpike's backstory was amended for the TV series. In Titus Groan he {{had only}} been in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{for a few weeks}} before making his escape, while on TV in a {{monologue}} to his monkey in episode 4, Steerpike stated that he was sent to <b>the</b> <b>kitchens</b> <b>when</b> he was six, suffering various abuses at the hands of Swelter.

2500|$|Though {{initially}} operant {{behavior is}} emitted without an identified {{reference to a}} particular stimulus, during operant conditioning operants come {{under the control of}} stimuli that are present when behavior is reinforced. Such stimuli are called [...] "discriminative stimuli." [...] A so-called [...] "three-term contingency" [...] is the result. That is, discriminative stimuli set the occasion for responses that produce reward or punishment. Thus, a rat may be trained to press a lever only when a light comes on; a dog rushes to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>when</b> it hears the rattle of its food bag; a child reaches for candy when she sees it on a table.|$|E

[...] She later told Inside Soap that the storyline was [...] "really exciting", calling it [...] "cleverly written so no one knows who Kat's secret lover is—not even me or the mystery man himself. I love coming into work every day and discovering even more brilliant twists to the plot!" [...] She added, [...] "Everyone is going to love the excitement of the storyline. The scriptwriters have been brilliant at putting everyone in the frame. I can't wait to find out who it is!", and said that Kat loves being the centre of attention when she charms each of the suspects to join the football team, especially as her marriage to Alfie has lost its spark. She said that [...] "Alfie has always loved Kat's sexy side, so he doesn't see any harm in [...] It's just that Kat doesn't think he has the same interest in her that he used to. Alfie just seems content with domestic life, and the passion has gone." [...] Speaking of Kat's motivation for the affair, Wallace told Inside Soap that [...] "Kat feels deflated, as [...] haven't had much alone time lately, but her mood is soon lifted when she hears the football lads chanting her name and goes back down to the bar.
