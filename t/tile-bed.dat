40|$|There exist exactly 4044 topological {{types of}} 4 -colorable <b>tile-</b> 4 -transitive tilings of the plane. These can be {{obtained}} by systematic application of two geometric algorithms, edge-contraction and vertex-truncation, to all <b>tile-</b> 3 transitive tilings of the plane. 1 Introduction It is well established that there exist precisely 93 equivariant types of tiletransitive tilings of the euclidean plane, grouped in 11 topological families (the so-called Laves nets). The 508 topological types of (normal) <b>tile-</b> 2 transitive tilings are listed in [GLST 85]. The 1270 (or 2268, if digons are permitted) equivariant types of <b>tile-</b> 2 -transitive tilings of the plane are systematically classified in [DHZ 92]. The theory of Delaney symbols (or-more appropriately- Delaney-Dress symbols) introduced by A. Dress {{has proven to be a}} very useful approach to classification problems concerning tilings, see [Dre 84] or [Dre 87]. In [Hus 93 a] the author uses this method to formulate two geometric algorithms GLUE and SPLIT ba [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{classifying}} the convex pentagons that admit tilings {{of the plane}} is a long-standing unsolved problem. Previous to this article, there were 14 known distinct kinds of convex pentagons that admit tilings of the plane. Five of these types admit tile-transitive tilings (i. e. {{there is a single}} transitivity class with respect to the symmetry group of the tiling). The remaining 9 types do not admit tile-transitive tilings, but do admit either 2 -block transitive tilings or 3 -block transitive tilings; these are tilings comprised of clusters of 2 or 3 pentagons such that these clusters form <b>tile-</b> 2 -transitive or <b>tile-</b> 3 -transitive tilings. In this article, we present some combinatorial results concerning pentagons that admit i-block transitive tilings for i ∈N. These results form the basis for an automated approach to finding all pentagons that admit i-block transitive tilings for each i ∈N. We will present the methods of this algorithm and the results of the computer searches so far, which includes a complete classification of all pentagons admitting 1 -, 2 -, and 3 -block transitive tilings, among which is a new 15 th type of convex pentagon that admits a <b>tile-</b> 3 -transitive tiling...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. 3 D quasiperiodic tilings {{derived from}} {{deformed}} cuboctahedra are obtained by projection from 7 D or 6 D lattice space to 3 D tile-space. Lattice matrices defining the projections from 7 D or 6 D lattice space to <b>tile-</b> and test-space are given by introducing a deformation parameter. Two types of lattice matrices are considered, orthonormal and row-wise orthogonal, both are corresponding to deformation of a cuboctahedron along the z-direction but {{the latter is}} corresponding to uniform deformation. Both 3 D and 2 D tilings are investigated though the latter is merely derived as a degenerate case of the former. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an algorithm {{which has been}} developed to extract fine granularity information from an electromagnetic calorimeter with strip-based readout. Such a calorimeter, based on scintillator strips, is being developed to apply particle flow reconstruction to future experiments in high energy physics. Tests of this algorithm in full detector simulations, using strips of size 45 x 5 mm^ 2 show that the performance is close {{to that of a}} calorimeter with true 5 x 5 mm^ 2 readout granularity. The performance can be further improved by the use of 10 x 10 mm^ 2 <b>tile-</b> shaped layers interspersed between strip layers. Comment: 11 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
25|$|Auxiliary regiments were {{normally}} attached, for operational purposes, to {{a particular}} legion. The praefectus (commander) of the regiment would report to the legatus legionis (legion commander). Auxiliary regiments were mostly housed in Roman forts in frontier provinces or even beyond the empire's settled borders, to keep watch on barbarian activity. A regiment would usually garrison a fort alone, but sometimes shared with another regiment {{if it was a}} larger fort. More rarely, regiments appear to have been housed in the castra legionaria (legionary fortress) of the legion they were attached to. Although inscriptions, especially the regiment's <b>tile-</b> and brick-stamps, can attest which forts the regiment occupied, most are not datable and so it is rarely possible to reconstruct a precise sequence or chronology of forts occupied.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} this mosque was {{for it to be}} a private mosque of the royal court, unlike the Shah Mosque, which was meant for the public. For this reason, the mosque does not have any minarets and is of a smaller size. Indeed, few Westerners {{at the time of the}} Safavids even paid any {{attention}} to this mosque, and they certainly did not have access to it. It wasn't until centuries later, when the doors were opened to the public, that ordinary people could admire the effort that Shah Abbas had put into making this a sacred place for the ladies of his harem, and the exquisite <b>tile-</b> work, which is far superior to those covering the Shah Mosque.|$|R

Work is executed in accord with strict customer requirements and fully integrated into large IPTV platform. It takes form of a complex start-up menu, whose first section is an interactive tile grid with <b>tile-</b> scaled video player. Other sections contain smaller applications or sub-sections. We build upon modules that transform data sources into tiles. They are then pro- jected to horizontal carousels according to dynamic configuration. A well defined interface to integrate new modules is provided. Almost twenty different modules are ready for immediate use. They provide various parametrized tiles such as live programmes that can be directly started or recorded. Our user interface layer, using React and Redux libraries, leverages the single page application paradigm. For predictability, any modification of application state is made by emitting ac- tions handled solely by pure functions. Set-top box performance issues forced us to implement an immutable state optimization that cut the average render time of our React components {{by more than a}} half. i...|$|R

The archive contains 72, 213 images from the San Francisco Fine Arts Museums and is the largest database of on-line art in the world. We describe our system, what we learned, and how these lessons {{can be used by}} other web-based archives. We use our experiences to address questions about this type of site. First, what are users are looking for? We describe the user access patterns. Second, how does the choice of user interface affect the system? We describe how well caching works within our user interface and how our access patterns are affected by the interface's style. Third, how good are the web server and underlying file system at caching a <b>tile-</b> based image workload? We estimate the cache hit ratio for our site. Finally, how much availability do users expect? We describe the failures we have experienced, and describe how much availability is needed from a web site.

40|$|Coral {{settlement}} {{is a key}} ecological process in the maintenance, recovery and resilience of coral reef ecosystems. Coral reefs in the Persian Gulf survive {{in one of the}} world's most extreme environments, yet there remains limited knowledge of the role of coral settlement considered critical for maintaining population dynamics. Spatial and temporal patterns of coral settlement were examined at 6 sites in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, using settlement tiles deployed and collected every 3 mo from 2009 to 2011 following coral community surveys. Settlement was highly seasonal with the highest settlement rates between June and August (3. 2 spat <b>tile-</b> 1 ± 0. 21 SE), when summer sea temperatures approached 35 °C. There was a smaller settlement pulse between September and November, but no settlement between December and May. Settlement was observed 1 to 4 mo after the major spawning season (April and May), suggesting either delayed settlement of larvae, or spatial and/or taxonomic disparity between studies of reproduction versus settlement. Settlement rates varied significantly among sites, but spatial variation was consistent between the 2 years of the study, suggesting strong effects of local environmental conditions or local coral assemblages. Poritidae and Acroporidae comprised 27 and 11 % of the spat respectively, there were no Pocilloporidae and the most abundant coral spat (61 %) were from other, not identifiable, families. These data indicate that observed long-term shifts in the community structure of adult coral assemblages are being reinforced through a combination of settlement and post-settlement processes, such that there is limited scope for recovery of former Acroporadominated coral assemblages in the Persian Gulf...|$|R
