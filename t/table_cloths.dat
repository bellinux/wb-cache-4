The feral billy goats were wont to interfere with these nanny goats and this was another reason for their demise.|$|E

25|$|Mason {{was born}} in 1808 in Mystic, Connecticut, {{the son of a}} blacksmith. As a boy, Mason spent time in his father's shops. He left home at the age of {{thirteen}} and worked as an operator in the spinning room of a small cotton factory in Canterbury, Connecticut. He was a born mechanical genius and could repair the most complicated machine in the mill. At the age of sixteen he went to East Haddam, where a mill for the manufacture of thread was being established, to start the machines. At seventeen he worked at the machine shop connected with the mill, where he stayed for three years. It was here he set up the first power loom in the country for the manufacture of diaper linen. He also constructed an ingenious loom for the weaving of damask <b>table</b> <b>cloths.</b>|$|E
2500|$|By the 16th century, Oriental carpets {{were often}} {{depicted}} in still life paintings. Assorted valuable, exotic objects like Chinese porcelain bowls and animals like parrots are depicted, often with an allegorical meaning, or symbolizing [...] "vanitas", {{the futility of}} human life. The allusion to futility is made apparent by the inclusion of symbols like a human skull, or inscriptions quoting the biblical book of Ecclesiastes [...] As early as 1533, Hans Holbein's painting [...] "The Ambassadors" [...] prominently shows an anamorphic projection of a human skull. Objects in still lifes, regardless of their allegorical meaning, are often placed on precious velvet <b>table</b> <b>cloths,</b> marble plates, or oriental carpets. As such, Oriental carpets are treated similar to other precious objects or materials, the focus being on their material value and decorative effect.|$|E
2500|$|As in the {{previous}} instalments, Stuart Craig and Stephenie McMillan provided the film's art and set designs, respectively. Due to the film's scope, there were many new sets and transformations of old sets created. McMillan was most excited about redesigning the Great Hall for the scenes involving the Yule Ball. [...] "Originally we thought silver curtains, silver <b>table</b> <b>cloths</b> and an ice dance floor," [...] said McMillan, [...] "but it just went on and on. The drapes man eventually said, 'Why not just stick the fabrics on the wall?'" [...] Each task of the Triwizard Tournament required massive sets. The rock quarry set for the first task, where Harry faces off with the Hungarian Horntail, was built in two sections at Leavesden Studios. Craig called it [...] "one of the biggest sets we've ever built {{for any of the}} films." [...] For the second task, involving the film's underwater scenes, the film crew designed and built a blue screen tank holding [...] "about half a million gallons of water." [...] As for the final task, which took place in the maze, hedge walls ranging from 20 to 40 feet tall were constructed and enhanced with computer-generated imagery.|$|E

2500|$|Still, {{despite the}} {{popularity}} of the events {{that took place in the}} building, negative first impressions of Rideau Hall itself were a theme until the early part of the 20th century. Upon arrival there in 1872, the Countess of Dufferin said in her journal: [...] "We have been so very enthusiastic about everything hitherto that the first sight of Rideau Hall did lower our spirits just a little!" [...] In 1893, Lady Stanley, wife of Governor General the Lord Stanley of Preston, said [...] "you will find the furniture in the rooms very old-fashioned & not very pretty... The red drawing room... had no furniture except chairs & tables... The walls are absolutely bare... The room which has always been the wife of the G.G.'s sitting room is very empty... There are no lamps in the house at all. No cushions, no <b>table</b> <b>cloths,</b> in fact none of the small things that make a room pretty & comfortable." [...] Echoing these earlier comments, the Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair said upon her departure from Ottawa that Rideau Hall was a [...] "shabby old Government House put away amongst its clump of bushes..." ...|$|E

[...] "We must move the furniture out of this room and set the supper-table here. The dining-room is too small. We must borrow Mrs. Bell's forks and spoons. She offered to lend them. I'd never have been willing to ask her. The damask <b>table</b> <b>cloths</b> with the ribbon pattern must be bleached to-morrow. Nobody else in Avonlea has such tablecloths. And we'll put the little dining-room table on the hall landing, upstairs, for the presents." ...|$|E

Our Aunt Hancock lived in the Governor's house, on Beacon Hill, at that time." [...] Here the old lady bridled up still more, for she was very proud of [...] "our aunt." [...] "Ah, my dears, those were the good old times!" [...] she continued, with a sigh. [...] "Such dinners and tea parties, such damask <b>table</b> <b>cloths</b> and fine plate, such solid, handsome furniture and elegant carriages; aunt's was lined with red silk velvet, and when the coach was taken away from her at the Governor's death, she just ripped out the lining, and we girls had spencers made of it. Dear heart, how well I remember playing in aunt's great garden, and chasing Jack up and down those winding stairs; and my blessed father, in his plum-colored coat and knee buckles, and the queue I used to tie up for him every day, handing aunt in to dinner, looking so dignified and splendid." ...|$|E

60|$|There {{are several}} very nice hotels in Dover, {{but the one}} which the porter {{referred}} to {{is one of the}} finest and most beautifully situated hotels in Europe. It is a large and handsome edifice, built in modern style, and it stands close to the railroad station, on a point of land overlooking the sea. The coffee room, which, unlike other English coffee rooms, is used by both ladies and gentlemen, is a very spacious and splendidly decorated apartment, with large windows on three sides of it, overlooking the sea and the neighboring coasts. Each sash of these windows is glazed with one single pane of plate glass, so that whether they are shut or open there is nothing to intercept the view. The room is furnished with a great number of tables, each large enough to accommodate parties of four or six, and all, except two or three {{in different parts of the}} room that are reserved for reading and writing, are covered with neat white <b>table</b> <b>cloths,</b> and other preparations more or less advanced for breakfasts or dinners that may have been ordered, while at almost all times of the day, a greater or less number of them are occupied by parties of tourists, their bags and baskets lying on the neighboring chairs.|$|E

30|$|The along-strike maximum {{compression}} {{observed in}} sectors 2, 3, and 4 (top 90 km) {{can be explained}} by the “tablecloth effect” or membrane strain model (e.g., Creager et al., 1995). According to this model, the slab geometry is analogous to a <b>table</b> <b>cloth</b> draped over the corner of a table, producing a slab with too much material (pleats in the <b>table</b> <b>cloth)</b> to fit around the corner, developing compressive along-strike membrane strains or geometric buckling. More data are needed in terms of precise earthquake locations and moment tensor solutions in order to shed light on the finer details of the slab’s geometry and stress variations along the Hellenic arc.|$|R
