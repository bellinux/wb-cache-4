Ranpur has remained as a vassal kingdom of the Surya dynasty of Odisha which had famous kings like Kapilendra Deva, Purushottama Deva and Prataparudra Deva. After 1568, when Odisha fell to <b>the</b> <b>Afghans</b> of Bengal, <b>the</b> rulers showed their allegiance to <b>the</b> <b>Afghans.</b> Shortly afterwards in 1592, Odisha {{became part of the}} Mughal Empire after the successful military campaign of Man Singh against <b>the</b> <b>Afghans</b> of Bengal. <b>The</b> rulers of Ranpur again showed allegiance to the Mughals.|$|R

5|$|According to {{a legend}} King Indradyumma was {{directed}} by Lord Jagannath in a dream to build a temple for him which he did as directed. However, according to historical records the temple was started some time during the 12th century by King Chodaganga of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. It was completed by his descendant, Anangabhima Deva, in the 12th century. The wooden images of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra were then deified here. The temple was {{under the control of}} the Hindu rulers up to 1558. Then, when Orissa was occupied by <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> Nawab of Bengal, it was brought under the control of <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> General Kalapahad. Following the defeat of <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> king by Raja Mansingh, the General of Mughal emperor Akbar, the temple became part of the Mughal empire till 1751. Subsequently, it was {{under the control of the}} Marathas till 1803. During the British Raj, the Puri Raja was entrusted with its management until 1947.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to pacify}} the population, Amin {{released}} {{a list of}} 18,000 {{people who had been}} executed, and blamed the executions on Taraki. The total number of arrested during Taraki's and Amin's combined reign number between 17,000 and 45,000. Amin was not liked by <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> people. During his rule, opposition to the communist regime increased, and the government lost control of the countryside. The state of <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> military deteriorated; due to desertions the number of military personnel in <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> army decreased from 100,000 {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Saur Revolution, to somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000. Another problem Amin faced was the KGB's penetration of the PDPA, the military and the government bureaucracy. While Amin's position in Afghanistan was becoming more perilous by the day, his enemies who were exiled in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc were agitating for his removal. Babrak Karmal, the Parchamite leader, met several leading Eastern Bloc figures during this period, and Mohammad Aslam Watanjar, Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy and Assadullah Sarwari wanted to exact revenge upon Amin.|$|E

Meanwhile, Sabaji Scindia (Shinde) reached the place with fresh troops and a large number of Sikh fighters.

5|$|Canada's {{military}} involvement in Afghanistan began in 2002 with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), a coalition of soldiers from 42 countries, which was tasked as a counterinsurgency effort {{in response to the}} September 11 attacks. ISAF had initially been established as a stabilization force by the United Nations Security Council on 20 December 2001, to secure Kabul. The Canadian Liberal government at the time, under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, chose to have the Canadian Forces (CF) hand over its prisoners to the United States, who led the fight against al-Qaeda and other insurgents. After NATO took command of Afghanistan in 2003, Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse {{at the hands of the}} United States armed forces in Iraq came to the attention of the public, and Canada soon faced pressure to hand their prisoners to someone else. Canada entered into an agreement with <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> government and started transferring detainees to Afghan security forces, which comprised <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> National Army (ANA) and <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> National Directorate of Security (NDS).|$|E

50|$|In September 1507, while marching from Kabul to India, Babur {{went through}} Little Kabul. On {{reaching}} Robat-i-Surkh, he passed Kuruk Sai by the hilliard pass. <b>The</b> <b>Afghans</b> living between Kabul and Laghman knew that Babur {{was trying to}} make his escape, and so decided to attack him. When Babur marched out from Jegdalek, <b>the</b> <b>Afghans</b> of Khizrkhel, Shimukhel, Ghilzai or Khilji and Khogyani formed plans of obstructing his march through the Lataband Pass and on the hill which lay {{to the north of the}} Lataband Pass. They beat their drums and brandished their swords raising terrific shouts. Babur ordered the troops to ascend the hill and attack the enemy each in the direction nearest to him. His troops advanced and made their way through different valleys and by any approach possible. They got nearer to them, and <b>the</b> <b>Afghans</b> immediately took flight without even shooting an arrow. After driving off <b>the</b> <b>Afghans</b> he reached <b>the</b> top of the ascent. He halted in Nangarhar before the fort of Jalalabad. Here, he separated the army into four divisions who were to move about, some up the country and others down till he received intelligence of both <b>the</b> <b>Afghans</b> and <b>the</b> Uzbeks.|$|R

Within several months Taraki began denouncing <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> government under King Zahir Shah and accused it of being autocratic and dictatorial. His denunciation of <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> government earned him much publicity in the United States. It also attracted unfavorable attention from authorities back home, who relieved him of his post and ordered him repatriated but stopped short of placing him under arrest. After {{a short period of}} unemployment Taraki started working for the United States Overseas Mission in Kabul as an interpreter. He quit that job in 1958 and established his own translation company, the Noor Translation Bureau. Four years later, he started working for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, but quit in 1963 to focus on the establishment of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), a communist political party.|$|E

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1915, an Indo-German {{expedition}} was sent to Afghanistan via the overland route through Persia. Led by the exiled Indian prince Raja Mahendra Pratap, this mission sought to invite <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> Emir Habibullah Khan to break with Britain, declare his independence, join the war on the Central side, and invade British India. It managed to evade the considerable Anglo-Russian efforts that were directed at intercepting it in Mesopotamia and in the Persian deserts before it reached Afghanistan in August 1915. In Afghanistan, it was joined in Kabul {{by members of the}} pan-Islamic group Darul Uloom Deoband led by Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi. This group had left India for Kabul {{at the beginning of the}} war while another group under Mahmud al-Hasan made its way to Hijaz, where they hoped to seek support from <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> Emir, the Ottoman Empire and Imperial Germany for a pan-Islamic insurrection beginning in the tribal belt of north-west India. The Indo-German mission pressed Emir Habibullah to break from his neutral stance and open diplomatic relations with Germany, eventually hoping to rally the Emir to the German war effort. Habibullah Khan vacillated on the mission's proposals through much of the winter of 1915, hoping to maintain his neutral stance till the course of the war offered a concrete picture. However, the mission opened at this time secret negotiations with the pro-German elements in the Emir's court and advisory council, including his brother Nasrullah Khan and son Amanullah Khan. It found support among Afghan intellectuals, religious leaders and <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> press which rallied with increasingly anti-British and pro-Central articles. By 1916 the Raj was forced to intercept copies of <b>the</b> <b>Afghan</b> newspaper Siraj al Akhbar sent to India. It raised to the Emir a threat of a coup d'état in his country and unrest among his tribesmen, who were beginning to see him as subservient to British authority even as Turkey called for a pan-Islamic Jihad.|$|E
