Upon his accession in 1949 Prince Rainier III immediately began a program of renovation and restoration. Many of the external frescoes on the courtyard were restored, while the southern wing, destroyed following the French revolution, was rebuilt. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of the palace where the ruling family have their private apartments.

Though this was once {{the site of a}} thriving Viking city, the city centre has shifted to the west over the years, and it is now a quiet and tranquil area, dominated by narrow streets, medieval architecture, and civic spaces. Over the past decade, a number of restaurants have opened in High Street and Henrietta Street, taking advantage of the charming character of the area. Much of Waterford's impressive architecture {{is to be found in}} the 'Viking Triangle'.|$|E

25|$|Physical {{activity}} {{has a significant}} influence on the hippocampus, since <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> {{of the brain that}} is responsible for encoding information into memory. With physical activity having such an impact on the hippocampus this can regulate {{other parts of the body}} as well like weight, memory, daily function, and many more processes that are necessary for the body to work. Since physical activity impacts all of these important parts of the brain, this form of exercise keeps the neural networks functioning well. Neural networks allow information to process and pass to the hippocampus in order to retain memory. This lets the brain be more efficient in processing and more memories are stored this way.|$|E
25|$|N - Neuroticism/Stability: Neuroticism or emotionality is {{characterized}} by high levels of negative affect such as depression and anxiety. Neuroticism, according to Eysenck's theory, is based on activation thresholds in the sympathetic nervous system or visceral brain. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> {{of the brain that}} is responsible for the fight-or-flight response in the face of danger. Activation can be measured by heart rate, blood pressure, cold hands, sweating and muscular tension (especially in the forehead). Neurotic people — who have low activation thresholds, and unable to inhibit or control their emotional reactions, experience negative affect (fight-or-flight) in the face of very minor stressors — are easily nervous or upset. Emotionally stable people — who have high activation thresholds and good emotional control, experience negative affect only in the face of very major stressors — are calm and collected under pressure.|$|E
500|$|Sections 14 to 16 {{of the act}} {{set forth}} the coins {{authorized}} to be struck by the Mint Bureau. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of the act that would later prove contentious, as it omitted the standard silver dollar, since 1853 the only coin into which depositors of silver bullion could have their metal struck. It did allow for a Trade dollar, of higher weight than the old coin, that depositors could have their silver made into, but the legal tender of this and all silver coins was limited to $5—the old silver dollar had an unlimited legal tender. All gold coins had unlimited legal tender, and the act made provision for the redemption of gold coin abraded below normal weight at full value, if twenty years or more old and if still containing 99.5 {{percent or more of}} the authorized weight. [...] Lightweight gold coin that did not meet these qualifications would have the loss in value fall upon the depositor.|$|E

[...] Lacroix also commented [...] "If you missed it, get the replay. Don't think, just do it [...] the main event is well worth the price." [...] The main event was given Lacroix's highest match rating of 10 out of 10 in his review. He gave his lowest rating of 4 out of 10 to the opening Six Man Tag Team match. The NWA World Heavyweight Championship bout was ranked with a 7.5 out of 10, while a 7 out of 10 {{was given to the}} NWA World Tag Team Championship contest. Commenting on the main event, Lacroix spoke of it as a [...] "certified match of the year candidate." [...] Going onto describe in detail: [...] "Unbreakable came to a close with mind-boggling main event, featuring a three-way dance between Samoa Joe against AJ Styles against X Division champion Christopher Daniels for the championship title. Now, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> where I go into a detail review of the match, but I'm not going to that. Fact is there is no review that could do justice in describing just how stellar this bout was."

60|$|The {{study of}} books alone, is {{insufficient}} to give knowledge to the young. In the first stage, learning to read, a book is of no use whatever, without {{the voice of the}} living teacher. The child cannot take a step alone. As the pupil, however, advances in his course, his dependence upon his teacher for guidance and help, continually diminishes, until, at last, the scholar sits in his solitary study, with no companion but his books, and desiring, for a solution of every difficulty, nothing but a larger library. In schools, however, the pupils have made so little progress in this course, that they all need more or less of this oral assistance. Difficulties must be explained; questions must be answered; the path must be smoothed, and the way pointed out, by a guide, who has travelled it before, or it will be impossible for the pupil to go on. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of our subject, which we now approach.|$|E

60|$|It must be {{understood}} that a considerable portion of the author's voyages above mentioned is not recorded {{at all in the}} following pages. Of one of its most attractive episodes, the visit to Tahiti, no account was written; while of his experiences in Hawaii only the visit to the Kona coast is included. Several chapters which did not come out to the writer's satisfaction have been omitted. Of the five sections here given, each is complete in itself, with the exception of Part III. The first deals with the Marquesas, the second with the Paumolus--the former a volcanic and mountainous group, the latter a low group of atolls or coral islands, both in the Eastern Pacific and both under the protectorate of France. The third section is fragmentary, and deals, as has been said, with only one portion of the writer's experiences in Hawaii. The last two describe his residence in the Gilberts, a remote and little-known coral group in the Western Pacific, which {{at the time of his}} visit was under independent native government, but has since been annexed by Great Britain. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of his work with which the author himself was best satisfied, and it derives additional interest from describing a state of manners and government which has now passed away.|$|E
60|$|The {{approach}} to the castle is circuitous, until quite near it, when the road enters a little thicket of evergreens, crosses a bridge, and passes beneath an arch to the court, which is paved. The bridge is now permanent, though {{there was once a}} draw, and the grooves of a portcullis are still visible beneath the arch. The shortest side of the square is next the bridge, the building offering here but little more than the two towers, and the room above the gateway. One of these towers forms the end of this front of the castle, and the other is, of course, at an angle. On the exterior, they are both buried in ivy, as well as the building which connects them. This ivy was planted by Charles Fox, who, in company with General Fitzpatrick, visited Lagrange, after the peace of Amiens. The windows, which are small and irregular on this side, open beautifully through the thick foliage, and as <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> of the structure that is occupied by the children of the family, their blooming faces thrust through the leafy apertures have a singularly pleasing effect. The other three towers stand, one near the centre of the principal corps de bâtiment, one at the other angle, and the third {{at the end of the}} wing opposite that of the gate. The towers vary in size, and are all more or less buried in the walls, though still so distinct as greatly to relieve the latter, and everywhere to rise above them. On the open side of the court there is no ditch, but the ground, which is altogether park-like, and beautifully arranged, falls away, dotted with trees and copses, towards a distant thicket.|$|E
60|$|But, {{during the}} early stages of this process, some of the Pieridae, inhabiting the same district, {{happened}} to be sufficiently like some of the Heliconidae to be occasionally mistaken for them. These, of course, survived while their companions were devoured. Those among their descendants that were still more like Heliconidae again survived, and at length the imitation would become tolerably perfect. Thereafter, as the protected group diverged into distinct species of many different colours, the imitative group would occasionally be able to follow it with similar variations,--a process that is going on now, for Mr. Bates informs us that in each fresh district he visited he found closely allied representative species or varieties of Heliconidae, and along with them species of Leptalis (Pieridae), which had varied in the same way so as still to be exact imitations. But this process of imitation would be subject to check by the increasing acuteness of birds and other animals which, whenever the eatable Leptalis became numerous, would surely find them out, and would then probably attack both these and their friends the Heliconidae in order to devour the former and reject the latter. The Pieridae would, however, usually be less numerous, because their larvae are often protectively coloured and therefore edible, while the larvae of the Heliconidae are adorned with warning colours, spines, or tubercles, and are uneatable. It seems probable that the larvae and pupae of the Heliconidae were the first to acquire the protective distastefulness, both because in this stage they are more defenceless and more liable to fatal injury, and also because we now find many instances in which the larvae are distasteful while the perfect insects are eatable, but I believe none in which the reverse is the case. The larvae of the Pieridae are now beginning to acquire offensive juices, but have not yet obtained the corresponding conspicuous colours; while the perfect insects remain eatable, except perhaps in some Eastern groups, the under sides of whose wings are brilliantly coloured although <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> which is exposed when at rest.|$|E
