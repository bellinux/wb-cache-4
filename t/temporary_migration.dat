5|$|New Zealand has {{a strong}} {{presence}} among the Pacific Island countries. A large proportion of New Zealand's aid goes to these countries and many Pacific people migrate to New Zealand for employment. Permanent migration is regulated under the 1970 Samoan Quota Scheme and the 2002 Pacific Access Category, which allow up to 1,100 Samoan nationals and up to 750 other Pacific Islanders respectively to become permanent New Zealand residents each year. A seasonal workers scheme for <b>temporary</b> <b>migration</b> was introduced in 2007 and in 2009 about 8,000 Pacific Islanders were employed under it. New Zealand {{is involved in the}} Pacific Islands Forum, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum (including the East Asia Summit). New Zealand {{is a member of the}} United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and participates in the Five Power Defence Arrangements.|$|E

It encouraged various races of different languages and religious backgrounds to intermingle and to live side by side. Following the growth of Singaporean nationhood and national identity, the Chinese immigrants began to change their mindset from <b>temporary</b> <b>migration</b> to permanent settlements, thus soiling their roots in Singapore. With the strengthening of Singaporean national identity, the Chinese clans association gradually declined in terms of importance.

25|$|Throughout {{much of the}} 20th century, a {{great deal}} of {{circular}} migration existed between the United States and Mexico. In general, this movement was seasonal migration spurred by the agricultural sector, and border crossings were frequently undocumented {{due to the lack of}} a border patrol. From 1942 to 1964, the Bracero Program facilitated the <b>temporary</b> <b>migration</b> of more than 4 million workers, often for multiple contracts that allowed for them to return repeatedly to the United States. Following this, the United States shifted towards stricter border control and began to grant fewer visas, disrupting the trend of circular migration. Because of the risks associated with illegal immigration, many former circular migrants began to settle permanently in the United States, though circular migration is still a common phenomenon in U.S.-Mexico immigration relations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Temporary</b> labour <b>migration</b> {{programs}} are often proposed {{as a way}} to provide the benefits of migration in general, while mitigating the allegedly problematic effects of permanent migration. Here I propose that the arguments deployed in favour of <b>temporary</b> labour <b>migration</b> over permanent migration are flawed, normatively, and that empirically <b>temporary</b> labour <b>migration</b> programs produce effects in receiving states that are even worse than those (allegedly) produced by permanent migration. As a result, I shall argue that, for reasons of consistency, advocates of restricting permanent migration should support restricting <b>temporary</b> labour <b>migration</b> programs as well. I conclude not by arguing that <b>temporary</b> labour <b>migration</b> programs should be abandoned, but rather that we must focus more seriously on re-constructing <b>temporary</b> labour <b>migration</b> programs that do not produce these dilemmas, as well as on generating policies that alleviate the challenges they often pose in receiving societies...|$|R
30|$|Faist and Fauser (2011) {{highlight}} {{important changes}} in migration paradigms: they notice {{the desirability of}} <b>temporary</b> labour <b>migration</b> based on the expectation that temporary migrants will constitute no loss in human capital and furthermore transmit {{a higher percentage of}} their income than permanent immigrants. Such <b>temporary</b> labour <b>migration</b> can also help to spread the benefits of migration widely and create familiarities with destination countries. <b>Temporary</b> labour <b>migration</b> can help Pacific Islanders acquire skills, knowledge and insights that can become crucial when they later have to leave their home countries for good.|$|R

25|$|Current {{migration}} policy rarely {{takes into account}} circular migration, instead mainly focusing on the dichotomous concepts of “permanent” and “temporary.” In contrast to <b>temporary</b> <b>migration,</b> circular migration allows the worker to simultaneously be engaged with both the home and host countries. Furthermore, it typically involves both return to the country of origin and repeated moves to the destination country. In many ways, being connected to both places provides an advantage for the migrant worker, {{because they do not}} have to make a definitive choice to stay in one. This allows for the maximization of capabilities, a concept articulated by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. By working in a high-income location with better earnings and spending in low-income, low-cost countries, the migrant worker is able to realize the best capabilities for both themselves and their families. Circularity also allows for the maintenance of traditions, citizenship, and family, an important part of human capabilities.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} several costs {{associated}} with circular migration. One of these is brain drain, where a migrant who migrates because of skills or education creates a loss of human resources {{in the country of}} origin. These highly skilled workers are in demand in the more developed countries, where in some areas the barriers to immigration have been reduced to allow for both permanent and <b>temporary</b> <b>migration.</b> At the same time, barriers against unskilled workers have been strengthened. The ability to use skills also varies and can constitute a cost to the migrant and the economy, If the migrants had unskilled jobs while working abroad, they will have little experience that will {{contribute to the development of}} their home country upon return. Additionally, even if the worker learned new technical or industrial skills, they may not be able to use them if their country of origin does not have the infrastructure or institutional framework to support them. Circular migration also has a social impact on the families of migrant workers. If labor migrants have children, these minors may be temporarily abandoned while their parents are abroad working. This issue is problematic and some authorities have begun to formulate policies to monitor the situation.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of social, {{economic}} and political change, and of a continuing fall in the real cost of travel, <b>temporary</b> <b>migrations</b> to London, as to other major cities in the global North, have become increasingly common. Indeed, some have speculated that they may come to replace permanent migrations. This trend has intersected with 'informalization' of lower-status jobs in some cities of the global North, including London, and the general depression of migrant wages in low-end jobs in the formal sector. In this context, debate has developed {{about the role of}} <b>temporary</b> <b>migrations</b> in migrants' long-term and short-term strategies, and about their impact on host societies. Drawing on a sustainable livelihoods approach the short-term and long-term life strategies and livelihood strategies of 60 Colombian and Polish bicycle rickshaw ('pedicab') riders in London are analysed and compared. Despite the differences in the status of the two groups, findings are that both groups develop and draw on cultural and social capital in the workplace to facilitate dealings with the local economy and polity; both have had an influence on the local economic sector in which they operate; and both migrate temporarily as part of a life strategy at home, as part of which their migrations have a touristic and cultural, as well as instrumental purpose. ...|$|R

The Royal Navy's first submarine, Holland 1, was built in 1901, and by 1914 the UK had the most advanced submarine fleet in the world, with 94% of it constructed by Vickers. Vickers was also famous for the construction of airships and airship hangars during the early 20th century. Originally constructed in a large shed at Cavendish Dock, production later relocated to Barrow/Walney Island Airport. HMA No. 1, nicknamed the Mayfly is the most notable airship to have been built in Barrow. The first {{of its kind in the}} UK it came to an untimely end on 24 September 1911 when it was wrecked by wind during trials.

6000|$|So {{she went}} out {{and made her way}} into Grosvenor Square. She had heard, but at the time remembered nothing, of the <b>temporary</b> <b>migration</b> of the Melmottes to Bruton Street. Seeing, as she {{approached}} the house, that there was a confusion there of carts and workmen, she hesitated. But she went on, and rang the bell at the door, which was wide open. Within the hall the pilasters and trophies, the wreaths and the banners, which three or four days since had been built up with so much trouble, were now being pulled down and hauled away. And amidst the ruins Melmotte himself was standing. He was now a member of Parliament, and was to take his place that night in the House. Nothing, at any rate, should prevent that. It might be but for a short time;--but it should be written in the history of his life that he had sat in the British House of Commons as member for Westminster. At the present moment he was careful to show himself everywhere. It was now noon, and he had already been into the City. At this moment he was talking to the contractor for the work,--having just propitiated that man by a payment which would hardly have been made so soon but for the necessity which these wretched stories had entailed upon him of keeping up his credit for the possession of money. Hetta timidly asked one of the workmen whether Miss Melmotte was there. 'Do you want my daughter?' said Melmotte coming forward, and just touching his hat. 'She is not living here at present.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Species of {{different}} genera and classes {{have not changed}} at the same rate, or in the same degree. In the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may still {{be found in the}} midst of a multitude of extinct forms. Falconer has given a striking instance of a similar fact, in an existing crocodile associated with many strange and lost mammals and reptiles in the sub-Himalayan deposits. The Silurian Lingula differs but little from the living species of this genus; whereas most of the other Silurian Molluscs and all the Crustaceans have changed greatly. The productions of the land seem to change at a quicker rate than those of the sea, of which a striking instance has lately been observed in Switzerland. There is some reason to believe that organisms, considered high in the scale of nature, change more quickly than those that are low: though there are exceptions to this rule. The amount of organic change, as Pictet has remarked, does not strictly correspond with the succession of our geological formations; so that between each two consecutive formations, the forms of life have seldom changed in exactly the same degree. Yet if we compare any but the most closely related formations, all the species will be found to have undergone some change. When a species has once disappeared from the face of the earth, we have reason to believe that the same identical form never reappears. The strongest apparent exception to this latter rule, is that of the so-called [...] "colonies" [...] of M. Barrande, which intrude for a period {{in the midst of a}}n older formation, and then allow the pre-existing fauna to reappear; but Lyell's explanation, namely, that it is a case of <b>temporary</b> <b>migration</b> from a distinct geographical province, seems to me satisfactory. {314} ...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} <b>temporary</b> skilled <b>migration</b> in Australia is {{relatively}} new. As a rapidly emerging source of labour and settlers for Australia's immigration programme, <b>temporary</b> skilled <b>migration</b> {{will have a}} major and potentially long-lasting impact on Australia. Since the mid- 1990 s, <b>temporary</b> skilled <b>migration</b> (under the subclass 457 visa programme) has overtaken permanent migration to Australia.

50|$|Brain Drain {{literature}} focuses {{mainly on}} {{the high cost of}} skilled migration for the homeland or sending country. This loss can be partly offset if the migration is only temporary.

This flow of capital plus the additional knowledge gained would do more than compensate the homeland for the investment made originally in educating the skilled worker. The key to <b>temporary</b> <b>migration</b> is a change in the trade and immigration policies of the receiving country and a stepping-up of the demands of the sending country for the return migration of skilled workers.|$|E

We consider three motives for a temporary migration: Differences in relative prices in host- and home country, complementarities between consumption and the location where consumption takes place, and the possibility of accumulating human capital abroad which enhances the immigrant's earnings potential back home. For the last return motive, we discuss extensions which allow for immigrant heterogeneity, and develop implications for selective in- and out- migration...|$|R
