5|$|Lake {{initially}} thought Microsoft was {{not particularly}} enthusiastic about the idea, but had accepted the pitch mainly because of Microsoft's vision of having Xbox One as an entertainment device with rich TV features at that time. However, as <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>show</b> {{was not part of}} Microsoft's project, the closure of Xbox Entertainment Studios did not affect the progress of <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>show</b> production. It was created by Lifeboat Productions, who worked closely with Remedy through Skype conversation and screenplay review. Many scenes had to be shot twice due to the game's alternate content and branching nature. Three writers from Remedy also contributed to <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>show</b> content.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1999, a live {{production}} of Blue's Clues toured the U.S. to positive reviews. Johnson compared the show's audience participation {{with that of}} The Rocky Horror Picture Show. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances. The creators of <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>show</b> were involved {{in all aspects of}} the live show, aiming to translate the bond between the TV show's audience and its cast to the stage and to provide young audiences with their first theatrical experience. The creators chose Jonathan Hochwald as the live show's producer, Gip Hoppe as its director, and Dave Gallo as its set designer. Neither Hoppe nor Gallo had any previous experience in children's theater. Nick Balaban and Michael Rubin, who wrote the music for <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>show,</b> composed the live show's soundtrack. The producers were concerned with children's response to the host, who was played by Tom Mizer (a different actor than the host of <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>show),</b> but his young audience enthusiastically accepted and embraced him. Actors were encouraged to improvise and respond to the audience, which resulted in changes throughout the show's run. The show's script included humor that both children and their parents could enjoy.|$|E

5|$|The Tribune {{believed}} the situation would be settled quickly and was {{confident enough to}} begin developing a Dick Tracy live action television series with Lorenzo di Bonaventura, Robert Newmyer and Outlaw Productions. <b>The</b> <b>TV</b> <b>show</b> {{was to have a}} contemporary setting, comparable to Smallville, and Di Bonaventura commented that if <b>the</b> <b>TV</b> <b>show</b> was successful, a feature film would likely follow. However, an August 2005 ruling by federal judge Dean D. Pregerson cleared the way for Beatty to sue the Tribune. The April 2006 hearing ended without a ruling, but in July 2006, a Los Angeles judge ruled that the case can go to trial; Tribune's request to end the suit in their favor was rejected. The legal battle between Beatty and the Tribune continued to ensue.|$|E
