5|$|Gastrointestinal upset {{can cause}} severe discomfort; {{it is most}} common when {{metformin}} is first administered, or when the dose is increased. <b>The</b> <b>discomfort</b> can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7grams per day) and increasing the dose gradually but even with low doses 5% of people {{may be unable to}} tolerate metformin. Use of slow- or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability.|$|E
5|$|He was {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} greatest natural history explorers of the 19th century. Despite this, his fame faded quickly after his death. For a long time, he was treated as a relatively obscure figure in the history of science. A number of reasons have been suggested for this lack of attention, including his modesty, his willingness to champion unpopular causes without regard for his own reputation, and <b>the</b> <b>discomfort</b> of much of the scientific community with some of his unconventional ideas.|$|E
5|$|In his films, {{the common}} man exaggerations continued. Much {{of his time in}} the films was spent {{spoofing}} himself, whether it was the affected nervousness of the treasurer in The Treasurer's Report or <b>the</b> <b>discomfort</b> in explaining The Sex Life of the Polyp to a women's club. The longer, plot-driven shorts, such as Lesson Number One, Furnace Trouble, and Stewed, Fried and Boiled, likewise show a Benchley character overmatched by seemingly mundane tasks. Even the more stereotypical characters held these qualities, such as the incapable sportscaster Benchley played in The Sport Parade.|$|E

5|$|Molecular {{methods have}} {{confirmed}} the high prevalence of P. falciparum malaria in ancient Egypt. The Ancient Greek historian Herodotus {{wrote that the}} builders of the Egyptian pyramids (circa 2700–1700 BCE) were given large amounts of garlic, probably to protect them against malaria. The Pharaoh Sneferu, {{the founder of the}} Fourth dynasty of Egypt, who reigned from around 2613–2589 BCE, used bed-nets as protection against mosquitoes. Cleopatra VII, the last Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, similarly slept under a mosquito net. However, whether the mosquito nets were used for the purpose of malaria prevention, or for more mundane purpose of avoiding <b>the</b> <b>discomfort</b> of mosquito bites, is unknown. The presence of malaria in Egypt from circa 800 BCE onwards has been confirmed using DNA-based methods.|$|E
5|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI), {{commonly known}} as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow decreases or stops to {{a part of the}} heart, causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it occurs in the center or left side of the chest and lasts {{for more than a few}} minutes. <b>The</b> <b>discomfort</b> may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms. Women more often have atypical symptoms than men. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, cardiogenic shock, or cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|Not all Heathens {{practice}} seiðr; {{given its}} associations {{with both the}} ambiguity of sexuality and gender and the gods Odin and Loki in their unreliable trickster forms, many on the Heathen movement's right wing disapprove of it. Although there are heterosexual male practitioners, seiðr is largely associated with women and gay men. One member of the Troth, Edred Thorsson, developed forms of seiðr which involved sex magic utilizing sado-masochistic techniques, something which generated controversy in the community. Part of <b>the</b> <b>discomfort</b> that some Heathens feel toward seiðr surrounds {{the lack of any}} criteria by which the community can determine whether the seiðr-worker has genuinely received divine communication, and the fear that it will be used by some practitioners merely to bolster their own prestige.|$|E

5|$|The {{choice of}} date proved unfortunate for several reasons. It clashed {{with a public}} holiday, and many people had left {{the city for the}} country. It was an {{intensely}} hot day, which further reduced the number of people prepared to suffer <b>the</b> <b>discomfort</b> of a stuffy theatre. Worse, the threat of an imminent war between Prussia and Austria caused unrest and anxiety in Prague, which dampened public enthusiasm for light romantic comedy. Thus on its opening night the opera, in its two-act version with spoken dialogue, was poorly attended and indifferently received. Receipts failed to cover costs, and the theatre director was forced to pay Smetana's fee from his own pocket.|$|E
5|$|While foreign {{shareholders}} supported Woodford's proxy {{fight to}} replace the Olympus board, he failed to gain support from Japanese institutions; Sumitomo Mitsui bank, identified as the company's main creditor, warned Woodford that he would fail. Woodford was disappointed by their silence, but acknowledged that even had he won a shareholder vote to become chief executive, the antipathy towards him of major shareholders and creditors, and <b>the</b> <b>discomfort</b> within the company about his decision to publicly disclose the accounting irregularities, would have made running the company difficult. On 6 January 2012, on failing to secure support from Japanese institutional shareholders, Woodford said that the 12-week public scandal had taken an enormous emotional toll on him and his family, and {{announced that he would}} abandon his proxy fight {{to take control of the}} Olympus board. Instead, his lawyers had initiated legal proceedings in London seeking unspecified damages for dismissal from his four-year contract.|$|E
5|$|With Kesler {{back in the}} lineup, the Canucks were inconstant {{posting a}} 2–3–2 record. Kesler {{registered}} five points in the seven games, but was playing with <b>the</b> <b>discomfort</b> steaming from a blocked shot {{in his first game}} back against Dallas. He was given a CT scan for his peace of mind. The results of the scan revealed a fracture in his foot. Though no time table for his return was given, the expectation was that he would be out of the line-up for four-to-six weeks. Late in the month, Kevin Bieksa suffered a groin injury in a game versus the Nashville Predators. He missed the next two games as Vancouver finished the month with back-to-back losses. After being reunited with Burrows, the Sedin twins registered a combined 18 points in the final six games of February, while Kassian tallied only three assists in the 11 games after his demotion.|$|E

5|$|The {{draw for}} {{the third round of}} the FA Cup saw Manchester United take on cup holders Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in a repeat of the 1994 final. The outcome was the same: United {{dominated}} from the outset and Chelsea found themselves 3–0 down {{before the end of the}} first half. Cole and Sheringham added to the rout, before Graeme Le Saux and Gianluca Vialli added three between them for Chelsea to keep the score a competitive one. Many journalists and fans regarded the win as United's best of the season. Another five goals were dished out against Division Two outfit Walsall, and in the fifth round they were placed alongside Premiership strugglers, Barnsley, whom they had ripped apart in October. An error by Schmeichel allowed Barnsley to take the lead but Sheringham equalised four minutes later. A replay was needed, much to <b>the</b> <b>discomfort</b> of Ferguson, and in a thrilling cup tie, United were knocked out, putting the ultimate treble dream – comprising the UEFA Champions League, the Premier League and the FA Cup – on hold for another season.|$|E

25|$|The adverse {{side effects}} of {{injected}} testosterone esters are generally associated with high peak levels {{in the first few}} days after an injection. Some side effects may be ameliorated by using a shorter dosing interval (weekly or every ten days instead of twice monthly with testosterone enanthate or testosterone cypionate). 100mg weekly gives a much lower peak level of testosterone than does 200mg every two weeks, while still maintaining the same total dose of androgen. This benefit must be weighed against <b>the</b> <b>discomfort</b> and inconvenience of doubling the number of injections.|$|E

Rossello's bid, including a number of NPP voters who also supported Rossello.|$|E
