5|$|From this interchange, {{the road}} {{continues}} northeast through industrial areas to an interchange with US 1/9 <b>Truck</b> <b>that</b> {{provides access to}} the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95). US 1/9 continue onto the Pulaski Skyway, which carries the route over the Passaic River into Hudson County, crossing over Kearny and the Hackensack River before coming into Jersey City. Trucks are banned from the Pulaski Skyway and must use US 1/9 Truck to bypass it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{terrorist}} attacks in Paris on the Friday evening of the race weekend, Formula One decided to honour the victims with all drivers wearing black armbands during the parade lap on race day as well as the French tricolore being displayed on the <b>truck</b> <b>that</b> took the drivers around the track. French driver Romain Grosjean had already worn an armband with the flag of his country during Saturday's sessions. However, a long planned minute of silence for the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims was upheld and plans to dedicate the salute to the Paris attacks discarded.|$|E
5|$|Carol buys a car, and the McCoys {{drive to}} an {{electronics}} store. As Doc buys a portable radio, he switches {{off the television}} set near the proprietor's desk broadcasting {{the news of the}} earlier incidents they were involved in. Suddenly, all the television sets in the store show Doc's picture, prompting him to leave immediately. The proprietor gets a glimpse of the picture, and calls the police. Doc steals a shotgun, followed by several shoot-outs and police chases. The couple escape by hiding in a large trash bin, only to end up {{in the back of a}} garbage <b>truck</b> <b>that</b> dumps its load at the local landfill. Filthy and frustrated, they argue about whether to stay together or split up. They decide to see things through.|$|E

5|$|Responsibility for the {{expedition}} {{was given to}} Sivert Klevan, an engineer with a good instinct for public relations. The ice was to be procured from the glacier Svartisen, and a glaciologist was brought along to give advice. It {{soon became clear that}} the entire three-ton block could not be brought out in one go. Instead, 200kg blocks were cut out with a chainsaw, carried away on a sled, and flown by helicopter down to the town centre. There they were melted together to make a block of ice weighing 3,050kg. The block was placed in a specially constructed iron container, which was insulated with wood and glass wool. The container was placed on top of a <b>truck</b> <b>that</b> would carry {{it all the way to}} the Equator, accompanied by a van carrying equipment and a sedan with a film crew.|$|E
5|$|US 1 and US 9 become {{concurrent}} upon merging in Woodbridge Township {{and continue}} through developed areas, interchanging with Route 35. Soon after this interchange, jughandles and other traffic light-controlled intersections resume. Upon entering Union County, US 1/9 pass through Rahway and Linden, interchanging with I-278 in Linden. The road continues into urban Elizabeth, crossing Route 439 before {{turning into a}} freeway prior to meeting Route 81 near Newark Liberty International Airport. US 1/9 continue along {{the west end of}} the airport into Newark, Essex County, reaching the Newark Airport Interchange with I-78, US 22, and Route 21. From this interchange, the road continues northeast through industrial areas to an interchange with US 1/9 <b>Truck</b> <b>that</b> provides access to the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95).|$|E
5|$|Claude {{then begins}} {{working for the}} city's Yakuza and its leader Asuka Kasen (Lianna Pai), Maria's close friend, who has Claude assassinate Salvatore and get his revenge. This cuts off all of Claude's ties with the Leone family, who are now against him. Claude's work leads him to allying himself with other {{criminal}} sources, such as corrupt police detective Ray Machowski (Robert Loggia), {{an enemy of the}} Cartel. Claude later saves him from Internal Affairs and the CIA by helping him flee to Vice City. Claude also meets charismatic media mogul Donald Love (Kyle MacLachlan), who maintains a huge media front. In an effort to start a war between the Yakuza and Cartel, Claude and Love organise the death of Asuka's brother Kenji Kasen (Les Mau) and blame the Cartel. Later, Love asks Claude to rescue a man who was kidnapped by the Cartel in the prison <b>truck</b> <b>that</b> Claude was in. While on an errand, Claude finally confronts Catalina, who narrowly escapes. Asuka abducts Catalina's partner Miguel (Al Espinosa), believing him to have knowledge of her brother's death.|$|E

5000|$|In general an {{axle width}} should be chosen that {{is close to}} the width of the deck it will be used with. For example, a 7.75" [...] wide deck will usually be fitted with <b>trucks</b> <b>that</b> have axles between 7.5" [...] wide and 8.0" [...] wide. (Standard truck axle nut size is 5/16"-24tpi UNF, and the thinner [...] "jam" [...] style with an {{optional}} nylon lock.) <b>Trucks</b> <b>that</b> are too wide can make doing tricks difficult and can cause the wheels {{to get in the way}} when the skateboard is being ridden. <b>Trucks</b> <b>that</b> are too small can be hard to maintain stability and can cause wheel bite to occur when turning.|$|R

25|$|Recent {{developments}} in autonomous automobiles {{have made the}} innovation of self-driving trucks possible, though the they {{are still in the}} testing phase. The UK government has passed legislation to begin testing of self-driving truck platoons in 2018. Self-driving truck platoons are a fleet of self-driving trucks following the lead of one non-self-driving truck, so the truck platoons aren't entirely autonomous yet. Meanwhile, the Daimler, a German automobile corporation, is testing the Freightliner Inspiration which is a semi-autonomous <b>truck</b> <b>that</b> will only be used on the highway.|$|E
25|$|T.J. Tilcox: A 21-year-old ice road rookie, Tilcox is {{vocal about}} how he hates the cold and ice, and {{explains}} that he is driving on the ice road for the experience, not the money. Tilcox has been trucking since age 16 and decided to try ice road trucking after seeing an advertisement in the newspaper. Early on he struggles with an older <b>truck</b> <b>that</b> lacks heat, but another driver grants Tilcox {{the use of his}} brand new Volvo truck leased to Trinity Transport. On his first run in the new truck, Tilcox gets in an accident before ever hitting the ice road, due to the brake service line's disconnecting from his trailer. Tilcox is ultimately cleared of responsibility and, after a delay, allowed back on the road.|$|E

25|$|Preliminary {{underwater}} {{inspections of}} the Norman Atlantic {{revealed that the}} water intake pipes of the fire sprinkler system were clogged with mussels; additional inspections are necessary to determine if this blockage contributed to the fire's spreading. Although the voyage data recorder (black box) has been recovered, still by mid-March no data have been extracted, apparently because {{the heat of the}} fire caused the plastic to melt onto the hard disk. Recordings of the Voyage data recorder published on 7 October 2015, say that the fire sprinkler system wasn't working correctly and instead of spraying water there was smoke coming from the system. The investigations also state that there was a <b>truck</b> <b>that</b> had the engine working. Smoke was coming from the truck prior to the fire.|$|E
25|$|The Grand Dukes {{were loaded}} into a <b>truck</b> <b>that</b> already held four common criminals and six Red Guardsmen. At 1:20 am on 28 January, {{they left the}} prison. They drove towards the river by the Field of Mars, where the truck stalled. While the driver was trying to restart it, one of the convicts tried to run and {{was shot in the}} back as he fled. The truck {{eventually}} began running again, and they drove to the Peter and Paul Fortress. The prisoners were roughly pushed from the truck into the Trubetskoy bastion. They were told to remove their shirts and coats, {{despite the fact that it}} was almost 20 degrees below zero. By then they had no doubt what was about to occur and the Grand Dukes embraced each other for the last time.|$|E
25|$|Mock bombardments of {{imaginary}} shore {{positions were}} carried out by Prince David in Saanich Inlet, and equally imaginary shore batteries fired back, while movie raiders rowed the ship's boats ashore {{as hard as they}} could. A ship-handling problem peculiar to this operation was that in every scene where Prince David was to appear herself, she could present only her starboard side to the camera. It was calculated that cinema-goers would not likely accept the huge sound <b>truck</b> <b>that</b> had been hoisted aboard, and reposed on the weather deck port side, as a regular item in Combined Operations weaponry. The ship's company co-operated heartily, and kept up a high standard of discipline and war-readiness despite the distractions of this fling with film fame, and the glitter of hob-nobbing with the film famous.|$|E

25|$|Damages, such as cracks on solar modules, {{have been}} seen on several occasions, mostly on the Sun installation, where 12 solar modules have been damaged, {{as well as on}} Jupiter and Saturn installations. It was thought at first that the cause of the cracks was hitting modules several times with an {{extremely}} heavy metal object because they can take a capacity of 400 kg, and are extremely difficult to break. It was later discovered by chance from the nearby ferry security camera footage that the cracks were caused by 3500 kg pickup <b>truck</b> <b>that</b> ran over modules. After this damage City introduced 24 hours supervisor and surveillance cameras that monitor the Monument. In June 2009, a unidentified hard object smashed 4 modules, and on night of August 8, 2 more. Nevertheless, all broken modules have been replaced with new ones.|$|E
25|$|Sweet soon {{learns that}} Big Smoke is {{holed up in}} a {{fortified}} crack den in the city, and he and CJ go there to confront him. CJ enters the building alone, fighting his way to the top floor and confronting Smoke. CJ attempts to reason with Big Smoke, but the latter engages CJ in a gunfight. CJ defeats him and Big Smoke confesses that he betrayed the GSF in order to gain more power and money, and dies shortly after from his injuries. Just then, Tenpenny appears, holds CJ at gunpoint and steals Big Smoke's money, intending to use it to leave the city. Tenpenny escapes and CJ and Sweet pursue him. During the pursuit, Tenpenny loses control of a fire <b>truck</b> <b>that</b> he was using as a getaway vehicle, driving off the bridge over the Grove Street cul-de-sac and crashing at the entrance to it. CJ and his friends watch as a fatally wounded Tenpenny crawls from the wreckage and dies.|$|E
25|$|Just 20 minutes later, {{however, the}} drone spotted {{hundreds}} of more militants approaching the base. This renewed attack caught the defenders largely by surprise, {{and they were}} not able to stop an explosive-laden <b>truck</b> <b>that</b> was driven by an Al-Shabaab suicide bomber into the base. Though the car bomb was finally destroyed by a Kenyan soldier who fired an 84mm anti-tank gun at it, the vehicle had already breached the base's outer perimeter by this point, allowing the militants to storm it. As result, a brutal and confusing firefight began. Captain Silas Ekidor, the Kenyan second-in-command, attempted to reorganise the defences and rallied several soldiers to his position but was killed by a second car bomb. The Artillery Battery commander, Major Mwangi, was also killed {{at some point during the}} fighting. Meanwhile, two of the four Kenyan platoons present had begun to retreat under the orders of their commanders, leaving the platoons of Ekidor and Mwangi alone to face the attackers.|$|E
