500|$|Together {{with her}} sister , Hesperus sank the [...] on 7 December 1941 in the Atlantic west of Gibraltar. On 15 January 1942, whilst {{defending}} Convoy HG 78, the ship's radar detected [...] {{on the surface and}} the captain, Lieutenant Commander A. A. Tait, ordered Hesperus to ram. Although a glancing hit, the collision was so violent that it flung the U-boat's captain and first lieutenant from the submarine's conning tower into the motorboat stowed on the destroyer's deck. By dropping depth charges at their shallowest setting and hitting the submarine multiple times with 4.7-inch shells, the submarine's crew was persuaded to abandon ship. Hesperus rescued 40 of the submarine's crew, but was unable to board the submarine before it sank. The impact flooded part of the forward hull, buckled her starboard hull plating and bent <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> starboard propeller. She received temporary repairs at Gibraltar and then was given permanent repairs in Falmouth between 9 February and April.|$|E
