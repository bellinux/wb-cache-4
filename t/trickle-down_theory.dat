He includes other demographics such as gender, age and ethnicity. McCracken also acknowledges that the trickle down effect does not necessitate the appropriation of style but that the group can selectively borrow aspects of fashion, maintaining some of its own qualities. He also accounts for the influence of distribution, investors and location in relation to the trickle-down effect.|$|E

This study, after all, lends more credence to the study of Kanayo, George and Adenuga (2004) which reports that there is no co-integration between trade openness and economic growth on the one hand, and with poverty reduction, on the other hand, both at 1 percent and 5 percent significance levels. But, capital expenditure is the only variable that both impacts on growth and also trickles down to the ‘common man ’ and thus reduces the poverty level of the Nigerian economy...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to understand the role of luxury brands in the diffusion of eco-innovations through the fashion industry, and whether the <b>trickle-down</b> <b>theory</b> applies. Methodology: Structured qualitative interviews were carried out with 13 individuals working in luxury, mass and value market fashion brands to understand the perceptions of how innovation and eco-innovation were generated and diffused through the fashion industry. Rogers’ theory of innovation diffusion was used to analyse and explore interview responses. Findings: The results of the research suggest the interviewees perceived the trickle-down effect as less relevant for eco-innovations than for aesthetic innovations (newness in style, design or colour). It was found that suppliers, competitors and senior management play a more important role in diffusion of eco-innovation. A five point model for successful eco-innovation diffusion within a fashion business was established from the research. Limitations: As the first stage of a larger project, this research focused on one interviewee from the product design and development team within each brand. Further research will be carried out to explore the perceptions of eco-innovations for other functions within the brands. Implications: Fashion brands wishing to adopt eco-innovations can use the five point model to help them establish the right conditions for successful adoption within their business. Originality/value: This research extends existing work on the adoption of sustainability within the fashion industry by exploring the adoption routes for eco-innovation and using Rogers’ framework to create a five point model for innovation...|$|E
40|$|How do {{the elite}} {{perceive}} poverty and social exclusion? This paper {{is a result}} of an elite opinion study conducted in Karnataka State in the south of India. The poverty debate is an important aspect of Indian society. Poverty and exclusion in India have drawn increasing policy attention since 1960. Over the last six decades, various governments have pursued the long-term goal of promoting an inclusive programme for the poor section of the society. Social exclusion is a process by which people cannot completely participate in the development process due the various social (caste and class), optical, economic, and other reasons. Even though India is experiencing impressive inclusive growth, poverty and social exclusion still exist there. In India urban poverty is clearly visible. Rural poverty is not so visible because of various hidden dimensions in the rural society. According to this study elite felt high quality education system may {{play a vital role in}} eradicating poverty in the country and help to increase the quality of human resources. In addition, the elite opined that anti-poverty measures are plagued by corruption in India and require good governance. Corruption is one of the main hurdles to rapid inclusive growth and the reason for the failure of the <b>trickle-down</b> <b>theory</b> in India. It is found that the elite’s perception of social exclusion in India is due to its unique social structure and social dynamics. This study was conducted among selected elite of variou...|$|E
40|$|Fashion's {{universal}} nature {{does not}} preclude strong variations in its significance from society to society. As a stratification variable, fashion's importance increases in step with economic growth. Simmel sees the ‘need for distinction’ and the ‘need for union’ as preconditions for fashion, with certain societies lacking the necessary motivation. Variations in fashion's importance have also been tied to women's standing in society; according to Veblen, their role was to be vicarious consumers and thus vehicles of fashion. There are numerous theories on what drives fashion's continuous changes. The theory of social differentiation argues that fashion is based on class, the upper classes abandoning a fashion once it has trickled down to the lower classes. The theory of fashion's internal dynamic contends that changes are powered by an Eigendynamik in fashion; Nedelmann develops {{the idea of the}} inherently contradictory nature of fashion. The theory that fashion is a manifestation of the expression for other social change is a variant of spirit of the age theory. Different system theories analyze the influence of the different elements of the fashion system. <b>Trickle-down</b> <b>theory</b> has been criticized by system theorists for failing {{to take into account the}} complex organizational and marketing structures that mediate fashion. Arguing for a violation of convention theory, Campbell has identified peripheral groups such as bohemians and artists—not the upper class of social differentiation theory—as setting fashion in motion by defying convention. Fashion offers a means of psychological expression, but also a social expression of protest. A number of researchers see distinct cycles in fashion. However, the transient symbols of what is right at a given moment can never be nailed down in advance, making unpredictability the decisive characteristic of fashion...|$|E
40|$|Regional {{economic}} growth based on private sector job creation is often proposed {{as a policy}} for reducing the incidence of regional unemployment, poverty and dependency. One factor that could limit the impact of {{economic growth}} on the employment and poverty status of an area's indigenous population is the area's public assistance system. This study evaluates the impact of recent changes in federal welfare legislation (HR 3982) on the work incentives and the poverty and dependency status of Delaware female household heads receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) assistance. Specifically, the study estimates the implicit marginal tax rates that such household heads would face by accepting employment in private sector jobs {{to which they are}} potential entrants under the pre and post HR 3982 conditions. In addition, the study examines the effect of the HR 3982 changes on the poverty and dependency status of such households. Regional economic growth based on private sector job creation has long been advocated as a policy for reducing the incidence of regional unemployment, poverty, and dependency (Smith). Such policy proposals are based on the <b>trickle-down</b> <b>theory.</b> This theory holds that economic growth results in an increase in the demand for skilled labor, which in turn results in an upgrading of the positions of the semiskilled, unskilled, and unemployed. 1 The result is economic growth and a reduction in the incidence of unemployment, poverty, and dependency in the region. One factor that could limit the impact of regional economic growth on the employment and poverty status of an area's indigenous population is the area's public assistance sys-tem. To the extent that the indigenous poor (the target population) are actual or potential public assistance recipients, the public assis-tance system could be expected to increas...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1994 The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare Far Eastern {{influences}} on Western women's dress as represented in both a high fashion and mass fashion magazine between 1910 and 1925. Vogue was selected as the high fashion magazine and Ladies Home Journal as the mass fashion magazine. The questions that were addressed were: was there a difference in the influence of the Far East on high fashion styles and mass fashion styles, was there a time lapse between the appearance of fashion styles influenced by the Far East within Vogue and Ladies Home Journal, and was the <b>trickle-down</b> <b>theory</b> applicable when examining Far Eastern influence on high fashion styles and mass fashion styles. The data were collected by conducting a content analysis of both the written and visual material within Vogue and Ladies Home Journal. For each magazine the January, April, July, and October issues were examined, totaling a 128 issues between the years 1910 and 1925. The written examples found within both magazines were placed into three categories; Chinese, Japanese, and Far Eastern/Oriental. Visual examples found were placed into three categories also; Chinese, Japanese, and Combination. An example of Far Eastern influence on written or visual material was based on predetermined guidelines. It was hypothesized that there would be a difference in the frequency of Far Eastern influence seen in high fashion styles as represented in Vogue and mass fashion styles as represented in Ladies Home Journal between 1910 and 1925. The sign test was used to compare the two samples Vogue and Ladies Home Journal and test this hypothesis. It was determined that there was not a significant difference found in either the written or visual material therefore this hypothesis was rejected. The second hypothesis was that there would be a difference in the period of introduction of fashion styles influenced by the Far East between Vogue and Ladies Home Journal. There was no apparent difference between the period of introduction of fashion styles influenced by the Far East in Vogue and Ladies Home Journal between 1910 and 1925 when examining total frequencies of both written and visual material. Some differences were evident when examining categorical breakdowns which led to neither the acceptance or rejection of the hypothesis due to the differing results...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{represents a}} new 2 ̆ 7 departure {{in the study}} of dress in colonial Western Australia, focusing on the rationale behind individual and collective clothing practices in the new society. As a study of significant social and cultural practices, rather than an account of fashion, this research contributes to the understanding of previously disregarded elements in colonial Western Australian ethno-economic and social histories. The study investigates the internal and external influences which impacted upon colonial inhabitants 2 ̆ 7 ways of dressing, their societal attitudes and social demeanour. The research compares the influences on attire and finery in colonial Western Australian society with the British/European context. This thesis examines the influences caused by world-wide dominant events, ideas and social groups, and their effect on societal and cultural attitudes in the colony. The thesis examines clothing as a symbolic indicator of status which influenced the class distinction in colonial Western Australian society. Also the function of dress as it relates to class consciousness and identification. The research focuses on the ambiguities associated with colonial clothing {{and the way in which}} social class and status were negotiated through wearing apparel in the colony. This thesis examines colonial Western Australian fashion and attire in the context of social stratification, social conditions, power relations and cultural formation, in order to comprehend sartorial consumerism and social practise in the colony. Fashion 2 ̆ 7 s ultimate function of signifying power and prestige, which linked with financial capability, and its impact on society and societal practise, is significant. The research examines the affiliation between colonial clothing and the economic growth of Western Australia in the context of the development of the colonial clothing economy and the influence of affluent colonists and traders who controlled the clothing behaviour in the colony. One of the primary purposes of this study is to examine the meanings encoded in colonial dress and adornment. The function of clothing and its adornment was often used for more than its utilitarian purpose. For example, the analysis of gender in clothing reflects the sociological differences and the power relations between sexes. In that context, the dissertation discusses colonial attire as an aesthetic experience, as well as a social and cultural expression of the period by examining Veblen’s Leisure Theory and Simmel’s <b>Trickle-down</b> <b>Theory.</b> Colonial characteristics such as different societal and climatic conditions as well as the way of life brought about a society dissimilar to that in Britain but symbolic to its colonialism. This research investigates the unique social and cultural qualities which applied in the colony and which resulted in a tendency towards distinctive dress codes in early Western Australia. This study explores the consumption governance, potency and patronage of attire in colonial Western Australia within the context of social, socio-economic and fashion philosophies...|$|E
