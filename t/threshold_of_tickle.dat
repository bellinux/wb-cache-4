5000|$|Knismesis and gargalesis are the {{scientific}} terms, coined in 1897 by psychologists G. Stanley Hall and Arthur Allin, {{used to describe}} the two types <b>of</b> <b>tickling.</b> Knismesis refers to the light, feather-like type <b>of</b> <b>tickling.</b> This type <b>of</b> <b>tickling</b> generally does not induce laughter and is often accompanied by an itching sensation. Gargalesis refers to harder, laughter-inducing tickling, and involves the repeated application of high pressure to sensitive areas. This [...] "heavy tickle" [...] is often associated with play and laughter.|$|R

This type <b>of</b> <b>tickle</b> torture would only start as tickling, eventually becoming extremely painful.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper was to clarify how the {{distinction}} of self- (sense of agency, SOA) and other-produced behavior can be synthesized and recognized in multisensory integration as our cognitive processes. To address this issue, we used tickling paradigm {{that it is hard}} for us to tickle ourselves. Previous studies show that tickle sensation by their own motion increases if more delay is given between self-motion <b>of</b> <b>tickling</b> and tactile stimulation (Blakemore et al. 1998, 1999). We introduced visual feedbacks to the tickling experiments. In our hypothesis, integration of vision, proprioception, and motor commands forms the SOA and disintegration causes the breakdown the SOA, which causes the feeling <b>of</b> others, producing <b>tickling</b> sensation even by tickling oneself. We used video-see-through HMD to suddenly delay the real-time images <b>of</b> their hand <b>tickling</b> motions. The tickle sensation was measured by subjective response in the following conditions; 1) tickling oneself without any visual modulation, 2) tickled by others, 3) tickling oneself with visual feedback manipulation. The statistical analysis of ranked evaluation <b>of</b> <b>tickle</b> sensations showed that the delay of visual feedback causes the increase <b>of</b> <b>tickle</b> sensation. The SOA was discussed with Blakemore's and our results...|$|R

5000|$|Tickle torture {{can be an}} {{extended}} act <b>of</b> <b>tickling</b> where the recipient <b>of</b> the <b>tickling</b> would {{view it as a}} long time or <b>tickling</b> <b>of</b> an intense nature. This can be due to the length of time they are <b>tickled,</b> the intensity <b>of</b> the <b>tickling</b> or the areas that are being tickled. This can simply be a 30-second tickle applied to the victim's bare feet, which can seem like a much longer time if the victim's feet are very ticklish. While the palm of the hand is far more sensitive to touch, other commonly ticklish areas include the armpits, sides of the torso, neck, knee, midriff, navel, and the ribs. Many people consider the soles of their feet the most ticklish, due to the many nerve endings located there: this explains why tickling one's feet against their will is the most common example of [...] "tickle torture".|$|R

50|$|There are a {{small number}} of {{documented}} instances <b>of</b> <b>tickle</b> torture in the New York Times.

5000|$|In 1897, psychologists G. Stanley Hall and Arthur Allin {{described}} a [...] "tickle" [...] as {{two different types}} of phenomena. One type is caused by very light movement across the skin. This type <b>of</b> <b>tickle,</b> called a knismesis, generally does not produce laughter and is sometimes accompanied by an itching sensation.|$|R
5000|$|The gargalesis type <b>of</b> <b>tickle</b> {{works on}} humans and primates, and {{possibly}} on other species. For example, ultrasonic vocalizations described as [...] "chirping", which play into social behavior and even have therapeutic effects, {{are reported in}} rats in response to human tickling. However, adult female rats may find the tickling sensation adverse. [...] Because the nerves involved in transmitting [...] "light" [...] touch and itch differ from those nerves that transmit [...] "heavy" [...] touch, pressure and vibration, {{it is possible that}} the difference in sensations produced by the two types <b>of</b> <b>tickle</b> is due to the relative proportion of itch sensation versus touch sensation. While it is possible to trigger a knismesis response in oneself, it is usually impossible to produce gargalesthesia, the gargalesis tickle response, in oneself. Hypergargalesthesia is the condition of extreme sensitivity to tickling.|$|R
5000|$|... "Tickle torture" [...] {{may also}} have other uses, {{including}} the act <b>of</b> <b>tickling</b> a person as a practical joke, or even an interrogation method. This may not be extreme tickling, but could include prolonged tickling upon a sensitive area until the victim has released the required information. In the former case, {{it could be used}} as a way of [...] "pranking" [...] a person, as the act <b>of</b> being <b>tickled</b> can produce many sounds and sensations that could be viewed as being embarrassing to the victim. In this way, the tickling can continue to the point where a certain reaction is revealed.|$|R

40|$|Rats {{initially}} fear humans {{which can}} increase stress and impact study results. Additionally, studying positive affective states in rats has proved challenging. Rat tickling is a promising habituation technique {{that can also}} be used to model and measure positive affect. However, current studies use a variety of methods to achieve differential results. Our objective was to systematically identify, summarize, and evaluate the research on tickling in rats to provide direction for future investigation. Our specific aims were to summarize current methods used in tickling experiments, outcomes from tickling, and moderating factors. We systematically evaluated all articles about tickling identified from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsychInfo. Our inclusion criteria were publication in a peer-reviewed journal and collection of original, empirical data on rats using the handling method <b>of</b> <b>tickling.</b> One researcher extracted information from each article. Bias was assessed by 2 investigators using the SYRCLE bias assessment tool. We identified 32 articles (56 experiments) published in peer-reviewed journals about rat tickling for inclusion. A wide variety of strains, sexes, and ages of rats were included. The most common method used for tickling was cycling through 15 seconds <b>of</b> <b>tickling</b> and 15 seconds of rest for 2 minutes for 3 to 5 days. Experiments with a control for tickling (N = 22) showed that tickling increases positive vocalization, approach behavior, decreases anxiety measures, improves handling, and in some cases decreases stress hormones. Tickling juvenile, individually housed rats with a trait predisposition to respond more positively to tickling, results in the most positive outcomes. Methods to reduce bias were insufficiently reported. We conclude that tickling is a promising method for improving rat welfare and investigating positive affect. However, the establishment <b>of</b> <b>tickling</b> best practices is essential as the outcomes from tickling can be moderated by several factors...|$|R
