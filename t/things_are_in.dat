25|$|The band {{soon after}} began a {{longtime}} association with Blackout Records, who released {{some of their}} songs on the label's compilation Where the Wild <b>Things</b> <b>Are,</b> <b>in</b> 1989, along with a 7 inch Live At CBGB release. The following year, the band recorded their debut full length Just Can't Hate Enough. The record was engineered by Tommy Victor of Prong. As Victor also worked at CBGB, {{he was able to}} allow the band to record live at the famous bar in the morning and afternoon hours before shows were held. The record was released in Germany on Starving Missile Records, and later released stateside under the Blackout name. Just Can't Hate Enough quickly became one of the records that defined the new, heavier sound of hardcore that was emerging at the time, played by bands such as Biohazard and Killing Time, among others. The guitar tone and riffs, in particular, display a large heavy metal influence, especially from Swiss speed metallers Celtic Frost, who were allegedly one of Alan Blake's favorite bands. The band also became known for Bearer's no-nonsense stage personality, with some finding him offensive, and others enjoying his often blunt and obscenity filled humor.|$|E

Its volunteers often style themselves with eyelash extensions, stiletto heels, skinny jeans, skin-tight T-shirts, and backcombed hair to convey the message that such <b>things</b> <b>are,</b> <b>in</b> their view, not sinful. Founder Heather Veitch said, [...] "Our desire is for people to see that Christianity is anything but boring and restrictive. In Christ, we are free to experience adventure, pleasure, forgiveness, hope and peace." ...|$|E

Annenberg Ames felt unable to wear the diamond in her native New York City, and decided to sell the stone. She later said that [...] "I found myself positively cringing and keeping my gloves on for fear it would be seen.... It sat in a bank vault for years. It seemed foolish to keep it if one could not use it. As <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> New York one could not possibly wear it publicly".|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Troilus and Cressida", by a {{comparison}} with Chaucer's method of depicting character, he explains in detail how Shakespeare's idea of [...] "character" [...] is not fixed, and Shakespeare shows the characters {{not only by}} their own behaviour but as they view and react to one another. Likewise, Shakespeare's attention was not merely to habitual outward behaviour, but to the most transitory, fleeting inward impressions. [...] "Shakespear exhibited [...] not only what <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> themselves, but whatever they might seem to be, their different reflections, their endless combinations." ...|$|E
500|$|Learning to be yourself, to be {{authentic}} and to act with integrity, rather than conforming to any external moral system, is arguably the fundamental motif of Williams's work, according to Sophie Grace Chappell. [...] "If there's one theme in all my work it's about authenticity and self-expression," [...] Williams said in 2002. [...] "It's the idea that some <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> some real sense really you, or express what you and others aren't... The whole thing has been about spelling out the notion of inner necessity." [...] He moved moral philosophy away from the Kantian question, [...] "What is my duty?", {{and back to the}} issue that mattered to the Greeks: [...] "How should we live?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Buddhism {{teaches that}} all <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> a {{constant}} state of flux: all is changing, and no [...] state exists by itself. This applies to human beings as much as to anything else in the cosmos. Thus, a human being has no permanent self. According to this doctrine of anatta (Pāli; Sanskrit: anātman) – [...] "no-self" [...] or [...] "no soul" [...] – the words [...] "I" [...] or [...] "me" [...] do not refer to any fixed thing. They are simply convenient terms that allow us to refer to an ever-changing entity.|$|E

2500|$|Bad as <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> Indonesia, one {{positive}} fact is known. Indonesia has a fabulous potential wealth in {{natural resources and}} the New Order [...] wants it exploited. So they are returning the private properties expropriated by Sukarno's regime. Goodyear's Sumatran rubber empire is an example. It was seized [...] in retaliation for U.S. aggression in Vietnam in 1965. The rubber workers union was Communist-run, so after the coup {{many of them were}} killed or imprisoned. Some of the survivors, you see them here, still work the rubber -- but this time as prisoners, and at gunpoint.|$|E
2500|$|Spectator wrote: [...] "The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, {{like its}} {{predecessor}} , suggests {{the idea of}} considerable abilities ill applied. There is power, effect, and even nature, though of an extreme kind, in its pages; but there seems in the writer a morbid love for the coarse, {{not to say the}} brutal; so that his level subjects are not very attractive, and the more forcible are displeasing or repulsive, from their gross, physical, or profligate substratum. He might reply, that such <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> life... Mere existence, however, as we have often had occasion to remark, is not a sufficient reason for a choice of subject: its general or typical character is a point to consider, and its power of pleasing must be regarded, as well as its mere capabilities of force or effect. It is not only the subject of this novel, however, that is objectionable, but the manner of treating it. There is a coarseness of tone throughout the writing of all these Bells , that puts an offensive subject in its worst point of view, and which generally contrives to dash indifferent things".|$|E
2500|$|During a picnic, Max and Karen come close, {{sharing a}} secret touch and holding hands. Afterward, Karen resigns {{herself to her}} {{upcoming}} marriage, but before too long, the Michaelis family receives news of Aunt Violet's death, and once again <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> a state of disorder. During this chaotic time Max calls and asks to see Karen. They meet clandestinely in Boulogne and spend the day together. Max reveals that Mme Fisher believes her daughter {{is not good enough}} for him, but according to Max, Naomi is an acceptable match, simply because she is [...] "like the furniture or the dark", comfortable and reassuring. Ultimately, however, she evokes no passion in him. Likewise, Karen confides that she does not wish to marry Ray. They part, but meet again on Folkestone pier the following Saturday, spending the remainder of the day and evening in a hotel room. Karen awakens {{in the middle of the}} night and while examining her and Max's shared circumstances, she develops a type of unconscious awareness of Leopold, despite having no clear evidence he will eventually exist, suggested by the author in second person: [...] "All the same, the idea of you, Leopold, began to be present with her." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rationalism {{is often}} contrasted with empiricism. Taken very broadly these views are not {{mutually}} exclusive, since a philosopher can be both rationalist and empiricist. Taken to extremes, the empiricist view holds that all ideas come to us a posteriori, that is to say, through experience; either through the external senses or through such inner sensations as pain and gratification. The empiricist essentially believes that knowledge is based on or derived directly from experience. The rationalist believes we come to knowledge a priori– {{through the use of}} logic– and is thus independent of sensory experience. In other words, as Galen Strawson once wrote, [...] "you can see that it is true just lying on your couch. You don't have to get up off your couch and go outside and examine the way <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>in</b> the physical world. You don't have to do any science." [...] Between both philosophies, the issue at hand is the fundamental source of human knowledge and the proper techniques for verifying what we think we know. Whereas both philosophies are under the umbrella of epistemology, their argument lies in the understanding of the warrant, which is under the wider epistemic umbrella of the theory of justification.|$|E
