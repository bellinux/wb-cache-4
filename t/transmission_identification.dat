Although many studies have addressed disease symptom development and transmission of the pathogen by vectors, {{little is known about}} the bacterial mechanisms driving these processes. Recently available X. fastidiosa genomic sequences and molecular tools have provided new routes for investigation. Here, we show that a diffusible signal molecule is required for biofilm formation in the vector and for vector transmission to plants. We constructed strains of X. fastidiosa mutated in the rpfF gene and determined that they are unable to produce the signal activity. In addition, rpfF mutants are more virulent than the wild type when mechanically inoculated into plants. This signal therefore directs interaction of X. fastidiosa with both its insect vector and plant host. Interestingly, rpfF mutants can still form in planta biofilms, which differ architecturally from biofilms in insects, suggesting that biofilm architecture, rather than a passive response to the environment, is actively determined by X. fastidiosa gene expression.

Nevertheless, both registered and off-label use of third and fourth-generation cephalosporins in livestock may have influenced the emergence of plasmid-encoded AmpC β-lactamases (pAmpC) (mainly CMY- 2) and CTX-M extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) in both Gram-negative pathogens and commensals isolated from animals. This presents a public health concern due to the potential risk of transfer of β-lactam-resistant pathogens from livestock to humans through food. The recent detection of pAmpC and ESBLs in multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from dogs has also confirmed the public health importance of β-lactam resistance in companion animals, though in this case, human-to-animal transmission may be equally as relevant as animal-to-human <b>transmission.</b> <b>Identification</b> of pAmpC and ESBLs in Enterobacteriaceae isolated from wildlife and aquaculture species may be evidence of environmental selection pressure arising from both human and veterinary use of β- lactams.

40|$|ReviewSince the {{emergence}} of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, many questions remain on modes of transmission and sources of virus. In outbreak situations, especially with emerging organisms causing severe human disease, {{it is important to}} understand the full spectrum of disease, and shedding kinetics in relation to infectivity and the ability to transmit the microorganism. Laboratory response capacity during the early stages of an outbreak focuses on development of virological and immunological methods for patient diagnosis, for contact tracing, and for epidemiological studies into sources, modes of <b>transmission,</b> <b>identification</b> of risk groups, and animal reservoirs. However, optimal use of this core public health laboratory capacity requires a fundamental understanding of kinetics of viral shedding and antibody response, of assay validation and of interpretation of test outcomes. We reviewed available data from MERS-CoV case reports, and compared this with data on kinetics of shedding and immune response from published literature on other human coronaviruses (hCoVs). We identify and discuss important data gaps, and biases that limit the laboratory preparedness to this novel disease. Public health management will benefit from standardised reporting of methods used, details of test outcomes by sample type, sampling date, in relation to symptoms and risk factors, along with the currently reported demographic, clinical and epidemiological findings.

While viral determinants of human pathogenicity have been defined, {{there is a}} lack of knowledge of how dengue viruses influence mosquito <b>transmission.</b> <b>Identification</b> of viral determinants of transmission can help identify isolates with high epidemiological potential. Additionally, mechanistic understanding of transmission will lead to better understanding of how dengue viruses harness evolution to cycle between the two hosts. Here, we identified viral determinants of transmission and characterized mechanisms that enhance production of infectious saliva by inhibiting immunity specifically in salivary glands. Combining oral infection of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and reverse genetics, we identified two 3 ' UTR substitutions in epidemic isolates that increased subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) quantity, infectious particles in salivary glands and infection rate of saliva, which represents a measure of transmission. We also demonstrated that various 3 'UTR modifications similarly affect sfRNA quantity in both whole mosquitoes and human cells, suggesting a shared determinism of sfRNA quantity. Furthermore, higher relative quantity of sfRNA in salivary glands compared to midgut and carcass pointed to sfRNA function in salivary glands. We showed that the Toll innate immune response was preferentially inhibited in salivary glands by viruses with the 3 'UTR substitutions associated to high epidemiological fitness and high sfRNA quantity, pointing to a mechanism for higher saliva infection rate. By determining that sfRNA is an immune suppressor in a tissue relevant to mosquito transmission, we propose that 3 'UTR/sfRNA sequence evolution shapes dengue epidemiology not only by influencing human pathogenicity but also by increasing mosquito transmission, thereby revealing a viral determinant of epidemiological fitness that is shared between the two hosts...|$|E

40|$|Host-seeking is an {{important}} component of mosquito vectorial capacity on which the success of the other behavioural determinants depends. Blood-seeking mosquitoes are mainly guided by chemical cues released by their blood hosts. This thesis describes results of a study that determined the effect of microorganisms – host skin bacteria as well as malaria parasites – on host-seeking behaviour of female Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto and An. arabiensis in Homabay county, western Kenya. Semi-field and field experiments were conducted to determine the response of mosquitoes with different host preference to synthetic and natural odour blends from three vertebrate hosts, a human, a cow and a chicken. Screen house experiments were conducted to test whether specific skin bacteria or a mix of skin bacterial volatiles from the three vertebrate hosts mediate mosquito response. A review chapter in this thesis discusses how malaria parasites can manipulate human hosts to enhance their own transmission, by making the hosts more attractive to mosquitoes. Another experiment, using a dual-choice olfactometer, determined whether infection with malaria parasites increases human attractiveness to malaria mosquitoes, and whether the attractiveness of infected humans is Plasmodium falciparum-stage specific. Here, the same children participated in the study during infection with malaria parasites and after treatment with antimalarial drugs, artemisinin lumefantrine. Cage assays were further used to test mechanisms of attractiveness of P. falciparum-infected individuals using body odours or skin bacterial volatiles collected from the children at the two time points. Overall results show that skin bacterial volatiles play {{an important}} role in guiding mosquitoes with different host preferences to their specific host. For An. gambiae s. s., high (microscopic) densities of P. falciparum gametocytes (and not parasite-free, submicroscopic gametocytes or asexual stages of Plasmodium parasites) results into higher attractiveness of hosts, and body odours play a role in attractiveness of P. falciparum-infected humans.

This award {{acknowledged}} the enormous worldwide impact of the HIV- 1 /AIDS pandemic {{and the importance of}} research aimed at halting its spread. Since the syndrome was first recognized, 25 million people have succumbed to AIDS and over 33 million are currently infected with HIV- 1 (www. unaids. org). The most effective strategy for ending the pandemic is the creation of a prophylactic vaccine. Yet, to date, all efforts at HIV- 1 vaccine design have met with very limited success. The consistent failures of vaccine candidates stem in large part from the unprecedented diversity of HIV- 1. Among the novel theories of vaccine design put forward to address this diversity is the targeted vaccine approach. This proposal is based on the finding that mucosal transmission of HIV- 1, the most prevalent form, occurs across a selective bottleneck such that typically only a single (or a few) variants of the viral swarm present in a donor are passed to the recipient. While the mechanisms controlling the selection are largely unknown, the targeted vaccine approach postulates that once they are identified, we can utilize this understanding to design vaccines specifically targeted to the characteristics shared by the rare, mucosally transmissible HIV- 1 variants. The studies described in this work were conducted to improve our understanding of the factors influencing viral variant selection during mother-to-child-transmission of HIV- 1, a route of mucosal transmission which has globally become the leading cause of child infection. A unique panel was generated, consisting of nearly 300 HIV- 1 envelope genes cloned from infected mother-infant pairs. Extensive characterization of the genotypes, phenotypes and phylogeny of these clones was then done to identify attributes differentiating early infant from maternal variants. Low genetic diversity of HIV- 1 envelope variants was detected in early infant samples, suggesting a bottleneck and active selection of variants for transmission. Transmitted variants did not differ from non-transmitted variants in CD 4 and CCR 5 use. Infant isolates replicated poorly in macrophages; a cell subtype hypothesized to be important in the establishment of infection. The sensitivity of infant envelope variants to neutralization by a panel of monoclonal antibodies, heterologous and autologous plasmas and HIV- 1 entry inhibitors varied. Most intriguingly, envelopes cloned from infants infected during delivery exhibited a faster entry phenotype than maternal isolates. Together, these findings provide further insight into viral variant selection during mother-to-child <b>transmission.</b> <b>Identification</b> of properties shared by mucosally transmitted viral variants may allow them to be selectively targeted, resulting in improved methods for preventing HIV- 1 transmission...|$|E
40|$|Unravelling the {{complexities}} of a disease with multiple wildlife host and multiple tsetse vector species is no easy task. After over a century of field observations, experimental studies, anecdotal evidence and conjecture, the role of wildlife in the transmission of trypanosomes is still unclear. Recently, however, frameworks used in the studies of other vector-borne diseases with wildlife reservoirs showed {{that not only is}} it possible to understand transmission, but that spatio-temporal predictions of human disease risk and targeted control are realistic aims, even in such complex systems. This thesis explores the epidemiology of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem in Northern Tanzania, where recent cases in tourists have highlighted the disease as a public health and economic concern. Assessment of the prevalence of trypanosome infections in different wildlife species {{is the first step in}} investigating the relative importance of different species in disease <b>transmission.</b> <b>Identification</b> of trypanosomes relies on sensitive and specific diagnostic tests. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols based on interspecies differences in the length of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions have been widely used in livestock to identify multiple trypanosome species in one PCR reaction. This study represents the first assessment of these protocols on blood samples collected from wildlife. Clonal sequence analysis of PCR products revealed a large range of trypanosomes circulating in wildlife, including Trypanosoma congolense, Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma simiae Tsavo, Trypanosoma godfreyi and Trypanosoma vivax. In addition sequences similar to known sequences, termed Trypanosoma simiae-like and T. vivax-like trypanosomes, may reflect further diversity. However, further characterisation is needed before ITS protocols can be used widely for epidemiological studies in wildlife. The prevalence of T. brucei s. l. and T. congolense varied widely between species. This variation was predominantly explained by taxonomic classification, suggesting intrinsic differences in response to trypanosomes. Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, the subspecies responsible for HAT, was identified in lion, hyaena and reedbuck. Age significantly affected the prevalence of T. congolense in lion and hyaena, with the highest prevalence in subadults. The lack of statistically significant differences in prevalence between animals sampled live or after death confirmed that post-mortem sampling provides a method for increasing sample sizes in wildlife studies. The complex relationship between tsetse density and prevalence of trypanosome infections illustrated the difficulties of assessing data from diverse ecosystems with many potential confounding factors. A cross-sectional study of Glossina swynnertoni and Glossina pallidipes, the main tsetse species in Serengeti, highlighted the difficulties of integrating the results of microscopy and PCR to generate meaningful measures of the prevalence of transmissible T. brucei infections for epidemiological studies. However, PCR results suggested that G. pallidipes may be more important as a vector of T. brucei s. l. than has been previously recognised. Spatial variation in both tsetse density and the prevalence of trypanosome infections suggests human disease risk is heterogeneous. The results of this study, along with relevant literature, are considered within the context of frameworks used for other vector-borne diseases and the implications for disease management discussed.

In a suburban region of Trivandrum, {{the capital city of}} Kerala State in the Indian Union, a cohort of married women from the general population was formed. Nine thousand three hundred and twenty women were identified as eligible and were invited to clinics held in the field for interview and biological samples were collected after obtaining an informed consent. The overall compliance was 43. 5 % giving 4056 women for the study. Two thousand five hundred and thirty five women were interviewed for details on sexual behaviour and genital hygiene. Testing for HPV was done by PCR as per standard protocol at the Institute of Cancer Research Laboratories in Sutton, UK. Prevalence and determinants were studied for all types of HPV. The overall HPV prevalence was 6. 1 %. The prevalence was almost steady across the age groups. Women in the low socio-economic strata had a higher prevalence, 7. 3 % compared to 4 % for those in the higher socio-economic strata. Women who were separated from their husband's had a prevalence of 8. 4 % compared to 5. 9 % for those who were living with their husbands. Women whose husbands used condoms had a low prevalence of 2. 9 % compared to 6 % for those who did not practise any method of contraception. However this was based only on 2 HPV positive women and may not be reliable. Genital hygiene of husband and wife were combined into one variable {{and those who did not}} practice genital hygiene had a high prevalence (24 % versus 7 %). Women who reported promiscuity had a prevalence of 18. 5 % compared to 8. 3 % for those who did not. The prevalence rate was 10. 2 % for women whose husbands had promiscuity compared to 7. 8 % for those who had no report of promiscuity among husbands. Poor socio-economic status, lack of genital hygiene of the couple and promiscuity of women emerged as the independent predictors of HPV infection in this population. The odds ratio for women in the lower social class was 2. 16 (95 % CI 1. 54 - 3. 02) compared to those in the lower social class. The odds ratio was 3. 76 (95 % CI 2. 56 - 5. 51) for having HPV if they and their partners did not practise genital hygiene compared to those with good hygiene. Women who had a history of multiple sexual partners had an odds ratio of 2. 17 (95 % CI 1. 12 - 4. 22) for HPV compared to those who reported no promiscuity. If the factors low socio-economic status, poor genital hygiene and promiscuity of women are considered responsible for HPV infection in this population, then 40. 6 % of the infection can be prevented by improving the socio-economic status of the women, 14. 2 % can be prevented by improving genital hygienic practises of the couple and 2. 3 % can be prevented by women avoiding promiscuity. The reported prevalence of HPV infection is mainly from western populations and they are not comparable to the socio-cultural milieu of the population in Kerala. Premarital sex is considered forbidden and multiple partnerships for women are negligible. Extramarital sexual relations of men seem to be in frequenting commercial sex workers. Identification of genital hygiene and socio-economic status as independent predictors suggests that control of HPV infection can be achieved by improving the living standards of women. The cervical cancer incidence in Trivandrum Cancer Registry was 15 per 100, 000 in 1991 - 92 and there are no organised cervical cytology screening programmes in the area. The subgroup of women who harbour HPV and who might ultimately develop cervical cancer are likely to be those in the low socio-economic strata with poor genital hygiene and multiple sexual partners. This study has raised the problems of general population based epidemiological studies in low resource settings and identified the strategies to overcome them. The main limitation of this study was that all HPV types were considered together in the analysis. The subtyping of HPV was made available later and showed that 50 % were high risk HPV types. Low socio-economic status and poor genital hygiene seem to be exerting their effects independently and this may also suggest a non-sexual route of HPV <b>transmission.</b> <b>Identification</b> of risk factors separately for the oncogenic and non-oncogenic types will be undertaken later as more data accrues and this will help to delineate the differences. The prospects of HPV vaccination and HPV based screening are being considered as options for cervical cancer control. It might take many years for poor countries to establish organised population based screening programmes. Empowerment of women, improvement of living standards, and health education coupled with low intensity Pap smear and provision of equitable resources for treatment can control HPV infection and bring down the cervical cancer incidence in the poor countries of the world.

40|$|This study {{describes}} {{an application of}} Neural Networks for <b>transmission</b> errors <b>identification</b> and correction in binary messages. The network {{is used as a}} classifier of detected hydro-acoustic signals into one of a possible alphabet of symbols. The algorithm used is a Hamming-type Neural Networks classifier associated with the transmission of a Hamming code. This system can detect and correct all transmission errors if the number of errors is {{less than or equal to}} half the Hamming distance between transmitted symbols minus one. Symbols to be transmitted are chosen and associated to messages, assuring that bit to bit non similarities result on the prescribed Hamming distance. The autoassociative error correcting scheme can be used to generate a teaching signal to a supervised learning equalizer tracking the channel non-stationary characteristics. The proposed system is intended for in hydro-acoustic communication applications, and it is currently undergoing sea tests...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a nonparametric test statistic for testing {{the transmission of}} an ailment or trait. It is based on 2 proportions and does not result into inflated calculated � irrespective of how large the number of haplotypes (or transmission loci) can be. It enables the researcher to carry-out a stage by stage monitoring along all identified locus {{with a view to}} detecting the point (or transmission vibrant loci) at which the ailment can just be said to have achieved <b>transmission.</b> The <b>identification</b> of such vibrant loci will enable the researcher to easily identify most prominent causes of ailments since these are the sources for the activities at the transmission loci. All this will also allow the researcher to give hierarchical rankings to the activities at the loci with respect to the transmission of the ailment under study. These claims are illustrated with secondary data for the readers’ perusal...|$|R
30|$|Recently, complex {{networks}} have drawn increasing attention from researchers and engineers in {{virtue of its}} wide applications in many fields, such as World Wide Web, communication networks, social networks, neural networks, epidemic networks, traffic networks, etc. Lots of network models, such as weighted networks [1, 2], directed networks [3, 4], hierarchical networks [5], community networks [6 – 8] are introduced to explore the potential applications better. As is well known, the research on network synchronization is very important due to its potential applications in many fields including secure communication, laser <b>transmission,</b> image <b>identification,</b> information science, and so on [9 – 14]. In recent years, much literature reported the research results of network synchronization, {{and it has become}} a frontier issue [15 – 19]. As a result, different types of network synchronization have been put forward, for example, complete synchronization [20 – 22], phase synchronization [23, 24], projective synchronization [25, 26] and cluster synchronization [27, 28].|$|R
