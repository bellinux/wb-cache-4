Six years later he declined re-election, but the General Assembly elected him anyway, only to have him resign. He served from March 4, 1829 until December 29, 1836. He distinguished himself in the Senate by a speech during the debate on the Foote resolution, which, though merely relating to the survey of the public lands, introduced into the discussion <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> nullification. Clayton favored the extension of the charter for the Second Bank of the United States and his investigation of the Post Office Department led to its reorganization. At various times he served on the Military Affairs, Militia, District of Columbia and Post Office Committees, but his most important position was the Chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee in the 23rd and 24th Congress.|$|E

On [...] Auchinleck dispatched Clarke to Libya with urgent orders to assist in halting the German advances. Before leaving for the Eighth Army headquarters in Gazala, Clarke left a note, which he later described as [...] "begging for <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> deception machinery in the Command to be reviewed completely afresh during his absence." [...] Once on the ground he found a shaken army conducting a hesitant withdrawal, and in urgent need of delaying tactics to slow the German advance. After brainstorming with his team in Cairo, Clarke envisioned Bastion, a deception operation to convince Rommel that his advance on Gazala was heading into a trap. The plan, which involved Victor Jones creating a strong fictional force of 300 tanks on the British right hand flank, {{was in full swing}} during February. The operation appears to have had limited effect. Rommel delayed his advance until May, when British forces were routed at the Battle of Gazala and the Germans resumed their push toward Egypt.|$|E

The article starts from a background in multidisciplinary literature, mostly {{in the area of}} ethnographical and psychological studies, where the concepts of both ‘ownership’ and ‘territoriality’ prove to be inadequate. A dynamic view of space appropriations is chosen instead: starting from ‘outside appropriations’, the presence of marked thresholds is then considered. Secondly, domestic space appropriations within the house are analysed in a purely qualitative way. There are selective and ‘predominant’ appropriations by a single family member and by <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> household; <b>questions</b> <b>of</b> sovereignty and painful ‘proscriptions’ (kingdoms and exiles) arise when specific parts of the house pertain to a given individual. But there are also unstable appropriations which reveal that there are negotiations in progress according to the family’s power dynamics.
