5|$|In 1662, {{the book}} La Logique ou l’Art de Penser was {{published}} anonymously in Paris. The authors presumably were Antoine Arnauld and Pierre Nicole, two leading Jansenists, who worked together with Blaise Pascal. The Latin <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> book is Ars cogitandi, {{which was a}} successful book on logic of the time. The Ars cogitandi consists of four books, with the fourth one dealing with decision-making under uncertainty by considering the analogy to gambling and introducing explicitly {{the concept of a}} quantified probability.|$|E
5|$|Modular {{system of}} architecture, eight {{standard}} grades: Although other texts preceded it, {{such as the}} 'National Building Law' of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) which was partially preserved in other texts, the Yingzao Fashi published in 1103 by the Song Dynasty (960–1279) scholar-official Li Jie (1065–1110) is the oldest known Chinese architectural treatise that has survived fully intact. It contains descriptions and illustrations detailing the cai fen system (材份制) of eight standard dimensions for module components of timber architecture and structural carpentry. The eight standard grades of module timber components in the Yingzao Fashi, with grade I being the largest and grade VIII the smallest, {{were used to determine}} the ultimate proportions and scale of a building as a whole, as all timber hall types—palaces, mansions, ordinary houses, and pavilions—were hierarchically categorized along the lines of which cai fen grade was employed. For example, palace type buildings used only grades I through V, while mansion type buildings never used components larger than grade III and no less than grade VI. In this system of structural carpentry, the smallest grade of VIII is represented by one cai; one cai is equal to the modern equivalent of 15cm (5.9in), while one cai is also divided into fifteen fen (hence the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> modular system).|$|E

25|$|Kurt Land {{directed}} El asalto in 1960 starring Alberto de Mendoza, a crime drama shot {{in black}} and white. Lautaro Murúa, a Chilean actor working in Argentine cinema directed Alias Gardelito in 1961. The film showed strong political and social undertones and is about the difficulty of living an honest life {{in the face of}} an unrelenting poverty. The <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> story is taken from the name of the great Argentine singer Carlos Gardel, the idol of the antihero Toribio portrayed by Alberto Argibay. Toribio's goal in life is to emulate the famous singer and making his own way successfully in the music business. Yet at the same time, he does not stop his illegal means of making ends meet, stealing and petty thievery. Films such as A hierro muere starring Alberto de Mendoza and Olga Zubarry and Accidente 703 in 1962 were often co-produced with Spain and often featured both Argentine and Spanish born actors.|$|E
25|$|Universitario's second title, in 1934, {{generated}} controversy because {{according to}} the season regulations, the season champion would {{be determined by the}} points earned by the senior teams and a fraction of the respective reserve teams. Under these regulations, Alianza Lima would be league champions; however, both senior teams had individually attained six wins, one draw, and one loss and the determining factor was the points obtained in the reserve league. Universitario's officials asked that a play-off between the first division teams be played {{in order to determine the}} season champion. Alianza Lima agreed to the play-off match and was subsequently won by Universitario with a score of 2–1. But according to other sources, this title Universitario won was not the league title itself, but a secondary title; thus creating controversy. Because of that, Alianza Lima considered itself as the champion of this year. However, the Peruvian Football Federation and the Sports Association of Professional Football, both recognize the <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> year belong to Universitario. Furthermore, in 2012 the FIFA published an article in which Universitario appears holding the 1934 championship.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} <b>title</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> pas was Les Aventures Amourouse de Diane {{or simply}} the Pas de Diane and was originally a pas de trois danced by Diana the Roman Goddess of the Hunt, Endymion the shepherd and a satyr, reflecting {{the myth of}} the passion between Diana and Endymion. It is believed that Petipa's inspiration for this pas was a painting by the Russian painter, Karl Bryullov. The traditional version that is danced today is not by Petipa, but by Agrippina Vaganova, who staged her own version of the Pas de Diane when she transferred it into a revival of La Esmeralda in 1935. She altered the scheme by removing the role of the satyr and changing the lead male role to the hunter, Actaeon, with whom Diana dances in the company of twelve of her nymphs. This was a very strange change on Vaganova's part since Diana and Actaeon were not lovers, but had one association when he stumbled upon her bathing naked with her nymphs, after which, she transformed him into a stag and he was hunted down and killed by his own hunting dogs.|$|E
