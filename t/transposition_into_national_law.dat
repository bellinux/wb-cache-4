40|$|The {{transfer}} of undertakings, businesses {{or parts of}} undertakings or businesses by legal transfer or merger determine important changes {{in the structure of}} the participant entities. The change of their juridical organisation has significant consequences on the employees&# 39; rights, reason why, both nationally and internationally, normative acts that would regulate appropriate safeguarding mechanisms have been adopted. The paper aims to analyse the <b>transposition</b> <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> of the communitarian norms in the field. As a result, the legal aspects with regards to which the legislator chose a restrictive transposition, as well as the additional rights established by them in favour of the employees, in comparison to the directive are identified. At the same time, the study emphasizes the aspects with regards to which the Romanian law requires to be changed and therefore makes some proposals de lege ferenda, so that the transposition of the communitarian normative act into national law would be a precise one and consistent to the other dispositions regarding national law...|$|E
40|$|Although new paint {{products}} and technologies have been developed, the sector of paint application still contributes substantially to total {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) emissions. Recent environmental legislation, especially the EU Solvent Emission Directive 1999 / 13 /EC and its <b>transposition</b> <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law,</b> coming into force in 2007, will have an important influence on the sector structure and the associated supply chain, especially for {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). This paper summarises a comprehensive scenario analysis to explore possible future trajectories for the sector. The main focus is on paint application activities, considering in particular the consequences of new environmentally friendly {{products and}} technologies which can be used by SMEs. Four different scenarios representing possible future states of the sector are evaluated, taking into account environmental, technical and socio-economic aspects along the associated supply chain and life cycle. The scenarios allow the formulation of recommendations and guidelines for policy makers and industries. This example confirms that interdisciplinary scenario analysis is a suitable approach to investigate possible future development of an industrial sector. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The {{globalisation}} of markets, {{particularly the}} liberalisation of financial markets, has facilitated merger and acquisition activity {{on a global}} scale. New financial instruments {{and the growth of}} sovereign wealth funds have raised questions regarding the national security and the loss of sovereignty over key economic sectors. The European Union in its ambitions to complete a single market set out to establish a level playing-field: to enhance competitive performance. Policies towards mergers and takeovers were agreed by member states after many years of negotiation. These have encountered institutionally, embedded national differences resulting in some cases in <b>transposition</b> <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> facilitating greater national protection. This article will review the evolution of competition policy and its recent modernisation in the context of liberalisation and the Lisbon agenda. It will analyse the difficulties of harmonisation with the recent extension of liberalisation to include utilities, which in the aforementioned global context of heightened anxieties, has engendered a revival of 'economic nationalism'. This is exemplified in the current French position towards restructuring in the energy sector and its continued protection of 'national champions'. competition policy; economic nationalism; energy policy; European Union; EU single market; French national champions; globalisation; mergers and acquisitions; protectionism; regulation; takeovers; France; competition policy; harmonisation; liberalisation. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceMachine {{readable}} open {{public data}} {{and the issue of}} multilingual web are open challenges promising to transform the relationship between citizens and European institutions. In this context the DALOS project aims at ensuring coherence and alignment in the legislative language, providing law-makers with knowledge management tools to improve the control over the multilingual complexity of European legislation and over the linguistic and conceptual issues involved in its <b>transposition</b> <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>laws.</b> This paper describes the design and implementation activities performed {{on the basis of a}} set of parallel texts in different languages on a specific legal topic. Natural language processing techniques have been applied to automatically build lexicons for each language. Lexical and conceptual multilingual alignment has been accomplished exploiting terms position in parallel documents. An ontology describing entities involved in the chosen domain has been developed in order to provide a semantic description of terms in lexicons. A modular integration of such resources, represented in RDF/OWL standard format, allowed their effective and flexible access from a legislative drafting application prototype, able to enrich legal documents with terms mark-up and semantic annotations...|$|R

Also, in this study we have formulated some critical opinions, supplemented by de lege ferenda proposals which aim the improvement of the national criminal legal system. The innovations consist of both the conducted examination, supplemented by the interpretation of provisions of the Romanian law, the formulated critical opinions and the de lege ferenda proposals.

40|$|Statistics {{available}} from the European Commission indicate that the implementation of EC directives on the environment is a problem. There is a gap between adoption and <b>transposition</b> <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law</b> as well as partial failure in implementation and enforcement. There is a concurrent identified {{gap in the literature}} on comparative implementation research addressed in this thesis, the main objective of which is to analyse the origins of the environmental implementation problem and to develop and test a model of EC environmental implementation which can be used to explain and understand the origins of the current situation. The literature suggests that implementation may be considered as the fulfilling of a dual task. First, the introduction into national law of measures adopted by the EC and second, the installation of a framework at Member State level, which sees to it that the adopted measures are applied and enforced. A model of the EC policy-making and implementation process, based on Easton's systems approach and borrowing from Sabatier and Mazmanian's work on implementation, is employed to structure the analysis. Hypotheses based on four identified composite model variables are tested against evidence from four case studies; the Drinking Water Directive and the Birds Directive in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Of the four investigated model variables, the 'degree of institutional change' shows the best correlation to the degree of implementation success. In the Netherlands a serious obstacle to implementation has been the constitutional system of that Member State. Under the threat of various legal measures against it by the Commission, the Netherlands has amended its constitutional provisions for law-making in order to speed up the process of implementing EC legislation. A similar important change has taken place in the United Kingdom, which was forced to alter its regulatory system on the supply and control of drinking water. The most significant impact of Community effort in environmental matters has been to encourage the convergence and strengthening of national regulation; non-implementation has been a stimulus for the strengthening of Community structures and generated ideas for possible future Community instruments. The model developed and tested has not only proven useful in helping structure the analysis but it has also been of some contributory value in explanation. It has enabled comparison of implementation across environmental policy sectors and across Member States, thus offering potential for further studies in this area...|$|E
40|$|Do laws ever {{deepen the}} crime risks facing {{managers}} and auditors? According {{to the literature}} and drawing upon several research traditions—actuarial, opportunity reduction and sectoral vulnerability studies—a provisional approach to assessment is developed and applied. Some headline risk concepts are: incoherence or lack of clarity of legalisation; potential for opening up opportunities for illegal acts by market participants; {{and the extent to}} which legislation might or might not signal to exposed persons that opportunities exist. This approach is deployed briefly in relation to EC directives on business transparency and auditing and, in more detail, in relation to the Enron debacle. The latter very clearly shows how changes in regulation in two distinct sectors, the energy market and securities (financial instruments), produced an excrescence of risk. Whilst some risks may come from regulation/de-regulation that is intended to directly apply to specific roles (e. g., auditing), other risks come from regulation/de-regulation in adjacent policy areas. Assessment has both to cast its net wide and to drill down to detail, looking for risks in the nooks and crannies of economic practices. In reaching such assessments, it would be most appropriate to ask traders, compliance persons, enforcement agents and jurists how they would understand the provisions of and risks implied by legislative proposals. Whilst officials can steer that process, it seems questionable whether the actual authors of legislative proposals should be asked to critically assess those same proposals, so “Chinese Walls” may be required within the European Commission. Finally, there are questions of the limits to assessment in cases when details of implementation have yet to supplied by future measures. EC Regulations, which do not rely upon <b>transposition</b> <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>laws,</b> may be easer to assess than Directives...|$|R
40|$|For {{many years}} Italy {{has been the}} worst in the class of European {{countries}} failing to regularly and promptly apply European environmental law. In severe cases, this produced serious financial consequences for the Italian State. The articles gathered in this book report the result of a field research on the problems of implementation of European environmental law in Italy which was conducted over two years. Every chapter examines this phenomenon by focusing on the causes and forms of non-implementation to EU environmental law. The first part of this book helps to understand the complexity of the implementation process, particularly with regard to the <b>transposition</b> of directives <b>into</b> <b>national</b> <b>law.</b> In the second part, the book analyzes the most important infringement cases in Italy, for example the problem of waste in Naples, the question of hunting and the air quality monitoring requirements.
