40|$|Conducting {{meetings}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important and frequent activities in a business environment. This paper presents a prototype software environment for managing the complete life-time of telemeetings/teleconferences: modeling telemeetings, conducting telemeetings, archiving telemeetings in a <b>telemeeting</b> database, annotating telemeetings and querying the <b>telemeeting</b> database. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} two {{experiments to}} investigate how stereoscopy and technologies that allow individual eye contact affect {{the impression of}} telepresence in videoconferencing. Telepresence {{is defined as the}} degree to which participants of a <b>telemeeting</b> get the impression of sharing space with the remote site. Results revealed, among other things, that stereoscopy increases telepresence and makes videoconferencing more attractive. In addition, we found that reduced eye contact angles enhance the recognizability of individually addressed nonverbal signals. However, a setup that eliminates horizontal and vertical eye contact angles seems to be advantageous only in conferences with more than two persons per site...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} the communication platform that was implemented for the European BETEUS (Broadband Exchange for Trans-European Usage) project. The BETEUS communication platform supports the fast implementation of networked multimedia applications with conference character and CSCW (Computer Supported Collaborative Work) features. The platform exhibits {{the notion of}} a site as one of its main abstractions. A site is a collection of workstations, media input and output devices and switching devices that are, in terms of control, tightly coupled. The available equipment within a site is logically mapped onto nodes, where the definition of a node is application dependent. Connection control in a site is centralized within a connection management entity. A site management entity residing on top of the connection management provides high level connection and session abstractions to applications. Applications can run within a site as well as span multiple sites, in which case application and connection control is distributed among the involved sites. So far, two applications have been implemented on top of the platform: a <b>telemeeting</b> application and a tele-tutoring application. The ease with which these applications could be implemented justifies the extra-effort that went into the development of a platform. ...|$|E
50|$|Several {{types of}} {{meetings}} are offered at SAA: in-person meetings, <b>telemeetings,</b> and online meetings. Meetings can be mixed (meaning {{both men and}} women attend) or gender-specific (men-only meetings vs. women-only meetings). Meetings that are advertised as closed are “open only to those individuals who have a desire to stop their addictive behavior"; in contrast, open meetings are “open to anyone interested in…SAA,” regardless of whether the individual has expressed a desire to change. Additionally, <b>telemeetings,</b> or meetings via conference calls, and internet-based meetings are sources of real-time support outside of the traditional in-person meeting. In the United States, SAA meetings are held in all fifty states as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.|$|R
