When signature and interval are fixed, ambiguity still remains as which coordinate is the time coordinate. It may be the fourth, or it may be the zeroth. This is not an exhaustive list of notational inconsistencies.

Central Bank of Iceland governor Davíð Oddsson later clarified that the loan was still being negotiated. According to RÚV, prime minister Geir Haarde had been investigating the possibility of a Russian loan since the mid-summer. When questioned on the matter in a press conference, Geir Haarde said: [...] "We have not received the kind of support that we were requesting from our friends.

Steiner also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts on the Holocaust, but also about the horrific events that took place in countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, El Salvador and Burundi: [...] "My feeling is <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> grapple with the abyss if one can."

[...] In Coveney's phrase, [...] "His oddness was ever startling and never {{hardened}} into mere eccentricity." [...] Richardson would introduce colleagues to his ferrets by name, ride at high speed on his powerful motor-bike in his seventies, have a parrot flying round his study eating his pencils, or take a pet mouse out for a stroll, but behind such unorthodox behaviour there was a closely guarded self who remained an enigma to even his closest colleagues. Tynan wrote in The New Yorker that Richardson [...] "made me feel that I have known this man all my life and that I have never met anyone who more adroitly buttonholed me while keeping me firmly at arm's length." ...|$|E

500|$|Denmark has a blasphemy law, {{which makes}} it an offence to [...] "mock legal {{religions}} and faiths". However, no-one {{has been charged with}} the law since 1971 and no-one has been convicted since 1938. A complaint was filed against Jyllands-Posten under this section of the law, but in his decision the Regional Public Prosecutor stated [...] "that in assessing what constitutes an offence under both section 140 and section 266 b of the Danish Criminal Code, the right to freedom of expression must be taken into consideration"; he found that no criminal offence had taken place in this case. However, the Director of Public Prosecutions said, [...] "there is, therefore, no free and unrestricted right to express opinions about religious subjects. It is thus not a correct description of existing law when the article in Jyllands-Posten states that it is incompatible with the right to freedom of expression to demand special consideration for religious feelings and <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> be ready to put up with 'scorn, mockery and ridicule'." [...] Utterances intended for public dissemination deemed hateful based on 'race, colour, national or ethnic origin, belief or sexual orientation' can be penalised under Section 266b of the criminal code. Some people have been convicted under this provision, mostly for speech directed at Muslims.|$|E

Aggression was released in October of the same year, and was made available on iTunes on December 7.

As of April 2007, he speculates that a new solo release will be ready {{by the end of the}} year. After establishing recognition on Ultimate Fighter, Klepacki began scoring themes for HDNet's Inside the MMA and HDNet Fights in autumn 2007. Around this time, he made it to the district finals of the Guitar Center [...] "drum-off" [...] competition after winning two store challenges in Las Vegas but was eliminated. His solo album Infiltrator was released in April 2009. According to Klepacki, the album was inspired by his recent work on the Red Alert series. Klepacki enjoys Las Vegas thanks to its diversity of musical talent and prolific number of shows and attractions. He attributes his showmanship to being raised in the city, noting <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> [...] "stand out" [...] to be noticed among the entertainment atmosphere of Vegas.

2500|$|Prayer plays a {{significant}} role among many believers. Muslims believe that the purpose of existence is to worship God. He is viewed as a personal God and there are no intermediaries, such as clergy, to contact God. Prayer often also includes supplication and asking forgiveness. God is often believed to be forgiving. For example, a hadith states God would replace a sinless people with one who sinned but still asked repentance. Christian theologian Alister McGrath writes that there are good reasons to suggest that a [...] "personal god" [...] is integral to the Christian outlook, but <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> understand it is an analogy.

On June 13, 1978 the court decided that Hochhuth's claims about illegal behaviour were indeed a libellous charges and banned the author from repeating them. However, The term [...] "a dreadful lawyer" [...] was deemed a judgement of opinion protected by freedom of speech.
