5|$|During {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, the FVdG was <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> localist union {{federation}} into a syndicalist labor organization with anarchist tendencies. The process was initiated by the death of Gustav Keßler, the most important ideologue in the FVdG, in 1903. His role was largely assumed by the physician Raphael Friedeberg.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Hezbollah <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> revolutionary group into a {{political}} one, in a process which is described as the Lebanonisation of Hezbollah.

5|$|The 1994 film Exit to Eden, based loosely on {{the book}} Rice {{published}} as Anne Rampling, starred Rosie O'Donnell and Dan Aykroyd. The work was <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> BDSM-themed love story into a police comedy, and was widely considered a box-office failure, receiving near-universal negative reviews.|$|E
5|$|As the freeholders {{shared the}} mineral royalties, the mines brought {{prosperity}} which {{gave rise to}} the remodelling and redevelopment of much of the village. Green Terrace, which includes the old post office, was built in the 1870s, and Main Street was <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> back lane into the high street. The village school, with working clock and bell tower, was built by the community in 1874, and the stone-built Ibbotson Institute, now the community hall, was completed in 1903.|$|E
5|$|Ottoman {{records from}} 1906 show around 5,000 Circassians living in Amman and {{virtually}} no inhabitants who spoke Arabic. The city's demographics changed dramatically after the Ottoman government's decision {{to construct the}} Hejaz Railway, which linked Damascus and Medina, and facilitated the annual Hajj pilgrimage and trade. Because of its location along the railway, Amman was <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> small village into a major commercial hub in the region.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the extension to Kew Gardens brought significant growth to Queens, specifically in Forest Hills and Kew Gardens. With the subway providing a quick and cheap commute, Forest Hills became a more desirable place to live, {{and as a result}} new apartment buildings were built in advance of the line's opening to accommodate the expected influx of residents. Forest Hills was <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> quiet residential community of one-family houses to an active population center.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 12th century, Angkor Wat {{gradually}} <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Hindu {{centre of}} worship to Buddhism, which continues to the present day. Angkor Wat is unusual among the Angkor temples in that although it was somewhat neglected after the 16th century it was never completely abandoned, its preservation being {{due in part to the}} fact that its moat also provided some protection from encroachment by the jungle.|$|E
5|$|Truman's other appointees to the Court {{provided}} consistent conservative votes, {{and during}} Minton's first {{years on the}} Court it was returned to the conservatism of the William Howard Taft era. While on the Court, Minton <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> New Deal senator into an almost reactionary judge as an ally of Justice Felix Frankfurter. Empirical coding of votes shows that Minton was the most conservative justice on the Court during his first year, and remained in the conservative half of the court {{for the duration of}} his career.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} Soviet Union, the Armenian SSR <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> largely {{agricultural}} hinterland to {{an important}} industrial production center, while its population almost quadrupled from around 880,000 in 1926 to 3.3 million in 1989 due to natural growth and large-scale influx of Armenian Genocide survivors and their descendants. On August 23, 1990, it was renamed the Republic of Armenia after its sovereignty was declared, but remained in the Soviet Union until its official proclamation of independence on 21 September 1991. Its independence was recognized on 26 December 1991 when the Soviet Union ceased to exist. After {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union, the state of the post-Union Republic of Armenia existed until the adoption of the new constitution in 1995.|$|E
5|$|In AD 6, Judea, Idumea, and Samaria were <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> client {{kingdom of}} the Roman Empire into an {{imperial}} province, also called Judea. A Roman prefect, rather than a client king, ruled the land. The prefect ruled from Caesarea Maritima, leaving Jerusalem to be run by the High Priest of Israel. As an exception, the prefect came to Jerusalem during religious festivals, when religious and patriotic enthusiasm sometimes inspired unrest or uprisings. Gentile lands surrounded the Jewish territories of Judea and Galilee, but Roman law and practice allowed Jews to remain separate legally and culturally. Galilee was evidently prosperous, and poverty was limited enough {{that it did not}} threaten the social order.|$|E
5|$|In recent decades, South Dakota {{has been}} <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> state {{dominated}} by agriculture to {{one with a}} more diversified economy. The tourism industry has grown considerably since {{the completion of the}} interstate system in the 1960s, with the Black Hills becoming more important as a destination. The financial service industry began to grow in the state as well, with Citibank moving its credit card operations from New York to Sioux Falls in 1981, a move that has been followed by several other financial companies. South Dakota was the first state to eliminate caps on interest rates.|$|E

5|$|On May 8, 1958, the Maryland State Roads Commission and Cecil County {{signed a}} road {{transfer}} agreement to turn maintenance of MD 537B {{outside the town}} of Chesapeake City to county maintenance. However, the portion of MD 537B from US 213 to the north town limit was returned to state maintenance through an August 22, 1961, road transfer agreement. MD 285 and MD 537B were resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1971 and 1976, respectively. The intersection of MD 537B and MD 284 was <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> tangent intersection to the present orthogonal intersection in 1982. The following year, the portion of MD 537B between MD 213 and the intersection of Biddle and Lock streets was renumbered {{as an extension of}} MD 285.|$|E
5|$|The city cemetery, the Kilden {{park and}} the modern art museum, Kunsten, are in the modern {{commercial}} and administrative area around the railway station to the west. Beyond this, Hasseris has become a residential district {{with a number of}} large villas and detached houses. The city's main development area is now to the east of the centre although in addition to the university and new areas of housing, it still contains the shipping harbor, Østhavnen, and the cement factory. The waterfront to the northeast of the centre is being <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> harbour into a recreational area with the Utzon Center and Musikkens Hus.|$|E
5|$|The often uproarious and {{spectacular}} Cuocolo trial attracted {{a lot of}} attention of newspapers and the general public both in Italy {{as well as in the}} United States, including by Pathé's Gazette. The trial was <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> murder trial into one against the Camorra as a whole. The hearings began in the spring of 1911 and would continue for twelve months. Fabbroni intended to use the trial to strike the final blow to the Camorra. The trial was attended by the former mayor of New York City, George B. McClellan, in whose administration Petrosino was killed.|$|E

5|$|The path {{originated}} as a {{route for}} the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They {{needed to be}} able to look down into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct path between two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard but it has been <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.|$|E
5|$|US 213 {{was moved}} to the new Chesapeake City Bridge, and MD 537 was {{assigned}} to the bypassed portions of highway approaching and within Chesapeake City. On May 8, 1958, the Maryland State Roads Commission and Cecil County signed a road transfer agreement to turn maintenance of the approach roads outside the town of Chesapeake City to county maintenance. These roads included all of MD 537A, most of MD 537D, and much of MD 537B. The portion of MD 537B from US 213 to the north town limit was returned to state maintenance through an August 22, 1961, road transfer agreement. All three segments of MD 537 were resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1976. The intersection of MD 537B and MD 284 was <b>transformed</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> tangent intersection to the present orthogonal intersection in 1982. The following year, the portion of MD 537B between MD 213 and MD 285's then western terminus at the intersection of Biddle and Lock streets was renumbered as an extension of MD 285. The remainder of MD 537B not maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was transferred to Chesapeake City in 2015.|$|E
