40|$|Abstract: The {{design of}} coach {{electronically}} controlled air suspension control system {{was made to}} be optimized and simplified, especially in hardware. The opto-coupler, inset in the input channels and output channels, let the electric be independent each other between computer system and the external environment and had own reference potential. Interfering signals which maybe make the system not to work by any possibility was suppressed. Practice has proved that reliability, safety and practicality of the control system had been greatly improved. An overview of the structure and principle of the control system The typical bus electronically controlled air suspension (ECAS) is mainly composed of two parts, first part is mainly for {{the structure of the}} device, the second is the exhaust gas line and control system. When the bus is traveling on the road, each sensor in the ECAS will continue collecting the vehicle speed signal, the acceleration signal of the body perpendicular to the direction, the steering wheel angle signal, the vehicle height signal, brake signal, gate signal for the control system judgment bus conditions and road conditions to provide real-time basis. ECAS can effectively inhibit the <b>turning</b> <b>roll</b> in driving, brake nod straight bumps and othe...|$|E
50|$|The {{outcome of}} an at-bat largely {{depends on the}} player cards. The player whose pitcher is {{pitching}} that <b>turn</b> <b>rolls</b> a die {{to determine whether the}} batting player rolls on the pitcher's chart or the batter's chart. Each of the two charts has a list of possible results from the at-bat.|$|R
50|$|When {{starting}} the match, each player rolls one die, {{to determine who}} will start. If it's a tie, the players roll again. But, unlike the regular backgammon, the already-rolled dice are disregarded and the player that won the first <b>turn</b> <b>rolls</b> both dice to begin. In the next game in the match, the player that won the previous has the first turn.|$|R

50|$|A valve is {{a device}} that regulates, directs or {{controls}} the flow of a fluid (gases, liquids, fluidized solids, or slurries) by opening, closing, or partially obstructing various passageways. Valves are technically fittings, but are usually discussed as a separate category. In an open valve, fluid flows in a direction from higher pressure to lower pressure. The word {{is derived from the}} Latin valva, the moving part of a door, in turn from volvere, to <b>turn,</b> <b>roll.</b>|$|R

50|$|Bodyflight, or 'body flight', {{is the art}} of 'flying your body' in a {{controlled}} manner. This include <b>turns,</b> <b>rolls,</b> lateral movement, fall rate control, and other acrobatics in the air. The skill of bodyflight makes it possible for skydivers to fly closer to each other while they are falling, to allow them to link together in formation skydiving, then fly apart to a safe distance before opening parachutes. Many skills of bodyflight can be learned in a vertical wind tunnel, to enable skydivers to become better at controlling their bodies in the sky.|$|R
5000|$|Erich Hartmann, the World's top scoring fighter ace, {{claiming}} 352 victories, flew {{only the}} Bf 109G, {{of which he}} said: It was very manoeuvrable, and {{it was easy to}} handle. It speeded up very fast, if you dived a little. And in the acrobatics manoeuver, you could spin with the 109, and go very easy out of the spin. The only problems occurred during takeoff. It had a strong engine, and a small, narrow-tread undercarriage. If you took off too fast it would <b>turn</b> <b>roll</b> ninety degrees away. We lost a lot of pilots in takeoffs.|$|R

50|$|Lemper is an Indonesian savoury snack made of {{glutinous rice}} filled with {{seasoned}} shredded chicken, fish or abon (meat floss). The specific lemper filled with seasoned shredded chicken is called lemper ayam (lit: chicken lemper). The meat filling is rolled inside the rice, {{in a fashion}} similar to an egg roll; this is in <b>turn</b> <b>rolled</b> and wrapped inside a banana leaf, oil paper, plastic sheet or tinfoil to make a packet ready for serving. If banana leaf is not available, corn husk can be used. Lemper are most often seen as snacks, but may sometimes be served as appetizers as well. Lemper usually have an elongated shape, similar to lontong.|$|R
50|$|A barrel <b>roll</b> <b>turn,</b> {{or simply}} barrel <b>roll,</b> is a <b>turn</b> that {{involves}} casting the arms up and leaping {{into the air}} and rotating 360 degrees while airborne. While airborne, the performer's back may be arched and the head may be cast back. It starts and ends with the performer facing forward. Barrel <b>roll</b> <b>turns</b> are commonly used in tap and jazz dancing.|$|R
40|$|Each of two players, by <b>turns,</b> <b>rolls</b> a dice {{several times}} accumulating the {{successive}} scores until {{he decides to}} stop, or he rolls an ace.

In this paper we formulate this game in the framework of competitive Markov decision processes (also known as stochastic games), show that the game has a value, provide an algorithm to compute the optimal minimax strategy, and present results of this algorithm in three different variants of the game.

The incident occurred following a family squabble. Making matters worse, Keough wandered away after the accident. He said that he did not flee the scene, as some reports had indicated, but he was so disoriented that he walked toward some nearby shops where he was tracked down by police officers. His blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Department.|$|R

5000|$|On modern cars {{the front}} {{suspension}} and steering links are {{designed so that}} during a <b>turning</b> maneuver, body <b>roll</b> and suspension motions will not influence the car to turn more sharply than the driver anticipates. On modern cars, {{the leading edge of}} the front tires move outwards as the suspension is compressed, and inwards as the suspension droops (extends). This is known as [...] "toe out" [...] under bump and results in roll understeer. I.E. During a <b>turn,</b> body <b>roll</b> will cause the outside suspension (relative to the curve) to compress and the inside suspension to droop (extend).|$|R

50|$|Basic fighter {{maneuvers}} {{consist of}} many varying tactical <b>turns,</b> <b>rolls,</b> and other actions {{to get behind}} or above an enemy, before the opponent can do the same. BFM are typically universal maneuvers which can be performed in almost any fighter aircraft, and are usually considered to be training maneuvers. Training usually begins with pilots flying {{the same type of}} aircraft, pitting only their skills against each other. In advanced training, pilots learn to fly against opponents in different types of aircraft, so pilots must learn to cope with different technological advantages as well, which more resembles real combat. In actual air combat maneuvering, variations of these basic maneuvers may become necessary, depending on the different types of aircraft involved, the weapon systems each side is using, and the number of aircraft involved.|$|R

50|$|When {{generating}} a character a player rolls 3D6 for Strength, Dexterity, Luck, Mentality, Charisma, and Constitution.

50|$|Rolling Rock Club was {{originally}} 12000 acre of land owned by Judge Thomas Mellon, who {{left it to}} his son Richard Beatty Mellon, brother of Andrew Mellon and onetime president of Mellon Bank. Richard Beatty Mellon <b>turned</b> <b>Rolling</b> Rock into a rural retreat for {{his friends and family}} to hunt, fish, and ride. From this it steadily developed into an establishment that, in addition to the usual country club necessities — swimming pool and golf course — also boasted stocked trout streams, duck ponds, game birds and shooting ranges. The Club also kept a pack of English fox hounds, raising pheasants, and running the Gold Cup Steeplechase (from 1933 until 1983). R.B. Mellon left the estate to his son, Richard King Mellon, when he died in 1933.
