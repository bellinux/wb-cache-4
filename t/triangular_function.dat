The disturbance force vector is first transformed and rotated to the orbital frame {{so that it}} can be used in the simplified Gaussian equations of satellite motion. Then, the force vector is expanded to <b>triangular</b> <b>functions</b> of the Keplerian angular elements and the disturbances are separated into three parts: short-periodic terms with <b>triangular</b> <b>functions</b> of M, long-periodic terms with <b>triangular</b> <b>functions</b> of (ω, i) and secular terms [non-periodic functions of (a, e) ] with a program using mathematical symbolic operation software. The integrations are then carried out with respect to M, (ω, i) and t, respectively, to obtain {{the analytical}} solutions of satellite orbits disturbed by atmospheric drag. Some interesting conclusions are obtained theoretically. The atmospheric disturbance force is not a function of Ω. The semimajor axis a of the orbital ellipse is reduced in a constant and strong manner by the air disturbance; the shape of the ellipse (eccentricity e) changes towards a more circular orbit in a linear and weak manner.

A load sensor developed for measurements of elastic impact forces and the designed vibration exciter are also discussed briefly.

For {{the assessment of the}} impact on vibrations of the non-excited beam, the periodical measured impact forces are approximated by <b>triangular</b> <b>functions,</b> which are then resolved harmonically with the complex Fourier method. If the natural frequencies of the non-excited beam are within the excitation spectrum of the generated impacts, the finite element models of both beams have to be considered in numerical simulations. The discussed Fourier decomposition of the <b>triangular</b> <b>functions</b> representing the analysed impact forces can be a useful engineering tool for the elaboration of the effective dynamic models of the elastic structures being in periodical impacts...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{concerns}} <b>triangular</b> <b>function</b> analysis including <b>triangular</b> <b>function</b> {{series and}} <b>triangular</b> <b>function</b> transformation, {{which is very}} similar to Fourier analysis based on sine and cosine functions. Besides sine-cosine functions, triangular functions are frequently-used and easily-generated periodic functions in electronics as well, so it is an urgent practical problem to study the basic properties of triangular functions and the fundamental theory of <b>triangular</b> <b>function</b> analysis. We show that triangular functions and sine-cosine functions not only have the similar graphs, but also possess similar analysis properties. Any continuous periodic function may be approximated uniformly by linear combinations of triangular functions as well as trigonometric functions, and every function f(x) ϵ L 2 [−π,π] has a <b>triangular</b> <b>function</b> series as well as a Fourier series. Since the triangular functions are nonorthogonal in L 2 [−π,π], the orthonormalization is discussed so that a function f(x) ϵ L 2 [−π,π] can be approximated best by a superposition of given finite triangular functions. Finally, we introduce the theory of the <b>triangular</b> <b>function</b> transformation in L 2 (−∞, ∞), which has a close relation with Fourier transformation.
