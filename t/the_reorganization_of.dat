5|$|From the 1920s {{through the}} 1970s the {{laboratory}} was used mainly for faculty and graduate research, with two courses offered to undergraduate students in introductory and advanced beekeeping {{as well as}} a single course offered to the public in the summers.

5|$|In 1944, Pierlot began {{drawing up}} plans for <b>the</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> the Belgian Army after the liberation, {{known as the}} Pierlot Plan (Plan Pierlot).

In the longer term, these troops would form the core of a new division around which more troops could be raised.|$|E
5|$|In France, the premiership of Aristide Briand, {{a leading}} proponent of {{engaging}} with Constantine {{to bring about}} a reconciliation of the two Greek administrations, was threatened by the events in Athens, leading to <b>the</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> the French government. In Britain, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and foreign minister Sir Edward Grey resigned and were replaced by Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour. The change in the British leadership proved to be particularly important for Greece, since Lloyd George was a known Hellenophile, an admirer of Venizelos and dedicated to resolving the Eastern Question.|$|E

5|$|The college had a precipitous {{decline in}} {{enrollment}} and financial stability {{during and after}} the Great Depression, weathering the storm under five successive presidents. Its survival was due in part to <b>the</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> the six-year preparatory program into a four-year junior college program and in part to steep salary reductions. In 1943, Shimer president Albin C. Bro invited the Department of Education at the University of Chicago to evaluate the college community; its 77 recommendations became the basis for Shimer's transformation from a conservative finishing school to a nontraditional, co-educational four-year college.|$|E
5|$|As war approached, it {{was decided}} to retain her as a {{minelayer}} and most of the extra fire control equipment was removed. She was transferred to Brest as part of <b>the</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> the 5e Escadre. She sailed for Casablanca, French Morocco on 2 September with 125 Bréguet mines embarked. She was ordered to lay a defensive minefield there on 4 September, but this order was rescinded the next day, after the mines had already been fuzed, and the ship was ordered to disembark the mines. While landing the mines on 13 September one of them exploded, destroying the ship and killing 186 people. A further 73 crewmen and 47 others were injured and significant damage was caused by flying debris. One gun and some armor was salvaged during the war, but demolition work did not begin until October 1952 and was completed by July 1953.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> legal {{education}} in Ontario in the mid-1950s, Queen's Faculty of Law opened in 1957 {{in the newly}} built John A. Macdonald Hall.

By {{the end of the}} 1960s, like many other universities in Canada, Queen's tripled its enrolment and greatly expanded its faculty, staff, and facilities, {{as a result of the}} baby boom and generous support from the public sector. By the mid-1970s, the number of full-time students had reached 10,000. Among the new facilities were three more residences and separate buildings for the Departments of Mathematics, Physics, Biology and Psychology, Social Sciences and the Humanities.|$|E

5|$|Harvard had so {{much trouble}} finding a {{replacement}} for Gray that they considered hiring a European, but they found an American and hired George Lincoln Goodale in late 1872. Goodale had a medical degree from Harvard and a solid knowledge of botany. By late June 1873 Goodale had enough experience that Gray was exalted to pronounce he had taught his last class. William Gilson Farlow also had a medical degree from Harvard and had studied botany. He became Gray's assistant in 1870 after obtaining his medical degree and then studied in Europe for a few years. He returned to Harvard in 1874 and became a botany professor. Sereno Watson began helping Gray with taxonomy in 1872 and became the herbarium curator. <b>The</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> botany at Harvard in the early 1870s was a major accomplishment of Gray's.|$|E
5|$|Malta had {{organised}} the Consulato del Mare (Consulate of the Sea) for {{the first}} time on 1 September 1697 per initiative of Grandmaster Perellos. At the consulate it was decided that four merchants familiar enough with maritime procedures shall be appointed consuls to administer justice, on similar approach to Barcellona and Messina. Perellos had established foreign relations between Malta and Russia in 1698, {{for the first}} time, exactly a century before the Order's expulsion from Malta. During his grandmastership the coastal fortifications of Malta were strengthened by the construction of batteries, redoubts, and entrenchments. He also was the driving force behind the third rate squadron of the order which was eventually inaugurated in 1705. In 1707 he entrusted Romano Carapecchia with <b>the</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> the drainage system in Valletta.|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1958 the 95th Infantry Division was redesignated as the 95th Division (Training) {{and a major}} {{reorganization}} of mission assignments was underway. Personnel trained for infantry combat, field artillery, military police and combat support roles were now to undergo re-training {{to enable them to}} train others. The division had a new role as one of the 13 Training Divisions in the Army Reserve. The same year the division's size increased as the 291st Regiment was reassigned again from the 75th and was redesignated as 291st Regiment (Advanced Individual Training). With <b>the</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> the division all of the regiments were redesignated. The 95th Divisional Artillery became the 95th Regiment (Common Specialist Training) with headquarters at Shreveport, Louisiana. The 377th became the 377th Regiment (Basic Combat Training), as did the 378th and 379th, and all were reassigned new training sites. In 1966, the division received a distinctive unit insignia.|$|E

5|$|Other units {{dating back}} to the 18th century were given the {{designation}} 5th Regiment Massachusetts Militia. They were formed and disbanded repeatedly over more than a century prior to the Civil War. These included a regiment that served during King George's War in the Siege of Louisbourg in 1745. During the Revolutionary War, the 5th Massachusetts Regiment saw action at the Battle of Bunker Hill, New York Campaign, Battle of Trenton, Battle of Princeton and Battle of Saratoga. The 5th Massachusetts that saw service during the Civil War was formed during <b>the</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> the Massachusetts militia in 1855. At that time of its formation, the regiment was commanded by Colonel Charles B. Rogers. By the start of the Civil War in 1861, Samuel C.

5|$|The 6th Massachusetts {{regiment}} {{that served}} during the Civil War {{was formed in}} 1855 during <b>the</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> the Massachusetts militia.

They were formed and disbanded at various times and although they shared the same numerical designation, there was no continuous unit known as the 6th Massachusetts. One of the units designated as the 6th Massachusetts was a regiment that served during King George's War in the Siege of Louisbourg in 1745. During the Revolutionary War, the 6th Massachusetts Regiment was engaged in the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Battle of Harlem Heights, the Battle of Trenton and the Battle of Saratoga.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure to}} {{identify}} <b>the</b> <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> the defenses {{was a rare}} intelligence breakdown for the Allies. Post-action reports still documented the original estimate and assumed that the 352nd had been deployed to the coastal defenses by chance, a few days previously, {{as part of an}} anti-invasion exercise. The source of this inaccurate information came from German prisoners of war from the 352nd Infantry Division captured on D-Day as reported by the 16th Infantry S-3 D-Day Action Report. In fact, Allied intelligence had already become aware of the relocation of the 352nd Infantry Division on June 4. This information was passed on to V Infantry Corps and 1st Infantry Division HQ through 1st Army, but at that late stage in the operations, no plans were changed.|$|E
