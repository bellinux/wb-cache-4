50|$|Anthrenus sarnicus, the Guernsey <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle,</b> {{is a type}} of <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle.</b> It can be {{generally}} found in Great Britain. Its suborder is Polyphaga, the infraorder is Bostrichiformia, the superfamily is Bostrichoidea, and the family is Dermestidae. The <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> is shaped like an oval and {{about the size of a}} pin.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} predators like ants and spiders will feed on <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae. No predators will {{exclusively}} eat <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> and the larvae will hide in dark places to avoid them.|$|R
50|$|All <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> will {{go through}} {{metamorphism}} during their lives. They will pass through the egg, larval, and pupal points to reach full maturity. This can take two months to many years. Female <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> can lay over 100 eggs which can hatch after 7-35 days. Four generations of <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> can develop every year. It can take 9 months to 2 years for a <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> to become a full adult. However, adults only survive {{for a couple of}} weeks. On the plus side for the beetles, the adults are skillful fliers and can live for many weeks without food.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae {{start to}} feed {{as soon as}} they hatch. They are carrot shaped and heavily covered with setae, {{especially}} on their posterior end. The number of instars differ from 5-11 and in some cases reach up to 20. Larvae of the black <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> Attagenus megatoma may grow up to 1/2 inch (12 mm) and be yellow to brown in color. Other types of <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> are regularly 1/4 to 1 inch (6 to 25 mm) long and covered with dark setae. Certain species have distinctive tufts of setae extending from their posterior end. These beetles are attracted to soiled fabrics and crevices where dead insects may serve as a food source. The larvae of the <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> are often referred to as [...] "woolly bears" [...] or [...] "buffalo moths".|$|R

50|$|This beetle is 2 to 3.5 {{millimeters}} {{long and}} round in shape. It is black with variable patterns {{of white and}} yellow mottling. The legs are covered in yellow scales. It looks similar to other <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles,</b> but its tiny body scales are rounded or oval, while those of other <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> are longer and narrower. Each antenna is tipped with a club.|$|R

40|$|The common fabric {{destroying}} {{insects in}} Nebraska are clothes moths, <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles,</b> and silverfish. Clothes moths and <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> feed on and digest wool, leather, cotton, silk, and synthetic fibers. They generally infest clothes, carpets, rugs, upholstery, etc. Silverfish feed principally on paper products, glue, paste, wallpaper, starch, and any food products consumed by humans. They also damage clothing, cotton, linen, rayon and ramie fabrics. This extension circular explains these insects {{and the proper}} ways of eliminating them in your household...|$|R
50|$|Pyrethroid {{insecticides}} {{can be used}} {{to control}} <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles.</b> Products containing active ingredients such as permethrin, bifenthrin, deltamethrin, tralomethrin are components of the Pyrethroid insecticide.|$|R

50|$|<b>Carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> {{are well}} known for eating away at our carpets and rugs. Their diet {{consists}} of feathers, furs, insects, dead animals, processed human food, skins, cotton, silk, and wool.|$|R
50|$|Pests {{are another}} {{significant}} threat to textile collections, {{as there are}} a number of creatures which can cause damage to fibres. Among the most common are clothes moths, <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles,</b> silverfish, firebrats and rodents.|$|R
25|$|Some {{imidazole}} derivatives show {{effects on}} insects, for example sulconazole nitrate exhibits a strong anti-feeding {{effect on the}} keratin-digesting Australian <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae Anthrenocerus australis, as does econazole nitrate with the common clothes moth Tineola bisselliella.|$|R
50|$|Like clothes moths, <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> are {{likewise}} {{drawn to}} proteins, {{and can be}} quite destructive. Evidence of an infestation may take of the form of chewed holes, carcasses, or larvae, which appear as small pale worm-like insects.|$|R
50|$|Anthrenus is a genus of beetles in {{the family}} Dermestidae, the skin beetles. One of several genera of <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles,</b> Anthrenus was {{historically}} placed in a subfamily Anthreninae, though presently included in the Megatominae. The genus Neoanthrenus is closely related.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the ability of domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) to detect the scent of <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae (Anthrenocerus australis). These insects were introduced to New Zealand and are now a pest of woollen carpets and fabrics in this country. The use of detector dogs can help with earlier discovery and identification of infested areas and thus reduce the use of pesticides. Sixteen harrier hounds were available for this study, however only six dogs were selected for the actual trials after initial training. There were four trials, in which the dogs had to detect four different stimuli (dog food A, <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae, cockroaches and dog food B). Each run evaluated whether the dog could identify the target pottle out of six pottles. The other five pottles were empty. A dog completed six runs each day over five days for food A and over three days for the other three stimuli. Therefore there were a total of 30 runs for food A and 18 runs {{for the rest of}} the stimuli. A run was considered successful when the dog found the target pottle on the first try (i. e. first pass around the circle) without any false positives (sitting at a pottle that did not contain the stimulus). The dogs were able to identify dog food A and B with an average success of 74. 5 % and 78. 9 % respectively. The detection rate for dog food was significantly higher than would be expected if the dogs were selecting pottles at random (z ≥ 1. 64, p < 0. 05). However they were unable to identify either the <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae or cockroaches, with an average success of only 27. 7 % and 45. 5 % respectively. These results indicate that the dogs were incapable of detecting <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae. This could be due to several reasons such as dog breed, learning inflexibility, handler influences and methodology. The dogs used may have not been the best choice for this experiment, however they were chosen based on availability. The dogs were trained first on food before the insect trials, hence they may not have been able to create a new association between the reinforcer and insect stimuli. The handler and her techniques may have influenced the dogs to select the target pottle unintentionally (e. g. longer pauses at the target pottle) as there was a higher success rate for formal tests compared to blind tests (in which the handler did not know where the target pottle was) (Z = - 3. 5, p = 0. 0005). Future studies could look at the ability of other dog breeds to detect <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles.</b> More research should be done on the effects of temperament in scent detection dogs. Future research could investigate if detector dogs can differentiate between different <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> species and if they are able to detect <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> in the field (i. e. in museums or houses) ...|$|R
50|$|Anthrenus (Anthrenus) scrophulariae, {{also known}} as the common <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle,</b> is a species of beetle found in Europe, the Middle East and the Nearctic. In Europe, it is found in almost every country. The beetle may {{frequently}} be found on Euphorbia cyparissias.|$|R
5000|$|Anthrenocerus australis is {{a species}} of beetle in the family Dermestidae, the skin beetles. It is known {{commonly}} as the Australian <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle.</b> It is native to Australia, New Guinea, and New Zealand, and it is present in Europe as an introduced species.|$|R
30|$|Wool {{and other}} hair fibres used for {{producing}} carpets, blanket and shawl etc. due to having properties like warmth, softness and flame retardancy. Specially, wool-based materials {{due to its}} protein content are prone to attack of moth and other insects. Moth is an insect and its larvae eat the protein present in wool. Cloths moth (Tineola bisselliella) and <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> (Anthrenus verbasci) are common moths attacking the wool materials. DDT (Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), permethrin, permethrin/hexahydro pyrimidine derivative, cyhalothrin, etc. {{are some of the}} chemicals used as antimoth finishing agents. Nano TiO 2 particles were also utilized as an antifeeding compound on wool fabric against larvae of the <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle,</b> Anthrenus verbasci, feeds on protein fibers [133]. All the chemicals used for antimoth finishing are associated with ecological disturbance and so, natural colorants may be perfect substitutes for them. Shakyawar et al. screened saffron flower waste, onion skin, henna, myrobolan, silver oak leaf, madder, walnut, dholkanali and yellow root natural dye sources for antimoth finishing and found best results for silver oak leaves, walnut husk and pomegranate rind [134]. Natural dyes cochineal, madder, and walnut (quinines) and chestnut, fustic, indigo, and logwood (flavonoids) were applied on wool and tested for antimoth properties against black <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles.</b> All of the dyes, except indigo, increased the insect resistance of the wool fabric but flavonoid dyes were not so effective in enhancing insect resistance. Metallic mordants were found not having significant effect on insect resistance with all natural dyes used. The anthraquinone dyes including cochineal, madder, and walnut were found to be quite effective in protecting wool fabric against black <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> [135].|$|R
50|$|Anthrenus flavipes is {{a species}} of beetle in the family Dermestidae known by the common name {{furniture}} <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle.</b> It has a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring throughout the world, being most active in warmer climates. It is a pest that damages household materials such as textiles.|$|R
30|$|Although some 32000 traps were placed, a {{substantial}} proportion were lost or damaged. More than 500 traps were listed as missing, damaged or unreadable, {{and so were}} removed from the dataset before analysis. This prevented confusion with traps which were examined, but free of any of the listed insects (Table  1). Some 54 % of the traps contained insects that were categorised and about 10 % of the traps had other observations such as trapped flies, presence of predators, frass etc. Table  1 shows booklice, silverfish and woodlice to be the most abundant. The woolly bear larvae (typically the larva of the varied <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle,</b> Anthrenus verbasci and the Guernsey <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle,</b> Anthrenus sarnicus) and clothes moths were also found frequently.|$|R
5000|$|Fabric pests: There are {{two groups}} of Fabric pests that are common in museums: <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> and clothes moths. These pest eat {{proteins}} like wool, fur, feathers, dead animals and horns. These pests are known to burrow into materials such as storage bins or little used drawers.|$|R
50|$|The black <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> (Attagenus unicolor) is a 3 - 5 mm beetle {{that can}} be a serious {{household}} pest.

50|$|The brown <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle,</b> Attagenus smirnovi, is a beetle {{from the}} Dermestidae family. It is a synanthropic pest which lives in human buildings, homes and museums and eats wool-textiles, carpets, skin and fur. Due to its {{specific}} epithet smirnovi, the beetle {{is also known}} in the United Kingdom as the 'Vodka beetle', after the Smirnoff brand of vodka.|$|R
50|$|Mildew, perspiration, and bleach {{can also}} damage the fabric, {{but it is}} {{resistant}} to moths and <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles.</b> Linen {{is relatively easy to}} take care of, since it resists dirt and stains, has no lint or pilling tendency, and can be dry-cleaned, machine-washed or steamed. It can withstand high temperatures, and has only moderate initial shrinkage.|$|R

50|$|Actual book-borers are uncommon. Two moths, {{the common}} clothes moth and the brown house moth, will attack cloth bindings. Leather-bound books attract various beetles, such as the larder beetle and the larva of the black <b>carpet</b> <b>beetle</b> and Stegobium paniceum. Larval death watch beetles and common {{furniture}} beetles will tunnel through wood and paper (if it is nearby the wood).|$|R
50|$|Signs {{that you}} have an {{infestation}} is spotting their pellets and skin. You should also expect to see the adult beetles and their larvae. Adult guernsey <b>carpet</b> <b>beetles</b> have patches of brown, white, and black. They move slowly and if you touch them they will roll over. Identify the source of the infestations by looking where there is more beetles, skins, and feces.|$|R
