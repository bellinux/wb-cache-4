5|$|Doppler {{redshift}} vs cosmological red-shift: Astronomersoften {{refer to}} the cosmological red-shift as a normal Doppler shift,which is a misconception. Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the Doppler redshift. The Doppler redshift is based on special relativity, which does not consider <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> space. On the contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which <b>the</b> <b>expansion</b> <b>of</b> space is considered. Although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler redshift.|$|E
