40|$|BACKGROUND: The PCA 3 <b>test</b> <b>on</b> urine {{can improve}} {{specificity}} in prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis and could prevent unnecessary prostate biopsies. In this study, we evaluated the PCA 3 <b>test</b> <b>on</b> prostatic fluid and compared {{this with the}} PCA 3 <b>test</b> <b>on</b> urine in a clinical research setting. METHODS: Prostatic fluid and urine samples from 67 men were collected following digital rectal examination (DRE). The sediments were analyzed using the quantitative APTIMA PCA 3 test. The results were compared with prostate biopsy results. RESULTS: Using a PCA 3 score of 66 as a cut-off value, the <b>test</b> <b>on</b> prostatic fluid had 65 % sensitivity {{for the detection of}} PCa, 82 % specificity and a negative predictive value of 82 %. At a cut-off value of 43, the <b>test</b> <b>on</b> urine had 61 % sensitivity, 80 % specificity and a negative predictive value of 80 %. CONCLUSIONS: The PCA 3 test can be performed on both urine and prostatic fluid in the diagnosis of PCa with comparable results...|$|R
