This paper proposes a control concept for designing the steering feel with a model based approach. The reference steering feel is defined in virtual dynamics for tracking. The layout of the reference model and the control architecture is discussed at first and then the decoupling of EPAS motor dynamics using a feedback control is shown. An example of how a change in steering feel reference (as desired by the driver) creates a change in steering feedback is further exhibited. The ultimate goal is to provide the driver with a tunable steering feel. For this, the verification is performed in simulation environment...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies suggest}} that a {{reduction}} of the plantar-flexion muscle EMG can improve the efficiency of human locomotion. In this study, an attempt is made to reduce the maximal EMG of the gastrocnemius medialis and soleus by providing a feed-forward <b>torque</b> <b>support</b> around the ankle. The strategy only requires the ankle kinematics to define the appropriate support torque. The maximal amount of support applied was equal to 30 % of the total ankle torque of a human during steady state walking. Five untrained subjects walked on a treadmill at 4 km/h and completed 3 test sessions of about 45 minutes each. The final EMG measurements showed a maximal reduction of 30 % for the soleus and a slight increase of the gastrocnemius medialis EMG pattern for the case where 50 % of the maximal support was applied. The tests showed {{a significant change in}} the ankle angle patterns when walking with maximal support. The findings suggest that the human prioritizes invariant ankle torque pattern over an invariant kinematic pattern. The results suggest that feed-forward torque control is capable to reduce the soleus muscle EMG and could possibly increase the walking efficiency of human locomotion.

Static tests were performed with the varying of support conditions from simply <b>supported,</b> pinned, and <b>torqued</b> bolts. The goal was to understand the change in strength and failure modes due to the joint under transverse loading. Optimization of the joint was also involved, thus the torque levels were also varied to conclude t he best torque level for performance of the joint. It was found out that the bolted joint improved the performance and strength of the DCCSS in comparison to the simply supported and pinned support conditions. The failure mode of the DCCSS changed with each support condition, but ultimate failure was consistently due to delamination between the adhesive interlayer and face sheet. The optimal torque level of 90 ft-lbs. was determined from static testing. The influence of fatigue on stiffness retention, residual strength and damage were also conducted for both pinned and <b>torqued</b> <b>support</b> conditions to study durability.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between isokinetic relative torques of hip, knee and ankle joints and the height of guide leg jump in young men. Methods: 27 college male athletes with mean age of 25 ± 3. 5 years, height 178. 5 ± 7. 8 cm and weight of 75. 7 ± 10. 7 kg voluntarily participated in this study. Isokinetic torque of hip, knee and ankle joints and the height of vertical jump were measured using BIODEX SYSTEM PRO 4 and digital vertical jumping tester systems respectively. Pearson correlation test at p< 0. 05 was used for statistical analysis. Results: Results showed that there were significant correlations between height of jump and hip joint flexion (p= 0. 047 & r= 0. 39) and extension (p= 0. 003 & r= 0. 55) torques of guide leg, hip joint extension <b>torque</b> of <b>support</b> leg (p= 0. 020 & r= 0. 45) and knee joint flexion (p= 0. 019 & r= 0. 45) and extension <b>torques</b> of <b>support</b> leg (p= 0. 006 & r= 0. 52).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{function}} of torques exerted by the joints of the lower trunk during maximal velocity sprinting. Eight male track and field athletes volunteered, and sprinted 60 m from a standing start position. The ground reaction force of the support leg was determined using a force platform (1000 Hz), which was placed at the 50 -m mark from the start position. Simultaneously, 3 D coordinates were recorded with a motion analysis system (250 Hz) using 20 cameras (MX-T 20). The joint torques were calculated using inverse dynamics. The contribution of joint torques to the right and left hip joint forces, and the torso joint force, was calculated by a method that simultaneously solves equations of motion for each segment and equations of constraint conditions for adjacent segments connected by a joint. The main results were as follows: (1) During the terminal support phase (80 - 100 % normalized time), the angular velocity of anterior rotation of the pelvis decreased and participants in whom this angular velocity decrease was diminished ran faster (p< 0. 10). (2) During terminal support, the hip joint adduction <b>torque</b> of the <b>support</b> leg and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint rotated the pelvis forward. The moment of the right and left hip joint forces rotated the pelvis backward. (3) During terminal support, the hip joint force of the support leg was generated by its hip joint flexion and adduction torque, the hip joint extension torque of the recovery leg, and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint. In contrast, the hip joint force of the recovery leg was generated by the hip joint flexion and adduction <b>torque</b> of the <b>support</b> leg, and the anterior rotation torque of the torso joint. (4) During terminal support, the hip joint flexion torque exerted by the support leg rotated the pelvis backward.

30|$|The most {{important}} feature {{is that the}} wire driven mechanism can achieve higher allowable torque density (allowable torque of reduction mechanism [Nm] / weight of reduction mechanism [kg]) comparing to other reduction mechanisms. In case of a gear reduction mechanism, the power can be reliably transmitted. However the output <b>torque</b> is <b>supported</b> by {{one or two of}} the gear teeth, and in order to output high torque, the module of the gear must be large or material of the gear need to have high yield strength which generally makes a mechanism heavy such as steel. The same is true in the case of a timing belt, which can transmit power to a separate axis just like wire. In the case of the wire driven mechanism, strength of wire that transmits torque between pulleys, limits allowable torque. On the side of pulley in which wire wound, since wire tension is attenuated along with winding onto the pulley surface, even plastic material can endure wire tension.|$|R
40|$|Background. Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} that older adults have a reduced ability to recover balance with a single step after a forward-induced fall. To better understand {{the reasons for this}} reduced ability, this study investigated any age-related differences in peak joint <b>torques</b> during the <b>support</b> phase of a single-step balance recovery from a forward fall. Methods. Ten young (19 – 23 years old) and 10 older (65 – 83 years old) men were released from forward-leaning positions and attempted to recover their balance with a single step. Lean was increased until they failed to recover their balance with a single step. Peak extensor torques were calculated for the support phase of balance recovery and were compared across age groups. Results. A consistent pattern of joint torques emerged during the support phase of balance recovery, suggesting a similar strategy across young and older participants. Despite this similarity, older participants exhibited smaller peak knee extensor <b>torques</b> during the <b>support</b> phase of single-step balance recoveries, and trends toward larger peak extensor torques at the hip and ankle.

In the presence of an angular rotation rate about the z-axis, a harmonic Coriolis force is induced on each proof mass. These force vectors lie in the tangential direction, generating a resultant <b>torque</b> on the <b>supporting</b> frame. The net Coriolis <b>torque</b> excites the <b>supporting</b> frame into torsional oscillation about the z-axis, which is capacitively detected to generate angular rate measurement. Two batches of prototypes have been fabricated using in-house single crystal silicon on insulator (SCS-SOI) bulk-micromachining and EFAB ™ process commercially available from Microfabrica. Wideband drive operation was demonstrated in SOI devices. EFAB process yielded 850 Hz devices with quality factor 250 in air (bandwidth 3 Hz) and 850 in vacuum.

While the first-year spindown of a newborn NS is most likely dominated by em processes, reasonable values of B_t and the (external) dipolar field B_d can lead to detectable levels of gw emission, for a newborn NS in our own galaxy...|$|R
