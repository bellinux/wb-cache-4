40|$|Industrial {{longline}} fisheries {{cause the}} death {{of large numbers of}} seabirds annually. Various mitigation measures have been proposed, including the use of tori lines. In this study the efficiency of a single tori line to reduce seabird bycatch was tested on pelagic longline vessels (25 - 37 m length). Thirteen fishing trips were carried out in the area and season of the highest bycatch rates recorded in the southwest Atlantic (2009 - 2011). We deployed two treatments in random order: sets with a tori line and without a tori line (control treatment). The use of a tori line significantly reduced seabird bycatch rates. Forty three and seven birds were captured in the control (0. 85 birds/ 1, 000 hooks, n = 49 sets) and in the tori line treatment (0. 13 birds/ 1, 000 hooks, n = 51 sets), respectively. In 47 % of the latter sets the tori line broke either because of entanglement with the longline gear or by tension. This diminished the tori line effectiveness; five of the seven captures during sets where a tori line was deployed were following ruptures. Nine additional trips were conducted with a tori line that was modified to reduce entanglements (2012 - 2016). Seven entanglements were recorded in 73 longline sets. The chance of a rupture on these trips was 4 % (95 % c. l. = 1 - 18 %) of that during 2009 - 2011. This work shows that the use of a tori line reduces seabird bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries and is a practice suitable for medium size vessels (~ 25 - 40 m length). Because the study area has historically very high bycatch rates at global level, this <b>tori</b> <b>line</b> <b>design</b> is potentially useful to reduce seabird bycatch in many medium size pelagic longline vessel fishing in the southern hemisphere...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Seabird bycatch in {{commercial}} fisheries {{is one of}} the major factors causing decreases in many seabird populations. In trawl fisheries, high mortalities have been recorded as a result of seabirds being struck by trawl warps (the cables used to tow the trawl net). <b>Tori</b> (bird-scaring) <b>lines</b> have been used to decrease seabird mortality in some trawl fisheries by up to 90 %. However, <b>tori</b> <b>lines</b> are not effective at reducing the number of birds that drift towards the trawl warps while feeding on factory discards alongside the vessel. The Albatross Task Force (ATF) helped to develop and test a new device, the Rory Line (RL), to be used in conjunction with <b>tori</b> <b>lines,</b> and <b>designed</b> to reduce warp strikes by placing a physical barrier between the scupper (where factory discards are released) and the danger zone (where the trawl warps enter the water) at the stern of the vessel. This study tests the efficacy of the RL at reducing the number of birds drifting into the danger zone and the number of birds being struck by the trawl warps...|$|R

Based on an established significant relationship between contact rate and seabird mortality, when using contact rate as an index of mortality {{there was a clear}} performance hierarchy of the three measures. <b>Tori</b> <b>lines</b> and the warp scarer were significantly more effective at reducing contacts than the Brady Baffler, whilst <b>tori</b> <b>lines</b> represent a smaller, but still significant, improvement on the warp scarer.

[...] The WPRFMC's {{response to the}} volume of seabirds being caught was to mount a project through 1998 and 1999 to test various seabird mitigation methods. It was found that during gear setting operations, blue dyed baits were the most successful mitigation method, followed by strategic offal discards. <b>Tori</b> <b>lines</b> and a towed buoy system also proved to be effective mitigation measures during the set.

40|$|The common {{approach}} to balancing mixed-model assembly lines {{assumes that the}} line operators are well trained and that the learning effect is negligible. The assumption is that the line operates in steady state {{over a long period}} of time.

40|$|Product <b>line</b> <b>design</b> is {{commonly}} used to provide higher product variety for satisfying diversified customer needs. To reduce the cost and development time and improve quality of products, companies quite often consider sourcing. Conventionally, product <b>line</b> <b>design</b> and supplier selection are dealt with separately. Some previous studies have been attempted to consider product <b>line</b> <b>design</b> and supplier selection simultaneously but two shortcomings were noted. First, the previous studies considered several objectives as a single objective function {{in the formulation of}} optimization models for the integrated problem. Second, positions of product variants to be offered in a product line in competitive markets are not clearly defined that would affect the formulation of marketing strategies for the product line. In this paper, a methodology for integrated product <b>line</b> <b>design</b> and supplier selection is proposed to address the shortcomings in which a multi-objective optimization model is formulated to determine their specifications and select suppliers for maximizing the profit, quality and performance as well as minimizing the cost of the product line. In addition, joint-spacing mapping is introduced to help estimate market share of products and indicate positions of product variants. The proposed methodology can provide decision makers with a better tradeoff among various objectives of product <b>line</b> <b>design,</b> and define market positions of product variants explicitly. The results generated based on the methodology could help companies develop product lines with higher profits, better product quality and larger market share to be obtained. A case study of a product <b>line</b> <b>design</b> of notebook computers was performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The results have shown that Pareto optimal product <b>line</b> <b>designs</b> and the specifications of product variants can be determined. Suppliers of components and modules can be selected with considerations of minimum sourcing cost, and maximum performance and quality of product variants. Prices and positions of the product variants can also be determined. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
