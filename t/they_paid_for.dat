The club broke the British transfer record again in 1981 with the £1.5million signing of Bryan Robson from West Bromwich Albion. When Andy Cole signed for United in January 1995, the club paid £7million, almost double their previous record of £3.75million, which <b>they</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> Roy Keane 18 months earlier.

25|$|By 1912, the Post Office had {{received}} numerous complaints from postmasters that the many near-identical Washington stamps {{in the issue}} confused postal clerks, too often leading them to give customers higher denominations than <b>they</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for.</b> The Post Office addressed this problem in the series of 1912–14 by making {{a significant change in}} the line up in the Washington-Franklin denominations. Washington would now appear on the lower values only; all denominations of 8c and higher would display the Franklin-head. The realignment provided a clear visual distinction between the cheaper and the more expensive stamps. To further heighten the distinction, the Post Office now introduced the oak-leaf frame for the Franklin stamps, thus eliminating olive branches from the higher values along with Washington.|$|E

Penalties for violating the ban increased under the 'Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010'. However, small allowances for personal possession are permitted {{as long as the}} possessor can prove that they have paid import duties. In January 2016, Turkmenistan president Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov reportedly banned all tobacco sales in the country. The Pitcairn Islands had previously banned the sale of cigarettes; however, it now permits sales from a government-run store. The Pacific island of Niue hopes to become the next country to prohibit the sale of tobacco. A proposal in Iceland would ban tobacco sales from shops, making it prescription-only and therefore dispensable only in pharmacies on doctor's orders. New Zealand hopes to achieve being tobacco-free by 2025 and Finland by 2040. In 2012, anti-smoking groups proposed a 'smoking licence' – if a smoker managed to quit and hand back their licence, they would get back any money <b>they</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it. Medical students in Singapore and the Australian state of Tasmania have proposed a 'tobacco free millennium generation initiative' by banning the sale of all tobacco products to anyone born in and after the year 2000.|$|E

25|$|Corporate insolvencies {{happen because}} {{companies}} become excessively indebted. Under UK law, {{a company is}} a separate legal person {{from the people who}} have invested money and labour into it, and it mediates a series of interest groups. Invariably the shareholders, directors and employees' liability is limited to the amount of their investment, so against commercial creditors they can lose no more than the money <b>they</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> shares, or their jobs. Insolvencies become intrinsically possible whenever a relationship of credit and debt is created, as frequently happens through contracts or other obligations. In the section of an economy where competitive markets operate, wherever excesses are possible, insolvencies are likely to happen. The meaning of insolvency is simply an inability to repay debts, although the law isolates two main further meanings. First, for a court to order a company be wound up (and its assets sold off) or for an administrator to be appointed (to try to turn the business around), or for avoiding various transactions, the cash flow test is usually applied: a company must be unable to pay its debts as they fall due. Second, for the purpose of suing directors to compensate creditors, or for directors to be disqualified, a company must be shown to have fewer overall assets than liabilities on its balance sheet. If debts cannot be paid back to everybody in full, creditors necessarily stand in competition with one another for a share of the remaining assets. For this reason, a statutory system of priorities fixes the order among different kinds of creditor for payment.|$|E

[...] To counter this Henrys undertook a reorganisation of his forces, forming three military districts centred on Fez, Meknes and Tadla-Zaian (the Khénifra region), the latter under the command of Garnier-Duplessix. [...] Henrys aimed to maintain pressure on Hammou through an economic blockade and the closure of markets to unsubmitted tribes. [...] He imposed a war penalty, in the form of money, horses and rifles, on submitting tribes, believing that their submission would last only if <b>they</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> it.

Like all her family and friends, Morisi was illiterate. She {{had come to the}} city, {{following}} her three sisters, to work and save money towards a dowry so she could eventually marry. In early 1855, Morisi became pregnant, as was not uncommon for unmarried servants in Bologna at this time. Many employers would simply sack girls in such situations, but the Mortaras did not; <b>they</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> Morisi to spend the last four months of her pregnancy at a midwife's home and deliver the child, then had her return to work with them. To protect Morisi and themselves from embarrassment, they told neighbours that their maid was sick and recuperating at home. Morisi gave her newborn baby to an orphanage, as the Papal States required unwed mothers to do, then returned to work with the Mortaras. She remained there until she was hired by another Bologna family in 1857; soon after that she married and moved back to San Giovanni in Persiceto.|$|E
500|$|The {{monetary}} issue {{played a}} large role in selecting the nominees in 1880, but had little effect on the general election campaign. The debate concerned the basis for the United States dollar's value. Nothing but gold and silver coin had ever been legal tender in the United States until the Civil War, when the mounting costs of the war forced Congress to issue [...] "greenbacks" [...] (dollar bills backed by government bonds). <b>They</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> the war, but resulted in the most severe inflation since the American Revolution. [...] After the war, bondholders and other creditors (especially in the North) wanted to return to a gold standard. At the same time, debtors (often in the South and West) benefited by the way inflation reduced their debts, and workers and some businessmen liked the way inflation made for easy credit. The issue cut across parties, producing dissension among Republicans and Democrats alike and spawning a third party, the Greenback Party, in 1876, when both major parties nominated hard money men. [...] Monetary debate intensified as Congress effectively demonetized silver in 1873 and began redeeming greenbacks in gold by 1879, while limiting their circulation. [...] By the 1880 convention, the nation's money was backed by gold alone, but the issue was far from settled.|$|E
500|$|Given {{the amount}} of debt on Manchester United's books at the time, some analysts {{estimated}} in 2010 that any takeover bid {{would have had to}} total more than £2billion, of which around £1.6billion would be needed to match the Glazers' valuation of the club – double what <b>they</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> the club in 2005. However, the Red Knights publicly stated that they would only pay [...] "a fair price" [...] when their takeover bid finally came. On 11 March 2010, the Red Knights appointed Nomura Securities Co. as their advisers for their takeover bid. Nomura previously advised the Manchester United board before the Glazers' bid to buy the club. The Red Knights later admitted that they would not make a bid for the club {{before the end of the}} 2009–10 season, but it was believed that their preferred bid option would have involved retaining the £500million bond issued by the Glazers. Two-thirds of a further £700million would be provided by 30–40 wealthy Manchester United fans, with the remainder provided by fund-raising from ordinary fans. Once the club was secured, shares would then be offered to fans, allowing them to take ownership of the club. Despite these plans, the Red Knights put their takeover bid [...] "on hold" [...] in June 2010, citing [...] "inflated valuation aspirations" [...] in the media as the reason. Having already stated that they would only pay a [...] "sensible" [...] amount for the club, the group was thought to have baulked at the suggestion that the Glazers' valuation of the club was significantly higher than the amount they were willing to pay.|$|E

[...] The District Court, however issued a summary judgement for the government against the contention that feral horses who ate grass or drank water on privately owned lands had [...] "taken" [...] these resources from the ranchers in violation of the [...] "takings clause" [...] of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the government must compensate the private landowners $500,000. [...] The foundation appealed the summary judgement to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. In Mountain States Legal Foundation v. Hodel, 799 F.2d 1423 (1986), cert. den'd. 480 U.S. 951 (1987), the appeals court remanded the summary judgement back to the district court, which ultimately ruled that a wild animal was not an [...] "agent" [...] of the federal government and hence could not be found guilty of [...] "taking" [...] the ranchers' grass or water. [...] However, in 2000, the [...] "takings" [...] argument was brought up again, this time in Bradshaw v. United States U.S. Court of Federal Claims 47 Fed.Cl. 549 (Sept. 15, 2000) wherein the plaintiffs held that free-roaming horses were taking forage that <b>they</b> <b>paid</b> <b>for</b> with their grazing permit, and the horses were drinking water from springs for which they owned the water rights.
