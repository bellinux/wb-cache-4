5|$|Pam apologizes <b>to</b> <b>Jim</b> that Roy {{attacked}} him but her assurance that {{her relationship with}} Roy is over for good is met with polite skepticism.

Their meeting at a local diner is awkward and ends with their relationship (and even friendship) appearing to be over; they hug and Pam wipes a tear from her face. Roy encourages Pam to pursue her feelings for Jim {{but she says she}} will not try to get him. Roy does not understand his long-time fiancée, especially her choice to not pursue Jim.|$|E

A man of eclectic tastes, Baker cited as literary influences writers and film directors ranging from Proust <b>to</b> <b>Jim</b> Thompson and Sam Peckinpah. He also admired the punk writer Dennis Cooper.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Jim</b> Gaines, {{director}} of the Jesse H. Jones Center for Economic and Demographic Forecasting at Rice Center, a Rice University-affiliated urban research center, {{the development of these}} apartment complexes was not well planned or coordinated. There was often little interest in building a quality product as developers were primarily concerned with generating quick revenue and capitalizing on the deregulation of financial institutions, tax laws favoring apartment construction, inflation, and a housing shortage in the Houston metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|After five {{consecutive}} seasons finishing {{bottom of the}} Scottish Football League in the mid-2000s, Jim McInally also changed fortunes at the club, managing East Stirlingshire to successive third-place finishes in the Third Division between 2008 and 2010 {{to qualify for the}} promotion play-offs.

60|$|Swift {{words of}} {{explanation}} rose <b>to</b> <b>Jim's</b> lips, but they paused there and died. At that last moment he could not, as Margery's husband, announce Margery's shame and his own, and transform her father's triumph to wretchedness at a blow.|$|R

In 1879, the LDS Church bought the ferry and transferred its operation to Warren Marshall Johnson and his family.

5|$|Bradman {{was given}} another life at 108 when he {{advanced}} two metres down the pitch <b>to</b> <b>Jim</b> Laker and missed, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity. Australia reached tea at 1/292 having added 171 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed for 182, having partnered Bradman in {{a stand of}} 301 in 217 minutes. This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required. He struck two boundaries and helped take the score to 396 before falling with eight runs still needed. Harvey came in and got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs. This sealed an Australian victory by seven wickets, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase, with Bradman unbeaten on 173 with 29 fours in only 255 minutes.|$|E
