In July 1968, he was assigned as deputy for systems management and in November 1969 as the systems program director of the B-1 Lancer program.

25|$|In 1998, he was {{selected}} as the operations officer for the 410th Flight Test Squadron and performed developmental flight testing of the F-117 Nighthawk. From 2000 to 2003, he served as the vice commandant for the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School. He was responsible for the day-to-day operations of all aspects of the school and also mentored students as a full-time flight instructor. After retiring from the Air Force in 2003, he was hired by Lockheed Martin as the F-117 chief test pilot. In September 2007, he transitioned to the F-22 Combined <b>Test</b> <b>Force</b> (CTF) at Edwards Air Force Base. During this time, Cooley and his family lived in Lancaster, California.|$|E

While a member of the 3247th Test Squadron, Lindsey served as the Deputy Director, Advanced Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance System Joint <b>Test</b> <b>Force</b> and as the squadron’s F-16 Flight Commander. In August 1993, he was selected to attend Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. Upon graduation in June 1994, he was reassigned to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, as an Integrated Product Team leader in the USAF SEEK EAGLE Office where he was responsible for Air Force weapons certification for the F-16, F-111, A-10, and F-117 aircraft.

30|$|The {{significant}} correlations of volume BMD, BV/TV, and SMI {{with the two}} conventional <b>test</b> <b>forces</b> observed {{in this study are}} in agreement with those reported in previous studies using a cadaveric femoral head [37, 38]. SMI {{is a measure of the}} relative number of rod- and plate-like trabecular structures, with values ranging from 0 (plate-like structure) to 3 (rod-like structure), with values between 0 and 3 representing a mixture of plates and rods [31, 32, 40]. These results indicate that a plate-like bone structure with high BMD or BV exhibits high <b>test</b> <b>forces,</b> as reported in a previous study [17]. Among the volume BMD and micro-architectural parameters in this study, BS/TV was the parameter that best predicted the two <b>test</b> <b>forces</b> by itself. The BS/TV value rises when the bone quality improves with high BMD.|$|R

30|$|The {{present study}} found that peak torque and {{pull-out}} force had the strongest correlations with BS/TV and that the ISQ value had the strongest correlation with NNd/TV on micro-CT and MSCT. Our findings indicate that <b>test</b> <b>forces,</b> including the ISQ value, can be predicted by CT parameters on both micro-CT and MSCT. Many trials have evaluated the stability of orthopedic implants (i.e., insertion torque and pull-out force) [9, 15, 17, 33 – 35]. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} study to predict these <b>test</b> <b>forces</b> with micro-architectural parameters in the field of spinal surgery.|$|R

The stroke at 0  N <b>testing</b> <b>force</b> can be extrapolated using the slope of the stroke increment and the <b>testing</b> <b>force</b> curve.
