It was named after Bruce Coulter, long-time Head Coach at Bishop's University and former offensive and defensive player with the Montreal Alouettes in the 1950s. Coulter was inducted as a builder in the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1997.|$|E

5|$|The name Bruce Castle {{is derived}} from the House of Bruce, who had {{historically}} owned a third of the manor of Tottenham. However, there was no castle in the area, and {{it is unlikely that the}} family lived nearby. Upon his accession to the Scottish throne in 1306, Robert I of Scotland forfeited his lands in England, including <b>the</b> <b>Bruce</b> holdings in Tottenham, ending the connection between <b>the</b> <b>Bruce</b> family and the area. The former Bruce land in Tottenham was granted to Richard Spigurnell and Thomas Hethe.|$|E

5|$|However, {{war with}} England {{continued}} {{for several decades}} {{after the death of}} Bruce. A civil war between <b>the</b> <b>Bruce</b> dynasty and their long-term Comyn-Balliol rivals lasted until the middle of the 14th century. Although <b>the</b> <b>Bruce</b> dynasty was successful, David II's lack of an heir allowed his half-nephew Robert II to come to the throne and establish the Stewart Dynasty. The Stewarts ruled Scotland {{for the remainder of the}} Middle Ages. The country they ruled experienced greater prosperity from the end of the 14th century through the Scottish Renaissance to the Reformation. This was despite continual warfare with England, the increasing division between Highlands and Lowlands, and a large number of royal minorities.|$|E
5|$|In real life, 'Steward' {{eventually}} became the name 'Stewart' (later changed to French 'Stuart'), and Walter Stewart married Princess Marjorie, daughter of Robert <b>the</b> <b>Bruce.</b> Their son, Robert II, began the Stewart/Stuart line of kings in Scotland. James VI and I, son of Mary, Queen of Scots, was the ninth Stewart/Stuart monarch (eighth king) of Scotland {{and the first}} of the Stuart monarchs of England and Ireland.|$|E

5|$|On 14 October 1322, the English {{army was}} routed by the Scots, {{under the command}} of Robert <b>the</b> <b>Bruce,</b> at the Battle of Old Byland in Yorkshire. The English commander, John of Brittany, Earl of Richmond, was taken prisoner, while the king himself barely escaped capture. It was the worst defeat the English had {{suffered}} in the wars since the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Harclay had received a summons to join the royal army, but {{had not been able to}} bring his troops south in time to come to the king's rescue. The event convinced him that the war against Scotland could not be won under the leadership of the present king. Instead he entered into direct negotiations with the Scots, without the king's sanction. On 3 January 1323, he signed a peace treaty with Robert <b>the</b> <b>Bruce</b> at Lochmaben.|$|E
5|$|Robert II (2 March 1316 – 19 April 1390) reigned as King of Scots from 1371 to {{his death}} as the first monarch of the House of Stewart.

5|$|As it {{approaches}} {{the southern end}} of <b>the</b> <b>Bruce</b> Peninsula, the route bisects Port Elgin, then curves abruptly towards Lake Huron and passes through Southampton before curving to the east towards Owen Sound. Between those two places, the highway is generally straight, except at the boundary between Bruce and Grey Counties as well as the descent of the Niagara Escarpment at Springmount. Several communities line this inland stretch of highway, including Chippewa Hill, Kelly's Corners, Elsinore, Allenford, Alvanley and Jackson. At Springmount, the route encounters Highway 6, which joins Highway21 to form Ontario's only wrong-way concurrency east to Owen Sound.|$|E

Marjorie's son Robert <b>the</b> <b>Bruce,</b> through military success and ancestral kinship with the Dunkeld dynasty, became King of Scots. King Robert's brother, Edward Bruce, became for a short time High King of Ireland.|$|E

Wallace was defeated at the Battle of Falkirk, after which Robert <b>the</b> <b>Bruce</b> rebelled and was crowned king of Scotland. Edward died while travelling to Scotland for another campaign.|$|E
