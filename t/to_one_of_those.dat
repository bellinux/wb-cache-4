25|$|Frequency {{multiplication}} {{can also}} be attained by locking the VCO output to the Nth harmonic of the reference signal. Instead of a simple phase detector, the design uses a harmonic mixer (sampling mixer). The harmonic mixer turns the reference signal into an impulse train that is rich in harmonics. The VCO output is coarse tuned to be close <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> harmonics. Consequently, the desired harmonic mixer output (representing {{the difference between the}} N harmonic and the VCO output) falls within the loop filter passband.|$|E
25|$|In {{birefringent}} media {{there is}} no attenuation but two modes accrue a differential phase delay. Well known manifestations of linear birefringence (that is, in which the basis polarizations are orthogonal linear polarizations) appear in optical wave plates/retarders and many crystals. If linearly polarized light passes through a birefringent material, its state of polarization will generally change unless its polarization direction is identical <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> basis polarizations. Since the phase shift, and thus the change in polarization state, is usually wavelength dependent, such objects viewed under white light in between two polarizers may give rise to colorful effects, {{as seen in the}} accompanying photograph.|$|E

During this period, Harper spent considerable {{time in the}} United States and signed with the US division of Chrysalis Records, who released HQ under a different title – When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease – and with alternative artwork. Chrysalis considered the original Hipgnosis-designed album cover of Harper walking on water to be too offensive for an American release. Harper disagreed, but was given no choice by the label. Chrysalis also changed the title of Harper's next album, Bullinamingvase, <b>to</b> <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>Those</b> Days in England.

500|$|The episode can be {{understood}} {{as a part of the}} tradition of Christmas ghost stories, which includes the works of Charles Dickens and the BBC's A Ghost Story for Christmas series. The inspiration for the use of the Krampus myth came from Pemberton's reading, while stylistic influence, according to Pemberton, came from [...] "old '70s style" [...] episodes of Beasts, Thriller and Tales of the Unexpected. Shearsmith named Thriller and Armchair Theatre as key inspirations; his intention with the episode was to [...] "go the whole hog and make a programme that was as near <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> original episodes as it's possible to get". The writing and acting thus differed from those of a typical 2010s television programme, with a script heavily utilising hyperbole and actors hamming. For Pemberton, the 1970s style of the episode was a literal representation of what, metaphorically speaking, Inside No. 9 had been doing since the first series.|$|E

In 1976, he acknowledged publicly that he had received an [...] "attractive offer" [...] to move the franchise to Phoenix, Arizona. Then, in 1977, he said, [...] "I like Baltimore and want to stay there, but {{when are we going to}} find out something about our stadium? I'm getting offers from towns like Indianapolis to build me a new stadium and give me other inducements to move there. I dont want to but I'd like to see some action in Baltimore." [...] In 1979, Hoffberger sold the Orioles to Washington D.C. attorney Edward Bennett Williams, who declared 1980 to be a trial year for the fans of Baltimore. He then went on to explain his concerns with Memorial Stadium, saying it had [...] "inadequate parking and inadequate access and egress. Frankly, I don't know if those problems will ever be solvable at that location." [...] Irsay began shopping the Colts around in earnest, talking first to officials from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, Memphis, Tennessee, and Jacksonville, Florida where he visited the Gator Bowl packed with 50,000 cheering fans trying to convince him that Jacksonville would be the best home for the Colts. That same year Irsay presented Maryland's Governor Harry Hughes with a request for $25 million in renovation to the 64,124 seat Memorial Stadium. Irsay's request for $25 million in improvements was decreased to $23 million by the Maryland legislature. The plan added more seats (but none of the revenue-generating skyboxes), improving the plumbing and would have given both teams better office space. The plan's approval was contingent on both the Colts and Baltimore Orioles signing long term leases. The Orioles challenged the requested football improvements and refused to sign anything more than a one-year lease. Irsay also refused to sign long term. As a result, the funds and improvements never came.|$|E
