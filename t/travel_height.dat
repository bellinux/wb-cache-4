5000|$|Statistically speaking, cable-borne {{elevators}} {{are extremely}} safe. Their safety record is unsurpassed {{by any other}} vehicle system. In 1998, {{it was estimated that}} approximately eight millionths of one percent (1 in 12 million) of elevator rides result in an anomaly, {{and the vast majority of}} these were minor things such as the doors failing to open. Of the 20 to 30 elevator-related deaths each year, most of them are maintenance-related — for example, technicians leaning too far into the shaft or getting caught between moving parts, and most of the rest are attributed to other kinds of accidents, such as people stepping blindly through doors that open into empty shafts or being strangled by scarves caught in the doors. In fact, prior to the September 11th terrorist attacks, the only known free-fall incident in a modern cable-borne elevator happened in 1945 when a B-25 bomber struck the Empire State Building in fog, severing the cables of an elevator cab, which fell from the 75th floor all the way to the bottom of the building, seriously injuring (though not killing) the sole occupant — the elevator operator. However, there was an incident in 2007 at a Seattle children's hospital, where a ThyssenKrupp ISIS machine-room-less elevator free-fell until the safety brakes were engaged. This was due to a flaw in the design where the cables were connected at one common point, and the kevlar ropes had a tendency to overheat and cause slipping (or, in this case, a free-fall). While it is possible (though extraordinarily unlikely) for an elevator's cable to snap, all elevators in the modern era have been fitted with several safety devices which prevent the elevator from simply free-falling and crashing. An elevator cab is typically borne by 2 to 6 (up to 12 or more in high rise installations) hoist cables or belts, each of which is capable on its own of supporting the full load of the elevator plus twenty-five percent more weight. In addition, there is a device which detects whether the elevator is descending faster than its maximum designed speed; if this happens, the device causes copper (or silicon nitride in high rise installations) brake shoes to clamp down along the vertical rails in the shaft, stopping the elevator quickly, but not so abruptly as to cause injury. This device is called the governor, and was invented by Elisha Graves Otis. In addition, an oil/hydraulic or spring or polyurethane or telescopic oil/hydraulic buffer or a combination (depending on the <b>travel</b> <b>height</b> and travel speed) is installed at the bottom of the shaft (or in the bottom of the cab and sometimes also in the top of the cab or shaft) to somewhat cushion any impact. However, In Thailand, in November 2012, a woman was killed in free falling elevator, in what was reported as the [...] "first legally recognised death caused by a falling lift".|$|E

40|$|We {{validated}} {{and established}} an automated method for PCR and capillary electrophoresis setup (CE setup), using the Tecan Freedom EVO® 150 and 75 automated liquid handling workstations powered by Freedom EVOware®. The PCR setup script of the Freedom EVO® 150 {{was based on}} the HID EVOlution™ System. However, substantial changes in the HID script were required before putting the system on stream in the routine. The CE setup of the Freedom EVO® 75 was based on a script made by application specialists of Tecan. For internal validation of the two robots, we investigated repeatability, reproducibility and occurrence of contaminations. The analysis of the reproducibility data demonstrated that electropherograms of samples pipetted by the robots had a lower mean size standard peak height, than the hand-pipetted samples, whereas the mean sample peak height did not differ between the two methods. This was mainly due to precision-differences between the robots and the hand-pipetting. The investigation of the occurrence of contaminations showed that with the PCR setup robot no sample got contaminated. The CE setup robot on the contrary revealed carryovers of samples from one well to the subsequent well. After intense examination, we discovered that the tip <b>travel</b> <b>height</b> was set too low, causing the tip to touch the rim of the 96 well plate which led to the carryovers. The contact between rim and tip could not be seen by naked eye, but after increasing the tip <b>travel</b> <b>height,</b> no further contamination was observed. Our validation demonstrates that robots, even when set up by application specialists, need to undergo a proper internal validation before being put on stream in the routine...|$|E

30|$|For impact speeds around 40 cm/s, {{we measure}} {{coefficients}} of restitution around 0.02 (see Fig.  8). This would set vr to 8 mm/s. Reduced-gravity environments had gravity levels around 10 − 2 g; thus, gl∼ 0.1 m/s 2. This {{leads to a}} travel time of t 0 = 80 ms and a rebound <b>travel</b> <b>height</b> of h = 320 μm. During the PRIME- 3 campaign, the camera resolution was around 80 μm/pixel and the recording was performed at 120 fps (about 8 ms between frames). In addition, reduced-gravity environments during this campaign lead to short parabolic trajectories of the ejected particles consistent with a ∼[*] 0.05 g acceleration environment, leaving {{a clear view of}} the projectile during the entire recording. This means that a rebound would have been observed and a rebound motion could have been measured for 10 frames and over 4 pixels. As no rebound was observed, it appears that they were due to a different behavior of the target and no rebound actually took place in reduced gravity. To illustrate this, we show two PRIME- 3 impacts with different outcomes in Fig.  11 c and their measured projectile positions, at deepest penetration (t 0) and after 22 (no rebound) and 4 (rebound) frames. Some impacts generating few ejecta allow for a long-term tracking of the projectile after the impact, allowing for the detection of rebound speeds as low as a few millimeters per second. However, large ejecta blankets obstruct the view of the projectile (see Fig.  11 a), thus limiting the observation of very low rebound speeds in these cases.|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{is growing}} in urban areas of every size {{and is expected to}} double by 2010. A relatively unexplored but very promising {{solution to the problem of}} congestion is the adoption of narrow vehicles for commuter travel. Narrow vehicles like motorcycles can promote significantly improved highway utilization by the use of half-width lanes. However, in order for the general public to adopt this form of personal transportation, narrow vehicles should perceptibly provide the same ease of use and the same level of safety as passenger sedans. The research team in this project has developed a new concept vehicle that is relatively tall compared to its track width so as to provide a <b>travel</b> <b>height</b> that is comparable to that of other vehicles on the highway. To help the driver balance a relatively tall, narrow vehicle, it incorporates an electronic tilt control system that ensures tilt stability. The tilt control system balances the vehicle and improves ease of use, especially on curves where the vehicle must lean into the curve to ensure tilt stability. In this report the design and implementation of a control system that ensures the tilt stability of the prototype narrow vehicle is presented. The control system is based on the use of steer-by-wire technology and is called Steering Tilt Control (STC). The report includes significant details on the design of the prototype narrow vehicle constructed by the research team, on dynamic modeling for narrow tilting vehicles and also includes experimental results on the performance of the control system on the prototype narrow vehicle.

40|$|We present new 3 D {{magnetohydrodynamic}} (MHD) {{simulations of}} a supernova-driven, stratified interstellar medium. These simulations were run using the Waagan (2009) positivity preserving scheme for ideal MHD {{implemented in the}} Flash code. The scheme is stable even for the Mach numbers approaching 100 found in this problem. We have previously shown that the density distribution arising from hydrodynamical versions of these simulations creates low-density pathways through which Lyman continuum photons can <b>travel</b> to <b>heights</b> |z| > 1 kpc.
