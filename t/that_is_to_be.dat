5|$|Open circuit scuba divers by {{definition}} {{are independent of}} surface supply, and must take any gas mixture with them <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used on the dive. However, if they are confident of returning by a specific route, the decompression gas may be stored at appropriate places on that route. The cylinders {{used for this purpose}} are called stage cylinders, and they are usually provided with a standard regulator and a submersible pressure gauge, and are usually left at the stop with the regulator pressurized, but the cylinder valve turned off to minimize the risk of gas loss. Similar cylinders are carried by the divers when the route back is not secure. They are commonly mounted as sling cylinders, clipped to D-rings at the sides of the diver's harness.|$|E

25|$|Babin et al. {{carried out}} some of the {{earliest}} investigations into shopper motivations and identified two broad motives: utilitarian and hedonic.

On the other hand, hedonic motives refer to pleasure. The shopper with hedonic motivations views shopping as a form of escapism where they are free to indulge fantasy and freedom. Hedonic shoppers are more involved in the shopping experience.|$|E

This material is vaporized from the target (in a plasma plume) which deposits it as a thin film on a substrate (such as a silicon wafer facing the target). This process can occur in ultra high vacuum or {{in the presence of}} a background gas, such as oxygen which is commonly used when depositing oxides to fully oxygenate the deposited films.|$|E

Plans included anti-erosion measures and extensive replanting in the hardest hit prefectures of Arcadia, Achaea, Elis, Corinthia, Laconia, Messenia, and Euboea.

These bushes and saplings will include laurel bushes, oaks, olive trees, and other indigenous species.|$|E
