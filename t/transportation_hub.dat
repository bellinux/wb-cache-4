5|$|The Battle of Taejon (14–21 July 1950) was {{an early}} battle of the Korean War, between American and North Korean forces.

The 24th Infantry Division was overwhelmed by numerically superior forces of the Korean People's Army (KPA) at the major city and <b>transportation</b> <b>hub</b> of Taejon.

5|$|Further {{economic}} success {{continued through the}} 1980s, with the unemployment rate falling to 3% and real GDP growth averaging at about 8% up until 1999. During the 1980s, Singapore began to upgrade to higher-technological industries, such as the wafer fabrication sector, in order to compete with its neighbours which now had cheaper labour. Singapore Changi Airport was opened in 1981 and Singapore Airlines was developed to become a major airline. The Port of Singapore {{became one of the}} world's busiest ports and the service and tourism industries also grew immensely during this period. Singapore emerged as an important <b>transportation</b> <b>hub</b> and a major tourist destination.|$|E
5|$|On July 12, Dean {{ordered the}} division's three regiments—the US 19th, 21st and 34th Infantry Regiments—to cross the Kum River, {{destroying}} all bridges behind them, {{and to establish}} defensive positions around Taejon. Dean formed a line with the 34th Infantry and 19th Infantry facing east, and held the heavily battered 21st Infantry in reserve to the southeast. Taejon stood as a major <b>transportation</b> <b>hub</b> between Seoul and Taegu, giving it great strategic value for both sides. The division was attempting to make a stand at Taejon, the last place it could conduct a delaying action before the North Korean forces could converge on the unfinished Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|Potiorek {{planned to}} launch a {{converging}} attack across northern and western Serbia; the 5th Army was to capture Valjevo and envelope the Kolubara River from the north, and the 6th Army was to secure the Jagodnja plateau and outflank Serbian units on the Kolubara from the south. The capture of the southeastern Serbian city of Niš was Potiorek's main objective; Niš had been Serbia's capital since July and was a crucial <b>transportation</b> <b>hub</b> for its military. It also acted as a clearing house for munitions produced at the arsenal in nearby Kragujevac. The city's capture would effectively cut Serbia in two and scatter the Serbian Army.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} rapid {{industrial}} growth that began in Indiana during the gas boom of the late 19th-century, labor unions began to form with goals of increasing wages and providing other benefits to workers through collective bargaining. The Indianapolis Traction and Terminal Company was founded to own and operate the streetcar terminal in downtown Indianapolis, and operate the Indianapolis Street Railway under a lease agreement for a term of 31 years. In 1892 the employees of Indianapolis Traction and Terminal Company launched a short-lived strike. The company was the primary public transportation provider in Indianapolis and operated the central <b>transportation</b> <b>hub</b> {{for the city of}} Indianapolis and state of Indiana. The company offered small concessions, and the workers returned to work without unionizing.|$|E

After the war, Indianapolis continued to develop into a <b>transportation</b> <b>hub.</b> Existing railroad lines expanded and new ones were established, linking Indianapolis to other cities across the nation.|$|E
