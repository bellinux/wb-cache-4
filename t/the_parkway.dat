5|$|At its {{southern}} end {{near the mouth}} of the Don River, <b>the</b> <b>parkway</b> begins in a multiple-level interchange with the ground-level Lake Shore Boulevard and the elevated Gardiner Expressway directly above the boulevard. The Gardiner–Don Valley ramps provide access to the section of the Gardiner Expressway west of <b>the</b> <b>parkway.</b> There is no access either from or to the Gardiner east of <b>the</b> <b>parkway.</b> To travel east from the southbound lanes of <b>the</b> <b>parkway,</b> motorists must exit via the off-ramp to Lake Shore Boulevard, which meets the Lake Shore at a signalized intersection.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Parkway</b> begins where US20 expands to {{a divided}} highway {{southeast}} of Elkhart. To the east in Indiana the freeway feeds into an undivided segment of US20 at County Road 17 (CR17). From there it runs westward {{along the south}} sides of Elkhart and Mishawaka. South of South Bend, US31 joins <b>the</b> <b>Parkway,</b> and then <b>the</b> <b>Parkway</b> turns northward along {{the west side of}} South Bend. Along this segment, US20 turns back west and leaves <b>the</b> <b>Parkway.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Parkway</b> meets the Indiana Toll Road which carries I-80/I-90 before crossing the state line into Michigan. West of Niles, <b>the</b> <b>Parkway</b> meets US12 and continues northwesterly running west of Berrien Springs. From there it runs northward to end at Napier Avenue east of St. Joseph. The St. Joseph Valley Parkway ends at Napier Avenue, but US31 continues as a five-lane highway west along Napier to connect with I-94 {{and the rest of the}} US31 routing north of there on I-196.|$|E
5|$|Donald Cousens Parkway is {{intended}} to relieve north-south traffic congestion on York Regional Road68 (Main Street, former Highway48) and York Regional Road69 (Ninth Line), with signage suggesting drivers use <b>the</b> <b>parkway</b> as a through route past Markham.

5000|$|Being {{a part of}} the [...] "Belt System", its exit {{numbering}} is {{a continuation}} of <b>the</b> Belt <b>Parkway,</b> with exit numbers increasing north. At exit 25A (Southern State <b>Parkway),</b> <b>the</b> Cross Island <b>Parkway</b> becomes <b>the</b> Belt <b>Parkway</b> (more specifically, <b>the</b> section once known as <b>the</b> Laurelton <b>Parkway).</b> Before its exits were renumbered to align with <b>the</b> Belt <b>Parkway,</b> they were numbered to co-align with <b>the</b> Southern State <b>Parkway,</b> which is why that parkway begins with exit 13 (<b>the</b> Cross Island <b>Parkway</b> was once exits 1 to 12).|$|R
50|$|The Belt System is {{a series}} of {{connected}} limited-access highways that form a belt-like circle around the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. The system comprises four officially separate parkways; however, three of the four are signed as <b>the</b> Belt <b>Parkway.</b> <b>The</b> three <b>parkways</b> that make up the signed Belt Parkway—the Shore <b>Parkway,</b> <b>the</b> Southern <b>Parkway</b> (not to be confused with <b>the</b> Southern State <b>Parkway),</b> and <b>the</b> Laurelton Parkway—are a combined 25.29 mi in length. <b>The</b> Cross Island <b>Parkway</b> makes up <b>the</b> fourth <b>parkway</b> in <b>the</b> system, but is signed separately.|$|R

5|$|In April 1950, the State Council of Parks met in Ardsley. Bronxville {{opposed the}} construction, {{claiming}} {{that there would}} be property value depreciation. However, there was no cited opposition for <b>the</b> <b>parkway</b> from any communities further north of Bronxville, and that officials from Westchester County were looking into ideas for an alternate route around Bronxville. At the time, the county had most of the right-of-way in Bronxville claimed, short of one piece. The need for <b>the</b> <b>parkway</b> was helped by the fact that widening of the Bronx River Parkway was not applicable due to land limitations and the prohibitory cost of acquiring land for a widening. <b>The</b> <b>parkway,</b> while creating a needed connection between the Saw Mill River Parkway and the Bronx River Parkway, would not answer the need for diverting traffic off the Hawthorne Circle and the issue {{of what to do with}} truck traffic. <b>The</b> <b>parkway,</b> if started, would take about three years to complete and would be constructed by the Taconic State Park Commission.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Ocean <b>Parkway</b> {{begins at}} a {{cloverleaf}} interchange with the southern terminus of <b>the</b> Meadowbrook State <b>Parkway</b> and <b>the</b> Bay <b>Parkway</b> in Jones Beach State Park. Proceeding eastward, <b>the</b> Ocean <b>Parkway</b> parallels <b>the</b> Bay <b>Parkway</b> through Jones Beach State Park, {{running along the}} beachfront and past multiple recreational facilities. Just after a connection to <b>the</b> Bay <b>Parkway,</b> <b>the</b> four-lane <b>parkway</b> passes a parking lot for Jones Beach, along with a turnoff into a secondary lot for the bathhouse and the Jones Beach Theatre. In front of that turnoff, the westbound lanes pass two ramps that lead to a large parking lot that spans {{the gap between the}} Ocean and Bay <b>parkways.</b> After <b>the</b> parking lot, <b>the</b> Ocean <b>Parkway</b> enters a roundabout around the Jones Beach Water Tower (locally known as [...] "The Pencil"), marking the southern terminus of <b>the</b> Wantagh State <b>Parkway.</b>|$|R
50|$|Laid out in {{the form}} of a cross, <b>the</b> <b>parkways</b> run for four blocks with {{vegetation}} between the lanes for the two directions; they were completed in 1920 after a year of construction. Historic research has identified both streets as fine examples of the implementation of City Beautiful ideas in an extant city. Today, <b>the</b> <b>parkways</b> continue to provide access to a residential neighborhood; most of the houses that line <b>the</b> <b>parkways</b> are newer than the streets themselves, having been built primarily between 1930 and 1959.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of Peterborough's parkways are dual carriageways, {{to accommodate the}} large quantity of local traffic within the city, and national and regional traffic bypassing it. However, due to their age, many of <b>the</b> <b>parkways</b> do not have hard-shoulders. Most of <b>the</b> <b>parkways</b> that bypass <b>the</b> city have graded roundabout junctions.|$|R
5|$|The {{interchange}} with Highway403 also initially remained unmodified {{from the}} design constructed in 1969, with access between westbound Highway403 and eastbound on <b>the</b> <b>parkway</b> being {{provided by a}} loop ramp and access between westbound on <b>the</b> <b>parkway</b> and westbound Highway403 requiring a left turn at a traffic light.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>parkway</b> was {{proposed}} to help bridge {{a gap in}} the eastern part of the Long Island Parkway system. Construction began in 1949 with the opening of an interchange between Bay Shore Road and the Southern State Parkway. Work on <b>the</b> <b>parkway</b> itself began the following year, with plans calling for connections to three spurs: the Captree State Parkway (now Robert Moses Causeway), the Sunken Meadow Spur (Sunken Meadow State Parkway), and the Heckscher Spur (Heckscher State Parkway). <b>The</b> <b>parkway</b> was completed in 1952, closing the highway loop on Long Island. In 2001, a study by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) called for the Sagtikos State Parkway to be widened to include new bus and carpool lanes from end to end.|$|E

50|$|On August 11, 2003, <b>the</b> Breakheart Reservation <b>Parkways</b> (officially {{registered}} as Breakheart Reservation Parkways-Metropolitan Park System of Greater Boston) {{were added to}} the National Register of Historic Places. <b>The</b> <b>parkways</b> consist of Forest Street, Pine Tops Road, Elm Road, and Hemlock Road. <b>The</b> <b>parkways</b> are under <b>the</b> jurisdiction of the Department of Conservation and Recreation, which also controls Lynn Fells Parkway in Melrose and Saugus. In December 2002, the Massachusetts Historical Commission voted to nominate both <b>the</b> Lynn Fells <b>Parkway</b> and <b>the</b> Breakheart Reservation <b>Parkways</b> to <b>the</b> Keeper of the National Register, but only <b>the</b> Breakheart Reservation <b>Parkways</b> {{were added to the}} Register that year.

5|$|Traffic {{conditions}} on <b>the</b> <b>parkway</b> often exceed its intended capacity of 60,000 vehicles per day. Today, some sections carry {{an average of}} 100,000 vehicles a day and have bumper-to-bumper traffic conditions during commuting hours. <b>The</b> <b>parkway</b> was planned {{to be one of}} two north-south expressways into downtown Toronto. The other was cancelled due to public opposition, leaving the DVP as the sole north-south expressway into downtown. <b>The</b> <b>parkway</b> is also used by regional transit buses which can access designated lanes to pass slow-moving traffic.|$|E
5|$|Continuing north, <b>the</b> <b>parkway</b> {{encounters}} MD32 (Savage Road) near Fort Meade. MD32 offers northbound travelers {{direct access}} into the fort {{and to the}} National Security Agency, while the next interchange, another employee-only access road into Fort Meade, features only a southbound exit and northbound entrance. Fort Meade itself is a military installation opened in 1917 that trained 3.5 million troops during World War II and is still a major fort. To the west of <b>the</b> <b>parkway</b> off MD32 is the Savage Mill, which was an operating cotton mill from 1822 to 1947 and is currently an antique mall, and the Bollman Truss Railroad Bridge, an 1869 cast and wrought iron bridge along the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (now CSX's Capital Subdivision) line between Baltimore and Washington D.C. After this interchange, the road continues to a cloverleaf interchange with MD175 (Jessup Road), where NPS maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>parkway</b> {{comes to an end}} {{at the south end of}} the interchange.|$|E
5|$|Continuing south-southwest, {{the river}} along with <b>the</b> <b>parkway</b> and trailway enter Hastings-on-Hudson, its {{greenbelt}} {{the only major}} break in the village's dense suburban development. It slowly veers toward a more southerly heading, and enters the Nepera Park neighborhood of Yonkers after one mile (1.6km), just south of Farragut Parkway. Once in the neighborhood, the Saw Mill River flows through a Yonkers sewage treatment plant, the other impoundment of the river. After leaving the plant, 1.5 miles (2km) {{to the south of}} where the river entered Yonkers, <b>the</b> <b>parkway</b> and trailway diverge from the river after , to climb over the watershed divide to Tibbetts Brook. Saw Mill River Road continues to parallel its namesake.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> Christiana <b>Parkway</b> around <b>the</b> {{southern}} edge of Newark was completed in September 1983 and DE 4 was realigned to use <b>the</b> Christiana <b>Parkway</b> by 1987, ending at DE 2 (Elkton Road) in the southwestern part of Newark. DE 896 was rerouted to use <b>the</b> Christiana <b>Parkway</b> <b>the</b> following year with DE 2 following by 1990. The DE 2 designation was removed from <b>the</b> Christiana <b>Parkway</b> in 2013.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>parkways</b> were {{intended}} to carry light pleasure vehicles between the parks, with no access to heavier commercial vehicles. It was not until 1958 that the city opened up <b>the</b> <b>parkways</b> to all commercial and passenger traffic. As the city expanded and <b>the</b> <b>parkways</b> became heavily traveled roads, they have been widened beyond their original two lanes, in many cases sacrificing the grass medians and tree-lined yards that were originally a part of them. Still, as of 2000, 75% of the original trees remained or {{had been replaced by}} new trees. There were 5,107 trees along <b>the</b> <b>parkways</b> according to a 1994 count. [...] Between 2008 and 2011, a major project was undertaken to restore many of the trees that had been damaged by storms, traffic, or age and disease. This has filled in many of the canopy gaps along <b>the</b> <b>parkways,</b> and was done as much as possible in accordance with the original Olmstedian plan. Today there are various proposals being debated to ease traffic issues and restore connectivity of the city's parks via these routes. One such plan involves bike lanes and center lanes for turning.|$|R

5|$|Early {{proposals}} {{made by the}} National Capital Park and Planning Commission {{involved a}} route that followed US1 north to MD198, then east to Fort Meade, but lack of funding led to simpler plans to widen US 1 instead. During the 1930s, the New Deal programs promulgated by President Franklin Roosevelt led to a heightened awareness of <b>the</b> <b>parkway</b> proposals; a 1937 report by the Maryland State Planning Commission increased awareness further. Increasing accident levels on US 1 (which was {{called one of the}} deadliest roads in the world at the time) along with awareness of the need to mobilize national defense before World War II provided additional motivation for construction of <b>the</b> <b>parkway.</b>|$|E
