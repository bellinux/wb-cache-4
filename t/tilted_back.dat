5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis <b>tilted</b> <b>back</b> from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E
25|$|A {{recliner}} is a reclining armchair. It has {{a backrest}} {{that can be}} <b>tilted</b> <b>back,</b> causing a footrest to extend from the front. Edward Knabusch and Edwin Shoemaker invented the first recliner in Monroe, Michigan in 1928 when they modified a wooden porch chair so that the seat moved forward as the back reclined. A padded model was later developed.|$|E
25|$|The need {{to control}} {{systematic}} error in the measurement of the CMB anisotropy and measuring the zodiacal cloud at different elongation angles for subsequent modeling required that the satellite rotate at a 0.8 rpm spin rate. The spin axis is also <b>tilted</b> <b>back</b> from the orbital velocity vector as a precaution against possible deposits of residual atmospheric gas on the optics as well against the infrared glow that would result from fast neutral particles hitting its surfaces at extremely high speed.|$|E

25|$|After {{arranging}} the yerba {{along one side}} of the gourd, the mate is carefully <b>tilted</b> <b>back</b> onto its base, minimizing further disturbances of the yerba as it is re-oriented to allow consumption. Some settling is normal, but is not desirable. The angled mound of yerba should remain, with its powdery peak still flat and mostly level with the top of the gourd. A layer of stems along its slope will slide downward and accumulate in the space opposite the yerba (though at least a portion should remain in place).|$|E
25|$|On December 7, 1923, former President Adolfo de la Huerta {{launched}} {{a military coup}} (delahuertista rebellion) against the government of President Álvaro Obregón. The situation was extremely critical, because along with de la Huerta, about 60% of the army revolted, including various high-ranking generals across the country. The power <b>tilted</b> <b>back</b> {{in favor of the}} federal forces when the United States agreed to furnish the Mexican government with a fleet of new de Havilland DH-4B aircraft equipped with the Liberty motor, armed with Lewis and Vickers machine guns and able to carry bombs. The military coup was then suffocated by February 1924.|$|E

[...] The artwork for the single was shot in black-and-white, the same technique which was used for Rihanna's previous single's artwork, [...] "We Found Love". [...] "You da Ones artwork displays the singer with her head <b>tilted</b> <b>back</b> and her eyes closed holding a cigarette between her lips.

500|$|Erica Wexler from Spin {{described}} Madonna on {{the cover}} as [...] "like a cobra basking in the hot sun, Madonna {{on the cover}} of her new album stretches her profile lasciviously." [...] Author J. Randy Taraborrelli commented in , that the album cover indicated how True Blue was a vehicle of growth for Madonna. He felt that the [...] "washed out color photograph" [...] of her with head <b>tilted</b> <b>back</b> and eyes closed was [...] "understated", especially when compared to the sexier poses she had been associated in the past. The album's inner sleeve did not feature any photographs, and instead was dedicated to album credits and the song lyrics, since Madonna wanted to be represented by her songs on True Blue, not her image. Billboard listed the cover at rank 34 on their article about the [...] "50 Greatest Album Covers", describing it as a striking image of the singer.|$|E
500|$|The {{skull of}} Heterodontosaurus was small but robustly built. The two most {{complete}} skulls measured [...] (holotype specimen SAM-PK-K337) and [...] (specimen SAM-PK-K1332) in length. The skull was elongated, narrow, and triangular {{when viewed from}} the side, with the highest point being the sagittal crest, from where the skull sloped down towards the snout tip. The back of the skull ended in a hook-like shape, which was offset to the quadrate bone. The orbit (eye opening) was large and circular, and a large spur-like bone, the palpebral, protruded backwards into {{the upper part of}} the opening. Below the eye socket, the jugal bone gave rise to a sideways projecting boss, or horn-like structure. The jugal bone also formed a [...] "blade" [...] that created a slot together with a flange on the pterygoid bone, for guiding the motion of the lower jaw. Ventrally, the antorbital fossa was bounded by a prominent bony ridge, to which the animal's fleshy cheek would have been attached. The proportionally large lower temporal fenestra was egg-shaped and <b>tilted</b> <b>back,</b> and located behind the eye opening. The elliptical upper temporal fenestra was visible only looking at the top of the skull. The left and right upper temporal fenestrae were separated by the sagittal crest, which would have provided lateral attachment surfaces for the jaw musculature in the living animal.|$|E

50|$|An {{example of}} this is {{erecting}} the mast of a large mobile drilling rig. The mast is erected to the vertical position using a telescopic cylinder. However, to lower the mast, gravity is not available for the initial <b>tilt</b> <b>back</b> from the vertical position. Thus, the plunger stage only of the telescopic actuator is equipped as a double acting cylinder to provide the initial force to pull the mast back from vertical. Once the <b>tilt</b> <b>back</b> has been initiated, then gravity takes over and supplies the force to complete the full cylinder retraction. The remaining stages, therefore, are single acting. This special combination is much less complex and much less costly than using an entirely double acting design.|$|R

We assessed the hemodynamics underlying PPFH in a retrospective study. Methods Seven patients (2 females, aged 31 – 72 years) experiencing PPFH were studied. PPFH {{was defined as a}} systolic BP below 85 mmHg for at least 2 min after <b>tilt</b> <b>back.</b> In 6 out of 7 presyncope was provoked by 0. 4 mg sublingual NTG, administered in the 60 ° head-up tilt position following head-up tilt for 20 min.

50|$|By definition, lift is {{perpendicular}} to the oncoming flow. As the left wing moves up, its effective angle of attack is decreased, so its lift vector <b>tilts</b> <b>back.</b> Conversely, as the right wing descends, its lift vector tilts forward.
