5|$|The Salem {{district}} administration in India advised farmers in 2012 not {{to invest in}} the emu business which was being heavily promoted at the time; further investigation was needed to assess the profitability of farming the birds in India. In the United States, it was reported in 2013 that many ranchers had left the emu business; it was estimated that the number of growers had dropped from over five thousand in 1998 <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> thousand in 2013. The remaining growers increasingly rely on sales of oil for their profit, although, leather, eggs, and meat are also sold.|$|E
5|$|When submerged, a crocodilian's {{heart rate}} slows down <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> beats a minute, and {{blood flow to}} the muscles is reduced. When it rises and takes a breath, its heart rate speeds up in seconds, and the muscles receive newly oxygenated blood. Unlike many marine mammals, {{crocodilians}} have little myoglobin to store oxygen in their muscles. During diving, muscles are supplied with oxygen when an increasing concentration of bicarbonate ions causes haemoglobin in the blood to release oxygen.|$|E

5|$|With the {{introduction}} of Pokémon breeding, Pokémon are assigned <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> breeding groups. When a male and female Pokémon that share at least one breeding group are left at a Pokémon Daycare, they may produce an egg, which will hatch into a young Pokémon. The young Pokémon will inherit the species of its mother, and moves from its father. However, legendary Pokémon, among certain other species, cannot breed.|$|E

Aarhus is on average host <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> international sailing competitions {{every year and}} hosted the ISAF Youth Sailing World Championships in 2008 and will in 2018 host the ISAF Sailing World Championships, the world championship for the 12 Olympic sailing disciplines and an important qualifier for the 2020 Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Army Group Centre renewed their {{offensive}} on Moscow in mid-November. Fegelein and the SS Cavalry Brigade {{were held}} back as an operational reserve in the rearward {{area of the}} 9th Army. Massive counter-attacks by the Red Army led to a weakening of the entire German line, and the brigade {{was called in to}} fight at the front on 28 December. While Fegelein reported that his forces were the equivalent <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> divisions, in reality he had only 4,428 men in total at this point, of which 1,800 were ready for action. The brigade was deployed at the south-eastern sector of the XXIII Army Corps, where it defended against attacks in the rearward area of the 206th Infantry Division in the Battles of Rzhev. The SS Cavalry Brigade took serious losses, with casualties of up to 60 per cent in some squadrons.|$|E

5|$|Dirks' work in {{computational}} chemistry involved creating algorithms and computational {{tools for}} the analysis of nucleic acid thermodynamics and nucleic acid structure prediction. Dirks wrote the initial code for the NUPACK suite of nucleic acid design and analysis tools, which generates base pairing probabilities through calculation of the statistical partition function. Unlike other structure prediction tools, NUPACK is capable of handling an arbitrary number of interacting strands rather than being limited <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two.</b> Dirks also developed an algorithm capable of efficiently handling certain types of pseudoknots, a class of structure that is more computationally intensive to analyze, although NUPACK only implements this ability for single RNA strands.|$|E
5|$|Two {{significant}} {{items of}} jewellery from Northumbria {{in this period}} have survived. The Ripon Jewel, discovered in the precincts of Ripon Cathedral in 1977, is difficult to date but its grandeur {{and the location of}} the find have suggested a link with Bishop Wilfrid, whose rich furnishings of the church at Ripon are on record. Bishop Cuthbert's pectoral cross was buried with him during Aldfrith's reign, either at his death in 687 or his reburial in 698 and is now at Durham Cathedral. There are few surviving architectural or monumental remains from the period. The Bewcastle Cross, the Ruthwell Cross and the Hexham Cross are probably to be dated <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> generations after Aldfrith's time. Escomb Church is the best preserved Northumbrian church of the period, dated to the late 7th century. The ruined chapel at Heysham, overlooking Morecambe Bay, may be somewhat later in date.|$|E

25|$|In December 1919, Major E. H. Armstrong gave {{publicity}} to {{an indirect}} {{method of obtaining}} short-wave amplification, called the super-heterodyne. The idea {{is to reduce the}} incoming frequency, which may be, say 1,500,000 cycles (200 meters), to some suitable super-audible frequency that can be amplified efficiently, then passing this current through a radio frequency amplifier and finally rectifying and carrying on <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> stages of audio frequency amplification.|$|E

25|$|The use of Mocatta's modular station designs was not perpetuated.

Jacomb-Hood and Frederick Banister (1860–1895). Banister had a love of Italianate architecture, meaning that during the 1880s the LB produced elaborate decorated architecture for many country stations, notably on the Bluebell and Cuckoo Lines. The architect was Banister's son-in-law, Thomas Myres.|$|E

25|$|Pitch accent (tone accent) is {{a feature}} of certain {{languages}} whose variations in pitch (linguistic tones) {{can be used to}} differentiate words, but the potentially distinctive tones are restricted <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> syllables within a word. This contrasts with fully-tonal languages like Standard Chinese in which each syllable can have an independent tone. In a pitch accent language, the syllable with phonemic tone is typically acoustically prominent (stressed). Also, many words may not be marked for tone at all.|$|E

Tickets are valid for two hours, all day and for longer periods, such as weekly and monthly. Within the time periods, tickets can be used on an unlimited number of services and all modes (train, tram, and bus). There is no extra fee for transfers. Various discounts are also available, such as for off-peak travel and buying tickets in bulk.|$|E
