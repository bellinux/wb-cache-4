5|$|Adults have neutral grey heads, brown necks, brown-sepia striped backs, and grey-white bellies, breasts, and throats. Males {{have some}} buff {{markings}} on <b>their</b> <b>breasts,</b> and less sharp brown spots on their napes than females. The Perijá tapaculo is a secretive bird and therefore difficult to observe; {{as a result}} its ecology is poorly known. It feeds on insects and reproduces between April and July. Its range is partially within Chamicero de Perijá Bird Reserve in Colombia and the Sierra de Perijá National Park in Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|The forehead, lores, crown, mantle, and {{scapular}} {{area are}} a neutral grey colour. There is a brown {{spot on the}} nape. The top of the tail is brown, and the bottom is faintly striped brown. The bird's back and rump are striped brown-sepia, and the throat, breast, and belly are grey-white. Its lower belly and flanks are tawny. The iris is dark brown. Male specimens are distinguished by having less sharp brown spots on their napes, and the bottom of <b>their</b> <b>breasts</b> are mixed with a pale buff colour. The legs are brown {{on the back and}} whitish on the front. Young birds have a yellowish appearance with striped brown flanks.|$|E

5|$|One day at Emain Macha, Cú Chulainn overhears Cathbad {{teaching}} his pupils. One {{asks him}} what that day is auspicious for, and Cathbad replies that any warrior who takes arms that day will have everlasting fame. Cú Chulainn, though only seven years old, goes to Conchobar {{and asks for}} arms. None of the weapons given to him withstand his strength, until Conchobar gives him his own weapons. But when Cathbad sees this he grieves, because he had not finished his prophecy—the warrior who took arms that day would be famous, but his life would be short. Soon afterwards, {{in response to a}} similar prophecy by Cathbad, Cú Chulainn demands a chariot from Conchobar, and only the king's own chariot withstands him. He sets off on a foray and kills the three sons of Nechtan Scéne, who had boasted they had killed more Ulstermen than there were Ulstermen still living. He returns to Emain Macha in his battle frenzy, and the Ulstermen are afraid he will slaughter them all. Conchobar's wife Mugain leads out the women of Emain, and they bare <b>their</b> <b>breasts</b> to him. He averts his eyes, and the Ulstermen wrestle him into a barrel of cold water, which explodes from the heat of his body. They put him in a second barrel, which boils, and a third, which warms to a pleasant temperature.|$|E

25|$|Younger {{women with}} {{an age of}} less than 40 years or women over 80 years {{tend to have a}} poorer {{prognosis}} than post-menopausal women due to several factors. <b>Their</b> <b>breasts</b> may change with their menstrual cycles, they may be nursing infants, and they may be unaware of changes in <b>their</b> <b>breasts.</b> Therefore, younger women are usually at a more advanced stage when diagnosed.

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{women are}} unable to {{practice}} exclusive breastfeeding because they are separated from their infants while working. Expressing <b>their</b> <b>breast</b> milk helps them to continue breastfeeding. This study explores the perception and experiences related to the feasibility, acceptability and safety of breast milk expression among formally employed women in Kelantan, Malaysia. Methods A qualitative method using in-depth interviews was conducted from December 2008 to December 2009 among Malay women from urban and rural areas. A snowball sampling method was used to recruit the informants, and the interviews, which were facilitated by an interview guide, were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was conducted, with construction of codes and themes from each interview. Results Analysis of the interviews with 20 informants identified three themes related to breast milk expression. The themes were as follows: (i) lack of feasibility of expressing breast milk, (ii) negative feelings about expressing breast milk, and (iii) doubts about the safety and hygiene of expressed breast milk. The informants who did not practice exclusive breastfeeding believed that expressing <b>their</b> <b>breast</b> milk was not feasible, commonly because they felt there were not enough facilities for them. They also had negative feelings such as embarrassment. The safety and hygiene of the expressed breast milk was also their main concern. Conclusion More practical and focused education, as well as provision of facilities, is needed for women to effectively and safely express and store <b>their</b> <b>breast</b> milk. The issue of inadequate milk production should be emphasized, especially by encouraging them to express <b>their</b> <b>breast</b> milk {{as a way to}} improve milk production. </p...|$|R
25|$|Tropical {{species of}} pigeons can display a rich variety of colour, presumably to {{facilitate}} species recognition. The plumage of the seed-eating genera of Columbidae {{is more often}} dull brown or grey. Typically imperial pigeons have dark dorsum and wings, ranging from grey to iridescent green. <b>Their</b> <b>breasts</b> are paler, ranging in colour from grey through orange and pink to dark grey. Less conspicuous markings are found on birds isolated to islands. Most species display little or no sexual dimorphism.|$|E
25|$|Davuls were {{ideal for}} use as {{military}} instruments because of the unique {{way in which they}} could be carried. The Ottoman janissaries, for example, hung their davuls at <b>their</b> <b>breasts</b> with thick straps. This made it easier for the soldiers to carry their instruments from battle to battle. This practice {{does not seem to be}} limited to just the Ottoman Empire, however; in Egypt, drums very similar to davuls were braced with cords, which allowed the Egyptian soldiers to carry them during military movements.|$|E
25|$|The shape, size, position, symmetry, spacing, firmness, {{and amount}} of sagging of {{individual}} women's breasts vary considerably.

Even within a single country, one study found that the bra label size was consistently different from the measured size. As a result, about 25% of women have a difficult time finding a properly fitted bra. Some women choose to buy custom-made bras due to the unusual size or shape of <b>their</b> <b>breasts.</b>|$|E
