25|$|It is {{possible}} that the turbulence caused the <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> driving the port elevator to break; this would allow the port elevator to move freely, but the pilots would still retain approximately half of their attitude control.

25|$|The {{government}} therefore appointed {{three new}} {{members to the}} commission on 6 February 1987 and ordered a new investigation of the accident. The new members were Appeal Judge Christian Borchsenius, Erik Øie of the Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration and Professor Janne Carlzon of the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. The expanded commission was ordered to especially look into three issues: all air movements in the area at the time; how {{the crack in the}} <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> was caused; and the use of medication by the pilot.|$|E
25|$|The UH-1H's dual {{controls}} are conventional for a helicopter and {{consist of a}} single hydraulic system boosting the cyclic stick, collective lever and anti-torque pedals. The collective levers have integral throttles, although these {{are not used to}} control rotor rpm, which is automatically governed, but are used for starting and shutting down the engine. The cyclic and collective control the main rotor pitch through <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> linkages to the swash plate, while the anti-torque pedals change the pitch of the tail rotor via a tensioned cable arrangement.

25|$|The {{direct cause}} of the {{accident}} is presumed to be {{the collapse of the}} vertical stabilizer. There are two alternative explanations for how the crash may have happened. The first explanation is that the lack of vertical control caused by the broken elevator <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> stalled the aircraft. Be{{cause of the}} lack of pitch control, {{it would have been easy}} for the aircraft to fall back into a stall repeatedly, each time losing altitude. The aircraft would thus eventually have fallen into the sea. The vertical fin and rudder would have broken off on impact. This theory does not explain why the vertical stabilizer was found at such a distance from the aircraft.|$|E
500|$|A single dry-plate clutch and an unsynchronized three-speed gearbox were {{bolted to}} the engine. [...] The gearbox was {{operated}} directly with a central shift lever. The drive shaft was enclosed in a <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> and drove the live rear axle through a spiral bevel drive.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe use of {{electric}} motors {{in the domain}} of naval propulsion requires fewer prime movers and auxiliary equipment than conventional propulsion systems. Thus, the performance in terms of efficiency, reliability and survivability is increased. Moreover, the dynamic behavior of a chip required motor which transmit low speed and high torque on the propellers. The challenge of the electric company is to develop a motor with highly compact equipment and low mechanical vibration to optimize the available space on board and the comfort of customers. In this case, we propose a new kind of an axial HTS motor which includes a superconducting magnetic coupling. Its goal is to transmit the torque create by HTS motor (coldest part) to the load (warmest part) without mechanical contact. Therefore, we don't need the <b>torque</b> <b>tubes</b> which are classically used in conventional HTS motor to link the inductor to the shaft. The absence of heat conduction generated by the <b>torque</b> <b>tubes</b> reduces the power of the cryogenic system and thereby increases the efficiency of the motor. Secondly, the contactless transmission is a natural harmonic filter which removes the torque pulsation and mechanical vibration on the shaft. During our study, we have developed an analytical modeling of the motor based on the resolution of Maxwell's equations which include the behavior of the superconducting coils in function of the applied magnetic field and temperature. Then a small prototype of the propulsion system has been developed to study the interaction between motor and magnetic coupling and the behavior of the HTS tapes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHigh Temperature Superconducting (HTS) {{electrical}} machines have high torque density {{with a very}} high efficiency. <b>Torque</b> <b>tubes</b> are usually used to transmit the torque from the cold to the warm environment which results in thermal losses and mechanical problems. To overcome these difficulties, we propose to transmit the torque of the HTS machine through an integrated HTS magnetic coupling.

The machine and the coupling share the same HTS rotor while the torque produced by the machine is transmitted to the load via a permanent magnets rotor. This solution allows the reduction of the thermal losses and a natural protection against overload during fault. The electromagnetic design is carried out using 3 D finite elements. The HTS material electrical behavior is described using a power law so it was possible to determine the operating current of the HTS coils of the device.

As the car utilized a wet clutch, this condition could also occur in cold weather, when the thickened oil prevents the clutch discs from slipping freely. Power reached the differential through a single universal joint attached to a <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> which drove the rear axle; some models (typically trucks, but available for cars, as well) could be equipped with an optional two-speed Ruckstell rear axle shifted by a floor-mounted lever which provided an underdrive gear for easier hill climbing.
