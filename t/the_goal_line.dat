5|$|In {{front of}} the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line,</b> two lines {{starting}} on <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> 16.5m (18yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5m (18yd) into the pitch perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line,</b> and a line joining them. This area {{has a number of}} functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul {{by a member of the}} defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.|$|E
5|$|Corner kick: {{when the}} ball has wholly crossed <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the {{defending}} team; awarded to attacking team.|$|E
5|$|Vanderbilt beat Mississippi 24–0, the {{visitors}} showing a strong defense. Morgan, Collins, and Sikes {{were on the}} sidelines for the whole game. Multiple times, the Commodores fumbled near <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the first}} half, by much rushing, forcing, snapbacks and {{vigorous}} bullyragging Riggs, the huge Hopkins quarterback, crashed over <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> for 4 points. Paul Dashiell converted. Riggs repeated his performance but Dashiell missed conversion. Navy then adopted the Hopkins rushing tactics and Stone went over for the first score.|$|E
5|$|In Game 6, Pittsburgh got goals from Malkin, {{his first}} in the Finals, and Hossa. Entering the final minute and {{trailing}} by one, Pittsburgh pulled Fleury {{for the second time}} that game, hoping to score with circumstances similar to Hossa's earlier goal. A tipped shot which passed in between Chris Osgood and <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> as time expired did not enter the net, giving Detroit the victory. Pittsburgh's final defeat of the season was by a score of 3–2.|$|E
5|$|United {{responded to}} the goal immediately, as Giggs made a surging run through the Barcelona defence before playing the ball to Berbatov in the inside-right channel. The Bulgarian forward's low cross found Giggs in the centre, and the United captain's shot was {{deflected}} to Ronaldo {{on the far side}} of the goal, only for the Portuguese's shot to be blocked by Valdés. The resulting corner reached Berbatov {{on the far side of}} the goal, but it was deemed to have crossed <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> first and Barcelona were awarded a goal kick, from which they launched another attack. Messi played a through-ball to Puyol on the right flank, but as the Barcelona captain reached <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line,</b> he was fouled by Ronaldo, who – despite going in two-footed – escaped the referee's book. Puyol himself rose to head Xavi's free kick towards goal, but it was directly at Van der Sar, who claimed the ball easily.|$|E

5|$|A similar {{play in the}} game's {{second half}} scored another {{touchdown}}. Quarterback Doc Kuhn dropped back for a more than 40-yard touchdown pass to Bomar. The pass went 28 yards in the air, with Bomar running {{the rest of the}} way. Georgia running back Dave Collings tackled him as he crossed <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> (injuring himself), and Bomar also made an interception in the 12–0 Vanderbilt victory. The season's final game, against Vanderbilt's oldest rival Sewanee, had a trick play by the Commodores. A fake run ended with Kuhn tossing the ball to Bomar, who was left open behind the defense and easily ran it in; Vanderbilt won, 26–0.|$|E
5|$|After taking {{possession}} {{on his own}} 16-yard line, Georgia quarterback and true freshman Matthew Stafford caused the first turning point of the game as he threw an interception to Brenden Hill of Virginia Tech. Starting deep in Georgia territory, Virginia Tech was further aided by a personal foul on Georgia, which set up a first-and-goal situation for Virginia Tech on the Georgia 6-yard line. A two-yard run by Virginia Tech tailback Branden Ore brought the ball closer to <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> and ended {{the first quarter of}} play.|$|E
5|$|All line {{markings}} on the pitch {{form part of}} the area which they define. For example, a ball on the side line {{is still in the}} field of play; a ball on the line of the penalty circle is in the penalty circle; a foul committed over the 23-metre (25-yard) line has occurred in the 23-metre area. A ball must completely cross a boundary line to be out of play, and a ball must wholly cross <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> before a goal is scored.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second quarter, Tennessee had the ball at its 19-yard line, facing a second down and ten. On the first play of the quarter, Tennessee ran an end-around to Kendrick Jones, who ran the ball for 76 yards, giving the Volunteers a first down at the Virginia Tech five-yard line. Three plays later, running back Jay Graham crossed <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> for the first Tennessee touchdown of the second quarter. The extra point was good, and with 13:23 remaining in the first half, Tennessee took a 210 lead.|$|E
5|$|Because California {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's Mike Imoh fielded the ball at <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> and returned it 40yards. Bryan Randall {{got off to a}} good start, completing two passes for 26yards, and Kevin Jones ran the ball another 16yards. After pushing inside the California red zone, however, the California defense stiffened and Tech was prevented from gaining another first down. Kicker Carter Warley attempted his third field goal of the game—this one a 28-yard kick—but as before, the kick was no good.|$|E
5|$|Because Stanford {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech received it to begin the second half. After starting from their 21-yard line, the Hokies went three-and-out. Following a Tech punt, Stanford's first drive {{of the second half}} began at its 41-yard line. Two plays gained 13yards and a first down, then Stanford began battering Virginia Tech with its passing offense. Luck threw four consecutive passes: the first was incomplete, but the next three went for 10, 17, and 18yards, respectively. This gave Stanford a first down at the Tech one-yard line. Three plays later, Owen Marecic crossed <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> on a running play. The subsequent extra point was missed, and Stanford extended its lead to 19–12 with 8:47 remaining.|$|E
50|$|The {{pitch is}} {{rectangular}} in shape. The longer sides are called touchlines. The other opposing sides are called <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>The</b> two <b>goal</b> <b>lines</b> must be between 45 and 90 m {{and be the}} same length. The two touch lines must also be of the same length, and be between 90 and 120 m in length. All lines must be equally wide, not to exceed 12 cm. The corners of the pitch are marked by corner flags.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the limited}} {{dimensions}} of the indoor arena, special rules were adopted for the game: the tanbark-covered field itself was only 80 yards long (60 yards between <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>lines)</b> and 45 yards wide, 10 yards narrower than the regulation width at the time. The sidelines were butted up against <b>the</b> stands. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> posts were moved from the endlines to <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>lines.</b> <b>The</b> ball was automatically moved back 20 yards every time one team crossed the 10-yard line. For the first time, all plays started with the ball on or between the hash marks, which were ten yards from the sidelines. Additionally, drop kicks and field goals were banned.|$|R

5|$|Cody {{personally}} {{took over}} the Auburn game after Vanderbilt was up 17–0. In {{one of the greatest}} exhibitions of punt covering, Cody smothered the receiver every time, recovering two fumbles, including one across <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> for a touchdown. Then, in the last ten seconds of play, Cody dropped kicked a three-pointer from the 33-yard line. In the season's final game against rival Sewanee, tackles Cody and Tom Lipscomb blocked a punt leading to the game's second touchdown. Irby Curry later had an 80-yard touchdown with Cody clearing the path. The final score was 28–3. Cody also received an offer to play for Navy.|$|E
5|$|Despite Arsenal being {{reduced to}} 10 men, the scores {{remained}} {{level as the}} game went into its final minute, when Diego Forlán went to ground in the penalty area under a challenge from Arsenal defender Martin Keown while trying to reach a Gary Neville cross. The referee deemed this a foul and awarded a penalty. Van Nistelrooy stepped up to take the penalty, despite having missed his previous two penalties for Manchester United. Lehmann tried to put him off by moving {{from side to side}} along <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line,</b> and it appeared to work: the shot hit the bar and rebounded back into play, and the Dutchman was immediately confronted by Keown. Within a minute, the final whistle blew and the match finished as a goalless draw.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's offense {{returned}} to the field with 4:35 remaining and needing to score rapidly {{in order to make}} up the 18-point deficit, the game's largest. The Seminoles began their drive with their passing offense, trying three passes in four plays. Quarterback Manuel completed two of those three pass attempts, gaining 37 yards and advancing deep into Virginia Tech territory. A pass interference penalty against Virginia Tech advanced the Seminoles to the Tech 11-yard line, and three rushing plays later, running back Ty Jones crossed <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> for a touchdown. The score came with 1:40 remaining in the quarter and brought the score to 35–24.|$|E

5|$|However, the Crimson Tide {{were unable}} to {{capitalize}} on the drive that ensued after Kenyan Drake fumbled the ball at <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> and was recovered by the Vols' Cameron Sutton. Looking to score before halftime, Tennessee drove from their one-yard line to the Alabama 24 before Worley threw his second interception of the game. This time Landon Collins made the play at the 11-yard line and returned it 89-yards for a touchdown and a 35–0 halftime lead. Tennessee opened the second half with their first points on a 37-yard Michael Palardy field goal that made the score 35–3. The Crimson Tide responded later in the third with Yeldon's third one-yard touchdown run of the game and extended their lead to 42–3.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} game Georgia Tech {{defeated}} Furman 25–0, playing mainly substitutes. Hay was spread on the field {{in an attempt to}} counteract the steady downpour. Tech quarterback Al Hill scored two touchdowns, and Dan Whelchel (called Walthall) scored a third when he recovered a fumble by Theodore Shaver after crossing <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line.</b> Although Furman's lineup included future South Carolina Hall-of-Famer Speedy Speer, there was little Speer could do to affect the outcome. Tech's starting lineup was Ulrich (left end), Higgins (left tackle), Whelchel (left guard), Johnson (center), Wright (right guard), Doyle (right tackle), Colcord (right end), Hill (quarterback), Smith (left halfback), Shaver (right halfback), and Harlan (fullback).|$|E
5|$|Kendrick {{returned}} Clemson's post-score kickoff to the Tech 23-yard line. A two-yard run by Suggs {{was followed}} by a pass to Davis at the Tech 39-yard line for a first down. Two running plays set up third down and two, then Vick completed a 50-yard pass to Kendrick, who picked up a first down at the Clemson four-yard line. From there, it took Suggs two rushes to pass <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> <b>line</b> for Virginia Tech's third touchdown of the game. The extra point was good, and Tech extended its lead to 2110 with 2:26 before halftime.|$|E
