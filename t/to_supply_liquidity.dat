5000|$|Although the European Central Bank (ECB) has {{supplied}} {{large amounts}} of liquidity through both open market operations and lending to individual banks in 2008, it was hesitant <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>liquidity</b> during the sovereign crisis of 2010. According to Paul De Grauwe, the ECB should be the lender of last resort in the government bond market and supply liquidity to its member countries just {{as it does to}} the financial sector. That is because the reasons that the lender of last resort is necessary in the banking sector {{can be applied to the}} government bond market analogously. Just like banks that lend long-term while borrowing short-term, governments have highly illiquid assets like infrastructure and maturing debt. If they do not succeed in rolling over their debt, they become illiquid just as banks that run out of liquidity and are not supported by a lender of last resort. The distrust of investors can then increase the rates the government has to pay on its debt, which, in a self-fulfilling way, leads to a solvency crisis. Because banks hold the greatest proportion of government debt, not saving the government may make it necessary to save the banks, in turn. [...] "The single most important argument for mandating the ECB to be a lender of last resort in the government bond markets is to prevent countries from being pushed into a bad equilibrium." ...|$|E

This paper studies the impact of pre-trade transparency on liquidity in a market where risk-averse traders accommodate the liquidity demand of noise traders. When some risk-averse investors become informed, an adverse selection problem ensues for the others, making them reluctant <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>liquidity.</b> Hence the disclosure of traders' identities improves liquidity by mitigating adverse selection. However, informed investors are effective liquidity suppliers, as their adverse selection and inventory costs are minimized. With endogenous information acquisition, transparency reduces the number of informed investors, thus decreasing liquidity.

In addition, we conduct an empirical investigation with tick level data from US equity market through January 2008 to October 2010 to verify our con-clusion drawn from the simulation study. Based on the simulation and empirical results we collected, we show that the HFT can reduce the execution cost when supplying liquidity...|$|E
40|$|We study price pressures, i. e., {{deviations}} from the efficient price due <b>to</b> risk-averse intermediaries <b>supplying</b> <b>liquidity</b> <b>to</b> asynchronously arriving investors. Empirically, New York Stock Exchange intermediary data reveals economically large price pressures, 0. 49 % on average with a half life of 0. 92 days. Theoretically, a simple dynamic inventory model captures an intermediary's use of price pressure to mean-revert inventory. She trades off revenue loss due to price pressure against price risk associated with staying in a nonzero inventory state. The closed-form solution identifies the intermediary's risk aversion and the investors' private value distribution from the observed time series patterns of prices and inventories. These parameters imply a relative social cost due to price pressure, a deviation from constrained Pareto efficiency, of approximately 10 % {{of the cost of}} immediacy...|$|R
40|$|This paper gives a new {{answer to}} the {{challenging}} question raised by Glosten (1994) : "Is the electronic order book inevitable?".

We compare a competitive limit order book and a limit order book with a specialist, like the NYSE. Thanks to non-anonymous interaction, mediated by brokers, uninformed investors can obtain good liquidity from the specialist. This, however, creates an adverse selection problem on the limit order book. Market liquidity and social welfare are improved by the specialist if adverse selection is severe and if brokers have long horizon, so that reputation becomes a matter of concern for them. In contrast, if asymmetric information is limited, spreads are wider and utilitarian welfare is lower when the specialist competes with the limit order book than in a pure limit order book market.

Using a large and comprehensive data set which details the complete histories of orders and trades on the Vancouver Stock Exchange, we are able to model the order flow and measure market liquidity as it changes over time. We accomplish this by constructing a measure of the expected net payoffs <b>to</b> demanding or <b>supplying</b> <b>liquidity,</b> and using our data on order arrivals and placement decisions to make inferences about the traders' demand for liquidity and the cost of entering orders in the market. Our results show that liquidity demand is indeed time varying, and is related to several key observable measures of market characteristics. Furthermore, we find evidence of unexploited profit opportunities in the market, perhaps implying that traders do not continuously monitor the market for profitable trades. ...|$|R

40|$|It is a puzzling {{fact that}} many central banks choose to lend {{intra-day}} funds at an interest rate of zero (or very close to zero), while the interest rate on overnight funds is much higher.

40|$|Why do {{government}}s bailout banking {{systems in}} distress? We {{argue that the}} government can efficiently provide liquidity. We present a general equilibrium model in which not all assets can be used to purchase all other assets at every date. At some dates agents want to sell projects or securities. The only buyers are agents who have previously opportunistically invested in otherwise dominated assets because only these (“liquid”) assets can be used to purchase the projects or securities. The market price of the projects or securities sold depends on the supply of liquidity, which is determined in general equilibrium. The supply of liquidity is not perfectly elastic, so asset prices can deviate from “efficient market ” prices, that is, the conditional expectation of the asset payoff. While private liquidity provision is socially beneficial since it allows valuable reallocations, it is also socially costly since liquidity suppliers could have made more efficient investments ex ante. As a result, there is a potential role for the government <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>liquidity</b> by issuing government securities, backed by tax revenue.

Each fund manager receives imperfect information about the market’s ability <b>to</b> <b>supply</b> <b>liquidity</b> and chooses {{whether or not to}} sell the security based on her private information as well as the actions of others. Due to feedback effects the equilibrium is stochastic and the “aggregate action” is characterized by a power-law probability distribution with exponential truncation predicting occasional “explosive ” sell-out events. We examine highly disaggregated institutional ownership data of publicly traded stocks to find that stochastic herding explains the underlying data generating mechanism. Furthermore, consistent with market-timing considerations, the distribution parameter measuring the degree of herding rises sharply immediately prior the sell-out phase. The sell-out phase is consistent with the transition from subcritical to supercritical phase, whereby the system swings sharply to a new equilibrium. Specifically, exponential truncatio...|$|E
