5|$|Friction is {{a surface}} force that opposes {{relative}} motion. The frictional force {{is directly related}} to the normal force <b>that</b> <b>acts</b> to keep two solid objects separated at the point of contact. There are two broad classifications of frictional forces: static friction and kinetic friction.|$|E
5|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) is RNA {{that has}} a coding region <b>that</b> <b>acts</b> as a {{template}} for protein synthesis (translation). The rest of the mRNA, the untranslated regions, tune how active the mRNA is. There are also many RNAs that are not translated, called non-coding RNAs. Like the untranslated regions, many of these non-coding RNAs have regulatory roles.|$|E
5|$|Newton's Third Law is {{a result}} of {{applying}} symmetry to situations where forces {{can be attributed to the}} presence of different objects. The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies, and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force <b>that</b> <b>acts</b> on only one body.|$|E

5|$|The P90 is a {{selective}} fire, straight blowback-operated weapon with a cyclic {{rate of fire}} of 900 RPM (rounds per minute). The weapon is chambered for FN's 5.7×28mm ammunition. Its unusual shape is based on extensive ergonomic research. The weapon is grasped {{by means of a}} thumbhole in the frame <b>that</b> <b>acts</b> as a pistol grip, as well as an oversized trigger guard <b>that</b> <b>acts</b> as a foregrip for the shooter's support hand. The P90 fires from a closed bolt for maximum accuracy, and its design makes extensive use of polymers for reduced weight and cost. Overall, the weapon is relatively lightweight, weighing 2.5kg (5.6lb) empty, or 3kg (6.6lb) with a loaded 50-round magazine.|$|E
5|$|There are {{thousands}} of uses of various potassium compounds. One example is potassium superoxide, , an orange solid <b>that</b> <b>acts</b> as a portable source of oxygen and a carbon dioxide absorber. It is widely used in respiration systems in mines, submarines and spacecraft as it takes less volume than the gaseous oxygen.|$|E

5|$|For Kant a {{good will}} is a broader {{conception}} than a will which acts from duty. A will which acts from duty is distinguishable as a will which overcomes hindrances {{in order to}} keep the moral law. A dutiful will is thus a special case of a good will which becomes visible in adverse conditions. Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth. This is not to say <b>that</b> <b>acts</b> performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still deserve approval and encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the sufferings}} that some Indigenous {{children}} {{experienced in the}} Canadian Residential School system, the Holy Father expressed his sorrow at the anguish caused by the deplorable conduct of {{some members of the}} Church and he offered his sympathy and prayerful solidarity. His Holiness emphasized <b>that</b> <b>acts</b> of abuse cannot be tolerated in society.

5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are part}} of the body's {{integumentary}} system and serve to protect the body against germs. Sebaceous glands secrete acids that form the acid mantle. This is a very fine, slightly acidic film {{on the surface of the}} skin <b>that</b> <b>acts</b> as a barrier to bacteria, viruses, and other potential contaminants that might penetrate the skin. The pH of the skin is between 4.5 and 6.2, and this acidity helps to neutralise the primarily alkaline nature of contaminants.|$|E

5|$|Spiders a {{class of}} arachnids have four pairs of legs; a body of two segments—a {{cephalothorax}} and an abdomen. Spiders have no wings and no antennae. They have mouthparts called chelicerae which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous. They have a second pair of appendages called pedipalps attached to the cephalothorax. These have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs. At {{the end of each}} male pedipalp is a spoon-shaped cymbium <b>that</b> <b>acts</b> to support the copulatory organ.|$|E

5|$|The {{normal force}} {{is due to}} repulsive forces of {{interaction}} between atoms at close contact. When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force <b>that</b> <b>acts</b> in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects. The normal force, for example, {{is responsible for the}} structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object. An example of the normal force in action is the impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{strong force}} only acts {{directly}} upon elementary particles. However, a residual {{of the force}} is observed between hadrons (the best known example being the force <b>that</b> <b>acts</b> between nucleons in atomic nuclei) as the nuclear force. Here the strong force acts indirectly, transmitted as gluons, which form part of the virtual pi and rho mesons, which classically transmit the nuclear force (see this topic for more). The failure of many searches for free quarks {{has shown that the}} elementary particles affected are not directly observable. This phenomenon is called color confinement.|$|E
5|$|This {{increase}} in permeability primarily affects transport of ions and other hydrated species, {{indicating that the}} mechanism {{is the creation of}} nm-scale water-filled holes in the membrane. Although electroporation and dielectric breakdown both result from application of an electric field, the mechanisms involved are fundamentally different. In dielectric breakdown the barrier material is ionized, creating a conductive pathway. The material alteration is thus chemical in nature. In contrast, during electroporation the lipid molecules are not chemically altered but simply shift position, opening up a pore <b>that</b> <b>acts</b> as the conductive pathway through the bilayer as it is filled with water.|$|E

5|$|A common Palestinian dessert {{reserved}} {{only for}} Ramadan is qatayef, {{which could be}} provided by the numerous street vendors in several major Palestinian cities or towns as well as typical Palestinian households. Qatayef is the general name of the dessert as a whole, but more specifically, the name of the batter <b>that</b> <b>acts</b> as a base. The result of the batter being poured into a round hot plate appears similar to pancakes, except only one side is cooked, then folded. The pastry is filled with either unsalted goat cheese or ground walnuts and cinnamon. It is then baked and served with a hot sugar-water syrup or sometimes honey.|$|E
5|$|A {{conservative}} force <b>that</b> <b>acts</b> on {{a closed}} system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms. This means {{that for a}} closed system, the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system. The force, therefore, is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space, and can {{be considered to be}} an artifact of the potential field {{in the same way that}} the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area.|$|E
5|$|A vitamin is {{an organic}} {{compound}} needed in small quantities that cannot {{be made in}} cells. In human nutrition, most vitamins function as coenzymes after modification; for example, all water-soluble vitamins are phosphorylated or are coupled to nucleotides when they are used in cells. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a derivative of vitamin B3 (niacin), is an important coenzyme <b>that</b> <b>acts</b> as a hydrogen acceptor. Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD+ into NADH. This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate {{for any of the}} reductases in the cell that need to reduce their substrates. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell, NADH and NADPH. The NAD+/NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions, while NADP+/NADPH is used in anabolic reactions.|$|E
