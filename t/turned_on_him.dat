5|$|By {{the time}} the Detours had become the Who, they had already found regular gigs, {{including}} at the Oldfield Hotel in Greenford, the White Hart Hotel in Acton, the Goldhawk Social Club in Shepherd's Bush, and the Notre Dame Hall in Leicester Square. They had also replaced Druce as manager with Helmut Gorden, with whom they secured an audition with Chris Parmeinter for Fontana Records. Parmeinter found problems with the drumming and, according to Sandom, Townshend immediately <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> and threatened to fire him if his playing did not immediately improve. Sandom left in disgust, but was persuaded to lend his kit to any potential stand-ins or replacements. Sandom and Townshend did not {{speak to each other}} again for 14 years.|$|E
5|$|In early August, ROH, in storyline, {{suspended}} Benjamin {{for attacking}} Titus and several ROH officials with a steel chair. The suspension {{was used to}} explain Benjamin's absence from ROH, while he was working in Japan. Benjamin returned on September 15 at , accompanying Charlie Haas and Rhett Titus during their tag team championship tournament matches. On December 16 at , Benjamin and Haas defeated Titus and B.J. Whitmer in a Street Fight. The following day {{it was reported that}} Benjamin had requested and received a release from his ROH contract. Benjamin made one more appearance for ROH on February 2, 2013, when Haas <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> during an ROH World Tag Team Championship match against the Briscoe Brothers. Benjamin was scheduled to face Haas on April 5 at Supercard of Honor VII, but after Haas had parted ways with the promotion, he was replaced by Mike Bennett, who went on to defeat Benjamin.|$|E
5|$|In November 2006, Kennedy {{joined forces}} with Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in matches against The Brothers of Destruction (Undertaker and Kane) in various combinations. On a November episode of SmackDown!, Kennedy and MVP lost to the Brothers of Destruction three times. After first getting counted out, Theodore Long {{restarted}} the match with no countouts. When they disqualified themselves following a low blow by Kennedy, Long restarted the match again with no countouts and no disqualifications. Kennedy and MVP continued to feud with the brothers, with MVP feuding with Kane while Kennedy challenged the Undertaker to a match at Survivor Series, which was later announced as a First Blood match. Kennedy won the match after MVP <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> and aimed for {{his head with a}} steel chair, but missed and hit the Undertaker instead, leaving him bleeding. After the match, the Undertaker attacked Kennedy, forcing him to bleed. At Armageddon, Kennedy and the Undertaker met in a final match; they were scheduled in a Last Ride match. In the match, the Undertaker defeated Kennedy.|$|E

5|$|Abu'l-Aswar or Abu'l-Asvar Shavur ibn Fadl ibn Muhammad ibn Shaddad was {{a member}} of the Shaddadid dynasty. Between 1049 and 1067 he was the eighth Shaddadid ruler of Arran (today in western Azerbaijan) from Ganja. Prior to that, he ruled the city of Dvin (in what is now Armenia and northeastern Turkey) from 1022 as an {{autonomous}} lord. A capable warrior, and a wise and cunning ruler, Abu'l-Aswar was engaged in several conflicts with most of his neighbours. During his rule over Dvin, he was mostly involved in the affairs of the Armenian principalities. He collaborated with the Byzantine Empire in its conquest of the last remnants of Bagratid Armenia in 1045, but when the Byzantines later <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him,</b> he survived three successive offensives that sought to take Ganja. In 1049, a revolt in Ganja overthrew his infant great-great-nephew, Anurshirvan. The rebels invited him to take up the family's emirate, and he moved from Dvin to Ganja. Under his rule, the Shaddadid dynasty reached its zenith. He undertook successful campaigns into Georgia and Shirvan, although the limits of Shaddadid power were exposed by his failure to take over the Emirate of Tiflis and by devastating raids by the Alans. At the same time, his reign witnessed the rapid rise of the Seljuk Empire and the extension of its control over the Transcaucasian principalities. Abu'l-Aswar became a Seljuk vassal in 1054/5. Although he gained control over the former Armenian capital of Ani through Seljuk patronage in 1065, this association also paved the way for the dynasty's decline after his death in November 1067.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Los Infernales won the Mexican National Trios Championship in Guadalajara, Jalisco {{and began}} feuding with La Familia de Tijuana (Nicho el Millonario, Halloween, and Damián 666). The trio lost the {{championship}} to La Familia in September 2002 but continued feuding {{with the group}} into 2003. Over the summer of 2003 Los Infernales won a tournament to become the number one contenders for the CMLL World Trios Championship but lost champions Black Tiger III, Dr. Wagner, Jr., and Universo 2000 on August 1. At {{the end of the}} year, Averno and Mephisto turned on El Satánico, but there was no major storyline feud between the three afterwards. In September 2004, Averno defeated Zumbido to win the vacant NWA World Middleweight Championship. Shortly after the championship win Averno was positioned as a rival or foil to the up-and-coming tecnico Místico. Averno and Mephisto also became de facto members of Los Guerreros del Infierno, joining forces with their former rivals. In February 2005, Averno lost the NWA World Middleweight Championship to Místico as part of their long running storyline. Two months later Averno and Mephisto defeated Atlantis and Blue Panther to win the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. When Shinsuke Nakamura and Hiroshi Tanahashi from New Japan Pro Wrestling came to CMLL, Averno initially teamed up with them, the two <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him.</b> This led to a trios match with Averno, Último Guerrero and Rey Bucanero defeating Nakamura, Tanahashi, and Shigeo Okumura in one of the featured bouts on the CMLL 72nd Anniversary Show. In early 2006 Averno and Mephisto were the catalyst for one of CMLL's big storylines as they defended their titles against Místico and Black Warrior twice. In the first match, they won by disqualification when Black Warrior interfered in the match after already being eliminated and in the second match Black Warrior turned on Místico, attacking his partner to end the match. In April 2006, they lost the tag team championship to Místico and Negro Casas, ending their 377-day-long reign.|$|E

25|$|Ron Suart's {{tenure as}} manager looked in some danger. The Blackpool fans had now <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him,</b> {{especially}} after a 6–2 defeat at Second Division Scunthorpe United in the FA Cup. A home attendance fell below 10,000 {{for the first}} time in over fifteen years, the visit of Leicester City on 17 December 1960. Suart rode out the storm, however, and continued to rebuild the side as he saw fit.|$|E
25|$|Flair {{began making}} more {{frequent}} appearances with Charlotte after {{she won the}} Divas Championship. In January 2016, Flair and Charlotte began displaying villainous traits, with Flair often getting involved in Charlotte's Divas Championship and later WWE Women's Championship defenses. This lasted until the May 23, 2016 episode of Raw, when Charlotte <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him.</b> On the November 28, 2016 episode of Raw, Flair returned to congratulate the new Raw Women's Champion Sasha Banks, who had defeated Charlotte to win the title.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1994, Lawler {{initiated}} a feud with Doink the Clown. Lawler popped the balloons carried by Doink's midget sidekick, Dink. After Doink and Dink retaliated, Lawler introduced a midget sidekick of his own, who he named Queasy. In the following weeks, Doink added two more sidekicks, Wink and Pink, while Lawler introduced Sleazy and Cheesy. This led to an elimination match at Survivor Series 1994, which Lawler's team won. After the match, however, Lawler's team <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him,</b> joining with Doink's team to attack Lawler.|$|E

However, on December 8 at Guerra de Titanes, Aguayo, Daga and Psicosis revealed they had played Cibernético, when Aguayo <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> and brought Los Perros del Mal back under the umbrella of the reformed La Sociedad. On August 2, 2014, AAA announced that Castellanos was released from AAA.|$|E
25|$|After WrestleMania, The Dudley Boyz began a {{feud with}} The Holly Cousins. During this time, Dudley began a {{relationship}} with Molly Holly, {{which led to the}} Dudleys turning on him and putting Holly through a table. On June 14, 2001, Dudley was given his first opportunity at a World Heavyweight Championship, in a losing effort against Stone Cold Steve Austin. During The Invasion, Dudley remained loyal to WWF, despite being an ECW Original. It was during The Invasion that his relationship with Molly came to an end when she <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him,</b> aligning herself with The Alliance.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} was an over 30 minute bout between Ric Flair and Lex Luger for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. They were once {{members of the}} Four Horsemen stable, but Luger began to have issues with the other members, and left the group. Luger started a feud with Flair when Barry Windham, a friend of Luger's, <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him,</b> and joined the Four Horsemen. Other matches {{included}} The Road Warriors against Sting and Dusty Rhodes for the NWA World Tag Team Championship, Barry Windham against Bam Bam Bigelow for the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship, and Mike Rotunda against Rick Steiner for the NWA World Television Championship.|$|E

25|$|Although {{conventional}} wisdom {{holds that the}} Hell in a Cell match was responsible for Foley's rise to main event status, live television crowds did not initially get behind Mankind because of the match. Following a summer where he teamed with Kane to win the WWF Tag Team Championship on two separate occasions, Foley decided that crowds might respond better if Mankind were more of a comedy character, and so he abandoned the tortured soul characteristics and became more of a goofy, broken down oaf. He began the transition into this character following SummerSlam in 1998, after Kane <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> and the two lost the tag team championships.|$|E
25|$|The {{first real}} setback with the Horsemen {{occurred}} at Starrcade 1986 after Anderson and Ole lost a Steel Cage match to The Rock 'n' Roll Express, with Ole getting pinned. The subsequent storyline positioned Ole as the weak link within the team, possibly attributed to his age. Ole's {{position with the}} group was only further weakened after {{he decided to take}} two months off after Starrcade. After Ole's return in February 1987, the other Horsemen <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> and threw him out of the group, resulting in Ole incurring numerous attacks over the next several months. Afterwards, Ole was replaced with Lex Luger and the Horsemen resumed their dominance of the company.|$|E
25|$|Following Mark Henry's ECW Championship win at Night of Champions, Dreamer {{was named}} his first challenger. At The Great American Bash, Dreamer was {{defeated}} by Henry for the championship after Colin Delaney <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> and cost him the match. On the following ECW, Dreamer defeated Delaney and again on August 12, 2008 in an Extreme Rules Grudge Match which would be Delaney's final match in the WWE. Dreamer then {{turned his attention to}} Jack Swagger, who made disparaging remarks about Dreamer and ECW. They first faced off in an amateur wrestling match, which Dreamer was disqualified from for using his DDT on Swagger. Then Swagger defeated Dreamer in an Extreme rules match, ending the feud.|$|E

25|$|Throughout 1999, {{the members}} {{gradually}} turned on one another. Initially, Chyna turned on Triple H {{and joined the}} Corporation on January 25. At WrestleMania XV Chyna turned on then fellow Corporation member Kane, helping Triple H to defeat him. Later that night, Triple H and Chyna interfered in X-Pac's European Championship match with Shane McMahon. Initially, it appeared {{they were there to}} help X-Pac, but Triple H quickly <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him,</b> delivering a Pedigree to his former stablemate, costing him the match. Chyna and Triple H would then join The Corporation, with Kane being ousted. As a result, X-Pac began to share a bond with Kane, which resulted in Kane becoming associated with the faction and the duo holding the WWF Tag Team Championship twice.|$|E
25|$|At SummerSlam, The Undertaker {{returned}} to confront Kane and Rey Mysterio, {{only to be}} attacked with a Tombstone Piledriver by Kane. With Kane revealed as his attacker, the two feuded {{for the next few}} months over the World Heavyweight Championship. After losing to Kane at Night of Champions, Paul Bearer returned as Undertaker's manager on an episode of SmackDown. However, Bearer <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> at Hell in a Cell to help Kane win once again. The feud ended at Bragging Rights when The Nexus helped Kane defeat Undertaker in a Buried Alive match. Undertaker was originally booked to beat Kane for the title at Bragging Rights, but he needed surgery for a torn rotator cuff, causing him to be written off.|$|E
25|$|Debuting on October 18, 1985, Rude {{jumped to}} World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) along with Pringle, where he feuded with Kevin Von Erich and Chris Adams. During {{his time in}} WCCW, Rude {{captured}} the NWA American Heavyweight Championship on November 4, 1985. However, WCCW withdrew from the NWA on February 20, 1986, and {{changed its name to}} the World Class Wrestling Association. The NWA American Championship was renamed the WCWA World Heavyweight Championship while Rude was still holding the title. As a result, Rude became the promotion's first world champion. After losing the title to Chris Adams in July 1986, he fired Pringle and briefly replaced him with his sister, Raven. He formed a short-lived tag team with The Dingo Warrior, but the Warrior <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>him</b> and became a face.|$|E
