25|$|The {{ruling is}} controversial. Representatives of the US ethanol {{industry}} complained that this rule overstates the {{environmental effects of}} corn ethanol, and also criticized the inclusion of indirect effects of land-use changes as an unfair penalty to home-made corn ethanol because deforestation {{in the developing world}} is being tied to US ethanol production. The initial reference value set for 2011 for LCFS means that Mid-west corn ethanol will not meet the California standard unless current carbon intensity is reduced. Oil industry representatives complained that there is a cost associated to the new standard, as the LCFS will limit the use of corn ethanol blended in gasoline, thus leaving oil refiners with few available and viable options, such as sugarcane ethanol from Brazil, but this option means paying costly U.S. import tariffs. CARB officials and environmentalists reject such scenario because they think <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time and economic incentive to developed inexpensive biofuels, hydrogen-based fuels, even ethanol from such cellulosic materials, or new ways to make ethanol out of corn with a smaller carbon footprint.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for Salon magazine, Andrew O'Hehir wrote, [...] "What Soderbergh {{has sought to}} capture here is a grand process of birth and extinguishment, one that {{produced}} a complicated legacy in which John McCain, Barack Obama, and Raúl Castro are still enmeshed. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time to argue about the film's (or films') political relevance or lack thereof, to call Soderbergh names for this or that historical omission, for this or that ideological error. He's made something that people will be eager to see and eager {{to talk about all}} over the world, something that feels strangely urgent, something messy and unfinished and amazing".|$|E
2500|$|At The Guardian, Sam Jordison {{called it}} [...] "as complicated, daft, hilarious and {{satisfying}} as vintage PG Wodehouse: part kung fu epic, part philosophical novel, part mind-bending experiment with chaos theory (and a piss-take {{of those three}} things)", and categorized it as a book to [...] "give (readers) hope". At the SF Site, Steven H Silver observed that the book's parodying of action films is [...] "masterful", and commended Pratchett for how [...] "fresh" [...] the humor was—while conceding that [...] "reader(s) may not laugh out loud ... but <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> internal chuckling".|$|E

6000|$|... "Here," [...] {{answered}} the king, handing the counselor the leathern purse. [...] "It {{is all in}} silver quarters, {{and they must be}} taken from the purse one at a time; but <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> to pay your demands, and to spare." ...|$|R
2500|$|Wyndham's {{performance}} was praised, {{and the play}} must have generated considerable interest: [...] On 24 December, the drama critic of The Illustrated London News had not yet seen the play, but had heard that the play was [...] "brilliantly successful, and will probably have a very long run; so <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> <b>of</b> time to criticise it at leisure after the feverish pantomimic Boxing-Night week. I hear the Fairy spoken of on all sides {{as one of the}} wittiest and as the most ingenious and daring of Mr Gilbert's dramatic productions." [...] Unfortunately, he never published his review – Fogerty's Fairy closed on 6 January 1882, before the next edition of his weekly paper. [...] It was not a success, playing only about 25 performances.|$|E

[...] "I {{shall never}} {{go outside the}} English land, again. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> to do, and a great trade on the river; {{everyone}} <b>will</b> <b>be</b> happy and contented.

6000|$|... "You {{need not}} fear for me. I am tough, and growing used to troubles. What {{was it you}} said? Oh! tea. Thank you; that reminds me. Will you come and have dinner with me to-morrow after church? It is Christmas Day, you know.

6000|$|... "Very sad indeed," [...] {{answered}} the mother absently; [...] "but {{if he is}} a Jew, what does it matter? He has a title, and they say that he is enormously rich. I expect <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> going on at Outram soon.

60|$|I {{really could}} not go on seriously last night. The idea of Aunt Janet giving me a licking as in the dear old days made me laugh so much that {{nothing in the world}} seemed serious then. Oh, Aunt Janet is all right {{whatever}} comes. That I am sure of, so I needn't worry over it. A good thing too; <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> to worry about without that.

"O Priest," [...] {{answered}} the chief with a deprecatory gesture, [...] "when first we saw you we hoped {{that it would}} be the white man and yourself, for we have never tasted white man.

5000|$|At first Sage {{considered}} {{removal of}} his mill at Bell Ewart {{to a site}} near {{the confluence of the}} two rivers. Lumber from there would still have to be transported to the Northern Railway at Bell Ewart.

In a letter to Thompson Smith, Sage wrote: [...] "with the canal built <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> to do, without it I think business <b>will</b> <b>be</b> limited." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{know the}} lingo, lad, and might get into trouble. You see, {{there are always}} sailors going ashore from our ships of war, and they get drunk and have sprees; and I don't fancy they are favourites with the lower class, here, {{although}} the shopkeepers, of course, are glad enough to have their money--but I don't {{think it would be}} safe for a lad like you, who can't speak a word of the language, to wander about outside the regular streets. <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>plenty</b> for you to see, without going further." ...|$|R
