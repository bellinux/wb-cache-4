5|$|Arafat's {{ability to}} adapt to new {{tactical}} and political situations was perhaps tested {{by the rise of}} <b>the</b> <b>Hamas</b> and PIJ organizations, Islamist groups espousing rejectionist policies with Israel. These groups often bombed non-military targets, such as malls and movie theaters, to increase the psychological damage and civilian casualties. In the 1990s, these groups seemed to threaten Arafat's capacity to hold together a unified nationalist organization with a goal of statehood.|$|E

Following the killings of Macadma and Salah Shehadeh, Rantisi purportedly became the political head and also acclaimed spiritual leader of Hamas, remaining its principal spokesman.|$|E

5000|$|Aspersions {{have been}} cast by {{journalist}} Steven Erlanger, former Jerusalem {{bureau chief of}} the New York Times, who described the IUG as [...] "one of the prime means for Hamas to convert Palestinians to its Islamist cause," [...] in a 2007 article about further Israeli airstrikes on the university. However, this report was criticised by political economist Sara Roy of Harvard University, who explicitly stated that 'there can be no question that Hamas works within the framework of Islamic institutions in the Gaza Strip, and that there are certain direct links between Hamas and many of the social and economic institutions (in the strip). ... However, it is far more questionable whether an automatic and inevitable link exists between Hamas and Islamic social and economic institutions, whether those links are inherently subversive, or whether such institutions promote radicalism and violence as is commonly assumed." [...] Roy also writes: [...] "logic maintains, institutional clients become automatically linked to Hamas and constitute a base of support for political Islam. As a result, Islamic social institutions become recruiting centers for <b>the</b> <b>Hamas's</b> military wing. There is however, little hard evidence to support any of these allegations.|$|R

40|$|This {{monograph}} {{considers the}} changing fortunes of <b>the</b> Palestinian movement, <b>HAMAS,</b> and <b>the</b> recent outcomes of Israeli strategies aimed against this group and Palestinian nationalism {{external to the}} Fatah faction of the Palestinian Authority. <b>The</b> example of <b>HAMAS</b> challenges much of the current wisdom on "insurgencies" and their containment.

It is important to consider this Islamist movement {{in the context of a}} region-wide phenomenon of similar movements with local goals, which can be persuaded to relinquish violence, or which could move in the opposite direction, becoming more violent.

However, Deif remains its official head. According to Hamas political leader Ayman Taha, since Jabari took over the al-Qassam Brigades' day-to-day operations, Hamas's armed wing became increasingly professional. During the course of the Intifada, he directed several attacks against Israel, including suicide bombings, that resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Israeli civilians and soldiers.|$|R
5000|$|According to John I.

An example of the biblical view of this kind of human violence is found in Psalm 73, which identifies the [...] "wicked" [...] as violent people who deny God's demand for, and attention to, justice (v. 11).|$|R
