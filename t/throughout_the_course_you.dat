5000|$|On May 21, 2015, {{following}} UT's Big Orange Caravan stop at Nissan Stadium, Coach Jones stated [...] "We just can't {{be a year}} older. We {{have to be a}} year better, and that's part of {{that growth}} and that development." [...] He added, [...] "We'll still be exceptionally young in the defensive front. We're going to rely on two true freshman defensive tackles (Kahlil McKenzie and Shy Tuttle) to really play a big part in this year's outcome of many games, so we have to get them ready to go. But our older players have done a great job of mentoring the young players coming in. On the offensive front, we had some individuals who gained some valuable experience. You could see that kind of manifesting itself <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> of spring. <b>You</b> could see that confidence. You could see a change in strength levels. You could see a change in maturity, and also just in football knowledge." ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} whether angiopoietin- 2, von Willebrand factor (VWF) and angiopoietin- 1 relate to surrogate indicators of vascular permeability, pulmonary dysfunction and {{intensive care unit}} (ICU) mortality <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> of septic shock. METHODS: In 50 consecutive mechanically ventilated septic shock patients, plasma angiopoietin- 2, VWF and angiopoietin- 1 levels and fluid balance, partial pressure of oxygen/inspiratory oxygen fraction and the oxygenation index as indicators of vascular permeability and pulmonary dysfunction, respectively, were measured until day 28. RESULTS: Angiopoietin- 2 positively related to the fluid balance and pulmonary dysfunction, was higher in non-survivors than in survivors and independently predicted non-survival <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> of septic shock. VWF inversely related to the fluid balance and pulmonary dysfunction <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> of septic shock, was comparable between survivors and non-survivors and predicted non-survival on day 0 only. Angiopoietin- 1 positively related to pulmonary dysfunction <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>course,</b> but did not differ between survivors and non-survivors. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to VWF, plasma angiopoietin- 2 positively relates to fluid balance, pulmonary dysfunction and mortality <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> of septic shock, in line with a suggested mediator role of the protein...|$|R
