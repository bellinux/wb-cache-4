5|$|Although Mazariegos {{had managed}} to {{establish}} his new provincial capital without armed conflict, excessive Spanish demands for labour and supplies soon provoked the locals into rebellion. In August 1528, Mazariegos replaced the existing encomenderos with his friends and allies; the natives, seeing the Spanish isolated and witnessing the hostility between the original and newly arrived settlers, took <b>this</b> <b>opportunity</b> to rebel and refused to supply their new masters. Zinacantán was the only indigenous settlement that remained loyal to the Spanish.|$|E

50|$|By {{the modern}} era, wars had become large and complex endeavors. Battlefields might contain troops under several {{different}} commanders, and tactical deceptions could have unexpected effects. Because of <b>this,</b> <b>opportunities</b> {{for an individual}} to undertake military deception declined. Throughout the First World War deception began to shift to the strategic planners higher up the chain of command, and during the Second World War deception planning departments sprung up {{in all of the}} major theaters.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} these changes had little practical effect, possibly due to opposition by the planners and confusion or fear among cadres. From 1981–84 agricultural production grew substantially, {{but the government}} did not use <b>this</b> <b>opportunity</b> to increase production of such crucial farm inputs as fertilizer, pesticide and fuel, nor of consumer goods. By the end of Lê Duẩn's rule, in 1985–1986, inflation had reached over 100% annually, complicating economic policy-making.|$|E
5|$|At this moment, {{having failed}} twice {{to make a}} breakthrough, Marlborough {{received}} intelligence that the defences linking the town walls with the breastwork on the hill were now sparsely manned (Marlborough's unsuccessful attacks had drawn d'Arco's men away {{from other parts of}} the stronghold, leaving his left flank almost defenceless and highly vulnerable). The other Allied commander, the Margrave of Baden (who had entered the battle half an hour after Marlborough), also noticed <b>this</b> <b>opportunity</b> and was soon hurrying with his grenadiers from the hamlet of Berg, and across the Kaibach stream to assault the position.|$|E
5|$|Batista {{had come}} under {{increasing}} pressure by 1958. His army's military failures, coupled with his press censorship {{and the police}} and army's use of torture and extrajudicial executions, were increasingly criticized both domestically and abroad. Influenced by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the U.S. government ceased supplying him with weaponry, leading him to buy arms from the United Kingdom. The opposition used <b>this</b> <b>opportunity</b> to call a general strike, accompanied by armed attacks from the MR-26-7. Beginning on 9 April, it received strong support {{in central and eastern}} Cuba, but little elsewhere.|$|E

Even so, the government and navy, fueled by anger over their lost honor, used <b>this</b> <b>opportunity</b> to round up the remaining amnestied sailors and put them in prison.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the very common {{situation in which}} a single-period 'newsboy' type product may be ordered or produced twice during a season/period. We show that the explicit consideration of <b>this</b> reorder <b>opportunity</b> makes the newsboy problem very much richer. The specific version considered in this paper allows a reorder during mid-season after the early-season demand has been observed, and this reorder arrives after a given lead time. The demand distributions during the various portions of the season may have very general distribution forms; also, the late-season and early-season demands may be dependent. Solution procedures are developed {{to find the best}} way to exploit <b>this</b> reorder <b>opportunity,</b> and our numerical solutions indicate that <b>this</b> reorder <b>opportunity</b> can improve profits considerably as long as the product's profit margin is not very high. Other real-world variations of this two-order newsboy problem are briefly discussed. © 1997 Elsevier Science B. V. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
