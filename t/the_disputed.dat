40|$|<b>Dispute</b> Settlement in <b>the</b> WTO Veronika Honzíková Abstract <b>The</b> WTO <b>dispute</b> {{settlement}} {{represents a}} significant improvement compared to <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> settlement system under GATT 1947, but is still considered as his successor. The mechanism under GATT 1947 had many weaknesses which resulted to the need of reform. The procedure under GATT 1947 was not contradictory and all members of <b>the</b> <b>Dispute</b> Settlement Body (DSB) were entitled to use the veto right when adopting the reports. The contracting parties were conscious of such weaknesses and they have agreed on a new dispute settlement system during the Uruguay round. <b>The</b> <b>Dispute</b> Settlement Understanding (DSU) {{is part of the}} Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization. The new system remains inter-state mechanism and as a consequence, available only to the Member States, excluding individuals and business operators. <b>The</b> <b>dispute</b> settlement under WTO has become compulsory while leaving each member the choice between this standard procedure and other dispute modes, such as Good Offices, Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. <b>The</b> <b>dispute</b> settlement system has been unified and has become more judicial. It excludes national jurisdictions and means strengthening <b>the</b> multilateralism. <b>The</b> <b>dispute</b> settlement is administrated by <b>the</b> <b>Dispute</b> Settlement Body, [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Sitting in Paris, the Tribunal of Arbitration {{finalized}} {{its decision}} on 3 October 1899. The award was unanimous, but gave no {{reasons for the}} decision, merely describing the resulting boundary, which gave Britain almost 90% of <b>the</b> <b>disputed</b> territory. The Schomburgk Line was, with small deviations, re-established as the border between British Guiana and Venezuela. The first deviation from the Schomburgk line was that Venezuela's territory included Barima Point {{at the mouth of}} the Orinoco, giving it undisputed control of the river, and thus the ability to levy duties on Venezuelan commerce. The second was drawing the border at the Wenamu River rather than the Cuyuni River, giving Venezuela a substantial territory east of the line – territory which Britain had originally refused to include in the arbitration.

40|$|Paradoxically, {{the ending}} of <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> between <b>the</b> National Union of Mineworkers and the National Coal Board has raised several {{questions}} and potential problems rather than led to any enduring solutions. The ending of <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> without an agreement, the high numbers of miners applying for voluntary redundancy, and the recent acceptance of the 5. 2 % wage offer refused eighteen months ago, all prompt a questioning of the causes and consequences of <b>the</b> <b>dispute.</b> <b>The</b> conduct and ending of <b>the</b> <b>dispute</b> also raise {{a number of important}} issues as to the future pattern of industrial relations within the mining industry and in Britain generally.

5|$|In July 2003 Rambhadracharya deposed as {{an expert}} witness for {{religious}} matters (OPW 16) in Other Original Suit Number5 of the Ram Janmabhoomi Babri Masjid dispute case in the Allahabad High Court. Some portions of his affidavit and cross examination are quoted in the final judgement by the High Court. In his affidavit, he cited the ancient Hindu scriptures including the Ramayana, Rāmatāpanīya Upaniṣad, Skanda Purana, Yajurveda, Atharvaveda, and others describing Ayodhya as a city holy to Hindus and the birthplace of Rama. He cited verses from two works composed by Tulsidas which, in his opinion, {{are relevant to the}} dispute. The first citation consisted of eight verses from a work called Dohā Śataka, which describe the destruction of a temple and construction of a mosque at <b>the</b> <b>disputed</b> site in 1528CE by Mughal ruler Babur, who had ordered General Mir Baqui to destroy the Rama temple, considered a symbol of worship by infidels. The second citation was a verse from a work called Kavitāvalī, which mentions a mosque. In his cross examination, he described in some detail the history of the Ramananda sect, its Mathas, rules regarding Mahants, formation and working of Akharas, and Tulsidas' works. Refuting the possibility of the original temple being to the north of <b>the</b> <b>disputed</b> area, as pleaded by the pro-mosque parties, he described the boundaries of the Janmabhoomi as mentioned in the Ayodhya Mahatmya section of Skanda Purana, which tallied with the present location of <b>the</b> <b>disputed</b> area, as noted by Justice Sudhir Agarwal. However, he stated that he had no knowledge of whether there was a Ram Chabootra ("Platform of Rama") outside the area that was locked from 1950 to 1985 and where the Chati Poojan Sthal was, nor whether the idols of Rama, his brother Lakshmana, and Sita were installed at Ram Chabootra outside the Janmabhoomi temple.|$|E

5|$|King Charles IV of Spain ordered data {{compiled}} {{to determine}} the true boundary.

At the end of 1806, local commanders negotiated a temporary agreement in which neither the Spanish nor the Americans would venture into the area between the Sabine River and Arroyo Hondo. This neutral ground quickly became a haven for lawlessness and it did not stop individuals from crossing the boundary.
