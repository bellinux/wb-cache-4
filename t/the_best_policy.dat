40|$|Abstract. An optimal probabilistic-planning {{algorithm}} solves a prob-lem, usually modeled by a Markov decision process, {{by finding}} its optimal policy. In this paper, we study <b>the</b> k <b>best</b> <b>policies</b> problem. <b>The</b> prob-lem {{is to find}} <b>the</b> k <b>best</b> <b>policies.</b> <b>The</b> k <b>best</b> <b>policies,</b> k> 1, cannot be found directly using dynamic programming. Näıvely, finding <b>the</b> k-th <b>best</b> <b>policy</b> can be Turing reduced to the optimal planning problem, {{but the number of}} problems queried in the näıve algorithm is exponential in k. We show empirically that solving k <b>best</b> <b>policy</b> problem by using this reduction requires unreasonable amounts of time even when k = 3. We then provide a new algorithm, based on our theoretical contribution to prove that <b>the</b> k-th <b>best</b> <b>policy</b> differs from <b>the</b> i-th policy, for some i < k, on exactly one state. We show that the time complexity of the algorithm is quadratic in k, but the number of optimal planning prob-lems it solves is linear in k. We demonstrate empirically that the new algorithm has good scalability. ...|$|R

Many {{of the issues that}} are settled within the scientific community, such as human responsibility for global warming, remain the subject of politically or economically motivated attempts to downplay, dismiss or deny them—an ideological phenomenon categorised by academics and scientists as climate change denial. The sources of funding for those involved with climate science—both supporting and opposing mainstream scientific positions—have been questioned by both sides. There are debates about <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>policy</b> responses to the science, their cost-effectiveness and their urgency. Climate scientists, especially in the United States, have reported official and oil-industry pressure to censor or suppress their work and hide scientific data, with directives not to discuss the subject in public communications. Legal cases regarding global warming, its effects, and measures to reduce it have reached American courts. The fossil fuels lobby has been identified as overtly or covertly supporting efforts to undermine or discredit the scientific consensus on global warming.|$|E
40|$|Why do elected {{officials}} often suffer from political paralysis {{and fail to}} implement <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>policies</b> available? This paper considers a new yet intuitive explanation {{that focuses on the}} quality of the politicians competing to replace the incumbent. The key insight is that a ‘good’ incumbent with preferences identical to those of a representative voter will want to keep corrupt politicians out of office; she may do so by distorting her policy choices to signal her type and win re-election. The value of signalling and staying in office increases with the fraction of corrupt types in the population of politicians. Electing good types may therefore not be enough to ensure that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>policies</b> are implemented, especially when corrupt politicians are common. This provides a new explanation for why political failure is particularly severe in corrupt democracies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} work on piggyback cache validation (PCV), which {{addresses the}} problem of maintaining cache coherency for proxy caches. The novel aspect of our approach is to capitalize on requests sent from the proxy cache to the server to improve coherency. In the simplest case, whenever a proxy cache has a reason to communicate with a server it piggybacks a list of cached, but potentially stale, resources from that server for validation. Trace-driven simulation of this mechanism on two large, independent data sets shows that PCV both provides stronger cache coherency and reduces the request traffic {{in comparison to the}} time-to-live (TTL) based techniques currently used. Specifically, in comparison to <b>the</b> <b>best</b> TTL-based <b>policy,</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> PCV-based <b>policy</b> reduces <b>the</b> number of request messages from a proxy cache to a server by 16 - 17 % and the average cost (considering response latency, request messages and bandwidth) by 6 - 8 %.

2500|$|Over the {{industrial}} revolution, English courts {{became more and}} more wedded to the concept of [...] "freedom of contract". It was partly a sign of progress, as the vestiges of feudal and mercantile restrictions on workers and businesses were lifted, a move of people (at least in theory) from [...] "status to contract". On the other hand, a preference for laissez faire thought concealed the inequality of bargaining power in multiple contracts, particularly for employment, consumer goods and services, and tenancies. At the centre of the general law of contracts, captured in nursery rhymes like Robert Browning's Pied Piper of Hamelin in 1842, was the fabled notion that if people had promised something [...] "let us keep our promise". But then, the law purported to cover every form of agreement, as if everybody had the same degree of free will to promise what they wanted. Though many of the most influential liberal thinkers, especially John Stuart Mill, believed in multiple exceptions to the rule that laissez faire was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>policy,</b> the courts were suspicious of interfering in agreements, whoever the parties were. In Printing and Numerical Registering Co v Sampson Sir George Jessel MR proclaimed it a [...] "public policy" [...] that [...] "contracts when entered into freely and voluntarily shall be held sacred and shall be enforced by Courts of justice." [...] The same year, the Judicature Act 1875 merged the Courts of Chancery and common law, with equitable principles (such as estoppel, undue influence, rescission for misrepresentation and fiduciary duties or disclosure requirements in some transactions) always taking precedence.|$|E
