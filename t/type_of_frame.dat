60|$|The door of {{the house}} is open, and an elderly woman is looking out; but she is not placidly contemplating the evening sunshine; she has been {{watching}} with dim eyes the gradually enlarging speck which for the last few minutes she has been quite sure is her darling son Adam. Lisbeth Bede loves her son with the love of a woman to whom her first-born has come late in life. She is an anxious, spare, yet vigorous old woman, clean as a snowdrop. Her grey hair is turned neatly back under a pure linen cap with a black band round it; her broad chest is covered with a buff neckerchief, and below this you see a sort of short bedgown made of blue-checkered linen, tied round the waist and descending to the hips, from whence there is a considerable length of linsey-woolsey petticoat. For Lisbeth is tall, and in other points too there is a strong likeness between her and her son Adam. Her dark eyes are somewhat dim now--perhaps from too much crying--but her broadly marked eyebrows are still black, her teeth are sound, and as she stands knitting rapidly and unconsciously with her work-hardened hands, she has as firmly upright an attitude as when she is carrying a pail of water on her head from the spring. There is the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> and the same keen activity of temperament in mother and son, but it was not from her that Adam got his well-filled brow and his expression of large-hearted intelligence.|$|E

40|$|Framing {{theory has}} reached an {{increasing}} role in media communication research, including common principles between different research perspectives. Besides the multiple ways {{of understanding the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>frame,</b> a controversy about the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> exists. Despite considerable integrating research efforts (D’Angelo, 2002; De Vreese, 2005; Entman, 1993, 2004; López-Rabadán, 2010; Matthes, 2012; Reese, 2007; Scheufele, 1999), scholars have not reached yet full conceptual and methodological convergence, so that definitions, theoretical models, <b>frames</b> measuring mode, <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>frames,</b> processes or effects differ in each study (Scheufele, 1999). This article provides an updated review of the different paradigms that define research efforts on this theory, and mentions the advantages to invest in an integrative model or paradigmatic synthesis for future studies. Through {{a comprehensive review of}} the published literature, we propose two objectives. On the one hand, to provide a taxonomy <b>of</b> the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame</b> to clarify differences detected among studies labeled under this theory. It also seeks to justify the need to consider Framing theory as a multiparadigmatic research program (D'Angelo, 2002) that could include all perspectives established so far...|$|R

50|$|Frame {{synchronization}} {{is necessary}} to identify the timeslots within each 24-channel frame. Synchronization takes place by allocating a framing, or 193rd, bit. This results in 8 kbit/s <b>of</b> <b>framing</b> data, for each DS1. Because this 8-kbit/s channel {{is used by the}} transmitting equipment as overhead, only 1.536 Mbit/s is actually passed on to the user. Two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>framing</b> schemes are superframe (SF) and extended superframe (ESF). A superframe consists of twelve consecutive 193-bit frames, whereas an extended superframe consists of twenty-four consecutive 193-bit <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> data. Due to the unique bit sequences exchanged, the framing schemes are not compatible with each other. These two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>framing</b> (SF, and ESF) use their 8 kbit/s framing channel in different ways.|$|R

40|$|Framing {{theory is}} one of the most {{significant}} approaches to understanding media and their potential impact on publics. Leaving aside that fact, the author finds that publicity effects seem to be dispersed and difficult to catch for public relations. This article employs a specific research design, which could be applied to public relations practice, namely with a view to observing correlations between specific media frames and individual frames. The approach is based on the typology <b>of</b> news <b>frames.</b> The author attributes negative, positive and neutral determinants to the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> in his empirical research. Online news regarding three transport organizations and the accompanying user comments (identified as negative, positive and neutral) are analysed by means of the method of content and sentiment analysis. The author recognizes user comments and reviews as individual frames that take part in the creation of online image. Furthermore, he identifies the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> media <b>frames</b> as well as individual frames manifested as image, and undertakes correlation research in order to establish their prediction potential. The results expose the most frequently used <b>types</b> <b>of</b> media <b>frames</b> concerning the transport domain. The media are keen to report through the attribution <b>of</b> responsibility <b>frame,</b> and after that, through the economic frame and the conflict frame, but, on the other hand, they tend to neglect the human interest frame and the morality frame. The results show that specific <b>types</b> <b>of</b> news <b>frames</b> enable better prediction of user reactions. The economic frame and the human interest frame therefore represent the most predictable <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>frame...</b>|$|R
