I.torosus displays the following characteristic colour changes with <b>tests</b> <b>performed</b> on cut flesh less than 12 hours old: ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH)–yellow centre bordered by a blue circular outer ring; potassium hydroxide (KOH)– deep buff (instantly); ferrous sulphate (FeS04)–no change; Melzer's reagent–dark blue; phenol–blue green (very slow); formalin–mid blue (slow).|$|E

If METO (maximum except take-off) power was applied to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines, and full reverse thrust was applied to engine No. 4, then the aircraft would become uncontrollable.|$|E

5|$|The {{gray wolf}} has interbred {{extensively}} with the eastern wolf producing a hybrid population termed Great Lakes boreal wolves. Unlike {{the red and}} eastern wolf, the gray wolf does not readily interbreed with coyotes. Nevertheless, coyote genetic markers {{have been found in}} some wild isolated gray wolf populations in the southern United States. Gray wolf Y-chromosomes have also been found in Texan coyote haplotypes. In <b>tests</b> <b>performed</b> on a Texan canid of ambiguous species, mtDNA analysis showed that it was a coyote, though subsequent tests revealed that it was a coyote–gray wolf hybrid sired by a male Mexican gray wolf. In 2013, a captive breeding experiment in Utah between gray wolves and western coyotes produced six hybrids through artificial insemination, making this the very first hybridization case between pure coyotes and northwestern gray wolves. At six months of age, the hybrids were closely monitored and were shown to display both physical and behavioral characteristics from both species. Although hybridization between wolves and golden jackals has never been observed, evidence of such occurrences was discovered through mtDNA analysis on jackals in Bulgaria. Although there is no genetic evidence of gray wolf-jackal hybridization in the Caucasus Mountains, there have been cases where otherwise genetically pure golden jackals have displayed remarkably gray wolf-like phenotypes, {{to the point of being}} mistaken for wolves by trained biologists.|$|E

40|$|This paper compares several {{tests for}} {{specification}} error in regression models when {{the alternative is}} nonspecific. The author considers the Durbin-Watson, RESET, Chow, and differencing tests. Perhaps not surprisingly, each <b>test</b> tends to <b>perform</b> well only against their "designed" alternatives. That is, {{with only a few}} exceptions, the differencing <b>tests</b> <b>perform</b> well against omitted dynamics, the Durbin-Watson <b>test</b> <b>performs</b> well when the omitted is autocorrelated, RESET performs well against incorrect functional form, and the Chow <b>test</b> <b>performs</b> well against structural shifts. These results are disappointing in that the tests have been proposed as tests against "general" or "nonconstructive" alternatives.
