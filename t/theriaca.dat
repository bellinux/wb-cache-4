It isn't known if the poem was about Canobus (sometimes called Canopus), the helmsman of Menelaus, buried in Egypt, or about {{the foundation of the}} city bearing his name.

500|$|There are {{numerous}} variants in other authors. Most {{of these are}} incidental references in poems and scholiasts. The Roman poet Vergil shows Orion as a giant wading through the Aegean Sea with the waves breaking against his shoulders; rather than, as the mythographers have it, walking on the water. There are several references to Hyrieus {{as the father of}} Orion that connect him to various places in Boeotia, including Hyria; this may well be the original story (although not the first attested), since Hyrieus is presumably the [...] of Hyria. He is also called Oeneus, although he is not the Calydonian Oeneus. Other ancient scholia say, as Hesiod does, that Orion was the son of Poseidon and his mother was a daughter of Minos; but they call the daughter Brylle or Hyeles. There are two versions where Artemis killed Orion, either with her arrows or by producing the Scorpion. In the second variant, Orion died of the Scorpion's sting as he does in Hesiod. Although Orion does not defeat the Scorpion in any version, several variants have it die from its wounds. Artemis is given various motives. One is that Orion boasted of his beast-killing and challenged her to a contest with the discus. Another is that he assaulted either Artemis herself or Opis, a Hyperborean maiden in her band of huntresses. Aratus's brief description, in his Astronomy, conflates the elements of the myth: according to Aratus, Orion attacks Artemis while hunting on Chios, and the Scorpion kills him there. Nicander, in his <b>Theriaca,</b> has the scorpion of ordinary size and hiding under a small (oligos) stone. Most versions of the story that continue after Orion's death tell of the gods raising Orion and the Scorpion to the stars, but even here a variant exists: Ancient poets differed greatly as to who Aesculapius brought back from the dead; the Argive epic poet Telesarchus is quoted as saying in a scholion that Aesculapius resurrected Orion. Other ancient authorities are quoted anonymously that Aesculapius healed Orion after he was blinded by Oenopion.|$|E

5000|$|Historically, the Middle English term treacle {{was used}} by {{herbalists}} and apothecaries to describe a medicine (also called theriac or <b>theriaca),</b> composed of many ingredients, that {{was used as an}} antidote treatment for poisons, snakebites, and various other ailments. Triacle comes from the Old French triacle, in turn from (unattested and reconstructed) Vulgar Latin triacula, which comes from Latin <b>theriaca,</b> the latinisation of the Greek θηριακή (thēriakē), the feminine of θηριακός (thēriakos), [...] "concerning venomous beasts", which comes from θηρίον (thērion), [...] "wild animal, beast".|$|E
50|$|<b>Theriaca</b> andromachi or Venice Treacle {{contained}} 64 ingredients. In {{addition to}} viper flesh and opium, it included cinnamon, agarics and gum arabic. The ingredients were pulverized and reduced to an electuary with honey.|$|E
50|$|Others {{suppose that}} a {{physician}} of this {{name is not}} the author either of the poem or the antidote, but that they are connected in some way with the <b>Theriaca</b> which Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, was {{in the habit of}} using, and the prescription for which he dedicated in verse to Asclepius or Apollo.|$|E
5000|$|Theriac or <b>theriaca</b> was {{a medical}} {{concoction}} originally formulated by the Greeks in the 1st century AD and widely {{adopted in the}} ancient world as far away as China and India via the trading links of the Silk Route. It was an alexipharmic, or antidote, considered a panacea, for which it could serve as a synonym: in the 16th century Adam Lonicer wrote that garlic was the rustic's theriac or Heal-All.|$|E

50|$|Aemilius Macer of Verona was a Roman didactic poet. He {{authored}} two poems, one on birds (Ornithogonia), {{a translation}} of a work by Boios, {{and the other on}} the antidotes against the poison of serpents (<b>Theriaca),</b> which he imitated from the Greek poet Nicander of Colophon. According to Jerome, he died in 16 BC. It is possible that he wrote also a botanical work. The extant hexameter poem known as Floridus or De viribus (aut virtutibus) herbarum, traditionally ascribed to Macer, is actually a medieval production by Odo Magdunensis, a French physician.|$|E
50|$|He wrote {{a number}} of works both in prose and verse, of which two survive complete. The longest, <b>Theriaca,</b> is a hexameter poem (958 lines) {{on the nature of}} venomous animals and the wounds which they inflict. The other, Alexipharmaca, {{consists}} of 630 hexameters treating of poisons and their antidotes. Nicander's main source for medical information was the physician Apollodorus of Egypt. Among his lost works, Heteroeumena was a mythological epic, used by Ovid in the Metamorphoses and epitomized by Antoninus Liberalis; Georgica, of which considerable fragments survive, was perhaps imitated by Virgil.|$|E
50|$|Parkin is {{virtually}} unknown {{south of the}} Humber. It is eaten {{in an area where}} oats were the staple grain for the poor, rather than wheat. It is closely related to tharf cake - an unsweeted cake cooked on a griddle rather than baked. The traditional time of the year for tharf cakes to be made was directly after the oat harvest in the first week in November. For festive occasions, the cake would be sweetened with honey. In the seventeenth century (about 1650) sugar started to be imported from Barbados- and molasses was a by-product of the refining process. Molasses was first used by apothecaries; to make a medicine <b>theriaca,</b> from which name the word treacle is derived. As molasses became plentiful, or treacle as it became called at that time, it was substituted for honey in the preparation of tharf cakes.|$|E
5000|$|Among Maranta's most-referenced {{works is}} his {{treatise}} on antidotes to poisons, Della <b>theriaca</b> et del mithridato, {{in two volumes}} (1572). Maranta maintained that theriac had been tested on criminals condemned to death and was proven in antiquity to be infallible. It was also a treatment for all diseases. If theriac failed to produce results, he said, {{it was because the}} physicians and pharmacists of his own time lacked the knowledge to compound it. Maranta conducted experiments in the natural history museum of Ferrante Imperato on the proportion of wine needed to dissolve the ingredients for theriac, claiming that [...] "it preserves the healthy" [...] and [...] "cures the sick." [...] But theriac was a controversial drug; in the 1570s, two physicians were expelled from the College of Physicians in Brescia for overprescribing it, and Maranta had to fend off criticism for substituting an ingredient in the formula.|$|E
5000|$|Aelianus Meccius (Gr. [...] ) was {{an ancient}} physician, {{who must have}} lived in the 2nd century BC, as he is {{mentioned}} by Galen as the oldest of his tutors. [...] His father is supposed to have also been a physician, as Aelianus is said by Galen to have made an epitome of his father's anatomical writings. [...] Galen speaks of that part of his work which treated of the Dissection of the Muscles as being held in some repute in his time, and he always mentions his tutor with respect. [...] During the prevalence of an epidemic in Italy, Aelianus is said by Galen to have used the <b>Theriaca</b> with great success, both as a means of cure and also as a preservative against the disease. [...] He must have been a person of some celebrity, as this same anecdote is mentioned by the Arabic historian Abu al-Faraj, with exactly the same circumstances except that he makes the epidemic to have broken out at Antioch instead of in Italy. None of his works are now extant.|$|E
5000|$|Aelius Promotus (Gr. [...] ) was {{an ancient}} {{physician}} of Alexandria, of whose personal history no particulars are known, and whose date is uncertain.

By others he {{is considered to be}} much more ancient; yet other scholars place him as late as {{the second half of the}} 1st century AD. He is most probably the same person who is quoted by Galen simply by the name of Aelius. [...] He wrote several Greek medical works, which are still to be found in manuscript in different libraries in Europe.

40|$|Greeks from quite early {{started to}} {{describe}} the natural en-vironment. At the time biological sciences were consid-ered part of philosophical studies hence it was perfectly natural for a philosopher such as Democritus to contem-plate “on the Nature of Man ” or to write books like the “Causes concerned with Animals ” (for a presentation of Democritus ’ work on nature see Guthrie 1996). The very name of the discipline of herpetology derives from the Greek words ερπετó (reptile) and λóγος (science) while the term amphibian reflects the typical dual (aquatic and ter-restrial) life style of frogs (from the Greek αµϕí – both– and β íoς – life). The first formal Greek herpetologist was Aristotle himself. In his books on animals (History of Animals, Generation of Animals and On the Parts of Animals) the father of zoology discussed the morphology, physiology and classification of reptiles and amphibians. Nicander {{was fascinated by the}} lethal power of snakes, focusing on the venom of serpents in two of his surviving poems (<b>Theriaca,</b> Alexipharmaca, see Knoefel & Covi 1991). In late antiquity Pausanias, though he wasn’t a naturalist, gave interesting information on the fauna and flora in various locations in Greece through the ten books of his notorious Description of Greece (Eλλáδος Περι ńγσις). Therein one could find citations to the Greek herpetofauna such as the Seriphian frogs or the tortoises of Arcadia...|$|E
40|$|Pain {{has always}} been part of human experience. Over the ages there has been a demand for methods of relief. The aim of this {{research}} is to study the evolution of the therapy of acute and chronic pain throughout the centuries until today. Opium, which is obtained from the plant Papaver somniferum, is probably the oldest representative of natural analgesic, given that poppies and seeds of the plant have been found in Mesopotamia dating back to approximately 4000 B. C. The first known written reference of its use appears in a Sumerian text dated around 3400 B. C. The use of opium for analgesic purposes spread to Ancient Egypt. Among the plants which were used as analgesics by the people of Mesopotamia and the Egyptians were mandrake, hyoscyamus, atropa belladonna and other sedative herbs. In order to offer relief for pain during surgery, they used to apply anaesthetic methods which today seem, at best, amusing, and, at worst, cruel and barbaric, such as suffocation after strangulation. In addition, because of the religious and magical explanation which were given to sickness and pain, they believed that they would relieve the pain through prayers and incantations. At the same time as acupuncture was developed in Ancient China, the chewing of coca leaves was practiced throughout South America. Opium was well known to the ancient Greeks in Minoan Crete, from as far back as 1450 B. C. It is believed that the drug nepenthes which Homer mentions in the Odyssey in the 8 th century B. C. is opium. Hippocrates was the first who claimed that diseases have natural and not magical causes and attributed the pain to dyskrasia of the four “humors”. There is reference to 236 plants in his work “Corpus Hippocraticum”, most of them with analgesic properties, such as atropa belladonna, hyoskyamus, mandrake, papaver somniferum, bark and leaves of the willow tree. He also recommends baths, exercise and healthy nutrition. However, the use of analgetics during surgery wasn’t established in ancient Greece. Medicine in Rome introduced <b>theriaca,</b> a famous drug, which contained over 100 ingredients with opium being one of the most important. Theophrastus, Pliny the Elder, Dioskourides Pedanios and others describe in detail the medical applications of papaver somniferum. Dioskourides used wine from mandrake to prevent pain during surgery. He also applied sleeping sponge, a sea sponge that was saturated with the mixed juices of soporific plants, to the patient’s nostrils to achieve anesthesia through inhalation. Galen recommended opium in case of serious pain, but he considered it also as a potent poison. The knowledge of Greek and Roman medicine was kept alive and used as a basis during Byzantine times, when <b>theriaca,</b> opium and mandrake were popular painkillers. In the 6 th century AD Alexander of Tralles introduces the use of the plant Colchicum automnale for the treatment of pain from gout. In the Middle East, Arabic translation of the Greek medicine helped to make Islamic physicians supreme in the middle Ages and the Arab pharmacopoeia of the time was extensive thanks to Alchemists. ...|$|E
