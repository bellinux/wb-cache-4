25|$|Meanwhile, {{a mysterious}} new witch comes into play, being {{revealed}} to be Crowley's mother, Rowena. Also, the angel Hannah goes back to Heaven so that her vessel can have her life back. A large focus of the season is Dean's quest to overcome the Mark of Cain and have it removed if possible. After the Mark causes him to break Charlie's arm, Sam suggests that Dean {{has the ability to}} at least partially control the Mark, but only if he can control himself. New hope for ridding Dean of the Mark comes when Charlie unearths the Book of the Damned. Sam needs help in reading and using this powerful tome, and turns to Rowena for help, keeping <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>thing</b> a secret from Dean. He requests help from Charlie, too, who decodes the text but is murdered by the Steins, a family that has secretly controlled much of history. After massacring the Steins, nearly killing Castiel and getting another hunter killed, Dean starts despairing of being free of the Mark, causing him to turn to Death for help. Death proposes putting Dean in isolation away the Earth, but insists Dean must kill Sam, who otherwise would work to bring Dean back. Sam and Dean both agree that it is {{for the good of the}} world. At the last moment however, Dean seemingly kills Death instead to save Sam. Oblivious to the dangers, Rowena successfully casts the spell to remove the Mark and unleashes the Darkness, a primordial evil that had been kept away by the Mark. Rowena also places Castiel under a spell so he attacks Crowley as she escapes with the Book of the Damned.|$|E

Before leaving, Elphaba regrets that she'll never see Glinda again and tell her that she and Fiyero are alive. Simultaneously, returning to the musical's starting point, Glinda reports to the people of Oz that the Wicked Witch of the West has been killed and promises to properly earn her title as Glinda the Good.

500|$|Most of {{the album}} was {{recorded}} at Brian's home studio in Bel Air from June 3 to July 14, 1967. Since the recording of [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in 1966, Wilson had established a new method of operation. Instead of working on whole songs with clear large-scale syntactical structures, Wilson limited himself to recording short interchangeable fragments (or [...] "modules"). Through the method of tape splicing, each fragment could then be assembled into a linear sequence, allowing any number of larger structures and divergent moods to be produced at a later time. Smiley Smile continued this approach. It was the first album for which production was credited to the entire group, instead of Brian alone. Dennis explained: [...] "He wanted it that way. He said 'It's produced by the Beach Boys.'" [...] When asked if Brian was [...] "still the producer of Smiley Smile," [...] Carl answered, [...] "Most definitely." [...] Brian acknowledged: [...] "We had done about six months work on another thing, but we jumped and ended up doing <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>thing</b> here at the house with an entirely different mood and approach than what we originally started out with."

[...] Similarly, Leah Collins of Dose magazine wrote, [...] "New jack swing dance moves and costume changes are pretty much {{the focus of this}} one. [...] Still, Beyonce reveals a talent we never knew she had: the ability to switch costumes every time she switches keys. (This, it turns out, is a good thing.

[...] Georgette Cline of The Boombox found similarities between the video for [...] "Love On Top" [...] and the earlier videos that Beyoncé made with Destiny's Child while Sarah Anne Hughes of The Washington Post called the video fancy and an [...] "obvious homage to New Edition's 'If It Isn’t Love.'" [...] A more mixed review was given by Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine who wrote that [...] "The video will do nothing to silence Beyoncé plagiarism or baby bump conspiracy theorists; the first half borrows from an old New Edition video, and <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>thing</b> was clearly filmed before her bump began to show." [...] However, she added, [...] "Still, Vulture salutes any artistic undertaking that requires a costume change with every key change." [...] The video was nominated in the category for Video of the Year at the 2012 BET Awards and in the category for Best Female Video at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards.

He concluded in his review, [...] "The relentless pace, ever-changing visuals and sheer amount of songs crammed into the set is a lot to take in, let alone the fact that Beyoncé delivers <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>thing</b> with power yet impeccable ease. When it comes to putting on a show of this calibre, these days she's really only competing with herself." [...] The Observers Kitty Empire praised the singer's ranuchiness during the tour different from the other performers and concluded by writing, [...] "There is no question as to Beyoncé's own powers. She can stop and start her all-female band... with a click of her fingers, and keep climbing octaves until you think her lungs are about to jump out of her chest. She sings (with a range that only gets wider and deeper with every tour) and dances (flawlessly) for more than one and a half hours." [...] David Pollock of The Independent felt that, [...] "this near two-hour epic is a ferocious distillation of musical styles old and new and a stunning declaration of intent that Knowles intends to be recognised as the defining pop artist of her era.

30|$|Besides, the {{industry}} life cycle {{plays a role}} in <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> scheme of <b>things.</b> For instance, in the specific case of industry associations, at some point they transform from archetypal commons setup to some sort of club wherein exclusion criteria are applicable. How rapidly and when, if ever, this transformation will occur depends on industry trajectory and lifecycle. Closely related to the foregoing is the relevance of the macroeconomic environment. It can be argued that the innovation commons may be more intense where there are missing links in the macroeconomic environment. For instance, in the face of state failure, private actors might reciprocally see a common solution as the most efficient way of solving their innovation problems. Where there are no such macro challenges, perhaps it is more difficult to frame the innovation problem as a commons issue. This is indeed the basis for many industry associations in developing countries.|$|R

This study shows that hypothesis to be correct: Utah science teachers do not feel prepared to teach engineering design. The feelings of teacher preparedness can be improved through professional development and inclusion of engineering design into science teacher education programs.

Genuine and remarkable cures have been achieved through contact with the relics of a saint. Is it not likely that any other bones would have done as well if the substitution had been concealed from the patient? When I was a boy a farmer's wife who lived five miles from our village had great fame as a faith-doctor--that was what she called herself. Sufferers came to her from all around, and she laid her hand upon them and said, [...] "Have faith--it is all that is necessary," [...] and they went away well of their ailments. She was not a religious woman, and pretended to no occult powers. She said that the patient's faith in her did the work. Several times I saw her make immediate cures of severe toothaches. My mother was the patient. In Austria there is a peasant who drives a great trade in this sort of industry, and has both the high and the low for patients. He gets into prison every now and then for practising without a diploma, but his business is as brisk as ever when he gets out, for his work is unquestionably successful and keeps his reputation high.

For more than 30 years, understanding how this is possible has been the central empirical and theoretical con-cern of most of the developmental psychologists and linguists who study the process of word learning experimentally. This attention has not been misplaced. The domain of word learning has provided a fertile ground for testing competing accounts of children’s understanding of ref-erence in language, their use of ontological divisions and other world knowledge in categoriza-tion, and their grasp of syntactic regularities. On the whole, children have performed surprisingly well in these experiments—by the age of two or three, they make efficient and appropriate use {{of a wide range of}} sources of information in determining what speakers are referring to in the moment, and in evaluating how novel words may be used in future situations. Most such tests have taken place in contrived but well-controlled experimental situations in which a brief exposure to a novel word, in a particular social or linguistic context, is revealed t...|$|R
