5|$|The {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek {{is continuing}} to become more developed, but at a slower rate than {{it has in the}} past.

40|$|Heihe River Basin is {{the second}} largest inland river basin in China, where water supply service in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> has greater {{influence}} on the sustainable development of middle and lower reaches. This study analyzed the influence of land use/land cover change (LUCC) on the water supply service in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> by carrying out scenario simulation. Firstly, we analyzed the LUCC and climate change in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> during 1990 - 2005; then the water supply service, which was represented by the annual water yield, was estimated with the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model. Thereafter three scenarios (precipitation change and LUCC change combined, LUCC change only, and precipitation change only) were established to analyze the impacts of LUCC and precipitation change on the water yield. The {{results show that the}} LUCC exerted great influence on water yield, while the impact of precipitation change is even more significant than that of LUCC. Although there are still some uncertainties, {{the results of this study}} can still provide valuable reference information for ecological conservation and water resource management in <b>the</b> <b>upper</b> <b>reach</b> of <b>the</b> Heihe River Basin...|$|R

5|$|The sand whiting {{commonly}} inhabits shallow sandy substrates in bays, estuaries and surf zones {{where it}} preys on polychaete worms, small crustaceans and bivalve molluscs.
