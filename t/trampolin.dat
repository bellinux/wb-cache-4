He made the first modern trampoline in his garage to reproduce this {{on a smaller scale}} and used it to help with his diving and tumbling activities. He formed a company to build trampolines for sale and used a variant of the Spanish word <b>trampolin</b> (diving board) as a trademark. He used the trampoline to entertain audiences and also let them participate in his demonstrations as part of his marketing strategy. [...] This was the beginnings of a new sport.|$|E

50|$|According to circus folklore, the {{trampoline}} {{was supposedly}} first developed by an artiste named du <b>Trampolin,</b> {{who saw the}} possibility of using the trapeze safety net as a form of propulsion and landing device and experimented with different systems of suspension, eventually reducing the net to a practical size for separate performance. While trampoline-like devices were used for shows and in the circus, the story of du <b>Trampolin</b> is almost certainly apocryphal. No documentary evidence has been found to support it.|$|E

50|$|The {{early years}} also saw Panamericana define {{itself as the}} market leader; news {{programs}} such as El Panamericano, hosted by Humberto Martínez Morosini and Ernesto García Calderón among others, became highly rated, while telenovelas such as Simplemente María and Natacha found success in the Latin American market. In 1966, the variety show <b>Trampolín</b> a la Fama, hosted by converted radio personality Augusto Ferrando would be launched, staying on the air for thirty years and {{becoming one of the}} most popular programs in the country.|$|E
50|$|After he had {{graduated}} in Business Studies in 1937, Nissen and two friends toured the United States of America and Mexico performing at fairs and carnivals. While in Mexico, {{he heard the}} word <b>trampolín,</b> springboard in Spanish, and decided {{to use it for}} his bouncing apparatus. He trademarked the word in an anglicised form. He built a few trampolines and promoted the sale of his trampolines by touring performances, which did gradually increase sales. In 1941, he and Griswold set up the Griswold-Nissen Trampoline & Tumbling Company in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.|$|E
5000|$|Keel (Introduced: 2006)The Keel {{upgrade to}} the LP12 is a {{replacement}} subchassis, machined from solid aluminium. It {{builds on the}} Cirkus upgrade (now fitted as standard to new LP12s) but is not included as standard in 'regular' production LP12s. Linn claims that the Keel is an application of its [...] "close-tolerance aluminium machining", first seen in the ingot casing of the Sondek CD12 CD player. The Keel, along with the Ekos SE tonearm and <b>Trampolin</b> Mk.2 were three Special Edition upgrades for the turntable's 33⅓ birthday, 33⅓ being the standard rotational speed when playing LPs.|$|E

50|$|Puerto Rican {{actor and}} singer Juan Carlos Morales, who himself was once {{accepted}} by Menudo {{but who had}} {{to pull out of}} the group because his mother did not allow him to join it, announced in 2016, that he and Spaniard producing company El <b>Trampolin</b> are developing a television series largely based on both La Pandilla and Menudo's hits, about a male homosexual couple who adopt four boys and one girl and form a tribute band named #La Pandilla. The series, a sitcom named #La Pandilla, is tentatively set to debut on Spanish television during 2017.|$|E

[...] He worked at Editorial Valenciana until its demise in 1984, but this does not prevent him from publishing works in the press or humorous magazines from other publishers. Some remarkable characters are Benjamín y su pandilla (1955) for the weekly children's <b>Trampolín</b> or Robín Robot, who developed his adventures in the magazine Zipi y Zape of Editorial Bruguera in 1972.|$|E
5000|$|El Puente de Dios is {{two miles}} (3 km) {{northwest}} of Tamasopo town. It consists of waterfalls {{into a narrow}} gorge and cavern beneath an arch through which the Gallinas river runs rapidly. Blue and clear water pools for swimming {{are at the top}} and bottom of the cavern. The Cascada de Tamasopo is two miles (3 km) north of the town. It features three cascades tumbling about 20 m into pools divided by travertine ledges and shelves. The character of the waterfalls reminds some travelers of Havasu Falls in the Grand Canyon. [...] Nearby is El <b>Trampolin</b> which consists of small waterfalls falling into clear, deep pools in the midst of a tropical forest.|$|E

50|$|The {{first modern}} {{trampoline}} {{was built by}} George Nissen and Larry Griswold in 1936. Nissen was a gymnastics and diving competitor and Griswold was a tumbler on the gymnastics team, both at the University of Iowa, United States. They had observed trapeze artists using a tight net to add entertainment value to their performance and experimented by stretching a piece of canvas, {{in which they had}} inserted grommets along each side, to an angle iron frame by means of coiled springs. It was initially used to train tumblers but soon became popular in its own right. Nissen explained that the name came from the Spanish <b>trampolín,</b> meaning a diving board. Nissen had heard the word on a demonstration tour in Mexico in the late 1930s and decided to use an anglicized form as the trademark for the apparatus.|$|E

In these two cases, we will analysis which factor there have impact on the co-production and the anchoring.

40|$|Resumen Se realizó un estudio para analizar la capacidad de salto en gimnastas de <b>trampolín</b> españoles y comparar distintas categorías entre sí, mediante un diseño descriptivo y transversal. La muestra estuvo compuesta por 60 gimnastas de <b>trampolín</b> pertenecientes a la élite nacional, agrupados según su grupo de edad y categoría competitiva, diferenciando en total 4 grupos: grupo de edad Sub- 15 masculino (GM 1, n = 23; 11, 95 ± 1, 79 años) y femenino (GF 1, n = 9; 11, 44 ± 1, 23 años); grupo de edad Absoluto masculino (GM 2, n = 18; 20, 72 ± 4, 66 años) y femenino (GF 2, n = 10; 16, 1 ± 2, 02 años). Para evaluar la capacidad de salto se midió la altura en el SJ y CMJ, mediante plataforma de contacto; además se estimó la potencia mecánica según la fórmula de Sayers et al. (1991). Las diferencias significativas (p Abstract A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to analyze the jump capacity jump in Spanish trampoline gymnasts and compare different categories with each other, through a descriptive cross-sectional design. The sample consisted of 60 trampoline gymnasts belonging to the national elite, grouped by age and sex in different competitive categories, differentiating finally 4 groups: age group male Under- 15 (GM 1 n = 23; 11, 95 ± 1, 79 years) and female (GF 1 n = 9; 11, 44 ± 1, 23 years); age group male Absolute (GM 2 n = 18; 20, 72 ± 4, 66 years) and female (GF 2 n = 10; 16, 1 ± 2, 02 years). To assess the jump capacity was measured height in the SJ and CMJ, through contact platform; additionally mechanical power was estimated according to the formula of Sayers et al. (1991). Significant differences were found (p< 0, 05) : GM 1 -GM 2, higher results in GM 2 in CMJ height, power of SJ and CMJ; GF 1 -GF 2, higher values in GF 2 in power of SJ and CMJ; GM 1 -GF 1, higher values in GM 1 in height and relative power of SJ; GM 2 -GF 2, higher results in GM 2 in all variables. These results are consistent with the characteristics of sex and maturational development, supporting separation for competition in male and female categories and age groups Under- 15 and Absolute; suggest further a different jump capacity in trampoline gymnasts compared with gymnasts of another specialties. </p...|$|E
