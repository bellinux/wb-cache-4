[...] Though in the past he preferred <b>to</b> <b>ruminate</b> on his lyrics for days on end, Feldmann's speedy process gave Hoppus little time to process them. Despite this, he felt he wrote [...] "some of the best lyrics I've written in a long time for this record, because I didn't have a chance to go and overthink things."

40|$|In {{consideration}} of existing contradictory findings, {{the aim of}} the present study was to overcome the limitations of traditional cardiac reactivity studies. First, we examined the cardiac activation that takes place in response <b>to</b> <b>ruminating</b> about stress, independently of the presence of a real stressor, and second, we focused on the underlying physiological components of cardiac regulation during rumination, that is, the sympathetic and parasympathetic components. In 60 participants (27 men and 33 women; mean age = 33. 4 +/- 9. 5 years), we recorded cardiac impedance and heart rate during baseline, an Anger Recall Interview, a reading task, and two recovery periods. Rumination was experimentally manipulated by the use of a distracter. Nondistracted participants showed higher sympathetic activity as suggested by shorter pre-ejection period, higher low-frequency heart rate variability (LF-HRV), higher ratio of LF to high frequency HRV (HF-HRV), and diminished parasympathetic activity (lower HF-HRV). The results underscore the association of rumination with a series of well-known risk factors for health...|$|R

2500|$|On the {{individual}} level, minority stress research has uncovered {{differences in how}} minorities react to prejudice. [...] For example, {{studies have shown that}} some individuals ruminate on experiences with prejudice, which is associated with anxiety and depression. This information can be used to develop effective therapies for use with minority individuals, which teach them not <b>to</b> <b>ruminate</b> on experiences with prejudice in order to improve well-being. Similarly, minority stress research has revealed that internalized stigma (i.e., distaste for one's own minority group) is associated with negative psychological outcomes. [...] From these findings, clinicians have developed some interventions to decrease internalized stigma and improve well-being for minority individuals. [...] When paired with structural interventions, these clinical applications for reducing minority stress may help to improve the pervasive health disparities observed in minority communities.|$|E
2500|$|The {{proximal}} stress processes reviewed {{above are}} unique to specific minority groups; for example, internalized homophobia is a proximal stressor unique to LGBT individuals who experience prejudice about their sexual and or/gender orientation/expression, and vigilance against racism is unique to racial minorities who fear future experiences with race-based discrimination. [...] It {{is also possible that}} more general psychological processes act as proximal stressors for minority individuals. For example, exposure to prejudice may lead to rumination, which is a common psychological phenomenon characterized by a maladaptive, repetitive, and obsessive focus on a past event that leads to depressive and anxious symptoms. Several recent studies have shown that distal stressors are associated with such general proximal stress processes among minority individuals. [...] In one longitudinal study, researchers found that gay men who experienced distal stressors related to their sexual orientation had an increased tendency <b>to</b> <b>ruminate,</b> which was associated with increased depressive and anxious symptoms compared to gay men who did not experience distal stressors. In another study, LGBT youth reported higher rates of rumination on days when they experienced distal stressors; rumination in turn was associated with psychological distress. Because minority individuals have been shown to face high rates of distal stressors compared to majority individuals, and because experiencing distal stressors is associated with general psychological stress processes such as rumination and anxiety, these findings highlight the more general ways in which prejudice and discrimination may affect internal stress processes among minority individuals.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether the partial replacement of roughage from forage with non-forage fiber sources, in a total mixed ration (TMR), could reduce feed sorting by dairy cows without modifying behaviour and milk production. Twelve Holstein cows were fed two TMR maize silage based diets in a cross-over experiment. Compared to the control diet (C-diet), experimental diet (E-diet) was formulated by replacing 8 % neutral detergent fibre (NDF) from straw and alfalfa hay with soybean hulls and wheat bran. E-diet had a lower physical effectiveness factor (pef) (0. 37 vs 0. 34; P vs 14. 6 %; P vs. 178 min/d; P< 0. 05) but showed the same number of meals per day. C-diet fed cows sorted against peNDF in a greater extent (98. 3 100. 9 %; P< 0. 05). Treatments did not affect cows time budget of general behaviors, with particular regard <b>to</b> <b>ruminating</b> activity.

40|$|Behaviour {{studies were}} carried out for 24 -hour periods on four groups of {{experimental}} goats. There were no major differences between the behaviour of the several animals within a group at any given trial, but there were small statistically significant differences in the times individual goats spent ruminating. The variability in behaviour of the same animal from one trial to the next was pronounced, but was accounted for mainly by differences within the sub-divisions of the major activities rather than in the major activities themselves. Trial to trial variation was greatest for the behaviour of the goats during the hours of darkness. The results indicate that certain differences in behaviour exist between the sexes. The male spent longer ruminating than the females, resulting in a narrower browsing <b>to</b> <b>ruminating</b> ratio for female goats of 1 : 2. 8 - compared to 1 : 3. 7. The major differences in the behaviour pattern of high and low plane lactating dams were due to the different systems of management employed. The longer period at browse of the high plane group resulted in a narrower browsing <b>to</b> <b>ruminating</b> ratio of 1 : 2. 7 compared to 1 : 6. 3 for the low plane group. Ruminating times remained relatively constant for all groups. The differences in behaviour between high and low plane kids of similar ages were very small. As with their dams low plane kids had wider browsing ruminating ratios, 1 : 2. 1 compared to 1 : 1. 7. The total feeding times of high and low plane kids were very similar, but low plane kids suckled their dams more frequently during the night than high kids. Observations on the plants eaten by goats showed that over half the browsing time was occupied eating leaves and shoots of trees and bushes, mostly throny Acacias. Grasses were eaten but generally only the inflorescence was eaten and {{there was no evidence of}} goats preventing grass establishment and spread. The preference of the goats was for succulent shoots at about head-height. Only very few species were consistently rejected. Observations on the reproductive behaviour of the goats showed that the mean gestation period was 146. 5 days. Pregnant goats were occasionally willing to accept service, 14 such instances being proven. The mean number of services per kid born was 2. 3...|$|R

40|$|Effects of wilting {{of grass}} prior to {{ensiling}} on OM intake, ruminal digestibility, efficiency of bacterial protein synthesis, and amount {{and composition of}} duodenal N fraction were examined using four lactating Holstein cows. Direct-cut or wilted grass silages were fed for ad libitum intake and supplemented with 5. 0 or 5. 3 kg of concentrate, respectively. Milk yield was 18. 1 and 21. 2 kg/d with direct-cut versus wilted silage, and milk protein and fat contents were 2. 63 and 4. 60 % with direct-cut versus 2. 75 and 4. 27 % with wilted silage, respectively. Wilting of the grass (from 17 to 38 % DM) increased OM intake but {{had no effect on}} ruminal digestibility. Total N flow and amounts of different AA in proximal duodenum were increased, and the difference was principally of bacterial origin. The efficiency of bacterial protein synthesis in rumen was related to dilution rate of liquid phase and to the time devoted <b>to</b> <b>ruminating.</b> These results indicate that the passage of bacterial protein to the lower digestive tract is a key factor for improving the assimilation of the soluble N fraction of grass silage and that this phenomenon is related to chewing activity...|$|R

40|$|Four {{primiparous}} Holstein-Friesian cows (518 kg average BW) with ruminal and duodenal cannulas {{were used}} to examine voluntary intake of direct cut (DC) or wilted (W) grass silage in relation to ruminal characteristics and chewing behavior. Dry matter content of the silages was 17. 0 and 38. 1 %, concentrate DM intake was restricted to 5. 0 and 5. 3 kg/d, and voluntary DM intake from silages averaged 7. 4 and 9. 5 kg/d (P =. 008), respectively. The acetate/propionate ratio in ruminal fluid decreased from 4. 0 on DC to 3. 3 on W silage (P =. 021). The protein content in milk increased from 26. 3 to 27. 5 g/liter (P =. 042) and the protein yield from 469 to 574 g/d (P =. 038). The distribution of concentrates (38 % of DM intake) with a mean particle size of. 04 cm reduced differences in fecal mean particle size between diets. There was a shift from eating <b>to</b> <b>ruminating</b> on W silage with regard to daily duration (min/d) and number of jaw movements (no. /d). However, ruminating index (no. /kg DM intake) remained unchanged, irrespective of wilting and chop length of the silages or physiological state of the animals.

Mean ruminal osmolality was 291 mosm/liter for the DC and 318 mosm/liter for the W silage (P less than. 05), with extreme values exceeding 350 mosm/liter for the W silage at 1 h to 2 h postfeeding. There was a shift from eating <b>to</b> <b>ruminating</b> on W silage associated with a longer duration of the average rumination bolus cycle (P less than. 01). Duration of chewing time per kilogram of DM intake was 103. 5 min and 91. 7 min (P less than. 05) for the DC and W silages, respectively. Fecal mean particle length was 2. 2 times greater (P less than. 01), accompanied by higher spread coefficients (P less than. 001), for the W silage.
