5|$|The Roman {{fortress}} of Deva was constructed from local sandstone, which was quarried {{across the river}} {{to the south of}} the fortress. Traces of <b>the</b> <b>quarry</b> are visible in Handbridge. In the 2nd century, a shrine to the Roman goddess Minerva was carved in <b>the</b> <b>quarry</b> for protection, perhaps by <b>the</b> <b>quarry</b> workers. Despite heavy weathering, the figure can be seen holding a spear and a shield with an owl above the left shoulder to symbolise wisdom. There is also a carving of an altar where offerings were left. The only rock-cut Roman shrine still in situ in Britain, the Minerva shrine is a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|The site {{reverted to}} private {{ownership}} after the war. As <b>the</b> <b>quarry</b> {{had long since}} been worked out, it was abandoned. The tunnels were not destroyed but were sealed off, though at some point they were reopened by local people and could be entered; the octagon remained sealed off with a ceiling-to-floor barricade. <b>The</b> <b>quarry</b> itself remained in almost the same condition {{as it had been}} in 1944, with sections of railway track still in place on <b>the</b> <b>quarry</b> floor. The hospital section remained relatively intact and was used by the local gendarmes as a shooting range.|$|E
5|$|Crucial to {{road and}} {{airfield}} development was {{the output of}} the Nine Mile Quarry. Initially it was run by the 1st Army Troops Company, which installed suspended electric lighting, allowing <b>the</b> <b>quarry</b> to be worked around the clock from 30 April 1942. Companies A and C of the 96th Engineer Battalion took over the running of <b>the</b> <b>quarry</b> in June. In turn, they were relieved by C Company of the 2/1st Pioneer Battalion in November. Work went on in three eight hour shifts per day, seven days a week. The face of <b>the</b> <b>quarry</b> was drilled from the top and dropped to the floor by blasting. Knapping hammers were used to break the stone into small pieces that could be lifted onto trucks by hand. There were two rock crushers on hand; an old model and a modern mobile diesel crusher supplied by the US Army.|$|E
5000|$|Quarrying on {{this site}} began in 1690 by James Stanclift, who {{contracted}} {{with the town}} of Middletown to build stonework {{in exchange for a}} deed of land. Commercial quarrying started in 1783 when <b>the</b> Brainerd <b>Quarry</b> Company began operations. During the peak of the brownstone era, more than 1500 workers were employed by <b>the</b> <b>quarries,</b> which shipped stone on their own ships for eight months out of the year. [...] Proceeds from <b>the</b> <b>quarrying</b> business were deeded to Wesleyan University from 1833 through 1884, and stone from <b>the</b> <b>quarries</b> was used to build many campus buildings. [...] As tastes in buildings shifted, and concrete became the material of choice, the demand for brownstone declined. A flood in 1936 and a hurricane in 1938 flooded <b>the</b> <b>quarries,</b> ending their operations. All efforts to drain <b>the</b> flooded <b>quarries</b> have been unsuccessful; one theory is that the floods opened some underground springs, making it impossible to effectively drain <b>the</b> <b>quarries.</b>|$|R
50|$|Between the two World Wars the British Ministry of Works petitioned {{for an end}} to <b>the</b> <b>quarrying</b> but was {{overruled}} by the Ministry of Transport. <b>The</b> <b>quarrying</b> {{then continued}} unchallenged.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Government <b>Quarry</b> (on <b>the</b> south {{eastern part}} of the locality) was {{variously}} named during its time of operation as Mr O'Connor's <b>quarry,</b> <b>the</b> Fremantle Harbour Works Darlington <b>Quarry,</b> <b>the</b> Public Works <b>Quarry,</b> <b>the</b> Government <b>Quarry,</b> and, currently, as Hudman Road Quarry.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>quarry</b> {{is also a}} prime {{location}} for geological research and provides opportunities for field studies {{in a variety of}} disciplines: sedimentology, stratigraphy, palaeontology, geography, and industrial archaeology. Several features make this a unique {{location for}} the study of rock formations. Visitors can examine the extensively exposed rock faces, primarily Kentish Ragstone and Hassock facies, and study changes in vertical and lateral facies. The facies are glauconitic with some horizons of silicification. Shell debris (ammonites, belemnites, nautiloids, bivalves, etc.) and bioturbation are also present. <b>The</b> <b>quarry</b> could be important for future research via gamma ray profiling of the rock beds in relation to changes in sea level and climate.|$|E
5|$|While Scully {{consoles}} Patti, {{whose husband}} just died in Scully's arms, Doggett {{reports that he}} cannot find the Shadow Man's body. Scully, fearful {{that he is a}} Super Soldier pursuing Mulder, chases after the train with Doggett and Reyes. An employee who works for the train gets a call on his radio, saying that someone jumped off a train and into a rock quarry. Doggett and Reyes chase after someone they believe to be Mulder, while Scully goes deeper into <b>the</b> <b>quarry.</b> There, she is attacked by the Shadow Man. Suddenly, the Shadow Man is destroyed by the magnetite being mined from <b>the</b> <b>quarry.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 2017, sauropod fossils {{had been}} {{recovered}} from a total of 32 localities within the Nemegt Formation, and possibly belong to either Opisthocoelicaudia or Nemegtosaurus. At least two finds from the Nemegt locality — a fragmentary tail (MPD 100/406) {{and a pair of}} claws – show features diagnostic for Opisthocoelicaudia and can be referred to the latter. Field crews led by Philip Currie attempted to relocate the Opisthocoelicaudia holotype quarry in 2006 and 2008, but became successful only in 2009 thanks to additional data provided by Gradziński. Although a prospection for additional bone material was not possible as <b>the</b> <b>quarry</b> had been filled by windblown sand, <b>the</b> <b>quarry</b> could be determined to fall within the lower portion of the Nemegt Formation.|$|E
50|$|In the 1700s {{there were}} <b>quarries</b> within <b>the</b> village. <b>The</b> <b>quarries</b> {{produced}} high quality freestone {{right up until}} the 1900s. In 1809-1812 stone from <b>the</b> <b>quarries</b> built <b>the</b> nearby Black and White Cart bridges.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>quarries</b> are {{now also}} {{used as an}} {{adventure}} rock climbing and scuba diving venue. The Blue Peris Mountain Centre, operated by Bedford Borough Council and Central Bedfordshire Council, conducts various outdoor activities at <b>the</b> <b>quarries.</b>|$|R
5|$|Fields {{adjacent}} to the temple belong {{to the city of}} San Francisco which has authorized the digging of a gravel quarry on the site. Local residents concerned about the temple's future brought a lawsuit to attempt block <b>the</b> <b>quarry</b> project, but eventually ran out of funds and dropped the suit.|$|E
5|$|Quarrying ceased in {{the early}} 1960s (1962–1965), when the stones {{extracted}} were no longer of sufficient quality. Between 1971 and 1978, <b>the</b> <b>quarry</b> was gradually filled with marl from the Bellignies quarry. Since then, the site has been completely recolonized by vegetation through ecological succession, forming tree, shrub and herb layers.|$|E
5|$|St Chad's Church {{collapsed}} in 1788 after attempts {{to expand the}} crypt compromised the structural integrity of the tower above; it was, however, rebuilt just four years later as a large neo-classical round church in a new location close to <b>the</b> <b>Quarry</b> Park.|$|E
50|$|Poudretteite was {{discovered}} in 1965 at <b>the</b> Poudrette <b>Quarry</b> in Canada and named after <b>the</b> <b>quarry's</b> owners and operators, the Poudrette family.|$|R
50|$|For example, no New Kingdom {{inscriptions}} {{were found}} {{and it was}} thought that <b>the</b> <b>quarries</b> were not used during that period. Shaw and his team found New Kingdom pottery fragments showing that workers from this period must have used <b>the</b> <b>quarries.</b>|$|R
50|$|At one time, the harbour {{exported}} slate from quarries a {{few miles}} south at Abereiddi, Trwynllwyd and Porthgain itself. Abereiddi and <b>the</b> <b>quarries</b> to <b>the</b> South were linked by a tramway. Water-powered mills at Porthgain sawed <b>the</b> <b>quarried</b> slate slabs before shipment.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Quarry</b> Pool {{is now a}} {{significant}} part of the nature reserve features of the head. While it was very acidic in the early years, since 1990 it has allowed the growth of {{a significant}} number of plant and insect species, as well as mallard and little grebe. The insects provide valuable food for migrating sand martins and swallows.|$|E
5|$|The {{lease on}} Bryn Eglwys expired in 1942, but was {{extended}} {{on an annual}} basis. The October 1942 Bradshaw's Guide shows two return passenger trains operating only on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays, taking 45 minutes in each direction. No passenger service was provided on other days. Overnight on 26 December 1946, several weakened support columns in <b>the</b> <b>quarry</b> gave way, resulting in a significant collapse; <b>the</b> <b>quarry</b> was deemed unsafe and closed immediately. Haydn Jones had promised to continue operating the railway {{as long as he}} was alive and so, despite the closure of <b>the</b> <b>quarry,</b> the railway continued to run trains on a shoestring budget. In 1947 the British railway system was nationalised and the Talyllyn was one of the few operating railways not included. The reasons for this are unclear, but it is significant that all official mention of the railway had ceased several decades before and it is likely that the line was simply forgotten by officialdom. Between 1947 and 1949 the railway ran a passenger service two days a week. In 1949 Haydn Jones, who owned the Aberllefenni Slate Quarry purchased 10 tons of rail from the recently lifted Corris Railway. On 2 July 1950 Haydn Jones died and closure of the railway seemed inevitable, but the line continued to operate for the remainder of the summer season, ending on 6 October.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} site of Ty Dwr the railway bends around 'Amen' corner and soon after the Village Incline is reached. From here the line runs into the gorge, high above the river on a narrow ledge, ending {{at the foot of}} the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The {{original}} line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used to marshal trains of loaded slate wagons coming down from <b>the</b> <b>quarry</b> and empty wagons waiting to ascend. Nant Gwernol station, the eastern terminus of the line, was built on {{the site of}} the sidings.|$|E
40|$|Geological {{drilling}} exploration is {{an essential}} activity when gaining information, which is important {{for control of the}} mining process. Quality of <b>the</b> <b>quarried</b> raw material, its spatial lay and its rock environment, which goes with <b>the</b> <b>quarried</b> mineral, have a deci-sive influence on the choice of the mining method, <b>the</b> way of <b>quarrying,</b> limitation of min...|$|R
50|$|The American Granite Company started {{quarrying}} {{operations in}} what is now Lohrville in 1906. The village was named for the company's first president, Charles Lohr. Lohrville's population grew as workers moved to the area seeking employment in <b>the</b> <b>quarries,</b> and <b>the</b> Chicago and North Western Railway Company built a spur line to <b>the</b> <b>quarries.</b> <b>The</b> village incorporated in 1910.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Rota <b>quarry</b> {{is known}} as <b>the</b> As Nieves <b>quarry.</b> <b>The</b> origin of <b>the</b> {{megalith}} <b>quarries</b> in <b>the</b> archipelago, it is the abandoned site of the largest unearthed latte stones in the Marianas. Nine haligi and seven tasa are found at <b>the</b> As Nieves <b>quarry.</b>|$|R
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>quarry</b> where Kate and Sawyer {{are working}} suffers an {{invasion}} by Alex (Tania Raymonde), who demands {{to know where}} her boyfriend Karl (Blake Bashoff) is, Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) brings Kate to talk to Jack, telling her {{that it is the}} only way to prevent Danny Pickett (Michael Bowen) from killing Sawyer. When Jack and Kate see each other, Kate asks him to operate on Ben to prevent Sawyer from getting killed, but Jack gets angry and refuses.|$|E
5|$|Bred {{primarily}} as hunting dogs, {{their goal is}} to find the bird, send it into the air and then to retrieve it on command after the hunter has shot <b>the</b> <b>quarry.</b> The Russian Spaniel is suited for hunting in marshland, fields, woodland, for birds as well as rabbits and other small game. The breed is also popular in their native Russia as their small size makes them suitable to be kept in busy cities, and easily transported to hunting sites.|$|E
5|$|Excavations at <b>the</b> <b>quarry</b> {{were stopped}} in 1881, {{although}} it was not exhausted of fossils, as recent drilling operations have shown. During World War I, when the town was occupied by German forces, preparations were made to reopen the mine for palaeontology, and Otto Jaekel was sent from Berlin to supervise. The Allies recaptured Bernissart just as the first fossiliferous layer was about to be uncovered. Further attempts to reopen the mine were hindered by financial problems and were stopped altogether in 1921 when the mine flooded.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} {{dominated}} by Barrow Hill, the remains of an extinct volcano. <b>The</b> effects of <b>quarrying</b> for dolerite can be clearly seen. <b>The</b> <b>quarrying</b> removed <b>the</b> two barrows (Bronze Age burial mounds) that gave the hill its name. Exposed rock faces in <b>the</b> <b>quarries</b> reveal volcanic features, such as hexagonal pillars that formed during the cooling of the magma.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> last active <b>quarry</b> {{closed in}} 1963. After their abandonment, <b>the</b> open <b>quarries</b> filled with {{rainwater}} and ground water. <b>The</b> flooded <b>quarries</b> {{soon became a}} popular spot for cliff jumping. However, many people were injured—and killed—while diving into <b>the</b> <b>quarries</b> from great heights. This led {{the police and the}} city of Quincy to grapple with what to do with this abandoned space.|$|R
5000|$|The city's {{name in the}} Ojibwe {{language}} is Asinikaaning, meaning [...] "At <b>the</b> <b>quarrying</b> place" [...] due to <b>the</b> sandstone <b>quarry</b> located at <b>the</b> edge of the city.|$|R
5|$|Further along {{from the}} Welsh Bridge is the Porthill Bridge, a {{pedestrian}} suspension bridge running between <b>the</b> <b>Quarry</b> and Porthill, built in 1922. The next bridge {{along the river}} is Kingsland Bridge, a privately owned toll bridge, and the subsequent bridge is the Greyfriars Bridge, a pedestrian bridge between Coleham and the town centre. Following the Greyfriars Bridge is the English Bridge, historically called Stone Bridge, which was rebuilt in the 1930s. Beyond it is the railway station, which is partly built over the river. After the station is Castle Walk Footbridge, another modern pedestrian footbridge.|$|E
5|$|Lake Waiau {{provided}} {{drinking water}} for the workers. Native chiefs would also dip the umbilical cords of newborn babies in its water, {{to give them the}} strength of the mountain. Use of <b>the</b> <b>quarry</b> declined between this period and contact with Americans and Europeans. As part of the ritual associated with quarrying, the workers erected shrines to their gods; these and other quarry artifacts remain at the sites, most of which lie within what is now the Mauna Kea Ice Age Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Many ragstone {{quarries}} {{have been}} abandoned and backfilled once exhausted. When Ditton Quarry closed down in 1984, quarrying operations had left behind a legacy of a lime-rich soil which formed {{the foundation of a}} thriving habitat for plants and wildlife; 140 wild flowers (including five that are rare in Kent), 18 butterfly species, and 50 bird species have been recorded. It is also home to foxes, rabbits, frogs, toads and newts. <b>The</b> <b>quarry</b> is now a Site of Nature Conservation Importance (SNCI). Public access is free.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2010 Welsh Slate {{announced}} <b>the</b> <b>quarry's</b> closure, due to {{the discovery}} of subsidence. [...] The remaining workers would be transferred to another of <b>the</b> company's <b>quarries.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{workforce}} {{for these}} quarries was initially taken from nearby {{towns and villages}} such as Ffestiniog and Maentwrog. Before the arrival of railways in the district, travel to <b>the</b> <b>quarries</b> was difficult and workers' houses were built near <b>the</b> <b>quarries.</b> These typically grew up around existing farms and along the roads between them. An early settlement was at Rhiwbryfdir, serving the Oakeley and Llechwedd quarries. As early as 1801, new roads were being built specifically to serve <b>the</b> <b>quarries.</b> By 1851, there were 3,460 {{people living in the}} new town of Blaenau Ffestiniog.|$|R
