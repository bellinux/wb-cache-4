Had the show not been renewed, SPE would have placed <b>the</b> <b>show</b> <b>on</b> extended hiatus for three years, reclaimed full rights to the show (without the innovations and format added in the syndicated run, to which DADT owns intellectual property rights), and shopped the revived show to another network or syndicator. In January 2017, it was announced that Millionaire has been renewed through 2018.|$|E
