500|$|The TV {{documentary}} [...] explored {{gay rights}} and homophobia in numerous {{countries in the}} world, including Russia. [...] In it, Fry interviews a lesbian couple who discuss their fears that simply being out to their 16-year-old daughter and her friends could be taken as breaking this law, due to the law's prohibition [...] "on anyone disseminating information about homosexuality to under 18s". [...] The LGBT news magazine The Advocate described the law as criminalising [...] "any positive discussion of LGBT people, identities, or issues in forums that might be accessible to minors. In practice, the law has given police broad license to interpret almost any mention of being LGBT [...] whether uttered, printed, or signified by waving a rainbow flag [...] as just cause to arrest LGBT people." [...] The US State Department in its 2013 report on human rights in Russia noted the clarification from Roskomnadzor (the Russian Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications) that the [...] "gay propaganda" [...] prohibited under the law includes materials which [...] "directly or indirectly approve {{of people who are}} in nontraditional sexual relationships." [...] One couple interviewed by Fry said: [...] "Of course we are afraid because we really don't know what's going <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>next</b> in the country. ... You just don't know if they can incarcerate you tomorrow for something or not." [...] Fry also interviewed politician Vitaly Milonov, the original proponent of the law, whose attempts to defend it have been strongly criticised; Milonov responded branding Fry as [...] "sick" [...] for making a suicide attempt while filming the documentary in an interview in which he also compared homosexuality with bestiality.|$|E

Very few Japanese could speak Formosan and fewer Formosans could speak Japanese. There was naturally mutual distrust and suspicion. The bandits abounded everywhere. Under these conditions military rule was the only form of government that could be adopted until better assurance could be obtained of the disposition of the people. For this purpose it was calculated that some ten million yen, I may say five million dollars, was yearly needed for the pacification and government of Formosa." ...|$|E

We've had Jewish schools burnt to the ground—not here but in France. People are attempting to silence and even ban Jewish societies on campuses on the grounds that Jews must support the state of Israel, therefore they should be banned, which is quite extraordinary because...
