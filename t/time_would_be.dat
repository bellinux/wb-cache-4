According to author Kate Deepwell, her works, and those of Vanessa Bell and other women, were evaluated differently at that time than those made by men: The best critique of woman's work at the <b>time</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> that they had individuality, but they would not have been considered innovative, modern works like those made by men.|$|E

This process was {{limited by the}} number of {{ordnance}} carts (used to handle the bombs and torpedoes) and ordnance elevators, preventing torpedoes from being stowed belowdeck until after all the bombs were moved up from their magazine, assembled, and mounted on the aircraft.

Around 07:40 Nagumo reversed his order when he received a message from one of his scout aircraft that American warships had been spotted. Depleted of ammunition, the first six of Sōryūs CAP Zeros landed aboard the carrier at 07:30.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2005–06 season, the NHL instituted several new rules. Some {{of them were}} already used by the IIHF, such as the shootout and making the two-line pass legal. Others which were not {{picked up by the}} IIHF, such as {{requiring}} smaller goaltender equipment and the addition of the goaltender trapezoid to the rink. However, the IIHF did agree to follow the NHL's league's zero-tolerance policy on obstruction and required referees to call more hooking, holding and interference penalties. In 2006, the IIHF voted to eliminate tie games and institute a three-point system: wins in regulation <b>time</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> worth three points, overtime wins would be two points and over-time losses would be worth one point. The system was first used at the 2007 World Championships.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} realized {{early on}} that issues relating to <b>time</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{an essential part of}} its case. At trial, each side presented witnesses to support their version of the timeline for the hours before and after the murder. The starting point was the time of death; the prosecution, relying on the analysis of stomach contents by their expert witness, argued that Phagan died between 12:00 and 12:15p.m. A prosecution witness, Monteen Stover, said she had gone into the office to get her paycheck, waiting there from 12:05 to 12:10, and did not see Frank in his office. The prosecution's theory was that Stover did not see Frank because he was at that time murdering Phagan. Stover's account did not match Frank's initial account that he had not left the office between noon and 12:30. Other testimony indicated that Phagan exited the trolley (or tram) between 12:07 and 12:10. From the stop it was a two- to four-minute walk, suggesting that Stover arrived first, making her testimony and its implications irrelevant: Frank could not be killing Phagan because at the time she had not yet arrived.|$|E

5|$|The {{remaining}} problem {{about the}} layer pyramid {{is the question}} of who had it built. Most scholars today believe that it was likely king Khaba of the late 3rd Dynasty. This conclusion is based on stone bowls and vases bearing the serekh of Khaba discovered in Mastaba Z500, located just north of the pyramid. Rainer Stadelmann goes further and identifies Khaba with king Huni, the last ruler of the 3rd Dynasty. His hypothesis is based on his reading of the Turin canon, a kinglist compiled in the early Ramesside period c. 1300 BC, some 1400 years after Huni's lifetime. The Turin canon credits Huni with a relatively long reign of 24 years. According to Stadelmann, this <b>time</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> sufficient to cover the time span needed to complete the building of the layer pyramid. He also argues that royal monuments of the first three Egyptian dynasties only present a king's horus name in a serekh and only later do they record the throne or birth name. Thus, the serekh of Khaba could correspond to the throne name Huni. In this case, the layer pyramid would be Huni's tomb. This conclusion is contested by most Egyptologists who think that Huni instead built the Meidum Pyramid, point to the apparent unfinished state of the layer pyramid and identify Khaba with king Hudjefa II mentioned on the Turin canon.|$|E
