5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s and 1940s, economists (notably John Hicks, Franco Modigliani, and Paul Samuelson) {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> and formalise Keynes's writings {{in terms of}} formal mathematical models.

5|$|New Zealand's judiciary, {{headed by}} the Chief Justice, {{includes}} the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, the High Court, and subordinate courts.

5|$|People {{sometimes}} suspected vampirism when a cadaver did {{not look}} as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred.

5|$|As {{with most}} undeciphered scripts, {{there are many}} fanciful interpretations and claimed {{translations}} of rongorongo. However, apart from a portion of one tablet which {{has been shown to}} have to do with a lunar Rapa Nui calendar, none of the texts are understood. There are three serious obstacles to decipherment, assuming rongorongo is truly writing: the small number of remaining texts, the lack of context such as illustrations in which <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> them, and the poor attestation of the Old Rapanui language, since modern Rapanui is heavily mixed with Tahitian and is therefore unlikely to closely reflect the language of the tablets.|$|E
5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks <b>to</b> <b>interpret</b> and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E
