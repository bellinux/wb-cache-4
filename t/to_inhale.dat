5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This {{is partly due to}} the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has <b>to</b> <b>inhale</b> more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.|$|E
5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user <b>to</b> <b>inhale</b> the smoke.|$|E

5|$|Lung {{function}} {{testing is}} carried out by evaluating a person's capacity <b>to</b> <b>inhale</b> and exhale in different circumstances. The volume of air inhaled and exhaled by a person at rest is the tidal volume (normally 500-750mL); the inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory reserve volume are the additional amounts a person is able to forcibly inhale and exhale respectively. The summed total of forced inspiration and expiration is a person's vital capacity. Not all air is expelled from the lungs even after a forced breath out; {{the remainder of the}} air is called the residual volume. Together these terms are referred to as lung volumes.|$|E

Exposure to zinc oxide in the air, which also occurs while welding galvanized (zinc plated) steel, can result in a nervous malady called metal fume fever. For this reason, typically galvanized steel is not welded, or the zinc is removed first.|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackgroundLong-acting-β-agonists {{and inhaled}} {{corticosteroids}} {{are widely used}} in patients with obstructive lung disease. We determined the occurrence of potential side effects <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> steroids and long-acting-β-agonists in an open post-marketing observational study. MethodsA total of 158 adult patients treated with long-acting-β-agonists and inhaled steroids because of asthma or chronic obstructive lung disease were included prospectively in a cross-sectional study from September 2004 through august 2005. A subgroup of 31 patients with minimal disease were observed prospectively after treatment reduction. The frequency and intensity of potential side effects <b>to</b> long-acting-β-agonists and <b>inhaled</b> corticosteroids were registered on a 10 -point visual analogue scale. ResultsA total of 131 (83 %) reported potential side effects <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> steroids. The most frequent were sore (54 %) and dry (52 %) throat. A total of 114 (72 %) patients reported potential side effects to long-acting-β-agonists. The most frequent were muscle cramps (62 %) and muscle twisting (39 %). For 5 / 8 potential side effects their occurrence increased with increased individual dozing. In 31 patients the mean medication with steroids and long-acting-β-agonists was reduced by 87 % and 97. 5 %, respectively, with side effects reduced by 62 % (p< 0. 001) <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> steroids and by 91 % (p< 0. 001) <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> long-acting-β-agonists. ConclusionsPotential side effects in adult patients <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> corticosteroids and long-acting-β-agonists are very common with increased frequency with increased dozing. Patients are largely unaware of the association. Patients should be better informed, and the results further support tailored dozing to minimum therapy...|$|R
40|$|Endothelins (ETs) are {{a family}} of peptide {{mediators}} that {{have a number of}} biological properties, including the ability to act as potent bronchoconstrictors of isolated human airways. Moreover, elevated concentrations of ET- 1 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with symptomatic asthma have also been detected. We investigated the possible contribution of ET- 1 in the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and the role of inflammatory cell accumulation in rabbit lungs. Our data show that ET- 1 challenge to rabbits does not modify basal lung function but results in an increased airway responsiveness <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> histamine. Endothelin-treated rabbits were 3 -fold (P< 0. 01) more responsive <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> histamine when compared with vehicle-treated rabbits. This hyperresponsiveness was not associated with an alteration in either total or differential inflammatory cell numbers as assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Pre-treatment with capsaicin (80 mg/kg s. c.) did not alter basal lung function or basal responsiveness <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> histamine. While capsaicin had no significant effect on the acute bronchoconstriction induced by endothelin- 1, this dose was sufficient to significantly inhibit the increase in airway responsiveness <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> histamine, achieved 24 h following endothelin- 1 challenge. These results indicate that ET- 1 {{may play a role in}} the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> histamine and that the maintenance of this state is unrelated to a detectable alteration in cellular infiltration within the airway lumen, but probably via the involvement of capsaicin-sensitive nerves...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIncreased {{levels of}} exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> {{mannitol}} {{are related to}} allergic inflammation characterized by eosinophil infiltration and a clinical response to treatment with anti-inflammatory agents in subjects with asthma. This study determines the diagnostic accuracy of FeNO using absolute and normalized values to predict the presence of AHR <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> mannitol in an unselected population. Levels of FeNO and AHR <b>to</b> <b>inhaled,</b> dry-powder mannitol was measured in 180 unselected, steroid-naïve, non-smoking adolescents and young adults. The area under the curve for the receiver operating characteristics curve for FeNO to identify a positive response to mannitol was 91. 9 % (CI 95 : 87. 7 – 96. 2). The optimal cut-off was 25  ppb (185 % predicted) and a sensitivity of 100 % (CI 95 : 83. 9 – 100. 0) was achieved below 20  ppb (165 % predicted). FeNO is a sensitive and specific tool for predicting the response <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> mannitol in an unselected sample of non-smoking, steroid-naïve subjects, and a low FeNO indicates that extra diagnostic work-up using inhaled mannitol will add very little extra information...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Objective: Interleukin 8 protein {{promotes}} inflammatory responses, even in airways. The {{presence of}} interleukin 8 gene variants causes altered inflammatory responses and possibly varied responses <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> bronchodilators. Thus, this study analyzed the interleukin 8 variants (rs 4073, rs 2227306, and rs 2227307) and {{their association with}} the response <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> bronchodilators in cystic fibrosis patients. Methods: Analysis of interleukin 8 gene variants was performed by {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} of polymerase chain reaction. The association between spirometry markers and the response <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> bronchodilators was evaluated by Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests. The analysis included all cystic fibrosis patients, and subsequently patients with two mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene belonging to classes I to III. Results: This study included 186 cystic fibrosis patients. There was no association of the rs 2227307 variant with the response <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> bronchodilators. The rs 2227306 variant was associated with FEF 50 % in the dominant group and in the group with two identified mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. The rs 4073 variant was associated with spirometry markers in four genetic models: co-dominant (FEF 25 - 75 % and FEF 75 %), dominant (FEV 1, FEF 50 %, FEF 75 %, and FEF 25 - 75 %), recessive (FEF 75 % and FEF 25 - 75 %), and over-dominant (FEV 1 /FVC). Conclusions: This study highlighted the importance of the rs 4073 variant of the interleukin 8 gene, regarding response <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> bronchodilators, and of the assessment of mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene...|$|R

Moreover, among those occupationally exposed to organic dusts, {{the progression of}} airflow obstruction {{is related to the}} endotoxin concentration in the bioaerosol. Not everyone exposed to high concentrations of LPS develops these problems. To determine whether individuals express a differential response <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> LPS, we challenged 72 healthy volunteers with increasing doses of LPS. Airflow was assessed after each dose and the protocol was terminated for decline in FEV 1 � 20 %. Marked differences in the response <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> LPS were observed: eight “sensitive ” subjects had at least 20 % decline in their FEV 1 after inhaling 6. 5 �g or less of LPS, whereas 11 “hyporesponsive ” subjects maintained an FEV 1 � 90 % of their baseline even after inhaling 41. 5 �g of LPS.

5|$|Methods of euthanizing {{laboratory}} {{animals are}} chosen to induce rapid unconsciousness and death without pain or distress. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal {{can be made}} <b>to</b> <b>inhale</b> a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) {{may be used for}} birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. Maceration (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce unconsciousness.|$|E

40|$|Enhanced cough {{response}} has been frequently observed in chronic cough. Recently, extrathoracic airway constriction <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> histamine was demonstrated in some chronic cough patients. However, relation between extrathoracic airway hyperresponsiveness (EAHR) and cough sensitivity determined by capsaicin inhalation is unclear in each etiological entity of chronic cough. Seventy-seven patients, with dry cough persisting for 3 or more weeks, normal spirometry and chest radiography, and 15 controls, underwent methacholine bronchial provocation test and capsaicin cough provocation test. Elicited cough number and flowvolume curve was examined after inhalation of capsaicin to evaluate cough sensitivity and EAHR. Thirty-three patients, with postnasal drip, showed normal extrathoracic airway responsiveness, and 27 of them showed normal cough sensitivity to capsaicin. Cough sensitivity was enhanced in 14 patients with cough variant asthma (CVA) who showed bronchial hyperresponsiveness; EAHR <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> capsaicin was present in 12 of them. The remaining 30 patients were tentatively diagnosed as idiopathic chronic cough (ICC). Eleven ICC patients showed enhanced cough sensitivity and EAHR <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> capsaicin while 19 patients showed normal values.

We report a prospective, protocol-driven transition from parenteral prostanoids <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> prostanoids with monitoring of exercise gas exchange and acute hemodynamics. Three PAH centers recruited patients transitioning from parenteral prostanoids <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> trepostinil. Rigid inclusion criteria were used, including parenteral prostanoid dose < 30 ng/kg/min, New York Heart Association functional class (FC) < 3, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) < 6 Wood units. Of the 9 patients meeting initial inclusion criteria, 3 were excluded. In the remaining patients, the parenteral prostanoid was reduced and the inhaled prostanoid was increased over 24 - 36 hours with continuous hemodynamic monitoring. Exercise capacity and FC were measured at baseline and weeks 1, 4, and 12. All patients were successfully weaned from parenteral prostanoids. An acute PVR decrease was seen with most inhaled prostanoid doses, but PVR varied throughout the transition. Patients tolerated inhaled prostanoids for 9 - 12 breaths 4 times a day with no treatment-limiting adverse events.

40|$|LPS from {{bacteria}} is {{ubiquitous in}} the environment and can cause airway disease and modify allergic asthma. Identification of gene products that modulate the biologic response <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> LPS will improve our understanding of inflammatory airways disease. Previous work has identified quantitative trait loci for the response <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> LPS on chromosomes 2 and 11. In these regions, 28 genes had altered RNA expression after inhalation of LPS, including CD 44, which was associated with differences in both TNF- � levels and neutrophil recruitment into the lung. It has previously been shown that CD 44 can modulate macrophage recruitment in response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as clearance of neutrophils after lung injury with both bleomycin and live Escherichia coli bacteria. In this study, we demonstrate that the biologic response <b>to</b> <b>inhaled</b> LPS is modified by CD 44. Macrophages failed to be recruited to the lungs of CD 44 -deficient animals at all time points after LPS exposure. CD 44 -deficient macrophages showed reduced motility in a Transwell migration assay, reduced ability to secrete the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-�, reduced in vivo migration in response to monocyte chemotactic protein- 1, and diminished adhesion to vascular endothelia {{in the presence of}} TNF-�. In addition, CD 44 deficient animals had 150 % fewer neutrophils at 24 h and 50 % greater neutrophils 48 h after LPS exposure.
