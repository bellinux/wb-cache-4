5|$|The {{inscriptions}} {{follow the}} 14th-century convention of showing figures, imagery and motifs {{associated with the}} saved to Christ's right, {{and those of the}} damned to his left. The words beneath the lily (the benedicti) read upwards towards Heaven, their curves leaning in towards Christ. The text to the left (the maledicti) flows in the opposite direction; from the highest point downwards. The inscriptions to Christ's right are decorated in light colours, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are usually difficult to discern in reproductions. The lettering opposite faces downwards, and is applied with black paint.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} to Gujarat, Swaminarayan by His preaching and super natural divine power restored noted notorious criminals as normal civilians. These criminals left their evil nature and started living life with high moral values to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would never rob, or kill any living being. Even {{they would not}} see the unknown women or would not drink alcohol and be strict vegetarian. Bombay Governor Sir Malcolm was impressed by social reforms of Swaminarayan and so had come down to Rajkot to meet Swaminarayan personally and to appreciate His work towards educating high moral values {{to the people of}} Gujarat and helping British Government in reducing criminal graph of Gujarat. Swaminarayan had vowed not to kill the evil people but to kill their evil nature.|$|E
50|$|Kőnig {{worked in}} many {{mathematical}} fields. His work on polynomial ideals, discriminants and elimination theory {{can be considered}} as a link between Leopold Kronecker and David Hilbert as well as Emmy Noether. Later on his ideas were simplified considerably, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> today <b>they</b> are only of historical interest.|$|R
5000|$|In addition, the [...] "friction not fiction" [...] {{doctrine}} {{indicates that}} the courts can approve the application state laws to federal enclaves to <b>the</b> same <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> apply to <b>the</b> other 97 percent of federal lands (i.e., subject only to {{the limitations of the}} Supremacy Clause). With regard to the states' ability unilaterally to apply their laws on federal enclaves, Evans noted that enclave residents: ...|$|R
25|$|Each large shock {{had a high}} {{intensity}} and was felt over roughly the same geographical area. The area over which the initial shock was felt with an intensity of VIII (Severe) was about 1,100km2 and the area for the second shock was about 890km2. <b>The</b> furthest <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were felt was from Redding in the north to Salinas and Fresno {{in the south and}} to Virginia City, Nevada in the east.|$|R
5|$|By {{becoming}} chef de canton, Houphouët assumed {{responsibility for}} the administration of Akouè, a canton which comprised 36 villages. He also {{took charge of the}} family plantation—at the time {{one of the most important}} in the country—and worked to diversify its rubber, cocoa and coffee crops. He soon became one of Africa's richest farmers. On 3 September 1944, he established, in cooperation with the colonial administration, the African Agricultural Union (Syndicat agricole africain, SAA). Under his presidency, the SAA brought together African farmers who were dissatisfied with their working conditions and worked to protect their interests against those of European planters. Anti-colonialist and anti-racist, the organisation demanded better working conditions, higher wages, and the abolition of unfree labor. The union quickly received the support of nearly 20,000 plantation workers, together with that of the left-wing French administrators placed in office by the Provisional Government. Its success irritated colonists to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> took legal action against Houphouët, accusing him of being anti-French for never seeking French citizenship. However, Houphouët befriended the Inspector Minister of the Colonies, who ordered the charges dropped. They were more successful in obtaining the replacement of the sympathetic Governor André Latrille with the hostile Governor Henry de Mauduit.|$|E
5|$|Copper toxicosis, {{also known}} as copper storage disease and copper {{overload}} syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disease that is characterized by an accumulation of copper in the liver. It {{is closely related to}} Wilson's disease in humans. Bedlington Terriers are more prone to copper toxicosis than most other dog breeds. West Highland White Terriers, Skye Terriers, and Doberman Pinschers are also prone to copper storage disease. Bedlington Terriers are the only breed of dog in which haemolysis has been reported, but there have been no reports of neurological involvement in any dog breed. Studies have shown that in Bedlingtons, the disease is caused by a defective metallothionein that causes cell lysosomes to become saturated with copper. This causes the cell to store copper in the nucleus. There are three varieties of the disease: the Asymptomatic Form occurs when copper accumulates but there are no clinical symptoms of the disorder; the Fulminating Form which is seen mostly in young dogs, causes death in two to three days, and is thought to be caused by stress; and the Chronic Form, which is characterized by {{an extended period of time}} in which liver disease slowly causes the death of the dog. Bedlingtons also have a tendency to accumulate iron in the liver, but not nearly to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> accumulate copper.|$|E
5|$|Resuming their advance, the Australians were {{supported}} by three squadrons of Corsairs from the Royal New Zealand Air Force—Nos. 14, 22 and 26 Squadrons—which bombed and strafed {{the ground in front}} of the advancing infantry, as well as a creeping barrage of artillery and mortar fire. With such strong support the Japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the 24th Infantry Battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the Hongorai, for just one man wounded. Further progress was made over the next week, but on 4 May the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun, mines and other improvised explosive devices. After this, the 15th Brigade's engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the Japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the Australian armour, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the Australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines. The Japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also. To negate the effectiveness of the Australian tanks, the Japanese began to position themselves off the roads, forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support. Additionally, the Japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry, which they kept under constant observation and fire.|$|E
50|$|Mozart {{continued}} to be sung throughout the 19th century although, generally speaking, his operas were not revered to <b>the</b> same <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are today by music critics and audiences. Back then, baritones rather than high basses normally sang Don Giovanni - arguably Mozart's greatest male operatic creation. Famous Dons of the late 19th and early 20th centuries included Scotti and Maurel, as well as Portugal's Francisco De Andrade and Sweden's John Forsell.|$|R
50|$|However, {{unlike the}} other colonial city state of Asia, Hong Kong, rugby has not been quite so {{successful}} in Singapore. The tragic events of the Second World War and the Japanese occupation of Singapore also disrupted its growth. Between 1945 and 1991, a regiment of New Zealanders was based in Singapore, and during those years they dominated the game to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> when <b>they</b> left, <b>the</b> Singaporean rugby scene almost fell apart.|$|R
2500|$|The Persian ruler Khosrau II (Parviz) {{defeated}} {{a dangerous}} rebellion {{within his own}} empire, the Bahram Chobin's rebellion. He afterward turned his energies towards his traditional Byzantine enemies, leading to the Byzantine-Sassanid War of 602–628. For a few years, he succeeded gloriously. From 612 to 622, he extended the Persian borders almost to <b>the</b> same <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were under <b>the</b> Achaemenid dynasty (550–330BC), capturing [...] Western states as far as Egypt, Palestine (the conquest of the latter being assisted by a Jewish army), and more.|$|R

25|$|Protestants too see the {{authority}} {{given to the}} apostles as unique, proper to the apostles alone, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> generally reject {{the idea of a}} succession of bishops to the apostles in governing the Church. Their view of ecclesiastical authority is accordingly different.|$|E
25|$|Challenge {{of gifts}} (Schenkungsanfechtung / cas de libéralités): Gratuitous or {{effectively}} gratuitous transfers of assets by the debtor may be challenged if they took place {{within a year}} prior to the seizure of assets or the bankruptcy. Good-faith recipients of a gift must return it only to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> remain enriched by it.|$|E
40|$|The use of {{predictive}} microbiology models able to evaluate bacterial behaviour {{as a function}} of environmental conditions and, at the same time, of natural microflora competition was considered by several authors with different approaches. Some authors modelled bacterial competition {{as a function of}} metabolic product with particular regard to lactic acid and modelled interspecific bacterial competition introducing a term into a conventional primary predictive model, which gives account for the interaction between two populations, so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> inhibit each other to <b>the</b> same <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> inhibit their own growth...|$|R
50|$|Condor's success {{encouraged}} the Oldenburg breeders to choose French sires over German ones. Prominent among these were Furioso II in 1968 and Futuro in 1969, both by Furioso xx, Tiro, and Zeus, who was by French Anglo-Arabian Arlequin x. There {{was also the}} Trakehner, Magister, though Trakehners were not used in Oldenburg to <b>the</b> same <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were in neighboring Hannover. In 1972 added flair came to the Oldenburg from the French Anglo-Arabian stallion, Inschallah x, who donated his expressive gaits and dry features to his offspring.|$|R
40|$|Adult female cercopithecines {{have long}} been known to bias their social {{behaviour}} towards close maternal kin. However, much less is understood about the behaviour of paternal kin, especially in wild populations. Here, we show that wild adult female baboons bias their affiliative behaviour towards their adult paternal half-sisters {{in the same manner}} and to <b>the</b> same <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> bias their behaviour towards adult maternal half-sisters. Females appear to rely heavily on social familiarity as a means of biasing their behaviour towards paternal half-sisters, but may use phenotype matching as well...|$|R
25|$|Before {{the claims}} are met, secured {{creditors}} {{are entitled to}} enforce their claims against {{the assets of the}} company to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are subject to a valid security interest. In most legal systems, only fixed security takes precedence over all claims; security by way of floating charge may be postponed to the preferential creditors.|$|E
25|$|So {{the basic}} {{principle}} of this monumental sculpture {{is that to}} <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could be picked up and transported, these signals could be enlarged, translated into colors and shapes, and show the plant’s « decisions ». This permanent show, installed in a public place, would suggest a level of fundamental biological activity.|$|E

5000|$|Chappelle {{was seen}} as having tough contenders by the {{newspapers}} that followed the elections to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> sometimes <b>they</b> thought he would not win. “Mr. Julius C. Chappelle, the colored man on the Ward 9 Republican representative ticket, is evidently to be sacrificed by his friends of his white associate. The Journal significantly hints that ‘the Republicans of Ward 9 should {{see to it that}} Henry Parkman is elected to the house by a good majority.’” [...] Yet, Chappelle was reelected, defeating Robert Hooper, the son of Hon. Samuel Hooper.|$|R
50|$|Many {{hundreds}} {{of people have been}} employed on the waterfront in Cairns over the years. Most working activity at the Cairns wharves has shifted upstream to newer wharf developments, including the bulk sugar terminals, built in the 1960s. These earlier wharves are used mainly for recreational vessels and passenger liners, but not to <b>the</b> capacity or <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were used in the past.|$|R
50|$|All {{engine-powered}} {{modes of}} transport {{can be affected}} by fuel starvation, although the problem is most serious for aircraft in flight. Ships are affected to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> without propulsion <b>they</b> cannot maneuver to avoid collisions or beaching. On aircraft, fuel starvation is often the result of incorrect fuel management, for example by selecting to feed the engine from an empty tank, while fuel is present in another one.|$|R
25|$|David Ward King (October 27, 1857 – February 9, 1920) was an American {{farmer and}} {{inventor}} of the King road drag. His invention, which was the horse-drawn forerunner of the modern road grader, had a great influence on American life because his invention improved the widespread dirt roads of his day to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could accommodate {{the advent of the}} automobile, rural mail delivery and mail order catalogues.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this work}} has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan {{highlighted}} that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from 3 different IQ tests.|$|E
25|$|Orthodox Judaism {{considers}} {{itself to}} be in direct continuity with historical rabbinic Judaism. Therefore, as above, it accepts philosophic speculation and statements of dogma only to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> exist within, and are compatible with, the system of written and oral Torah. As a matter of practice Orthodox Judaism lays stress {{on the performance of}} the actual commandments. Dogma is considered to be the self-understood underpinning of the practice of the Mitzvot.|$|E
50|$|In 1919 the {{remaining}} nuns {{returned to the}} mainstream Cistercian mode of life, and were incorporated into the Trappist Order in 1922, {{under the supervision of}} Westmalle Abbey, as their original supervisory community of monks, Aulne Abbey, had ceased to function. Under this new direction Soleilmont again flourished, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> in 1950 <b>they</b> were able to provide the 13 nuns needed to establish the new foundation of Brecht Abbey.|$|R
50|$|Lee played {{every minute}} of the Spireites' championship-winning 2010-11 season. His fine form was rewarded as he {{was placed in the}} PFA Team of the Year for that season. In September 2011, Lee was injured in a game against Bury. The side missed him to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> without him <b>they</b> began a long series of matches without winning and slumped {{to the bottom of the}} League One table.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} subtle {{differences}} between CA signed and self-signed certificates, {{especially in the}} amount of trust that can be placed in the security assertions of the certificate. Some CAs can verify the identity of the person to whom they issue a certificate; for example the US military issues their Common Access Cards in person, with multiple forms of other ID. The CA can attest identity values like these by including them in the signed certificate. The entity that validates the certificate can trust the information in that certificate, to <b>the</b> same <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> trust <b>the</b> CA that signed it (and by implication, the security procedures the CA used to verify the attested information).|$|R
25|$|Proponents of a {{strongly}} unitary theory {{argue that the}} president possesses all of the executive power and can therefore control subordinate officers and agencies of the executive branch. This implies {{that the power of}} Congress to remove executive agencies or officers from Presidential control is limited. Thus, under the strongly unitary executive theory, independent agencies and counsels are unconstitutional to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> exercise discretionary executive power not controlled by the president.|$|E
25|$|China’s {{claims to}} {{historic}} rights, or other sovereign rights or jurisdiction, {{with respect to}} the maritime areas of the South China Sea encompassed by the relevant part of the ‘nine-dash line’ are contrary to the Convention and without lawful effect to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> exceed the geographic and substantive limits of China’s maritime entitlements under the Convention. The Convention superseded any historic rights or other sovereign rights or jurisdiction in excess of the limits imposed therein.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} interglacial {{period and the}} most recent {{glaciation}} of the Pleistocene (from 131,000 till 12,000 BP), Europe was very different from the Balkans. The glaciations did not affect southeastern Europe to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did in the northern and central regions. The evidence of forest and steppe indicate the influence was not so drastic; some species of flora and fauna survived only in the Balkans. The Balkans today still abound in species endemic only to this part of Europe.|$|E
50|$|In 2002, when Martin Creed {{won with}} lights {{going on and}} off in an empty room, they flicked {{flashlights}} on and off outside, and in 2003 displayed a blow-up sex doll to parody Jake and Dinos Chapman's bronze (painted) sculpture modelled on one, by claiming they had the original. Although barred from the prize ceremony, they have succeeded in infiltrating it psychologically to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> twice <b>they</b> have been mentioned by the guest of honour on live TV, just before {{the announcement of the}} winner. They have also handed out manifestos to arriving guests at the Tate (and the Saatchi Gallery), thus getting their message carried into the events from which they were excluded.|$|R
50|$|The Blumenthal family, who {{had lost}} {{everything}} in the hyperinflation, moved to Neustrelitz in 1926. Educated at the Potsdam Gymnasium until 1928, followed by the Realgymnasium there, Blumenthal studied law and economics for two years at the Universities of Königsberg and Munich. He {{was a close friend}} of the eldest son of the last Crown Prince of Prussia, Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> people said <b>they</b> behaved like twins.|$|R
50|$|The team {{returned}} a year later, and {{slowly began to}} improve performances, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> by 1992-93 <b>they</b> reached the play-offs for third level for the first time. Promotion via this way was to prove a tortuous affair however, with regular high finishes {{in the regular season}} amounting to nothing in the knockout stages: the first disappointment occurred in 1992-93 when, after finishing the season third, they lost 1-3 on aggregate to Atlético Malagueño.|$|R
