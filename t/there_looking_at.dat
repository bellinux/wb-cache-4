500|$|At the iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas on September 24, 2011, Gaga {{dedicated}} {{a performance}} of [...] "Hair" [...] to deceased teenager Jamey Rodemeyer, who had committed suicide after being constantly bullied by his peers at school for being gay. An image of Rodemeyer was shown on the backdrop as Gaga announced: [...] "We lost a Little Monster this week. I wrote this record about how your identity is really all you've got when you're in school... so tonight, Jamey, I know you're up <b>there</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> us, and you're not a victim... you're a lesson to all of us. I know it's {{a bit of a}} downer, but sometimes the right thing {{is more important than the}} music", after which she sang a piano version of [...] "Hair".|$|E
500|$|The show's {{crew and}} actors had {{a range of}} {{opinions}} about the show's finale, [...] "The Truth". Carter said of the finale, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract from what was going on. The band was breaking up." [...] Gish said, [...] "It did feel like a big movie set. We were on location, there was an enormous budget, and everyone came back." [...] Davis said, [...] "It was great that they brought us all back in the finale, that they {{found a way to}} get us all in again." [...] Pileggi said, [...] "I can remember the last day on the set. We shot a scene with Gillian and myself, and that was it. And then I had to say goodbye to another family, another crew. I almost teared up, and Gillian was standing <b>there</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> me saying 'Okay, go ahead, big guy; get through this.' It was tough." [...] Patrick said, [...] "It was pretty euphoric, and sad, and all those emotions you can imagine. A chapter's closing, and we're all moving on to something new and exciting. And yet we were all going to miss each other." [...] Kim Manners called the final scene [...] "truly one of the most emotional experiences I've ever witnessed in my life." [...] Former lead actor Duchovny said, [...] "In some ways, psychically I didn't really leave. It was {{nice to be able to}} – I'm just really happy that I was able to come back and finish it." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{manufacturer}} {{shook his}} head sorrowfully and sat down, and remained <b>there,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "Alive? {{of course}} I am! You don't suppose I {{am going to}} be frightened at a lot of bats? <b>There,</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them, they are still {{streaming}} out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't gone {{to buying}} yet," [...] the half-caste explained, [...] "so the account is intact. I'll just indorse {{it over to}} you, Grief. It's for fifteen thousand. <b>There,</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come this way, {{into the}} front room. <b>There,</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him--is it not nice to see him, so {{perfectly}} simple and at his ease, neither shy nor elated? And what a fine-looking fellow he is!" ...|$|R
60|$|Presently {{something}} {{caused her}} to open her eyes and she saw Gaston de Stainville standing <b>there</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her intently.|$|E
60|$|The {{policeman}} stood <b>there</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{me for a}} moment, {{and then}} 'e began to laugh till he couldn't stop 'imself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Falling in {{love and}} dogging my footsteps," [...] said Rosa, with relish, [...] "and {{standing}} <b>there</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> me as though you could eat me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Here he is, now!' cried {{those who}} stood near Ernest. 'There! <b>There!</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> Old Stony Phiz {{and then at}} the Old Man of the Mountain, and see if they are not as like as two twin brothers!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold on, now, that's too much!" [...] Bill {{dropped the}} trunk {{to the floor}} with a bang, {{straightened}} up, and thrust his hand into his inside coat pocket. [...] "I told you I was only kiddin'. <b>There,</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{documentary}} then {{shifts to}} the American Museum of Natural History. Scientists <b>there</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> {{the film and}} make comments. Professor Will Harcourt-Smith and Dr. Esteban Sarmiento explain the limits of fossil evidence and the hope that this family might provide {{a new source of}} evidence.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are {{you going}} to keep me here all night without anything?" [...] he then said. [...] "Let me have some whisky,--hot, with;--and don't stand <b>there</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> nothing." ...|$|E
60|$|Neither of 'em {{answered}} 'er, but {{the next}} night they both turned up as usual, and Emma White stood <b>there</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> 'em and nearly crying with temper.|$|E
60|$|But {{it would}} not do to {{continue}} <b>there,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her. She might be a very shy person, and if I appeared shy it would probably make her all the shyer; so I spoke.|$|E
60|$|Wells's {{face was}} <b>there.</b> He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it {{and saw that}} Wells was afraid.|$|R

60|$|KEEGAN [pulling him up]. You bosthoon, you! Don't you {{see that}} it only whistled to tell me Miss Reilly's comin? <b>There!</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> her and pull {{yourself}} together for shame. Off widja to the road: you'll be late for the car if you don't make haste [bustling him down the hill]. I can see the dust {{of it in the}} gap already.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} 'im hard, but 'e stood <b>there</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{me with his}} fat baby- face, and I knew he didn't mean any harm; so I {{answered}} 'im perlite and wished 'im good night.|$|E
60|$|The two of 'em stood <b>there</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{each other}} for a minute, and then my wife, holding the letter between 'er finger and thumb as if it was pison, passed it to Mrs. Smithers.|$|E
60|$|They both stood <b>there</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> me {{with their}} mouths open, and then afore I knew wot he was up to, the {{policeman}} came close {{up to me and}} scratched my chest with his finger-nail.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. Go to the milestone, {{and take}} care that nobody sees you when you get <b>there.</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> {{the back of the}} stone. If you {{discover}} an Object which appears to have been left in that situation on the ground, bring it to me; and don't forget that the most impatient man in all Ireland is waiting for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So's an Irish terrier a lion dog. Take {{that one}} <b>there.</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> {{the size and}} weight of him. Also, take it from me, he's all spunk. He'll stand up to anything. Try him out. I'll lend him to you. If he makes good I'll sell him to you cheap. An Irish terrier for a leopard dog will be a novelty." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{knew not}} what she dreaded, or what hoped; but {{remained}} <b>there,</b> motionless, <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the porch by which they had disappeared.|$|R
60|$|The cabman {{climbed down}} off 'is box {{and looked in}} at the winder, and for over two minutes he couldn't speak a word. He just stood <b>there</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Sam and getting purpler and purpler about the face.|$|E
60|$|All at {{once the}} bedroom door opened softly, and Helene was {{standing}} <b>there,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> me. At first I saw her dimly, as in a vision, then clearly. I leaped {{to my feet and}} went and stood beside her.|$|E
60|$|I stood <b>there</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> 'im, but he couldn't meet my eye. None of 'em could; and arter {{waiting there}} {{for a minute or two}} to give 'em a chance, I turned my back on 'em and went off to my dooty.|$|E
6000|$|Taking {{a silver}} lamp from the wall, the imaum beckoned to Godwin, who {{bowed to the}} Sultan and followed. As he passed wearily through the throng in the {{audience}} room, it seemed to Godwin that the emirs and captains gathered <b>there</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him with pity in their eyes. So strong was this feeling in him that he halted in his walk, and asked: ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Janet {{advanced}} {{no further}} than the threshold. She stood <b>there</b> and <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her nephew and her adopted daughter in stern silence.|$|R
6000|$|... "While I am poor," [...] said Nina; [...] "so poor that--look here, I {{can only}} mend my rags. <b>There,</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> my shoes. I have not another pair to my feet. But if he likes me, poor and ragged, {{better than he}} likes you, rich--" [...] She got so far, raising her voice as she spoke; but she could get no farther, for her sobs stopped her voice.|$|R
60|$|I stood <b>there,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> her dumbly, hating {{myself for}} being {{the cause of the}} anxiety in her eyes. If I had struck her, I could not have felt more despicable. In my misery I cursed Cynthia for leading me into this tangle.|$|E
60|$|He {{held his}} 'and under Ginger's nose, and Ginger stood <b>there</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it and opening and {{shutting}} 'is {{mouth like a}} dying fish. Then he took Peter {{by the arm and}} led'im away while the nevy was opening 'is new watch and showing Sam the works.|$|E
60|$|He {{pointed to}} a distance, and then {{he and the others}} hurried to the spot. <b>There,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the work which was going on around a new well, were the man and the boy they had once rescued from the freshet on the Rick Rack River.|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Columbine, I shore hope so," [...] replied Burley, much {{embarrassed and}} distressed. Like most men of his kind, {{he could not}} bear to hurt a woman. [...] "But it looks bad fer Moore.... See hyar! <b>There!</b> <b>Look</b> <b>at</b> the tracks of his hoss--left front foot-shoe all crooked. Thet's his hoss's. He {{acknowledges}} thet.

6000|$|She {{came toward}} him. [...] "But {{how can they}} send you to the surface?" [...] She took his face in her shaking hands, making him <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her. <b>There</b> was a strange hunger in her eyes.

6000|$|I went to {{the third}} counter to the right, and showed my sample to the {{salesman}} in attendance <b>there.</b> He <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it on both sides. Then he said: ...|$|R
