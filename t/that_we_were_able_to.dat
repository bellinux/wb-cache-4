Kvapil {{replaced}} Mark Martin in the truck, who moved to Ginn Racing, and David Ragan, who was promoted to replace Martin in the No. 6 Ford in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Jack Roush, excited about signing with Kvapil, said, “We are pleased beyond measure <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> get a driver the caliber of Travis Kvapil. At only 30 years old with a Truck championship and two years of Sprint Cup experience under his belt, Travis brings great long and short term potential to and for Roush Racing.” He finished the season with four wins, three poles, eight Top 5's and 12 Top 10's. He finished the season sixth in the driver point standings. He returned to Roush Fenway Racing as a part-time driver in 2008 when Joey Clanton was released from the No. 09 Ford.|$|E

In 1930 came belated {{recognition}} from London—the Royal Geographical Society awarded him its Patron's Medal, proclaiming that {{the magnitude of the}} difficulties overcome by Borchgrevink had initially been underestimated: [...] "It was only after the work of Scott's Northern Party... <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> realise the improbability that any explorer could do more in the Cape Adare district than Mr Borchgrevink had accomplished.

[...] "We wanted to make sure we had some new sounds and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> go to new places." [...] Co-executive producer Vito Luprano added: [...] "The first idea was to record three new songs, then Dion said, 'Let's go for five,' her lucky number.

500|$|Revelations uses a ported and {{downsized}} {{version of}} the internally developed MT Framework graphics engine, which was originally designed for high definition (HD) games such as Devil May Cry 4 and Lost Planet 2. Capcom's previous experience with The Mercenaries 3D helped the development team improve the technical and graphical aspects of the game to a greater extent. According to Nakanishi, [...] "It was thanks to the tremendous efforts of our technical team <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> get console-quality graphics from portable hardware." [...] Some techniques were used to reduce performance costs; for example, the Genesis scanner reduces the on-screen display complexity, while some creatures were designed to have simplistic skeletal physics and no HD textures. A pair of glasses for Jill was originally suggested as the Genesis scanner.|$|E

According to Carter, Morgan and Wong [...] "just outdid themselves on this show, as did director David Nutter, who really works so hard for us. I think they wrote a great script and he did a great job directing it, and we had a great supporting cast". Nutter said: [...] "The real great thing about 'Ice' is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> convey a strong sense of paranoia. It was also a great ensemble piece. We're dealing with the most basic emotions of each character, ranging from their anger to their ignorance and fear. It established the emotional ties these two characters have with each other, which is very important. Scaring {{the hell out of the}} audience was definitely the key to the episode".

500|$|The Workshop had a {{reorganization}} during 1995, {{and dismissed}} about 12 {{percent of its}} staff. During 1998, {{for the first time}} in the series' history, they accepted funds from corporations for Sesame Street and its other programs, a policy criticized by consumer advocate Ralph Nader. [...] The Workshop defended the acceptance of corporate sponsorship, stating that it compensated for a decrease of government subsidies and financial assistance by PBS. Also during 1998, the Workshop invested $25 million in the cable channel Noggin, initiated during 1999 by the Workshop and Viacom's Nickelodeon. During 2000, the profit the CTW earned from the deal, along with its 1998 revenue caused partly by the [...] "Tickle Me Elmo" [...] craze, enabled the CTW to purchase The Jim Henson Company's rights to the Sesame Street Muppets from the German media company EM.TV, which had acquired Henson earlier that year. The transaction, valued at $180 million, also included a small interest Henson had in the Noggin cable channel. Gary Knell stated, [...] "Everyone, most especially the puppeteers, were thrilled <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> bring them home. It protected Sesame Street and allowed our international expansion to continue. Owning these characters has allowed us to maximize their potential. We are now in control of our own destiny".|$|E
500|$|Russo was not {{involved}} in the selection of the sourced songs used throughout the show, with Hawley already knowing the songs he wanted to use and working with music supervisor Maggie Phillips to get the license for them. With the influence of Pink Floyd's music on both Hawley and Russo, Hawley wanted to use their music in the season's finale, as Phillips noted it [...] "never quite fit in the other episodes". He chose the songs [...] "Breathe" [...] and [...] "On the Run", as [...] "they flow into each other on the record. There’s no pause in between those songs. So {{there was no way to}} go with just one song." [...] This posed an issue with the series' budget that became the hardest licensing struggle for the series. Phillips described [...] "an extremely difficult negotiation process, but we were working with some great people that recognized what we were doing was interesting. We ended up getting a price <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> persuade FX was worth it. But, it took months." [...] The songs were confirmed on the day of the final sound mix for the show. In case the songs could not have been secured, Hawley asked Phillips to choose an alternative from the works of The Flaming Lips. Phillips said she was [...] "not a huge fan of Flaming Lips, but I listened to every single song they’ve ever done". They ultimately decided that none of the songs would work for the sequence, so Russo composed original music to replace the Pink Floyd songs if necessary.|$|E
500|$|The New 52 ongoing {{series are}} {{organized}} under seven different [...] "families," [...] grouping similar characters or themes within the books together. By {{the release of}} the October 2013 solicitations, DC was no longer grouping the titles by these families. They instead began releasing one larger solicit, titled [...] "The New 52 Group". However, titles that were not participating in an event for the month, such as [...] "Forever Evil", were still grouped together in the larger solicit by the previous family headings. In September 2014, DC co-publisher Dan DiDio spoke about classifying the titles into the families, saying, [...] "one of the things we did, when we launched the New 52, we broke those classifications up in a way <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> draw attention to all the characters. So we put them in groupings so {{we would be able to}} promote and help them draw attention in groups. It was never made to be a certain amount different stuff. We always want to have different styles of product... with a lot of characters, we're careful. Things like Frankenstein and Grifter and Voodoo and things of that nature, which were really risky characters and risky chances for us to take, and we're very happy to do them. Even though they didn't work, we knew there was value in those characters... We think they brought a lot of value to the launch. They brought a lot of breadth and depth to the line of books, and a diversity to the line. We didn't want to put them out and then forget about them. It was very important to make sure that they were prominent in other series, and that's why we put them in" [...] other series.|$|E

[...] Bennet likened {{the end of the season}} to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. This finale feels like the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We wanted to put a close to [...] story. We knew going into this season what our plan was for both Ward and Hive. Our goal was to make it not just feel like victory—we like to get a victory and also a loss at the same time." [...] On whether the Inhumans storyline would also be ending with the season, Whedon said, [...] "We think of it as never closed. We like <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> open up that world and make Inhumans a permanent part of the universe. Now, we have a quick-fire way of introducing people with powers. It gives us a lot of leeway in our world, and it lets us explode the metaphors of what it is like to be different. We will never close that chapter." [...] On making a six-month time jump at the end of [...] "Ascension", Bell said that despite each character completing their arcs this season, [...] "we still have a lot of plot. Emotionally, their arcs are done. What the jump lets you do is to do a reset ... It allows us to put down a lot of old plot and pick up a lot of new." [...] Whedon added, [...] "We’ve done it each season, so we just wanted to do it a little early ... we would’ve done [...] in episode 1 next year but what we wanted to do was tease" [...] things to come at the end of this season.|$|E
