5|$|Pompey and Crassus proved {{themselves}} to be as incompetent as Caesar had hoped. Clodius terrorized the city with his armed gangs, and agitated Pompey {{to such a degree}} that Pompey was able to secure the passage of a law in 57 BC which recalled Cicero from his exile. This was more of a triumph for the senate <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> Pompey, however, since Pompey was allied with Caesar. Pompey was so inept that the senate decided to override him, and rescind the land laws that Caesar had passed in 59 BC for Pompey's veterans. This forced a renewal of the triumvirate: Pompey and Crassus were promised the Consulship in 55 BC and Caesar's term as governor was extended for five years. Caesar's daughter, and Pompey's wife, Julia, soon died in childbirth, and a year later, Crassus was killed during his invasion of the Parthian Empire. These two events severed the last remaining bond between Pompey and Caesar.|$|E

25|$|Boeing {{initially}} {{ruled out}} producing a re-engined {{version of its}} 737 {{to compete with the}} Airbus A320neo family launch planned for 2015, believing airlines would be looking towards the Boeing Y1 and a 30% fuel saving, instead of paying 10% more for fuel efficiency gains of only a few percent. Industry sources believe that the 737's design makes re-engining considerably more expensive for Boeing <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> the Airbus A320. However, there did prove to be considerable demand. Southwest Airlines, who use the 737 for their entire fleet (680 in service or on order), said they were not prepared to wait 20 years or more for a new 737 model and threatened to convert to Airbus. Boeing eventually bowed to airline pressure and in 2011 approved the 737 MAX project, scheduled for first delivery in 2017.|$|E

[...] While Alberta did receive compensation {{in the form of}} an annual grant, Brownlee, like his three immediate predecessors, felt that it was insufficient. [...] The federal government had been committed since 1920 to the principle of transferring resource control to the province; only the specific terms of the transfer remained to be established. [...] Alberta, though willing to give up the grant, felt that it was owed compensation for land grants and mineral leases that were made by the federal government, but which Alberta would be expected to honour after the resources were transferred.|$|E

2500|$|As [...] "library/thesis" [...] precedents, Rader {{cited the}} Federal Circuit case In re Bayer, which had {{held that a}} {{graduate}} school thesis {{that had not been}} cataloged or placed on library shelves, and that was only known to the three faculty members who served on the thesis committee, did not qualify as a printed publication. Rader also cited the Federal Circuit case In re Cronyn, in which a thesis was placed in a library and indexed by the author's last name, and was determined not to qualify as a printed publication. Rader acknowledged that SRI International had elements in common with In Re Bayer. His analysis likened the uncatalogued nature of the thesis in the library to the posting of the Live Traffic paper on an FTP server which did not allow for searching and did not contain an index. According to Rader, the fact that Porras emailed direct links to those accessing the papers showed that a person skilled in the field {{would not have been able}} to access the Live Traffic Paper. Moreover, Rader argued that the public accessibility was less compelling for SRI International <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>for</b> In re Bayer, as the document in the former case was in pre-publication review, while the thesis in the latter had already been completed.|$|E

We measure entrainment on eight acoustic features extracted from the speech of subjects playing a cooperative computer game and associate the degree of entrainment with a number of manually-labeled social variables acquired using Amazon Mechanical Turk, as well as objective measures of dialogue success. We find that male-female pairs entrain on all features, while male-male pairs entrain only on particular acoustic features (intensity mean, intensity maximum and syllables per second). We further determine that entrainment is more important to the perception of female-male social behavior <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> same-gender pairs, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> more important to the smoothness and flow of male-male dialogue <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> female-female or mixedgender pairs.
