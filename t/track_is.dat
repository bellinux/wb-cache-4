5|$|Both NEC tracks have {{high-level}} platforms, {{which were}} added in 2001 {{for use by}} Acela Express trains (which cannot use low platforms). The southbound NEC <b>track</b> <b>is</b> served by a low platform behind the station, {{which leads to a}} short high-level platform south of State Street. The northbound NEC <b>track</b> <b>is</b> served by a high-level platform behind the station building; the low platform south of State Street is generally only used for deboarding passengers from busy trains. Because of the sharp curve, the high-level platforms are set slightly back from the tracks to avoid scraping the ends of train cars, and thus bridge plates are needed to span the gap between platform and car.|$|E
