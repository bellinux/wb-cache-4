He enrolled in the College of Law at the University of Florida, where his son Robert was also in attendance. The two formed an American handball team during their spare time, and won several tournaments.

After seven years as Brown's top aide, a span over which the Cleveland team won five league championships, Collier took a job as head football coach at Kentucky in 1954.

5|$|In 1872, Thompson {{was elected}} {{president}} of Otterbein University, and remained in that position until 1886. He received a doctorate in divinity from Otterbein the following year. As president, Thompson continued to <b>teach</b> <b>and</b> delivered speeches around the country on school or church business. Thompson took office shortly before the financial Panic of 1873, with the result that his primary concern as president was keeping the college funded. In this he was successful, although the college had to borrow money to stay afloat until the economy recovered. After the initial debt was incurred, Thompson worked to raise donations to pay it off more quickly. He also worked to attract new professors to teach at Otterbein, improving both the quality of education and the school's reputation among scholars. Thompson was involved in organizing the General Board of Education of the United Brethren Church, which served as a coordinating body for the schools affiliated with the church.|$|E

5|$|Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{plans to}} go to his first sales call with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Dwight surprises Ryan by taking him to Dwight's beet farm to both <b>teach</b> <b>and</b> haze. When Ryan, a member of a {{fraternity}} in college, accuses him of trying to haze him into acceptance, Dwight snaps at him, saying the reason Ryan has yet to make a sale is because he thinks he knows everything, and must think otherwise to sell. After Dwight tries to force Ryan to wrestle his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), Ryan gets angry and walks out. Dwight apologizes to Ryan and begins to give Ryan serious sales advice as Ryan takes notes. The two then go on a sales call which ultimately doesn't work out for Ryan. Irritated, Ryan throws eggs at the building housing the company that refused his sale. Dwight and Ryan then go to a bar and return to the office, where it appears they formed a new bond.|$|E

Hoping to <b>teach</b> <b>and</b> pursue a further degree, he applied for a position at the university but was rejected as few locals held academic posts at that time. He therefore entered the civil service, working for the Income Tax Department (1957–1961), Central Provident Fund Board (1961–1965), and the Singapore Telephone Board (1965–1966) where he was an assistant secretary. In 1966, the year following Singapore's independence, he joined the University of Singapore as an assistant lecturer. Conducting doctoral research into African poetry in English, he received his Ph.D. from the university in 1970. He became a full professor in the Department of English Language and Literature, heading the department between 1977 and 1993.

In 1832 Alkan took the solo role in his first Concerto da camera for piano and strings at the Conservatoire. In the same year, aged 19, he was elected to the influential Société Académique des Enfants d'Apollon (Society of the Children of Apollo), whose members included Luigi Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, the conductor François Habeneck, and Liszt, who had been elected in 1824 at the age of twelve. Between 1833 and 1836 Alkan participated at many of the Society's concerts. Alkan twice competed unsuccessfully for the Prix de Rome, in 1832 and again in 1834; the cantatas which he wrote for the competition, Hermann et Ketty and L'Entrée en loge, have remained unpublished and unperformed.|$|E

Both teachers and learners experience {{the complexity of}} the learning <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> task. This grounded theory study sought to 'wonder' about the essence of <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning; to investigate the relationship/s that teachers identified within <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning, and to search for priorities, connections, similarities and differences. Melody, Kath, Nadine, Tori, Kerryn and Kaye were the six participants of the study who shared the beliefs and values they held as early childhood educators engaged in various <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning contexts. They participated in interviews, created <b>and</b> discussed <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning metaphors and joined together {{to take part in a}} focus group discussion. Emerging from the data were two theoretical metaphors that revealed relationships to be at the H. E. A. R. T. and R. O. O. T. of <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning.
