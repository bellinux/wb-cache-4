5|$|Following the {{successful}} bid by Melbourne {{to host the}} 1956 Summer Olympics, problems had beset the organising of the Games to the extent <b>that</b> <b>International</b> Olympic Committee President Avery Brundage threatened to award the Games to another city. In response, the Melbourne Organising Committee approached Kent Hughes in 1951 to be its chairman, believing his public stature, Olympian background and experience in administration would be great assets.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, {{the federal}} Ministry of Defence {{launched}} its new Guulwade Plan (Victory Plan), {{which provides a}} roadmap for long-term development of the military. It was formulated with technical support from UNSOM. The framework stipulates <b>that</b> <b>international</b> partners are slated to provide capacity-building as well as assistance for joint operations to 10,900 Somali national army troops, with these units drawn from various regions in the country.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{small amounts}} of {{rutherfordium}} were produced in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in the former Soviet Union and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California.

5|$|Meanwhile, the United States began {{holding an}} annual {{national}} competition—the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships—first held in 1876 by the New York Athletic Club. The establishment of general sports governing bodies for the United States (the Amateur Athletic Union in 1888) and France (the Union des sociétés françaises de sports athlétiques in 1889) put the sport on a formal footing and meant <b>that</b> <b>international</b> competitions became possible.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be {{successful}} in two out of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared efforts at nation-building by the UN to those of the United States, and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace, as compared with four out of eight US cases at peace. Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a {{decline in the number of}} wars, genocides, and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, <b>that</b> <b>international</b> activism—mostly spearheaded by the UN—has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict in that period. Situations in which the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include the Korean War (1950–53) and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf War (1990–91).|$|E
5|$|Both the 1930s episode and the {{outbreak}} of competitive devaluation that began in 2009 occurred during global economic downturns. An important difference with the 2010s period is <b>that</b> <b>international</b> traders are much better able to hedge their exposures to exchange rate volatility due to more sophisticated financial markets. A second difference is that during the later period devaluations have invariably been effected by nations expanding their money supplies—either by creating money to buy foreign currency, {{in the case of}} direct interventions, or by creating money to inject into their domestic economies, with quantitative easing. If all nations try to devalue at once, the net effect on exchange rates could cancel out leaving them largely unchanged, but the expansionary effect of the interventions would remain. So while there has been no collaborative intent, some economists such as Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen and Goldman Sachs's Dominic Wilson have suggested the net effect will be similar to semi-coordinated monetary expansion which will help the global economy.|$|E

On April9, the Congress of the Federated States of Micronesia held a special two-day session at the request of President Manny Mori, which included determination of typhoon relief funds. They allocated $1.5million toward relief for Chuuk and Yap States on April11. The president also issued a price freeze to pre-storm levels to prevent price gouging.|$|E
5|$|Criminal mastermind the Hood (voiced by Ray Barrett) is telepathically {{linked to}} his half-brother, Kyrano (David Graham), the manservant on Tracy Island. Abusing this {{connection}} and inflicting severe psychological trauma on his sibling, he discovers <b>that</b> <b>International</b> Rescue – the Tracy family's newly formed life-saving organisation – {{is ready to}} start operations. Determined to steal the secrets of IR's Thunderbird machines, the Hood plots to have the Tracys called to a disaster situation of his own design. Travelling from his temple hideout in the Malaysian jungle to London International Airport, he plants a bomb next to the landing gear hydraulics of Air Terrainean's new Fireflash – an atomic-powered, hypersonic airliner departing for her maiden flight to Tokyo. One of the passengers is Kyrano's daughter, Tin-Tin. In an anonymous videophone call to London Tower, the Hood warns Commander Norman of Air Traffic Control that the motion-sensitive device will detonate from the impact of landing.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{the third}} major factor behind the {{resolution}} of the financial crisis was the decision by the government of Iceland to apply for membership in the EU in July 2009. While views on the feasibility of EU membership are quite mixed in Iceland, this action has served to enhance the credibility of the country on international financial markets. One sign {{of the success of the}} above efforts is the fact that the Icelandic government was successfully able to raise $1 billion with a bond issue on 9 June 2011. This development indicates <b>that</b> <b>international</b> investors have given the government and the new banking system, with two of the three biggest banks now in foreign hands, a clean bill of health. The first two major measures were implemented by the government of Geir H. Haarde but also carried out by the government of Johanna Sigurdardottir, which then took the step to apply for EU membership.|$|E

5|$|For {{the most}} part, Germans {{accepted}} the Nuremberg Laws, partly because Nazi propaganda had successfully swayed public opinion towards the general belief that Jews were a separate race, {{but also because}} to oppose the regime meant leaving oneself open to harassment or arrest by the Gestapo. Citizens were relieved that the antisemitic violence ceased after the laws were passed. Non-Jews gradually stopped socialising with Jews or shopping in Jewish-owned stores. Wholesalers who continued to serve Jewish merchants were marched through the streets with placards around their necks proclaiming them as traitors. The Communist party and some elements of the Catholic Church were critical of the laws. Concerned <b>that</b> <b>international</b> opinion would be adversely swayed by the new laws, the Interior Ministry did not actively enforce them until after the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin that August.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 the IOC began {{enacting}} {{drug testing}} protocols. They started by randomly testing athletes at the 1968 Winter Olympics. The first Winter Games athlete to test positive for a banned substance was Alois Schloder, a West German hockey player, but {{his team was}} still allowed to compete. During the 1970s testing outside of competition was escalated because it was found to deter athletes from using performance-enhancing drugs. The problem with testing during this time {{was a lack of}} standardisation of the test procedures, which undermined the credibility of the tests. It was not until the late 1980s <b>that</b> <b>international</b> sporting federations began to coordinate efforts to standardise the drug-testing protocols. The IOC took the lead in the fight against steroids when it established the independent World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in November 1999.|$|E

Alan, Tin-Tin, Lady Penelope and Parker will represent International Rescue as special guests. Brains, meanwhile, is forced to remain on Tracy Island when Jeff decides <b>that</b> <b>International</b> Rescue requires a Thunderbird 6.

5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, many {{claims of}} the {{discovery}} of nobelium were made from laboratories in Sweden, the Soviet Union, and the United States.

When Burger King franchisee in Israel, Rikamor, Ltd., opened a store in the West Bank settlement of Ma'aleh Adumim in August of that year, Islamic groups, including the Arab League and American Muslims for Jerusalem, argued <b>that</b> <b>international</b> Burger King parent Burger King Corporation's licensing of the store helped legitimize the illegal settlement. Beyond the called-for Islamic boycott of the company, the Arab League also threatened the revocation of the business licenses of Burger King's primary Middle Eastern franchise in the 22 countries {{that are part of}} the League's membership.|$|E
5|$|Sudirman and {{his troops}} {{continued}} {{to make their way}} through the jungles and forests, eventually arriving at Sobo, near Mount Lawu, on 18February. During the journey, Sudirman used a radio set to convey orders to local TNI troops if he believed that the region was secure. Feeling weaker because of the physical hardships he had faced, including travelling through the forests and a lack of food, and believing the area to be safe, Sudirman decided that Sobo would serve as his guerrilla headquarters. The local commander, Lieutenant Colonel Wiliater Hutagalung, served as his go-between with the other TNI leaders. Aware <b>that</b> <b>international</b> opinion, which was beginning to condemn Dutch actions in Indonesia, could bring Indonesia greater recognition, Sudirman and Hutagalung discussed possible terms of action, before agreeing on a large-scale assault. Meanwhile, the Dutch began to spread propaganda claiming that they had captured Sudirman; this claim was intended to break the morale of the guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN {{notes that}} {{very little is}} known about the actual status of the great white shark, but as it appears {{uncommon}} compared to other widely distributed species, it is considered vulnerable. It is included in Appendix II of CITES, meaning <b>that</b> <b>international</b> trade in the species requires a permit. As of March 2010, it has also been included in Annex I of the CMS Migratory Sharks MoU, which strives for increased international understanding and coordination for the protection of certain migratory sharks. A February 2010 study by Barbara Block of Stanford University estimated the world population of great white sharks to be lower than 3,500 individuals, making the species more vulnerable to extinction than the tiger, whose population is in the same range. According to another study from 2014 by George H. Burgess, Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida, there are about 2000 great white sharks near the California coast, which is 10 times higher than the previous estimate of 219 by Barbara Block.|$|E
