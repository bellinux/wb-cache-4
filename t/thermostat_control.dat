50|$|Most {{commercial}} griddles have {{a single}} <b>thermostat</b> <b>control</b> for every 12 in of unit width, though some may have only one thermostat for every 24 in. This construction technique reduces unit cost by {{limiting the number of}} expensive control elements, but at the expense of performance and zone control. The <b>thermostat</b> <b>control</b> will not react quickly (if at all) to a surface load that is not relatively close to the probe, whether embedded or bottom mounted, resulting in less control and wider temperature variations on the cooking surface. Many griddle-cooked food portions are 5 in or less in diameter, meaning the distance from probe to the center of a load can average up to 8 in - a very long distance for heat transfer in steel.|$|E

5000|$|Thermostats {{are used}} to {{regulate}} the griddle surface around a temperature set point established by the operator. Ranges of operation can {{vary depending on the}} controls used and the construction of the griddle, but [...] is most common.Other than solid state controls, which are very sensitive across their entire range of control, snap-action and modulating (aka - throttling) thermostats have peak sensitivity across the middle two-thirds of their operating range. This can limit their overall performance {{at the low end of}} their temperature spectrum (at or below [...] ). This is due to the nature of the temperature control mechanism, which consists of a fluid-filled bulb (typically an oil) connected to the <b>thermostat</b> <b>control</b> via a long narrow capillary tube. The fluid in the bulb expands and contracts with temperature, activating a control response from the thermostat. There is a time lag between sensing the temperature change from the surface of the griddle plate to the response of the fluid within the bulb, to the <b>thermostat</b> <b>control</b> and turning the heat source on or off, up or down. This lag is referred to as hysteresis, and is a primary aspect of recovery time - an important griddle performance metric.|$|E
50|$|The first {{electric}} stoves used {{heating elements}} made of high-resistance metal to produce heat. The stovetop (range) surface {{had one or}} more circular heating elements, insulated with compressed magnesia and sheathed in a spiral metal tube. Heating elements for the oven are of similar construction but an elongated loop to distribute heat. Elements were made as plug-in consumer-replaceable parts and could also be easily removed for cleaning. Temperature of cooking elements was regulated by adjusting a bimetal <b>thermostat</b> <b>control</b> switch, which switched power on and off to control the average heating effect of the elements.|$|E

[...] In the 1920s and 1930s Crosthwait invented a vacuum pump, a boiler, and a <b>thermostat</b> <b>control,</b> all for more effective heating systems for larger buildings.

50|$|Access is {{typically}} defined {{within the limits}} of what a person sitting in a wheelchair is able to reach with arm movement only, with minimal shifting of the legs and torso.

50|$|You {{can also}} convert a top opening chest freezer into a beer {{dispenser}} {{with the use}} of a <b>thermostat</b> <b>control</b> unit. This setup is known as a keezer. The advantage of a keezer is that you are assured it will get cold enough to dispense beer at the proper temperature range (32-38 degrees Fahrenheit) and it usually has more interior floor space than a refrigerator, allowing it to store and dispense more kegs. The disadvantage is that it requires the thermostat to be overridden to ensure you don't freeze your kegs and you have to lift the heavy kegs up and over the freezer wall. You can accomplish this conversion with a tower kegerator conversion kit or build an extension on top of the freezer to mount the door and taps onto.|$|E
5000|$|The {{modulating}} thermostat, {{also referred}} to as the throttling thermostat, is the most basic <b>thermostat</b> <b>control</b> offered in the commercial griddle market and is typically found in lower priced griddles where some control is necessary but performance is not critical. It offers the advantage of being a mechanical system that doesn’t require electric power, which simplifies design and reduces overall unit cost. In this particular style of control the fluid in the bulb expands and contracts with temperature and slowly actuates an internal diaphragm which controls gas flow to the burner. One drawback to this control is long response time, which causes the overall control to overshoot and undershoot the temperature target by as much as 40°F (22°C). For example, at a set point of , the griddle surface temperature over the probe can range from [...]|$|E
