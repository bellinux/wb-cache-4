5|$|Moore {{wrote to}} Spargo on September 18, stating that his {{commission}} had approved {{the head of}} Allen but was dissatisfied with the lettering. Spargo had mentioned that President Coolidge liked the Bennington Monument, and Moore stated that the Fine Arts Commission was anxious <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>right</b> a coin for the president's state of birth; Fry, he wrote, had the talent to design a handsome coin, but had not done so. The next day, Spargo replied, hopeful that they would soon resolve the dispute. He stated that the Sesquicentennial Commission felt that designs other than the monument would not do; for example, {{the use of a}} Green Mountain Boy would both require stretching history and risk charges of imitating the Minuteman seen on the Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollar, issued earlier in 1925. He was also unwilling to have a two-headed coin, as such a design combined with the depiction of Allen would be. Spargo suggested that Moore put his objections in writing and be as clear as possible to induce Fry to continue with the project, because the sculptor wanted to withdraw from it. Despite conciliatory efforts, Fry refused to continue, and after the failure of brief negotiations with Theodore Spicer-Simson, the Vermont commission engaged Charles Keck.|$|E

500|$|The {{beginning}} of the episode shows Mr. Burns' casino being demolished with implosion. In the DVD commentary for the episode, show runner Mike Scully stated that there was [...] "a lot of talk" [...] and news reports about implosions at the time. Only directly after the implosion do the on-lookers realize the amount of dust that is unleashed. This {{is based on an}} observation by the writers, who noted that, when an implosion takes place, [...] "everybody wants to be right next to them", not realizing that dust and asbestos will [...] "fly in the air". In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, director Affleck stated that the scene was very complicated to animate, and took about [...] "four or five takes" [...] <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>right.</b> Scully thought that the implosion looked [...] "fantastic".|$|E

The image of the beating heart in the furnace was created by overlapping a shot of a fake beating heart and a shot of actual fire. The two were then merged in post-production by animator John Wash, because the fire would have melted the actual heart model. The beating of the hearts of Naciamento's victims was created via a pump that was operated off-screen. The actual milagro prop was crafted several times because, according to Manners, the face was particularly difficult <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>right.</b> In fact, the second time the medallion appears in the episode, {{it is a different}} prop.|$|E

500|$|... "Margaritaville" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker. It first aired on March 25, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone said they had long planned to do an episode about the global recession, and they argued over whether to start the season with an episode about the economy, or [...] "The Ring," [...] an episode mocking the Jonas Brothers, a boy band which had recently grown in popularity. Stone argued the season premiere should focus on the economy because it was the biggest news item at the time, but Parker felt they needed more time to craft the script, and that the Jonas Brothers would be a funny season opener. Stone ultimately agreed, and later admitted it was the right decision. During an interview {{a few weeks before the}} episode aired, Stone said, [...] "That's one of those big things we want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>right.</b> We'll be talking about what kind of social commentary we want to make and do it right." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{become the}} {{character}} of Emperor Akbar, Prithviraj Kapoor {{was reported to have}} [...] "relied completely on the script and director". Prior to make-up, Kapoor would declare, [...] "Prithviraj Kapoor ab jaa rahaa hai" [...] ("Prithviraj Kapoor is now going"); after make-up, he would announce, [...] "Akbar ab aa rahaa hai" [...] ("Akbar is now coming"). Kapoor faced difficulty with his heavy costumes, and suffered blisters on his feet after walking barefoot in the desert for a sequence. Lance Dane, a photographer who was on set during the filming, recalled that Kapoor struggled to remember his lines in some scenes; he mentioned one scene in particular that Kapoor required 19 takes <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>right.</b> At the time of filming, Kapoor who was on a diet, was told by Asif to regain the lost weight for his portrayal of Akbar. Zakir Hussain, who later became a tabla maestro, had initially been considered for the part of the young Prince Salim, but it became the debut role of Jalal Agha, who later performed on the song [...] "Mehbooba Mehbooba" [...] from Sholay (1975).|$|E

FuseFX was {{given the opportunity to}} design the Bus. The design included many features from the start, such as the ability to do vertical take-offs and landing".

A very complex rig controls every aspect of the plane from the landing gear, engine transformation, doors opening, lighting and even the wings have flex controls for the animators to sell the weight of this massive aircraft. When the engines are in vertical flight mode they have several degrees of rotation which gives the jet a lot of maneuvering ability." ...|$|E

500|$|Because the series' {{production}} doesn't build sets till [...] "a {{couple of}} days before the shoot or even the day before the shoot or, sometimes even the morning of the shoot" [...] the stunt team was not able to coordinate with the art department and set decorators {{in the construction of the}} set, so the fight sequence had to be slightly reconfigured on the day of the shoot to fit the set. A steam effect in the sequence proved difficult due to the special effects operator having to time it with Bennet's shooting, working around a delay in the air canister system of several seconds. Tancharoen used a handheld camera, with the operator having to [...] "run all over the place with this really heavy camera on his shoulder", but wanted to move away from the Jason Bourne, shaky-cam style of filming, saying that because of his background in choreography, [...] "It’s drilled in my head that the camera has to complement the movement of the action." [...] The shot took four takes <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>right,</b> with Bennet breaking her arm during the filming of the final take, and having to carry out the rest of her fight scenes for the season with the injury.|$|E
500|$|O'Reilly {{explained}} that Naomi's style was harder <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>right</b> and {{she worked with}} the producers, costume and make-up departments {{to find the right}} look. The actress said, [...] "she has {{to have a sense of}} sass and sexuality about her, but she's not cheap and she has worked very hard to shake off her trashy past. What we've come up with is amazing. Some days I put my costume on for a scene and think, 'Oh Naomi, you're outrageous! I could never wear this! Oh well. Go get 'em girl!'" [...] O'Reilly thought some of Naomi's outfits complimented her [...] "quite sexual" [...] nature, especially the six-inch heels and small tops. O'Reilly admitted that she did not have too much in common with Naomi, but they could both be [...] "goofy and funny". She thought Naomi was definitely not as level-headed as she was in real life. She also said that she enjoyed playing a character who was different from herself. Executive producer Jason Herbison told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that he thought Naomi's type of character – a [...] "classic, troublemaking vixen, who underneath it all is just deeply insecure" [...] – had been missing from Neighbours for a few years.|$|E
500|$|Running {{eight minutes}} {{longer than any}} in the series, the episode was also the most {{technical}} and complex. Whedon, who has stated {{this is one of}} his favorite Buffy episodes, used a widescreen letterbox format for filming (the only episode in the series to get this treatment), different lighting to bring out the sets more vibrantly, and long takes for shooting—including a complicated shot with a full conversation, a song, and two choreographed dances that took 21 attempts <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>right.</b> These were designed to give viewers all the clues they needed to establish all the nuances of the relationships between characters. Davies commented that the intricacies of filming this episode were [...] "infinitely more complicated than a regular Buffy" [...] episode, and Whedon stated in the DVD commentary that he was ambitious to prove what television is capable of, saying [...] "it just depends how much you care". UPN, the television network that aired Buffys last two seasons, promoted the episode by displaying Gellar's face on billboards with music notes over her eyes, and held a special premiere event. Network president Dean Valentine remarked he thought it was [...] "one of the best episodes of television I ever saw in my life".|$|E

500|$|Square Enix {{wanted to}} be one of the first {{companies}} to make games for the WiiWare service to attract more attention to their game as it was very different from other Final Fantasy games. One of the developers of , Kenichiro Yuji, was chosen as the games director. Several gameplay ideas were considered for the project, including making it an action role-playing game or a sandbox video game, but the developers were not fans of the sandbox genre and settled on making an action role-playing game. The game originated from the concept that the player should control a king, rather than the hero, what they called an [...] "inverted game" [...] from the usual format. The battle system went through four revisions, much of which was discarded before the final design was agreed upon. At first it was thought that players would spend most of their time observing the action, but eventually features were added to encourage player engagement through various activities. Battle reports thus became one of the toughest challenges for the team, and went through several iterations <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>right.</b> The development team also found it difficult to write dialogue that would keep the game exciting without the player actually participating in or even witnessing the battles.|$|E

Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing that was quite difficult for me <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>right</b> was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough." [...] Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show [...] "feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it [...] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they can do something about it. [...] We're not trying to cause a national panic. This is a responsible effort to try to get over an important story." ...|$|E
500|$|Positive reviews {{praised the}} film's {{take on a}} classic Disney story, its comedy and musical numbers {{as well as the}} {{performance}} of its lead actress, Amy Adams. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as a [...] "heart-winning musical comedy that skips lightly and sprightly from the lily pads of hope to the manhole covers of actuality" [...] and one that [...] "has a Disney willingness to allow fantasy into life". Film critics of Variety and LA Weekly remarked on the film's ability to cater for all ages. LA Weekly described the film as [...] "the sort of buoyant, all-ages entertainment that Hollywood has been laboring to revive in recent years (most recently with Hairspray) but hasn't managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>right</b> until now" [...] while Todd McCarthy of Variety commented, [...] "More than Disney's strictly animated product, Enchanted, in the manner of the vast majority of Hollywood films made until the '60s, is a film aimed at the entire population – niches be damned. It simply aims to please, without pandering, without vulgarity, without sops to pop-culture fads, and to pull this off today is no small feat." [...] Enchanted was the Broadcast Film Critics Association's choice for Best Family Film of 2007 while Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer named it the 4th best film of 2007.|$|E

500|$|Slay Tracks found {{unexpected}} attention {{after the}} Leeds, England-based band The Wedding Present covered [...] "Box Elder" [...] {{on their own}} 1990 EP, Brassneck. The Wedding Present's bassist, Keith Gregory, had been introduced to Slay Tracks by future Pavement bassist Mark Ibold while visiting New York City. The Wedding Present cover {{is different from the}} original in that the line [...] "that I had to {{get the fuck out of}} this town" [...] was changed to [...] "that I had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>right</b> out of this town". The [...] "Box Elder" [...] cover received radio airplay from influential English disc jockey John Peel, which generated publicity for both The Wedding Present and Pavement. Neither member of Pavement was aware of the cover until Kannberg was informed of it. Kannberg remembered [...] "I was kind of mad. I had no idea that people could do that, so I was all offended." [...] However, his opinion of the cover and its significance later changed: [...] "It was so cool that some band from the UK wanted to cover this obscure, horribly recorded song. At the time I probably never appreciated the full extent of how them covering the song helped Pavement, especially in the UK, but it really did, and I'll always be grateful to them for that." ...|$|E
500|$|The ninth track [...] "The Hook Up" [...] has a reggae {{feel and}} {{features}} Spears {{singing in a}} Jamaican Patois accent. The ballad [...] "Shadow" [...] talks about how reminders of a lover can still linger after he’s gone. [...] "Brave New Girl" [...] lyrics talk about a young woman finding her passion and losing inhibitions. Backed by choppy, electro-funk beats, she sings in a bouncy near-rap, [...] "She's gonna pack her bags, she's going to find her way, she's going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>right</b> out of this/ She don't want New York, she don't want L.A., she's {{going to find that}} special kiss." [...] The song incorporates elements of the music of No Doubt, Blondie and Madonna. [...] "Everytime" [...] begins with a piano introduction accompanying Spears's breathy vocals, which build from soft to strong throughout the song. [...] "Everytime" [...] lyrics are a plea for forgiveness for inadvertently hurting a former lover. In the song, the singer explains she feels unable to continue in lines such as [...] "Everytime I try to fly I fall / Without my wings I feel so small". During an interview with MTV, Spears said about the song, [...] "It's about heartbreak, it's about your first love, your first true love. That's something all people can relate to, because you all have that first love that you think you're going to be with the rest of your life." [...] When asked if [...] "Everytime" [...] was about Timberlake, she responded [...] "I'll let the song speak for itself." [...] The Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix of [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] removes the original melody of the song and adds a clattering backbeat and Punjabi shouts. In [...] "The Answer", Spears sings that her lover is the answer to all her needs: [...] "Who can hold me tight, keep me warm through the night? / Who can wipe my tears when it's wrong, make it right? / Who can give me love till I'm satisfied? / Who's the one I need in my life?".
