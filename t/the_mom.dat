25|$|As {{originally}} conceived, ISRO was {{to launch}} MOM on its Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), {{but as the}} GSLV failed twice in 2010 and ISRO was continuing to sort out issues with its cryogenic engine, it was not advisable {{to wait for the}} new batch of rockets as that would have delayed <b>the</b> <b>MOM</b> project for at least three years. ISRO opted to switch to the less-powerful Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). Since the PSLV was not powerful enough to place MOM on a direct-to-Mars trajectory, the spacecraft was launched into a highly elliptical Earth orbit and used its own thrusters over multiple perigee burns (to take advantage of the Oberth effect) to place itself on a trans-Mars trajectory.|$|E

In reply, the Chittagong trio Nurul Abedin (85), Akram Khan 50, & Minhajul Abedin 37 kept Bangladesh in the hunt; but it was Moni's quickfire 17* and his explosive hitting in the final over, that took Bangladesh to the target, with just 2 balls to spare. With the ball, Enamul Haque took 2/26 from 12 overs; {{and he was the}} obvious choice for <b>the</b> <b>MOM</b> award. In contrast, his biggest disappointment came in Feb. 1994, in the do-or-die game against the hosts Kenya at Nairobi.

In reply, Bangladesh started their chase well with the opening pair of Jahangir Alam and Aminul Islam Bulbul putting on a 139 run partnership. After that, Minhajul Abedin contributed 68, but Moni fell for a duck, at a crucial stage of the match, and eventually Kenya won by 13 runs.|$|E

500|$|The jury began {{deliberations}} on November 17, 2010. Scheduled {{proceedings of}} the case met delays because of increased security at the courthouse. After two days of deliberations, all but one juror had voted to convict Guandique. On the third day, the jury asked Judge Gerald Fisher to clarify the definition of assault. Fisher responded that any physical injury could legally be considered an assault, regardless of how small. On November 22, 2010, the jury found Guandique guilty of both remaining counts of first-degree murder. After the trial, a juror said the testimony of Morales was decisive in reaching the verdict. The conviction was called a [...] "miracle" [...] for having been reached with only circumstantial evidence.

500|$|The episode also {{features}} a reappearance by Celeste Kane (Lisa Thornhill), a recurring character during the first season. The second season DVD includes an alternate ending to this episode, which was released around the airing of the episode as a promotional tool. The alternate ending starts {{the same way as}} the regular ending, with Veronica discovering that Meg is pregnant. But instead of the episode ending there, Meg's mom comes into the room while Veronica hides in the bathroom. When <b>the</b> <b>mom</b> leaves, Meg is dead with a pillow over her face, indicating smothering. However, Veronica takes the pillow off before a nurse comes in. Thomas commented that the alternate ending was never going to be the actual conclusion to the episode. He said: [...] "We never seriously considered having that be the ending. There were various other endings that we did have, but they were so subtly different, it was like, 'When does Veronica enter the room?'" [...] The idea to promote the alternate ending was a joint venture from the UPN promotions department and executive producer Joel Silver. After Thomas learned that others wanted an alternate ending, he decided to make it very different from the episode's actual conclusion. [...] "But once we could have a [...] alternate ending, we thought, 'Let's make it rock.' The beauty of having that alternate ending is that we don't have to play it out in the next episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Controversy {{was first}} {{reported}} by Australian music site Undercover.com.au on December 5, 2008, {{after the release}} of the album. Leonie Barsenbach, a housewife from Sydney, said, [...] "I was astonished and totally taken aback when I heard my 5 and 7 year old kids walking around the house singing 'F-U-C-K'... When I asked them what it was, they told me it was Britney Spears. I was horrified. I got them the Circus album but there was no warning on it... It is extremely offensive. I feel deceived." [...] Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps defended Spears, arguing that parents should have been aware of the singer's musical themes. After the song was announced as the third single from the album, American radio stations were unsure about playing the track due to its double entendre in the chorus. Program directors of Z100 and KIIS-FM compared the issues to be faced by their radio stations to the release of the 2005 The Black Eyed Peas single, [...] "Don't Phunk with My Heart", saying that [...] "listeners thought it was the other word, and so we had to change it to 'mess'". Program director Patti Marshall of Q102 said [...] "It's ok to put in on an album, have fun with it, but we're publicly owned, you know? [...] It's not about us. It's about <b>the</b> <b>mom</b> in the minivan with her 8-year-old."

[...] These krewes began holding special private parties featuring The Radiators, usually masquerade balls like <b>the</b> <b>M.O.M.s</b> Ball. [...] Also like <b>the</b> <b>M.O.M.'s</b> Ball, these parties are usually given both collective and individual names.
