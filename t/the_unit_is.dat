5|$|Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) {{is used by}} the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{and other}} {{agencies}} to express the activity of individual tropical cyclones that are above tropical storm strength and entire tropical cyclone seasons. It is calculated by taking the squares of the estimated maximum sustained velocity of every active tropical storm (wind speed 35 knots or higher) at six-hour intervals. The numbers are usually divided by 10,000 to make them more manageable. The unit of ACE is 104 kn2, and for use as an index <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>is</b> assumed. As well as being squared for ACE, wind speed can also be cubed, which {{is referred to as the}} Power Dissipation Index (PDI).|$|E

5|$|Before public release, {{work units}} go through several quality {{assurance}} steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home. Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, {{except in the}} rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>is</b> automatically pulled from distribution. The Folding@home support forum {{can be used to}} differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.|$|E

5|$|A new guitar {{controller}} {{was developed}} for Guitar Hero 5, sold with bundles with the game though the option for standalone versions {{has not yet been}} determined. Like other Guitar Hero controllers, the guitar-shaped unit features five colored fret buttons on the neck of the guitar, a strum bar to mimic the act of strumming, a whammy bar to alter the pitch of a note, and additional buttons specific to the game console for maneuvering through the game's menus. <b>The</b> <b>unit</b> <b>is</b> mostly a redesign of the World Tour model with a new red finish and includes the touchpad that is farther up the neck of the controller, allowing the player to play notes via tapping or to slide along its surface for specially marked sections on the note track. The Guitar Hero 5 unit features a more accurate and responsive touchpad due to it being tracked digitally and with added tactile responses, a more accurate strum bar, and a controller finish that makes it easier to handle with sweaty hands. The game remains compatible with previous Guitar Hero game controllers as well as those from Rock Band and selected other rhythm games.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Plan Beersheba reorganisation, {{the unit}} {{has become one of}} three Armoured Cavalry Regiments (ACRs) {{assigned}} to the Army's multirole combat brigades in Brisbane, Darwin and Townsville. As an ACR, <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>is</b> equipped with M1A1 tanks, ASLAV light armoured vehicles, and M113 armoured personnel carriers. Under the reforms announced in 2011 and confirmed in the 2013 Defence White Paper, the three Regular Army brigades will be restructured between 2014 and 2017 into three Combat Brigades with a similar structure and capabilities, each consisting of: a Brigade Headquarters, an Armoured Cavalry Regiment, two Standard Infantry Battalions, an Artillery Regiment, a Combat Engineer Regiment, a Combat Service Support Battalion and a Combat Signals Regiment. In 2015 it was reported that the Darwin-based elements of the 1st Armoured Regiment may be transferred to South Australia. In late 2015 one of the 1st Armoured Regiment's two tank squadrons was transferred to the Townsville-based 2nd Cavalry Regiment, with 14 of the tanks relocating.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF {{has been}} {{pleased with the}} King Air's {{performance}} in the light transport role, though the aircraft cannot be deployed into combat areas. No. 38 Squadron often operates with the Army's Townsville-based 3rd Brigade, {{as well as the}} 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment, which conducts operational patrols across Far North Queensland during peacetime. <b>The</b> <b>unit</b> <b>is</b> also frequently tasked with transporting senior politicians and other VIPs. The King Airs often operate in Papua New Guinea, as well as other parts of the Asia-Pacific region. The Australian Government ordered 10 Alenia C-27J Spartan battlefield transports in May 2012, and these aircraft will be operated by No. 35 Squadron from 2015. No. 38 Squadron marked its 70th anniversary in 2013, and has the longest period of continual operation of any of the RAAF's flying squadrons.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>units</b> <b>were</b> also {{fitted with}} {{batteries}} {{to allow them}} to operate over the short-distance of non-electrified line at the quayside. The batteries allowed <b>the</b> <b>units</b> to <b>be</b> used at low-speed for 20–30 minutes, and could <b>be</b> recharged when <b>the</b> <b>unit</b> <b>was</b> taking power from 750V DC third-rail.|$|R

5|$|The {{basic unit}} of {{measurement}} used during construction was the tala, defined as {{the length of a}} human face from the forehead's hairline to the tip of the chin or the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance. <b>The</b> <b>unit</b> <b>is</b> thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of the fractal and self-similar geometry in Borobudur's design. This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples. Archeologists have conjectured that the 4:6:9 ratio and the tala have calendrical, astronomical and cosmological significance, {{as is the case with}} the temple of Angkor Wat in Cambodia.|$|E
25|$|This type {{of vehicle}} {{tracking}} is normally used in the fleet or driver management sector. <b>The</b> <b>unit</b> <b>is</b> configured to automatically transmit its location at a set time interval, e.g. every 5 minutes. <b>The</b> <b>unit</b> <b>is</b> activated when the ignition is switched on/off.|$|E
