25|$|Many consequentialist {{theories}} {{may seem}} {{primarily concerned with}} human beings and their relationships with other human beings. However, some philosophers argue <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> limit our ethical consideration {{to the interests of}} human beings alone. Jeremy Bentham, who is regarded as the founder of utilitarianism, argues that animals can experience pleasure and pain, thus demanding that 'non-human animals' should be a serious object of moral concern. More recently, Peter Singer has argued that it is unreasonable that we do not give equal consideration to the interests of animals as to those of human beings when we choose the way we are to treat them. Such equal consideration does not necessarily imply identical treatment of humans and non-humans, any more than it necessarily implies identical treatment of all humans.|$|E

These stories are told with a curiously exaggerated delight at the deception...", giving as example how Professor Drummond in his book Tropical Africa thought a mantid was a wisp of hay. He picks up on the casually mentioned fact that Drummond's African companion was not deceived, writing <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> judge camouflage [...] "from the human standpoint".|$|E

Indeed, both [...] and her are so good to us <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be deserving of having such treasures about us, {{if we did not}} feel their kindness in the highest degree". Finch resigned from her role in November 1792 and retired on 5 January 1793, though she continued to correspond with {{members of the royal family}} and receive gifts from them, particularly the Prince of Wales, the future George IV. She received £600 in yearly payment, supplemented by income from the South Sea Company, until her death on 11 July 1813 at St James's Palace.|$|E

He gave evidence about the post-war planning done prior to the invasion of Iraq, stating that he had urged Prime Minister Tony Blair and his aide, Alastair Campbell, to delay the invasion two days prior {{to the beginning of}} the conflict. Cross told Sir John Chilcot, the inquiry chairman, that preparations for Iraq after the removal of Saddam Hussein were [...] "woefully thin".

500|$|Saruman [...] "was great once, of a noble kind <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> dare {{raise our}} hands against" [...] but decays {{as the book}} goes on. Patricia Meyer Spacks calls him [...] "one of the main case {{histories}} [...] of the gradual destructive effect of willing submission to evil wills". Paul Kocher identifies Saruman's use of a palantír, a seeing-stone, as the immediate cause of his downfall, but also suggests that through his study of [...] "the arts of the enemy", Saruman was drawn into imitation of Sauron. According to Jonathan Evans and Spacks, Saruman succumbs to the lust for power, while Shippey identifies Saruman's devotion to goals of knowledge, organization and control as his weakness. Tolkien writes that the Istari's chief temptation (and that to which Saruman fell) is impatience, leading to a desire to force others to do good, {{and then to a}} simple desire for power.|$|E
500|$|The Fiery Trial was {{generally}} well received by critics, who praised its insights and lucidity. David S. Reynolds, reviewing for The New York Times, described {{the book as}} a [...] "political biography of Lincoln", and concluded that [...] "More cogently than any previous historian, Foner examines the political events that shaped Lincoln and ultimately brought out his true greatness." [...] James M. McPherson, a previous winner of the Pulitzer Prize for History, stated of the book that [...] "No one else has written about [...] trajectory of change with such balance, fairness, depth of analysis, and lucid precision of language." [...] Library Journal called it [...] "an essential work for all Americans": [...] "In the vast library on Lincoln, Foner's book stands out as the most sensible and sensitive reading of Lincoln's lifetime involvement with slavery and the most insightful assessment of Lincoln's—and indeed America's—imperative to move toward freedom lest it be lost." [...] David M. Shribman, writing in The Boston Globe, called Foner [...] "perhaps the preeminent historian of the Civil War era" [...] and the book [...] "a masterwork that examines Lincoln's passage to Gettysburg and beyond". In the San Francisco Chronicle, David W. Blight called The Fiery Trial [...] "a distinctive and valuable book, showing persuasively <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> understand Lincoln from the myth-glazed outcome reading backward, but from the beginning, through one transformative event after another, looking forward." ...|$|E

2500|$|The science {{revolution}} {{attributed to}} Thales began gaining political force, and this play offered {{a warning to}} the new thinkers.

Through the play, according to Kitto, Sophocles declares [...] "that it is wrong, in the face of the incomprehensible and unmoral, to deny the moral laws and accept chaos. What is right is to recognize facts and not delude ourselves. The universe is a unity; if, sometimes, we can see neither rhyme nor reason in it we should not suppose it is random.

2500|$|On 6 September 1941, Germany's Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl visited Helsinki. His {{main goal}} was to persuade Mannerheim to {{continue}} the offensive.

After the war, Ryti stated: [...] "On August 24, 1941 I visited the headquarters of Marshal Mannerheim. The Germans aimed us at crossing the old border and continuing the offensive to Leningrad. I said that the capture of Leningrad was not our goal and <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> take part in it. Mannerheim and Minister of Defense Walden agreed with me and refused the offers of the Germans. The result was a paradoxical situation: the Germans could not approach Leningrad from the north..."

2500|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, Negoiţescu {{published}} several articles which examined the political developments in post-1989 Romania, {{focusing on the}} return to popularity of some far right themes. Marta Petreu paraphrased their content as [...] "vocal appeals [...] <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> try to build a European Romania on the political ideas of Noica, Eliade, Cioran, Nae Ionescu, Eminescu and Vulcănescu". In tandem, Negoiţescu was also rejecting the political stances of post-communist leftist forces, in particular the ruling National Salvation Front (FSN). In a letter cited by Manea, Negoiţescu strongly rejected the claims publicized by FSN member and former Communist Party activist Silviu Brucan, who had publicly stated that, for lack of [...] "democratic traditions", Romania could expect to undergo two decades of transition from communist institutions to a fully fledged liberal democracy. He found Brucan's assertion [...] "insulting" [...] for Romania's population as a whole, while noting that, between 1881 and 1938, the Kingdom of Romania had had democratic institutions, and comparing the overall context of the 1990s with Spain's three-year-long transition. At around the same time, Negoiţescu also reacted against the tendency of some Romanians to reassess their national literature purely {{on the basis of}} its political status under communism, primarily noting that various works once considered valuable for their subtext had come to lose their importance, and called for a reevaluation.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the history}} of the origin of the use of the concept and meaning of 'good' are diverse, the notable discussions of Plato and Aristotle on this subject have been of {{significant}} historical effect. The first references that are seen in Plato's The Republic to the Form of the Good are within the conversation between Glaucon and Socrates (454 c–d). When trying to answer such difficult questions pertaining to the definition of justice, Plato identifies <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> “introduce every form of difference and sameness in nature” instead we must focus on [...] "the one form of sameness and difference that was relevant to the particular ways of life themselves” which is the form of the Good. This form is the basis for understanding all other forms, it is what allows us to understand everything else. Through the conversation between Socrates and Glaucon (508 a–c) Plato analogizes the form of the Good with the sun as it is what allows us to see things. [...] Here, Plato describes how the sun allows for sight. [...] But he makes a very important distinction, “sun is not sight” but it is “the cause of sight itself.” [...] As the sun is in the visible realm, the form of Good is in the intelligible realm. It is “what gives truth to the things known and the power to know to the knower”. [...] It is not only the “cause of knowledge and truth, it is also an object of knowledge”.|$|E
