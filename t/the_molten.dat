5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also reduces silica {{which has}} {{to be removed from}} the pig iron. The silica is reacted with calcium oxide (burned limestone) and forms a slag which floats to the surface of <b>the</b> <b>molten</b> pig iron. The direct contact of flue gas with the iron causes contamination with sulfur if it is present in the fuel. Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.|$|E

5|$|Berkelium forms a {{trigonal}} (η5–C5H5)3Bk metallocene complex {{with three}} cyclopentadienyl rings, {{which can be}} synthesized by reacting berkelium(III) chloride with <b>the</b> <b>molten</b> beryllocene (Be(C5H5)2) at about 70 °C. It has an amber color and a density of 2.47 g/cm3. The complex is stable to heating to at least 250 °C, and sublimates without melting at about 350 °C. The high radioactivity of berkelium gradually destroys the compound (within a period of weeks). One cyclopentadienyl ring in (η5–C5H5)3Bk can be substituted by chlorine to yield 2.

5|$|Due to the {{physical}} similarities which they share, the group 12 elements {{can be found in}} many common situations. Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode. These protective coatings can be applied to other metals through by hot-dip galvanizing a substance into <b>the</b> <b>molten</b> form of the metal, or through the process of electroplating which may be passivated by the use of chromate salts. Group 12 elements are also used in electrochemistry as they may act {{as an alternative to the}} standard hydrogen electrode in addition to being a secondary reference electrode.|$|E
5|$|If {{the amount}} of current used exceeds the {{capability}} of the electrode, tungsten inclusions in the weld may result. Known as tungsten spitting, this can be identified with radiography and can be prevented by changing the type of electrode or increasing the electrode diameter. In addition, if the electrode is not well protected by the gas shield or the operator accidentally allows it to contact <b>the</b> <b>molten</b> metal, it can become dirty or contaminated. This often causes the welding arc to become unstable, requiring that the electrode be ground with a diamond abrasive to remove the impurity.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to carbon fiber, glass can undergo more elongation before it breaks. Thinner filaments can bend further before they break. The viscosity of <b>the</b> <b>molten</b> glass {{is very important}} for manufacturing success. During drawing, the process where the hot glass is pulled to reduce the diameter of the fiber, the viscosity must be relatively low. If it is too high, the fiber will break during drawing. However, if it is too low, the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a fiber.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} material properties for the dies are thermal shock resistance and softening at elevated temperature; other important properties include hardenability, machinability, heat checking resistance, weldability, availability (especially for larger dies), and cost. The longevity of a die is directly {{dependent on the}} temperature of <b>the</b> <b>molten</b> metal and the cycle time. The dies used in die casting are usually made out of hardened tool steels, because cast iron cannot withstand the high pressures involved, therefore the dies are very expensive, resulting in high start-up costs. Metals that are cast at higher temperatures require dies made from higher alloy steels.|$|E
5|$|The {{motion of}} the fluid is {{sustained}} by convection, motion driven by buoyancy. The temperature increases towards {{the center of the}} Earth, and the higher temperature of the fluid lower down makes it buoyant. This buoyancy is enhanced by chemical separation: As the core cools, some of <b>the</b> <b>molten</b> iron solidifies and is plated to the inner core. In the process, lighter elements are left behind in the fluid, making it lighter. This is called compositional convection. A Coriolis effect, caused by the overall planetary rotation, tends to organize the flow into rolls aligned along the north-south polar axis.|$|E

5|$|The slag melts in {{the heat}} of the furnace. In the bottom of the furnace, <b>the</b> <b>molten</b> slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and {{apertures}} in the side of the furnace are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately.

5|$|These {{are used}} when the casting alloy {{cannot be used}} in hot-chamber machines; these include aluminium, zinc alloys with a large {{composition}} of aluminium, magnesium and copper. The process for these machines start with melting the metal in a separate furnace. Then a precise amount of molten metal is transported to the cold-chamber machine where it is fed into an unheated shot chamber (or injection cylinder). This shot is then driven into the die by a hydraulic or mechanical piston. The biggest disadvantage of this system is the slower cycle time due {{to the need to}} transfer <b>the</b> <b>molten</b> metal from the furnace to the cold-chamber machine.|$|E

5|$|When no {{porosity}} {{is allowed}} {{in a cast}} part then the pore-free casting process is used. It {{is identical to the}} standard process except oxygen is injected into the die before each shot to purge any air from the mold cavity. This causes small dispersed oxides to form when <b>the</b> <b>molten</b> metal fills the die, which virtually eliminates gas porosity. An added advantage to this is greater strength. Unlike standard die castings, these castings can be heat treated and welded. This process can be performed on aluminium, zinc, and lead alloys.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth {{travels in}} crude lead bullion (which can contain up to 10% bismuth) through several stages of refining, {{until it is}} removed by the Kroll-Betterton process which {{separates}} the impurities as slag, or the electrolytic Betts process.
