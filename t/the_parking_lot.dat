40|$|Introduction Recent {{studies of}} public {{underground}} <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> showed <b>the</b> influence of radon concentration and the probable discomfort caused by parking cars. Materials and Methods Radon concentration {{was measured in}} semi-closed public <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> in <b>the</b> six governorates of Kuwait, using Durridge RAD 7 radon detector (USA). Results The peak radon concentration in <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> of Kuwait governorates was relatively higher during winter (63. 15 Bq/m 3) compared to summer (41. 73 Bq/m 3). Radon in <b>the</b> evaluated <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> revealed a mean annual absorbed dose (DRn: 0. 02 mSv/y) and annual effective dose (HE: 0. 06 mSv/y).   Conclusion This study validated the influence of relative humidity and temperature as the major components of discomfort index (DI). The mean annual absorbed and effective dose  of radon in <b>the</b> evaluated <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> were found below the permissible limits. However, high radon DRn and HE were reported when the assessment included <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>lots,</b> <b>the</b> surrounding residential apartments, and office premises. Furthermore, the time-series analysis indicated significant variations of the seasonal and site-wise distribution of radon concentrations in <b>the</b> indoor evaluated <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> of <b>the</b> six Kuwait governorate...|$|R
