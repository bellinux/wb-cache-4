5|$|It is a centuries-old custom for Jews {{to place}} kvitelach {{containing}} personal prayers to God between {{the stones of}} <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> in Jerusalem. This practice has been also adopted by Christian pilgrims and foreign dignitaries as well. More than a million prayer notes are placed in <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> each year.|$|E
5|$|The kvitelach {{placed in}} <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> {{differ from the}} kvitelach given in Hasidic courts, as they contain prayers, {{requests}} or messages written directly to God. These prayer notes are folded and wedged into the cracks and crevices of the Wall. The rationale for this practice has been traced to the Midrashic teaching that the Divine Presence has never moved from <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall,</b> and the Kabbalistic teaching that all prayers ascend to Heaven through the Temple Mount, which <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> abuts. More than a million prayer notes are placed in <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> each year.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of the arch along <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>wall</b> of the Temple Mount, yet {{at a distance from}} <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> plaza, has prompted the Israeli Government to allow the area to be used for alternative (non-Orthodox)services.|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} of placing prayer notes in <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> {{has also been}} adopted by Christian pilgrims and people of other faiths. Foreign dignitaries who have publicly placed a kvitel in <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> include Pope John Paul II in 2000, U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton in 2005, Pope Benedict XVI in 2008, U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama in 2008, and U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his wife Ann in 2012. Pope Francis inserted a handwritten Spanish language text of the Lord's Prayer in the Wall during his visit in 2014. On May 22, 2017, Donald Trump became the first sitting U.S. President to visit the Wall; he also inserted a note.|$|E
5|$|According to the Quran and Islamic traditions, al-Aqsa Mosque is {{the place}} from which Muhammad went on a night journey (al-isra) during which he rode on Buraq, who took him from Mecca to al-Aqsa.

5|$|Although Herod's {{renovation}} of the Second Temple was initiated in late 1st century BCE, excavations beneath the street near the arch revealed three oil lamps of a type common {{in the first century}} CE and 17 identifiable coins, several of which were struck by Valerius Gratus, Roman procurator of Judea, in the year 17/18 CE. This means that the arch and nearby sections of <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> were constructed after this date.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> Heritage Foundation {{initiated}} a major renovation effort under Rabbi-of-the-Wall Shmuel Rabinovitch.

5|$|In Judaism, <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> is venerated as {{the sole}} remnant of the Holy Temple. It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, {{as it is the}} closest {{permitted}} accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the Even ha-shetiya or Foundation Stone, which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by Kareth. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the Dome of the Rock is the Foundation Stone, some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall,</b> near the El-kas fountain. This spot was the site of the Holy of Holies when the Temple stood.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} source mentioning {{this specific}} site {{as a place}} of worship is from the 16th century. The previous sites used by Jews for mourning the destruction of the Temple, during periods when access to the city was prohibited to them, lay to the east, on the Mount of Olives and in the Kidron Valley below it. From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the Zionist movement in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence {{at the foot of the}} wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly riot in 1929 in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the Jewish quarter, and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall.</b> This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the Six-Day War. Three days after establishing control over <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> site the Moroccan Quarter was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> plaza.|$|E

5|$|After the {{foundation}} of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932, the mosque underwent several major modifications. In 1951 King Ibn Saud (1932–1953) ordered demolitions around the mosque to make way for new wings to the east and west of the prayer hall, which consisted of concrete columns with pointed arches. Older columns were reinforced with concrete and braced with copper rings at the top. The Suleymaniyya and Majidiyya minarets were replaced by two minarets in Mamluk revival style. Two additional minarets were erected to the northeast and northwest of the mosque. A library was built along <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>wall</b> to house historic Qurans and other religious texts.|$|E
5|$|Another legend is that once, while Vishnu and Brahma contested for superiority, Shiva {{appeared}} as a flame, and challenged them to find his source. Brahma {{took the form of}} a swan, and flew to the sky to see the top of the flame, while Vishnu became the boar Varaha, and sought its base. The scene is called lingothbava, and is represented in <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>wall</b> at the sanctum of most Shiva temples. Neither Brahma nor Vishnu could find the source, and while Vishnu conceded his defeat, Brahma lied and said he had found the pinnacle. In punishment, Shiva ordained that Brahma would never have temples on earth in his worship.|$|E
5|$|As constructed, {{the main}} {{facade of the}} station faced Glenwood Avenue.

The first floor (at track level) featured a large waiting room occupying the entire center block, with vault lights providing natural illumination and a fountain set into <b>the</b> <b>western</b> <b>wall.</b> Restrooms, a kitchen, and a cafe occupied the wings.|$|E

5|$|At the {{southern}} end of <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall,</b> Robinson's Arch along with a row of vaults once supported stairs ascending from the street to the Temple Mount. Because it does not come under the direct control of the Rabbi of the Wall or the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the site has been opened to religious groups that hold worship services that would not be approved by the Rabbi or the Ministry in the major men's and women's prayer areas against the Wall.|$|E
5|$|Commissioner Edward Keith-Roach {{described}} {{the screen as}} violating the Ottoman status quo that forbade Jews from making any construction in <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall</b> area. He informed the Jewish community that the removal had been carried out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the Supreme Muslim Council. The Arabs were concerned that the Jews were trying to extend their rights at the wall and with this move, ultimately intended to take possession of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The British government issued an announcement explaining the incident and blaming the Jewish beadle at the Wall. It stressed that {{the removal of the}} screen was necessary, but expressed regret over the ensuing events.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Old City {{together}} with the Wall was controlled by Jordan. Article VIII of the 1949 Armistice Agreement provided for Israeli Jewish access to <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Wall.</b> However, for the following nineteen years, despite numerous requests by Israeli officials and Jewish groups to the United Nations and other international bodies to attempt to enforce the armistice agreement, Jordan refused to abide by this clause. Neither Israeli Arabs nor Israeli Jews could visit their holy places in the Jordanian territories.|$|E
