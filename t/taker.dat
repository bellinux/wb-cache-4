5|$|The {{main event}} was a Biker Chain {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker. During the match, a chain was hung on a pole above the ring, and once it was {{retrieved}} {{it could be used}} as a legal weapon. After enduring a series of punches from Lesnar, Undertaker attempted to take the chain down, but the lights in the arena went out and he climbed back down to the ring. <b>Taker</b> then executed a piledriver on Lesnar onto the ring steps. <b>Taker</b> put Lesnar in a dragon sleeper. After getting out of the hold, Lesnar executed a F-5 to <b>Taker.</b> Lesnar made an attempt to go for the chain, but <b>Taker</b> performed a chokeslam off the top rope. Following this, The Full Blooded Italians interfered in the match, trying to attack <b>Taker.</b> <b>Taker</b> threw them out of the ring and did a suicide dive onto them after performing a Last Ride on Lesnar. He then retrieved the chain off the pole and wrapped it around it his fist, planning to strike Lesnar with it. Vince McMahon interfered and pushed <b>Taker</b> off the top rope. Lesnar then punched <b>Taker</b> with the chain to retain the title.|$|E

30|$|The test <b>takers</b> of {{the entire}} pool of 13, 745 test <b>takers</b> were {{randomly}} reduced to 2000 for each group. The reference and focal group had {{the same number of}} test <b>takers.</b> In addition, in order to guard against unrepresentativeness within each group, we used an equal number of test <b>takers</b> with different characteristics of gender to facilitate comparisons. In other words, when examining effects of key universities on the GSEEE, a stratified sample of 1000 female test <b>takers</b> from key universities and 1000 male test <b>takers</b> from non-key universities were selected as the focal group; and a sample of 1000 female test <b>takers</b> from non-key universities and 1000 male test <b>takers</b> from non-key universities were selected as the reference group. This type of stratified random sampling allows us to examine group effects with test <b>takers</b> from a diverse spectrum of characteristics and capture the major variations between the examined groups. DIF and DBF results were validated by multiple rounds of sampling with reference and focal groups.|$|R

5|$|Apart {{from being}} a capable passer, Lin has {{established}} himself as a strong, fast-paced offensive player who attacks the basket and excels at the pick-and-roll. He improved his outside shooting from early in his career, and became a threat from three-point range. He has also been considered difficult to defend at times because of his ability to get to the free-throw line. An admitted risk <b>taker,</b> he has been criticized for his tendency to commit turnovers, as well as his perceived lack of effectiveness on defense.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1950s Barnes {{was one of}} the senior players in the side, and succeeded Roy Paul as captain when Paul retired in 1957. During the 1957–58 season Barnes became the third player to score a hat-trick of {{penalties}} in an English top-flight match, as part of a 6–2 defeat of Everton. At this time Barnes was the club's primary penalty <b>taker,</b> helping him to score 11 goals {{over the course of the}} season. In his later years at Manchester City, Barnes role as captain meant he had become a strong influence on younger players. A particularly notable example was Denis Law, who joined the club in 1960, the pair becoming lifelong friends.|$|E

5|$|A complete, {{tenacious}} {{and consistent}} two-footed player, Nedvěd frequently played as a left-sided, offensive wide midfielder or as a left-winger throughout his career, {{due to his}} crossing ability with his left foot, as well as due to his ability to cut inside and shoot with his right foot, although {{he was capable of}} playing anywhere in midfield due to his offensive and defensive work-rate. He was also deployed as a central midfielder on occasion, as well as in an attacking midfield and playmaking role, or as a supporting striker, where he excelled as an assist-man due to his excellent dribbling ability, passing range and vision. Primarily known for his powerful shots and volleys from distance, as well as his stamina, he was also noted for his speed, endurance, technique and goal-scoring ability.

50|$|Anxiety {{reactions}} can {{be generalized}} from previous experiences to testing situations.

Baggio finished the season with 10 goals in all competitions, in 34 appearances; 7 of his goals were scored in Serie A, in 28 appearances, and he also provided 10 assists in Serie A. He became one of the six players to win the Scudetto in consecutive years with different teams, and was voted the club's best player of the season by the fans, despite playing a more creative role. Towards the end of the season, Baggio had disagreements with Capello due to limited playing time, as Capello believed he was no longer fit enough to play for 90 minutes; although Baggio frequently started matches, he was often substituted during the second half.|$|E

5|$|Galatasaray's Ergün Penbe {{stepped up}} {{to take the first}} spot kick and scored. He placed the ball inside the near {{right-hand}} corner, just past Seaman, who dived to his left. Davor Šuker was the first man up to take Arsenal's penalty kick. His effort proved to be unsuccessful, as the ball hit the left-hand post and bounced off the goal. Şükür became the next player to take Galatasaray's spot kick. He scored as he lobbed the ball in the right-hand corner. With Galatasaray leading 2–0, Arsenal's next penalty <b>taker</b> was Parlour. He placed the ball on the spot and successfully scored by burying the ball to Taffarel's right to make it 2–1.

50|$|Unlike a non{{standardized}} test, {{the time}} needed by test <b>takers</b> to prepare for standardized tests is less variable and usually considerable. This is because standardized tests are usually uniform in scope, format, and difficulty and often have important consequences {{with respect to a}} test <b>taker's</b> future such as a test <b>taker's</b> eligibility to attend a specific university program or to enter a desired profession. It is not unusual for test <b>takers</b> to prepare for standardized tests by relying upon commercially available books that provide in-depth coverage of the standardized test or compilations of previous tests (e.g., 10 year series in Singapore). In many countries, test <b>takers</b> even enroll in test preparation centers or cram schools that provide extensive or supplementary instructions to test <b>takers</b> to help them better prepare for a standardized test. In Hong Kong, {{it has been suggested that}} the tutors running such centers are celebrities in their own right.

We determine that <b>takers</b> who have more information tend to act and explain themselves more strategically.
