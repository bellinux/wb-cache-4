[...] Director of RAND International Security and Defense Policy Center, James Dobbins, said of implication for the Syrian civil war that: [...] "I don't think it's viable to stand aside if Syria gets worse and unless the Iranians are stupid enough to give us a better rationale for an unprovoked attack, I don't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> would do it." [...] Head of the Washington D.C.-based Inter-American Dialogue Michael Shifter said of Latin America's reaction to Obama: [...] "immigration issue was an area of disappointment and in general in Latin America there's been disappointment in Obama, which is why I think people would do well to have their expectations in check this time around." [...] "Progress relations with Latin America under Obama has been modest at best, but of course this was a choice. And some of the rhetoric from the Republicans, and from candidate Mitt Romney himself, was a lot more aggressive and made a lot of Latinos and Latin Americans very uneasy." [...] "In the relationship with Cuba, from Washington's point of view, there were steps that were taken in terms of making travel more flexible, lifting restrictions put into place under George W Bush, on remittances." [...] Latin America viewed these moves as [...] "nothing". [...] "It was seen as politically safe and that Obama hasn't been prepared to invest much political capital in the region." [...] "I don't think there is anything to suggest that things will be different this time around. I think the only ray of hope for Latin Americans will be on immigration." ...|$|E

60|$|Up to {{the time}} of which I write, and for years afterwards--I <b>think</b> until <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> of President Juarez--the cultivation, {{manufacture}} and sale of tobacco constituted a government monopoly, and paid the bulk of the revenue collected from internal sources. The price was enormously high, and made successful smuggling very profitable. The difficulty of obtaining tobacco is probably the reason why everybody, male and female, used it at that time. I know from my own experience that when I was at West Point, the fact that tobacco, in every form, was prohibited, and the mere possession of the weed severely punished, made the majority of the cadets, myself included, try to acquire the habit of using it. I failed utterly at the time and for many years afterward; but the majority accomplished the object of their youthful ambition.|$|R

Robert P.

While he allowed that the Supreme Court might accept that argument, [...] "it would be improvident for us to disregard clear judicial precedent in this Circuit based on mere speculation," [...] he wrote. [...] "We <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> orderly <b>administration</b> of justice will be best served if we as one of the inferior courts follow Supreme Court precedent and adhere to the settled law of this Circuit, and a fortiori the district courts should do likewise."

2500|$|After his resignation, {{from his}} post as Commissioner of the Food and Drugs Administration in December 1969, Dr. Herbert L. Ley, Jr. [...] In an {{interview}} to the New York Times, warned {{the public about the}} FDA’s inability to safeguard consumers. People were being misled, he believed “The thing [...] that bugs me is that <b>the</b> people <b>think</b> <b>the</b> FDA is protecting them - it isn’t. What the FDA is doing and what <b>the</b> public <b>thinks</b> it’s doing are as different as night and day,” he said. The agency, in his opinion, did not have the motivation to protect consumers, faced budget shortfalls, and lacked support from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Dr. Ley was critical of Congress, <b>the</b> <b>Administration</b> and <b>the</b> drug industry, he stated that he had [...] "constant, tremendous, sometimes unmerciful pressure" [...] from the drug industry and that the drug company lobbyists, combined with the politicians who worked on behalf of their patrons, could bring “tremendous pressure” to bear on him and his staff, to try preventing FDA restrictions on their drugs. The interview concluded with Ley stating that the entire issue was about money, “pure and simple”. On December 15, 1999, interviewed for the oral history program of the FDA History Office, Dr. Ley shared that from the first controversy in his tenure as FDA Commissioner he had a [...] "gut feeling" [...] that his life expectancy at the FDA was probably limited. He said he had done everything by the book, both in the FDA and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and he <b>thinks</b> that what <b>the</b> <b>Administration</b> was really wishing, was that he would stonewall the whole Academy report, because it was goring too many pharmaceutical companies.|$|R

40|$|This {{is a study}} about {{employment}} {{officers at}} the Swedish public employment service. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine how they understand and use their discretion in their daily work. We used a qualitative method and the data was gathered by semi-structured interviews with eight employment officers working at the same office in a small town in Sweden. Lipskys theory about street-level bureaucracy and Lazarus description of coping theory are applied to analyze the empirical data. The work for the Swedish employment officers have changed over the last years with an increasing focus on control and <b>administration.</b> <b>The</b> results from the study show that the employment officers considered that they have a freedom of action in their daily work about planning their meetings, but all of them <b>thinks</b> that <b>the</b> <b>administration,</b> and <b>the</b> fact that they have to handle too many unemployed means that they are lack of time, what leads to a negative impact on their discretion. All of the interviewed subjects indicated that the Swedish public employment service has a top-down organization. We found that the informants used a unified strategy to cope dilemmas by referring to the existing laws, both when they handled disgruntled unemployed and even as a way to cope their own liable situations. They could interpret the laws in different ways and they took help from the colleagues at the local office to decide how to interpret the laws. Even if dilemma was common in their work with the unemployed, they considered that their mission to control was mainly positive. The main reasons, to how the employment officers margin for manoeuvre are limited, appears to be the laws, the regulations and the available efforts for the unemployed...|$|R

"When The Gallup Organizations poll in 1939 asked, Do you <b>think</b> <b>the</b> {{attitude}} of <b>the</b> Roosevelt <b>administration</b> toward business is delaying business recovery? the American people responded yes {{by a margin}} of more than two-to-one.
