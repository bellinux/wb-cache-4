The first scheduled service flew on 24 January 2005, carrying eight passengers.

25|$|That the Canberra was {{a foreign}} {{aircraft}} meant that its superiority {{in terms of}} performance did not guarantee political support, {{in spite of the}} urgent need, particularly in light of there being several rival indigenous aircraft designs; there were also doubts about production availability with English Electric being able <b>to</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>with</b> USAF demands, as well as questions over continued spares support. In March 1951, many of these questions were answered when, in part due to its production lines being sustained at full capacity to meet orders from the Royal Air Force in addition to those emerging from other export customers, English Electric entered into discussions with Glenn L. Martin Company, under which it was proposed that Martin would receive a license to domestically build the Canberra in the United States. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, the Americanization of the Canberra program proved effective at dismissing many of the political opponents that had opposed the project.|$|E

40|$|Figure 1 : Subdivision of planar-quad meshes (left) {{and editing}} of {{polyhedral}} <b>meshes</b> <b>with</b> map prescription (right). We present a novel framework for polyhedral <b>mesh</b> editing <b>with</b> face-based projective maps, that preserves pla-narity by definition. Such meshes are essential {{in the field}} of architectural design and rationalization. By using homogeneous coordinates to describe vertices, we can parametrize the entire shape space of planar-preserving deformations with bilinear equations. The generality of this space allows for polyhedral geometric processing methods to be conducted with ease. We demonstrate its usefulness in planar-quadrilateral mesh subdivision, a resulting multi-resolution editing algorithm, and novel shape-space exploration with prescribed transformations. Furthermore, we show that our shape space is a discretization of a continuous space of conjugate-preserving projective transformation fields on surfaces. Our shape space directly addresses planar-quad meshes, on which we put a focus, and we further show that our framework naturally extends <b>to</b> <b>meshes</b> <b>with</b> faces of more than four vertices as well...|$|R
