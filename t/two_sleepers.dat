6000|$|The {{cries of}} the foul birds awoke the <b>two</b> <b>sleepers</b> who stared about [20] them in bewilderment. The man {{staggered}} {{to his feet and}} looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts. His face assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he passed his boney hand over his eyes. [...] "This is what they call delirium, I guess," [...] he muttered.

60|$|While the two {{men were}} sleeping, a change came over the scene--a slow, gentle, scarce {{perceptible}} change, which, however, had a powerful influence on the prospects of the sleepers. The sky became overcast; the temperature, which had been down at arctic depth for many months, suddenly rose to that of temperate climes, and snow began to fall--not in the small sharp particles to which the fur-traders of the great northern wilderness are accustomed, but in the broad, heavy flakes that one often sees in England. Softly, silently, gently they fell, like the descent of a sweet influence--but steadily, persistently, continuously, until every object in nature became smothered in the soft white garment. Among other objects the <b>two</b> <b>sleepers</b> were buried.|$|E
60|$|The snow {{began by}} {{powdering}} them over. Had any one {{been there to}} observe the process, he would have seen by the bright light of the camp-fire that the green blankets {{in which they were}} wrapt became piebald first; then assumed a greyish-green colour, which speedily changed into a greenish-grey, and finally into a pure white. The <b>two</b> <b>sleepers</b> might thus have represented those figures in chiselled marble on the tombs of crusaders, had it not been that they lay doubled up, for warmth--perhaps also for comfort--with their knees at their chins, instead of flat on their backs with their hands pressed together. By degrees the correct outline of their forms became an incorrect outline, and gradually more and more rotund--suggesting the idea that the buried ones were fat.|$|E

The nurse was out, and we <b>two</b> <b>sleepers</b> were alone. A spark from the wood-fire was shot out, and it lit on the slope of the tent. I suppose a quiet interval followed, then a scream from the baby awoke me, and there was that tent flaming up toward the ceiling! Before I could think, I sprang to the floor in my fright, and in a second was half-way to the door; but in the next half-second my mother's farewell was sounding in my ears, and I was back on the bed again. I reached my head through the flames and dragged the baby out by the waist-band, and tugged it along, and we fell to the floor together in a cloud of smoke; I snatched a new hold, and dragged the screaming little creature along and out at the door and around the bend of the hall, and was still tugging away, all excited and happy and proud, when the master's voice shouted: ...|$|E
