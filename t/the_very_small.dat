5|$|Although {{observations}} using {{adaptive optics}} in late 1997 and early 1998 showed a double {{peak in the}} brightness of the nucleus, controversy still exists over whether such observations can only be explained by a binary nucleus. The discovery of the satellite was not confirmed by other observations. Also, while comets have been observed to break up before, no case has previously been found of a stable binary nucleus. Given <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> mass of this comet, the orbit of the binary nucleus would be easily disrupted by the gravity of the Sun and planets.|$|E

5|$|Following {{historical}} sources, Shepseskare was traditionally {{believed to}} have reigned for seven years, succeeding Neferirkare Kakai and preceding Neferefre on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the Egyptologist Miroslav Verner has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted {{only a few months}} at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and Erik Hornung.|$|E
5|$|It {{was once}} {{believed}} that the Central American squirrel monkey was just a population of a South American species of squirrel monkey brought to Central America by humans. Evidence for this theory included <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> range of the Central American squirrel monkey and the large gap from the range of any other squirrel monkey species. A study of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA demonstrated that the Central American squirrel monkey is indeed a separate species that apparently diverged from the South American species long ago – at least 260,000 years ago and possibly more than 4 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|In the Geiger–Marsden experiment, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden (colleagues of Rutherford {{working at}} his behest) shot alpha {{particles}} at thin sheets {{of metal and}} measured their deflection {{through the use of}} a fluorescent screen. Given <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> mass of the electrons, the high momentum of the alpha particles, and the low concentration of the positive charge of the plum pudding model, the experimenters expected all the alpha particles to pass through the metal foil without significant deflection. To their astonishment, a small fraction of the alpha particles experienced heavy deflection. Rutherford concluded that the positive charge of the atom must be concentrated in a very tiny volume to produce an electric field sufficiently intense to deflect the alpha particles so strongly.|$|E

5|$|On {{its first}} advisory, there was {{disagreement}} among forecast models regarding its eventual track, with projected tracks deviating from a Georgia landfall to a track northeastward out to sea. Alpha {{was also a}} climatological outlier at the time; the NHC HURRAN model, {{which was based on}} previous storms with similar characteristics, found no analogs for the storm. Subtropical Storm Alpha was initially well-defined as it moved southwestward. <b>The</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> center was located along {{the eastern edge of the}} convection, while low-level cloud bands formed east of the center. At the time, the temperature structure was more typical of a winter storm, although it was expected to become more like a subtropical storm typical during the summer months. The winds decreased steadily as it turned more westward on May 27, and the heavy rainfall persisted mostly to the north and west of the center.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary role}} of a king was {{to act as a}} war leader, {{reflected}} in <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>small</b> number of minorities or female reigning monarchs in the period. Kings organised the defence of their people's lands, property and persons and negotiated with other kings to secure these things. If they failed to do so, the settlements might be raided, destroyed or annexed and the populations killed or taken into slavery. Kings also engaged in the low-level warfare of raiding and the more ambitious full-scale warfare that led to conflicts of large armies and alliances and which could be undertaken over relatively large distances, like the expedition to Orkney by Dál Riata in 581 or the Northumbrian attack on Ireland in 684.|$|E
