It might be supposed that the Pasha, whose object notoriously was to retain all monoplies in his own hands, would have refused his sanction to such a measure. But it so happened in those days that all the court had ships at Suez: Ibrahim Pasha alone owned four or five. Consequently, they expected to share profits with the merchants, and thus to be compensated for the want of port-dues. From that time forward all the vessels in the harbour were registered, and ordered to sail in rotation. This arrangement benefits the owner of the craft ‘en depart,' giving him in his turn a <b>temporary</b> <b>monopoly,</b> with the advantage of a full market; and freight is so high that a single trip often clears off the expense of building and the risk of losing the ship-a sensible succedaneum for insurance companies. On the contrary, the public must always be a loser by the ‘Farzah.'

40|$|Within {{the trend}} of {{increasing}} patent commercialisation and open innovation, a recent phenomenon where firms give away their patents free of charge can be observed. This seems contradictory to the original intention of the patent system (enabling firms to create <b>temporary</b> <b>monopolies</b> to appropriate returns from their R&D investments). Consequently, this paper explores why firms make their patents available for free and which benefits they may gain from this behaviour. Adopting the open source software phenomenon as a background and using firm data from 26 patent release cases, we identify a typology consisting of four motives of 'free patent release approaches': profit making, cost cutting, innovation catalysing, technology providing. Further, we discuss the motives of these firms to offer their patents as 'open source'. We find that firms may obtain valuable technological input for subsequent innovations {{as well as social}} benefits in return for their free patent release. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|In {{the study}} {{a class of}} multisector network models, {{suitable}} for simulation {{of the interaction between}} production, demand, trade, and infrastructure, is presented. A characteristic feature of the class is a vintage model of the production system. Hence, the rigidities in existing capacities and the <b>temporary</b> <b>monopolies</b> obtainable from investments in new capacity at favourable locations are emphasized. As special cases, the class contains models in the modelling traditions of "interregional computable general equilibriunT, Hspatial price equilibrium**, "interregional input-output" and transportation networks. On the demand side, a multihousehold spatial linear expenditure system is introduced. This allows for an endogenous representation of income effects of skill-differentiated labour. The models are represented by a set of complementarity problems. This facilitates a comparison of model properties and the choice of an appropriate solution algorithm. The study is mainly devoted to single period models. Such equilibrium models are interpreted as adiabatic approximations of processes in continuous time. A separation by the time scale of the processes and an application of the slaving principle should thus govern the choice of endogenous variables in the equilibrium formulation. digitalisering@um...|$|R
50|$|Patents {{essentially}} {{provide a}} <b>temporary</b> <b>monopoly</b> on a product {{to the first}} inventor or firm which comes up with the product. Patents vary in length but are designed to last {{long enough for the}} innovator to make a return on investment. The nature of patents makes them an incentive so long as the product being invented is distributed to consumers through markets. While patented products are in the market, the producer can place any price on the product, regardless of the price of production which typically dictates prices in markets. If a product is not being distributed through markets then a patent cannot provide proper incentive for innovation. Patents do however provide gain through the restriction of information to others. Stiglitz identifies this as a problem of patents for the innovation of drugs and other products being distributed not with the purpose of making a profit, but to solve global problems.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, two US {{non-profit}} organizations unsuccessfully {{sued the}} French company {{in an attempt}} to legally produce Plumpy'Nut in the US without paying the royalty fee. Mike Mellace, president of one of the organizations claimed that “some children are dying because Nutriset prevents other companies from producing a food which could save their lives.” Invalidation of the Nutriset patent may {{have a positive impact on}} populations affected by famine, and studies by humanitarian organizations support the idea that having a single, dominant supplier in Nutriset is undesirable. Critics of Nutriset argue the US patent is “obvious in light of prior recipes” and “that the patent has essentially conferred monopoly power on Nutriset and thus violated the Sherman Act". By definition, a patent grants a <b>temporary</b> <b>monopoly,</b> and Nutriset won the case. Some have suggested a similarity between pharmaceutical company compulsory licensing agreements, in place under the WTO TRIPS Agreement, and Plumpy'Nut.|$|E
50|$|The same {{reasoning}} {{applies to}} patent law. Patents are justified {{on the grounds}} that inventors must be protected so they have incentive to invent. It is therefore argued that it is in society's best interest that inventors receive a temporary government-granted monopoly on their idea, so that they can recoup investment costs and make economic profit for a limited period. In the United States, the length of this <b>temporary</b> <b>monopoly</b> is 20 years from the date the application for patent was filed, though the monopoly does not actually begin until the application has matured into a patent. However, like the drinking-age problem above, the specific length of time would need to be different for every product to be efficient. A 20-year term is used because it is difficult to tell what the number should be for any individual patent. More recently, some, including University of North Dakota law professor Eric E. Johnson, have argued that patents in different kinds of industries - such as software patents - should be protected for different lengths of time.|$|E

40|$|The {{trade-off}} between {{innovation and}} access {{is a critical}} problem in pharmaceutical innovation policy. Without adequate intellectual property protection, knowledge is insufficiently appropriable and the output of innovation is sub-optimal.

This paper explores the topic of pharmaceutical innovation policy by discovering the key legal developments that influence the creation of internationally protected and harmonized minimum standards of IP rights. Equipped with a theoretical understanding of IP as a social contract and knowledge about incentives that the law provides, the status quo system of rewarding pharmaceutical innovation is observed though an analysis of the market for new chemical entities, developing an understanding of the relationship between incentives for innovation and market outcomes. Utilizing an extensive analysis of literature, promising policy options are explored for realigning incentives to better optimize the incremental benefits of pharmaceutical innovation while improving access, including public funding of clinical trials, incorporating value-for-money stipulations into reimbursement and marketing approval decisions, and creating prize-based rewards that delink the market for innovations from the market for pharmaceutical products...|$|R

2500|$|The {{definition}} of non-excludability {{states that it}} is impossible to exclude individuals from consumption.

Similarly, the information in most patents can be used by any party without reducing consumption of that good by others. Official statistics provide a clear example of information goods that are public goods, since they are created to be non-excludable. [...] Creative works may be excludable in some circumstances, however: the individual who wrote the poem may decline to share it with others by not publishing it. Copyrights and patents both encourage the creation of such non-rival goods by providing <b>temporary</b> <b>monopolies,</b> or, in the terminology of public goods, providing a legal mechanism to enforce excludability for a limited period of time. For public goods, the [...] "lost revenue" [...] of the producer of the good is not part of the definition: a public good is a good whose consumption does not reduce any other's consumption of that good.|$|R
