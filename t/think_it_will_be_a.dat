500|$|The episode {{featured}} the song [...] "Montana" [...] by Youth Lagoon {{during the final}} scene. Many viewers wondered if the series creator had changed the ending for the last episode, due to the cancellation of the series. This caused series creator and executive producer Killen to assure viewers that the episode would have been [...] "exactly the same" [...] {{if it had been}} renewed for a second season. In a pre-broadcast interview by Entertainment Weekly with Killen and actor Jason Isaacs, Isaacs claimed that he found it [...] "strangely ironic and amusing" [...] to be promoting the series finale of the Awake series. Killen claimed that [...] "When we wrote the episode, we didn't know it {{would be the end of}} the series". He stated that it had a [...] "satisfying conclusion", [...] "and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> satisfying way to leave the show".|$|E
500|$|Uematsu enjoys writing lyrical pieces, but {{tries not}} to be genre-specific. He asserts that expressing the {{emotions}} he desires {{is more important than}} improving skills: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> shame if we won't be able to cry as we play our own game". The absence of character themes was due to him finding those of Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy VII ineffective. Uematsu considers it reasonable to have character themes if each character has a [...] "highlight" [...] in the game, but he found Final Fantasy VIII only focused on Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartilly as a couple, resulting in the [...] "Eyes on Me" [...] theme. The soundtrack features a Latin choral track [...] "Liberi Fatali", which translates to [...] "Fated Children"; its melody forms a musical theme heard in several other pieces in the soundtrack, such as [...] "SeeD" [...] and [...] "The Landing", while the name of [...] "Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec" [...] is the recurring lyrics in [...] "Liberi Fatali".|$|E

500|$|Regular series {{composer}} Nobuo Uematsu {{wrote the}} soundtrack for Final Fantasy VIII. He tried to base the songs {{off of the}} emotional content of when they would be played, asserting that expressing the emotions he desires {{is more important than}} improving skills: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> shame if we won't be able to cry as we play our own game". He could not determine a character's emotions solely based on the plot, instead using images of appearance and attire—"It's important to know when their emotions are at their height, but it usually takes until a month before release for them to finish the ending dialog...!" [...] In response to a question by IGN music stating that the music of Final Fantasy VIII was very dark and perhaps influenced by the plot of the game, Uematsu stated [...] "the atmosphere of music varies depending on story line, of course, but it's also my intention to put various types of music into one game". The absence of character themes found in the previous two games was due to Uematsu finding those of Final Fantasy VI and Final Fantasy VII ineffective. Uematsu considers it reasonable to have character themes if each character has a [...] "highlight" [...] in the game, but he found Final Fantasy VIII only focused on Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartilly as a couple, resulting in the [...] "Eyes on Me" [...] theme.|$|E

From the onset of his appointment as Premier, Surayud Chulanont was urged by academics to override the junta's control of the constitution drafting process. Somchai Siripreechakul, Dean of Law at Chiang Mai University, urged Surayud to call a general election {{as soon as possible}} and hand the task of drafting a charter to an elected parliament.

De Pablo agreed, saying, [...] "I would think if the characters get together, the whole mystery would be done.

[...] She elaborated in another interview, [...] "My character has sort of this understated flirtation with Michael's character, Tony. She gets jealous, but I think she would never admit it or hook up with someone in the workplace. He scares her to death. He is the epitome of the American man and {{all of the things that}} come out of his mouth are brutally stupid." ...|$|E
2500|$|Report of a sad case {{recently}} {{tried before}} the Lord Mayor, Owen versus Huxley. Lord Mayor asks whether either side {{is known to}} the police: Policeman X— Huxley, your Worship, I take to be a young hand, but very vicious; but Owen I have seen before. He got into trouble with an old bone man, called Mantell, who never could be off complaining as Owen prigged his bones. People did say {{that the old man}} never got over it, and Owen worritted him to death; but I don't think it was so bad as that. Hears as Owen takes the chair at a crib in Bloomsbury. I don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> harmonic meeting altogether. And Huxley hangs out in Jermyn Street. (Tom Huxley's 'low set' included Hooker 'in the green and vegetable line' and 'Charlie Darwin, the pigeon-fancier'; Owen's 'crib in Bloomsbury' was the British Museum, of which Natural History was but one department. Jermyn Street is known for its shops of men's clothing, possibly implying that Huxley was a dandy.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{title track}} and opening song, [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again", was {{compared}} to her debut single, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), featuring a slap-and-pop bassline, synthesizer chord stabs and a mechanized beat. Lyrically, the song sees Spears warning to an overeager prospective lover: [...] "Oops, you think I'm in love/That I'm sent from above — I'm not that innocent." [...] The song also breaks down for a spoken-word interlude, involving {{a line from the}} film Titanic (1997). The second track [...] "Stronger" [...] is a synthpop and R track, which is lyrically a declaration of independence, where Spears leaves a partner who treats her like property. The line [...] "my loneliness ain't killing me no more" [...] makes reference to the verse [...] "my loneliness is killing me" [...] from her song [...] "...Baby One More Time". Another R track, which also adds a bit more funk to the mix, [...] "Don't Go Knocking on My Door" [...] finds Spears confidently forging ahead after a breakup. The fourth track, a cover of the Rolling Stones' [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", begins with mushy guitar plucking and breathy coos, until a dry, crackling lockstep is thrown down, turning the song into an urban stomp. The dance-pop version also jettisons the song's final verse and adds some new lyrics ("how white my shirts could be" [...] becomes [...] "how tight my skirt should be"). [...] " [...] was my idea [...] ", Spears said. [...] "I was just like, 'I like this song,' and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> really cool combination working with [...] Rodney [...] and doing a really funky song like that." [...] The fifth track, [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", was co-written by country-pop singer-songwriter Shania Twain and her then-husband, producer Robert [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, who also produced the track. The ballad, which boasts a slinky keyboard riff and Lange's characteristically lavish production, finds Spears allowing a bit of country twang into her vocals as she begs a lover to reveal his feelings: [...] "My friends say you're into me ... but I need to hear it straight from you", she sings. The sixth track [...] "What U See (Is What U Get)" [...] demands respect by rebuking a jealous partner, while the seventh track, [...] "Lucky", is a heart-rending tale of a Hollywood starlet's loneliness, proving that fame can be empty. [...] "If there's nothing missing in my life/Then why do these tears come at night?", she asks. [...] "School crush" [...] is the theme of [...] "One Kiss from You", a track that has a reggae-style beat and lyrics about the feelings of falling in love, and the quickness of it, with Spears cooing that after only one kiss she sees her entire future with her lover. The ballad [...] "Where Are You Now" [...] talks about wanting to know where a previous love is, and what that person is up to, so that she can finally let them go and find closure. Lines on [...] "Can't Make You Love Me", an Europop song, state that fancy cars and money pale in comparison to true love, with Spears singing: [...] "I'm just a girl with a crush on you." [...] The mid-tempo, synth-backed [...] "When Your Eyes Say It", written by songwriter Diane Warren, combines a string section with a loping hip hop beat, while Spears makes her own songwriting debut on the modest, keyboard-driven ballad [...] "Dear Diary", which she said is autobiographical. On the track, she sings of wanting to become [...] "so much more than friends" [...] with a boy.|$|E
