40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, we {{measured}} the morphometric and histological {{changes in the}} cyprinid loach, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, during <b>the</b> early period <b>of</b> growth. Eyes, yolk length, yolk height, and yolk volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> larva decreased for 16 days post hatching (DPH) (P 0. 05), the most anterior extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head × <b>the</b> posterior end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supraoccipital, the most anterior extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head × <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dorsal fin, the most anterior extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head × <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pectoral fin, <b>the</b> posterior end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supraoccipital × <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pelvic fin, and <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dorsal fin × <b>the</b> ventral <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> caudal fin gradually decreased, whereas the most anterior extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head × <b>the</b> dorsal <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> caudal fin, <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dorsal fin × <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anal fin, <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dorsal fin × <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pectoral fin, and <b>the</b> insertion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dorsal fin × <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pelvic fin gradually increased (P< 0. 05). In the cyprinid loach, the retina is composed <b>of</b> six layers: <b>the</b> epithelial layer, ganglion cell layer, inner nuclear layer, inner plexiform layer, outer limiting membrane, and rod and cone layer (RCL). After hatching, part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RCL gradually increased in density. The kidney and midgut epithelium were already formed in the cyprinid loach just after hatching and grew gradually in subsequent days...|$|R
