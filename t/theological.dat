5|$|Based on Henry VIII's {{desire for}} an {{annulment}} {{of his marriage}} (first requested of Pope Clement VII in 1527), the English Reformation was at the outset more of a political affair than a <b>theological</b> dispute. The reality of political differences between Rome and England allowed growing <b>theological</b> disputes {{to come to the}} fore.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Princeton <b>Theological</b> Seminary was reorganized to {{make the}} school's {{leadership}} and faculty more representative of the wider church rather than just Old School Presbyterianism. Two of the seminary's new board members were signatories to the Auburn Affirmation. In order to preserve Princeton's Old School legacy, Machen {{and several of his}} colleagues founded Westminster <b>Theological</b> Seminary.|$|E
5|$|In response, 63 presbyteries {{petitioned the}} General Assembly {{to take action}} against Briggs. The 1891 General Assembly vetoed his {{appointment}} to Union <b>Theological</b> Seminary's chair of biblical studies, and two years later Briggs was found guilty of heresy and suspended from the ministry. Ultimately, Union <b>Theological</b> Seminary refused to remove Briggs from his position and severed its ties to the Presbyterian Church.|$|E
5|$|Not {{unlike the}} circuit riders in the Episcopal and Methodist traditions, the presbyteries often sent out licentiates to {{minister}} in multiple congregations that were {{spread out over}} a wide area. To meet the need for educated clergy, Princeton <b>Theological</b> Seminary and Union Presbyterian Seminary were founded in 1812, followed by Auburn <b>Theological</b> Seminary in 1821.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{founded the}} <b>Theological</b> Repository in 1768, a journal {{committed}} to the open and rational inquiry of <b>theological</b> questions. Although he promised to print any contribution, only like-minded authors submitted articles. He was therefore obliged to provide much of the journal's content himself (this material {{became the basis for}} many of his later <b>theological</b> and metaphysical works). After only a few years, {{due to a lack of}} funds, he was forced to cease publishing the journal. He revived it in 1784 with similar results.|$|E
5|$|The King's College London Act 1903, {{abolished}} all remaining religious {{tests for}} staff, except within the <b>Theological</b> department. In 1910, King's was (with {{the exception of}} the <b>Theological</b> department) merged into the University of London under the King's College London (Transfer) Act 1908, losing its legal independence.|$|E
5|$|The Reformed Church in America (RCA) {{operates}} two seminaries in the United States—New Brunswick <b>Theological</b> Seminary and the Western <b>Theological</b> Seminary {{founded in}} 1866 in Holland, Michigan.

5|$|After several {{conflicts}} with the school's administration, Leontovych got a new job as a teacher of church music and calligraphy at the <b>Theological</b> College in Tyvriv. Besides working with the college choir, Leontovych organized an amateur orchestra that often performed at college events. As he did earlier with choirs, Leontovych included arrangements of folk songs among the usual religious works sung in <b>theological</b> schools. These included arrangements by Mykola Lysenko, his own choral arrangements of folk songs, and entirely original works. One such work {{was based on a}} poem by Taras Shevchenko titled “Зоре моя вечірняя” (Oh my evening star).|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{doctrine}} {{has developed}} over the centuries, reflecting direct teachings of early Christians, formal definitions of heretical and orthodox beliefs by ecumenical councils and in papal bulls, and <b>theological</b> debate by scholars. The Church believes that it is continually guided by the Holy Spirit as it discerns new <b>theological</b> issues and is protected infallibly from falling into doctrinal error when a firm decision on an issue is reached.|$|E
5|$|Chavrusa is {{the name}} of the {{magazine}} of the Rabbinic Alumni of the Rabbi Isaac Elchanan <b>Theological</b> Seminary, published since the late 1950s.|$|E

5|$|Following his resignation, Breckinridge {{shifted his}} party {{affiliation}} from Whig to Know-Nothing to Republican. In 1853, he helped found Danville <b>Theological</b> Seminary in Danville, Kentucky, becoming a Professor of Exegetic, Didactic and Polemic Theology.|$|E
5|$|For years Peckham {{taught at}} Paris, {{where he was}} in contact {{with many of the}} leading {{scholars}} of his time, including Thomas Aquinas. He famously debated Aquinas on at least two occasions during 1269 and 1270, during which Peckham defended the conservative <b>theological</b> position, and Thomas put forth his views on the soul. The Thomist doctrine of the unity of form was condemned after these debates. His <b>theological</b> works later were used by his pupil Roger Marston who in turn inspired Duns Scotus.|$|E
5|$|Géza Vermes {{says that}} the {{doctrine}} of the virgin birth of Jesus arose from <b>theological</b> development rather than from historical events.|$|E
5|$|Heavily {{influenced}} by two major American revival movements—the holiness {{movement of the}} late 19th century and the Pentecostal revival of the early 20th century—the church's <b>theological</b> roots derive from John Wesley's teachings on sanctification.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, Leontovych {{began his}} {{studies at the}} <b>theological</b> seminary in Kamianets-Podilskyi, which both his father and {{grandfather}} had attended. His younger brother Oleksandr was enrolled as well, graduating two years after Mykola.|$|E

5|$|In his book, Light Of The World: The Pope, The Church and The Signs Of The Times, Benedict XVI had espoused {{the idea}} of abdication on health grounds which already had some <b>theological</b> respectability.|$|E
5|$|In his own time, Bede was as {{well known}} for his biblical commentaries and exegetical, {{as well as other}} <b>theological</b> works. The {{majority}} of his writings were of this type, and covered the Old Testament and the New Testament. Most survived the Middle Ages, but a few were lost. It was for his <b>theological</b> writings that he earned the title of Doctor Anglorum, and why he was made a saint.|$|E
5|$|In the 1850s, {{the student}} bodies of Rutgers College and the Seminary began to expand, {{overcrowding}} the space provided at the Queens Campus. The seminary professors realized that students renting rooms at boarding {{houses in the}} city were paying more for their housing than students at other seminaries—over double the costs of housing at New York City's Union <b>Theological</b> Seminary or at nearby Princeton <b>Theological</b> Seminary. The professors surmised {{that it would be}} cheaper to build a seminary building that provided both student housing and instruction space.|$|E
5|$|In the 19th century, King's College London {{had five}} departments: <b>Theological,</b> General Literature and Science, Applied Sciences, Medical and Military.

5|$|John Sigismund {{showed a}} {{particular}} interest in religious matters and initiated several debates among the representatives of diverse <b>theological</b> schools. The first debate was held between Lutheran and Calvinist priests in Medgyes (now Mediaș in Romania) in January 1560. A {{year and a half}} later, John Sigismund sent letters to the University of Wittenberg and other <b>theological</b> centers in Germany to seek advice on the main points of the two Protestant schools of thought.|$|E

25|$|Strong <b>theological</b> {{determinism}} is not {{compatible with}} metaphysical libertarian free will, {{and is a}} form of hard <b>theological</b> determinism (equivalent to <b>theological</b> fatalism below). It claims that free will does not exist, and God has absolute control over a person's actions. Hard <b>theological</b> determinism is similar in implication to hard determinism, although it does not invalidate compatibilist free will. Hard <b>theological</b> determinism {{is a form of}} <b>theological</b> incompatibilism (see figure, top left).|$|E
