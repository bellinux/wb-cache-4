5|$|Early {{fish from}} the fossil record are {{represented}} {{by a group of}} small, jawless, armored fish known as ostracoderms. Jawless fish lineages are mostly extinct. An extant clade, the lampreys may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish. The first jaws are found in Placodermi fossils. The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a jawed mouth. It is unclear if <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, or a combination of factors.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian Army, brutally assailed by {{an unparalleled}} {{surprise}} attack, grappling with {{forces that are}} better equipped and have <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> formidable air force, has for three days carried out difficult operations, the success of which is {{of the utmost importance}} to the general conduct of the battle and to the result of war.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} light and medium-calibre guns was limited, and {{accuracy}} declined badly at longer range. At longer ranges <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high rate of fire decreased; accurate shooting depended on spotting the shell-splashes of the previous salvo, which limited the optimum rate of fire.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Navy {{withdrew from the}} project. Stormfury began to refocus its efforts on understanding, rather than modifying, {{tropical}} cyclones. At the same time, the Project's aircraft were {{nearing the end of}} their operational lifetimes. At the cost of $30million (year unknown) two Lockheed P-3's were acquired. Due to the rarity of Atlantic hurricanes meeting the safety requirements, plans were made to move Stormfury to the Pacific and experiment on the large number of typhoons there. This action required many of the same safety requirements as in the Atlantic, but had <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> much higher number of potential subjects.|$|E
5|$|In the final, Australia made a poor start; Dawn Fraser almost {{stopped when}} she heard a second gunshot, believing that a false start had occurred. She {{finished}} her leg in 1 minute 4.0 seconds, two seconds slower than the world record she set in the individual 100-metre final, but with a 2.3-second lead over the United States' Sylvia Ruuska. Nevertheless, this meant that Australia had a smaller than expected advantage. Swimming the second leg, Leech maintained {{the lead in the}} first 50 metres but faded in the second half and finished with a split of 1 minute 5.1 seconds, with the Australian lead cut to 0.9 of a second. Even with <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flying start, Leech's leg was 0.4 of a second slower than her fastest time during the individual competition.|$|E
5|$|Placing {{the engines}} within the wings had <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{reduction}} {{in the risk of}} foreign object damage, which could seriously damage jet engines. The low-mounted engines and good placement of service panels also made aircraft maintenance easier to perform. However, the Comet's buried engine configuration increased its structural weight and complexity. Armour had to be placed around the engine cells to contain debris from any serious engine failures; also, placing the engines inside the wing required a more complicated wing structure.|$|E

5|$|Because {{half the}} country's surface {{consists}} of exposed rock, Norway has {{a tradition of}} building mountain cavern halls for many purposes, from tunnels via power plants to sport centers. These often double up as bomb shelters. Gjøvik Municipality opened Norway's first underground swimming pool in 1974. The idea to build an underground ice rink came from Consulting Engineer Jan A. Rygh while having dinner with Municipal Engineer Helge Simenstad in 1988, after the latter said that Gjøvik had been awarded an ice rink for the Olympics. The first drafts were made on a napkin in the restaurant. An alternative proposal for a conventional rink was also made. Among <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cavern hall was that it would not take up valuable downtown property space or interfere with the town's cityscape, yet it would be centrally located which would reduce travel costs, and there would be a stable year-round natural temperature which would reduce cooling costs.|$|E
5|$|Interdigital {{filters are}} {{another form of}} coupled-line filter. Each section of line is about λ/4 in length and is {{terminated}} in a short-circuit at one end only, the other end being left open-circuit. The end which is short-circuited alternates on each line section. This topology is straightforward to implement in planar technologies, but also particularly lends itself to a mechanical assembly of lines fixed inside a metal case. The lines can be either circular rods or rectangular bars, and interfacing to a coaxial format line is easy. As with the parallel-coupled line filter, <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mechanical arrangement that does not require insulators for support is that dielectric losses are eliminated. The spacing requirement between lines is not as stringent as in the parallel line structure; as such, higher fractional bandwidths can be achieved, and Q values as low as 1.4 are possible.|$|E
5|$|On August 18, 1918, {{incumbent}} senator Ollie M. James died. Stanley appointed George B. Martin {{to finish}} James' term, {{which was to}} expire on March 3 of the following year. James had already been nominated for re-election in 1918 by the Democratic primary, and the task of selecting the party's new nominee fell to the Democratic State Committee, which nominated Stanley. Stanley enjoyed <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> united Democratic party; J. C. W. Beckham supported Stanley for this seat so Stanley would not challenge him for his own seat when he faced re-election. The Republicans chose a relative unknown, Dr. Ben L. Bruner. Stanley was attacked for his veto of the German language bill and for his long-standing views against temperance. Though the national mood was against the Democrats, a letter of support from President Woodrow Wilson bolstered Stanley's campaign, and he defeated Bruner by more than 5,000 votes. He resigned as governor to assume the Senate seat in May 1919. As a Democrat in a mostly Republican Senate, he wielded little influence.|$|E

25|$|In summary, {{depending}} on the situation a 50% tax rate can cause {{the division of labor}} to fail even where productivity gains of up to 300% would have resulted. Even a mere 30% tax rate can negate <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 100% productivity gain.|$|E
25|$|A short-barrelled {{light machine}} gun variant was {{developed}} {{at the start of}} the Second World War.

25|$|Agesilaus came {{to power}} by {{accident}} {{at the start of}} the 4th century BC.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> DH laser is {{that the}} region where free {{electrons}} and holes exist simultaneously—the active region—is confined to the thin middle layer. This means that many more of the electron-hole pairs can contribute to amplification—not so many are {{left out in the}} poorly amplifying periphery. In addition, light is reflected from the heterojunction; hence, the light is confined to the region where the amplification takes place.|$|E

25|$|Dried hemp {{has about}} 57% {{cellulose}} (the principal ingredient in paper), compared to about 40-50% in wood. Hemp also has <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lower lignin content: hemp contains only 5-24% lignin against the 20-35% found in wood. This lignin {{must be removed}} chemically and wood requires more use of chemicals in the process. The actual production of hemp fiber in the U.S continued to decline until 1933 to around 500 tons/year. Between 1934 and 1935, the cultivation of hemp began to increase but still at a very low level and with no significant increase of paper from hemp.|$|E
25|$|On August 19, 1727, Bradley {{embarked}} upon {{a further}} {{series of observations}} using a telescope of his own erected at the Rectory, Wanstead. This instrument had <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> larger field of view {{and he was able}} to obtain precise positions of a large number of stars over the course of about twenty years. During his first two years at Wanstead, he established the existence of the phenomenon of aberration beyond all doubt, and this also enabled him to formulate a set of rules that would allow the calculation of the effect on any given star at a specified date.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficacy}} {{profile of}} lidocaine {{as a local}} anaesthetic {{is characterized by a}} rapid onset of action and intermediate duration of efficacy. Therefore, lidocaine is suitable for infiltration, block, and surface anaesthesia. Longer-acting substances such as bupivacaine are sometimes given preference for spinal and epidural anaesthesias; lidocaine, though, has <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> rapid onset of action. Adrenaline vasoconstricts arteries, reducing bleeding and also delays the resorption of lidocaine, almost doubling the duration of anaesthesia. For surface anaesthesia, several formulations can be used for endoscopies, before intubations, etc. Buffering the pH of lidocaine makes local numbing less painful. Lidocaine drops can be used on the eyes for short ophthalmic procedures.|$|E
