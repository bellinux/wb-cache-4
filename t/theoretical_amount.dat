With time, phospholipids were metabolized in triacylglycerol biosynthesis and radioactivity was detected in polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Based on the International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) that applies to ships built from 2013, RightShip's GHG Rating can also be applied to vessels built prior to 2013, allowing for effective vessel comparison across the world's fleet. The GHG Rating utilises an A to G scale, where A represents the most efficient ships. It measures the <b>theoretical</b> <b>amount</b> of carbon dioxide emitted per tonne nautical mile travelled, based on the design characteristics of the ship at time of build such as cargo carrying capacity, engine power and fuel consumption. Higher rated ships can deliver significantly lower CO2 emissions across the voyage length, which means they also use less fuel and are cheaper to run.|$|E
40|$|This article calculates the Feenstra's (1994) 'exact price index' {{for each}} {{category}} of US-imported goods and aggregates them to analyse the US import demand equation {{for assessing the}} seriousness of the external imbalance. What distinguishes Feenstra's exact price index is that it incorporates new product varieties. The exact import price index thus calculated suggests that US conventional import prices are biased upwards. The consequent downward adjustment in import prices causes appreciation in the real exchange rate and lowers the excessive portion of imports (the difference between actual and <b>theoretical</b> <b>amounts</b> of imports obtained from the import demand equation). Since the early 2000 s, however, the role that new product varieties play in lowering the excessive portion of imports has declined because the impact of new products on import prices has been outweighed by the impact of the spike in primary commodity prices, which has resulted in a substantial depreciation of the real exchange rate. It is possible that this depreciation combined with relatively large excessive imports has caused the subsequent US current account deficit to stop expansion from the late 2000 s onwards. exact import price index, import demand equation, real exchange rate, US external imbalance,...|$|R

40|$|A thermal {{analysis}} {{study of the}} hydrogen loading characteristics of nanocrystalline Mg-Ni alloys (Ni content ranging from 0. 1 at% to 10 at%) {{has been carried out}} in 3 MPa hydrogen, employing the techniques of differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The measurements confirmed the nonequilibrium state of the samples as prepared by the mechanical alloying technique. An enthalpy associated with the stabilisation of the alloys on first heating in hydrogen was found for all the samples studied. The magnitude of this enthalpy increased with the nickel content of the alloy. All the samples showed rapid uptake of hydrogen at 3 MPa pressure, indicating that the nickel was thus playing a very active role at the alloy surface in dissociating hydrogen and so enabling more rapid hydride formation by the alloy. This catalytic activity of the nickel decreased with temperature cycling over the range 80 °C to 500 °C.

Identity, strength, quality, and purity of herbal products are further compromised during manufacturing and storage. The aim of present work was to evaluate solubility {{and stability of}} curcumin, a pigment obtained from dried rhizomes of plant Cucrcuma longa. Materials and Methods: The stoichiometric ratios for inclusion complexation of curcumin with various cyclodextrins (CDs) were determined by phase solubility analysis. Grinding, kneading, and freeze-drying were employed to determine optimum complexation. Complexes were evaluated for drug inclusion, solubility, and stability. Results: Stability constants were 11200 M− 1, 1557 M− 1, 2858 M− 1, and 2206 M− 1 for α-, β-, γ-CD, and dimethyl β-CD (DIMEB), respectively, thus indicating good complex formation. <b>Theoretical</b> <b>amounts</b> of curcumin in binary products were between 80 % and 97 % with a maximum of 96. 8 % in curcumin-β-CD freeze-dried product.

The performance of Ru/MCM- 41 increased with increasing <b>theoretical</b> loading <b>amount</b> of Ru and with reduction temperature. However, when the reduction temperature reached to 500 degrees C, or the Ru <b>theoretical</b> loading <b>amount</b> increased to 15 wt%, the activity of Ru/MCM- 41 decreased reversely. Through the characterizations by small-angle XRD, wide-angle XRD, H- 2 -TPR, and SEM analysis, the reason for the deteriorated performance of Ru/MCM- 41 under high reduction temperature or high Ru loading amount was deduced as the collapse of MCM- 41 structure and severe overlaps of Ru atoms. Hydrogen donors were also tested, and formic acid was found in best performance owing to its fast decomposition rate and high productivity of hydrogen. Though an increased feed ratio of formic acid to phenol could improve the hydrodeoxygenation potential of phenol, much simultaneously generated CO. from decomposition of formic acid might occupy active sites of the catalyst and led to a decreased growth rate of phenol conversion.
