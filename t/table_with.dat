40|$|Rough {{set theory}} was {{originally}} proposed for analyzing data gathered in data tables, {{often referred to}} as information systems. The lower and upper approximations introduced within this theory are known as the very useful concepts. The theory as a whole now becomes a recognized foundation for granular computing. This paper investigates the rough set-based issues for analyzing <b>table</b> data <b>with</b> uncertainty. In reality, <b>tables</b> <b>with</b> non-deterministic information are focused on instead of <b>tables</b> <b>with</b> deterministic information, and several mathematical properties are examined. Especially, decision rule generation from <b>tables</b> <b>with</b> non-deterministic information is highlighted. This investigation is also applied to <b>tables</b> <b>with</b> uncertain numerical data. As a result, a new mathematical framework for analyzing <b>tables</b> <b>with</b> uncertain information is formalized.

5|$|Alternatively, it is {{possible}} to use a lazy deletion strategy in which a key–value pair is removed by replacing the value by a special flag value indicating a deleted key. However, these flag values will contribute to the load factor of the hash <b>table.</b> <b>With</b> this strategy, it may become necessary to clean the flag values out of the array and rehash all the remaining key–value pairs once too large a fraction of the array becomes occupied by deleted keys.|$|E
40|$|We discuss {{connecting}} <b>tables</b> <b>with</b> zero-one entries by {{a subset}} of a Markov basis. In this paper, as a Markov basis we consider the Graver basis, which corresponds to the unique minimal Markov basis for the Lawrence lifting of the original configuration. Since the Graver basis tends to be large, it is of interest to clarify conditions such that {{a subset of}} the Graver basis, in particular a minimal Markov basis itself, connects <b>tables</b> <b>with</b> zero-one entries. We give some theoretical results on the connectivity of <b>tables</b> <b>with</b> zero-one entries. We also study some common models, where a minimal Markov basis for tables without the zero-one restriction does not connect <b>tables</b> <b>with</b> zero-one entries. Comment: 18 page...|$|R

40|$|In practice, some of {{information}} systems are based on dominance relations, and values of decision attribute are fuzzy. So, it is meaningful to study attribute reductions in ordered decision <b>tables</b> <b>with</b> fuzzy decision. In this paper, upper and lower approximation reductions are proposed {{in this kind of}} complicated decision table, respectively. Some important properties are discussed. The judgement theorems and discernibility matrices associated with two reductions are obtained from which the theory of attribute reductions is provided in ordered decision <b>tables</b> <b>with</b> fuzzy decision. Moreover, rough set approach to upper and lower approximation reductions is presented in ordered decision <b>tables</b> <b>with</b> fuzzy decision as well. An example illustrates the validity of the approach, and results show that it is an efficient tool for knowledge discovery in ordered decision <b>tables</b> <b>with</b> fuzzy decision...|$|R
