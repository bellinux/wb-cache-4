5|$|Warwick's sister, and {{therefore}} Edward IV's niece, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, was executed by Henry VIII in 1541. By then, {{the cause was}} more religious and political rather than dynastic. The attainder of her father, Clarence, was a legal bar to any claims to the throne by his children. Additionally her marriage, arranged by Henry VII, to Sir Richard Pole, his half-cousin and trusted supporter, was not auspicious. Nevertheless, it did allow the couple to be closely involved in court affairs. Margaret's fortunes improved under Henry VIII and in February 1512 she was restored to the earldom of Salisbury and all the Warwicks' lands. This made her the first and, apart from Anne Boleyn, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> 16th-century England to hold a peerage title in her own right.|$|E

Riipinen was among the most radical in the IKL parliamentary group, receiving a warning for impetuosity from the party. She was supportive of the fascist regimes of Italy and Germany in her speeches, a line which was not mainstream in the IKL. She also conflicted with the IKL leadership when she led the women's section for the party, with male IKL leadership seizing a board meeting to prevent what they saw as harmful decisions.|$|E

25|$|Green is {{probably}} most noted {{for her work}} helping to develop the legislation that was to become TitleIX, now-called the Patsy T. Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act. The law prohibited sex discrimination in federally funded educational institutions. In the late 1960s, after noting that while programs existed to keep boys in school but no similar programs existed for girls, Green sought to correct this inequity. She helped to introduce a higher education bill that contained provisions regarding gender equity in education. The hearings on this bill, working together with fellow Representative Patsy Mink and Senator Birch Bayh, eventually resulted in the passage of TitleIX in 1972. In addition Green was fundamental in introducing and penning the successful Equal Pay Act of 1963 and in the following year, she was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> the House of Representatives who voted against including sex in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, {{saying that it was}} neither the time nor the place for addressing {{discrimination on the basis of}} sex in employment.|$|E
25|$|Her {{elementary}} education consisted of {{attendance at the}} local school that her parents had started. The Walkers were determined that their daughters be as well-educated as their son, so they founded the first free school house in Oswego in the late 1830s. After finishing primary school, Mary and two of her older sisters attended Falley Seminary in Fulton, New York. Falley was not only an institution of higher learning, but a place that emphasized modern social reform in gender roles, education, and hygiene. Its ideologies and practices further cemented Mary's determination to defy traditional feminine standards on a principle of injustice. In her free time, Mary would pore over her father's medical texts on anatomy and physiology; her interest in medicine is attributable to her exposure to medical literature at an early age. As a young woman, she taught at a school in Minetto, New York, eventually earning {{enough money to pay}} her way through Syracuse Medical College (now the State University of New York Upstate Medical University), where she graduated with honors as a medical doctor in 1855, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> her class.|$|E
