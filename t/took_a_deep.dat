5|$|Andronicus II <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> {{interest}} in preserving the Anatolian lands of Byzantium and ordered construction of forts in Asia Minor and vigorous {{training of the}} army. The Byzantine Emperor ordered that his court be moved to Anatolia to oversee the campaigns there and instructed his General Alexios Philanthropenos to push back the Turks. Early successes were rendered useless when Alexios staged an unsuccessful coup, leading to his blinding {{and the end of}} his campaigns. This allowed the Ottomans to lay siege to Nicaea in 1301. A further defeat on Andronicus' son Michael IX and the Byzantine general George Mouzalon occurred at Magnesia and Bapheus in 1302.|$|E

He died on 25 August 1967 at the age of 84. He was the last surviving member of Billy Hughes' Cabinet. His memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields and was widely attended, including by representatives of the Royal Family. His ashes were scattered over Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra. The Canberra suburb of Bruce, and the electoral Division of Bruce based in south-east Melbourne, were both named for him after his death.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} of not showing the ping-pong balls live has fueled {{speculation that the}} NBA will occasionally fix the draft lottery if it can benefit the league. The speculation originated with the 1985 draft lottery that sent Patrick Ewing to New York, with the theory being that the NBA wanted to send {{the best player in}} the draft to New York to increase ratings in a large television market. At that time, the NBA used 7 envelopes in a tumbler representing the seven teams with the worst record. Some have speculated that the envelope containing the Knicks logo was refrigerated beforehand, enabling David Stern to recognize and select it. Another conspiracy theory suggests that one of the seven envelopes was thrown into the tumbler, causing one of the corners to fold. After the envelopes were mixed, Stern <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath before reaching into the tumbler and picking the envelope with the folded corner. No one has ever explained why all the other teams would go along with the fix. Afterward, the Draft Lottery Format was changed to the current ping-pong ball lottery in a private room with team representatives. However, despite the lack of any evidence, conspiracy theories still persist regarding the annual outcome of the lottery.|$|E
500|$|Dick Tracy is {{also the}} first film to use digital audio. In a December 1990 {{interview}} with The New York Times, Elfman criticized the growing tendency to use digital technology for sound design and dubbing purposes. [...] "I detest contemporary scoring and dubbing in cinema. Film music as an art <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> plunge when Dolby stereo hit. Stereo {{has the capacity to}} make orchestral music sound big and beautiful and more expansive, but it also can make sound effects sound four times as big. That began the era of sound effects over music." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of the European-style vessels {{were built}} in the {{shipyard}} that Nguyễn Ánh had commissioned in Saigon. He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> personal interest in the naval program, directly supervising the work and spending several hours a day dockside. One witness noted [...] "One principal tendency of his ambition is to naval science, as a proof of this he has been heard to say he would build ships of the line on the European plan." [...] By 1792, fifteen frigates were under construction, with a design that mixed Chinese and European specifications, equipped with 14 guns. The Vietnamese learned European naval architecture by dismantling an old European vessel into its components, so that Vietnamese shipbuilders could understand the separate facets of European shipbuilding, before reassembling it. They then applied their newfound knowledge to create replicas of the boats. Nguyễn Ánh studied naval carpentry techniques and was said to be adept at it, and learned navigational theory from the French books that Pigneau translated, particularly Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert's Encyclopédie. The Saigon shipyard was widely praised by European travelers.|$|E

500|$|Off the field, the {{throwing}} controversy {{was beginning to}} affect Meckiff adversely. In his 1961 autobiography, prophetically titled Thrown Out, he said the accusations <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> personal toll on him and his family, and prompted him to shun the public. He became known by the derisive nickname [...] "Chucker" [...] and was credited on the front cover of his autobiography as [...] "Ian 'Chucker' Meckiff". Meckiff reported that from the Melbourne Test onwards, his son was verbally abused by classmates; Meckiff's parents were persistently told their son bowled illegally. He added that doctors believed his anxiety was contributing to stomach ailments. At the time, players {{were not allowed to}} talk to the media during the season, and Meckiff was upset because he could not rebut his accusers while they were free to attack him. He denied ever throwing, but admitted he may have been open to suspicion after bowling 15 to 20 overs in a day's play, as his body would begin to fall away in the delivery stride due to fatigue. He had a permanently bent bowling arm; he generated his pace from his wrist action, and asserted that his thin wrists gave the impression that his whole arm was bending.|$|E
500|$|The Armistice renewed the {{war between}} Stengel and Dreyfuss, and the outfielder held out again to begin the 1919 season. Both wanted to see Stengel traded, but no deal was {{immediately}} made. By then, Stengel's position as regular right fielder had been taken by Billy Southworth, and he had difficulty breaking back into the lineup. Stengel played better than he had before he enlisted, {{and by the time}} Dreyfuss traded him to the Philadelphia Phillies for Possum Whitted on August 9, he was batting [...]293 with four home runs. But before being traded, Stengel pulled one of his most famous stunts, on May 25 at Ebbets Field, {{as a member of the}} visiting Pirates. It was not unusual at Ebbets Field for right fielders of either team, rather than go to the dugout after three were out, to go to the Dodgers' bullpen, in foul territory down the right field line, if they were not likely to bat in the upcoming inning. Stengel did so to visit old friends, and discovered that pitcher Leon Cadore had captured a sparrow. Stengel took it, and, called to bat in the sixth inning, quietly placed it under his cap. He received mixed boos and cheers from the Brooklyn crowd as a former Dodger, <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> bow at the plate, and doffed his cap, whereupon the bird flew away to great laughter from the crowd.|$|E
2500|$|But Leavitt's {{interests}} were {{not limited to}} confections for the Gilded Age elite. He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in city planning, especially that of his adopted city of New York. On January 3, 1922, for instance, Leavitt was moved to write The New York Times concerning the routing of traffic flow, an issue addressed in a recent Times story. [...] "The construction, operating, financial and economic aspects of any problem belong to the engineer and his field", wrote Leavitt to The Times. [...] "This city is rich in her wealth of men of engineering genius and talent." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{was able}} to inspire others with his own love for the culture and people of Java, in an {{academic}} {{as well as other}} respects. He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in others who were interested in Indonesian, and particularly Javanese culture. Such as, for instance, the puppeteer from Haarlem, Rien Baartmans [...] who died far too young [...] who performed not only Dutch puppet plays but also Javanese wayang plays and was famous, especially among children, for his wonderful performances of Wayang Kancil stories about the mouse deer. And his good friend Ger van Wengen, who devoted his time as curator at the Leiden ethnological museum to popularizing ethnology, with Ger using data provided by Hans, such as his book De schending van Soebadra (The abduction of Subadra), and Hans learning from Ger.|$|E
2500|$|In The Time Ships, Stephen Baxter's {{sequel to}} The Time Machine, the Time Traveller {{encounters}} his younger self via time travel. His younger self reacts with embarrassment to his older self's {{knowledge of his}} real names: [...] "I held up my hand; I had an inspiration. [...] "No. I will use—if you will permit—Moses." [...] He <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> pull on his brandy, and gazed at me with genuine anger in his grey eyes. [...] "How {{do you know about}} that?" [...] Moses—my hated first name, for which I had been endlessly tormented at school—and which I had kept a secret since leaving home!" [...] This is a reference to H.G. Wells's story [...] "The Chronic Argonauts", the story which grew into The Time Machine, in which the inventor of the Time Machine is named Dr. Moses Nebogipfel; the surname of Wells's first inventor graces another character in Baxter's book (see above).|$|E
2500|$|While Shastri's {{family had}} no {{links to the}} {{independence}} movement then taking shape, among his teachers at Harish Chandra High School was an intensely patriotic and highly respected teacher named Nishkameshwar Prasad Mishra, who gave Shastri much-needed financial support by allowing him to tutor his children. Inspired by Mishra's patriotism, Shastri <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> interest in the freedom struggle, and began to study its history and the works of several of its noted personalities, including those of Swami Vivekananda, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Gandhi and Annie Besant. In January 1921, when Shastri was in the 10 standard and three months from sitting the final examinations, he attended a public meeting in Benares hosted by Gandhi and Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya. Inspired by the Mahatma's call for students to withdraw from government schools and join the non-cooperation movement, Shastri withdrew from Harish Chadra {{the next day and}} joined the local branch of the Congress Party as a volunteer, actively participating in picketing and anti-government demonstrations. He was soon arrested and jailed, but was then let off as he was still a minor. Shastri's immediate supervisor was a former Benares Hindu University lecturer named J.B. Kripalani, who would {{become one of the most}} prominent leaders of the Indian independence movement and among Gandhi's closest followers. Recognising the need for the younger volunteers to continue their educations, Kripalani and a friend, V.N. Sharma, had founded an informal school centered around [...] "nationalist education" [...] to educate the young activists in their nation's heritage. With the support of a wealthy philanthropist and ardent Congress nationalist, Shiv Prasad Gupta, the Kashi Vidyapith was inaugurated by Gandhi in Benares as a national institution of higher education on 10 February 1921. Among the first students of the new institution, Shastri graduated with a first-class degree in philosophy and ethics from the Vidyapith in 1925. He was given the title Shastri ("scholar"). The title was a bachelor's degree awarded by the Vidyapith, but it stuck as part of his name.|$|E
