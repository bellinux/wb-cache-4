2500|$|A {{wide range}} of {{instrumentation}} is used by electrical engineers. [...] For simple control circuits and alarms, a basic multimeter measuring voltage, current, and resistance may suffice. [...] Where time-varying signals need to be studied, the oscilloscope is also an ubiquitous instrument. [...] In RF engineering and high frequency telecommunications, spectrum analyzers and network analyzers are used. [...] In some disciplines, safety can be a particular concern with instrumentation. [...] For instance, medical electronics designers {{must take into account}} that much lower voltages than normal can be dangerous when electrodes are directly in contact with internal body fluids. Power transmission engineering also has great safety concerns due to the high voltages used; although voltmeters may in principle be similar to their low voltage equivalents, safety and calibration issues make them very different. [...] Many disciplines of electrical engineering use tests specific to their discipline. [...] Audio electronics engineers use audio <b>test</b> <b>sets</b> consisting of a signal generator and a meter, principally to measure level but also other parameters such as harmonic distortion and noise. [...] Likewise, information technology have their own <b>test</b> <b>sets,</b> often specific to a particular data format, and {{the same is true of}} television broadcasting.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new static <b>test</b> <b>set</b> {{compaction}} method {{based on a}} careful examination of attributes of fault coverage curves. Our method is based on two key ideas: (1) fault-list and testset partitioning, and (2) vector re-ordering. Typically, the first few vectors of a <b>test</b> <b>set</b> detect {{a large number of}} faults. The remaining vectors usually constitute a large fraction of the <b>test</b> <b>set,</b> but these vectors are included to detect relatively few hard faults. We show that significant compaction can be achieved by partitioning faults into hard and easy faults. This significantly reduces the computational cost for static <b>test</b> <b>set</b> compaction without affecting quality of compaction. The second technique re-orders vectors in a <b>test</b> <b>set</b> by moving sequences that detect hard faults {{to the beginning of the}} <b>test</b> <b>set.</b> Fault simulation of the newly concatenated re-ordered <b>test</b> <b>set</b> results in the omission of several vectors so that the compact <b>test</b> <b>set</b> is smaller than the original <b>test</b> <b>set.</b> Experiments on sev [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|Some {{combined}} {{main burner}} and pilot gas valves (mainly by Honeywell) reduce the power demand to {{within the range}} of a single universal thermocouple heated by a pilot (25 mV open circuit falling by half with the coil connected to a 10–12 mV, 0.2–0.25 A source, typically) by sizing the coil to be able to hold the valve open against a light spring, but only after the initial turning-on force is provided by the user pressing and holding a knob to compress the spring during lighting of the pilot. These systems are identifiable by the [...] "press and hold for x minutes" [...] in the pilot lighting instructions. (The holding current requirement of such a valve is much less than a bigger solenoid designed for pulling the valve in from a closed position would require.) Special <b>test</b> <b>sets</b> are made to confirm the valve let-go and holding currents, because an ordinary milliammeter cannot be used as it introduces more resistance than the gas valve coil. Apart from testing the open circuit voltage of the thermocouple, and the near short-circuit DC continuity through the thermocouple gas valve coil, the easiest non-specialist test is substitution of a known good gas valve.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{testable}} EXOR-Sum-of-Products (ESOP) circuit realization and a simple, universal <b>test</b> <b>set</b> which detects all single stuck-at faults in {{the internal}} lines and the primary inputs/outputs of the realization are given. Since ESOP is the most general form of AND-EXOR representations, our realization and <b>test</b> <b>set</b> are more versatile than those described by other researchers for the restricted GRM, FPRM, and PPRM forms of AND-EXOR circuits. Our circuit realization requires only two extra inputs for controllability and one extra output for observability. The cardinality of our <b>test</b> <b>set</b> for an input circuit is (+ 6). For Built-in Self Test (BIST) applications, we show that our <b>test</b> <b>set</b> can be generated internally as easily as a pseudo-random pattern, and that it provides 100 % single stuck-at fault coverage. In addition, our <b>test</b> <b>set</b> requires a much shorter test cycle than a comparable pseudo-exhaustive or pseudo-random <b>test</b> <b>set.</b> Index Terms—Universal <b>test</b> <b>set,</b> AND-EXOR realizations, Reed-Muller expressions, single stuck-at fault model, easily testable combinational networks, Design for Testing (DFT), self testable circuits, Built-in Self Test (BIST), test pattern generation. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{fundamental}} idea of test of mismatch is to deterministically test analog circuits {{for the presence}} of mismatch. We introduce a tool named ATOM, which delivers a compact and lowcost <b>test</b> <b>set</b> that is specialized in deterministically deciding whether a circuit has mismatch or not. This mismatch specialized <b>test</b> <b>set</b> will potentially help reduce the superfluous and time consuming functional <b>test</b> vector <b>sets</b> that have been previously used for testing analog circuits. ATOM enforces a separation between design and test of circuits to account for IP protection and production burst, as the circuit netlist can be hidden from the test engineer and the circuit designer need not be involved in the generation of the <b>test</b> <b>set.</b> The <b>test</b> <b>set</b> generation using ATOM is quite fast and does not necessitate a detailed analysis of the circuit. A mismatch factor is introduced so as to measure the degree of mismatch a circuit configuration has, and is used in the determination of the <b>test</b> <b>set.</b> Proper <b>testing</b> of mismatch will decrease test time and cost. The <b>test</b> <b>set</b> created by ATOM efficiently detects mismatch in high-end analog circuits. ATOM is a general test of mismatch tool and can be used with a broad range of circuits. I...|$|R
