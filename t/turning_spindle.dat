40|$|Abstract: An {{abrasive}} {{water jet}} micro-turning experiment device {{is designed to}} solve the problem for micromachining the revolving parts. This device is composed of the machine body, hydraulic system, collection devices and control equipment etc. This paper emphasizes on the structure design of the moving parts of the abrasive water jet turning process, clamp, lathe bed, abrasive water jet injecting system and collection system. The <b>turning</b> <b>spindle</b> system and feed drive mechanism are designed, and the strength, stiffness and precision of the ball screw transmission mechanism are calculated and checked {{to meet the needs of}} the abrasive water jet micro-turning experiments. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Titanium alloys, as difficult-to-cut materials, have poor {{machinability}} due {{to their}} superior mechanical properties, heat resistance and corrosion resistance. High cutting temperature and great cutting force that will greatly accelerate tool wear often occurs in titanium alloys cutting process. In this paper, an ultrasonic vibration turning method was used to lower diamond tool wear during TC 4 titanium alloy turning process. Ultrasonic vibration turning tests were carried out with various cutting parameters. Experimental results indicated that there’s a significant reduction of the wear rate of diamond tools by means of ultrasonic vibration in TC 4 turning process. For ultrasonic vibration <b>turning,</b> <b>spindle</b> speed, the amplitude and frequency of vibration of the tool are the greatest impact of tool wear, followed by feed rate, then the cutting depth. 1...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} a novel EDM turning process specially designed and developed to generate precise cylindrical forms on hard and difficult-to-machine materials. For this purpose, {{a specially designed}} <b>turning</b> <b>spindle</b> is used. The spindle was mounted on a conventional die-sinking EDM machine to rotate the workpiece. Axially symmetric parts can be manufactured by feeding the shaped tool into the rotating workpiece. In this way an axisymmetric workpiece {{can be made with}} small tools at both macro and micro levels. Effects of machining parameters, such as the current, pulse-on time, rotational speed, flushing pressure, and duty factor, on the surface roughness of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy in electrical discharge turning were investigated. Taguchi 2 ̆ 7 s design of experiment technique was used. Analysis of variance and regression analysis were performed on experimental data. The signal-to-noise ratio analysis was employed to find the optimal condition...|$|E

30|$|According to Eq. (24), {{the feeding}} per tooth f is {{inversely}} proportional to the <b>spindle</b> <b>turning</b> speed n, thus the cutting forces decrease {{with the increase of}} <b>spindle</b> <b>turning</b> speed n. On the other hand, the cutting velocity v increases with <b>spindle</b> <b>turning</b> speed n, which can in turn increase the shear strain rate γ̇ of shear zone (Eq. (16)). According to the quasi-solid–liquid transition constitutive equation of sand mould cutting (Eq. (23)), the stress in the shear zone will increase the cutting forces. Based on a comprehensive consideration of the above two factors, the cutting forces, therefore, decrease with the increase of <b>spindle</b> <b>turning</b> speed n but disproportionately, as Figure  10 (c) shows.|$|R
