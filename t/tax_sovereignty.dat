In 1326 it became part of Baden, as a fief to the Hofwart family of Kirchheim. The suzerainty probably comes from the Counts of Eberstein and thus of the Kraichgau knights. The fiefdom converted to protestantism in 1530. After reversion of the feud in 1675 Margrave Frederick of Baden gave Münzesheim to his two illegitimate sons, which styled themselves Barons of Münzesheim. Friedrich August of Münzesheim sold the community in 1761 back to the feudal lord, but Baden had to recognize the <b>tax</b> <b>sovereignty</b> of the Kraichgauer knighthood until 1805.

40|$|Tax {{competition}} between <b>tax</b> <b>sovereignties</b> is a fact. We focus {{here on the}} international tax competition. Taxation {{is one of the}} tools of governance that States use to direct their policies. Tax authorities try to diminish the burden of their taxpayers to improve the national economic and social welfare. To aim this objective, Governments intensify the competitiveness of the domestic trade and/or attract foreign investments. Because every States share the same goal, Governments compete with each other on the tax field. This tax competition is qualified as beneficial on the one hand, and one the other hand [...] -ever more often [...] -the adjective used to qualify this competition would be "harmful".

It stands out the concern {{of one of the}} freedoms of the block, the free circulation of goods and services. The sovereignty of the State lodges the fiscal <b>sovereignty</b> or <b>tax.</b> In international scope, the fiscal <b>sovereignty</b> or <b>tax</b> is reflected as full capacity of a State ahead of excessively in the international scene. The State has fiscal sovereignty when it edits its laws, when its will is the last one to prevail how much to managed it's, and the fiscal sovereignty exceeds the territory of the State, when its ability tax reaches its contributors where it wants that they are. The applicability of the constant norms in International Treatys elapses the postulate of sovereignty, as concern the juridical power, which its concept discloses a supremacy character, distinguishing itself from the sovereignty of the State directed to all of its territory and in the reciprocal relations between the States. After that, treaty and the tax treaty are analysed more deeply. Such implications reflect in Brazil’s Reformation Tax and the adjustments assumed by MERCOSUR’s members. O presente estudo tem o objetivo de analisar o conceito de soberania, da existência ou não da soberania tributária no Brasil e suas implicações com o pacto federativo e competências tributárias face ao MERCOSUL. Ressalta a preocupação de uma das liberdades do bloco, a livre circulação de bens e de serviços. A soberania do Estado alberga a soberania fiscal ou tributária. Em âmbito internacional, a soberania fiscal ou tributária reflete-se como capacidade plena de um Estado diante dos demais no cenário internacional. O Estado tem soberania fiscal quando edita suas leis, quando a sua vontade é a última a prevalecer quanto aos seus administrados, e a soberania fiscal ultrapassa o território do Estado, quando sua competência tributária alcança seus contribuintes onde quer que eles estejam. A aplicabilidade das normas constantes nos tratados decorre do postulado da soberania, como abordou-se acima, cujo conceito revela um caráter de supremacia, concernente ao poder jurídico, distinguindo-se da soberania do Estado dirigida a todos de seu território e nas relações recíprocas entre os Estados.

Despite the associated increase of cross-border externalities (mainly environmental damage), no recourse is being taken to taxation at the European level as a steering instrument.

This holds, in particular, for expenditure for research, education and the transport infrastructure, which is subject to decisions taken at the European level. With a view to fiscal equivalence, it would be appropriate also to collect the taxes required to finance such expenditure at the European level.

40|$|International tax law {{forms in}} an {{increasingly}} globalized world a significant regulator applying to constantly expanding group of entities whose activities are not exclusively tied {{to the area of}} one country. On the contrary, due to the continuously increasing link between national economies these entities very often simultaneously operate across multiple territories which often results to not always clearly identifiable tax law implications. It may be noted that international cooperation between states got over long decades to the fairly high level, especially in terms of prevention of the negative effects of double taxation of income to the subject to income tax. These negative effects were seen, and indeed even today sometimes may be seen in the form of increased tax burden of tax subjects, which is related to unwillingness to cross-border activity. Also especially developed countries very often aim to support such cross-border activities due to a positive impact into their public budgets. On the other hand, it is still possible to see certain gaps which, if used appropriate by the tax entities open the way to circumvention of rules and general principles on which international cooperation on these issues is based.

This concept of selectivity features prominently {{in a number}} of recent cases and plays a controversial role in Commission and Court practice in the application of art. 107 (1) to seemingly general schemes. In this recent appeal from a judgment of the General Court, the highest EU Court examined the Netherlands scheme for NOx emissions trading from a State aid perspective and, notably, the selectivity criterion. The ECJ found for the Commission on the ground that the measure was selective because only the largest polluters had been granted (tradable, and hence valuable) emission rights free of charge. However the largest polluters were also the only ones caught by the scheme {{and it would have been}} impossible to determine the value of the rights up-front in a dynamic cap scheme. The approach chosen by the Court casts doubt on the ability of Member States to design national schemes that avoid the State aid rules even if they are in line with EU environmental policy.

This Article offers {{an explanation for the}} ECJ 2 ̆ 7 s difficulties in tax cases. 2 ̆ 2 Overlapping taxation 2 ̆ 2 —the simultaneous exercise of tax jurisdiction by two states in cross-border tax cases—tends to create real, but nondiscriminatory, cross-border tax disadvantages that the ECJ may mistake for discrimination.

40|$|Abstract: At the {{beginning}} of the XXI century the dynamic development of the processes of internationalization of economic life has overcome entire countries and regions of the world and results in the investigation of rapprochement and convergence of the national tax systems. As world experience testifies, the modern tax systems that were formed in different countries of the world have become the result of difficult co-operation of economical, political and sociological factors. But {{at the same time the}} obvious differences of the mentioned factors create the necessity in the development and introduction of compatible mechanisms of the fiscal adjusting, that will deepen the international investment co-operation. That’s why it should be noticed that without the maintenance of formal <b>tax</b> <b>sovereignty</b> of all the countries of the world as a subject of international economic relations, co-ordination of tax policy, that was started in the middle of the XIX century, it is impossible to develop global economics in future. The purpose of this article is the analyses of the types of the national tax systems in the conditions of globalization, their description and determination. In this connection it should be noted that the processes of harmonization of the tax systems purchased the strongest embodiment within the limits of regional integration, where the level of economic co-operation and interdependence of countries is the biggest, and consequently the subsequent development of regional integration becomes impossible without intergovernmental convergence of the tax systems of countries...|$|E
40|$|Cloud {{computing}} has fundamentally changed how companies operate. Companies have quickly {{adapted by}} moving their businesses to the cloud, but international tax standards {{have failed to}} follow suit. As a result, taxpayers and tax administrations confront significant tax challenges in applying outdated tax principles to this new environment. One particular area that raises perplexing tax issues is the transfer pricing rules. The transfer pricing rules set forth the intercompany price a cloud service provider must charge an affiliate using its cloud services, which ultimately affects {{the determination of the}} jurisdiction in which the company’s profits are taxed. This Article argues that, {{due to the nature of}} the cloud, the current transfer pricing rules give U. S. multinational enterprises substantial freedom to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions and avoid tax in the United States in a practice commonly referred to as base erosion and profit shifting, or “BEPS. ” This type of aggressive international tax planning has become a pressing problem worldwide that poses a serious risk to <b>tax</b> <b>sovereignty,</b> tax fairness, and the integrity of the corporate income tax. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) launched an action plan to address the BEPS problem, but the OECD’s work falls short of coming up with an innovative solution that will minimize the artificial shifting of profits abroad. In response, this Article recommends that, given the features of this new business environment, an international tax reform solution that adopts formulary apportionment or the profit-split methodology on a coordinated global basis would better address BEPS and minimize the undesirable policy results of our current transfer pricing rules...|$|E
40|$|Value added tax {{has been}} applied for four decades now and as a novelty it has already worn off both in theory and practice. It has indisputable {{advantages}} and relatively minor shortcomings compared {{to other forms of}} consumption taxation. Today {{it is one of the}} most widely used form of consumption tax in the world, being levied in about 120 countries accounting for around 70 per cent of the world population, including all European countries except Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina (the Federation and the Republic of Srpska). The burden of value added tax is visible at each stage in the production and distribution chain, thus eliminating taxation accumulation and is borne ultimately by the final consumer of final goods and services in the consuming country. The consumption type is a dominant type of value added tax. It ensures that the fixed and current assets purchases are exempt from VAT, and as such, it encourages technological progress and investment. By applying the country of destination principle (VAT is chargeable in the country where the goods or services are consumed - exports are exempt from tax while imports are taxed), value added tax eliminates double taxation and retains <b>tax</b> <b>sovereignty</b> of the importing country. In the last ten years there have been attempts to introduce value added tax in Serbia. The introduction of value added tax is the condition for the accession to the EU and we should expect that the latest attempt to introduce this tax in the Serbia taxation system will be successful. Namely, VAT Act is expected to be passed during 2004 and enforced as of January 1, 2005...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the central}} issues in {{comparative}} law and political economy is whether the forces of globalization {{will result in the}} convergence of public policies across countries. Noting in particular that taxes collected still cover a considerable range across industrialized countries -from a low of 20 % of GDP to a high of 50 % - some have argued that globalization has not resulted in a loss of <b>tax</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> However following a review of the evidence, in this Article we conclude that globalization has had significant but subtle effects on tax levels and structures. Moreover these pressures will make it increasingly difficult for countries to raise revenue to finance new public needs and to structure their tax systems in order to achieve a more socially acceptable distribution of income than what market forces dictate. Tax levels in most countries have remained essentially flat over the past twenty years, but there is a host of reasons for thinking they would have continued to rise {{were it not for the}} pressures of globalization. Statutory corporate tax rates have declined dramatically and, although corporate tax revenues have remained robust, this has been due to factors unrelated to deliberate tax policy choices. Personal marginal tax rates have also declined sharply and tax revenues have been increasingly raised by regressive consumption taxes. These trends stem from tax competition brought on by the forces of globalization, not from changing ideas or other political variables. In this Article we conclude that in order to prevent tax competition from completely eroding the ability of countries to fashion their own tax systems, there will have to be considerable cooperation among the major countries and some harmonization of aspects of their tax systems, particularly as they apply to footloose factors of production...|$|E
40|$|According to the OECD, "base erosion {{constitutes}} a serious risk to tax revenues, <b>tax</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and tax fairness for OECD members countries and non-members alike a significant cause of base erosion is profit shifting". Although {{there has been}} discontent with the existing framework for many years, considerable impetus {{has been given to}} the OECD BEPS project by the G 8 and the G 20. OECD rhetoric includes statements such as "BEPS offers a global roadmap that will allow governments to collect the tax revenue they need to serve their citizens. It also gives businesses the certainty they need to invest and grow", and that this is a "once in a century" opportunity to reform the international tax system. It is clear that the OECD intends to propose evolutionary, rather than revolutionary, reforms. But {{it is not at all}} clear that such an approach will generate an international tax system fit for the 21 st century. It is not only the practical working of the system that is in doubt, but its conceptual basis. A lack of a good conceptual basis means that reforms may be piecemeal and arbitrary. This talk addressed fundamental issues of principle and practice in the allocation of profits for taxation. It questioned the conceptual basis of the existing OECD framework, discussed the BEPS action plan, and considered other potential methods of allocating taxing rights between countries, including methods based on residence, destination and formula apportionment. This lecture was organised by the ESRC Centre for the Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at IFS and the Chartered Institute of Taxation (CIOT) and was designed to promote serious debate among policy-makers, opinion-formers and the wider tax and economic communities. Stephen Coleclough, CIOT, opened the event. Following the lecture, there was a panel debate with Paul Johnson, IFS (chair), Bill Dodwell, Deloitte, and Nicholas MacPherson, Permanent Secretary, HM Treasury...|$|E
40|$|The {{problems}} {{analyzed in}} the article are new to the domestic financial and tax research due to their emergent character. The article considers the influence of geopolitical factors on the tax policy of the Russian Federation and marks the most visible implemented or prospective changes in the Russian tax system {{under the influence of}} the facts and circumstances related to the geopolitical component of modern development. The focus is made on the three factors of geopolitical nature, the influence of which on public finances and taxes of Russia has already been or may be the most noticeable in the future. These factors include the growth of military spending on the backdrop of escalating tensions in the political relations between Russia and Western countries; the exchange of trade and economic sanctions between Russia and Western countries; the pursuit of enhanced <b>tax</b> <b>sovereignty</b> of the regions in the framework of the current centralized model of fiscal federalism. The possible consequences of the policy of sanctions imposed as the result of the new round of geopolitical confrontation between Russia and Western countries are analyzed. Among these consequences we should name the use of tax incentives to compensate the losses of exporters; the use of tax regulators at the financial market; the search for new sources of tax revenues for regional budgets; anti-offshore policy in relation to the Russian tax residents; the limitation of the benefits of using the consolidated groups of taxpayers; the possibility of creating a special (free) economic zone in Crimea with the regime of preferential taxation. It is proved that the manifestation of geopolitics requires the serious understanding of its consequences in all spheres, including the system of public finances and taxes...|$|E
40|$|The {{establishment}} of the European Union (EU) has had {{a huge impact on}} Europe which has become a substantially different place as compared to {{what it used to be}} in some earlier times. In the field of taxation, the EU Member States are generally required to fully implement of the process of tax harmonization. In fiscal terms, harmonization implies the coordination of particular taxes, tax structures and tax policies among states. As the primary objective of the EU is to establish the common market, to prevent distortion and to eliminate obstacles hindering the free movement of goods, services, capital and people, the first step towards accomplishing these goals has been the harmonization of indirect taxes: the Value Added Tax and (partly) excises. The results have been much more inconspicuous in the harmonization of direct taxes: the personal-income tax, the corporate tax, and property taxes. The harmonization of direct taxes in the EU is still a current issue, particularly in view of the unfair tax competition and the need to strengthen and promote the development of the European common market. However, in reality, EU Member States consistently keep protecting their <b>tax</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and putting off the full harmonization of their legislation on direct taxes for some other time. In the contemporary circumstances, the activities which deserve undivided attention are the efforts aimed at improving tax cooperation between EU Member States and their tax administrations. In this paper, the author analyses the characteristics of tax harmonization and tax competition. Further on, the author discusses the arguments for and against tax harmonization, as well as the pros and cons of tax competition. Bearing in mind the current state of affairs, the evident problems in the field of tax harmonization at the EU level and the willingness of Member States to improve their tax cooperation, the author suggests possible directions for the development of national tax systems of the EU Member States in the future...|$|E
40|$|The {{power to}} tax enables a State to organise its tax law {{on the basis of}} its {{national}} standards with respect to economic effectiveness and equity.   Taxes are a decisive financial factor for the governmental expenditure, the regulation of business, the promotion of the public goods and the competition between States.   The revenue of taxes can represent a method of income and wealth distribution, a social control by increasing taxes on products regarded as harmful such as tobacco and alcohol, and pollution can be limited by tax concessions.   <b>Tax</b> <b>sovereignty</b> is therefore one of the most sensitive issues for the member States and its transfer considered an undesirable diminution in national sovereignty. Improvements in communication and transport are creating new opportunities but also posing complex challenges for tax systems (e. g. the sale of goods and services via the Internet has noticeably increased in recent years).   In the light of the increasing globalisation, States are forced to create a favourable environment for the investments of international enterprises.   Thus, States try to prevent a shift of economic activities from home to abroad and at the same time to attract investments of foreign enterprises.   This competition is generally acceptable since it avoids a spiralling increase of taxes, provides better State performance and public structures, unless it does not turn into harmful tax competition. Member States are required to eliminate tax obstacles for private individuals and businesses, which wish to work and operate freely within the Single Market since the defences in national tax systems have become increasingly evident and have a growing influence on economic decisions of individuals and enterprises. In addition to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice with regard to the provisos of the EC Treaty, in particular the fundamental freedoms, the Commission has aimed at harmonising or co-ordinating the Member States tax system within the field of indirect as well as direct taxation with varying degrees of success.   This has mainly been caused by the reluctance of the Member States to agree to the measures demanded by the Commission. This processor will become even more difficult in face of the European Union’s fifth and biggest enlargement with ten new Member States on 1 May 2004.   However, the European Union has the chance to lay down the fundamental provisions towards a “European Tax System” in the European Constitution.   Agreement not only upon these important issues has still not been reached.

40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe OECD {{made certain}} {{recommendations}} in its 2014 discussion draft, "Neutralising the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements", comprising recommendations on domestic law and double tax convention measures. This dissertation assesses the potential implication of these recommendations for South Africa's tax laws and double tax conventions as these relate to cross border financing arrangements between two taxpayers using hybrid instruments or hybrid entities. These hybrid entities and mismatches and which {{give rise to}} mismatch outcomes either through a deduction arising in either jurisdictions or a deduction arising in one jurisdiction without an inclusion in income in the other jurisdiction. This assessment is made to understand how these recommendations could impact on South Africa's tax laws and double tax conventions. This impact is assessed by determining the publically expressed sentiment of the South African government towards the OECD's base erosion and profit shifting proposals and thereafter by assessing how the above noted recommendations may interact with the Income Tax Act and South Africa's double tax conventions to address mismatches {{within the scope of}} this dissertation. This interactions is assessed by: reviewing the treatment of cross border hybrid instrument and hybrid entity arrangements in the Income Tax Act, the withholding tax measures in the Income Tax Act, the treatment of these arrangements in double tax conventions concluded by South Africa, and the interaction of the recommendations in the above OECD report with the Income Tax Act and double tax conventions concluded by South Africa. Conclusions are then drawn from this analysis. The review of publically expressed sentiments of the South African government evidenced support for the OECD's base erosion and profit shifting proposals but also a sensitivity to South Africa's <b>tax</b> <b>sovereignty.</b> The review of the treatment in the Income Tax Act of the arrangements within the scope of this dissertation found that at times the Income Tax Act potentially did not resolve the mismatches of concern and that withholding tax may not have the potential to comprehensively preserve the tax base against these arrangements, particularly taking into account the influence of double tax conventions. The review of the recommendations in the above OECD report found that these recommendations could assist existing domestic tax law measures in addressing the mismatch outcomes of concern, albeit not necessarily comprehensively and potentially at the cost of added complexity. It was also found that the double tax convention recommendations appeared to have limited impact to clarifying and confirming the existing treatment of arrangements involving hybrid entities. These findings are significant as they indicate a support for the OECD's recommendations by the South African government and that the recommendations could assist in addressing the mismatch outcomes addressed in this dissertation...|$|E
40|$|Professions {{possess a}} service ideal {{orientation}} (Dillard 2008; Starr 1982; Toren 1975) and {{play an important}} role in the 'pursuit of public interest and the common good’ (Jennings et al. 1987, 3). This incorporates ‘serving the public’ or ‘protecting the public interest’ (Pierce 2007, 7). While there is no agreement on what the ‘public interest’ means or how to measure it (Baker 2005; Boseman 2007; Canning and O’Dwyer 2001; Dellaportas and Davenport 2008; Sikka et al. 1989), salient suggestions include ‘the collective well-bring of the community of people and institutions the profession serves’ (Institute of Certified Public Accountants 2014) and ‘the net benefits derived for…all society’ (International Federation of Accountants (IFAC 2012, 1). However, in practice, professionals have contractual obligations to serve their clients. Several studies assert that earning potential in relation to technical expertise has established the ‘servicing of the client [as] the primary duty’ (Doyle et al. 2009, 188), and has placed profession’s ethical duties as a secondary consideration (Doyle 2015; Doyle et al. 2009; Shafer and Simmons 2008; Stuebs and Wilkinson 2010, 2014). Accordingly, practices ‘may foster a reduction in the level of ethical behaviour as advisers strive to obtain and retain clients’ (Doyle et al. 2009, 182). This illustrates the difficulty of being a professional with explicit covenant to 2 serve the public interest in situations where there are considerable economic incentives to prioritise economic private interests (Canning and O’ Dwyer 2001; Carrington et al. 2013; Parker 1994; Spence and Carter 2014; Suddaby et al. 2009). Taxation is a vital resource for governments to achieve their public service agenda (ActionAid 2011; HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) 2015; Isbister 1968) and is perceived as a significant cost by corporations (Freedman et al. 2009; Shafer and Simmons 2008; Sikka 2010). Tax avoidance and its adverse impact on public interest have come into sharp focus in recent years (Christensen and Murphy 2004; Dowling 2014; Freedman et al. 2009; Hasseldine and Morris 2013; Payne and Raiborn 2015). It erodes tax bases globally, leading to serious threats to tax revenues, <b>tax</b> <b>sovereignty</b> and tax fairness (OECD 2013) and reduces overall revenue intake for governments which could be used to facilitate public services and thereby promote the public interest (Keightley and Sherlock 2012). Fiscal pressures world-wide have directed attention to billions of euro of tax avoided annually by multinationals such as Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook and Starbucks, and media reports in the United Kingdom (UK) have focused predominantly on the immorality of their actions (Independent 2016 b; The Telegraph 2012). This has been reinforced by regulatory and political commentary which is similarly critical of certain tax arrangements (OECD 2008, 2013; The Financial Times 2016; The Guardian 2017; UK Committee of Public Accounts (UK PAC) 2013). Historically, the focus of attention has been on users of these tax avoidance schemes; however recent reports have highlighted a number of notable criticisms of the role of tax professionals (Financial Reporting Council (FRC) 2013 a, 2015 a; OECD 2008; UK PAC 2013; US Senate Permanent Subcommittee of Investigations 2003). Stakeholder theory is one of several theories proposed by Frecknall-Hughes and Kirchler (2015) to examine tax practices and the tax profession. We adopt this theory by reviewing key UK stakeholder expectations in relation to public interest. Given the expansiveness of the term ‘public interest’, we have selected to analyse the public interest dimension of tax avoidance. The paper applies the stakeholder framework introduced by Mitchell et al (1997), focusing on identification and salience of stakeholders with reference to power, urgency and legitimacy. We examine the high profile UK case of MG Rover (MGR). The MGR case was selected as it was the first ruling whereby the FRC, the independent regulator for the accounting profession in the UK, criticised the profession for failing to provide clarity with regard to acting in the 3 public interest. The case highlights differing views with regard to the profession’s duty of care and public interest duty. It presses the profession to address this ambiguity. Taking some issues raised in the case and examining expectations of other key stakeholders, we review codes of conduct and guidance documents within the UK tax profession and Big Four professional firms to understand how stakeholders’ concerns regarding tax avoidance and the public interest are addressed by the profession. The paper is based on documentary research. Documents analysed include the FRC tribunal and appeal report on Deloitte and Touche (Deloitte) in respect of the MGR case, the Department for Business Innovation and Skills report on MGR, the UK tax profession and the Big Four firms’ codes of conduct, tax principles and guidance documents, UK PAC reports and media reports. For context, we also refer to newspaper articles, pertinent regulation and regulatory rulings, sourced from newspaper archives and pertinent webpages. Findings highlight heightened awareness of stakeholder perspectives within the UK tax profession and significant progress in responding to public interest responsibilities. The paper reports a shift in focus whereby the stakeholder concept is increasingly embedded within professional guidance. Mitchell et al. ’s (1997) stakeholder salience model is used to identify influential stakeholders and analyse the pressures applied by them. The use of this model as a lens to interpret the tax profession’s response to public interest, in respect of the tax avoidance issue, is a key contribution. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 details literature regarding the role of the tax profession, tax avoidance and its ethical dimension. Section 3 reviews the theoretical framing, namely stakeholder theory. Section 4 analyses the MGR case. Section 5 examines codes of conduct and key principles of professional tax bodies and large professional firms. Finally, Section 6 discusses the profession’s response and reports conclusions...|$|E
