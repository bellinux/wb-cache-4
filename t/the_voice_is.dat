The series employs a panel of four coaches who critique the artists' performances. Each coach guides their team of selected artists through the remainder of the season. They also compete to ensure that their act wins the competition, thus making them the winning coach.|$|E
5|$|The playable protagonists in {{the game}} are Mario and Luigi, whose quest is to rescue the voice of Princess Peach, the princess of the Mushroom Kingdom. <b>The</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> stolen by the game's antagonists Cackletta and Fawful. Throughout the game, Mario and Luigi must work with the Beanbean monarchy headed by Queen Bean. Both she and her son, Prince Peasley, offer Mario and Luigi assistance. The {{youthful}} Prince Peasley is a celebrity figure in his native Beanbean Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>is</b> an American singing {{competition}} {{television series}} which premiered on NBC on April 26, 2011. Based {{on the original}} The Voice of Holland, the series features several stages of competition to search for new vocal talent contested by aspiring singers, age 15 or over, drawn from public auditions. The show has four coaches who choose their favourite artists during the audition rounds, and guide their selected teams through {{the remainder of the}} season. The winner is subsequently determined by television viewers; the prizes include $100,000 and a record deal with Universal Music Group. The Voice has been very successful since its premiere, drawing high ratings for the network and becoming one of the highest-rated shows in the country.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>was</b> finally updated {{to offset}} presses in November 1964. At {{some point in}} time, <b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>was</b> scaled down to a tabloid. It was {{switched}} back to a full-size, eight column paper in August 1972.|$|R
50|$|After <b>The</b> Village <b>Voice</b> <b>was</b> {{acquired}} by New Times Media in 2005, the publication's key personnel changed. <b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>was</b> then managed by two journalists from Phoenix, Arizona.|$|R

5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} communicates by auditory {{and visual}} displays. <b>The</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> generally noisy with several calls; loudest and most frequent is a wailing wy-lah, which is uttered by both sexes and often heard before the birds themselves are seen. There is usually an interval of 0.4 {{seconds before the}} call is repeated. This call is made by birds in flight, before taking off and returning to the nest. Carnaby's black cockatoos {{that are not in}} flight may answer with this call when they hear it. The call is often shortened or chopped off three-quarters of the way through as the bird takes off. The call varies between individual Carnaby's black cockatoos, and older nestlings can distinguish their parents' calls. Saunders labelled a variant of the wy-lah as the interrogative call—it is drawn out and ends with an inflection. Birds often utter a soft chuck call when alone. Females make a whistling call composed of two notes of varying volume when perched or about to take off. They also utter a softer version that is 0.6 seconds long, as well as a long single-noted whistle when alone. The male makes a soft shot wy-lah call in similar situations. Birds may also make a harsh screeching alarm call when they notice something is out of place. They squawk loudly in disputes with their own kind, when other animals enter breeding territory, or when they are handled by people in captivity. Males can utter a harsh chattering squeak when arguing with other males.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>is</b> useless against targets who cannot {{hear the}} speaker; both Baron Harkonnen in Dune and House Corrino in Children of Dune employ deaf people to guard Jessica, {{knowing that she}} cannot control them via the Voice. Being a {{manipulation}} of the target's subconscious mind, <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>is</b> of limited utility against an extremely disciplined mind, such as a Reverend Mother or a strong Mentat; if the target understands what <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>is</b> and how it works, and is aware that it is being used, he may resist it. One trained {{in the use of}} the Voice may easily detect its use by others, even subtly. In Dune Messiah, Paul trains some guards to resist the Voice so that he may imprison Bene Gesserit. By the time of Children of Dune, Gurney Halleck has also been trained by Jessica to resist the Voice completely.|$|E
25|$|The prequel Dune: The Battle of Corrin {{establishes}} {{that the}} first Bene Gesserit to use <b>the</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>is</b> Raquella Berto-Anirul, {{the founder of the}} order.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>voices</b> <b>were</b> {{provided}} by British and American impressionists including: ...|$|R
60|$|A {{burst of}} ironical {{laughter}} followed. <b>The</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> Uncle Ben's.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>was</b> a Norwegian {{radio station}} with a rhythmic CHR format.|$|R
25|$|A barker, kept {{anonymous}} {{until the}} very end, is heard in the closing moments of the film. <b>The</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> finally revealed {{to be that of}} Edmond O'Brien.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> a loud {{drawn-out}} and ascending honking aang. As {{a warning}} call, a similar but more barking honk is given {{two or three}} times in short succession.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday, 26 September 2010, the PRIDE {{system was}} {{upgraded}} with new voice announcements. <b>The</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> now female, and now advises to touch {{on and off}} when using Myki.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> also {{featured}} in {{use on the}} Vocaloid Keyboard prototype.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> that of Matthew Quintal. McCoy {{let him in}} at once.|$|R

25|$|A castrato (Italian, plural: castrati) {{is a type}} of {{classical}} male singing voice equivalent to that of a soprano, mezzo-soprano, or contralto. <b>The</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> produced by castration of the singer before puberty, or it occurs in one who, due to an endocrinological condition, never reaches sexual maturity.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{hearing aids}} include {{wireless}} hearing aids. One hearing aid can transmit {{to the other}} side so that pressing one aid's program button simultaneously changes the other aid, so that both aids change background settings simultaneously. FM listening systems are now emerging with wireless receivers integrated with the use of hearing aids. A separate wireless microphone can be given to a partner to wear in a restaurant, in the car, during leisure time, in the shopping mall, at lectures, or during religious services. <b>The</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> transmitted wirelessly to the hearing aids eliminating the effects of distance and background noise. FM systems have shown to give the best speech understanding in noise of all available technologies.|$|E
25|$|A {{defining}} {{characteristic of}} a Goa'uld host is a brief glowing of the eyes. This occurs when the Goa'uld first takes control and upon its death, {{as well as in}} moments of extreme emotion or to add emphasis or intimidation. A Goa'uld-occupied host typically speaks in an eerily flanged, deepened register. However, <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> not necessary, and Goa'uld can speak in a normal tone if they choose, usually when they need to deceive someone. The Goa'uld instill their hosts with superhuman strength, perfect health, and accelerated healing. The host's life is also lengthened into centuries, which the Goa'uld extend even further using a sarcophagus. However, repeated use of the sarcophagus has severe psychological consequences, and is believed to be a main factor in the Goa'uld's evil. Being host to a Goa'uld {{has been described as a}} living nightmare, and those humans who have been hosts for thousands of years are widely suspected to have gone insane.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> not <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> of Nicholas, and the {{intelligence}} was strange. 'I--I don't understand. Mr. Bellston?' she faintly replied.|$|R
50|$|When {{released}} internationally, most of <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>were</b> dubbed {{because of}} poor sound production.|$|R

25|$|Multimodal {{stimulation}} and music: By combining music, such as lullabies, and multimodal stimulation, premature infants were {{discharged from}} the NICU sooner, than those infants who did not receive therapy. Multimodal stimulation (MMS) includes the applications of auditory, tactile, vestibular, and visual stimulation that helps aid in premature infant development. The combination of music and MMS helps premature infants sleep and conserve vital energy required to gain weight more rapidly. Studies have shown that girls respond more positively than boys during multimodal stimulation. While <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> a popular choice for parents looking to bond with their premature infants, other effective instruments include the Remo Ocean Disk and the Gato Box. Both are used to stimulate {{the sounds of the}} womb. The Remo Ocean Disk, a round musical instrument that mimics the fluid sounds of the womb, has been shown to benefit decreased heart rate after therapeutic uses, as well as promoting healthy sleep patterns, lower respiratory rates and improve sucking behavior.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{the talent}} of singing has become competitive. Currently, {{there are several}} {{television}} shows that showcase these talents. American Idol {{was one of the}} prominent of these shows. Debuted in 2002, {{it was one of the}} first singing competition shows.The first singing reality show was Sa Re Ga Ma Pa launched by Zee TV in the 1995..At the American Idol Contestants audition in front of a panel of judges to see if they can move on to the next round in Hollywood, from then, the competition begins. The field of contestants is narrowed down week by week until a winner is chosen. In order to move on to the next round, the contestants fate is determined by public vote. <b>The</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>is</b> another well-known singing competition program. Similar to American Idol, the contestants audition in front of a panel of judges, however, the judges chairs are faced towards the audience during the performance. If the coaches are interested in the artist, they will press their button signifying they want to coach them. Once the auditions conclude, coaches have their team of artists and the competition begins. Coaches then mentor their artists and they compete to find the best singer. Other well-known singing competitions include The X Factor, America's Got Talent, Rising Star and The Sing-Off.|$|E
500|$|The bass aria on {{the tenth}} verse from the psalm, [...] "" [...] (The Lord is King eternally), employs a triadic motif {{similar to that}} of Gott ist mein König, BWV 71. It is short and has a limited range of tonal {{development}} or chromatic variation. <b>The</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> accompanied by the horns and timpani, vithout strings, illustrating God's power.|$|E
5000|$|The music, sound effects, {{and some}} of <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>were</b> {{completely}} different, even though Carlos Alazraqui did all <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> in both versions.|$|R
60|$|When the hymn ceased one of <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>was</b> {{raised in}} a reverent and {{continuous}} tone, which <b>was</b> obviously <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> of prayer.|$|R
5000|$|Reaction to <b>the</b> dog's <b>voices</b> <b>were</b> mixed. Pocket Gamers Matt Suckley {{said that}} <b>the</b> dog's <b>voices</b> [...] "steal away the game's charm" [...] and heavily criticized the {{decision}} to give them full human vocabularies. Destructoid's Brittany Vincent disagreed, noting that <b>the</b> <b>voices</b> <b>were</b> [...] "positively [...] "aww"-inducing from the get-go".|$|R
500|$|In the alto aria, [...] "Ich will doch wohl Rosen brechen" [...] (I will yet indeed pluck roses), <b>the</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> {{accompanied}} by the strings and a violin obbligato in virtuoso figuration, which may illustrate the heavenly light promised as the final fulfillment. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, interprets the solo violin's motif as an image of plucking a rose, who notes that the solo violin is silent when fulfillment is reached ("For He has pledged His word").|$|E
500|$|The only chorale stanza of {{the work}} is [...] "" [...] ("I, Your troubled child"), the third stanza of Johann Heermann's [...] "" [...] ("Where should I flee"), {{published}} in 1630. Its term [...] "troubled child" [...] is a good summary of the position of the human being in relation to God. The wording of its conclusion, [...] "In deine tiefen Wunden, da ich stets Heil gefunden" [...] ("into Your deep wounds, where I have always found salvation") leads to the following recitative. <b>The</b> <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> accompanied by an obbligato viola (violoncello piccolo in the Leipzig version) in a lively figuration.|$|E
500|$|An aria with obbligato organ, [...] "" [...] (God {{has made}} {{everything}} well), {{is the first}} movement in a major mode, expressing pleasure with God's creation. It has a dominating two-part ritornello. Hofmann observes that the organ, this time the only partner of <b>the</b> <b>voice,</b> <b>is</b> [...] "rich in coloratura" [...] and has a theme, [...] "heard throughout the movement, sometimes {{in the manner of}} an ostinato, sometimes freely developed; in its figuration and motoric drive it is stylized just like Bach’s writing for the violoncello piccolo". Gardiner notes that not only the tessitura but also [...] "characteristic string-crossing patterns" [...] are reminiscent of violoncello piccolo use.|$|E
