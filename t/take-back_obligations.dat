The German regulatory solution, relying on <b>take-back</b> <b>obligations</b> for producers, {{free for the}} last holder, is contrasted with a rule of partial cost recovery. It is shown that the cost-recovery rule saves infra-strucure costs and avoids the anti-competitive impacts of the take-back obligation. In contrast to the take-back obligation, the cost-recovery rule {{makes it possible to}} optimize between the environmental and competition policy objectives, and it can thus defuse the alleged tradoff between these policy areas. This paper concludes by giving a mixed judgement on the European Guideline...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Sustainable development, {{along with}} {{technological}} and economical trends dictate {{the development of}} efficient “closed-loop supply chains”. “Ecological motivation ” is a strategic issue of increased importance for the profitability of reverse supply chains due to companies ’ concerns about their “green image ” and environmental legislation. Ecological motivation manifests {{through a variety of}} issues that are investigated in this work, including the <b>take-back</b> <b>obligations</b> and lower limits of recycling imposed by legislation, green consumerism and design for environment (DfE). In this paper, we present a novel generalized methodological framework that captures these issues comprehensively based on the principles of the system dynamics (SD) methodology. The framework is generic enough to accommodate a number of real-world problem instances (with the appropriate fine tuning) and it can be used for the conduct of various “what-if ” analyses, by evaluating the impact of regulatory measures and green consumerism on system performance. The generalized framework is implemented to a major Greek paper producer with recycling activities as a real-world test case...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Sustainable development, {{along with}} {{technological}} and economical trends {{have led to}} the development of efficient “closed-loop supply chains”. In this context, “ecological motivation ” is a strategic issue of increased importance for the profitability of reverse supply chains due to companies ’ concerns about their “green image ” and environmental legislation. In this paper we examine the impact of the ecological motivation on the long term behavior of a simple system that can be encountered on a variety of real-world cases, namely that of a single producer and a single product chain with recycling activities. Ecological motivation manifests through a variety of issues that are investigated, including the <b>take-back</b> <b>obligations,</b> lower limits of recycling imposed by legislation, green consumerism and design for environment (DfE). We develop a novel modeling approach that captures these issues comprehensively by exploiting the principles of the system dynamics (SD) theory. The dynamic model provides a simulation tool, which can be used for the conduct of various “what-if ” analyses, by evaluating the impact of various regulatory measures and green consumerism on system performance. Finally, we discuss the potential value of the proposed modeling procedure in managing real world cases...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} disassembly sequence generation for electronic equipment. This is particularly useful because adequate end-of-life disassembly becomes crucial as <b>take-back</b> <b>obligations</b> are imposed for environmental reasons. Besides this, the hierarchical structure, typical to electronic products, makes product remanufacturing to an important topic. Methods from disassembly of mechanical assemblies are successfully adapted to these specific challenges. First, a modeling method for assemblies is described, which is aimed at automatically determining the optimum disassembly sequence. It is argued that the information, which is condensed in the connection diagram and the set of precedence relations, is sufficient for the automatic generation of such a sequence. Appropriate use of the precedence relations reduces {{the size of the}} model, that can be represented as an AND/OR graph with a restricted number of subassemblies and actions. With disassembly costs and revenues included, the optimum disassembly sequence can be found with standard linear programming software, thus without the need of visiting the complete search space. As a matter of fact, the size of the problem is strongly reduced, as it increases only linear with the number of parts in the assembly. It has been demonstrated that the model nearly instantaneously generates the optimum disassembly sequence. Besides this, the model can generate near optimum sequences as well, which is beneficial if multiple criteria are considered...|$|E
40|$|In theory, {{individual}} producer responsibility (IPR) creates {{incentives for}} "design-for-recycling". Yet in practice, implementing IPR is challenging, particularly if applied to waste electric and electronic equipment. This article discusses different options for implementing IPR schemes and producers' under German WEEE legislation. In addition, practical {{aspects of a}} German "return share" brand sampling scheme are examined. Concerning "new" WEEE put on the market after 13 August 2006, producers in Germany can choose between two different methods of calculating <b>take-back</b> <b>obligations.</b> These can be determined {{on the basis of}} "return shares" or "market shares". While market shares are regularly monitored by a national clearing house, the "return share" option requires sampling and sorting of WEEE. Herein itis shown that the specifics of the German WEEE take-back scheme require high sample sizes and multi-step test procedures to ensure a statistically sound sampling approach. Since the market share allocation continues to apply for historic waste, producers lack incentives for choosing the costly brand sampling option. However, even return share allocation might not imply a decisive step towards IPR, as it merely represents an alternative calculation of market shares. Yet the fundamental characteristics of the German take-back system remain unchanged: the same anonymous mix of WEEE goes to the same treatment operations. In the future, radio frequency identification-based sorting options could foster IPR and incentives for changes in product design.
