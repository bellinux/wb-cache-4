5|$|Due to {{the strain}} on the oxygen supplies, the crew decides to abandon most of the {{equipment}} and to cut short the lunar stay. The repair work is completed slightly ahead of schedule, and the rocket cleared for lift-off. Halfway to Earth, Jorgen escapes his bonds thanks to the detectives' bungling and tries to kill Tintin and the others; Wolff seeks to prevent him, and in their struggle over a gun Jorgen is killed. When it is revealed that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> enough oxygen aboard for the crew to survive the journey, Wolff sacrifices himself by opening the airlock and floating out into space to his death. The crew fall unconscious but Tintin wakes long enough to set the rocket to auto-pilot and it arrives back in Syldavia safely.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{impacts of}} ashfall {{can affect the}} operation of water treatment plants. Ash can block intake structures, cause severe abrasion damage to pump impellers and overload pump motors. Many water treatment plants have an initial coagulation/flocculation step that is automatically adjusted to turbidity (the level of suspended solids, measured in nephelometric turbidity units) in the incoming water. In most cases, changes in turbidity caused by suspended ash particles will be within the normal operating range of the plant and can be managed satisfactorily by adjusting the addition of coagulant. Ashfalls {{will be more likely}} to cause problems for plants that are not designed for high levels of turbidity and which may omit coagulation/flocculation treatment. Ash can enter filtration systems such as open sand filters both by direct fallout and via intake waters. In most cases, increased maintenance will be required to manage the effects of an ashfall, but <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> service interruptions.|$|E

25|$|Decisions {{are based}} on the advice of the Amir-ul Momineen. For us {{consultation}} is not necessary. We believe that this is in line with the Sharia.

Mullah Omar will be the highest authority and the government {{will not be able to}} implement any decision to which he does not agree.

In all these situations, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> a unique mean. For example, the times {{an hour before}} and after midnight are equidistant to both midnight and noon. It {{is also possible that}} no mean exists. Consider a color wheel -- there is no mean to the set of all colors. In these situations, you must decide which mean is most useful. You can do this by adjusting the values before averaging, or by using a specialized approach for the mean of circular quantities.|$|E

25|$|Haiman {{describes}} iconic {{expression and}} conceptual distance and how two concepts are conceptually close if they share semantic properties, affect {{each other and}} cannot be separated from one another. Joseph Greenberg hypothesizes that {{the distance between the}} possessor and possessee in a sentence with alienable possession will be greater than it will be in sentences inalienable constructions. Because the possessor and the possessee have a close conceptual relationship, their relative positions with a sentence reflect this and <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> a lot of distance between them. Increasing the distance between the two would in turn increase their conceptual independence.|$|E
25|$|Another {{less obvious}} error can also occur when heating the dies. After being {{taken out of}} the {{annealing}} furnace, the dies must cool for 24 to 36 hours. They are usually given an oil bath to cool them more quickly, but the dies must still cool for a period of several hours. When the dies are cooling, if they are not stored properly or not allowed to fully cool before being used, the result is a much softer die. When the die is subjected to the hubbing press again and work hardened again, it will be softer and more susceptible to wear. If the die is softer because it was not fully cooled, it will not harden to the same standard as a die which has received proper treatment. However, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> a noticeable difference between a good die and a bad die; the change {{in the structure of the}} die does is not apparent until it is used for a period of time.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} discipline, effort and {{attention}} needed from both divers in a buddy pair, and the even greater input required in a three diver team, is unattractive to a confident diver who has {{other things to}} do during a straightforward, low risk, recreational dive, and the system is undermined when any one of the divers fails to put in the effort, putting the burden on the remaining diver who takes the responsibilities more seriously. Familiarity with the environment, and the very low incidence of life-threatening accidents is likely to lead to a confidence that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> a problem on any given dive, so the divers may pay less attention to good buddy practices, and this may become habitual. This may be exacerbated by the divers being strangers thrown together by chance and the whims of the divemaster, who have no real interest in each other, and whose reasons to dive may be incompatible. Pairing an explorer with a macro photographer will annoy at least one, probably both, if they comply with recommended buddy diving practices. Many nominally buddy dives effectively become solo dives soon after entering the water, with the buddies occasionally checking for the presence of each other and often being beyond direct view of each other. In spite of this, very few of these divers die as a consequence.|$|E

Watney, being a botanist, improvises a farm inside the Hab utilizing Martian soil fertilized with human waste, water produced by extracting hydrogen from leftover rocket fuel, and potatoes intended for Thanksgiving dinner.

500|$|After {{receiving}} {{reports of}} mass casualties and destruction at Pass-a-Grille, the American Red Cross stocked a United States Navy subchaser with pine caskets and relief supplies, but found no bodies {{and only a}} fraction of the reported damage. Because of fears that the hurricane might hinder the Florida land boom of the 1920s, rebuilding and cleanup of the area commenced quickly and the land boom in the Tampa Bay region and in southern Florida continued. Local officials, businessmen, realtors, and later the press soon attempted to cover up or downplay the damage, which threatened to distort Tampa's advertised image as the [...] "Year Round City". On October28, a writer for The Tampa Tribune stated, [...] "Everyone is accepting the storm as an incident and all are going to work to rebuild the devastated areas, with the firm conviction that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> another storm of such severity during the life of anyone now living." [...] One of the destroyed buildings at the Ballist Point Pavilion was soon rebuilt after the storm. However, the building was destroyed again by fire in 1922. In 1925, a new pavilion was built. On Captiva Island, the Wayside Chapel suffered extensive damage, but was repaired and reopened as Captiva School and Chapel-by-the-Sea, which has been listed as a National Historic Place since 2013.

60|$|Should {{the reader}} require an example {{a little more}} within {{historical}} range, or a little more subject to critical tests, than the above prehistoric anecdote (which I need <b>not</b> say <b>was</b> revealed {{to me in a}} vision) it would be easy enough to supply them both in a hypothetical and a historical form. It is obvious enough in a general way that if we begin to subject diverse countries to an identical test, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> only <b>be</b> rivalry, but what is far more deadly and disastrous, superiority. If we institute a competition between Holland and Switzerland as to the relative grace and agility of their mountain guides, it will be clear that the decision is disproportionately easy; it will also be clear that certain facts about the configuration of Holland have escaped our international eye. If we establish a comparison between them in skill and industry in the art of building dykes against the sea, it will be equally clear that the injustice falls the other way; it will also be clear that the situation of Switzerland on the map has received insufficient study. In both cases <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> only <b>be</b> rivalry but very unbalanced and unjust rivalry; in both cases, therefore, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> only <b>be</b> enmity but very bitter or insolent enmity. But so long as the two are sharply divided there can be no enmity because there can be no rivalry. Nobody can argue about whether the Swiss climb mountains better than the Dutch build dykes; just as nobody can argue about whether a triangle is more triangular than a circle is round.|$|R
