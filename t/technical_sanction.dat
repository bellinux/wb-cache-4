Indent management is the workflow {{involved in the}} preparation of tenders. This part of the value chain is optional, with individual procuring departments defining their indenting process. In works procurement, administrative approval and <b>technical</b> <b>sanction</b> are obtained in electronic format. In goods procurement, indent generation activity is done online.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1980s the ISA (International Society of Automation) began {{an effort to}} develop a set of {{standards}} for the Batch Control Industry {{with the intent of}} providing improved system performance and programming efficiencies by way of a standard set of models and procedures. ISA-S88 Part 5 (Make2Pack) was written to provide a standard specifically for Equipment Modules and Control Modules. Starting in the early 2000s OMAC (Organization for Machine Automation and Control) began work on a similar standard that embraced some of the basic concepts developed for the Batch Control Industry with the intent of providing the same benefits to the Machine Control Industry, specifically for Packaging Machines. [...] These standards continued in parallel development until 2008 when an ISA <b>sanctioned</b> <b>technical</b> report was written to harmonize these standards. ISA TR88.00.02-2008 Machine and Unit States: An Implementation Example of ISA-88 became the basis of the Packaging Standard known as PackML. The ISA-S88 Standard {{can be found at the}} ISA website and the OMAC PackML Implementation Guide can be found at the 'OMAC website.|$|R
