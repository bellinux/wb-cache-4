40|$|Three {{species of}} <b>fescue</b> <b>grass</b> Festuca rubra, Festuca pratensis and Festuca arundinaceae were {{evaluated}} for their potential to produce green herbage and {{to control the}} soil erosion. Three parameters including number of tillers, fresh and dry weight per plant in different cuttings during whole season (March-September) were investigated. Festuca arundinaceae showed its potential for maximum production of tillers {{as well as the}} values of fresh and dry weight during all cuttings in a season followed by Festuca pratensis and Festuca rubra. However, the latter two species were found to be early growing in spring and persist during late fall. The <b>fescue</b> <b>grasses</b> also produced good rooting system to hold the soil. The combination of <b>fescue</b> <b>grasses</b> with other species will have significant effect in increasing the period of green forage availability in national pastures and holding the soil prone to erosion because of over-grazing and lack of cover during winter. The species could also be utilised in future forage breeding programmes in the country...|$|R

She is credited with helping to develop a new class, the miniature <b>tall</b> <b>bearded</b> irises, which she appreciated for their potential as cut flowers. She termed them 'table irises' and provided the first description of the class. She introduced at least five new cultivars of intermediate bearded irises and at least 60 of <b>tall</b> <b>bearded</b> irises.|$|R

40|$|Epichloë typhina, a clavicipitaceous {{systemic}} phytopathogen, {{was isolated}} from two varieties and three hybrids of tall fescue (Festuca arundinaceae). The morphology of the fescue isolates was compared with E. typhina isolated from bent grass (Agrostis perennans). In all isolates, conidia were identical and were typical of E. typhina. In <b>fescue</b> <b>grasses</b> the endophyte {{failed to produce}} stromata, but on bent grass the fungus seasonally produced stromata, typical of the genus. Cattle grazing the <b>fescue</b> <b>grasses</b> showed signs of the fescue toxicity syndrome, the E. typhina was found in frequencies of 100 %; in grasses from pastures in which cattle {{showed no signs of}} the syndrome, frequencies were 0 to 50 %. Nutritional factors in vitro were more complex for the isolates from fescue than for the isolate from bent grass. These studies suggested that E. typhina includes biotypes that might be involved in the toxicity syndrome. The fescue biotypes grew poorly on media, and yields were inadequate for toxicity studies. However, the bent grass isolate grew well on three media, and extracts from two of these were toxic to chicken embryos. All isolates produced in vitro the nontoxic fungal steroid tetraenone [ergosta- 4, 6, 8 (14), 22 -tetraen- 3 -one], which has been isolated from toxic <b>fescue</b> <b>grasses...</b>|$|R
