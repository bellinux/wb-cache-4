25|$|The {{coherence}} and low divergence angle of laser light, aided by focusing from {{the lens of}} an eye, can cause laser radiation to be concentrated into an extremely small spot on the retina. A transient increase of only 10 °C can destroy retinal photoreceptor cells. If the laser is sufficiently powerful, permanent damage can occur within {{a fraction of a}} second, literally faster than <b>the</b> <b>blink</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>eye.</b> Sufficiently powerful lasers in the visible to near infrared range (400-1400nm) will penetrate the eyeball and may cause heating of the retina, whereas exposure to laser radiation with wavelengths less than 400nm and greater than 1400nm are largely absorbed by the cornea and lens, leading to the development of cataracts or burn injuries.|$|E
