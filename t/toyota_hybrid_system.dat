This <b>hybrid</b> <b>system</b> {{contains}} a power-split planetary gear system which combines the benefits of series and parallel hybrid vehicles. In this paper, we developed a dynamic model of the THS powertrain and then apply it for model-based control development. Two control algorithms are introduced: one based on the stochastic dynamic programming method, and the other based on the equivalent consumption minimization strategy. Both approaches determine the engine power based on the overall vehicle efficiency and apply the electrical machines to optimize the engine operation. The performance of these two algorithms is assessed by comparing against the dynamic programming results, which are non-causal but provide theoretical benchmarks for other implementable control algorithms.

The second generation system THS II first appeared on the redesigned Prius in 2004.

5000|$|The <b>Toyota</b> <b>Hybrid</b> <b>System</b> THS / Hybrid Synergy Drive has {{a single}} {{power-split}} device (incorporated as a single three-shaft planetary gearset) and can be classified as an Input-Split, since {{the power of the}} engine is split at the input to the transmission. This in turn makes this setup very simple in mechanical terms, but has drawbacks of its own. For example, in Generation 1 and Generation 2 HSDs maximum speed is mainly limited by the speed of the smaller electric motor (often functioning as a generator). The Generation 3 HSD separates the ICE-MG1 path from the MG2 path, each with its own, tailored gear ratio (1.1:1 and 2.5:1, respectively, for late Priuses, including the Prius c). The Generation 4 HSD eliminates the second planetary gear set, and places the electric motors on parallel axes, with a combining gear in between these axes, and transfers the combined result to the final drive differential. This is quite similar to Toyota-affiliated Aisin Seiki's hybrid system, and saves significant space.General Motors, BMW, and DaimlerChrysler collaborated on a system named [...] "Two-Mode Hybrid" [...] as part of the Global Hybrid Cooperation. The technology was released in the fall of 2007 on the Chevrolet Tahoe Hybrid. The system was also featured on the GMC Graphite SUV concept vehicle at the 2005 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. BYD Auto's F3DM sedan is a series-parallel plug-in hybrid automobile, which went on sale in China in 2008.|$|E

40|$|Planetary gear (PG) {{power-split}} hybrid powertrains {{have been}} used in producing hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles from the Toyota, General Motor, and Ford for years. Some of the most recent designs use clutches to enable multiple operating modes to improve launching performance and/or fuel economy. Adding clutches and multiple operating modes, however, also increases production cost and design complexity. To enable an ex-haustive but fast search for optimal designs among a large number of hardware configura-tions, clutch locations, and mode selections, an automated modeling and screening process is developed in this paper. Combining this process with the power-weighted effi-ciency analysis for rapid sizing method (PEARS), an optimal and computationally efficient energy management strategy, the extremely large design space of configuration, compo-nent sizing, and control becomes feasible to search through. This methodology to identify optimal designs has yet to be reported in the literature.
