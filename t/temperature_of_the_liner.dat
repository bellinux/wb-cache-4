Originally Vogt developed the technique {{as a method}} for the introduction of large sample volumes (up to 250 µL) in capillary GC. Vogt introduced the sample into the liner at a controlled injection rate. The <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> was chosen slightly below the boiling point of the solvent. The low-boiling solvent was continuously evaporated and vented through the split line. Based on this technique, Poy developed the programmed temperature vaporising injector; PTV. By introducing the sample at a low initial liner temperature many of the disadvantages of the classic hot injection techniques could be circumvented.|$|E

It {{is based on a}} suction and an injection model to reproduce <b>the</b> average effect <b>of</b> effusion cooling on both sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plate. The coupled suction/injection model has been specifically designed to be used in industrial full-scale computations of gas turbine combustion chambers, where effusion cooling is commonly used for controlling <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liners.</b> Notably, it can be used with a coarse grid, the real perforated plate being replaced by a homogeneous boundary condition where the model is applied. The new modeled boundary condition conserves <b>the</b> inviscid part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall fluxes, which are shown to be the main contribution, as evidenced by <b>the</b> analysis <b>of</b> former wall-resolved simulations. Conserving the wall fluxes allows reproduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flow and leads to reasonable comparisons with experimental data. Hence, the proposed new model provides a practical way {{to account for}} multiperforated plates with inclined perforations without resolving the flow in the perforations...|$|R

In this manuscript, a testing method is proposed to determine the long-term creep behavior of encased polymer and felt-reinforced polymer liners used in sewer rehabilitation. Long-term tests are conducted on liner samples encased in steel pipes, installed by the industries participating in the research project. <b>The</b> thicknesses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polymer <b>liners</b> are selected according to <b>the</b> typical use <b>of</b> each product in the field.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>liner</b> {{contains}} <b>the</b> {{combustion process}} and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and cooling, see Air flow paths below) into the combustion zone. <b>The</b> <b>liner</b> must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, <b>the</b> <b>liners</b> must be cooled with air flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, air cooling is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; film cooling and transpiration cooling. Film cooling works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> to just inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liner.</b> This creates a thin film of cool air that protects <b>the</b> <b>liner,</b> reducing <b>the</b> temperature at <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. <b>The</b> other type <b>of</b> <b>liner</b> cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for <b>the</b> <b>liner.</b> <b>The</b> porous <b>liner</b> allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to film cooling. The two primary differences are in <b>the</b> resulting <b>temperature</b> profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> and <b>the</b> amount <b>of</b> cooling air required. Transpiration cooling results in a much more even temperature profile, as the cooling air is uniformly introduced through pores. Film cooling air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less cooling air (on <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for film cooling). Using less air for cooling allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|R

Three technologies have been combined {{to produce an}} advanced liquid rocket engine combustion chamber at NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) using relatively low-cost, vacuum-plasma-spray (VPS) techniques. Copper alloy NARloy-Z was replaced with a new high performance Cu- 8 Cr- 4 Nb alloy developed by NASA-Glenn Research Center (GRC), which possesses excellent high-temperature strength, creep resistance, and low cycle fatigue behavior combined with exceptional thermal stability.

40|$|Monitoring and {{predicting}} {{the residual limb}} skin health in amputees is of principal importance as <b>the</b> socket <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prosthesis creates an airtight, warm and damp environment that encourages growth of bacteria and skin breakdown. Elevated stump skin <b>temperatures</b> are one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major factors that affect the tissue health in that region [1]. Monitoring interface temperature at skin level is notoriously complicated. The problem might be considered notorious because embedding wires and sensors in an elastomer eventually results in elastomer failures because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high strain induced when donning a <b>liner</b> (amputees roll <b>the</b> <b>liners</b> onto their limbs). Another reason is because placing sensors and wires directly against the skin could cause irritation and chaffing over just a short period <b>of</b> time. <b>The</b> heat dissipation in prosthetic sockets is greatly influenced by the thermal conductive properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> socket and interface liner materials [2]. This leads to a hypothesis that if <b>the</b> thermal properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> socket & <b>liner</b> materials are known then the in-socket stump temperature could be accurately predicted by just measuring the prosthetic socket or liner temperature. A mathematical model using the Gaussian processes for machine learning to predict the residual limb skin <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amputee by measuring the in-socket temperature has been developed [3]. Here we compare <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> Gaussian processes for regression to the other computational method namely support vector machines (SVM). Methods: To investigate the correlation between <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> thermocouples (skin and in-socket), one trans-tibial traumatic amputee was recruited to perform in a 35 minute laboratory protocol (see Table). To monitor and record the skin and in-socket temperatures, four K–type thermocouples via a data logger were used. Two thermocouples were taped onto the residual limb in lateral and medial position. The other two thermocouples were put on the corresponding positions on <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> (in-socket). Activity Time (minutes) Resting/Sitting 10 Walk at self-selected pace of 0. 62 metres/second on a treadmill 10 Final rest 15 <b>The</b> <b>temperature</b> profiles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> and <b>the</b> residual limb skin were recorded for ambient <b>temperatures</b> <b>of</b> 10 °C, and then the same protocol was repeated for 15 °C, 20 °C, and 25 °C. All experiments were conducted in a climate controlled chamber with zero wind velocity and 40 % humidity level. It was seen that at any given ambient <b>temperature,</b> <b>the</b> trace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> <b>temperature</b> follows that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> residual limb skin. This suggested a possibility to model <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> temperature as a function <b>of</b> skin <b>temperature</b> and create a mathematical model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same. Different modelling techniques for machine learning were utilized and {{the results from the}} Gaussian processes model and support vector regression technique are compared in this study. Results: The results (see Figure) indicate <b>the</b> predictive capability <b>of</b> both Gaussian Processes and SVM modelling techniques at the lateral side at an ambient <b>temperature</b> <b>of</b> 10 ºC. <b>The</b> key assumption in Gaussian Process modelling is that our data can be represented as a sample from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. A Gaussian process model infers a joint probability distribution over all possible outputs for all inputs.

When the lining plate is subjected to the same pressure, the moving distance increases, and the lining plate is seriously worn. This method has some reference value for cavity design of new crusher and other material wear research...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} four liner {{implosion}} experiments, denoted <b>the</b> Near Term <b>Liner</b> Experiments (NTLX) was recently {{conducted on the}} Shiva Star capacitor bank at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). Measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driving currents in these experiments is required for post-shot analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> implosion and experiments conducted in the target cylinder. A Faraday rotation measurement was fielded on Shiva Star to measure the current and compare with the current measured by a Rogowski coil technique. The Faraday rotation technique measured the 16 MA currents in these experiments with better than 1 % precision. In addition, six B-dot probes were fielded at equal angles around a circle in the powerflow channel outside <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> to measure <b>the</b> symmetry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> impact on <b>the</b> target cylinder. The B-dot probes measure the local I-dot, which has a jump when <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> impacts <b>the</b> target cylinder. A high-pass filter allows one to measure this jump more accurately. From <b>the</b> relative timing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jump signals, <b>the</b> offset <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> axis and <b>the</b> circularity <b>of</b> <b>liner</b> are inferred...|$|R

The {{pollutants}} in the {{municipal solid waste}} landfill leachate result in severe damage to <b>the</b> environment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> groundwater and the soil beneath the municipal solid waste landfill. <b>The</b> <b>liner</b> systems with a low leakage performance are commonlly adopted under the municipal solid waste landfills to stop <b>the</b> contaminants <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leachate from polluting the environment. Even there are the rigorous demands in related specifications for <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> system in <b>the</b> landfill. Pollution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> groundwater and the soil beneath the landfill still occurred in {{a large number of}} rubbish landfills because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seepage. To investigate <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compact clay layer (CCL) on <b>the</b> seepage performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> systems, parametric analyses are conducted to study <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thickness <b>of</b> CCL and <b>the</b> hydraulic conductivity <b>of</b> CCL on <b>the</b> leakage performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> system. In conclusion, some suggestions for <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> municipal solid waste landfills are proposed based on the analyses results...|$|R

This permitted the low frequency level to be increased to required values while attenuating the high frequency noise, thus achieving the required roll-off to simulate the Space Transportation System (STS) payload bay acoustic environment. <b>The</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> and <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>liner</b> to determine its attenuation characteristics are described...|$|R
