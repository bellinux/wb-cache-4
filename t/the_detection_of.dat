30|$|Several score {{normalization}} {{and system}} combination approaches {{were presented in}} [91]. Score normalization based on term-dependent thresholding, rank normalization and mapping back to posteriors, sum-to-one normalization, and machine learning. The term-dependent thresholding simply re-scores <b>the</b> <b>detection</b> by considering <b>the</b> confidence scores <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> <b>detections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> given term in the ATWV formulation. The rank normalization {{is based on the}} false alarm rate for the given term as score normalization value for each term <b>detection.</b> <b>The</b> mapping back to posteriors approach relies on the average posteriors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>detections</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> terms except that being detected that are ranked in the same position within <b>the</b> <b>detection</b> list for <b>the</b> given term. The sum-to-one approach normalizes <b>the</b> score <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>detection</b> by <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> scores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>detections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> given term. The machine learning approach is based on a linear model by applying the Powell’s method [76] to maximize ATWV performance from several input features (e.g., rank normalization, mapping back to posteriors, term length, etc.). System combination merged <b>the</b> <b>detections</b> from different STD systems that rely on different approaches (e.g., GMM-based and DNN-based HMMs) and combined <b>the</b> <b>detection</b> scores from Powell’s method.|$|R

System combination took {{the output of}} the different ASR systems and merged <b>the</b> <b>detections</b> <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> systems. <b>Detection</b> scores are normalized by the sum of all <b>the</b> scores <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>detections</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> given term. Experimental results showed that (1) CNNs perform very well for keyword search, (2) audio segmentation plays a very important role in keyword search, and (3) system combination yields significant performance gains.|$|R
40|$|Background—Plasma tumor {{biomarkers}} {{are widely}} used clinically for monitoring response to therapy and detecting cancer recurrence. However, {{only a limited number}} of them have been effectively used for <b>the</b> early <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> cancer. Objective—To review plasma tumor markers used clinically for <b>the</b> early <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> cancer and to provide expert opinion about future directions. Methods—Literature review, as well as our expert opinion, of plasma tumor markers that have been widely accepted for <b>the</b> early <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> cancer. Results—In <b>the</b> United States, only prostate specific antigen (PSA), cancer antigen 125 (CA 125), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) have been clinically used for <b>the</b> early <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> prostate, ovarian, and liver cancers, respectively. Both analytical and clinical issues related to the use of these three markers were discussed. Conclusion—Few plasma tumor markers have been used effectively for <b>the</b> early <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> cancer, mainly due to their limited sensitivity and/or specificity. Multiple approaches have been developed to improve the clinical performance of tumor markers for <b>the</b> early <b>detection</b> <b>of</b> cancer. Metrological traceability and antibody specificity are important issues to ensure comparability of immunoassays for the measurement of plasma tumor markers...|$|R

30|$|In this section, a low-complexity ML {{decoding}} algorithm {{exploiting the}} unique properties highlighted {{in the previous}} section is proposed for the 3 D MIMO code.
