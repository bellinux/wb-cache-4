[...] is an online program that allows users <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>data</b> relating to a residential development, such as location, size, building materials etc.; to receive scores against water and energy use reduction targets. Water targets range from a 0 to 40% reduction in consumption of mains-supplied potable water, depending on location of the residential development. Ninety per cent of new homes are covered by the 40% water target. The BASIX program allows for the modelling of some WSUD elements such as use of rainwater tanks, stormwater tanks and greywater recycling.|$|E

50|$|SPIRIT (Stroke Performance Indicators for Reporting, Improvement & Translation), is {{a web-based}} RCSN Stroke Registry that enables stroke-care {{providers}} the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>data</b> on stroke {{patients at the}} point of care in a timely manner. Data is securely transmitted to a central data repository for analysis and feedback. The data is used to determine stroke care performance in real-time so that hospitals can monitor their own performance and compare themselves to other institutions. The current SPIRIT module focuses on collecting data from Stroke Prevention Clinics and, in development, is the Acute Care SPIRIT module that will allow sites <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>data</b> on their acute stroke patients including patients treated with Telestroke. All data elements included in SPIRIT were derived from the Canadian Stroke Quality of Care Study and the Stroke Canada Optimization of Rehabilitation through Evidence project, which identified performance measures through a series of national consensus panels on stroke care delivery across parts of the continuum (acute care, secondary prevention, rehabilitation, telestroke).|$|E
