Therefore, the deployment of HBC system obtaining good communication performance is required. In this regard, a tutorial review on the important issues related to HBC data transmission such as signal propagation model, channel characteristics, communication performance, and experimental considerations is conducted. In this work, the development of HBC and its first attempts are firstly reviewed. Then a survey on the signal propagation models is introduced. Based on these models, the channel characteristics are summarized; the communication performance and selection of transmission parameters are also investigated.

The speed is improved by a more streamlined processing with on-the-fly result fusion. We submitted 10 runs for SBD evaluation task. The best result (TT 05) was achieved with the following configuration: SVM based verification method; more training data that includes 2004, 2005, and 2006 SBD data; no SVM boundary adjustment; training SVM with high generalization capability (e. g., a smaller value of C). As a pilot task, rushes summarization aims to show the main objects and events in the raw material with least redundancy while maximizing the usability.

This report presents an overview of evaluation measures, data collection and analysis methods that may serve to assess different aspects of perceptual lighting quality. Thereto, we identified appropriate methods and techniques to obtain data for several relevant parameters, statistically based data from participants and the external factors that have to be taken into account when studying a lighting concept (indoor or outdoor) in a field test.

Continuous evolution of intelligence being gathered of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>centric</b> activities has put increased focus on <b>the</b> <b>humans,</b> especially inferring their innate characteristics - size, shapes and physiology. These bio-signatures {{extracted from the}} surveillance sensors {{can be used to}} deduce age, ethnicity, gender and actions, and further characterize human actions in unseen scenarios. However, recovery of pose and shape of humans in such monocular videos is inherently an ill-posed problem, marked by frequent depth and view based ambiguities due to self-occlusion, foreshortening and misalignment. The likelihood function often yields a highly multimodal posterior that is difficult to propagate even using the most advanced particle filtering(PF) algorithms. Motivated by the recent success of the discriminative approaches to efficiently predict 3 D poses directly from the 2 D images, we present several principled approaches to integrate predictive cues using learned regression models to sustain multimodality of the posterior during tracking. Additionally, these learned priors can be actively adapted to the test data using a likelihood based feedback mechanism. Estimated 3 D poses are then used to fit 3 D human shape model to each frame independently for inferring anthropometric bio-signatures. The proposed system is fully automated, robust to noisy test data and has ability to swiftly recover from tracking failures even after confronting with significant errors. We evaluate the system on a large number of monocular human motion sequences. Comment: 13 Pages, 12 Figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to suggest an {{approach}} for holistical improvement of software development endeavor performance. The insights are a theory for mapping the key performance drivers of a software development system holistically, including <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>centric</b> factors {{that are involved in}} knowledge work, and a method for applying the theory in practice via a monitoring Instrument with case studies. The findings support that the theory complemented with the Instrument does provide holistic insights on a software development endeavor, reveals performance impediments and allows performance improvement efforts to be concentrated on the key performance drivers, i. e. where waste causes most performance decline. However further research is required for fine-tuning the Instrument for optimal performance indications. Suggestions for future work include an Instrument result coverage analysis and research on framework for quicker and easier analysis for more practical usage. Nevertheless, organizations can utilize the theory and the Instrument on as-is basis for improving software development performance without further research.

Tesis {{doctoral}} por el sistema de compendio de publicacionesThis {{doctoral dissertation}} proposes {{the creation and}} {{development of a new}} methodology for fuzzy system comprehensibility analysis based on fuzzy systems' inference maps, so-called fuzzy inference-grams, Fingrams in short. Fingrams show graphically fuzzy rule-based systems, presenting the interaction between rules at the inference level in terms of co-fired rules, i. e., rules fired at the same time by a given input. Even more, Fingrams are likely to act as an effective and efficient tool in several applications regarding both design and refinement of fuzzy systems. <b>The</b> <b>human</b> <b>centric</b> improvement of a fuzzy rule-based system could be done after analyzing the resulting graphs manually or assisted by well-known social network analysis techniques (such as community mining) and quality indexes (such as centrality, page rank and so on). The analysis of Fingrams offers many possibilities: measuring the comprehensibility of fuzzy systems, detecting redundancies and/or inconsistencies among fuzzy rules, finding out and analyzing instances not covered, identifying the most significant rules, and so forth. The new methodology has been tested and validated for fuzzy association rules, fuzzy rule-based classifiers and regressors. The utility of Fingrams over fuzzy association rules was illustrated in a real-world problem dealing with qualitative assessment of industrial objects designed through cognitive engineering. FURIA algorithm was used over a real dataset to show the possibilities of Fingrams in fuzzy rule-based classifiers. And, we selected an electrical network distribution problem to present the potential of Fingrams in the context of fuzzy rule-based regressors. Finally, it is worthy to note that Fingrams are fully integrated in different software tools thanks to the specific software implemented during the thesis period. The fuzzy modeling toolbox GUAJE, and the software suites for data mining KEEL and KNIME have been enhanced allowing the creation and analysis of Fingrams...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} dissertation is to investigate the phenomenon of learnability more deeply {{in order to better}} understand the learnability process. Grounded theory was used to determine the ground concepts based on fifteen users’ (N= 15) actions (N= 1836) in the WebCT Campus Edition’s virtual environment. Based on this study, the phenomenon of learnability and the learnability process is understood in greater detail and defined from <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>centric</b> of view, where <b>the</b> <b>human</b> being is <b>the</b> key actor. This {{doctoral dissertation}} answers the following research problem: 1. How learnable is the WebCT Campus Edition’s virtual environment? 2. How can the phenomenon of learnability be defined in a new way? The WebCT Campus Edition virtual environment’s learnability was measured with performance time and directions of action. In addition, the traditional learnability metrics of performance time and direction of users’ actions was used to verify the theoretical model of learnability and its nonlinearity. The result of this study showed that the variety of the WebCT Campus Edition’s learnability was higher between the individual users than it was between the different tasks. Therefore, the variety of task difficulty, i. e. the complexity or easiness of the different part of the user interface, have less influence on learnability in the WebCT Campus Edition than do the individual users’characteristics. Thus, the research results confirm the results found in earlier studies, where two important issues for usability evaluation and therefore evaluation on learnability, are the tasks and users individual characteristics. The theoretical model of learnability with following phases of information search, data collection, knowledge management, knowledge form, knowledge build and the result of action were determined from data. The theoretical model of learnability and its main patterns of a) data collection-information search, b) knowledge build-knowledge form and c) information searchknowledge management proves that learnability is a non-linear process. Therefore, the phenomenon of learnability cannot purely be defined by the separate properties of learnability, i. e. the properties of a user interface and a progressively enhanced linear process illustrated with learning curves. The theoretical model of learnability is one of the rare models of learnability that is based on empirical data. The use of grounded theory methodology means that the phenomenon of learnability is studied through tacit knowledge, i. e. through users’ real actions and though explicit knowledge, the users cognitive processes during interaction i. e. the phenomenon of learnability is approached from the holistic point of view, where the phenomenon of learnability is seen as one holistic process. Thus triangulation, where the phenomenon is interpreted through several split case studies are therefore unnecessary in this research setting. In conclusion, too many studies are still conducted in a laboratory situation using traditional methodological paradigms. More learnability studies with new methodological approaches in the natural environments are needed were <b>the</b> <b>human,</b> learning and non-linear process of learnability are in focus. It is important to understand more deeply the process of learnability and investigate more in greater detail the key elements that enhance learnability and on the other hand, cause learnability problems for users. Finally, based on the theoretical models of learnability, we can develop tools for the commercial user interface world in order to measure and test the learnability process more precisely and better understand how skills are actually learnt and how “to click” learnability...|$|R

It is gaining importance now a day in <b>the</b> scenario of <b>human</b> <b>centric</b> communication because it truly offers a natural means of interaction with <b>the</b> <b>human</b> body. Traditionally, near field communication (NFC) considers as a magnetic field coupling based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology. The RFID technology also limits the definition of NFC and thus reduces the scope {{of a wide range of}} applications. In recent years BCC, after its first origin in 1995, regain importance with its valuable application in biomedical systems. Primarily, KAIST and Philips research groups demonstrate BCC in the context of biomedical remote patient health monitoring system. BCC transceiver mainly consists of two parts: one is digital baseband and the other is an analog front end (AFE). In this thesis, an analog front end receiver has presented to support the overall BCC. The receiver (Rx) architecture consists of cascaded preamplifier and Schmitt trigger. When the signals are coming from <b>the</b> <b>human</b> body, they are attenuated around 60  dB and gives weak signals in the range of mV. A high gain preamplifier stage needs to amplify these weak signals and make them as strong signals. The preamplifier single stage needs to cascade for the gain requirement. The single stage preamplifier, which is designed with ST 65  nm technology, has an open loop gain of 24. 01  dB and close loop gain of 19. 43  dB. A flipped voltage follower (FVF) topology is used for designing this preamplifier to support the low supply voltage of 1  V because the topology supports low voltage, low noise and also low power consumption. The input-referred noise is 8. 69  nV/sqrt(Hz) and the SNR at the input are 73. 26  dB. The Schmitt trigger (comparator with hysteresis) is a bistable positive feedback circuit. It builds around two stage OTA with lead frequency compensation. The DC gain for this OTA is 26. 94  dB with 1  V supply voltage.

40|$|This paper explores {{understandings}} of the environment. It explores what the environment is and isn’t. The ultimate claim {{of this paper is}} that the environment is not an objective thing as language may trick us to believe and strategy textbooks would imply. Rather the environment is a field of entanglement which is enacted {{and the role of the}} business person is to make sense of the entanglement (Ingold, 2011; Smircich & Stubbart, 1985). This understanding is congruent with sustainable development that argues any consideration of the environment as being a separate thing is naive (WCED, 1987, p. xi). Thus the claim of this paper is that, if sustainable outcomes are desired then the key for individuals and corporate strategists in particular is to stop talking about the environment, trying to analyse it and or save it. Rather it is time to discuss strategy and organisations as meaning makers where <b>the</b> meaning is <b>human</b> <b>centric</b> and by extension humane for all of <b>the</b> <b>humans</b> on earth. To realise the above conclusion this paper will draw on four areas. These are (1) a discussion of how language can reify that which is a process, (2) a discussion of a potential model to understand humans not as things but as processes; (3) a review of definitions of the environment drawn from best selling strategy textbooks; and (4) some interview evidence on {{understandings of}} the environment from individuals who lead environmentally orientated organisations. These four areas could be considered a relative smorgasbord of ideas. However after moving through them the paper will try and synthesise the strands and summarise the implications. The key implication being that the environment does not exist as a separate thing and attempts to save it are naive. Thus if there is a desire to be sustainable and corporate strategists are key the viable position is to put humanity at the centre of considerations and in so doing rewrite strategy textbooks and theories therein. Prior to exploring the four areas, as a base to this paper, a vignette and a brief discussion of sustainable development and organisations are offered. Griffith Business SchoolFull Tex...|$|R

To achieve this goal, we conducted a pilot subjective user study simulating a video streaming service over a broadband network with varying distortion scenarios, namely packet losses (0, 0. 5, 1, 3, 7, and 15 %), packet reorder (0...|$|R
