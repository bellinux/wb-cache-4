5|$|A team {{typically}} {{consists of}} nine competitors: three honors, three scholastic and three varsity. However, since {{only the top}} two scores from each category count towards the team's total score, a team can compete with as few as six students without any point deduction. Students may compete in a higher category than the one they are assigned to, but generally {{it is to the}} students' advantage to compete in the lowest category they can. Scores in Varsity are typically lower <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> Scholastic, and those in Scholastic are typically lower <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> Honors.|$|E

Unaware that the Americans were swimming in 50yd pools, roughly 10% shorter <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> Australia, Tonelli could not understand his inability to match and better their times. He said that his greatest motivation was the desire to impress his parents.|$|E
5|$|M. l. leuconotus is {{endemic to}} {{mainland}} Australia and distinct {{in that it}} is the only subspecies to have nuptial males that show prominent blue-and-white plumage.

5|$|Successful mining {{took time}} and capital, {{particularly}} once {{most of the}} timber around the Klondike had been cut down. A realistic mining operation required $1,500 ($1.2 million) for wood to be burned to melt the ground, along with around $1,000 ($800,000) to construct a dam, $1,500 ($1.2 million) for ditches and up to $600 ($480,000) for sluice boxes, a total of $4,600. The attraction of the Klondike to a prospector, however, was that when gold was found, it was often highly concentrated. Some of the creeks in the Klondike were fifteen times richer in gold <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> California, and richer still <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> South Africa. In just two years, for example, $230,000 ($184 million) worth of gold was brought up from claim 29 on the Eldorado Creek.|$|E
5|$|The Jack Russell Terrier Club of America {{was formed}} in 1976 by Ailsa Crawford, {{one of the first}} Jack Russell terrier breeders in the United States. Size ranges for dogs were kept broad, with the ability of working dogs awarded higher <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> {{conformation}} shows. An open registry was maintained, with restricted line breeding. Registration for the club is made at adulthood for Jack Russells, rather than at birth, to ensure the breed's qualities remain, given the open registry.|$|E

5|$|The disease runs most {{rampant in}} the {{subtropical}} conditions which encourage reproduction of its mosquito vectors among which Culex tarsalis is most significant. Mortality rates {{appear to be}} higher <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> other birds, causing local population losses of up to 72% in a single season. Because of this, American crows are a sentinel species indicating the presence of West Nile virus in an area. Crows cannot transmit the virus to humans directly.|$|E

5|$|After {{assuming}} his new position, Treloar {{was sent}} to AIF Headquarters in the Middle East where Australian forces were engaged in the North African Campaign. While {{en route to the}} Middle East he visited Malaya. Conditions in North Africa proved more challenging <b>than</b> <b>those</b> <b>in</b> World War I, however, as the combat was fast-moving and the Australian troops felt less motivation to collect artefacts than those of the First AIF. Treloar was supported by a small staff, but fell out with his second in command who questioned both how he administered the unit and his personal efficiency. He also lacked a patron in the AIF and was handicapped by his relatively junior rank. Due to his absence from the Memorial, Treloar had only limited input into the design of its galleries and he was unable to attend its official opening in November 1941.|$|E
