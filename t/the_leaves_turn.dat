5|$|Planted bulbs are {{susceptible}} to nematodes, the most serious of which is Ditylenchus dipsaci (Narcissus eelworm), {{the main cause of}} basal plate disease in which <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>turn</b> yellow and become misshapen. Infested bulbs have to be destroyed; where infestation is heavy avoiding planting further narcissi for another five years. Other nematodes include Aphelenchoides subtenuis, which penetrates the roots causing basal plate disease and Pratylenchus penetrans (lesion nematode) the main cause of root rot in narcissi.|$|E
5|$|Narcissus {{plants have}} one to several basal leaves which are linear, ligulate or strap shaped (long and narrow), {{sometimes}} channelled adaxially to semiterete, and may (pedicellate) {{or may not}} (sessile) have a petiole stalk. The leaves are flat and broad to cylindrical at the base and arise from the bulb. The emerging plant generally has two leaves, but the mature plant usually three, rarely four, and they are covered with a cutin containing cuticle, giving them a waxy appearance. Leaf colour is light green to blue-green. In the mature plant the leaves extend higher than the flower stem, but in some species the leaves are low hanging. The leaf base is encased in a colourless sheath. After flowering <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>turn</b> yellow and die back once the seed pod (fruit) is ripe.|$|E
25|$|The {{leaves are}} alternate, simple, and {{oblanceolate}} with crenate margins and pinnate venation; in autumn <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>turn</b> a bold red color. Dark trichomes are {{present on the}} upper midrib surface. The flowers are small, with 5 petals and 5 sepals, and produced in corymbs of 10-25 together. Hypanthium is urn-shaped. The fruit is a small pome, with an astringent flavor.|$|E
50|$|Hakonechloa macra 'Beni-Kaze' <b>The</b> <b>leaves</b> of Beni-Kaze, (Japanese for Red Wind) {{are green}} {{throughout}} most of the growing season but as cool weather approaches red pigments flush into <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>turning</b> them bright red to reddish-purple in autumn.

25|$|Like most root crops, taro and eddoes {{do well in}} deep, moist or even swampy soils {{where the}} annual {{rainfall}} exceeds 2,500mm. Eddoes are more resistant to drought and cold. The crop attains maturity within six to twelve months after planting in dry-land cultivation and after twelve to fifteen months in wetland cultivation. The crop is harvested when the plant height decreases and <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>turn</b> yellow. These signals are usually less distinct in flooded taro cultivation.|$|E

During autumn, <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>turn</b> a bright yellow, then fall, sometimes within a short space of time (one to 15days).

60|$|It was {{characteristic}} of this man, {{who could be}} so hot over the lost causes of others, that, sitting there within {{half an hour of}} the final loss of his own cause, he could be so calm, so almost apathetic. This apathy was partly due to the hopelessness, which Nature had long perceived, of trying to make him feel oppressed, but also to the habits of a man incurably accustomed to carrying his fortunes in his hand, and that hand open. It did not seem real to him that he was actually going to suffer a defeat, to have to confess that he had hankered after this girl all these past weeks, and that to-morrow all would be wasted, and she as dead to him as if he had never seen her. No, it was not exactly resignation, it was rather sheer lack of commercial instinct. If only this had been the lost cause of another person. How gallantly he would have rushed to the assault, and taken her by storm! If only he himself could have been that other person, how easily, how passionately could he not have pleaded, letting forth from him all those words which had knocked at his teeth ever since he knew her, and which would have seemed so ridiculous and so unworthy, spoken on his own behalf. Yes, for that other person he could have cut her out from under the guns of the enemy; he could have taken her, that fairest prize. And in queer, cheery-looking apathy--not far removed perhaps from despair--he sat, watching <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>turn</b> over and fall, and now and then cutting with his stick at the air, where autumn was already riding. And, if in imagination he saw himself carrying her away into the wilderness, and with his devotion making her happiness to grow, it was so far a flight, that a smile crept about his lips, and once or twice he snapped his jaws.|$|E
