5|$|The battle {{began at}} 06:00 {{with the opening}} of the 102-gun French grand battery against the Russian center. Davout sent Compans's Division against the southernmost of the flèches, with Dessaix's Division echeloned out to the left. When Compans exited the woods on <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>bank</b> of the Kolocha, he was hit by massed Russian cannon fire; both Compans and Dessaix were wounded, but the French {{continued}} their assault.|$|E
5|$|The {{crossing}} was not {{secure and}} when the Germans realised something was happening they opened fire with machine-guns and targeted the south bank with artillery fire, sinking some boats or killing their crews. At dawn the evacuation ended with around 500 men still waiting on the north bank. A small number of men tried to swim across and some made it to <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>bank.</b> Of the men left behind, 200 evaded capture and reached {{the safety of the}} south bank over the following days.|$|E
5|$|On 19 and 20 October, the 4th Armoured Brigade was {{involved}} in its first action as a brigade in an attack towards the Savio River, with the 20th Armoured Regiment on the left flank. This was primarily a tank action, in contrast to previous battles in which the armour supported the infantry. Having advanced seven miles to complete its objectives, the regiment supported the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade in making its own attack across the river {{on the evening of}} 21 October. The regiment's Shermans fired an hour-long barrage of high explosive shells along their front to create a diversion, under the cover of which the Canadians made their own landings on <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>bank</b> of the Savio.|$|E

When the Witch-king rode into the water, Elrond, who {{controlled}} the river, released a flood that caught three Nazgûl and their horses. Glorfindel advanced and drove the terrified horses of the remaining Nazgûl into the flood. The horses drowned and all nine Nazgûl were swept away.|$|E
25|$|The 20th Brigade led the assault, {{with the}} 26th {{following}} them up while the 24th formed the divisional reserve. The 9th Division faced formidable natural barriers {{in the form}} of rivers swollen by recent rain. They came to a halt at the Busu River, which could not be bridged for two reasons: the 9th lacked heavy equipment, and <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>bank</b> was occupied by Japanese soldiers. On 9 September, the 2/28th Infantry Battalion led the attack across the Busu River and secured a bridgehead after fierce fighting.|$|E

25|$|When Scurry arrived, he {{deployed}} his regiment to Pyron's right, {{with the}} regimental artillery on the Confederate left. Although they had gained a numerical superiority, the Confederates were mostly armed with short range shotguns and pistols, which couldn't reach the Union positions three hundred yards away; the Confederate howitzers also couldn't reach the Union artillery on <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>bank</b> of the river. Meanwhile, Canby ordered {{most of the}} remaining garrison at Fort Craig to march to Valverde, leaving behind some militia to guard the fort. When he arrived, Canby moved most of his command, including the artillery, to the eastern bank, leaving the First New Mexico Volunteers under Carson and the Second New Mexico Volunteers under Colonel Miguel Piño on the western bank as a reserve.|$|E
25|$|Cassivellaunus {{realised}} {{he could}} not defeat Caesar in a pitched battle. Disbanding {{the majority of his}} force and relying on the mobility of his 4,000 chariots and superior knowledge of the terrain, he used guerrilla tactics to slow the Roman advance. By the time Caesar reached the Thames, the one fordable place available to him had been fortified with sharpened stakes, both on the shore and under the water, and <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>bank</b> was defended. Second Century sources state that Caesar used a large war elephant, which was equipped with armour and carried archers and slingers in its tower, to put the defenders to flight.

25|$|In the Battle of San Marcial on 31 August, Clausel's {{divisions}} {{crossed the}} Bidassoa River at dawn, covered by fog. After the mist cleared, the divisions of Taupin and Jean Barthélemy Darmagnac began pressing back William Inglis' British brigade and a Portuguese brigade. At 3:00 pm Clausel received Soult's order to withdraw {{just as a}} very heavy rainstorm began. By the time the retreating divisions reached the Bidassoa, the river was rising dangerously. The first brigades of both Taupin and Darmagnac got across but the second brigades became stranded on <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>bank</b> with Edmé-Martin Vandermaesen's division. Vandermaesen marched upstream to the bridge at Bera (Vera) and at 2:00 am on 1 September began making desperate attacks against the 100 British riflemen defending the span. The French finally dislodged the defenders and escaped, though Vandermaesen and many others were killed.|$|E

25|$|On May 29, Grant's army {{advanced}} southwest {{to confront}} Lee. Since {{most of his}} cavalry was occupied elsewhere, he decided to use infantry for a reconnaissance in force. Hancock's II Corps followed the RichmondHanovertown Road (also known as Atlee Station Road) to Totopotomoy Creek. Finding that Lee was firmly entrenched on <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>bank,</b> Hancock's men began digging in. Warren's V Corps extended the II Corps line to the left. Wright's VI Corps was sent northwest from Hanovertown toward Hanover Court House. Burnside's IX Corps was in reserve near Haw's Shop and Sheridan's Cavalry Corps was far to the Union left, near Old Church. The Confederate line, from left to right, consisted of the corps of A.P. Hill, Breckinridge's independent division, and the corps of Anderson and Early. No action beyond minor skirmishing occurred during the day.|$|E
25|$|As the Rajputs {{reached the}} middle of the creek, the Portuguese on Diu opened fire with two medium and two light machine-guns, {{capsizing}} some of the rafts. Major Mal Singh of the Indian Army along with five men pressed on his advance and crossed the creek. On reaching <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>bank,</b> he and his men assaulted the light machine gun trenches at Fort-De-Cova and silenced them. The Portuguese medium machine gun fire from another position wounded the officer and two of his men. However, with the efforts of company Havildar Major Mohan Singh and two other men, the three wounded were evacuated back across the creek to safety. As dawn approached, the Portuguese increased the intensity of fire and the battalion's water crossing equipment suffered extensive damage. As a result, the Indian battalion was ordered to fall back to Kob village by first light.|$|E
25|$|As a {{fifth-generation}} Texan, Lair {{never lost}} his childhood accent. He was raised as an only child, although eventually {{he would come}} to have two younger sisters, and he grew up poor, quiet, and shy. His imagination sparked by his reading, he dreamt of becoming a pilot. He was a seventeen-year-old freshman at Texas A when the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred. Anxious to defend his nation, he applied for naval pilot's training, but was rejected because of substandard eyesight. He then convinced his mother to cosign his enlistment papers into the U.S. Army as a private. He saw his first combat in the invasion of Normandy. His armored unit fought its way across Europe for the next year. Lair's unit ended World War II on the Elbe River, facing a Russian unit on <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>bank.</b> It was there that Lair became convinced the American army should have continued the war, and defeated the communists.|$|E

25|$|At Troyes, Schwarzenberg's 90,000 {{troops and}} Blücher's 50,000 faced about 75,000 {{soldiers}} under Napoleon. Though he outnumbered the French emperor by nearly two-to-one, Schwarzenberg's intelligence services consistently overestimated enemy strength. His troops had worn-out uniforms and were short {{of food in}} an area that had been stripped of supplies by both armies. On 22 February the French probed the Allied positions from Méry to Troyes. Marshal Nicolas Oudinot's infantry cleared Méry of Allied troops and gained a foothold on <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>bank,</b> but they could not hold it against Allied counterattacks. In this clash, 3,600 men from Pierre François Joseph Boyer's division fought against 5,000 Russians from Alexei Grigorievich Scherbatov's VI Infantry Corps of Fabian Wilhelm von Osten-Sacken's command and 1,200 Prussians from Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg's I Corps. That night Schwarzenberg directed his army to withdraw behind the Seine River, except for Ignaz Gyulai's III Corps, which would move southeast to Bar-sur-Seine.|$|E
25|$|In May, Habert {{received}} a rude introduction to guerilla warfare when Colonel Perena led his militia in chasing out the French garrison of Monzón. Desiring {{to recapture the}} town, Habert sent a force consisting of about 1,000 men from his elite companies plus some cuirassiers across the Cinca River downstream from Monzón. However, the river flooded without warning, trapping his detachment on <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>bank.</b> With {{the rest of his}} troops Habert attempted to cross at Monzón itself, but Perena's men repelled all his assaults on 16 May. The cavalry swam their horses across the river and escaped. But the isolated foot soldiers ran out of ammunition and were forced to surrender on 19 May as Habert watched helplessly. In this action, Habert commanded Junot's 1st Division of 9,000 troops and 12 guns, with two squadrons of the 13th Cuirassier Regiment attached. Perena's estimated 10,000 Miqueletes captured three voltiguer (light) companies of the 14th Line Infantry Regiment, the grenadier and voltiguer companies of the 116th Line Infantry Regiment, and possibly other units.|$|E
25|$|The narrow, fast-flowing rivers were {{strewn with}} sandbars and shallowly covered rocks. Each year these could change {{position}} dramatically {{during the spring}} thaw when the river was high with meltwater; throughout {{the remainder of the}} season they kept moving, albeit more slowly. These conditions meant that even for a vessel specifically designed for the Yukon navigation was still beset by hazards, and the SS Keno did not escape mishap. On 8 June 1927 she hit a submerged rock on the Yukon River's Big Bend, south of Whitehorse, and sank. She was raised, repaired and re-entered service. In 1933, while working on the Thirtymile River stretch of the Yukon River, the Keno was severely damaged when the barge she was pushing partially ran aground on a bend. The barge dug in, and caused the Keno to swing in the river which brought her stern in contact with <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>bank.</b> The consequent impact smashed the Keno paddlewheel and broke off her rudders.
