5|$|A {{small number}} of motte-and-bailey castles were built outside of {{northern}} Europe. In the late-12th century, the Normans invaded southern Italy and Sicily; although they had the technology to build more modern designs, in many cases wooden motte-and-bailey castles were built instead for reasons of speed. The Italians came {{to refer to a}} range of different castle types as motta, however, and <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> have been as many genuine motte-and-bailey castles in southern Italy as was once thought {{on the basis of the}} documentary evidence alone. In addition, there is evidence of the Norman crusaders building a motte and bailey using sand and wood in Egypt in 1221 during the Fifth Crusade.|$|E
5|$|Also if {{assuming}} a radius of one AU, then <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be sufficient building {{material in the}} Solar System to construct a Dyson shell. Anders Sandberg estimates that there is 1.82 kg of easily usable building material in the Solar System, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of 600kg/m2—about 8–20cm thick on average, depending on {{the density of the}} material. This includes the hard-to-access cores of the gas giants; the inner planets alone provide only 11.79 kg, enough for a 1-AU shell with a mass of just 42kg/m2.|$|E
5|$|L. ahuacaense {{is known}} only from Cerro El Ahuaca, a steep granite inselberg near Cariamanga in Loja Province, {{southern}} Ecuador, where it occurs {{at an altitude}} of , but only near rocky surfaces. The vegetation is dominated by the molasses grass (Melinis minutiflora). They eat plants, and traces of their feeding are visible on the mountain. Their habitat on Cerro El Ahuaca covers an area around , and the total population <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> contain more than a few dozen individuals. Except for some small outcrops close to the Cerro, no nearby habitat is suitable, but more populations may exist elsewhere in southern Ecuador or nearby northern Peru.|$|E

5|$|Tooth {{abnormalities}} may {{be categorized}} {{according to whether}} they have environmental or developmental causes. While environmental abnormalities may appear to have an obvious cause, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> appear to be any known cause for some developmental abnormalities. Environmental forces may affect teeth during development, destroy tooth structure after development, discolor teeth at any stage of development, or alter the course of tooth eruption. Developmental abnormalities most commonly affect the number, size, shape, and structure of teeth.|$|E
5|$|The fur is {{brownish}} (T.bolivaris) or reddish (T.talamancae) {{above and}} lighter below, appearing whitish, but {{the hairs on}} the underparts have gray bases. The snout is large. The mystacial (above the mouth) and superciliary vibrissae both extend to at least the back margin of the ears when laid back against the head, but are much longer in T.bolivaris. The pinna (external ear) is large. On the hindfeet, which are long and narrow, ungual tufts of hairs surround the bases of the toes. In T.bolivaris, the sole usually entirely lacks squamae (small, scale-like structures), but T.talamancae does have squamae on part of its sole. The claw of the first toe extends about {{to the middle of}} the first phalange of the second and that of the fifth toe extends nearly to the base of the second phalange of the fourth. The tail is at least about as long as the head and body, sometimes slightly longer. The tail is darker above than below in T.talamancae, but <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be a difference in color in T.bolivaris. The tail appears naked, but is covered with fine hairs.|$|E
5|$|The {{survival}} {{of this species}} is tied closely to rainfall because of the susceptibility of seedlings to drought. It is thus especially vulnerable {{to the effects of}} climate change. This was recognised as early as 1992, when it was noted that winter rainfall in the Quairading region had been falling by about 4% per decade, and that a continuation of this trend may reduce the species' distribution. Recently, a more thorough assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to extinction, and mild change to a reduction of its range by 80% by 2080. However, <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> be any range reduction at all under mid-severity climate change, depending on how effectively this species can migrate into newly habitable areas.|$|E
