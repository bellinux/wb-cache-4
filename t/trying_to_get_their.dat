5|$|Having {{believed}} {{that they would be}} participating in Russian's television programme for an entire year, most contestants had given up their homes, jobs and partners—most had to find new employment and some were forced to move in with their parents. Russian went into hiding and was unable to be reached by his victims. On 13 June 2002, Debbie Leigh Driver, one of Russian's contestants, contacted Caz Gorham and Frances Dickenson of the independent production company Christmas TV & Film and told them about the hoax. Gorham and Dickenson produced a genuine TV programme to document the story of the con and how the participants were now <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> lives back together, which was shown on Channel 4 in December 2002.|$|E
5|$|In Paris, Bizet {{discovered}} the difficulties faced by young and relatively unknown composers <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> operas performed. Of the capital's two state-subsidised opera houses, the Opéra and the , the former offered a static repertoire in which works by foreign composers, particularly Rossini and Meyerbeer, were dominant. Even established French composers such as Gounod had difficulty getting works performed there. At the Opéra-Comique, innovation was equally rare; although more French works were performed, {{the style and}} character of most productions had hardly changed since the 1830s. However, one condition of the Opéra-Comique's state funding was that {{from time to time}} it should produce one-act works by former Prix de Rome laureates. Under this provision, Bizet wrote La guzla de l'Emir, with a libretto by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré, and this went into rehearsal early in 1862.|$|E
5|$|Walsh {{identified}} drinks as {{the central}} Diageo business, and began selling off assets that did not fit this model. He sold Pillsbury to General Mills in 2001 for $10.1 billion, and Burger King to the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in 2002 for $1.5 billion. He suggested {{that he would have}} liked to have sold Burger King earlier, but was worried about Diageo's capacity to handle both transactions simultaneously. In a strategy to bolster Diageo's drinks sales, in 2001 he acquired the Seagram drinks business from Vivendi Universal in conjunction with Pernod Ricard for $8.2 billion, an action that was later credited with refocusing and re-energising Diageo. At the time, analysts suggested that Walsh had overpaid, and that Pernod Ricard had gained control of the better brands. Despite having entered into an alliance with Pernod in order to avoid regulatory issues, Diageo was still forced to divest the Malibu Rum brand after acquiring Captain Morgan. Walsh defended the deal on the basis of efficiency savings and the fact that the deal was almost entirely financed by the sale of Pillsbury. Of the acquisition he says:We moved in on that Seagram deal and forced their hand very quickly while our competitors were still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> act together. If you look at what we paid it will go down in history as the bargain of the century. It was an $8.1bn total price of which our part was about $5.6bn and it was at economic profit break even at the end of year two. It’s produced phenomenal returns. If you look at Pernod’s Allied Domecq acquisition, it is 30 per cent higher in multiple terms and you’re not getting as good a collection of brands.|$|E

In 1984, both novels were re-published in both countries (Viking Books publishing in the US), this time under one cover, with the title The Diaries of Jane Somers: The Diary of a Good Neighbour and If the Old Could, listing Doris Lessing as author.|$|E

500|$|In {{writing a}} musical about film making in Hollywood, Sparks were also {{informed}} {{by their own}} past film projects. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, they had spent six years <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> film Mai, the Psychic Girl produced. Based on a Japanese manga comic, the film was at one time supposed to be directed by Tim Burton. Although the music had been completed, the film failed to materialise, an experience that coloured their portrayal of the studio head in The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman. Earlier, Sparks had worked with French director Jacques Tati on Confusion, another film project that remained uncompleted. Having had numerous meetings with Tati {{over the course of}} a year, they were aware that, like other great European directors, Tati had been wooed by Hollywood: [...] "He showed me a letter from Paramount", Ron Mael recalled. [...] "He said: 'Oooh! They take me to Hollywood and they have a limousine for me.' But it was kind of mocking of the whole similar situation to our fantasy Bergman thing.

500|$|The one reel comedy, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on August 26, 1910. The film likely saw a wide national release, advertisements in theaters are known in Indiana, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. The New York Dramatic Mirror gave the most detailed review of the trade publications by summing up the scenario and approving of the plot and the good acting in the production. The reviewer concluded, [...] "Not only are the leading roles well portrayed, but the minor parts are quite well done in the picture - the dismissed stenographer and the old landlady actually look and act their parts. There is a pleasing, symmetrical competence in the whole cast." [...] The production was reviewed positively by The Moving Picture World and concludes with the statement, [...] "The story ends there without a suspicion of anybody {{falling in love with}} anybody else, a restraint which will be duly appreciated." [...] Bower's notes that many Thanhouser plots conclude with the romance and the reviewer noted this change was a welcome one for this production.

500|$|Bandslam {{was bought}} by a studio back in 2004, but in late January 2007, Walden Media and Summit Entertainment {{announced}} that they would co-finance Bandslam, co-written by Todd Graff and Josh A. Cagan and directed by Graff. Graff was hired to direct in early March 2007 and rewrote the screenplay. Before filming, they had two weeks of music rehearsals. The actors and actresses were designated to play their instruments. Donowho and Michalka had extensive experience with the drums and guitar, respectively, so {{they were used to}} their instruments, but Lisa Chung, Scott Porter and Vanessa Hudgens were not. Hudgens told MTV News she didn't expect there to be as much music, and [...] "they are like, 'We are going to have two weeks of music rehearsals,' and I was like, 'What?' But it was really cool. It's definitely not the kind of music I do normally." [...] Principal photography began on February 9, 2008 in Austin, Texas. Although the film is set in New Jersey, Graff felt strongly {{that it was important to}} shoot in a place with a wide array of great live music to choose from. [...] "I'm a big believer in local scenes," [...] he says. [...] "I think it's the lifeblood of music. Austin is renowned as a music town, and rightly so. They have a ton of really great bands just <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> music out there. So, it's great we had an opportunity to use several unsigned local Texas bands." [...] In an interview with Los Angeles Times, director Todd Graff admitted there were cultural incongruities underlying the film. [...] "I know, it's demented. Every once in a while on set I would think to myself, 'I can't believe we got away with this'. I always thought if it only sent one kid to listen to a Velvet Underground record, it would be worth it to me." [...] All of the vocals were filmed live by each of the singing cast members, as mentioned by director Graff. One of the requirements for the film was that all actors had to be able to provide their own vocals. Because Aly Michalka was on tour with her sister AJ Michalka and Miley Cyrus, she did not arrive in Austin until midway through rehearsals. Conveniently, the tour's last stop was in Austin, where rehearsal and filming for the movie took place. All of the instruments and singing in the movie were recorded by the actors, with the exception of the guitar parts of Vanessa Hudgens and Scott Porter, as well as Lisa Chung's piano parts. Although Hudgens and Porter learned how to play their songs, they were dubbed by guitarists Jason Mozersky and JW Wright.|$|E

[...] He also mentioned that despite claims by the organizers that their sales would [...] "sky rocket just because [...] were in the HIB3", their actual amount of sales remained relatively constant. Zubov noted that their inclusion in the third bundle [...] "did get a lot of users who redeemed their copy of Steel Storm on Steam and Desura" [...] and that they hoped this would help keep their [...] "current user base, which we gained with HIB3, interested in our upcoming games". He concluded his comments about his experiences by saying that [...] "only time will tell if HIB3 was [...] awesome deal or not. Maybe, maybe not.

2500|$|In a New York City park, hippies have {{gathered}} with guitars to sing protest songs. Fritz {{and his buddies}} show up {{in an attempt to}} meet girls. When a trio of attractive females walk by, Fritz and his friends exhaust themselves <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> attention, but find that the girls are more interested in the crow standing a few feet away. The girls attempt to flirt with the crow, making unintentionally condescending remarks about blacks, while Fritz looks on in annoyance. Suddenly, the crow rebukes the girls with a snide remark, indicates that he is gay and walks away. Fritz invites the girls to [...] "seek the truth", bringing them up to his friend's apartment, where a wild party is taking place. Since the other rooms are crowded, Fritz drags the girls into the bathroom and the four of them have group sex in the bathtub. Meanwhile, the police (portrayed as pigs) arrive to raid the party. As the two officers walk up the stairs, one of the party-goers finds Fritz and the girls in the bath tub. Several others jump in, pushing Fritz to the side where he takes solace in marijuana. The two officers break into the apartment, but find that it is empty because everyone has moved into the bathroom. Fritz takes refuge in the toilet when one of the pigs enters the bathroom and begins to beat up the partygoers. As the pig becomes exhausted, a very stoned Fritz jumps out, grabs the pig's gun, and shoots the toilet, causing the water main to break and flooding everybody out of the apartment. The pigs chase Fritz down the street into a synagogue. Fritz manages to escape when the congregation gets up to celebrate the United States' decision to send more weapons into Israel.|$|E
2500|$|It {{originally}} required motorists {{to pay for}} the towing {{of their}} stalled vehicle, but at reduced prices set by the city. Tow truck drivers claimed that the program hurt their business and nine wrecker companies filed lawsuits against the city. White testified in court in the case. In addition the SafeClear Program has been blamed for causing the deaths of people, who seemed to be <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> cars off the freeway without having to pay fees to the tow truck drivers. The cause of death of these people, however, is uncertain. State Senator John Whitmire recruited 30 out of 31 Texas State Senators' votes to make the SafeClear program illegal. White responded to the controversy and criticism by changing the rules of the program and the towing laws, including free towing for limited distances funded by the city. The program was adapted to include strict licensing of SafeClear wreckers including criminal background checks, allowing the towed motorist to be towed for one mile for free, preventing the City leasing stretches of state-owned highway to private wrecker companies, and requiring revenue generated from the program to enter a mobility fund. White also worked with John Whitmire to address the objections of the senators, keeping the program alive but in a different format. He also rode with a wrecker and conducted several studies of the program. Despite the controversy, independent studies have found that the program has helped. Studies show that the program has been successful in decreasing accidents. A study, conducted by Rice University and Texas A University found that the number of freeway crashes decreased by 10.4%, [...] or nearly 2,000 crashes. According to these results, drivers in Houston saved approximately $35 million by the implementation of the program. However Suzanne Poole, president of the Houston Professional Towing Association, says those numbers are misleading and actual crashes are actually higher. In reference to the program's objective to decrease traffic congestion, a study by KHOU-TV found that average drive times increased at 86% of freeways into Houston six months after the program was implemented compared to before the program. However, some claim that more cars were on the roads during these six months and that construction on the freeways, particularly on US 59, caused drive times to increase. Nonetheless, SafeClear remained one of the most controversial, and one of few controversies, during his time as mayor.|$|E
