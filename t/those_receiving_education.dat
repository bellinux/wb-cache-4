40|$|Excerpt] Howe and Strauss (2007) propound {{the theory}} {{that there is a}} clear nexus between the {{significant}} events youth face and their attitudes in later life. This is relevant in looking at the evolution of industrial relations, especially in Sri Lanka. One could say that the historical context of Sri Lanka has {{played a major role in}} the current behaviour of management and labour—from the nationalist revival in 1956 and the culture change which gripped the country until the insurgency of 1971 which can be identified as the coming to a head of the frustrations created in relation to emancipated, educated youth who had no prospects of proper employment. The language policy introduced under the cultural revolution created a hostile divide between the English-speaking managers, who in colonial times and for several decades thereafter came from elite schools, and the ‘swabasha’ 1 educated workers. Since the language of management and business transactions continued to be English, it was difficult for <b>those</b> <b>receiving</b> <b>education</b> in the local languages to claim higher positions in the private sector although often they were better technically qualified, at least on paper, than the English- peaking candidates selected. With educated youth finding that they could not access the higher echelons without English the obvious reaction was to resent the language as well as the system which used it. The policy in the government was to use the swabasha for official transactions and this led to graduates educated by local universities moving mostly into public sector management positions, seldom securing employment in the private sector. The tension created by Sinhala-educated youth not having adequate access to jobs compatible with their education led to the insurrection in 1971. The youth of that era are now mature citizens and legislators and are therefore anxious to give fair opportunity to youth coming into the labour market by helping them acquire language skills needed for employment...|$|E

The figure is {{alarming}} and immediate action is required to stop this scourge. This study was carried out to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice about rabies among children attending primary schools located in the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) premises and those outside the university as well as <b>those</b> <b>receiving</b> informal <b>education.</b> The participants {{for this study were}} children drawn by random selection from the schools chosen by purposive sampling. With the aid of questionnaires, information was obtained from a total of 477 children with 400 from formal educational settings among 3 schools, and 77 from quaranic schools (almajiris) in the informal setting. More children <b>receiving</b> formal <b>education</b> were aware about the disease (50. 8 %) than <b>those</b> <b>receiving</b> informal <b>education</b> (32. 5 %), likewise those residing within ABU quarters (71 %) were better informed than those residing outside ABU quarters (43. 3 %). Among children in the formal schools, 25. 9 % obtained information from friends and at school (25. 9 %), while in the informal setting, 56 % obtained information from friends and only 16 % from school. With regards to attitude and practice, 75. 5 % of children <b>receiving</b> formal <b>education</b> came from homes where dogs were vaccinated against rabies and 23. 3 % of them play with dogs they know, while 11. 1 % of <b>those</b> <b>receiving</b> informal <b>education</b> vaccinate their dogs and fewer of them (14. 3 %) play with dogs known to them. Many children (65. 7 %) of those in formal schools know the role of dogs in rabies transmission, compared to only 8 % in the informal schools. However, only 9. 7 % of children in formal schools associate both signs of furious and dumb form of rabies with the disease, compared with 28 % in informal schools.  Among children bitten by dogs, 87. 5 % of <b>those</b> <b>receiving</b> informal <b>education</b> <b>received</b> hospital treatment compared to 63. 7 % of those going to formal schools.

40|$|AbstractThe {{paper is}} an attempt to analyse up to what extent free {{education}} can reduce households’ burden of private expenditure on education. Such an analysis is important in current government policy drive of reducing subsidies from social sectors and providing targeted free education to poor. Logically the social need of students availing free education is fulfilled by government so they are relieved from the risk of impoverishment due to high private expenditure. But analysis on NSSO data on Participation and Expenditure on Education, 2007 - 08 reveals that free educations is availed only at elementary level and at that level also free education is not universal. In the first part the distribution of free education has been discussed at each level of education, MPCE class and state. Next the average cost of <b>education</b> for students <b>receiving</b> free <b>education</b> and students’ not <b>receiving</b> free <b>education</b> has been calculated to compare up to what extent free education exempts students from private expenditure. Lastly the comparative share of each item of education to total expenditure has been analysed for each state to understand the particular item that is responsible for most of the expenditure on households. It has been observed that although the cost of <b>education</b> of <b>those</b> <b>receiving</b> free <b>education</b> is lower than <b>those</b> <b>receiving</b> paid <b>education</b> but in absolute terms there is significant expenditure on education by the households. Above school level free education is almost inexistent and expenditure on education is incurred on all consumption expenditure quartiles. Therefore even the poor households have a proportion of expenditure going to education as students either do not <b>receive</b> free <b>education</b> or do not get it absolutely free. Item wise break up of expenditure showed that free education relieves a household only from paying tuition fees. There are other important items of consumption like books, stationery, uniform and most importantly private tuition consumed by students in all MPCE quartiles and paid for by households. Quality of educational institutions have to be improved so that private tuition does not remain a necessity and overall education from primary to highest level have to be provided by the government to relieve households from expenditure burden...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Ultrasound is {{recommended}} to guide insertion of peripheral intravenous vascular cannulae (PIVC) where difficulty is experienced. Ultrasound machines are now common-place and junior doctors are often {{expected to be}} able to use them. The educational standards for this skill are highly varied, ranging from no education, to self-guided internet-based education, to formal, face-to-face traditional education. In an attempt to decide which educational technique our institution should introduce, a small pilot trial comparing educational techniques was designed. Methods: Thirty medical students were enrolled and allocated to one of three groups. PIVC placing ability was then observed, tested and graded on vascular access phantoms. Results: The formal, face-to-face traditional education was rated best by the students, and had the highest success rate in PIVC placement, the improvement statistically significant compared to no education (p = 0. 01) and trending towards significance when compared to self-directed internet-based education (p< 0. 06).

This study investigated hospitalised patients' experiences of health education for smoking, alcohol use, diet, physical activity, and weight, and their views concerning the appropriateness of hospitals as a setting for the delivery of health education services. Methods Recently discharged adult hospital patients (n = 322) were sent a questionnaire asking about their smoking, alcohol use, diet, physical activity, and weight. For each of these risk factors, participants were asked whether they agreed with screening for the risk factor, whether they <b>received</b> health <b>education,</b> whether it was "helpful", and {{if they wanted to}} change their behaviour. Participants were also asked a set of general questions concerning health education within hospitals. Results 190 patients responded (59 %). Over 80 % agreed with screening for all risk factors. 80 % of smokers, 52 % consuming alcohol above recommended limits, 86 % of obese, 66 % consuming less than five fruit and vegetables a day, and 61 % of physically inactive participants wanted to change their respective behaviour. However only a third reported <b>receiving</b> health <b>education.</b> While over 60 % of patients wanted health education around discharge, the majority of <b>those</b> <b>receiving</b> health <b>education</b> did so at admission. The majority agreed that "hospital is a good place for patients to receive" health education (87 %) and that "the hospital should provide patients with details of community organisations that provide" health education (83 %). Only a minority (31 %) reported a preference for health education from their GP instead of hospital. Conclusion While the delivery of health education to patients within hospital was poor, hospitals are viewed by patients as an appropriate, and in some cases preferred setting for the screening of risk factors and delivery of health education. </p...|$|R
