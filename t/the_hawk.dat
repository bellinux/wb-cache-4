5|$|A study, using stuffed bird models, {{found that}} small birds {{are less likely}} to {{approach}} common cuckoos (a brood parasite) which have barred underparts like the Eurasian sparrowhawk. Eurasian reed warblers were found to be more aggressive to cuckoos which looked less hawk-like, meaning that the resemblance to <b>the</b> <b>hawk</b> helps the cuckoo to access the nests of potential hosts.|$|E
5|$|In {{an early}} account, Sophocles wrote that Tereus {{was turned into}} a large-beaked bird whom some {{scholars}} translate as a hawk while a number of retellings and other works (including Aristophanes' ancient comedy, The Birds) hold that Tereus was instead changed into a hoopoe. Various later translations of Ovid state that Tereus was transformed into other birds than <b>the</b> <b>hawk</b> and hoopoe, including references by Dryden and Gower to the lapwing.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of publication, Vachss worked as an attorney, in New York City, specializing in child abuse cases; {{he also had a}} career as a novelist. The duality of Vachss' work as a lawyer prosecuting and {{defending}} real cases and as a crime fiction author writing about fictional criminals resulted in Vachss being compared to the Bruce Wayne/Batman character. Vachss' eighth novel, Footsteps of <b>the</b> <b>Hawk,</b> in the Burke series featuring a vigilante private investigator of child abuse cases, was released just two months before the publication of Batman: The Ultimate Evil. He had wanted to approach the topic of sex tourism in southeast Asia, but had been unable to find a way for the Burke character to go there; the Batman character offered the chance for him to write about the topic.|$|E
5|$|In {{its current}} role No.79 Squadron's main {{responsibility}} is to provide introductory fast jet training to pilots who have recently graduated from No.2 Flying Training School. During this training, new pilots who have been selected to fly jet aircraft are taught to operate Hawks and provided with initial instruction on jet aircraft combat tactics. In 2004, each of No.79 Squadron's training courses lasted for twelve weeks. After completing their initial jet aircraft training, pilots transfer to No.76 Squadron at RAAF Base Williamtown for advanced instruction before being posted {{to one of the}} RAAF's operational conversion units. No.79 Squadron also provides introductory training on fast jets for RAAF air combat officers who have been selected to serve on board F/A-18F Super Hornets. The squadron trained RAAF personnel selected to serve as navigators on board F-111 strike aircraft until these aircraft were replaced with Super Hornets in 2010.

In a more grim case, the terms war dove and war hawk have been re-purposed as labels for two opposing political factions divided over the ongoing mutual hostility between birds and the human minority: the altruistic Dove Party, who advocate for cooperation and peace between the two groups, and the militant Hawk Party, whose goal is to exterminate humanity altogether. By the time Hatoful Boyfriends narrative begins, the Dove Party, <b>the</b> <b>Hawk</b> Party, and their respective schools of thought dominate much of the world's politics.|$|E
5|$|This nuthatch's {{responses}} to predators {{may be linked}} to a reproductive strategy. A study compared the white-breasted nuthatch with the red-breasted nuthatch in terms of the willingness of males to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of predators. The models were of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, and a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with <b>the</b> <b>hawk.</b> This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities, while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{returned}} with <b>The</b> <b>Hawk</b> Is Dying (2007), also starring Michael Pitt. It {{tells the story}} of George (played by Paul Giamatti), trying to find meaning in his life by training a wild red-tailed hawk. Williams portrayed Pitt's girlfriend, the only person who understands George's growing obsession. The film earned $7,000 domestically playing at one theater. Five months after giving birth, Williams was back, appearing in The Hottest State, a film by Ethan Hawke, adapted from his 1996 book. Critics panned it for being too pretentious and self-aware. Variety writer Leslie Felperin believed the film underused Williams as a former lover of one of the main characters. It did a limited theatrical run beginning August 24, ultimately grossing $137,340. Williams played Edie Sedgwick, muse of Andy Warhol, {{as a part of the}} biographical ensemble piece I'm Not There, inspired by the musician Bob Dylan.|$|E

5|$|For the few {{species on}} which data are available, the average {{nuthatch}} lifespan {{in the wild}} is between 2 and 3.5years, although ages of up to 10 years have been recorded. The Eurasian nuthatch has an adult annual survival rate of 53% and the male Corsican nuthatch 61.6%. Nuthatches and other small woodland birds share the same predators: accipiters, owls, squirrels and woodpeckers. An American study showed that nuthatch responses to predators {{may be linked to}} reproductive strategies. It measured the willingness of males of two species to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, or a house wren, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with <b>the</b> <b>hawk.</b> This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.|$|E
5|$|In the {{improved}} vigilance effect, groups {{are able to}} detect predators sooner than solitary individuals. For many predators, success depends on surprise. If the prey is alerted early in an attack, they have an improved chance of escape. For example, wood pigeon flocks are preyed upon by goshawks. Goshawks are less successful when attacking larger flocks of wood pigeons than they are when attacking smaller flocks. This is because the larger the flock size, {{the more likely it}} is that one bird will notice <b>the</b> <b>hawk</b> sooner and fly away. Once one pigeon flies off in alarm, the rest of the pigeons follow. Wild ostriches in Tsavo National Park in Kenya feed either alone or in groups of up to four birds. They are subject to predation by lions. As the ostrich group size increases, the frequency at which each individual raises it head to look for predators decreases. Because ostriches are able to run at speeds that exceed those of lions for great distances, lions try to attack an ostrich when its head is down. By grouping, the ostriches present the lions with greater difficulty in determining how long the ostriches' heads stay down. Thus, although individual vigilance decreases, the overall vigilance of the group increases.|$|E
5|$|The {{cane toad}} was {{introduced}} into New Guinea to control <b>the</b> <b>hawk</b> moth larvae eating sweet potato crops. The first release occurred in 1937 using toads imported from Hawaii, {{with a second}} release the same year using specimens from the Australian mainland. Evidence suggests a third release in 1938, consisting of toads being used for human pregnancy testsmany species of toad {{were found to be}} effective for this task, and were employed for about 20years after the discovery was announced in 1948. Initial reports argued the toads were effective in reducing the levels of cutworms and sweet potato yields were thought to be improving. As a result, these first releases were followed by further distributions across much of the region, although their effectiveness on other crops, such as cabbages, has been questioned; when the toads were released at Wau, the cabbages provided insufficient shelter and the toads rapidly left the immediate area for the superior shelter offered by the forest. A similar situation had previously arisen in the Australian cane fields, but this experience was either unknown or ignored in New Guinea. The cane toad has since become abundant in rural and urban areas.|$|E

40|$|When a {{black hole}} is in an empty space on {{which there is no}} matter field except that of <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> {{radiation}} (<b>Hawking</b> field), then <b>the</b> black hole evaporates and the entropy of the black hole decreases. The generalised second law guarantees the increase of the total entropy of the whole system which consists of the black hole and <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field. That is, the increase of the entropy of <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field is faster than the decrease of the black hole entropy. In naive sense, one may expect that the entropy increase of <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field is due to the self-interaction among the composite particles of <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field, and that the "self"-relaxation of <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field results in the entropy increase. Then, when one consider a non-self-interacting matter field as <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field, {{it is obvious that the}} self-relaxation does not take place, and one may think that the total entropy does not increase. However, using nonequilibrium thermodynamics which has been developed recently, we find for <b>the</b> non-self-interacting <b>Hawking</b> field that <b>the</b> rate of entropy increase of <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field (<b>the</b> entropy emission rate by the black hole) grows faster than the rate of entropy decrease of the black hole along the black hole evaporation in the empty space. The origin of the entropy increase of <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field is <b>the</b> increase of the black hole temperature. Hence an understanding of the generalised second law in the context of the nonequilibrium thermodynamics is suggested; even if the self-relaxation of <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field does not take place, the temperature increase of the black hole during the evaporation process causes the entropy increase of <b>the</b> <b>Hawking</b> field to result in the increase of the total entropy.
