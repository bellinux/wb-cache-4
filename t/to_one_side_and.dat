5|$|Lea {{took him}} <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> {{informed}} {{him of the}} charges, but Corder denied all knowledge of both Maria and the crime. A search of the house uncovered a pair of pistols supposedly bought {{on the day of}} the murder, some letters from a Mr Gardener, which may have contained warnings about the discovery of the crime, and a passport from the French ambassador, evidence which suggested that Corder may have been preparing to flee.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{may also}} occur in {{someone who is}} receiving mechanical ventilation, in which case {{it may be difficult}} to spot as the person is typically receiving sedation; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition. Recent studies have shown that the development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> the presence of raised jugular venous pressure (distended neck veins) are not reliable as clinical signs.|$|E
5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing {{her head on his}} torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E

50|$|A less {{frequently}} used strategy is <b>to</b> solve <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>one</b> rim first, then the 2nd, 3rd and 4th rim, {{and finally the}} last <b>side</b> <b>and</b> rim. That is, like building a building. First the basement, then each floor, and finally the roof.|$|R
5|$|Pandora Crowned by the Seasons is {{an unusual}} composition, painted to {{resemble}} a bas-relief in which the different elements are emerging from a flat background. The figure of Pandora stands in the centre, with Vulcan <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> Venus and Cupid to the other, each leaning away from her; the figures of Vulcan and Venus, along with the four figures representing the seasons in the upper corners of the canvas, create a diamond shape around Pandora. The foot of Vulcan rests upon the picture frame, a favourite device of Rubens; elements of the picture's composition are also taken from an 1817 engraving on the same subject, drawn by Etty's fellow York artist John Flaxman and engraved by William Blake. As with all Etty's history paintings from this time on, he worked by painting the figures first, and only filling in the background once the figures were complete.|$|E
5|$|John Wilkes Booth had {{originally}} planned to kidnap Lincoln, and recruited conspirators, including Lewis Powell. Having found {{no opportunity to}} abduct the president, on April 14, 1865, Booth assigned Powell to assassinate Seward, with George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Johnson and himself to kill Lincoln, which would slay the three {{senior members of the}} Executive Branch. Accordingly, another member of the conspiracy, David Herold, led Powell to the Seward home on horseback and was responsible for holding Powell's horse while he committed the attack. Seward had been hurt in an accident some days before, and Powell gained entry to the home on the excuse he was delivering medicine to the injured man, but was stopped {{at the top of the}} stairs by Frederick Seward, who insisted Powell give him the medicine. Powell instead attempted to fire on Frederick, and beat him over the head with the barrel of his gun when it misfired. Powell burst through the door, threw Fanny Seward (the secretary's daughter) <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> jumped on the bed, and stabbed William Seward in the face and neck five times. A soldier assigned to guard and nurse the secretary, Private George F. Robinson, jumped on Powell, forcing him from the bed. Powell fled, stabbing a messenger, Emerick Hansell, as he went, to find that Herold, panicked by the screams from the house, had left with both horses. Seward was at first thought dead, but revived enough to instruct Robinson to send for the police and lock the house until they arrived.|$|E

25|$|When on the nest, the {{majority}} of the wasps spend their time resting. This posture usually includes holding the abdomen <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> individuals will often lie {{on top of each other}} while resting.

25|$|When an {{individual}} of L. vechti feels threatened, it will assume a menacing stance by bending its abdomen <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> pointing the tip {{in the direction}} of its challenger. It does this so that it is prepared to sting its opponent if necessary and thrust its abdomen toward the intruder in what is known as an abdominal slap.|$|E
25|$|On the Erie Canal, some loaded boats {{needed a}} swell {{to get out}} of the lock, {{particularly}} lumber boats, being top heavy, would list <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> get stuck in the lock, and needed a swell to get them out. Some lockkeepers would give a swell to anyone to help them on the way, but some would ask for money for the swell.|$|E

Mark Martin also barrel rolled in a crash during the same race, but instead of lifting {{in the air like}} Newman, his car was hit from behind, causing the weight of the car to shift <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> pull the car onto its roof, rolling once.|$|E

It has a human figure at the center seated on a platform and the human figure is surrounded by four wild animals: an elephant and a tiger <b>to</b> its <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> a water buffalo and a rhinoceros on the other.|$|R
50|$|The current {{building}} was first {{constructed in the}} 1950s. Some of the older features of the building is a long east-west hallway, which was created after the {{building was}} extended <b>to</b> enclose <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> the resulting low, sharply angled roof. The last significant architectural addition was in 1990. In May 2009, the Board voted to begin negotiations with an architecture firm {{to build a new}} school.|$|R
25|$|Female P. californicus and P. apacheanus are {{unusual in}} that they perform an {{acceptance}} dance just before the male touches them. With forelegs high and wide apart and abdomen bent to the side, the female sways before the male, sometimes with a few steps <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> then the other. In other Phidippus species, the female rejects the male by extending the first pair of legs whenever he approaches too closely, and merely fails to ward him off when she is ready to accept him.|$|E
25|$|In 1811 John Edwards junior had a son, Nash Vaughan Edwards, {{named after}} both his cousin {{and a fellow}} lawyer who became the family's benefactor. The work on Rheola House itself did not begin until 1812, and was {{completed}} in 1814. The result was a 'rustic' villa-style building, which retained something of its cottage origins. Following principles of the picturesque, the house is asymmetric, and sits modestly within its wooded landscape. The building has two main facades, each with a full-height bay <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> a veranda along one front. The grounds too were given picturesque features. A stables, laundry and an icehouse were built closer to the lake.|$|E
25|$|When {{the ball}} is new the seam is {{used to create a}} layer of {{turbulent}} air {{on one side of the}} ball, by angling it <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> spinning the ball along the seam. This changes the separation points of the air with the ball; this turbulent air creates a greater coverage of air, providing lift. The next layer of air will have a greater velocity over the side with the turbulent air due to the greater air coverage and as there is a difference in air velocity, the static pressure of both sides of the ball are different and {{the ball is}} both 'lifted' and 'sucked' towards the turbulent airflow side of the ball.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned his}} head first <b>to</b> the <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> then <b>to</b> the other; there sat Schwartz Carl and the one-eyed Hans.

25|$|While {{the bridges}} were being {{prepared}} and constructed, a large fleet of vessels were employed. Within {{the next few}} days, the 819th Amphibian Truck Company arrived with DUKW amphibious trucks {{that were used to}} carry ammunition, gasoline, and rations across the river. The 86th Engineer Heavy Pontoon Battalion and the 291st Engineer Combat Battalion were assigned the mission to build three pontoon ferries. U.S. Naval Unit 1 brought up 24 U.S. Navy LCVP landing craft. The LCVPs were especially useful because they could ferry 32 men across the river in seven minutes, faster than they could walk across the bridge. All of these constantly shuttled across the river, delivering vehicles, equipment, and troops <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> ferrying wounded to the other.|$|E
25|$|L. vechti {{frequently}} request trophallaxis {{from other}} members within their colonies. This behavior is most exhibited whenever a forager {{returns to the}} colony. A fellow colony member may solicit food from the individual {{in a variety of}} ways. The solicitor may approach the forager and bite her on her clypeus or her mouthparts. The two wasps may also push their heads against each other as if they are fighting. While this happens, they either do not move their antennae or hold them quivering <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> their abdomens are pointed downwards slightly. A wasp might also solicit food by rubbing the sides of the other individual's head with her front legs and flapping her wings vigorously. Trophallaxis usually happens too quickly to be observed, and a forager will often leave the nest a few seconds after arriving because she is often rushed by many wasps at the same time. Foragers also often return with insects (such as ants or termites) which they have chewed up and feed to the larvae.|$|E
25|$|Male {{courtship}} {{display is}} similar to that of P. apacheanus, P. clarus, or P. octopunctatus. The male begins his display by holding the carapace very high, shifting the abdomen <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> raising the first pair of legs. In this position, he moves before the female, stopping after each few steps. The male advances in a zig-zag pathway, shifting his abdomen to the other side at the end of each oblique approach. Throughout, the dancing male flicks his forelegs up and down, holding them wide apart at first and bringing them closer and closer together as he nears the female. Then, with forelegs held almost parallel before him, he touches the female cautiously once or twice. If the female remains still at this stage, the male climbs over her, and uses the forelegs to help turn her abdomen to the side. When the genital pore, which lies on the ventral abdomen, is thus exposed, the male inserts his palpus. After 2-3 min., the male withdraws this pedipalp, turns the female's abdomen in the other direction, and inserts the other pedipalp.|$|E
5000|$|This {{variation}} is {{also referred to}} as a sideways moonsault, rolling moonsault, rounding splash, and Original-style moonsault. The attacker climbs the top rope, or other elevated position facing away the opponent, instead of doing a backflip as in a normal moonsault, the attacker rotates his or her body off <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> horizontally <b>and</b> lands on the opponent chest first, facing the turnbuckle as in a normal moonsault.|$|R
