5|$|The Great Depression (1929–c. 1939) hit {{especially}} hard in Western Canada, including Manitoba.

5|$|After {{the control}} of Rupert's Land was passed from Great Britain to the Government of Canada in 1869, Manitoba {{attained}} full-fledged rights and responsibilities of self-government as the first Canadian province {{carved out of the}} Northwest Territories. The Legislative Assembly of Manitoba was established on 14 July 1870. Political parties first emerged between 1878 and 1883, with a two-party system (Liberals and Conservatives). The United Farmers of Manitoba appeared in 1922, and later merged with the Liberals in 1932. Other parties, including the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), appeared during the Great Depression; in the 1950s, Manitoban politics became a three-party system, and the Liberals gradually declined in power. The CCF became <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party of Manitoba (NDP), which came to power in 1969. Since then, the Conservatives and the NDP have been the dominant parties.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of 1956, the Tories were led by former Ontario premier George A. Drew, who had been elected PC leader in 1948 over Saskatchewan MP John Diefenbaker. Drew was the fifth man to lead the Tories in their 21 years out of power. None had come close to {{defeating}} the Liberals; the best performance was in 1945, when John Bracken secured 67 seats for the Tories. The Liberals, though, had won 125seats, and maintained their majority. In the 1953 election, the PC party won 51seats out of the 265 in the House of Commons. Subsequently, the Tories picked up two seats from the Liberals in by-elections, and the Liberals (who had won 169seats in 1953) lost an additional seat to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF, the predecessor of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party (NDP)).|$|E
5|$|Each of the 338 {{members of}} {{parliament}} in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an electoral district or riding. General elections must be called by the governor general, either {{on the advice of}} the prime minister, or if the government loses a confidence vote in the House. Constitutionally, an election may be held no more than five years after the preceding election, although the Canada Elections Act limits this to four years with a fixed election date in October. The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75. Five parties had representatives elected to the federal parliament in the 2015 election: the Liberal Party of Canada who currently form the government, the Conservative Party of Canada who are the Official Opposition, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party, the Bloc Québécois, and the Green Party of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{declaration}} of the German republic in 1918 and the ensuing revolutionary period, the so-called Weimar Republic was founded in August 1919. To form a continuity between the anti-autocratic movement of the 19th century and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>democratic</b> republic, the old black-red-gold tricolour was designated as the national German flag in the Weimar Constitution in 1919. Only the tiny German principalities of Reuss-Greiz, Reuss-Gera, and Waldeck-Pyrmont and its republican successor had upheld the tradition and had always continued to use the German colours of black, red, and or (gold) in their flag. As a civil ensign, the black-white-red tricolour was retained, albeit with the new tricolour in the top left corner.|$|E

5|$|More than 30,000 workers {{walked off}} {{their jobs in}} May 1919 in {{what came to be}} known as the Winnipeg general strike. The strike was a product of postwar recession, labour conditions, the {{activity}} of union organizers and a large influx of returning World War I soldiers seeking work. After many arrests, deportations, and incidents of violence, the strike ended on 21 June 1919 when the Riot Act was read and a group of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers charged a group of strikers. Two strikers were killed and at least thirty others were injured on the day that became known as Bloody Saturday; the event polarized the population. One of the leaders of the strike, J. S. Woodsworth, went on to found Canada's first major socialist party, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, which later became <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party.|$|E
5|$|St. John's {{served as}} {{the capital city of}} the Colony of Newfoundland and the Dominion of Newfoundland before Newfoundland became Canada's tenth {{province}} in 1949. The city now serves as the capital of Newfoundland and Labrador, therefore the provincial legislature is located in the city. The Confederation Building, located on Confederation Hill, is home to the House of Assembly along with the offices for the Members of the House of Assembly (MHAs) and Ministers. The city is represented by ten MHAs, four who are members of the governing Progressive Conservative Party, three that belong to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Democratic</b> Party (NDP), and three that belong to the Liberal Party.

5|$|The Democrats recaptured the House {{after the}} 1882 elections, but the {{incoming}} {{majority in the}} 48th Congress was divided on tariffs, with Randall's protectionist faction in the minority. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>Democratic</b> caucus was more Southern and Western than in previous Congresses, and contained many new members who were unfamiliar with Randall. This led many to propose selecting a Speaker {{more in line with}} their own views, rather than returning Randall to the office. Randall's attempt to canvass the incoming representatives was further hampered by an attack of the gout. In the end, John G. Carlisle of Kentucky, an advocate of tariff reform, bested Randall in a poll of the Democratic caucus by a vote of 104 to 53.|$|E
