40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> {{thickness}} and roughness on the mechanical strength and thermally induced stress voids in nickel-coated optical fibers is theoretically and experimentally investigated. Seven samples of nickel-coated optical fibers with identical fiber length but different coating thickness are prepared using electroless plating method. The thickness of <b>the</b> nickel <b>coating</b> {{is controlled by}} the plating time, with the thicknesses being 35, 65, 119, 218, 308, 419 and 565 nm, respectively. The mechanical and thermal stresses in these nickel-coated optical fibers are analyzed. The atomic force microscope measurement reveals that the roughness of <b>the</b> nickel <b>coating</b> is unchanged when <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> thickness is not larger than 65 nm. However, as <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> thickness is not less than 65 rim, <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> roughness increases with increasing <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> thickness. To increase the tensile strength of the nickel-coated optical fiber, <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> thickness should be not less than 65 nm, and the surface roughness of <b>the</b> nickel <b>coating</b> should not exceed 2. 93 nm. Alternatively, if <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> thickness is in the range of 35 to 218 nm, thermally induced stress voids are less found in the nickel coatings. However, if <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> thickness is in the range of 308 to 565 nm, the number of thermally induced stress voids increases with increasing <b>the</b> <b>coating</b> thickness. To minimize these voids, the surface roughness of <b>the</b> nickel <b>coating</b> should also be decreased. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
