25|$|We said <b>this</b> <b>movie</b> <b>is</b> {{a stylized}} movie, it’s not so {{different}} from the world of a musical. And there were a few other things that contributed to that direction. One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so you know, this is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E

500|$|<b>This</b> <b>movie</b> <b>is</b> widely {{recognized}} as a critique on society. It brings up real issues that the world, and especially densely populated areas, are dealing with today {{and even more so}} in the future. Katherine Ellison asserts that [...] "Americans produce nearly 400 million tons of solid waste per year but recycle {{less than a third of}} it, according to a recent Columbia University study."

[...] Jolie later explained that the film had been a welcome relief after her emotionally demanding role in Girl, Interrupted.|$|E

[...] On the decade's wait before production, she said, [...] "The fact that I had spent so much time with the idea ... allowed it to marinate a little before we shot." ...|$|E
500|$|The filmmaker Steven Soderbergh {{writes that}} [...] "For me there's no {{question}} that cinematically On Her Majesty's Secret Service is the best Bond film {{and the only one}} worth watching repeatedly for reasons other than pure entertainment...

500|$|In contrast, {{the film}} {{gathered}} positive reviews from top critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times enjoyed {{the film and}} gave it {{three out of four}} stars, stating that [...] "Final Destination will no doubt be a hit and inspire the obligatory sequels. Like the original Scream, <b>this</b> <b>movie</b> <b>is</b> too good {{to be the end of}} the road. I have visions of my own". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the film, saying [...] " [...] was playful and energized enough to keep an audience guessing". Joe Leydon of Variety praised the film, saying [...] " [...] generates a respectable amount of suspense and takes a few unexpected turns while covering familiar territory", while Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times said it was [...] "a terrific theatrical feature debut for television veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong". Chris Kaltenbach of The Baltimore Sun found the film [...] "fitfully thrilling", while Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide defined the film as [...] "serviceable enough, if you come to it with sufficiently modest expectations".|$|E

500|$|Schindler's List {{was very}} well {{received}} by many of Spielberg's peers. Filmmaker Billy Wilder wrote to Spielberg saying, [...] "They couldn't have gotten a better man. <b>This</b> <b>movie</b> <b>is</b> absolutely perfection." [...] Polanski, who turned down the chance to direct the film, later commented, [...] "I certainly wouldn't have done {{as good a job}} as Spielberg because I couldn't have been as objective as he was." [...] He cited Schindler's List as an influence on his 1995 film Death and the Maiden. The success of Schindler's List led filmmaker Stanley Kubrick to abandon his own Holocaust project, Aryan Papers, which would have been about a Jewish boy and his aunt who survive the war by sneaking through Poland while pretending to be Catholic. When scriptwriter Frederic Raphael suggested that Schindler's List was a good representation of the Holocaust, Kubrick commented, [...] "Think that's about the Holocaust? That was about success, wasn't it? The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. Schindler's List is about 600 who don't." ...|$|E
500|$|A brief {{article about}} the victorious women's team at the 2002 Commonwealth Games {{inspired}} screenwriter Jaideep Sahni to create a film about the Indian women's hockey team, and he modeled Kabir Khan on hockey coach Maharaj Krishan Kaushik. After listening to the storyline Kaushik suggested that Sahani meet hockey player Mir Ranjan Negi, who faced accusations of throwing the match against Pakistan in the 1982 Asian Games. According to Sahani, {{he was unaware of}} Negi's plight while he wrote the script and any resemblance to Negi's life was coincidental. Negi agreed, saying that he did not [...] "want to hog the limelight. <b>This</b> <b>movie</b> <b>is</b> not a documentary of Mir Ranjan Negi's life. It is in fact the story of a team that becomes a winning lot from a bunch of hopeless girls". Responding to media reports equating Kabir Khan with Negi, Sahani said: [...] "Our script was written {{a year and a half}} back. It is very unfortunate that something, which is about women athletes, has just started becoming about Negi." ...|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "Although <b>this</b> <b>movie</b> <b>is</b> {{effective}} {{moment to}} moment, {{very little of}} it lingers in the mind afterward. The ideal vehicle for our age of immediate sensation and instant gratification, it disappears without a trace {{almost as soon as}} it's consumed." [...] Scott Mendelson of Forbes said, [...] "Avengers: Age of Ultron plays like an obligation, a box to be checked off on a list before all parties move onto the things they really want to do." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote, [...] "This Avengers doesn't always pop the way that the first one sometimes did, partly because its villain isn't as memorable, despite Mr. Spader's silky threat." [...] Camilla Long of The Sunday Times remarked, [...] "Two hours of boredom and boobs add up to a sorry basis for the new Avengers." [...] Much like the release of Guardians of the Galaxy, the film received mixed reviews upon release in China, due to poor translations. The translations, which were said to be too literal, were thought [...] "to have been done by Google Translate." ...|$|E
