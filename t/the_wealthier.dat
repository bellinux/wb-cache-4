5|$|A {{letter from}} Julius II to Henry VII dated 6 July 1504, remarks {{that the king}} had chosen the pope's {{cardinal}}-nephew Galeotto della Rovere as cardinal protector; the letter does not mention Castellesi. della Rovere's selection was likely arranged by Gigli. Castellesi was compensated by being promoted to <b>the</b> <b>wealthier</b> See of Bath and Wells. Castellesi lost favour with the king and fled Rome until the death of Julius II.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 472 BC, Pericles {{presented}} The Persians of Aeschylus at the Greater Dionysia as a liturgy, demonstrating {{that he was one}} of <b>the</b> <b>wealthier</b> men of Athens. Simon Hornblower has argued that Pericles' selection of this play, which presents a nostalgic picture of Themistocles' famous victory at Salamis, shows that the young politician was supporting Themistocles against his political opponent Cimon, whose faction succeeded in having Themistocles ostracized shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{excise tax}} {{continued}} through 1793 in the frontier counties of Appalachia. Opposition remained especially strident in western Pennsylvania. In June, Neville was burned in effigy by {{a crowd of}} about 100 people in Washington County. On the night of November 22, 1793, men broke into the home of tax collector Benjamin Wells in Fayette County. Wells was, like Neville, one of <b>the</b> <b>wealthier</b> men in the region. At gunpoint, the intruders forced him to surrender his commission. President Washington offered a reward for the arrest of the assailants, to no avail.|$|E

50|$|For example, {{consider}} a tax levied on a luxury item such as jewelry. Such a tax, while intended to target <b>the</b> <b>wealthy,</b> may not actually accomplish this objective, as <b>the</b> <b>wealthy</b> can simply choose to buy less jewelry. Instead of collecting {{more money from}} <b>the</b> <b>wealthy,</b> <b>the</b> tax {{has the effect of}} hurting jewelry merchants, who are not the intended targets of the tax.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>wealthier</b> {{portion of}} the {{population}} usually send their children to independent schools as opposed to the government-run schools which are attended by the majority as these are subsidized by the government. School education was made free in 1980, but since 1988, the government has steadily increased the charges attached to school enrollment until they now greatly exceed the real value of fees in 1980. The Ministry of Education of Zimbabwe maintains and operates the government schools but the fees charged by independent schools are regulated by the cabinet of Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|Although {{not very}} much is known about Allen's childhood, the town of Cornwall was {{frontier}} territory in the 1740s. By the time Allen reached his teens, the area, while still a difficult area in which to make a living, began to resemble a town, with wood-frame houses beginning to replace the rough cabins of the early settlers. Joseph Allen died in 1755; {{at the time of}} his death he was one of <b>the</b> <b>wealthier</b> landowners in the area, ran a successful farm, and had previously served as town selectman. Allen had, before his father's death, begun studies under a minister in the nearby town of Salisbury with the goal of gaining admission to Yale College. Allen's brother Ira recalled that, even at a young age, Allen was curious and interested in learning.|$|E
5|$|Bulgarian {{nationalism}} gradually {{emerged during}} the mid-19th century with the economic upsurge of Bulgarian merchants and craftsmen, the development of Bulgarian-funded popular education, the struggle for an autonomous Bulgarian Church and political actions towards {{the formation of a}} separate Bulgarian state. The First and Second Serbian Uprisings had laid the foundation of an autonomous Serbia during the late 1810s, and Greece had been established as an independent state in 1832, {{in the wake of the}} Greek War of Independence. However, support for gaining independence through an armed struggle against the Ottomans was not universal. Revolutionary sentiment was concentrated largely among the more educated and urban sectors of the populace. There was less support for an organized revolt among the peasantry and <b>the</b> <b>wealthier</b> merchants and traders, who feared that Ottoman reprisals would jeopardize economic stability and widespread rural land ownership.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>Wealthy</b> apple {{was one of}} the top five apples grown nationally, but beyond his {{employment}} at the state farm, Gideon never made any money from <b>the</b> <b>Wealthy</b> apple. <b>The</b> <b>Wealthy</b> apple also was the parent of other successful Minnesota apples, such as the Haralson, which was developed at the University of Minnesota's Fruit Breeding Farm in 1922.|$|R

5|$|Carroll was {{the second}} of four sons born to Daniel Carroll of Aghagurty and Littermurna (c. 1642–1688), a Catholic Irishman whose family lost much of their land and wealth in the English Civil War. The exact place of his birth is unclear, though it likely {{occurred}} near {{the small town of}} Aghagurty that Carroll's father took as part of his name. Some of the family property near Aghagurty was obtained by a friend, Richard Grace, who made Daniel Carroll the head tenant. This action gave the family a livelihood, but the family continued to have limited means compared to their former status. It is likely that Charles Carroll was fostered by <b>the</b> <b>wealthier</b> Grace, who had no son; his greater resources could provide for the child's education.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} there is little iodine in the diet, {{typically}} remote inland areas and semi-arid equatorial climates where no marine foods are eaten, iodine deficiency gives rise to hypothyroidism, symptoms of which are extreme fatigue, goitre, mental slowing, depression, weight gain, and low basal body temperatures. Iodine deficiency {{is the leading cause}} of preventable intellectual disability, a result that occurs primarily when babies or small children are rendered hypothyroidic by a lack of the element. The addition of iodine to table salt has largely eliminated this problem in <b>the</b> <b>wealthier</b> nations, but iodine deficiency remains a serious public health problem today in the developing world. Iodine deficiency is also a problem in certain areas of Europe. Information processing, fine motor skills, and visual problem solving are improved by iodine repletion in moderately iodine-deficient children.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} arrival in Maryland, Carroll {{presented}} his commission to the colony's council and was recognized as the new Attorney General of the colony. He arrived in a place already riven by religious and class differences. Carroll and nearly the entire governing structure of the colony, {{with the exception of}} the lower house of the proprietary assembly, were appointed by Calvert. Most of the appointees were Catholic and wealthy, whereas the majority of the population and the lower house of the assembly were Protestant and less wealthy. Carroll arrived in Maryland just as long-standing economic, religious, and political tensions between the poorer Protestant majority and <b>the</b> <b>wealthier</b> and more powerful Catholic minority were reaching a head.|$|E

5|$|Summer Hill's largest mansion, Carleton (now the Grosvenor Hospital's main building), {{was built}} in the early 1880s on Liverpool Road for Charles Carleton Skarrat. The suburb boomed {{with the opening of the}} railway station in 1879, and was {{followed}} by subdivision of much of the surrounding area. Between 1880 and 1910, the area became an upper-class suburb, and was a popular choice for professionals in banking and insurance who worked in the city. Subdivision of gardens for housing continued in the 1920s and 1930s, and socioeconomically the suburb changed as some of <b>the</b> <b>wealthier</b> inhabitants moved to the North Shore. Demolition of most of the surviving mansions in the 1970s allowed erection of home units, especially within walking distance of the railway station.|$|E
5|$|The Second Republic was {{a source}} of hope to the poorest in Spanish society and a threat to the richest, but had broad support from all {{segments}} of society. Niceto Alcalá-Zamora was the first prime minister of the Republic. <b>The</b> <b>wealthier</b> landowners and the middle class accepted the Republic {{because of the lack of}} any suitable alternative. Elections to a constituent Cortes in June 1931 returned a large majority of Republicans and Socialists, with the PSOE gaining 116 seats and Lerroux's Radical Party 94. Lerroux became foreign minister. The government was controlled by a Republican–Socialist coalition, whose members had differing objectives. Some more conservative members believed that the removal of the monarchy was enough by itself, but the Socialists and leftist Republicans demanded much wider reforms.|$|E
5|$|The heavy {{infantry}} of the maniples {{were supported}} {{by a number of}} light infantry (Latin: velites) and cavalry (Latin: equites) troops, typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion. The cavalry was drawn primarily from the richest class of equestrians, but additional cavalry and light infantry were drawn at times from the socii and Latini of the Italian mainland. The equites were still drawn from <b>the</b> <b>wealthier</b> classes in Roman society. There was an additional class of troops (Latin: accensi, also adscripticii and later supernumerarii) who followed the army without specific martial roles and were deployed {{to the rear of the}} triarii. Their role in accompanying the army was primarily to supply any vacancies that might occur in the maniples, but they also seem to have acted occasionally as orderlies to the officers.|$|E
50|$|Chilton {{began his}} career by self-publishing his book <b>The</b> <b>Wealthy</b> Barber in 1989. <b>The</b> <b>Wealthy</b> Barber was written in 26 months, and {{specifically}} targeted those with little investment experience, {{in order to develop}} positive money-spending habits. <b>The</b> <b>Wealthy</b> Barber investigates <b>the</b> lives of three young individuals who regularly visit a local barber for financial advice. <b>The</b> <b>Wealthy</b> Barber {{is one of the best}} selling Canadian books of all time, selling over two million copies since its release.

5|$|The {{peaceful}} town of Duisburg, untroubled {{by political}} and religious unrest, was the perfect place for the flowering of his talent. Mercator quickly {{established himself as a}} man of standing in the town: an intellectual of note, a publisher of maps, and a maker of instruments and globes. There, he also gave a globe to John Dee. Mercator never accepted the privileges and voting rights of a burgher for they came with military responsibilities which conflicted with his pacifist and neutral stance. Nevertheless, he was on good terms with <b>the</b> <b>wealthier</b> citizens and a close friend of Walter Ghim, the twelve times mayor and Mercator's future biographer.|$|E
5|$|The widespread—mainly German—revolutions of 1848–49 sought {{unification}} of Germany {{under a single}} constitution. The revolutionaries pressured various state governments, particularly those in the Rhineland, for a parliamentary assembly that would {{have the responsibility to}} draft a constitution. Ultimately, many of the left-wing revolutionaries hoped this constitution would establish universal male suffrage, a permanent national parliament, and a unified Germany, possibly under the leadership of the Prussian king. This seemed to be the most logical course since Prussia was the strongest of the German states, as well as the largest in geographic size. Generally, center-right revolutionaries sought some kind of expanded suffrage within their states and potentially, a form of loose unification. Their pressure resulted in a variety of elections, based on different voting qualifications, such as the Prussian three-class franchise, which granted to some electoral groups—chiefly <b>the</b> <b>wealthier,</b> landed ones—greater representative power.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} Henry's reign {{the king}} ceased to borrow from the Jewish {{community}} and instead turned to an aggressive campaign of tallage taxation and fines. Financial and anti-Semite violence grew under RichardI. After the massacre of the York community, in which numerous financial records were destroyed, seven towns were nominated to separately store Jewish bonds and money records and this arrangement ultimately evolved into the Exchequer of the Jews. After an initially peaceful start to John's reign, the king again began to extort money from the Jewish community, imprisoning <b>the</b> <b>wealthier</b> members, including Isaac of Norwich, until a huge, new taillage was paid. During the Baron's War of 1215–17, the Jews were subjected to fresh anti-Semitic attacks. HenryIII restored some order and Jewish money-lending became sufficiently successful again to allow fresh taxation. The Jewish community became poorer {{towards the end of}} the century and was finally expelled from England in 1290 by EdwardI, being largely replaced by foreign merchants.|$|E
50|$|The {{party was}} given with {{the pretext of}} being a children's party, but its real purpose was for <b>the</b> <b>wealthy</b> host's family to talk {{business}} with rich members of <b>the</b> community. <b>The</b> <b>wealthiest</b> guest was Julian Mastakovich, a rotund landowner.|$|R

50|$|As a result, <b>the</b> <b>wealthiest</b> echelon could {{ensure that}} the elected Magistrates were always their own members.

5|$|Despite the setbacks, Kasztner, Hansi Brand and {{the rest}} of the {{committee}} secured the release of around 1,684 Jews, including 273 children, who were allowed to leave Budapest for Switzerland by train on 30 June 1944. The committee paid SS officer Kurt Becher $1000 per person in foreign currency, shares, jewellery and gold, raised from <b>the</b> <b>wealthier</b> passengers to cover the cost of the rest. After an unexplained detour to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, the passengers arrived in Switzerland in two batches in August and December that year. Joel Brand's mother, sister and niece were on the train, as were 10 members of Kasztner's family and 388 people from the Kolozsvár ghetto in his home town. Kastner's relationship with these passengers led to the criticism that his negotiations with Becher had focused on saving people he knew, an allegation that led to his assassination in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Karmal {{was born}} Sultan Hussein on 6 January 1929, {{was the son}} of Muhammad Hussein Hashem, a Major General in the Afghan Army and former {{governor}} of the province of Paktia, and was the second of five siblings. His family was one of <b>the</b> <b>wealthier</b> families in Kabul. His ethnic background is disputed, some claim that he was Tajik who represented himself as a Ghilzai Pashtun but others claim that he descended from Hindu ancestors of Kashmir. In 1986, Karmal announced that he, and his brother Mahmud Baryalay, were Pashtun because their mother came from the Mullakhel branch of the Pashtuns. However, this was controversial, considering that lineage in Afghanistan is supposed to be traced through the father, not the mother. The accusation that he was of Indian Muslim ancestry {{comes from the fact that}} his birthname, Sultan Hussein, is a common Indian Muslim name. In addition, Karmal's own father denied his own ethnicity; Karmal's father was a Tajik. To further confuse the matter, Karmal spoke Dari (Persian) and not Pashto.|$|E
5|$|The Normans {{initially}} did {{not significantly}} alter {{the operation of the}} manor or the village economy. William reassigned large tracts of land amongst the Norman elite, creating vast estates in some areas, particularly along the Welsh border and in Sussex. The biggest change in the years after the invasion was the rapid {{reduction in the number of}} slaves being held in England. In the 10th century slaves had been very numerous, although their number had begun to diminish as a result of economic and religious pressure. Nonetheless, the new Norman aristocracy proved harsh landlords. <b>The</b> <b>wealthier,</b> formerly more independent Anglo-Saxon peasants found themselves rapidly sinking down the economic hierarchy, swelling the numbers of unfree workers, or serfs, forbidden to leave their manor and seek alternative employment. Those Anglo-Saxon nobles who had survived the invasion itself were rapidly assimilated into the Norman elite or economically crushed.|$|E
