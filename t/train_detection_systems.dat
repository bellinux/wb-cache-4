50|$|The {{primary safety}} {{concerns}} with dark territory {{stems from the}} lack of any form of direct or indirect train detection along the route. <b>Train</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems</b> such as track circuits not only alert other trains to the presence of a potential hazard, but can also alert dispatchers or other monitoring systems to the same. Dark territory also lacks the ability to control or lock switches onto the main track, detect misaligned switches, broken rails or runaway rail cars. In most cases these drawbacks are mitigated by the light traffic and low speed of the trains in dark territory, but a runaway train (such as the crude oil unit train in 2013's Lac-Mégantic derailment) will not respect limits on speed and is not detectable by rail traffic controllers on a line with no signals or track circuits.|$|E

Indian railway network is the biggest in South Asia and most complicated of all. Though the timetable has been perfectly framed, {{it is not possible}} to adhere to the predefined schedule. That is why train accidents have become common phenomena. As there are nearly 30, 000 level crossings in India, out of which nearly 16500 are unmanned level crossings. This is a big challenge for Government to supervise and manning the level crossings. So why don’t we improvise the system so that it can by itself detect train presence and avoid accidents!!! Presently government is also involved in deploying some warning devices at unmanned level crossings to prevent accidents.

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} research into adhesion and contaminant films, low adhesion problems continue to plague the modern railway, particularly in autumn when leaves on line and damp conditions combine {{to form a}} very low adhesion contaminant film on the rail head which cannot be removed easily. Whether accelerating, braking or simply maintaining the desired speed, good adhesion between rail and wheel is essential. Without good adhesion the braking distances are very long and for safety reasons trains need to reduce speed. Sudden drops in adhesion can cause havoc with time-tables, {{and can lead to}} accidents - the number of signals passed a danger is significantly higher in autumn. In addition to low-adhesion problems, contaminants (sometimes environmental, sometimes as a deliberate adhesion-control) can cause problems with track circuitry and the failure of <b>train</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems</b> can also lead to accidents.

40|$|The railway is a {{safe and}} not {{expensive}} way of transport and it is widely used all over the world. In countries with rough weather conditions, as Sweden, many delays occur every year which implies a large {{waste of time and}} money to the railway companies. Most of these delays are related to the <b>train</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems.</b> In Sweden, the train detection infrastructure is based on track circuits. Therefore an investment of research time on this issue may bring a lot of profits for the railway community. The electromagnetic interference (EMI) are involved in most of the problems occurred in the railway system in general. Consequently a classification of the most probable disturbances related to the train detection infrastructure is needed. After a thorough analysis of the Swedish railway framework it has been concluded to focus the attention on this work research in three different scenarios. They have been simulated by the software CST STUDIO SUITE® (Computer Simulation Technology Studio Suite), supported by real measurement on site. A depth review of the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standards has been realized for the measurement set in order to perform the battery test according to them. The results show that the modelling developed fits with reality and it is reliable for the study of track circuit sections. Furthermore, from the standard review, it has to be mentioned that there are some weak points not covered by the standards so a further research should be advised in this scope.

This paper will {{provide an overview of}} the Affordable Level Crossings project, a project that is performing research in both engineering and human factors aspects of low-cost level crossing warning devices (LCLCWDs), and is facilitating a comparative trial of these devices over a period of 12 months in several jurisdictions. Low-cost level crossing warning devices (LCLCWDs) are characterised by the use of alternative technologies for high cost components including train detection and connectivity (e. g. radar, acoustic, magnetic induction <b>train</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems</b> and wireless connectivity replacing traditional track circuits and wiring). These devices often make use of solar power where mains power is not available, and aim to make substantial savings in lifecycle costs. The project involves trialling low-cost level crossing warning devices in shadow-mode, where devices are installed without the road-user interface at a number of existing level crossing sites that are already equipped with conventional active warning systems. It may be possible that the deployment of lower-cost devices can provide a significantly larger safety benefit over the network than a deployment of expensive conventional devices, as the lower cost would allow more passive level crossing sites to be upgraded with the same capital investment. The project will investigate reliability and safety integrity issues of the low-cost devices, as well as evaluate lifecycle costs and investigate human factors issues related to warning reliability. This paper will focus on the requirements and safety issues of LCLCWDs, and will provide an overview of the Rail CRC projects...|$|E
40|$|The {{basis of}} all railway {{signalling}} activities is {{the knowledge of}} the position and velocity of all trains in the system. The railways traditionally rely on <b>train</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems</b> for this knowledge. However, the dependence of these systems on railway infrastructures limits their ability to cope with the advent of new high-speed lines and the development of freight networks across the Europe. Hence, {{there is a need for}} the introduction of modern positioning technologies into the railways. Unfortunately railways provide an unfriendly environment for satellite-based radio positioning systems (GNSS). For this reason it is common to integrate GNSS with low-cost inertial sensors (INS) but such systems cannot meet all railway positioning requirements. This thesis examines the potential of enhancing such an integrated GNSS/INS system with a digital route model (DRM). The study is carried out through a series of simulations of typical railway positioning scenes. A simulated database of GNSS, inertial and DRM data is built from real GPS data collected on a rail line between Norwich and Lowestoft. Several tests are first performed to test the validity of the database. Simulations are then done with a number of traditional INS/GPS integration architectures to test the possible performance of each system in the railway environment using lowcost INS sensors. The DRM-aiding is then realised through an integration with the GNNS/INS system via an extended Kalman Filter. Results from the study confirm the need for additional positioning information for an integrated system with low-cost inertial sensors to deal with difficult satellite signal situations such as tunnels, deep cuttings and covered stations. It is shown that a DRM leads to significant improvements in the overall system positioning performance. Also the optimal configuration, in terms of point spacing and accuracy, for a digital route model is selected from amongst simulated candidates...|$|E

40|$|The South African railway {{company makes}} use of a <b>train</b> wheel <b>detection</b> <b>system</b> to monitor the trains present on a {{particular}} track, noting their lengths, positions and speeds. Interference due to distorted traction currents cause havoc with this system rendering the information gathered unreliable. To combat this interference two paths are available to reduce the <b>detection</b> <b>systems</b> susceptibility. These paths include the addition of shielding between the railway track and the wheel detectors, which form the functional entities of the <b>train</b> wheel <b>detection</b> <b>system,</b> and the installation of a cable running parallel to the railway track with connections to it some distance {{before and after the}} position of the wheel detector. To verify these paths, high frequency experiments were performed in the lab as well as FEM simulations. To perform the high frequency experiments a source capable of producing the high frequency current needed was designed and constructed, along with a well shielded measurement system to enable the mapping of the flux density within the region occupied by and surrounding the wheel detector. The results of both the experimental measurements and simulations yielded that the interfering magnetic field could indeed be reduced through the use of the two available paths, when they are both applied separately and in combination. To obtain the greater reduction in the interfering field within the area occupied by and surrounding the wheel detector the paths should be used in combination. Therefore {{through the use of a}} shield that is constructed from a magnetic material and the installation of a parallel cable the <b>train</b> wheel <b>detection</b> <b>system</b> can be made more robust.

40|$|In {{countries}} with rough weather conditions, frequent delays cause railway companies {{to waste time}} and money. Many of these delays {{are related to the}} <b>train</b> <b>detection</b> <b>systems,</b> as the old DC track circuits are still used in some countries, including Sweden, our case study. Since {{the most important factor in}} the railway system is safety, in some cases, the train detection system gets incorrect information and detects a non-existent train. The train slows down to avoid a problem in the track (with other trains or other faults), causing prolonged delays with cascading effects. The analysis in this licentiate contributes to the detection and reduction of TC failures; this, in turn, will save money for the railway community. A classification of the most probable causes of failures related to the train detection system was derived from the Swedish failures report database 0 FELIA. After classifying failures, we focussed on the three most common worst case scenarios: low resistance between the rails, external interference such as a lightning strike, and iron-powder-bridges in the insulated joint. Electromagnetic interferences (EMI) are a problem for the railway system in general. One source of electromagnetic (EM) transients is the return current harmonic produced by the engine of the rolling stock itself. In the first stage of this licentiate, we implemented a Matlab model of the power supply system of the Swedish railway infrastructure, using the characteristics and previous measures of a real source. A model of a train as an active load validated by the manufacturer was integrated as a subsystem in different positions of the infrastructure. This method was used to study the behaviour of the low frequency system from an electrical point of view but it could also be used as input for an electromagnetic model using high frequencies. The model was validated through measurements taken in northern Sweden. In addition, a 3 D model of the whole railway system was proposed. The simulation software was CST STUDIO SUITE® (Computer Simulation Technology Studio Suite), supported by real measurements on site and the lab to tune and validate the model. The results of the simulation show that the model fits with reality and is reliable for the study of track circuit sections. Some measurements followed the current standards, but we also analysed points not covered by them, allowing us to update the current standardsGodkänd; 2014; 20140924 (emirod); Nedanstående person kommer att hålla licentiatseminarium för avläggande av teknologie licentiatexamen.

Level crossing protection is the consequence of having level crossings on a railway line. Its aim is to avoid collisions between trains and road traffic. From {{the point of view of}} the railway, the requirement to be met by such protection is quite simple: it has to stop all road traffic before the passing of a train.

This paper is presenting the <b>train</b> <b>detection</b> <b>system</b> “RND- Rolling Noise Detection ” involved in <b>train</b> <b>detection</b> before the arrival of train. Rolling noise is main contributor of noise produced due to the running of train over the tracks. It is produced by the wheel rail interaction at the 0 m height. As it is a sound wave, it can travel in air as well as in solids. In air it is audible to us but in solids it travels as seismic waves. It is detectable in air and solids also, but the speed varies in both mediums. Sound waves travel faster in solids than air. Authors experimentally detected the rolling noise inside the rail tracks well before the arrival of train at measurement point and have tried to provide a solution for railways to make unmanned level crossings more safe and reliable by detecting train well before in time so that warning and barrier actuation can be done on time. This can be done by detecting rolling noise caused by train in advance to the arrival of train at some reference measurement point...|$|R

At the same time it is recognized that traditional defensive mechanisms provide some protection, but has to be complemented with supervisory features, such as intrusion <b>detection.</b> Intrusion <b>detection</b> <b>systems</b> (IDS) monitor the network and the host computers for signs of intrusions and intrusion attempts. However, an IDS needs training data to learn how to discriminate between intrusion attempts and benign events. In order to properly <b>train</b> the <b>detection</b> <b>system</b> we need data containing attack manifestations. The provision of such manifestations may pose considerable problems and effort, especially since many attacks are not successful against a particular system version. This paper suggests a general model for how to implement an automatic tool {{that can be used for}} generation of successful attacks and finding the relevant manifestations with a limited amount of effort and time delay. Those manifestations can then promptly be used for setting up the IDS and countering the attack. To illustrate the concepts we provide an implementation example for an important attack type, the stack-smashing buffer overflow attack...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis looks into ways of developing a new approach for fault tree automation. Initially an extensive literature survey was undertaken to try and identify if any methods contained useful features that might warrant further development. The two methods that were chosen were the decision table method and the digraph method. The new hybrid method {{is based on the}} flexibility of the decision table method but incorporates a way of detecting, classifying and analysing control loops, similar to the use of operators in the digraph approach. As well as using operators to deal with control loops new operators are introduced that deal with current and no current in electrical circuits. These new operators have been developed {{to be able to handle}} components that are common to multiple circuits. The advantages of applying operators during fault tree construction is to reduce the number of repeated and inconsistent events that may occur in the tree, and to significantly reduced the size of the constructed fault tree. Thus producing a tree logic that can easily be followed by an analyst and is in an appropriate format for direct input to an fault tree analysis code. The new method has been automated and successfully applied to three railway safety systems obtained from London Underground Ltd. To test the ability of the Automatic Fault Tree Construction Code (AFTCC) the complexity of each of the three systems increased. The first system, the Train Stop system, did not contain any circuits; the second, the <b>Train</b> <b>Detection</b> <b>system,</b> contained simple circuits and lastly the Train Braking system, contained multiple nested circuits...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{noticeable}} difference between different road users, specifically between passenger vehicles and heavy vehicles {{such as its}} length and weight. The majority of previous research were focused on general highway traffic that included passenger cars, trucks, buses, motorcycles, etc. Moreover, HRGC safety studies of specific types of vehicles are relatively few and heavy vehicle safety at grade crossing is even more under-explored. This research thus focuses on the following objectives: Identify factors related to different injury severity levels of heavy-vehicle drivers (truck/truck-trailer) drivers in crashes reported at HRGCs; to identify a more suitable statistical model for injury severity modeling of truck involved crashes. This study considered variables {{that have not been}} explored in previous injury severity studies of truck-involved crashes at HRGCs. Three unordered response models: Multinomial Logit model (MNL), Nested Logit model (NL) and Mixed Logit model (RPL) were evaluated to investigate injury severity of drivers of heavy-vehicles involved in crashes at HRGCs. Based on criteria used for judging the models and the dataset used in this study, it was concluded that the RPL was most suitable for modeling truck drivers’ injuries in crashes reported at HRGCs amongst the models considered. Truck drivers’ injuries in crashes reported at HRGCs are positively associated with speed of train and road user (truck/trailer), truck-train crash, when train strike road user (truck/trailer), hazardous materials by either one or both users, driver behavior “went around the gates”, age of driver, crashes reported in rural areas and crashes at minimum crossing angle of 60 - 90 degrees. Whereas truck drivers’ injuries are negatively associated with <b>train</b> <b>detection</b> <b>system,</b> gates, if the track is signaled, when the track is obstructed, HRGCs within 500 feet of a highway and position of vehicle “heavy vehicle stopped on the crossing”.

40|$|As an {{integral}} part the railway network infrastructure, insulated rail joints (IRJs) electrically isolate track segments providing critical feedback to both track signaling and <b>train</b> position <b>detection</b> <b>systems.</b> Because of the discontinuous nature of IRJs, accumulated damage at the railhead is high. Failure modes include plastic flow of metal across joints, bolt and fishplate failures, delamination of insulated material and, {{as a result of}} rolling contact fatigue, end post and endpost surface damage. In the current investigation, microstructural changes in the vicinity of endposts of IRJs made from both surface coated and uncoated rail are investigated using techniques of optical and scanning electron microscopy. Damaged IRJs made from pearlitic head hardened rail steel are compared with head hardened rail steel laser coated with martensitic stainless steel, the latter having an increased service life. Problems associated with the surface coating are identified and approaches to further improving IRJ resistance to rolling contact fatigue suggested...|$|R
