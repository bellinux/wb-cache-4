Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of <b>temporal</b> <b>and</b> <b>spatial</b> relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.|$|E
5|$|A 900,000‑year‑long {{period of}} {{quiescence}} followed after the felsic shield-building stage, {{during which time}} erosion ate away at the shield's gentle slopes. This quiescence {{was followed by a}} mafic capping stage between 2.2and 0.8million years ago, but renewed activity might have occurred in the last 340,000years. Alkali olivine basalts of the mafic capping stage were derived from the fractionation of a clinopyroxene, olivine and oxide assemblage. However, the associated hawaiite lavas may have derived from an alkali olivine basalt parent by the fractionation of a clinopyroxene-dominated assemblage at higher pressures. As volcanic activity waned during the mafic capping stage, lava flows became more viscous and decreased in volume. This suggests that parental magmas may have been derived by increasingly smaller degrees of partial melting with time. If volcanic activity of the Itcha Range is related to a hotspot, this <b>temporal</b> <b>and</b> <b>spatial</b> evolution would suggest a waning heat source.|$|E

5|$|The most {{frequently}} used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible–infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface reflectance, {{which has led to}} other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, {{it is important to have}} continuous information about the snow cover. Passive microwave sensors are especially valuable for <b>temporal</b> <b>and</b> <b>spatial</b> continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack.|$|E

25|$|Drugs {{of abuse}} {{typically}} affect the mesolimbic system, or more specifically, the reward pathway {{of the nervous}} system. Amongst the common drugs of abuse, nicotine {{is one of the}} strongest agonists at the nicotinic cholinergic synapse. Nicotine, competing with acetylcholine (ACh), acts through the nonsynaptic, preterminal, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) to initiate a membrane potential change and propagate an intracellular Ca2+ signal, thus encouraging the release of neurotransmitters. The specific and characteristic role of calcium current mediated nAChR activity has a different voltage-dependence than other Ca2+ permeable ion channels, as well as different <b>temporal</b> <b>and</b> <b>spatial</b> distribution and as a result, the nonsynaptic nAChR activity enhances the induction of synaptic potentiation, promoting the learning of substance dependence.|$|E

Dual-polarization radar, being implemented to the US NEXRAD network, may provide enhanced warning of tornadoes and severe winds and hail associated with the hook echo due to distinct precipitation drop characteristics. Polarimetric radar boosts precipitation observation and prediction, especially rainfall rates, hail detection, and distinguishing precipitation types. Proposed radar technologies, such as phased array and CASA, would further improve observations and forecasts by increasing the <b>temporal</b> <b>and</b> <b>spatial</b> resolution of scans in the former as well as providing low-level radar data over a wide area in the latter.|$|E

The proposed scheme utilizes both <b>temporal</b> <b>and</b> No Reference <b>spatial</b> (picture’s) quality, which are application–level QoS, and estimates the user–level QoS from the application–level QoS. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, we compare the proposed scheme with a scheme which uses only temporal quality for the estimation and a scheme with both <b>temporal</b> <b>and</b> Full Reference <b>spatial</b> quality. We made a simple experiment of audio–video IP transmission; we measured the application–level QoS directly and assessed the user–level QoS by the method of successive categories. Applying the principal component analysis and multiple regression analysis to the experimental results, we obtained multiple regression lines (i. e., equations for the estimation). As a result, we see that the user–level QoS can be estimated with high accuracy by using both <b>temporal</b> quality <b>and</b> <b>spatial</b> quality. I...|$|R

25|$|The Eungella National Park, {{where the}} {{northern}} gastric-brooding frog was once found, was under threat from bushfires and weed invasion. Continual fires may have destroyed or fragmented {{sections of the}} forest. The outskirts of the park are still subject to weed invasion and chytrid fungus has been located within several rainforest creeks within the park. It was thought that the declines of the northern gastric-brooding frog during 1984 and 1985 were possibly normal population fluctuations. Eight months after the initial discovery of the northern gastric-brooding frog, sick and dead Eungella torrent frogs, which cohabitat the streams with gastric brooding frogs, were observed in streams in Pelion State Forest. Given the more recent {{understanding of the role}} of the amphibian disease in the decline and disappearance of amphibians, combined with the <b>temporal</b> <b>and</b> <b>spatial</b> pattern of the spread of the pathogen in Australia, it appears most likely that the disease was responsible for the decline and disappearance of the gastric-brooding frogs. Despite continued efforts to locate the northern gastric-brooding frog it has not been found. The last reported wild specimen was seen in the 1980s. In August 2010 a search organised by the Amphibian Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature set out to look for various species of frogs thought to be extinct in the wild, including the gastric-brooding frog.|$|E
