Xhinovci earned the reputation of a [...] "fierce fighter" [...] and commanded the respect of local Albanians. His comrades gave him the nickname [...] "Hitler" [...] due to his uncanny resemblance to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. Xhinovci told journalist Una Hajdari: [...] "People have called me Hitler since my army days. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> look a lot like him—unlike the English guy who plays him in that movie," [...] apparently a reference to Charlie Chaplin's role in The Great Dictator.|$|E
500|$|Following their signing to Interscope, Brand New stopped touring to work {{on their}} third album and major label debut. In this time, little to no {{interviews}} or updates came from the band. In 2004, Jesse Lacey told Chart magazine that he had written a [...] "few songs" [...] for the next album, commenting that [...] "the other guys love it already". He made mention of the pressure he felt with the [...] "loads of anticipation building up on my shoulders," [...] saying that he suffered from depression because of this; [...] "I'm getting depressed with all of the anxiety about the album and <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> write my best stuff when I'm in that state. Great, I'll spend the next six months all depressed and the rest of band will be excited, so that some good (material) might come out. And then I have to contend with how it's received." [...] Lacey also said that the album would [...] "move into new territory for Brand New".|$|E
500|$|I {{can only}} {{remember}} {{bits and pieces}} of the game. I was psyched. I had a feeling of euphoria. I was zeroed in on the [...] glove, but I didn't hit the glove too much. I remember hitting a couple of batters, and the bases were loaded two or three times. The ball was small sometimes, the ball was large sometimes, sometimes I saw the catcher, sometimes I didn't. Sometimes, I tried to stare the hitter down and throw while I was looking at him. I chewed my gum until it turned to powder. I started having a crazy idea in the fourth inning that Richard Nixon was the home plate umpire, and once I thought I was pitching a baseball to Jimi Hendrix, who to me was holding a guitar and swinging it over the plate. <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> had about three to four fielding chances. I remember diving {{out of the way of}} a ball I thought was a line drive. I jumped, but the ball wasn't hit hard and never reached me.|$|E

500|$|Osborne {{describes}} the scenes that follow—Cavaradossi's interrogation, his torture, Scarpia's sadistic tormenting of Tosca—as Puccini's musical equivalent of grand guignol to which Cavaradossi's brief [...] "Vittoria! Vittoria!" [...] {{on the news}} of Napoleon's victory gives only partial relief. Scarpia's aria [...] "Già, mi dicon venal" [...] ("Yes, <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> am venal") is closely followed by Tosca's [...] "Vissi d'arte". A lyrical andante based on Tosca's act 1 motif, {{this is perhaps the}} opera's best-known aria, yet was regarded by Puccini as a mistake; he considered eliminating it since it held up the action. Fisher calls it [...] "a Job-like prayer questioning God for punishing a woman who has lived unselfishly and righteously". In the act's finale, Newman likens the orchestral turmoil which follows Tosca's stabbing of Scarpia to the sudden outburst after the slow movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. After Tosca's contemptuous [...] "E avanti a lui tremava tutta Roma!" [...] ("All Rome trembled before him"), sung on a middle C monotone [...] (sometimes spoken), the music gradually fades, ending what Newman calls [...] "the most impressively macabre scene in all opera." [...] The final notes in the act are those of the Scarpia motif, softly, in a minor key.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Gosling {{appeared}} as a disturbed young art student in Stay, a psychological thriller film co-starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor. In an uncomplimentary review of the film, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said that Gosling [...] "like his fans, deserves better." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety felt that the [...] "capable" [...] McGregor and Gosling [...] "deliver nothing new from what they've shown before". The film grossed $8 million worldwide. Gosling was unfazed by the negative reaction: [...] "I had a kid {{come up to me}} on the street, 10 years old, and he says, 'Are you that guy from Stay? What the f--- was that movie about?' I think that's great. I'm just as proud if someone says, 'Hey, you made me sick in that movie,' as if <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> made them cry.” Gosling next starred in 2006's Half Nelson as a drug-addicted junior high school teacher who forms a bond with a young student. To prepare for the role, Gosling moved to New York for one month before shooting began. He lived in a small apartment in Brooklyn and spent time shadowing an eighth grade teacher. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described [...] "a mesmerizing performance ... that shows the kind of deep understanding of character few actors manage." [...] Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle drew comparisons with Marlon Brando and declared that [...] "nobody who cares about great acting will want to miss his performance". Roger Ebert felt the performance [...] "proves he's one of the finest actors working in contemporary movies." [...] He was nominated for an Academy Award. The film grossed $4 million at the worldwide box office. In 2007, he was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.|$|E

He was convicted of the murders in 1978 and given two life sentences. The trial judge described the killings as [...] "a frenzied attack, a psychotic outburtst". White maintained that the UFF's second-in-command (and later North Belfast UDA brigadier) Davy Payne, also known as [...] "The Psychopath", {{was part of the}} assassination squad and played {{a leading role in the}} killings. Historian Ian S. Wood confirmed Payne's central involvement in the double killing. Although Payne had been questioned by the RUC after the killings, he admitted nothing and never faced any charges.

2500|$|The new line-up signalled {{a decisive}} change in musical policy - early songs are dropped {{and a more}} retro, rock 'n' roll sound, highly {{influenced}} by American 1960s surf music and garage rock emerged. Jack formed the self-funded label Ostrich GT and released the debut 7" [...] single [...] "Can't Get Enough", which showcased the band's rapidly developing Hot Rod aesthetic ("I've been around / The fuzz ran me downtown / <b>They</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> ran a red light / Oh well, I guess they were right"). The single sold well at early gigs and a follow-up was soon issued. [...] "Chrysler 440" [...] continued the street racing theme while B-side [...] "Fuel Injection (it's better)" [...] reflected Jack's knowledge of classic cars ("I got a big block Ford / It had a carburettor / Now I've got fuel injection / It's better"). Jack's occasional Ostrich Club nights held in various venues around Doncaster saw the band develop a loyal following and a growing reputation as they headlined their own gigs and supported some bigger names.|$|E
2500|$|The ADE 651 {{has been}} used at {{hundreds}} of Iraqi police and Iraqi military checkpoints across the country, often replacing physical inspections of vehicles. Major-General Jihad (also transliterated [...] "Jehad") al-Jabiri of the Interior Ministry's General Directorate for Combating Explosives has defended the device: [...] "Whether it's magic or scientific, what I care about is detecting bombs. I don't care what <b>they</b> <b>say.</b> <b>I</b> know more about bombs than the Americans do. In fact, I know more about bombs {{than anyone in the}} world." [...] He told a press conference that the ADE 651 has detected [...] "hundreds of roadside bombs and car bombs" [...] and any deficiencies were due to defective training in the device's use. The Iraqi Interior Minister, Jawad al-Bulani, also defended the device, telling Al Iraqiya television that the ADE 651 had [...] "managed to prevent and detect more than 16,000 bombs that would be a threat to people's life and more than 733 car bombs were defused." [...] He said: [...] "Iraq is considered as a market area for many companies producing such devices ... and there are other rival companies trying to belittle the efficiency of these instruments the government is buying".|$|E

Tony in turn tells McGee that he took the couch. Ziva asks him why he lied and he returns the question. There was much {{speculation}} {{on the part of}} fans about whether the characters might have shared more than was divulged, but Weatherly said in response, [...] "The truth of what happened is probably something that can be discovered inside the episode itself. If you really listen to what <b>they</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> think it is pretty clear what happened: Nothing." [...] He clarified that Tony and Ziva had [...] "a tremendous amount of fun" [...] in Paris and that, [...] "Ziva had more fun with Tony than she {{thought she was going to}} have, which maybe shocked her a little bit, because she was so angry at him after he killed her boyfriend last year." [...] Cote de Pablo added, [...] "Michael has his views of what happened in Paris. I have mine. We haven't discussed it. But all I can say is it was good." [...] Shortly afterwards, Glenn Diaz from BuddyTV reported that the cast was divided on whether or not the characters should be allowed to progress beyond [...] "unfulfilled sexual tension".|$|E

2500|$|After its release, it was aired by MTV a {{total of}} three times, all of these after the 10pm watershed, due to its highly charged sexual content, before being {{permanently}} banned; this made it Madonna's second video to be banned from airing by the channel, after [...] "Justify My Love" [...] in 1990. MTV spokeswoman Linda Alexander said, [...] "The themes of the video are clearly aimed at a more adult audience. It is not appropriate for a general viewing audience". Madonna herself said she understood the channel's ban on the video; [...] "MTV plays to a huge audience {{and a lot of them}} are children, and a lot of themes I'm exploring in my videos aren't meant for children, so I understand that <b>they</b> <b>say</b> <b>I</b> can't show it [...] I accept it". Rolling Stones Anthony DeCurtis said that [...] "This is pretty much normal Madonna fare, [...] But how much longer can you continue mining sexuality? In checking off your list of taboos, how far can you take them? At what point does it just stop being interesting?". Similarly, David Browne from Entertainment Weekly, asked [...] "Haven’t we seen most of this stuff before? Can we be bored with the subject matter already? [...] no emotion is attached to the mechanics of these acts, so it’s difficult to identify with or care about the characters". The video was nominated for the 1993 Billie Awards in four categories: Consumer print, trade print (music) and consumer print (retail), the most for a single entry. It also was ranked at number 16 on VH1's [...] "50 Sexiest Video Moments". The video was made commercially available in 2009, when it was included, albeit in a censored version, on Madonna's [...] compilation; it had previously been excluded from 1999's [...]|$|E
