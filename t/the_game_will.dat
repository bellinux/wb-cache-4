5|$|With the {{announcement}} {{and development of}} the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, speculation spread that an enhanced remake of the original Final Fantasy VII would be released for the PlayStation 3. This conjecture was sparked at the 2005 E3 convention by the release of a video featuring the opening sequence of Final Fantasy VII recreated using the PlayStation 3's graphical capabilities. Throughout the lifespan of the PS3, SquareEnix stated that such a game was not in development. A high definition remake was eventually announced at E3 2015 for the PlayStation 4. <b>The</b> <b>game</b> <b>will</b> be more than a high definition remaster, with director Tetsuya Nomura stating that <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>will</b> have changes made to its story and combat system.|$|E
5|$|A fourth {{game in the}} series, Metroid Prime 4, was {{announced}} at Nintendo's E3 2017 Spotlight livestream, and is currently under development for the Nintendo Switch.

5|$|In Japan, {{the game}} was {{originally}} scheduled to be released for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on March 23, 2017, but was delayed to March 30, 2017, due to certain circumstances. The limited edition of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>will</b> come with a soundtrack CD and either a Ram (for the PS4 version) or Rem (for the PSVita version) SD figure.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to using a turntable, players {{have the option}} to sing or rap to the mixes' lyrics, similar to vocal parts in current Guitar Hero or Rock Band games using a compatible microphone controller from most previous rhythm games. <b>The</b> <b>game</b> <b>will</b> score vocals based on the matching of pitch, beat and rhythm.|$|E

5|$|In this {{variation}} White {{tries to}} avoid the move a2–a3 {{in order to gain}} a tempo over the 7.a3 variation. After the standard moves 7...Ngxe5 8.Nxe5 Nxe5 9.Be2 followed by 10.0-0 it is Black's last chance to exchange the Bb4 for the Nd2. <b>The</b> <b>game</b> <b>will</b> take an entirely different structure depending on whether Black gives up the bishop pair or tries to keep it.|$|E
5|$|Interaction with non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) {{was a large}} design focus. When {{the player}} interacts with a non-player character, <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>will</b> enter a cutscene-like conversation mode where the player advances the conversation by selecting {{from a list of}} dialogue options. The player's choices often have a substantial effect on both gameplay and plot, as non-player characters will react in different ways depending on the selected answer (e.g. rudeness makes them less likely to provide assistance).|$|E
5|$|On July 6, 2016, Turtle Rock {{announced}} that the game was transitioning to become a free-to-play game under the title Evolve: Stage 2 due to the game downloadable content controversy and mixed critical reception. The new version introduces new changes, including longer respawn time, non-ranked queue for casual players, and changes to hunters' abilities. Turtle Rock also promised that patches would be released more frequently and that most items featured in the game would be unlocked through simply playing the game. The alpha version of Stage 2 would begin on July 7, 2016, for PC, and {{will be followed by}} a beta in August in the same year. Players who purchased <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>will</b> be given the Founders status, which gives them exclusive cosmetic items. In October 2016, Turtle Rock {{announced that}} they would end support for Evolve, and that Evolve: Stage 2 would not be released for consoles, but servers for <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>will</b> remain online for ‘foreseeable future’. Turtle Rock also revealed that it was 2K's decision to end the game's support.|$|E

5|$|Pendragon's only form of defence in {{the game}} {{is his ability to}} utilise various magical spells, in which the correct spell is {{required}} in order to defeat certain enemies. If the player is hit by an attack of any enemy in the castle, Pendragon will lose energy, or in some cases, time will be deducted from the countdown timer. If the player completely runs out of energy or fails to destroy the Staff of Karnath before midnight, <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>will</b> end.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} held at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina on December 4, 2010. Charlotte was chosen after poor {{attendance}} at the game's previous locations (Tampa, Florida and Jacksonville, Florida) led conference officials to seek a location closer to the conference's geographic center. The 2010 championship {{was the first to}} be played in Charlotte, and <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>will</b> return to the city in 2011.|$|E
50|$|The closing {{ceremony}} of <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>will</b> {{take place on}} 27 September at the Olympic Stadium.|$|R

5|$|The next installment, also titled God of War, {{was officially}} {{announced}} at Sony's 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference with a gameplay trailer. The trailer showed a fully bearded Kratos, {{who now has}} a son, and Kratos is teaching the boy how to hunt. The end of the trailer showed the title God of War and confirmed it is in development for the PlayStation 4. Gameplay in the trailer showed elements similar to role playing games (RPG), such as archery knowledge points, {{as well as a}} Spartan Rage timed-ability during battle. <b>The</b> <b>game</b> <b>will</b> take place many years after the events of God of War III and will be set in the world of Norse mythology; a concept originally considered by David Jaffe after Kratos eliminated the Greek gods. Although further games have not been officially announced, Cory Barlog confirmed that this new installment would not be Kratos' last game. At E3 2017, another trailer was shown and it was confirmed that <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>will</b> release in early 2018.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, a wave of Luftwaffe {{aircraft}} (in the appearance of Balkenkreuz sprites on the map) will cross the English Channel and proceed to bomb various cities, air bases and radar installations. In response, RAF squadrons are automatically scrambled and will await orders to either engage invading Luftwaffe fighters or to defend key cities from bombers. When a RAF squadron has successfully engaged a Luftwaffe unit on the map, <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>will</b> shift to a first-person shooter perspective, in which the point of view is portrayed from a cockpit of either a Spitfire or Messerschmitt Bf 109, depending on the side chosen. During the dogfight sequence, the number of Luftwaffe casualties will depend on how many aircraft the player was able to shoot down.|$|E
5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Battles are turn-based and {{continue}} until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain experience and Gil; if it flees, it will be returned to the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>will</b> be over and all unsaved progress will be lost. Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters {{on the right side of}} the screen and the enemies on the left side of the screen, as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E
50|$|All <b>the</b> <b>games</b> <b>will</b> {{be played}} in Dar Es Salaam to allow easy TV {{coverage}} by Super Sport.|$|R

50|$|Thus, {{playing with}} Germany, <b>the</b> first two <b>games</b> <b>will</b> be Spain and France in some order, <b>the</b> second two <b>games</b> <b>will</b> be Netherlands and Brazil in some order, <b>the</b> third two <b>games</b> <b>will</b> be England and Italy in some order, and <b>the</b> seventh <b>game</b> <b>will</b> be Argentina. <b>The</b> <b>game</b> is {{completed}} when all seven other {{teams have been}} beaten. The level of difficulty increases <b>the</b> further <b>the</b> <b>game</b> progresses. <b>The</b> <b>game</b> notices when individual team players score a hat trick. Scoring hat tricks {{has the effect of}} increasing the difficulty as well.|$|R
5|$|During {{development}}, Square Enix {{did not pay}} Grin {{over several}} months, and disapproved of the game's Nordic art style. Grin worked to bring the game's art style closer to the Final Fantasy series, but {{after six months of}} development was told that no funding would ever come from Square Enix, and the developer filed for bankruptcy several days later. Word of the project leaked out through art portfolios of those who worked on the project and even a tech demo surfaced. In 2011, Fortress was thought to have been in development by an undisclosed studio, but this was also suspended and <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>will</b> not be released in any form.|$|E
5|$|Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance is a {{tactical}} role-playing video {{game in which}} players control protagonist Ike {{and a group of}} characters across multiple battle scenarios. At the game's opening, multiple difficulty settings can be chosen: in the Japanese version the options are Normal, Hard, and Maniac modes, while the western version has Easy, Normal, and Hard modes. In all modes, characters who fall in battle cannot be revived, being removed {{from the rest of the}} game, and no revival items can be used on them during a battle. If Ike falls in battle, <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>will</b> end and the stage must be restarted.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Deus Ex {{emphasizes}} player choice. Objectives can {{be completed}} in numerous ways, including stealth, sniping, heavy frontal assault, dialogue, or engineering and computer hacking. This level of freedom requires that levels, characters, and puzzles be designed with significant redundancy, as a single play-through of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> <b>will</b> miss large sections of dialogue, areas, and other content. In some missions, the player is encouraged to avoid using deadly force, and {{certain aspects of the}} story may change depending on how violent or non-violent the player chooses to be. The game is also unusual in that two of its boss villains can be killed off early in the game, or left alive to be defeated later, and this too affects how other characters interact with the player.|$|E
