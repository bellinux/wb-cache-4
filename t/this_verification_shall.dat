40|$|When testing {{mobile phone}} systems and {{especially}} when doing end-to-end testing, a central test is to check if a conversation is up between two mobiles. One {{way to do it}} is to ask the system if a connection is up between the mobiles. But the system can be wrong, so the end-to-end connection has to be verified in some other way. The most secure way to know if a connection is up is to check on the mobiles themselves if they really are connected. Then we can know for sure that a connection exists. Technology: The solution is to send “speech” through the microphone on one mobile and then listen on the speaker on the other, e. g. by sending DTMF signalling between the mobiles. An extension could be to do some kind of quality measuring of the “speech”. So called computer services could be implemented too. The exam work will contain some hardware to connect physically to the mobiles, but not very advanced, the larger part will be software. Our proposal is to build the solution with a Linux based computer with a multichannel soundcard for sending and receiving the signals. All verifying is to be done in software. The data generated from <b>this</b> <b>verification</b> <b>shall</b> be made available, via a serial interface, to other applications for analysis. A part of the exam work is placed on an investigation of whether this is a good method to solve the problem. The rest of the work is placed on implementation of chosen solution.

40|$|Abstract—The use of {{modeling}} languages such as UML or SysML enables to formally specify and verify {{the behavior of}} digital systems already {{in the absence of}} a specific implementation. However, for each modeling method and verification task usually a separate verification solution has to be applied today. In this paper, a methodology is envisioned that aims at stopping this “inflation ” of different verification approaches and instead employs a generic methodology. For this purpose, a given specification as well as the <b>verification</b> <b>shall</b> be transformed into a basic model which itself is specified by means of a generic modeling language. Then, a range of automatic reasoning engines shall uniformly be applied to perform the actual verification. A feasibility study demonstrates the applicability of the envisioned approach. I.

40|$|Abstract. We {{report on}} the {{inclusion}} of a formal method into an in-dustrial design process. Concretely, we suggest carrying out a verification step in railway interlocking design between programming the interlock-ing and testing this program. Safety still relies on testing, but the burden of guaranteeing completeness and correctness of the validation is in this way greatly reduced. We present a complete methodology for carrying out <b>this</b> <b>verification</b> step in the case of ladder logic programs and give re-sults for real world railway interlockings. As <b>this</b> <b>verification</b> step reduces costs for testing, Invensys Rail is working to include such a verification step into their design process of solid state interlockings. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to verify {{reachability}} properties of timed automata using SAT-based verification methods, while mainly eliminating the state explosion problem using abstraction refinement techniques. Especially for complex and safety critical systems, reachability analysis plays a major role, thus, <b>verification</b> <b>shall</b> be restricted to the system parts essential to the property. This thesis will present an iterative approach to automatic verification of reachability properties. While the essential, non-abstractable system parts have to be “guessed ” during the first cycle, from begin of the second {{it is possible to}} acces former results and identify wrongly omitted system parts to include them again. The timed automaton and the property are firstly translated into formulae, such that abstraction reduces to modification of formulae and these may be verified using a SAT-based model checker. Identification of wrongly omitted system parts and subsequent refinement are realised using craig interpolants resulting from false negatives. The efficiency and universality of this approach is shown using several examples...|$|R
