He added: [...] "It wasn't <b>that</b> <b>big</b> <b>of</b> a leap for us to go diaper. Our doctors are hardcore by nature." [...] Nowalk said that this episode was primarily focused around Shepherd, which he considered an [...] "experiment". He commented that the idea of Isaac's storyline came from Dr. Robert Bray, a neurosurgeon in Los Angeles. Nowalk intended the nature of the episode to be [...] "different", attributing it to the fact that Heigl's character was absent. He also praised Wilson for directing the episode, commenting that [...] "she acts, she sings, and now she directs". The majority of the episode involved Shepherd staring at his patient's tumor, contemplating what to do. Nowalk offered his insight on this: ...|$|E
500|$|Nick is {{described}} by the soap opera's official website as often thinking [...] "with his heart instead of his head". When the teenaged version of Nick debuted on the series in 1994, he was characterized as a [...] "frisky" [...] 16-year-old [...] "rich-kid", with Morrow being able to [...] "kick back and relax in typical teenager attire—jeans, tees, etc". Morrow said [...] "Nick's eager and fun-loving ... and that's fun to play". Nick also has an [...] "eye for the ladies". In 1999, Morrow told soap magazine Soap Opera Digest that Nick has a [...] "fiery personality", and [...] "if you attack him, he's going to fight back". Morrow has insisted {{that he is not}} concerned about viewer backlash towards Nick, having stated: [...] "My job is not to be palatable to the audience. I want to tell a convincing story. I have never been a man in love with two women. I can only imagine what that must be like." [...] The actor felt that if he needed to [...] "look like an ass and a bad guy" [...] to keep people interested in his portrayal, [...] "so be it". He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: [...] "I’d rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot of me in Nick, there is not <b>that</b> <b>big</b> <b>of</b> a stretch for me on a daily basis". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father. Morrow felt that Nick wants to teach Victor a lesson, hoping he will [...] "appreciate his children more". He also stated Nick wants to get respect, as he isn't [...] "this young and impressionable boy who looks at his father in this hero light anymore." [...] By the following year, Morrow opined that Nick is now [...] "more mature" [...] with his decision-making, and that [...] "He's got a very practical view of the world, and I like that he's kind of become a steady character on the show". He stated that although the part isn't as [...] "splashy or flashy" [...] as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), Nick's onscreen brother, he [...] "really" [...] likes Nick because [...] "he's a good dude" [...] and a [...] "very supportive" [...] person.|$|E
2500|$|Tiana is {{recognized}} for being Disney's first African American princess. As the film's writers and directors, Clements and Musker claim that {{their decision to}} depict Tiana as an African American young woman came naturally simply {{as a result of}} the location in which the story takes place. Clements explained, [...] "We didn't realize it was <b>that</b> <b>big</b> <b>of</b> a deal," [...] and originally gave the character the French name [...] "Madeleine"—"Maddy" [...] for short. However, when the name drew controversy and speculation as a result of alleged racial connotations—according to various sources, the name [...] "Maddy" [...] was commonly used as a [...] "slave name"—they decided to change it to the Greek name [...] "Tiana", which rhymes with [...] "Diana" [...] and [...] "" [...] (...) [...] Though [...] "Tiana" [...] (...) does not translate as [...] "princess" [...] (...) , it can be decoded as a portmanteau, coined by blending the princess names [...] and [...] Vying to continue to approach the film with sensitivity, Clements and Musker sought guidance from screenwriter Rob Edwards, who is African American. In order to add emotional weight to the story, Clements and Musker placed further emphasis on Tiana's relationship with her father, James, who originally [...] "wasn't as much in the picture." ...|$|E
