40|$|Children and youths' self-report {{of mental}} health {{problems}} is considered essential but complicated. This study examines {{the psychometric properties of}} <b>the</b> Dominic <b>Interactive,</b> a computerized DSM-IV based self-report questionnaire and explores informant correspondence. <b>The</b> Dominic <b>Interactive</b> was administered to 214 Dutch children, 6 - 11 year old, 122 attended special education schools and 92 children attended public schools. Within 2 weeks 155 children were reassessed. Parents of 211 children completed a paper version of <b>the</b> Dominic <b>Interactive.</b> <b>The</b> findings showed moderate to good internal consistency and test-retest reliability, although stability increased with age. Factor structure concerning generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder displayed ambiguous results. Comparing special education with public school children revealed that both parents and children in special education reported significantly more problems on almost all scales. The results on informant correspondence revealed that discrepancies in reports were not consistent across individual pairs; they were due to a few extreme cases. Eliminating these cases increased the agreement in reports. Although {{more research is needed to}} determine the value of <b>the</b> Dominic <b>Interactive,</b> <b>the</b> Dominic <b>Interactive</b> has <b>the</b> potential to contribute with its unique features to the existing self-report instruments for screening and assessing child mental health...|$|R

5|$|While it {{received}} little {{attention from the}} mainstream media, the game was immediately controversial among Americans {{on both sides of}} the political spectrum. The Anti-Defamation League, an anti-racist organization that especially covers anti-Semitism, publicized the existence of the game and unsuccessfully lobbied the developers of Genesis3D to change their licensing conditions to prohibit the use of the engine to develop racist games.

5|$|A {{major change}} from The Two Towers is <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> {{nature of the}} game environments. The player can operate machinery, for example bridges and catapults, to {{complete}} objectives, and use environmental objects as weapons, such as spears and cauldrons, to kill enemies. The levels are also {{twice the size of}} the largest level from The Two Towers and many are less linear. Unlike The Two Towers, The Return of the King features a co-op mode, allowing two players to play through the game together. The North American PlayStation 2 version also has an online multiplayer mode, with USB headset support, although this was removed from the European version of the game.|$|E

5|$|Cloud was {{designed}} and released in 2005 {{by a team of}} seven students in <b>the</b> <b>Interactive</b> Media master's degree program at the USC School of Cinematic Arts. The game was not made for a specific class. Development began in January 2005 and the game was released in late October, receiving its final update in December. The group was headed by Jenova Chen and included Stephen Dinehart, Erik Nelson, Aaron Meyers, Glenn Song, composer Vincent Diamante, and producer Kellee Santiago. The game won the 2005 Game Innovation Grant of $20,000 from the USC, which is intended to support the production of experimental games. The idea for the game was partially based on Chen's childhood experience, as he was often hospitalized for asthma and would daydream while waiting for the doctors.|$|E
5|$|During series two, the Torchwood website, www.torchwood.org.uk also hosted an {{interactive}} online game written by series writer Phil Ford. Updated weekly with the airing {{of the new}} episodes, the website features specially shot footage with Gareth David-Lloyd in character as Ianto debriefing and informing the 'player' with regards to their mission. Throughout both series one and two, <b>the</b> <b>interactive</b> websites co-written by James Goss featured electronic literature content (such as fictitious internet messaging conversations and letters) which depict aspects of Ianto and the other Torchwood characters' work and personal lives. The Torchwood Archives by Gary Russell collects much of this online literature in hardback form, along with new original material, some of which expands on what we know of Ianto. For example, it introduces his sister, Rhiannon and brother-in-law Johnny; Rhiannon and Johnny later appear in 2009's third televised series.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy VI: <b>The</b> <b>Interactive</b> CG Game (also {{known as}} the Final Fantasy SGI demo, or Final Fantasy x, {{not related to the}} actual 10th game in the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy X) was a short game demo {{produced}} by Square using characters and settings from Final Fantasy VI. Produced using new Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) Onyx workstations acquired by Square, the demo was Square's first foray into 3D graphics, and many assumed that it was a precursor to a new Final Fantasy title for the Nintendo 64 video game console, which also used SGI hardware. Square, however, had not yet committed to Nintendo's console {{at the time of the}} demo's production, and much of the technology demonstrated in the demo was later put to use in the rendering of FMV sequences for Final Fantasy VII and subsequent games for the PlayStation. The demo itself featured Terra Branford, Locke Cole, and Shadow in a series of battles. The game was controlled largely through mouse gestures: for example, moving the cursor in the shape of a star would summon a dragon to attack.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited II is {{a flight}} {{simulator}} video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting real-world planes. Players may control the Piper PA-28R-200, de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, Beechcraft Baron 58, North American P-51D Mustang or Cessna 172. <b>The</b> <b>interactive</b> cockpit of each plane {{is based on}} its real-world counterpart, and it contains simulated flight instruments such as an airspeed indicator, a heading indicator and a VOR indicator, among others. The player begins by engaging in a Quick Flight or by using the fixed-base operator (FBO) interface. In a Quick Flight, the player selects a plane and the flying conditions before taking off; the FBO interface features additional options, such as lessons, flight plans and adventures. The game's six lessons detail such maneuvers as takeoffs and taxiing. Adventures are pre-built missions, with objectives such as landing on an aircraft carrier, helping a prisoner to escape from Alcatraz Island or dropping turkeys into Candlestick Park. There are 25 adventures in total.|$|E
