5|$|The phase {{stability}} principle was tested {{with the old}} 37-inch cyclotron at Berkeley after McMillan returned to the Radiation Laboratory in September 1945. When it was found to work, the 184-inch cyclotron was similarly modified. He became a full professor in 1946. In 1954 he was appointed {{associate director of the}} Radiation Laboratory. He was promoted to deputy director in 1958. On the death of Lawrence that year, he became director, and he stayed in that position until his retirement in 1973. The laboratory was renamed <b>the</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Radiation Laboratory in 1958. In 1970, it split into <b>the</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Berkeley Laboratory and <b>the</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Livermore Laboratory, and McMillan became director of the former.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, {{he became}} a {{naturalized}} citizen of the United States. On his return to Berkeley in 1946, {{he became a}} professor of physics and of history of science, serving until 1972.

5|$|In 1958, {{scientists}} at <b>the</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Berkeley National Laboratory claimed {{the discovery of}} element 102, now called nobelium. At the same time, they also attempted to synthesize element 103 by bombarding the same curium target used with nitrogen-14 ions. A follow-up on this experiment was not performed, as the target was destroyed. Eighteen tracks were noted, with decay energy around (9±1)MeV and half-life around s; the Berkeley team noted that while the cause could be the production of an isotope of element 103, other possibilities could not be ruled out. While the data agrees reasonably with that later discovered for 257Lr (alpha decay energy 8.87MeV, half-life 0.6s), the evidence obtained in this experiment fell {{far short of the}} strength required to conclusively demonstrate the synthesis of element 103. Later, in 1960, <b>the</b> <b>Lawrence</b> Berkeley Laboratory attempted to synthesize the element by bombarding 252Cf with 10B and 11B. The results of this experiment were not conclusive.|$|E
