The A$2 billion Pacific Patrol Boat Replacement program (SEA 3036) (including A$594 million for construction and A$1.38 billion for through-life support costs) will replace the existing Pacific-class vessels, plus include East Timor as a new recipient. A request for tender was open to Australian shipbuilders on 5 March 2015, and concluded on 17 June. <b>Tenderers</b> are asked to submit proposals for a [...] steel-hull vessel with a range of [...] at , a top speed above , and an operational endurance of 20 days. The replacement patrol boats must be designed to commercial standards and easy to maintain. They will not be constructed with weapons fitted, but must be capable of having them installed later. Operation of the new patrol boats will be supplemented by aerial surveillance and intelligence from Australia, under the Pacific Maritime Security Program.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} extent to which {{equilibrium}} auction prices are pushed up sequentially due to strategic bidding behaviors in government land auction sales. Using a unique dataset that covers the universe of tendering prices submitted by all developers for all residential land auction sales in Singapore, we find that a <b>tenderer’s</b> bids are significantly higher where there was a previous land parcel sold within two years and located within four kilometers. The elevated price margin decreases with time and geographic distance. Tracking sequential bids submitted by same developers over time, we find that the incumbent winner of a previous auction often participates in subsequent nearby land sales but does not necessarily win the sites. We argue that the incumbent deliberately bids up the subsequent land prices to gain pricing advantages to their own parcels...|$|R
40|$|Abnormally low {{tender price}} {{with regard to}} the case law of {{administrative}} courts and the Office for the Protection of Competition Abnormally low tender price {{is one of the most}} problematic issues in public procurement law. The aim of this thesis is a detailed analysis of the concept of abnormally low tender price {{with regard to the}} case law of administrative courts and the Office for the Protection of Competition. The analysis is made both in relation to the Public Procurement act and the EU Directive on public procurement. After an introductory part the thesis is divided into seven main chapters. The first chapter outlines basic terms necessary for comprehensive analysis of further discussed issues. Chapter two deals with the concept of abnormally low tender price including its evolution in the former public procurement law. The third chapter focuses on the process of assessment of the tenders concerning the abnormally low tender price. This chapter deals with the request for explanation of the <b>tenderer's</b> tender price, with requirements of this explanation and with assessment of this explanation made by evaluation committee. Chapter four examines the zero tender price and the case law of administrative courts regarding the correct procedure in case of occurrence of this price. This chapter takes [...] ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} questions concerning modern contract lawyers is whether, and if so when, there may be a duty on parties to a contract to negotiate in good faith? This may seem an odd question for an English lawyer to raise, granted the refusal of the House of Lords in Walford v. Miles [1992] 2 A. C. 128 to recognise even the effectiveness of an agreement to negotiate in good faith but this case has not escaped cogent criticism (Neill (1992) 108 L. Q. R. 405) and it rests on an axiom (that this is a duty which cannot be enforced) which might appear self-evident if the plaintiff seeks specific performance but looks very different if what the plaintiff seeks is compensation for wasted expenditure. (Note that this was not what the plaintiff in Walford v. Miles sought.) It is often forgotten how expensive the contract making process can sometimes be. A good example arises where the contract is let by competitive tender. To bid accurately and successfully for a multi-million pound project may easily involve spending tens if not hundreds of thousands of pounds. The clear general rule is that such expenditure is for the <b>tenderer’s</b> account (in effect the successful tenders pay for the unsuccessful) but this assumes a fair tendering process...|$|R

50|$|Tenders {{were called}} in May 1879 and {{although}} local builders were among the <b>tenderers,</b> the contract was won by Brisbane builder Thomas Watson, probably as he was experienced in building court houses, primarily that at St Lawrence the previous year, which was similar in design.|$|E

5000|$|In December 2010, {{there was}} concern that {{government}} handling of the tender could be placing the process into doubt, with four <b>tenderers</b> out of the ten shortlisted having withdrawn. One of them, Bombardier Transportation, criticised the government for initially shortlisting four companies then extending it to ten, which in their view created a {{lack of confidence in}} the tendering process. Also criticised has been the fact that KiwiRail had [...] "effectively prevented" [...] their facilities in Hillside and Lower Hutt from tendering for the contract or parts of the contract, settling for encouraging overseas <b>tenderers</b> to include some local component. This, together with the refusal to allow local manufacturing to build railway wagons, was seen by groups such as unions and newspaper commenters as a sign that KiwiRail/the Government was unwilling to support New Zealand rail manufacturing.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>tenderers</b> {{for this}} second contract declined the offer {{and a second}} round was called. O'Rourke and McSharry submitted costings of £112,502.

5000|$|The tender {{process was}} {{completed}} in April 2015. A comprehensive tender evaluation found {{that none of the}} proposals received adequately met the tender criteria.
