5|$|At the back, the nasals are {{separated}} by <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> in K. langenbergensis, the back third of which is somewhat vaulted. The portion of <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> between the eyes is one-third {{the width of the}} entire skull in both species, but it widens further back to form the front of the skull roof. The prefrontal is straight along its contact with <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> and nasal (about half of the bone is in contact with each), but forms an angle between the margin of the eye socket and the lacrimal on the other side. This angle is rounded in K. guimarotae such that the bone is oval-shaped, but very pointed in K. langenbergensis such that the bone is triangular.|$|E
5|$|The scales {{along the}} lips of the snake are called labials. Those on the upper lip are called supralabials or upper labials, while those on the lower lip are called infralabials or lower labials. On top of the head, between the eyes, {{adjacent}} to the supraoculars is <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> scale. The prefrontal scales are the scales connected to <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> towards {{the tip of the}} snout which are in contact with the internasals. They may have a scale in between them. The back of {{the top of the head}} has scales connected to <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> scale called the parietal scales. At the sides of the back of the head between the parietals above and the supralabials below are scales called temporal scales.|$|E
5|$|Carnotaurus is {{the only}} known {{carnivorous}} bipedal animal {{with a pair of}} horns on <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> bone. The use of these horns is not entirely clear; several interpretations have revolved around use in fighting conspecifics, in display, or in killing prey.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{superior}} <b>frontal</b> sulcus is a sulcus between <b>the</b> superior <b>frontal</b> gyrus and <b>the</b> middle <b>frontal</b> gyrus.|$|R
50|$|The {{borders of}} <b>the</b> middle <b>frontal</b> gyrus are <b>the</b> {{inferior}} <b>frontal</b> sulcus below; <b>the</b> superior <b>frontal</b> sulcus above; and the precentral sulcus behind.|$|R
50|$|Snake scales {{attached}} to <b>the</b> <b>frontals</b> {{and to its}} anterior are called prefrontals.|$|R
5|$|Each {{hemisphere}} is conventionally {{divided into}} four lobes; <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe, named according to the skull bones that overlie them. Each lobe is associated {{with one or two}} specialised functions though there is some functional overlap between them.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is long. The nasal {{bones are}} short, with their back margin not {{extending}} beyond the lacrimal bones, {{which are in}} contact with both the maxillary and frontal bones. The zygomatic notch is moderately developed and the jugal bone is small, so that when seen from the side the maxillary and squamosal parts of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) overlap. Usually, the suture (line of fusion) between <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> and the squamosal is continuous with that between <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> and the parietal bone. In T.talamancae, the parietals usually extend {{from the roof of}} the braincase broadly on to the sides, but in T.bolivaris they are more commonly restricted to the roof.|$|E
5|$|Majungasaurus {{is perhaps}} most {{distinctive}} for its skull ornamentation, including the swollen and fused nasals and <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> horn. Other ceratosaurs, including Carnotaurus, Rajasaurus, and Ceratosaurus itself bore crests on the head. These structures {{are likely to have}} played a role in intraspecific competition, although their exact function within that context is unknown. The hollow cavity inside <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> horn of Majungasaurus would have weakened the structure and probably precluded its use in direct physical combat, although the horn may have served a display purpose. While there is variation in the ornamentation of Majungasaurus individuals, there is no evidence for sexual dimorphism.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} osteological {{characters}} of Taverneichthys bikanericus from the continental Paleocene of India are studied, allowing specifying its systematic {{position within the}} Osteoglossidae. It is shown that {{on the basis of}} its peculiar snout morphology this species occupies an intermediate position between genera such as Chanopsis and Phareodus, which possess a primitive snout with a large dermethmoid reaching <b>the</b> <b>frontals</b> and separating <b>the</b> two nasals from each other, and such as Brychaetus, Musperia, Opsithrissops, Osteoglossum and Scleropages, which exhibit an evolved snout. The latter presents nasals, which are articulated to <b>the</b> <b>frontals,</b> meeting each other on the mid-line, except at their anterior edge, where a small dermethmoid, largely separated from <b>the</b> <b>frontals,</b> is inserted between...|$|R
50|$|Arbour {{noted in}} 2014 that the foot in fact had three toes. She {{established}} a single autapomorphy: on <b>the</b> <b>frontals,</b> at <b>the</b> middle skull roof, a raised V- shaped region is present. Also she determined that Talarurus differed from all known ankylosaurids {{with the exception}} of the American Nodocephalosaurus in the possession of caputegulae, head armour tiles, on <b>the</b> <b>frontals</b> and nasals, that are cone-shaped with a circular base.|$|R
5|$|Three of the skulls {{displayed}} {{evidence that}} they had experienced violence; a probable adult female had an unhealed injury on <b>the</b> left <b>frontal</b> bone, an adult of indeterminate sex had an unhealed fracture on <b>the</b> left <b>frontal,</b> and a second adult female had a healed depressed fracture on <b>the</b> right <b>frontal.</b>|$|R
5|$|Some {{evidence}} of early evolutionary {{history is the}} structure of the antennal heart, a separate circulatory organ consisting of two ampullae, or vesicles, that are attached to <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> cuticle to the bases of the antennae. These features have not been found in other insects. An independent organ exists for each antenna, consisting of an ampulla, attached to <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> cuticle medial to the antenna base and forming a thin-walled sac with a valved ostium on its ventral side. They pump blood by elastic connective tissue, rather than muscle.|$|E
5|$|All true {{caterpillars}} have an upside-down Y-shaped {{line that}} runs {{from the top of}} the head downward. In between the Y-shaped line lies <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> triangle or frons. The clypeus, located below the frons, lies between the two antennae. The labrum is found below the clypeus. There is a small notch in the centre of the labrum with which the leaf edge engages when the caterpillar eats.|$|E
5|$|Burnside fought at {{the battles}} of Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court House, {{where he did}} not perform in a {{distinguished}} manner, attacking piecemeal and appearing reluctant to commit his troops to <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> assaults that characterized these battles. After North Anna and Cold Harbor, he took {{his place in the}} siege lines at Petersburg.|$|E
50|$|BA10 is a {{subdivision}} of <b>the</b> cytoarchitecturally defined <b>frontal</b> region of cerebral cortex. It occupies the most rostral portions of <b>the</b> superior <b>frontal</b> gyrus and <b>the</b> middle <b>frontal</b> gyrus. In humans, on the medial {{aspect of the}} hemisphere it is bounded ventrally by the superior rostral sulcus. It does not extend {{as far as the}} cingulate sulcus. Cytoarchitecturally it is bounded dorsally by <b>the</b> granular <b>frontal</b> area 9, caudally by <b>the</b> middle <b>frontal</b> area 46, and ventrally by the orbital area 47 and by the rostral area 12 or, in an early version of Brodmann's cortical map (Brodmann-1909), the prefrontal Brodmann area 11-1909.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{inferior}} <b>frontal</b> {{junction area}} {{is an area}} of the brain located at the junction of <b>the</b> inferior <b>frontal</b> sulcus and <b>the</b> inferior precentral sulcus.|$|R
40|$|The author {{describes}} the snout osteology of the fossil Osteoglossidae Phareodus and Brychaetus. He {{shows that the}} two genera considerably differ in their naso-ethmoid region. Indeed, Phareodus encaustus and P. queenslandicus possess a large dermethmoid contacting <b>the</b> <b>frontals</b> and separating <b>the</b> two nasals from each other, which is the primitive condition within teleosts. P. testis {{is a little more}} specialized. Its dermethmoid still separates partially the two nasals but it begins to lose its contact with <b>the</b> <b>frontals.</b> On <b>the</b> contrary, Brychaetus muelleri exhibits a specialized snout pattern. The two nasals, articulated with <b>the</b> <b>frontals,</b> are joined together on almost their entire length, except at their anterior edge where a small dermethmoid, largely separated from <b>the</b> <b>frontals,</b> is inserted between them, as in Osteoglossum and Scleropages. Thus, Brychaetus is a valid genus and not a synonym of Phareodus. The author also shows that the osteoglossid Musperia radiata, from the Eocene of Indonesia, displays the same advanced snout pattern as Brychaetus and the two Recent Osteoglossidae. The caudal skeleton of Musperia is described for the first time. The first preural and the first ural centra bear complete neural spines. The five hypurals are autogenous. There is a pair of uroneurals and no epural...|$|R
5|$|Impaired {{judgment}} is not specific to any diagnosis {{but may be}} a prominent feature of disorders affecting <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> lobe of the brain. If a person's {{judgment is}} impaired due to mental illness, there might be implications for the person's safety or the safety of others.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} week of December, a frontal trough stalled south of Bermuda. An upper level {{disturbance}} moved over the area on December 9, and produced widespread convection along <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> wave. The system moved to the northeast, and based on a developing circulation within the convection, the National Hurricane Center classified the system as a subtropical storm on December 12 while located 275miles (440km) northeast of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is {{relatively}} long and line-shaped. The central groove in the nasal depression {{is relatively}} narrow. <b>The</b> <b>frontal</b> bones are slightly rounded and bear a prominent sagittal crest. Further {{back on the}} braincase, the lambdoid crest is also prominent. The middle part of the palate is concave, not flat as in M.aelleni and M.manavi. At the palate's back margin is a long, thin posterior palatal spine.|$|E
50|$|The prefrontal {{scales on}} snakes and other {{reptiles}} are the scales connected to <b>the</b> <b>frontals</b> towards <b>the</b> {{tip of the}} snout which are in contact with the internasals.|$|R
40|$|Three partial skulls of odontocetes {{from the}} Miocene of Antwerp and Kessel, {{northern}} Belgium (southern North Sea Basin) are described {{here as a}} new genus and species of beaked whale (Ziphiidae), Archaeoziphius microglenoideus. This small new whale {{is one of the}} most archaic beaked whales, because of its low vertex, thin and laterally directed premaxillary crests, low contact between the supraoccipital and <b>the</b> <b>frontals</b> on <b>the</b> vertex, and its free atlas. It is also characterized by the strong transverse compression of <b>the</b> <b>frontals</b> on <b>the</b> vertex and a reduced glenoid surface on the squamosal; the two last characters might be considered as derived. Nasals wider than <b>the</b> <b>frontals</b> on <b>the</b> vertex might group A. microglenoideus with the extant larger genera Berardius and Tasmacetus; <b>the</b> nodular <b>frontals</b> and <b>the</b> premaxillary crests are more similar to the condition in Berardius. A sediment sample from the cetacean-bearing strata at Kessel is dated with dinoflagellate cysts as middle Miocene, tentatively late Langhian to early Serravallian, i. e., from ca. 15 Ma to ca. 13. 2 Ma. Archaeoziphius microglenoideus is therefore the oldest reported beaked whale known by cranial material...|$|R
30|$|High hostile {{men will}} have {{increased}} sympathetic arousal, {{as measured by}} glucose, {{as a function of}} <b>the</b> right <b>frontal</b> stressor (RFFT) and will have decreased responses to <b>the</b> left <b>frontal</b> stressor (COWAT).|$|R
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is rounded. The central groove in {{the nasal}} {{depression}} is relatively narrow. <b>The</b> <b>frontal</b> bones are inflated and bear a prominent sagittal crest. Further {{back on the}} braincase, the lambdoid crest is poorly developed. The middle part of the palate is flat, not concave as in M.brachytragos, M.griveaudi, and M.mahafaliensis. At the palate's back margin is a short, thick posterior palatal spine.|$|E
5|$|Most capable Soviet tank at Kursk was the T-34, the {{original}} version was armed with a 76.2mm gun, the gun struggled against uparmoured Panzer IVs, and <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> armour of Tigers and Panthers was essentially impenetrable. Only SU-122 and the SU-152 {{had the power to}} destroy the Tiger at short range, but they were not equal to the Tiger's 88mm gun at long range, and there were very few SU-122 and the SU-152 at Kursk.|$|E
5|$|Overnight, all {{convection}} in Chantal dissipated, and its {{forward speed}} decreased as it {{headed to the}} north. A weak wave caused Chantal to speed up and the system was absorbed in <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> system by the night of September 14. Effects on Bermuda were minimal, with the island getting winds of up to 20mph (25km/h) and few thundershowers. Chantal generated swells of 30–40ft (9–12m) offshore.|$|E
50|$|The {{orbits of}} Dissorophus are {{relatively}} large, circular, and oriented dorsally than laterally. As DeMar describes, the orbits are {{large enough to}} intersect with <b>the</b> <b>frontals,</b> palatines, post orbitals, lacrimals, and jugals.|$|R
50|$|Wysocki's team {{noted that}} {{in all but one}} case, the {{fracture}} morphologies are consistent with dry-bone breakage.Three of the skulls displayed evidence that they had experienced violence; a probable adult female had an unhealed injury on <b>the</b> left <b>frontal,</b> an adult of indeterminate sex had an unhealed fracture on <b>the</b> left <b>frontal,</b> and a second adult female had a healed depressed fracture on <b>the</b> right <b>frontal.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mixocetus is a large-size mysticete with a long, narrow rostrum, {{a robust}} braincase, a nostril opening {{extending}} posteriorly {{just a few}} inches behind the antorbital processes, the posterior ends of the premaxillae, maxillae, and nasals tapering and extending posteriorly to a point between superior parts of supraorbital processes of <b>the</b> <b>frontals,</b> and a temporal fossa opening dorsally. Unlike Cetotherium, the antorbital process is larger, the lateral margins of the supraoccipital processes of <b>the</b> <b>frontals</b> are parallel to each other, there is a protruding lateral wall of the braincase, and the rear portion of the cranium has a very thick and posteriorly protruding exoccipital.|$|R
5|$|Some noctuid moths, such as {{the large}} red underwing (Catocala nupta), are cryptic at rest, but display a flash of startlingly bright colours when disturbed. Others, such as many species of genus Speiredonia and Spirama, look {{threatening}} while at rest. Also saturniid moths of the genera Attacus and Rothschildia display snake heads, but not from <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> position.|$|E
5|$|Stela 2 is {{believed}} to date to around AD 870 although it bears no hieroglyphic text. It depicts <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> view of a masked figure {{and is the only}} monument at Seibal to show a frontal portrayal. It was broken into six or seven pieces and has been restored.|$|E
5|$|Termites rely {{on alarm}} {{communication}} {{to defend a}} colony. Alarm pheromones can be released when the nest has been breached or is being attacked by enemies or potential pathogens. Termites always avoid nestmates infected with Metarhizium anisopliae spores, through vibrational signals released by infected nestmates. Other methods of defence include intense jerking and secretion of fluids from <b>the</b> <b>frontal</b> gland and defecating faeces containing alarm pheromones.|$|E
50|$|Classified as a tyrannosaurine, Nanuqsaurus is {{diagnosed}} by: a thin, rostrally forked, median {{spur of the}} fused parietals on the dorsal skull roof that overlaps and separates <b>the</b> <b>frontals</b> within <b>the</b> sagittal crest, <b>frontals</b> with a long, rostrally pointed process separating the prefrontal and lacrimal facets and that the first two dentary teeth are {{much smaller than the}} dentary teeth behind them.|$|R
50|$|This area is {{also known}} as the pars triangularis (of <b>the</b> {{inferior}} <b>frontal</b> gyrus). In humans, it occupies the triangular part of <b>the</b> inferior <b>frontal</b> gyrus (H) and, surrounding the anterior horizontal limb of the lateral sulcus (H), a portion of the orbital part of <b>the</b> inferior <b>frontal</b> gyrus (H). Bounded caudally by the anterior ascending limb of the lateral sulcus (H), it borders on the insula in the depth of the lateral sulcus.|$|R
