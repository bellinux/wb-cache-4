5|$|A {{nurse at}} Dalldorf, Thea Malinovsky, claimed {{years after the}} patient's release from the asylum <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> had {{told her she was}} another {{daughter}} of the Tsar, Anastasia, in the autumn of 1921. However, the patient herself could not recall the incident. Her biographers either ignore Malinovsky's claim, or weave it into their narrative.|$|E
5|$|Detectives {{noted in}} {{released}} court documents <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> had “significant bruising to her upper arms consistent with being restrained” and “small abrasions to her knuckles that were scabbed over.” Wacław Kiełtyka told detectives he saw both Piotrowski and Więcek engaged in sex acts {{with the woman}} in the bathroom, while Łysejko and Więcek denied witnessing the incident, and Piotrowski refused comment.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "The Thresher's Labour," [...] Stephen Duck {{mentions}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> did {{not contribute}} much during the harvests (the hardest time of the year). Duck portrays the workers as strong men, covered in dust from their work, while mentioning <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> are at home {{taking care of the}} children.|$|R

5000|$|Cowboy U has {{received}} some criticism, mainly for being, to some, sexist. Critics said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> {{are portrayed as}} [...] "materialistic and prissy". The critics also said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> are depicted differently in the competition than the men are, along with focusing on animal rights issues, and <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> there aren't many female ranch hands on the show.|$|R
5|$|During the TGS afterparty, new {{cast member}} Danny Baker (Cheyenne Jackson) admits to his boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), {{that he has}} been having an office romance but will not {{disclose}} the woman's name. While in attendance at a New York Knicks game, Jack asks more about the woman Danny is seeing and Danny reveals details, such as she has never let a man see her feet. This results in Jack's realization <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> is the show's head writer, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), and he is displeased.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Agent Leyla Harrison (Jolie Jenkins) tells Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) about a {{woman who}} stabbed herself repeatedly. Harrison insists that the case is an X-File and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> was killed by monsters that her son Tommy saw. She also {{believes}} that the monster killed the family cat, Spanky. Although Scully dismisses Harrison's claims, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) decide to investigate.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back in the}} restaurant, the {{waitress}} returns to find the woman missing. Believing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> has left without paying the bill, she angrily crumples and throws the woman's comic book into a bin. This makes the hero's two opposing racers reappear, armed with a large pipe wrench. The racers smash the looking glass with the pipe wrench, trapping {{the woman in the}} comic book. The hero punches one of the thugs and retreats with the woman into a maze of paper. Arriving at a dead end, he tears a hole in the paper wall so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> can escape as the menacing opposing racers close in on him. The woman, now back in the real world and found lying beside the bin to the surprise of restaurant guests and staff, retrieves the comic from the bin and runs home, where she attempts to smooth out the creases to learn what happens next.|$|E
5000|$|In Mark <b>the</b> fearful <b>women</b> flee, but in Matthew {{they merely}} run. Mark also reports <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> were so frightened {{that they said}} nothing. Matthew, and Luke, reverse this and state <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> ran and told the disciples. St. Augustine noticed this contradiction, but {{reconciled}} it by arguing that Mark's claim is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> nothing to <b>the</b> angel, not the disciples. France also agrees that Mark did not intend the women's silence to be permanent, as it would violate the command to tell the disciples. Since the original ending of Mark, {{if there was a}} different one, is now lost {{it is impossible to know}} what was meant by the line about the women's silence.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>women</b> {{soldiers}} were rigorously trained, given uniforms, and equipped with Danish guns (obtained via the slave trade). By the mid-19th century, they numbered between 1,000 and 6,000 women, {{about a third}} of the entire Dahomey army, according to reports written by visitors. The reports also noted variously <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> soldiers suffered several defeats, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> {{soldiers were}} consistently judged to be superior to the male soldiers in effectiveness and bravery.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Judge held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> were {{entitled}} to damages which would be determined at a later date.|$|R
5|$|Before Christmas' escape attempt, Hightower {{delivers}} Lena's {{child in}} the cabin where Brown and Christmas had been staying before the murder, and Byron arranges for Brown/Burch {{to come and see}} her. Brown deserts Lena once again, but Byron follows him and challenges him to a fight. Brown beats the braver, smaller Bunch, then skilfully hops a moving train and disappears. At the end of the story, an anonymous man is talking to his wife about two strangers he picked up on a trip to Tennessee, recounting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> had a child and the man was not the father. This was Lena and Byron, who were conducting a half-hearted search for Brown, and they are eventually dropped off in Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Beshear and Abramson easily {{defeated}} Farmer and Williams, carrying 90 of Kentucky's 120 counties. Days later, the Lexington Herald-Leader {{reported that}} Farmer had placed his girlfriend in a non-merit agriculture department job on October 31, 2011. Williams confirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> was Farmer's girlfriend, but denied knowledge {{that she had}} been put on the state payroll. Farmer defended the hiring, saying his girlfriend was qualified for the job, which involved administrative and clerical tasks, and that his legal team had assured him that he had followed all appropriate hiring regulations. Farmer's successor, Republican James Comer, fired Farmer's girlfriend a day after being sworn into office.|$|E
5|$|Briam tells Kamala {{to stay in}} her quarters, but Captain Picard {{allows her}} to travel {{throughout}} the ship, with the unaffected Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) as her escort. This results in a fight nearly breaking out in Ten Forward, when Kamala begins to interact with several miners. The Ferengi seek to bribe Briam to turn Kamala over to them, but he rejects their offer. As he leaves, they attack him, causing him to fall, hit his head, and lose consciousness. The Enterprise turns the Ferengi over to the nearest starbase to stand trial, but Briam is unable {{to participate in the}} ceremony. Kamala helps Picard to take on Briam's role, and the two become close. He seeks to resist her abilities and tells her to be herself, and she explains <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> he wants her to be is who she actually is.|$|E

5|$|Forum members whose ruses are {{discovered}} by their support groups are frequently banned from such communities—sometimes after demanding that site administrators do so—moving to other websites to display other ailments. Denise Grady noted in The New York Times <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> with the eating disorder {{moved to a}} group for sexual abuse survivors then another where she claimed to be dying of AIDS. An article in The Weekend Australian highlighted {{an example of this}} in 2003: a woman in London admitted to belonging to online support forums dedicated to helping members cope with migraines, grieving over dead children, and breast cancer, all at the same time. She told a psychiatrist that she would study a specific malady and subsequently present herself with its symptoms; her time at each forum followed a daily schedule. Others disappear and simply stop posting, such as the monk who claimed to have cancer.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the {{original}} autograph manuscripts of the Nos. 3 to 6 {{of the set}} were discovered at a festival arranged in Melbourne, Australia, for the 250th anniversary of Haydn's birth. After a concert at the festival, a woman presented the manuscripts in a plastic shopping bag to the conductor Christopher Hogwood. The Haydn scholar Georg Feder, who was visiting Australia at the time, then verified the scores to be the authentic original manuscripts of the four quartets. It emerged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> who presented the manuscripts to Hogwood had inherited them, through successive generations, from an English colonel who had purchased them at an 1851 auction before emigrating to New Zealand. The colonel's heirs were evidently unaware that they owned the only original versions of the quartets in Haydn's pen. Until the 1982 discovery, publishers had been working from incomplete or non-original editions.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Lone Hvass of the Elsinore Museum, Miranda Aldhouse-Green of Cardiff University, and the Department of Forensic Science at the University of Århus {{performed}} a re-examination of the Haraldskær Woman. Forensic analysis revealed stomach contents of unhusked millet and blackberries. Her neck had a faint groove {{as if someone}} applied a rope for torture or strangulation. The scientists concluded bog acids caused the swelling of the knee joint and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> was probably already dead before the branches pinned her down. Because of her careful placement, and since cremation was the prevailing mode of interment during that period in Jutland, the examiners guess the Haraldskær Woman {{was a victim of}} ritual sacrifice.|$|E
50|$|At {{the wedding}} night, Gopalakrishnan says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> lied but Radha {{does not believe}} him. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> was forced to lie because Loose Gounder raped her before and he had promised to marry her. Loose Gounder kills her and Gopalakrishnan goes to her house. Radha thinks <b>that</b> Gopalakrishnan killed <b>the</b> <b>woman.</b>|$|R

5|$|Major {{public works}} {{projects}} financed with deficit spending included {{the construction of a}} network of Autobahns and providing funding for programmes initiated by the previous government for housing and agricultural improvements. To stimulate the construction industry, credit was offered to private businesses and subsidies were made available for home purchases and repairs. On the condition that the wife would leave the workforce, a loan of up to 1,000 Reichsmarks could be accessed by young couples of Aryan descent who intended to marry and the amount that had to be repaid was reduced by 25 percent for each child born. The caveat <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> had to remain unemployed was dropped by 1937 due to a shortage of skilled labourers.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns {{has all of}} his {{employees}} clean up a highway maintained by his company. Not wishing to waste his Saturday, Homer fakes his death. The next day, Marge finds out and orders Homer {{to go to the}} Springfield Hall of Records to explain himself. While sorting out the problem, Homer gets into an argument with a clerk who claims that Homer's mother is still alive, in spite of Homer's belief that she died while he was young. Homer visits what he believes is her grave, only to discover that it belongs to Walt Whitman. Nearby, he sees his own grave and falls into it. A woman approaches and chastises Homer for falling into her son's grave. Homer realizes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> is his mother, Mona, and the two have an emotional reunion.|$|E
5|$|Olivia (Anna Torv) {{dreams that}} she pushes {{a woman in}} front of a subway train at Grand Central Terminal, but assumes it was just in her head. In the morning however, the news reports <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> killed herself with the train. Walter (John Noble) puts forth various theories, such as astral projection, while Peter (Joshua Jackson) thinks it was still just a dream. Olivia is unconvinced, and goes with the Fringe team to investigate. An NYPD officer (April Grace) escorts them to the crime scene, and Peter sees a red balloon {{floating}} and begins to believe her, as Olivia had described the balloon to him previously.|$|E

2500|$|Thirty {{pregnant}} {{women who had}} been arrested pursuant to the policy brought suit in federal court, challenging the MUSC policy of conducting warrantless, nonconsensual drug testing as violating their Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. [...] The hospital and the city raised two primary defensesfirst, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> had consented to the searches; and second, that even if they had not consented, the searches were reasonable {{as a matter of law}} because they were justified by [...] "special non-law-enforcement purposes." [...] The district court rejected the second defense because it concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> searches were conducted for law enforcement purposes. [...] It submitted the first defense to the jury, instructing <b>the</b> jury <b>that</b> if <b>the</b> jury found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> had consented, <b>the</b> jury should rule for the city and the hospital. [...] <b>The</b> jury found <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> had consented, and thus ruled for the city and the hospital. [...] <b>The</b> <b>women</b> appealed.|$|R
5|$|Ritter leaves Scully {{staking out}} Fellig's apartment, but Scully is unnerved {{when she sees}} Fellig {{shooting}} photos of her out his window and bangs on his door, demanding to know how he took photos {{at a crime scene}} before the police even knew the crime had been committed. He invites her to take a ride with him so he can show her. After driving, he sees a prostitute who appears to be gray to him. Fellig tells Scully <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> will be dead very soon. A pimp approaches the woman and begins to harass her. Scully leaps out of the car with her gun, announcing that she is an FBI agent and handcuffing the pimp, but when the prostitute tries to flee, she is hit by a truck and killed.|$|E
5|$|Some {{participants}} {{tried to}} track Russian down {{to have their}} questions answered. One contestant, Louise Miles, discovered that Russian's production company, NRP, did not actually exist and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> who had been answering their phone calls was really Russian's mother, Margaret. Another participant, Daniel Pope, managed to track Russian down to an address in Richmond upon Thames and convinced him {{to be interviewed by}} Christmas TV and apologise on camera. As Russian had not actually taken money from his victims, he had not committed a crime, and a civil case was not pursued {{due to a lack of}} funds.|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} of the woman {{has also been a}} matter of debate. The inscription which accompanies her image clearly includes her title, despotissa, as well as the word “daughter”. Based on a possible reading of her name as Anna, she has been identified as Anna Neda, the Serbian wife of Michael Shishman, which is in line with the first identification of the despot. Nikolova believes that it is possible <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> is Anna Neda even if the despot is her son rather than her husband. She theorises that Anna Neda settled in Vidin after Michael Shishman's second marriage and owned a personal domain which included Donja Kamenica. Another reading of the inscription deciphers the name of the despotissa as Elena.|$|E
