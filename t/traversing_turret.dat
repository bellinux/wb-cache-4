5|$|The nine {{remaining}} gliders transporting {{the airborne}} troops assigned to Group Granite successfully {{landed on the}} roof of Fort Eben-Emael, using arrester-parachutes to slow their descent and rapidly bring them to a halt. The airborne troops rapidly emerged from the gliders and began attaching explosive charges to those emplacements {{on the top of the}} Fort which housed the artillery pieces that could target the three captured bridges. In the southern part of the Fort, Objective No. 18, an artillery observation casemate housing three 75mm artillery pieces was damaged with a light demolition charge and then permanently destroyed with a heavier charge, which collapsed the casemate's observation dome and part of the roof of the Fort itself. Objective No. 12, a <b>traversing</b> <b>turret</b> holding two more artillery pieces was also destroyed by airborne troops, who then moved to Objective No. 26, a turret holding another three 75mm weapons; although explosives were detonated against this and the airborne troops assigned to destroy it moved off, this proved to be premature as one of the guns was rapidly brought to bear against the attackers, who were forced to assault it for a second time to destroy it. Another pair of 75mm guns in a cupola was disabled, as was a barracks known to house Belgian troops. However, attempts to destroy Objective No. 24 proved to be less successful; the objective, twin turrets with heavy-calibre guns mounted on a rotating cupola, was too large for airborne troops from a single glider to destroy on their own, forcing troops from two gliders to be used. Primitive unlined shaped charges were affixed to the turrets and detonated, but whilst they shook the turrets they did not destroy them, and other airborne troops were forced to climb the turrets and smash the gun barrels.|$|E
50|$|A final {{attempt to}} exploit a fully <b>traversing</b> <b>turret</b> {{was found in}} the {{original}} 1948 design of the Curtiss-Wright XF-87 Blackhawk all-weather jet fighter interceptor. Armament was to be a nose-mounted, powered turret containing four 20 mm (.79 in) cannon, but this installation was only fitted to the mock-up and never incorporated in the two prototypes.|$|E
50|$|The Sd Kfz 222 {{was fitted}} with heavier {{armament}} and larger turret than the Sd Kfz 221 {{but it was}} still comparatively cramped and lacked top protection other than a wire screen designed to allow grenades to roll off, but this made using the main armament problematic. Co-axially mounted with the machine gun both weapons were pintle-mounted, and fitted with an elevation and traverse mechanism and floor-mounted firing mechanisms. The turret was rotated by the traversing weapons rather than the weapons being fixed to a <b>traversing</b> <b>turret.</b> There was thus no bearing-ring and no turret basket, only a fighting compartment largely obstructed by the breaches of the weapons.|$|E

50|$|In {{the wake}} of Germany's {{successful}} 1939-41 campaigns, US armour doctrine had incorporated the idea of fast, lightly armoured vehicles carrying high velocity anti-tank guns {{as the best way}} to deal with the fast moving armour spearheads of the German Blitzkrieg. The M10 was based on the chassis of the M4 Sherman but carried thinner although more sloped armour in order to comply with the high speed requirement for the tank. At the same time, the British had been examining the possibility of designing a low-silhouette self-propelled tank destroyer, preferably with a 360-degree <b>traversing</b> <b>turret,</b> with armour that would be able to resist the German 50 mm at 800 yards and mounting the 17 pounder. However, with the arrival of the M10 on the battlefield in late 1942, British plans for a turreted self-propelled gun were cancelled.|$|E
5000|$|An {{anti-aircraft}} vehicle, {{also known}} as a self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon (SPAA) or self-propelled air defense system (SPAD), is a mobile vehicle with a dedicated anti-aircraft capability. The Russian equivalent of SPAAG is ZSU (from zenitnaya samokhodnaya ustanovka - [...] "anti-aircraft self-propelled mount"). Specific weapon systems used include machine guns, autocannons, larger guns, or missiles, and some mount both guns and longer-ranged missiles. Platforms used include both trucks and heavier combat vehicles such as APCs and tanks, which add protection from aircraft, artillery, and small arms fire for front line deployment. Anti-aircraft guns are usually mounted in a quickly <b>traversing</b> <b>turret</b> with a high rate of elevation, for tracking fast-moving aircraft. They are often in dual or quadruple mounts, allowing a high rate of fire. Today, missiles (generally mounted on similar turrets) have largely supplanted anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
50|$|The M4 Sherman {{evolved from}} the M3 Medium Tank, which had its main {{armament}} in a side sponson mount. The M4 retained much of the previous mechanical design, but put the main 75 mm gun in a fully <b>traversing</b> <b>turret.</b> One feature, a one-axis gyrostabilizer, was not precise enough to allow firing when moving but did help keep the reticle on target, {{so that when the}} tank did stop to fire, the gun would be aimed in roughly the right direction. The designers stressed mechanical reliability, ease of production and maintenance, durability, standardization of parts and ammunition in a limited number of variants, and moderate size and weight. These factors, combined with the Sherman's then-superior armor and armament, outclassed German light and medium tanks fielded in 1939-42. The M4 went on to be produced in large numbers. It spearheaded many offensives by the Western Allies after 1942.|$|E
50|$|All guns have {{carriages}} or mountings {{that support}} the barrel assembly (called the ordnance in some countries). Early guns could only be traversed by moving their entire carriage or mounting, and this lasted with heavy artillery into World War II. Mountings could be fitted into <b>traversing</b> <b>turrets</b> on ships, coast defences or tanks. From circa 1900 field artillery carriages provided traverse without moving the wheels and trail.|$|R
50|$|The first Panthers (Ausf D) had a {{hydraulic}} motor that could <b>traverse</b> the <b>turret</b> at a maximum {{rate of one}} complete revolution in one minute, independent of engine speed. This was improved in the Ausf A model with {{a hydraulic}} traverse that varied with engine speed; one full turn taking 46 seconds at an engine speed of 1,000 rpm but only 15 seconds if the engine was running at 3,000 rpm. This arrangement was a weakness, as <b>traversing</b> the Panther's <b>turret</b> rapidly onto a target required close coordination between the gunner and driver, who had to run the engine to maximum speed. By comparison, the M4 Sherman's electrically <b>traversed</b> <b>turret</b> rotated at up to 360 degrees in 15 seconds and was independent of engine speed, which gave it an advantage over the Panther in close-quarters combat. A hand traverse wheel was provided for the Panther gunner to make fine adjustment of his aim.|$|R
2500|$|By early August, four [...] <b>traversing</b> <b>turrets</b> {{were fully}} {{operational}} as {{were all of}} the Army’s railway guns. Seven of these weapons, six 28cm K5 pieces and a single [...] K12 gun {{with a range of}} , could only be used against land targets. The remainder, thirteen 28cm and five [...] pieces, plus additional motorised batteries comprising twelve 24cm guns and ten 21cm weapons, could be fired at shipping but were of limited effectiveness due to their slow traverse speed, long loading time and ammunition types.|$|R
5000|$|M113A1 Medium Reconnaissance Vehicle (MRV) - Full {{designation}} Carrier, Fire Support, Full Track M113A1 (FS) Scorpion Turret was an Australian variant {{similar to}} the M113 FSV, but using the turret from the FV101 Scorpion light tank, instead of the older turret of the Saladin armoured car, that the FSV had previously used. This turret was equipped with an Image Intensifier sight for the main armament. This II sight was the first effective passive night sight fitted to an Australian AFV, giving the MRVs a night fighting capability exceeding the Leopard AS1 and all other Australian AFVs of the period. Whilst fully amphibious, the MRV was also fitted with a light sheet metal foam filled trim vane and side pods. These pods and the trim vane were intended to provide additional flotation and stability on the water, they provided virtually no additional armour protection. Other changes include a modified driver's hatch which pivoted toward the centre line of the vehicle instead of opening {{to the rear of}} the driver's hatch, this feature preventing the open driver's hatch being caught on the <b>traversing</b> <b>turret,</b> as well as the fitting of the British [...] "boiling vessel" [...] an electric vessel for boiling water and heating rations. As indicated by the designation change, the MRVs were roled as reconnaissance vehicles and issued to the Cavalry (medium reconnaissance) regiments, whereas the FSVs were originally issued to APC squadrons and used to provide infantry fire support.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} armament, the main weapons were twin machine guns, {{one in the}} turret, {{and one in the}} hull. Later, the primary weapon was a hull-mounted, {{manually}} aimed 13 mm Type 92 heavy machine gun, license-built from Hotchkiss. The weapon had limited traverse, but included a pivoting eyepiece on the gunsight optics and a high-angle mount, allowing anti-aircraft use. Secondary armament was a 6.5 mm Type 91 machine gun, replaced later by the 7.7 mm Type 97 light machine gun mounted in the manually <b>traversed</b> <b>turret.</b> Initially, the early models were armed with identical 6.5 mm machine guns on both the turret and the hull.|$|R
5000|$|The M10 tank {{destroyer}} used an M4A2 medium tank chassis (M10A1s used an M4A3 chassis) with an open-topped manually <b>traversed</b> <b>turret</b> mounting the 3-inch Gun M7, in the M5 mount. The M7 gun weighed 1,990 pounds. The gunner stood or sat on {{the left}} side of the gun, and aimed it using the M51 or M70G telescope. An M12A4 panoramic telescope was also provided on the right side of the turret for indirect fire use. The M10 carried 54 rounds of 3-inch ammunition, 48 of which were stowed In four racks in the sponsons, and 6 rounds in the upper rear of the turret. For combat use, the 3-inch Gun M7 could fire five types of ammunition: ...|$|R
2500|$|Most {{versions}} of the T1 series of light tanks shared the same basic layout, with the engine mounted {{in the front and}} the turret, transmission and final drive all located in the rear. The exceptions were the T1E4 and T1E6, which moved the turret to the middle, the engine to the rear, and the transmission and final drive to the front, a configuration similar to later tanks. All T1 versions had a manually <b>traversed</b> <b>turret</b> armed with a 37 mm (...) main gun and a coaxially mounted [...]30 caliber (7.62mm) M1919 Browning machine gun, and all carried a crew of two: a commander who sat within the turret and worked the guns, and a driver seated {{just in front of the}} turret.|$|R
50|$|The turret also {{cannot be}} traversed with the driver's hatch open. Although the tank {{commander}} may override the gunner and <b>traverse</b> the <b>turret,</b> he cannot fire the main gun from his position. He is also unable {{to override the}} gunner in the elevation of the main gun, causing target acquisition problems.|$|R

50|$|To counter these tactics, Soviet sub-machine gunners {{rode the}} tanks and sprayed every doorway and window, but this meant the tank could not <b>traverse</b> its <b>turret</b> quickly.

50|$|With Germanys {{occupation}} of the Pas-de-Calais region in Northern France, the possibility of closing the Strait of Dover to Royal Navy warships and merchant convoys {{by the use of}} land-based heavy artillery became readily apparent, both to the German High Command and to Hitler. Even the Kriegsmarines Naval Operations Office deemed this a plausible and desirable goal, especially given the relatively short distance, 34 km, between the French and English coasts. Orders were therefore issued to assemble and begin emplacing every Army and Navy heavy artillery piece available along the French coast, primarily at Pas-de-Calais. This work was assigned to the Organisation Todt and commenced on 22 July 1940.By early August, four 28 cm <b>traversing</b> <b>turrets</b> were fully operational as were all of the Army’s railway guns. Seven of these weapons, six 28 cm K5 pieces and a single 21 cm K12 gun with a range of 115 km, could only be used against land targets.
