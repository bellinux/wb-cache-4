25|$|Bass once {{described}} his main goal for his title sequences as being to ‘’try {{to reach for}} a simple, visual phrase that <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> the picture is all about and evokes {{the essence of the}} story”. Another philosophy that Bass described as influencing his title sequences was the goal of getting the audience to see familiar parts of their world in an unfamiliar way. Examples of this or what he described as “making the ordinary extraordinary” can be seen in Walk on the Wild Side (1962) where an ordinary cat becomes a mysterious prowling predator, and in Nine Hours to Rama (1963) where the interior workings of a clock become an expansive new landscape. In the 1950s, Saul Bass used a variety of techniques, from cut-out animation for Anatomy of a Murder (1958), to fully animated mini-movies such as the epilogue for Around the World in 80 Days (1956), and live-action sequences.|$|E
500|$|Deus Ex {{received}} critical acclaim, attaining a {{score of}} 90 out of 100 from 28 critics on Metacritic. Thierry Nguyen from Computer Gaming World said that the game [...] "delivers moments of brilliance, idiocy, ingenuity, and frustration." [...] Computer Games Magazine praised the title for its deep gameplay and its use of multiple solutions to situations in the game. Similarly, Edge highlighted the game's freedom of choice, saying that Deus Ex [...] "never <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> to do. Goals are set, but alter according to your decisions." ...|$|E
500|$|Complaints {{about her}} role as fashion {{eminence}} grise are dismissed by those familiar with how she actually exercises it. [...] "She's honest. She <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> she thinks. Yes is yes and no is no," [...] according to Karl Lagerfeld. [...] "She's not too pushy", agrees François-Henri Pinault, {{chief executive officer of}} PPR, Gucci's parent company. [...] "She lets you know it's not a problem if you can't do something she wants." [...] Defenders also point out she continued supporting Gucci despite her strong belief PPR should not have let Tom Ford go. Designers such as Alice Roi and Isabel Toledo have flourished without indulging Wintour or Vogue. Her willingness to throw her weight around has helped keep Vogue independent despite its heavy reliance on advertising dollars. Wintour was the only fashion editor who refused to follow an Armani ultimatum to feature more of its clothes in the magazine's editorial pages, although she has also admitted if she has to choose between two dresses, one by an advertiser and the other not, she will choose the former every time. [...] "Commercial is not a dirty word to me." ...|$|E

500|$|The game {{is noted}} for its simple combat system that would [...] "disappoint those craving sheer {{mechanical}} depth", as stated by GameSpots Miguel Lopez. [...] The game's puzzle design has been praised for creating a rewarding experience for players who work through challenges on their own; Kristen Reed of Eurogamer, for example, said that [...] "you quietly, logically, willingly proceed, and the illusion is perfect: the game never <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> to do, even though the game is always telling you what to do". [...] Ico is also considered a short game, taking between seven and ten hours for a single play through, which Game Revolution calls [...] "painfully short" [...] with [...] "no replay outside of self-imposed challenges". G4TV's Matthew Keil, however, felt that [...] "the game is so strong, many will finish 'Ico' {{in one or two}} sittings". [...] The lack of features in the North American release, which would become unlocked on subsequent playthroughs after completing the game, was said to reduce the replay value of the title. Electronic Gaming Monthly notes that [...] "Yorda would probably be the worst companion -she's scatterbrained and helpless; if not {{for the fact that the}} player develops a bond with her, making the game's ending all the more heartrending." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{technique}} {{attributed to}} Sigmund Freud {{to help in}} making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings. He explained: [...] "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin <b>tells</b> <b>you.</b> <b>What</b> I {{want you to do}} is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how you really feel about the matter, deep down inside. With that as a basis, you'll then be ready to make up your mind and come to the right decision." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the biggest}} reasons {{for the success of}} his company is the {{extraordinary}} efforts taken to involve the public throughout many stages of a bridge’s development. [...] “One of the important activities to us is dealing with the public and designing bridges that the public wants,” said Figg. [...] “We’re convinced that the bridge <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> the public thinks of itself.” (Zehyer 2002) [...] Often considered an advocate for public involvement in bridge design, Figg conducted public meetings during both the design and construction stages of major bridge projects. [...] During these meetings, Figg worked with the communities to help them arrive at decisions about the appearance of the bridge, while ensuring they stay within budget (ASCE 2002). [...] These ideals which were passed down to his daughter, Linda, should serve as lessons for anyone entering the engineering field.|$|E

'SUCH [that is, such ordinances as in themselves are of an indifferent nature] were all the injunctions and prohibitions of the ceremonial law; and some few such we have under the gospel' (p. 7). Then, in p. 9 he <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> these positive precepts under the gospel, or things indifferent, are: 'THAT of going to God by Christ, is one; and the other two, are the institutions of baptism, and the Lord's supper.'

6000|$|Soon {{after the}} return of Colonel Hannay to Calcutta, this miserable Nabob {{received}} intelligence, which concurrent public fame supported, that Mr. Hastings meant to send him up into the country again, on a second expedition, probably with some such order as this:--"You have sucked blood enough for yourself, now try {{what you can do}} for your neighbors." [...] The Nabob was not likely to be misinformed. His friend and agent, Gobind Ram, was at Calcutta, and had constant access to all Mr. Hastings's people. Mr. Hastings himself <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> instructions these vakeels always have to search into and discover all his transactions. This Gobind Ram, alarmed with strong apprehensions, and struck with horror at the very idea of such an event, apprised his master of his belief that Mr. Hastings meant to send Colonel Hannay again into the country. Judge now, my lords, what Colonel Hannay must have been, from the declaration which I will now read to you, extorted from that miserable slave, the Nabob, who thus addresses Mr. Hastings.|$|E
60|$|He would, I think, be a sorry {{creature}} {{who did not}} find something to admire in Campbell Fraser. Metaphysics may not trouble you, as it troubles him, {{but you do not}} sit under the man without seeing his transparent honesty and feeling that he is genuine. In appearance and in habit of thought he is an ideal philosopher, and his communings with himself have lifted him to a level of serenity that is worth struggling for. Of all the arts professors in Edinburgh, he is probably the most difficult to understand, and students in a hurry have called his lectures childish. If so, it may be all the better for them.

60|$|The blame {{of their}} city evils is not {{altogether}} with the gentlemen, chiefly of foreign extraction, {{who control the}} city. These find a people made to their hand--a lawless breed ready to wink at one evasion of the law if they themselves may profit by another, and in their rare leisure hours content to smile over {{the details of a}} clever fraud. Then, says the cultured American, 'Give us time. Give us time, and we shall arrive.' The otherwise American, who is aggressive, straightway proceeds to thrust a piece of half-hanged municipal botch-work under the nose of the alien as a sample of perfected effort. There is nothing more delightful than to sit for a strictly limited time with a child who <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> he means to do when he is a man; but when that same child, loud-voiced, insistent, unblushingly eager for praise, but thin-skinned as the most morbid of hobbledehoys, stands about all your ways telling you the same story in the same voice, you begin to yearn for something made and finished--say Egypt and a completely dead mummy. It is neither seemly nor safe to hint that the government of the largest city in the States is a despotism of the alien by the alien for the alien, tempered with occasional insurrections of the decent folk. Only the Chinaman washes the dirty linen of other lands.|$|E
6000|$|There are {{at least}} two ways in which Browning's work differs from that of other dramatists. When a trained playwright {{produces}} a drama his rule is, [...] "Action, more action, and still more action." [...] Moreover, he stands aside in order to permit his characters to reveal their quality by their own speech or action. For example, Shakespeare's plays are filled with movement, and he never <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> he thinks of Portia or Rosalind or Macbeth, or what ought to become of them. He does not need to tell. But Browning often halts his story to inform you how this or that situation should be met, or what must come out of it. His theory {{is that it is not}} action but thought which determines human character; for a man may be doing what appears to be a brave or generous deed, yet be craven or selfish at heart; or he may be engaged in some apparently sinful proceeding in obedience to a motive that we would acclaim as noble if the whole truth were known [...] "It is the soul and its thoughts that make the man," [...] says Browning, [...] "little else is worthy of study." [...] So he calls most of his works soul studies. If we label them now dramas, or dramatic monologues, or dramatic lyrics (the three classifications of his works), we are to remember that Browning is the one dramatist who deals with thoughts or motives rather than with action.|$|E
60|$|And Jacob {{called all}} his sons together, And said, Ye sons of Jacob come you hither: And hearken what your aged father says, Who <b>tells</b> <b>you</b> <b>what</b> shall {{be in the}} last days. Reuben my first born, of my {{strength}} the flow'rs, The excellency of dignity and power: Unstable as water, be for ever vile, Because thou did thy father's bed defile. Simeon and Levi 're brethren. Instruments Of cruelty lodged in their tents. Come not, my soul, their secret councils nigh, My honour, with them have no unity: For in their wrath they caused a man to fall, And in their self-will digged down a wall. Curs'd be their anger, fierce, yea cursed be Their wrath, for {{it was full of}} cruelty. In Jacob therefore let their seed be spread, And every where in Israel scattered. Judah shall have his brethren's praise, and they Shall bow before him; he his foes shall slay. Judah's a lion's whelp return'd from prey, He stoop'd, he couch'd, and as a lion lay; As an old lion, who shall dare molest, Or rouse him up, when he lies down to rest. The sceptre shall from Judah never start, Nor a lawgiver from his feet depart; Until the blessed Shiloh come, to whom The scatter'd people shall from all parts come: Binding his foal unto the choicest vine, He wash'd his garments, all of them in wine: His eyes shall with the blood of th' grapes look red, And milky whiteness shall his teeth o'erspread. Lo! Zabulon shall dwell upon the sea, And heaven for the ship's security, And unto Zidon shall his border be. And Issachar is a strong ass between Two burdens crouching, who when he had seen That rest was pleasant, and the land was good, His servile neck unto the yoke he bow'd. Dan as a judge shall over Isra'l sway, He shall be as a serpent in the way, To bite the horse, and cast the rider down. O God! I have look'd for thy salvation. Gad by a troop shall be o'ercome, but he Shall at the last obtain the victory. The bread of Ashur shall be fat indeed, And royal dainties shall from his proceed. Like to a hind let loose is Naphtali, He speaketh all his words acceptably. Joseph's a fruitful bough, whose branches tall Grow by a well, and over-top the wall: By reason of hatred which the archers bore, They shot at him and griev'd him very sore, But Joseph's bow in its full strength abode And by the arm of Jacob's mighty God, He was indu'd with strength, from whence alone Is Isra'l's shepherd, and chief corner-stone: Ev'n by my father's God, who shall assist Thee, by th' Almighty God shalt thou be blest, With blessings from above, and from below, With blessings of the breast, and womb also. Thy father's blessings have prevail'd beyond My ancestors. Unto the utmost bound Of the perpetual hills, yea let them rest On Joseph's head, and let him be possest Of all, who was divided from the rest. Young Benjamin shall wolf-like take his prey, And part by night what he hath took by day. All these are the ten tribes of Israel, And thus their father did their fate foretell: And blessed every one of them apart, According to their personal desert. Moreover he gave them a charge and said, Lo! I shall die, but let my bones be laid Among my ancestors in Canaan, where Of Ephron, Abraham bought a sepulchre, Together with a field, to be a place Of burial, for him and all his race. (There Abraham and Sarah lie, and there They Isaac and Rebecca did inter, And there when Leah died I buried her.) The field was purchas'd of the sons of Heth. Thus having said, resigning up his breath To him that gave 't, his feet into the bed He drew, and so was number'd to the dead.|$|E
