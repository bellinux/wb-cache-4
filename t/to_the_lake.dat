5|$|The lake effect snowfalls {{are more}} likely to occur in late fall, early winter, and during spring due to the higher {{temperature}} differences between the lake and the air above it. During summer, the temperature differences can cause thunderstorms to form over the lake and drift eastward along the northern Wasatch Front. Some rainstorms may also be partially attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> effect in fall and spring. It is estimated that approximately six to eight lake effect snowstorms occur in a year, and that 10% of the average precipitation of Salt Lake City can be attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> effect.|$|E
5|$|To {{supplement}} {{water supply}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> even {{as early as}} in 1993, the government built 12 deep tube wells to supplement water supply <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake.</b> However, most tube wells were dysfunctional, thereby aggravating the problem. The Union Ministry for Environment and Forests included Pushkar Lake {{on a list of}} five lakes under the National Lake Conservation Project (NLCP) for restoration. They have been providing funds since 2008 for the restoration works, but the situation has not eased.|$|E

5|$|Abolition {{continued}} to be associated in the public consciousness with the French Revolution and with British radical groups, resulting in a decline in public support.

Conditions vary based on proximity <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> with fog more common in the south and areas close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> noticeably cooler on hot summer days.|$|E

5|$|Across {{the county}} line, NY18 becomes the Roosevelt Highway.

While NY63 ends here, Lyndonville Road continues north <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> as County Route63-1 (CR63-1). This portion of Lyndonville Road was once part of NY63. In Carlton, NY18 intersects the northern terminus of NY279, the last in a series of northsouth routes that terminate at NY18. Not far to the east, the route serves Lakeside Beach State Park and indirectly connects to the western terminus of the Lake Ontario State Parkway. At this point, the Seaway Trail leaves NY18 to follow the parkway along the lakeshore.|$|E
