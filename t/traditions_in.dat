5|$|Scholars have {{suggested}} that oral <b>traditions</b> <b>in</b> general and poetry in particular was well placed to {{play a part in}} cultural resistance to apartheid. Music and poetry were more accessible to a large number of South Africans than written material (partly due to the restrictions placed by apartheid). Music, poetry, and storytelling also formed part of the everyday life of a number of South Africans, and protest songs emerged from these <b>traditions.</b> <b>In</b> addition, poetry was traditionally seen by some South Africans as a legitimate means of criticising authority, with poetic licence allowing artists to say things that would otherwise not be acceptable.|$|E

5|$|Along these lines, some {{academics}} {{link the}} Gawain pentangle to magical <b>traditions.</b> <b>In</b> Germany, the symbol {{was called a}} Drudenfuß and was placed on household objects to keep out evil. The symbol was also associated with magical charms that, if recited or written on a weapon, would call forth magical forces. However, concrete evidence tying the magical pentagram to Gawain's pentangle is scarce.|$|E
5|$|Being a key {{animal in}} the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find {{representation}} in much modern language and symbology. As livestock, sheep are most often associated with pastoral, Arcadian imagery. Sheep figure in many mythologies—such as the Golden Fleece—and major religions, especially the Abrahamic <b>traditions.</b> <b>In</b> both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as sacrificial animals.|$|E
5|$|Derived {{mainly from}} heraldic <b>traditions</b> <b>in</b> France and the United Kingdom, Canadian {{heraldry}} also incorporates distinctly Canadian symbols, especially native flora and fauna, {{references to the}} First Nations and other aboriginal peoples of Canada, and uniquely Canadian elements such as the Canadian pale, derived from the Canadian flag. A unique system of cadency is used for daughters inheriting arms, and a special symbol for United Empire Loyalists.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{relevant}} words are of slightly uncertain meaning, it seems fairly clear that Völundr {{is described as}} one of the elves in Völundarkviða. As his most prominent deed in the poem is to rape Böðvildr, the poem associates elves with being a sexual threat to maidens. The same idea is present in two post-classical Eddaic poems, which are also influenced by chivalric romance or Breton lais, Kötludraumur and Gullkársljóð. The idea also occurs in later <b>traditions</b> <b>in</b> Scandinavia and beyond, so may be an early attestation of a prominent tradition. Elves also appear in a couple of verse spells, including the Bergen rune-charm from among the Bryggen inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|Ganesha likely {{emerged as}} a deity {{as early as the}} 2nd century AD, but most {{certainly}} by the 4th and 5th centuries AD, during the Gupta period, although he inherited traits from Vedic and pre-Vedic precursors. Hindu mythology identifies him as the restored son of Parvati and Shiva of the Shaivism tradition, but he is a pan-Hindu god found in its various <b>traditions.</b> <b>In</b> the Ganapatya tradition of Hinduism, Ganesha is the supreme deity. The principal texts on Ganesha include the Ganesha Purana, the Mudgala Purana, and the Ganapati Atharvashirsa. Brahma Purana and Brahmanda Purana are other two Puranic genre encyclopedic texts that deal with Ganesha.|$|E
