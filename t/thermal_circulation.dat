50|$|Sandstrom {{asserted}} that <b>thermal</b> <b>circulation</b> can cause vigorous, steady circulation only if heating occurs at greater depths than cooling. This is {{known today as}} Sandström's theorem. Sandstrom's theorem represents an attempt at extending the well known result of classical thermodynamic theory {{that in order for}} a heat engine to perform positive work over a cycle, the work of expansion needs to occur at greater pressure than the work of contraction. Sandstrom's theorem is therefore technically true, as long as expansion in the fluid is caused by heating and contraction by cooling, and that greater depths occur at greater pressures. There is an ambiguity, however, as to the meaning of the terms 'heating' and 'cooling' in Sandstrom's theorem. So far, heating and cooling has always been interpreted in the literature as being associated with 'surface heating' and 'surface cooling' respectively. In real fluids, however, molecular and turbulent diffusion always cause internal heating/cooling even in absence of external heating/cooling, as long as the temperature of the fluid considered is non-uniform. As is well-known, molecular and turbulent diffusion tends to relax the system toward thermodynamic equilibrium, i.e., toward an isothermal state, which for a statically stable fluid, will warm up the fluid at high pressure, and cool it down at low pressure. Therefore, because of internal diabatic heating/cooling by molecular/turbulent diffusion, the overall heating experienced by a stratified fluid always occurs at greater pressure than the total cooling, even if the external cooling/heating occur at the same pressure. As a result, internal diabatic heating/cooling due to molecular diffusion explains why laboratory experiments show evidence of circulations developing as the result of surface heating/cooling (Park and Whitehead, 2000) or even when the heating is above the cooling (Coman et al., 2006). Sandström's key (though not clearly expressed) insight, was that in such circulations, the circulation as a whole must transport light water downwards and dense water upwards. This means that the effect of the circulation is to increase the potential energy. Such an increase requires an external source of energy. Recent work has built on this to argue that the ocean circulation as a whole is driven by these external sources of energy, whether wind or tides, with newer work suggesting that internal sources and sinks of energy (such as those driving diffusion) are also potentially important.|$|E

40|$|High-resolution {{numerical}} model simulations {{have been used}} to study the local and mesoscale <b>thermal</b> <b>circulations</b> in an Alpine lake basin. The lake (87 km(2)) is situated in the Southern Alps, New Zealand and is located in a glacially excavated rock basin surrounded by mountain ranges that reach 3000 m in height. The mesoscale model used (RAMS) is a three-dimensional non-hydrostatic model with a level 2. 5 turbulence closure scheme. The model demonstrates that thermal forcing at local (within the basin) and regional (coast-to-basin inflow) scales drive the observed boundary-layer airflow in the lake basin during clear anticyclonic summertime conditions. The results show that the lake can modify (perturb) both the local and regional wind systems. Following sunrise, local <b>thermal</b> <b>circulations</b> dominate, including a lake breeze component that becomes embedded within the background valley wind system. This results in a more divergent flow in the basin extending across the lake shoreline. However, a closed lake breeze circulation is neither observed nor modelled. Modelling results indicate that {{in the latter part of}} the day when the mesoscale (coast-to-basin) inflow occurs, the relatively cold pool of lake air in the basin can cause the intrusion to decouple from the surface.

40|$|The {{wind regime}} of the Lake Tekapo Basin is {{examined}} {{with reference to}} the interaction of multi-scale local, regional and synoptic circulations. Analysis of the historical wind direction record from Mt John identifies airflow from three principal directions to most frequently affect the study area. Both seasonal and diurnal trends in the frequency of each directional category are identified, which reflect the influence of local thermal forcings and seasonal changes in synoptic circulation on the Lake Tekapo windfield. Meteorological observations from a network of automatic weather stations and anemographs within the study area identified Lake Tekapo to generate its own circulation system, a lake/land breeze. This combines with the larger scale valley wind, which during ideal conditions continues after sunset in {{the upper reaches of the}} lake catchment. During light to moderate foehn northwesterly conditions, the combined lake breeze/valley wind system remains decoupled from the prevailing synoptic airstream.

40|$|Using an {{idealized}} tube model and scaling analysis, the physics supporting the oceanic thermohaline circulation is examined. <b>Thermal</b> <b>circulation</b> in the tube {{model can be}} classified into two categories. When the cooling source is at a level {{higher than that of}} the heating source, the <b>thermal</b> <b>circulation</b> is friction-controlled; thus, mixing is not important in determining the circulation rate. When the cooling source is at a level lower than that of the heating source, the circulation is mixing controlled; thus, weak (strong) mixing will lead to weak (strong) <b>thermal</b> <b>circulation.</b> Within realistic parameter regimes the thermohaline circulation requires external sources of mechanical energy to support mixing {{in order to maintain the}} basic stratification. Thus, the oceanic circulation is only a heat conveyor belt, not a heat engine. Simple scaling shows that the meridional mass and heat fluxes are linearly proportional to the energy supplied to mixing. The rate of tidal dissipation in the open oceans (excluding the shallow marginal seas) is about 0. 9 – 1. 3 (31012 W); the rate of potential energy generated by geothermal heating is estimated to be 0. 5 3 1012 W. Accordingly, the global-mean rate of mixing inferred from oceanic climatological data is about 0. 22 3 1024 m 2 s 21. Using a primitive equation model, numerical experiments based on a fixed energy source for mixing have been carried out in order to test the scaling law. In comparison with models under fixed rate of mixing, a model under a fixed energy for mixing is less sensitive to changes in the forcing conditions due to climatic changes. Under a surface relaxation condition for temperature and standard parameters, the model is well within the region of Hopf bifurcation, so decadal variability is expected. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{review of}} non-local, deep {{transport}} mechanisms {{in the atmosphere}} of Earth provides a good foundation for examining whether similar mechanisms are operating in the atmospheres of Mars and Titan. On Earth, deep convective clouds in the tropics constitute the upward branch of the Hadley Cell and provide a conduit through which energy, moisture, momentum, aerosols and chemical species are moved from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. This transport produces mid-tropospheric minima in quantities such as water vapor and moist static energy and maxima where the clouds detrain. Analogs to this terrestrial transport {{are found in the}} strong and deep <b>thermal</b> <b>circulations</b> associated with topography on Mars and with Mars dust storms. Observations of elevated dust layers on Mars further support the notion that non-local deep transport is an important mechanism in the atmosphere of Mars. On Titan, the presence of deep convective clouds almost assures that non-local, deep transport is occurring and these clouds {{may play a role in}} global cycling of energy, momentum, and methane. Based on the potential importance of non-local deep transport in Earth’s atmosphere and supported by evidence for such transport in the atmospheres of Mars and Titan, greater attention to this mechanism in extraterrestrial atmospheres is warranted. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. During {{the last}} two decades, several land surface schemes for use in climate, {{regional}} and/or mesoscale, hydrological and ecological models have been designed. For all of them, of great importance is a correct parameterization of the energy and momentum transport from the surface. Mainly, the land-surface schemes have been developed in order to parameterize land-surface variations both on daily and annual time scales. In this paper we describe the Land Air Parameterization Surface Scheme (LAPS) designed for use in atmospheric models and mainly for use in simulations of <b>thermal</b> <b>circulations.</b> It has two modules for parameterizing the processes at the boundary-layer interface: one for a bare surface and one for a vegetated one. Incorrect parameterization of land-surface processes and prescription of the surface parameters in atmospheric modeling, can result in artificial changes of horizontal gradient of the sensible heat flux. Thus, an error in horizontal temperature gradient within the lower atmosphere may be introduced. Of course, {{the reliability of the}} model depends on the quality of boundary-layer scheme implemented and its sensitivity to the bare soil and vegetation parameters. In this study, the sensitivity of the LAPS scheme to parameterization of bare soil processes, ground roughness length, vegetation parameters (stomatal resistance, leaf area index and canopy height) and albedo, has been examined.

40|$|A radiative-dynamic {{positive}} feedback mechanism (Wind Enhanced Interaction of Radiation and Dust: WEIRD) for localized Mars dust disturbances was previously found {{to operate in}} highly idealized numerical experiments. Numerical simulations are used to test for the presence and quantitative effect of the radiative-dynamic WEIRD feedback mechanism under more realistic conditions. Comparisons between cases where lifted dust is radiatively active and radiatively passive elucidate {{the importance of the}} dust radiative forcing on the thermodynamic and kinematic structure of the atmosphere. The WEIRD feedback mechanism does operate under realistic conditions, although it can be masked and diminished by a variety of other forcing mechanisms. Globally increased dust loading is found to accelerate the local winds while simultaneously diminishing the impact of local physiographical forcing. Local enhancements of dust produce a thermal and dynamical response that resembles many of the essential features seen in the idealized experiments. The development of a warm core low, rotational wind tendencies and convergence boundaries intersecting {{at the center of the}} strongest dust storms are consistent with WEIRD. Local and regional storms are effective at producing elevated dust layers above the boundary layer aided by the radiative forcing of the dust. Ubiquitous and persistent <b>thermal</b> <b>circulations</b> associated with topography can also inject dust into the free atmosphere above the planetary boundary layer, but they are less efficient than the dust storms.

The energy terms K&psi;, K&chi; and APE and the conversion terms f&nabla;&psi;. &# 8711;&chi;, &minus;&omega;'T' are calculated at 850 hPa level and also vertically integrated from 1000 hPa to 100 hPa. The results indicate that, the year of high energy (both K&Psi;, K&chi;) i. e. 2002, does not give a good amount of rainfall compared to the good year i. e. 2003. The break period during the year 2002 has been clearly explained using the block diagrams. Periods of highest rainfall coincide with the positive conversions of f&nabla;&psi;. &nabla;&chi; and &minus;&omega;'T'. Vertically integrated moisture fluxes during the break period of 2002, 2003 are also analyzed. The main reservoirs (sources and sinks) for the monsoon energy are also identified using block diagrams. Negative correlation between daily rainfall and energy terms in the year 2002 indicates its unusual behavior both in terms of energetics as well as precipitation. Positive correlations in the year 2003 represent strong monsoonal behavior. We calculated the climatology of the total kinetic energy at 850 hPa, vertically integrated (1000 – 100 hPa) for 30 years (1980 – 2009) and rainfall for 103 years (1901 – 2003) which clearly indicates that the monsoon is indeed a season of high energy for the South Asian region.

The emphasis was on morning and evening transitions, but measurements cover the entire day; therefore a brief analysis is performed to represent the general <b>thermal</b> <b>circulation</b> pattern. Both transition periods are characterised by complex dynamic behaviours. During evening transition, the upslope flow has got through a stagnation condition characterised by wind velocity U< 0 : 5 m=s. Only when the stagnating air has become negative buoyant, the flow is allowed to pour downslope like a slab. Some features of front formation has been found during the transition development, such as delay time of downslope flow start up along the slope, {{and the presence of}} positive turbulent kinetic energy {{at the onset of the}} motion. Eventually the observed evening transition has followed a mixed mechanisms, with features from different models. Therefore the Rayleigh number seems not to be a good criterion by which parametrise evening transition itself. Morning transition is characterised by destruction of nocturnal temperature inversion and the onset of upslope flow. Inversion destruction can be described in terms of CBL growth at surface and inversion decent from the top of the layer. KH has found to be a good indicator of inversion breakup, if used as parameter to study the inversion breakup in terms of temperature reversal. After the inversion breakup, buoyancy and mechanical productions supply the flow with the necessary energy to start the upslope wind. More quantitative analysis are provided by the study of stability parameters and turbulent kinetic energy budgets. Gradient Richardson number has been used in this terms, finding that a mixed SBL-CBL behaviour dominates the most of the observed layers.

The present study focuses {{on the last day of}} the intensive observation period 2 (26 June 2001), which is characterized by a weak synoptic pressure gradient favouring the development of <b>thermal</b> <b>circulations.</b> Under such conditions, a complex stratification of the atmosphere is observed. Three-dimensional numerical simulations, with the Méso-NH atmospheric model including the town energy balance (TEB) urban parameterization, are conducted over south-eastern France. A complete evaluation of the model outputs was already performed at both regional and city scales. Here, the 250 -m resolution outputs describing the vertical structure of the atmosphere above the Marseille area are compared to the Doppler lidar data, for which the spatial resolution is comparable. This joint analysis underscores the consistency between the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) observed by the Doppler lidar and that modelled by Méso-NH. The observations and simulations reveal the presence of a shallow sea breeze (SSB) superimposed on a deep sea breeze (DSB) above Marseille during daytime. Because of the step-like shape of the Marseille coastline, the SSB is organized in two branches of different directions, which converge above the city centre. The analysis of the 250 -m wind fields shows evidence of the role of the local topography on the local dynamics. Indeed, the topography tends to reinforce the SSB while it weakens the DSB.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of shading by shallow cumulus (shallow Cu) and the {{subsequent}} effect of inducing heterogeneous conditions at the surface on boundary-layer characteristics. We placed special emphasis on quantifying {{the changes in the}} characteristic length and time scales associated with thermals, shallow Cu and induced <b>thermal</b> <b>circulation</b> structures. A series of systematic numerical experiments, inspired by Amazonian thermodynamic conditions, was performed using a large-eddy simulation model coupled to a land-surface model. We used four different experiments to disentangle {{the effects of}} shallow Cu on the surface and the response of clouds to these surface changes. The experiments include a ‘clear case’, ‘transparent clouds’, ‘shading clouds’ and a case with a prescribed uniform domain and reduced surface heat flux. We also performed a sensitivity study on the effect of introducing a weak background flow. Length and time scales were calculated using autocorrelation and two-dimensional spectral analysis, and we found that shading controlled by shallow Cu locally lowers surface temperatures and consequently reduces the sensible and latent heat fluxes, thus inducing spatial and temporal variability in these fluxes. The length scale of this surface heterogeneity is not sufficiently large to generate circulations that are superimposed on the boundary-layer scale, but the heterogeneity does disturb boundary-layer dynamics and generates a flow opposite to the normal <b>thermal</b> <b>circulation.</b> Besides this effect, shallow Cu shading reduces turbulent kinetic energy and lowers the convective velocity scale, thus reducing the mass flux. This hampers the thermal lifetime, resulting in a decrease in the shallow Cu residence time (from 11 to 7 min). This reduction in lifetime, combined with a decrease in mass flux, leads to smaller clouds. This is partially compensated for by a decrease in thermal cell size due to a reduction in turbulent kinetic energy. As a result, inter-cloud distance is reduced, leading to a larger population of smaller clouds, while maintaining cloud cover similar to the non-shading clouds experiment. Introducing a 1 ms - 1 background wind speed increases the thermal size in the sub-cloud layer, but the diagnosed surface–cloud coupling, quantified by characteristic time and length scales, remain...|$|E
40|$|The {{study area}} extends along the {{southern}} boundary of the central-eastern pre-Alps. The research is mainly focused in the analyses of the thermal districts of the Verona Province. A geological, geophysical and geochemical research is being performed in the area characterized by different temperatures and hydrogeological conditions in the thermal districts. The aim of study consists on the characterization of the thermal reservoirs in relations with the uses of the resource. For these purposes two groundwater sampling campaign have been conducted in the autumn 2014 and summer-autumn 2015, with the support by C. N. R. IGG of Pisa. The geophysical surveys also helped to provide useful information for better understanding of certain analyzed areas. Furthermore geochemical and isotope analysis have provided fundamental information regarding the hydro- <b>thermal</b> <b>circulation,</b> in the studied geothermal districts. The data of this research {{can be used as}} input parameters in geothermal modeling to draw a geothermal map of the research area. This research will provide many information about thermal resources aimed at promoting the rational use of geothermal energy. Third-year activit...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring {{the glacier}} mass balance of summer-accumulation-type Himalayan glaciers is {{critical}} to not only {{assess the impact of}} climate change on the volume of such glaciers but also predict the downstream water availability and the global sea-level change in future. To better understand the change in meteorological parameters related to glacier mass balance and runoff in a glacierized basin and to assess the highly heterogeneous glacier responses to climate change in the Nepal Himalaya and nearby ranges, the Cryosphere Monitoring Project (CMP) carries out meteorological observations in Langtang Valley and mass-balance measurements on Yala Glacier, a debris-free glacier in the same valley. A negative annual mass balance of - 0. 89 mw. e. and the rising equilibrium-line altitude of Yala Glacier indicate a continuation of a secular trend toward more negative mass balances. Lower temperature lapse rate during the monsoon, the effect of convective precipitation associated with mesoscale <b>thermal</b> <b>circulation</b> in the local precipitation and the occurrence of distinct diurnal cycles of temperature and precipitation at different stations in the valley are other conclusions of this comprehensive scientific study initiated by CMP which aims to yield multi-year glaciological, hydrological and meteorological observations in the glacierized Langtang River basin...|$|E
40|$|In the near-weightless {{environment}} of orbiting spacecraft capillary forces dominate interfacial flow phenomena over unearthly large length scales. In current experiments aboard the International Space Station, partially open channels are being investigated to determine critical flow rate-limiting conditions above which the free surface collapses ingesting bubbles. Without the natural passive phase separating qualities of buoyancy, such ingested bubbles can in turn {{wreak havoc on}} the fluid transport systems of spacecraft. The flow channels under investigation represent geometric families of conduits with applications to liquid propellant acquisition, <b>thermal</b> fluids <b>circulation,</b> and water processing for life support. Present and near future experiments focus on transient phenomena and conduit asymmetries allowing capillary forces to replace the role of gravity to perform passive phase separations. Terrestrial applications are noted where enhanced transport via direct liquid-gas contact is desired...|$|R
40|$|The {{size and}} rated {{capacity}} of commercial wind turbines have grown steadily {{since the early}} 1990 s. Typical turbines in the 1990 s were rated below 1 MW, with rotor diameters of around 30 – 50 m and hub heights 40 – 60 m. Recent technological advances in wind turbine design have increased the generation capacity above 1 MW and raised the hub height of the machines used in new wind farm projects to around 80 m above ground level. The trend of larger turbines will continue; some turbines currently under development for deployment {{during the second half}} of this decade are rated at 2 – 5 MW of energy generation with rotor diameters near 100 m and hub heights of 100 – 120 m. These advanced turbines will take advantage of the higher wind speeds aloft to generate more wind energy. Specific knowledge of important wind characteristics at turbine hub height is still needed to optimize turbine design and wind farm layout. Physical measurements of parameters such as wind speed, wind power density, and wind speed shear at heights of 80 – 120 m were virtually nonexistent a few years ago and are still rare today. Most wind energy anemometer measurements are at heights of 50 m or lower. A common practice in the wind energy industry is to analyze data from the shorter towers and extrapolate these data to turbine hub heights for wind farm design and wind energy prediction. This technique is much less reliable for hub heights of 80 m and higher. The decreasing influence of surface roughness on wind shear and increasing influence of lower atmospheric features such as low-level jets and <b>thermal</b> <b>circulations</b> makes simple extrapolation prone to large errors. Recently updated state wind resource maps (Schwartz and Elliott 2004) are used for regional wind farm siting. However, the maps are only validated for 50 m above the ground and the resource patterns depicted on the maps may not accurately reflect the distribution of the resource for levels 80 m and higher...|$|R

The article is copyrighted by the Royal Meteorological Society {{and published by}} John Wiley & Sons, Inc. It can be found at: [URL] field campaign, the Slope Experiment near La Fouly (SELF- 2010), was conducted to monitor the evening transition of slope flows on clear-sky days from July to September 2010 in a narrow valley of the Swiss Alps. A steep west-facing slope with inclinations ranging from 25 ° to 45 ° was instrumented from 1900 m to 2200 m above sea-level. Detailed measurements were made along a linear transect of the slope with two turbulence towers, two weather stations, five surface temperature measurement stations and a tethered balloon system. The present study focuses on nine exemplary ‘convective’ days, characterized by weak synoptic flow and clear-sky conditions, during which <b>thermal</b> <b>circulations</b> prevail. The analysis of the observational data shows that topographic shading triggers the evening transition. The topographic configuration around the experimental site results in a sharply defined ‘shading front’ propagating upslope, causing a sudden decrease in incoming short-wave radiation {{on the order of}} several hundreds of W m⁻² within a few minutes. The slope surface rapidly responds to the advancing shading front; in some cases, reductions in surface temperatures of some 10 °C in less than 10 min are observed. This is rapidly followed by an early-evening calm period with very small turbulent kinetic energy (TKE< 0. 05 m² s⁻²) and extremely light wind speeds (< 0. 5 m s⁻¹). When the inertia-driven upslope flow is fully stopped by the katabatic acceleration, a shallow local drainage flow forms and reaches a quasi-equilibrium 1. 5 h after the local sunset. An analysis of the TKE budget close to the surface shows that the buoyancy flux is much greater than the shear production in the last hours before the local sunset, possibly due to valley curvature effects...|$|R
