5|$|Ranked wing {{commander}} at {{the outbreak of}} World WarII, Wackett immediately faced major supply challenges {{in his role as}} Director of <b>Technical</b> <b>Services.</b> Spare parts for the RAAF's mainly British-built equipment were now in short supply, a fact complicated by the infancy of the local aircraft industry and a US arms embargo. His directorate made whatever use it could of civilian repair facilities, setting up central recovery depots to salvage spares from damaged aircraft and other equipment. He also drew on the advice and support of his brother Lawrence, who had established the RAAF's <b>technical</b> <b>services</b> organisation in the 1920s and now, having retired from the Air Force, headed the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC). By late 1940, Wackett had been promoted temporary group captain, and joined the Flying Personnel Research Committee. Its members, drawn from the aviation, medical, scientific and technical disciplines, were to study and report upon such factors as aircrew safety, comfort, fatigue, survival, motion sickness, decompression and hypoxia.|$|E

40|$|The {{automotive}} <b>technical</b> <b>servicing</b> system {{includes several}} kinds of <b>technical</b> activities, <b>technical</b> <b>service,</b> current repair and diagnostics. One of essential elements of the car <b>technical</b> <b>service</b> system is mileage in between <b>servicing.</b> During <b>technical</b> <b>servicing</b> oil is replaced, diagnostics and other servicing work planned by the car producers is performed. The automobile producers increase the car mileage in between servicing following marketing trend. If for highly forced engines the mileage in between servicing is technically groundlessly increased, {{it can lead to}} essential decrease of resources of motors and other systems. The aim of research is to determine influence of infrequent servicing of vehicle on vehicle service life. According to the results of the research infrequent <b>technical</b> <b>servicing</b> leads to premature decrease of the automobile’s engine service life...|$|R
5|$|A 1943 {{attempt by}} Somervell {{to abolish the}} <b>Technical</b> <b>Services</b> failed amid the furor and panic created by false rumors {{that he was being}} {{considered}} for the post of chief of staff if Marshall was sent to Europe to command the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force. Somervell sometimes pushed extravagant white elephant projects, such as the Canol Road, which he continued long after the strategic imperative behind it had faded.|$|E
5|$|Berryman's Duntroon {{class had}} not yet {{completed}} its military training. Major General William Throsby Bridges decided that regimental duty would rectify that deficiency, so he assigned the Duntroon cadets as regimental officers of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF), rather than as staff officers. Cadets were given the choice of service in the infantry or light horse. One cadet, Lawrence Wackett, protested that he wished {{to serve in the}} <b>technical</b> <b>services.</b> When asked if they would prefer the <b>technical</b> <b>services,</b> twelve cadets, including Berryman, Beavis, Clowes, Vasey, and Wackett stepped forward. Berryman was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Permanent Military Forces (PMF) on 29 June 1915 and again in the First AIF on 1 July 1915. He was posted to Lieutenant Colonel Harold Grimwade's 4th Field Artillery Brigade of the 2nd Division Artillery, along with Vasey and Milford. Berryman embarked for Egypt with the 4th Field Artillery Brigade on the transport Wiltshire on 17 November 1915. In Egypt, Berryman briefly commanded the 4th Brigade Ammunition Column before it was absorbed into the 2nd Division Ammunition Column.|$|E

40|$|The {{perceived}} {{importance of}} five <b>technical</b> <b>service</b> qualities (Gronroos 1984) or features (i. e. {{national and local}} policies, leaders, values and candidates), and voters’ ratings of the Labour and Conservative Parties’ competence {{on each of these}} parameters, were investigated during the 2001 British General Election using an a priori segmentation method and the classification tree statistical technique for data analysis. Voter ratings of the <b>technical</b> <b>service</b> features were found to be indicators of intention to vote. A product differentiation approach is most likely to influence voting intention, because the <b>technical</b> <b>service</b> features are more readily manipulated through marketing programmes than demographic and customer characteristics (Bucklin and Gupta 1992). Ratings of <b>technical</b> <b>service</b> features are stronger indicators of voting intention than voter demographics and characteristics. A product differentiation approach, based around <b>technical</b> <b>service</b> features, would be the most effective focus for strategy development in future political marketing campaigns...|$|R

5|$|Promoted to {{temporary}} flight lieutenant on 1 August 1943, McAloney {{was sent}} to the Directorate of <b>Technical</b> <b>Services</b> from November as the specialist officer on American and gas turbine jet engines.

He returned to Australia and his position with <b>Technical</b> <b>Services</b> in December, and saw out the remainder of the war in this post. McAloney decided he wanted to remain in the Air Force on the cessation of hostilities, and subsequently sought a permanent commission in the post-war RAAF. Having continued on a short-service commission in the meantime, his application was ultimately approved in September 1948 and he was granted the substantive rank of flight lieutenant. His younger brother, Robert Simpson McAloney, also saw service with the RAAF in the Second World War. He had enlisted in late 1937 and rose to the rank of warrant officer before his discharge in 1946, his final posting being to No.1 Communication Unit.|$|E

He was further tasked with compiling a register of aeroplane equipment at RAAF flight training units and operational bases throughout Australia. The latter entailed McAloney visiting several Air Force units in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland to check equipment stores. On 1 March 1942, he was commissioned as a flying officer.

5|$|In mid-1946, McAloney was {{involved}} in an investigation {{into a series of}} engine failures experienced by RAAF aircraft.

He returned to his duties at the Directorate of <b>Technical</b> <b>Services</b> on the investigation's conclusion. Made squadron leader in March 1950, he attended a land/air warfare course the following year. McAloney was posted to Singapore in June 1952 as the technical officer to the Changi-based No.90 (Composite) Wing, formed specifically for service in the Malayan Emergency.
