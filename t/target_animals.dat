5|$|Shooting {{by trained}} marksmen is {{considered}} to be the most practical method of control due to its effectiveness. The NSW Department of Primary Industries believe shooting is the preferred method of population control as it does not subject the horses to the stresses of mustering, yarding, and long-distance transportation, all of which are related to 'capture and removal' methods. Horses that are only initially wounded from shooting are tracked and dispatched if they are in accessible, open country. However, shooting of horses in mountain ranges is not regarded as a humane means of control. Helicopter shootings allow for aerial reconnaissance of a large area to target the densest populations, and shooters may get close enough to the <b>target</b> <b>animals</b> to ensure termination. This method is considered the most effective and cost efficient means of control, but disapproval is high amongst those that believe it is inhumane. Organizations supporting Brumbies argue that aerial shooting is unnecessary and that alternative population control methods have not been given adequate trials, while government officials express concern about the need to control rapidly growing populations in order to avoid ecological problems associated with too many feral horses in certain areas.|$|E

2500|$|In some areas, dholes are [...] to tigers and leopards. Competition {{between these}} species is mostly avoided through {{differences}} in prey selection, {{although there is}} still substantial dietary overlap. Along with leopards, dholes typically <b>target</b> <b>animals</b> in the 30–175kg range (mean weights of 35.3kg for dhole and 23.4kg for leopard), while tigers selected for prey animals heavier than 176kg (but their mean prey weight was 65.5kg). Also, other characteristics of the prey, such as sex, arboreality, and aggressiveness, {{may play a role}} in prey selection. For example, dholes preferentially select male chital, whereas leopards kill both sexes more evenly (and tigers prefer larger prey altogether), dholes and tigers kill langurs rarely compared to leopards due to the leopards' greater arboreality, while leopards kill wild boar infrequently due to the inability of this relatively light predator to tackle aggressive prey of comparable weight.|$|E

40|$|Across 2 experiments, a new {{experimental}} {{procedure was}} used to investigate attentional capture by animal fear-relevant stimuli. In Experiment 1 (N = 34), unselected participants were slower to detect a neutral <b>target</b> <b>animal</b> {{in the presence of}} a spider than a cockroach distractor and {{in the presence of a}} snake than a large lizard distractor. This result confirms that phylogenetically fear-relevant animals capture attention specifically and to a larger extent than do non-fear-relevant animals. In Experiment 2 (N = 86), detection of a neutral <b>target</b> <b>animal</b> was slowed more in the presence of a feared fear-relevant distractor (e. g., a snake for snake-fearful participants) than in presence of a not-feared fear-relevant distractor (e. g:, a spider for snake-fearful participants). These results indicate preferential attentional capture that is specific to phylogenetically fear-relevant stimuli and is selectively enhanced in individuals who fear these animals...|$|R

The excavated layers show a great dependence on smaller animals such as bats and rats, as the staple source of food, with occasional consumption of larger mammals such as pigs and deers. This parallels the trend in the consumption of Rhysota and Thiara.|$|E
50|$|Trappers can {{employ a}} variety of devices and {{strategies}} to avoid unwanted catches. Ideally, if a non-target animal (such as a domestic cat or dog) is caught in a non-lethal trap, it can be released without harm. A careful choice of set and lure may help to catch <b>target</b> <b>animals</b> while avoiding non-target animals. Although trappers cannot always guarantee that unwanted animals won't be caught, they can take precautions to avoid unwanted catches or release them unharmed.|$|E

50|$|Wildlife {{managers}} commonly try {{to create}} wildlife reserves to conserve habitat for species of concern. The behavior of <b>target</b> <b>animals</b> is pivotal in designing the size, shape, location, and habitat of these reserves. For example, many bird reserves in Central and South America are located in high mountains, but in one instance 25% of the local birds left the protected area to forage. Understanding behaviors including recruitment, settling, spawning, foraging, territoriality, daily movements, and seasonal patterns of migration are all important for conservation success.|$|E
50|$|All of the {{specimens}} in the exhibits, {{with the}} exception of freshwater juvenile salmon, are collected from the nearby Pacific Ocean, specifically from Barkley Sound and Clayoquot Sound, and are seasonally released back into the ocean. This part of Vancouver Island harbors a wide variety of habitats and species because of its varied geography and exposure to the open ocean. Most specimens are collected either by scuba divers, by hand at low tide, or by hand seining beaches, whereby specific <b>target</b> <b>animals</b> are removed from the net and the rest are returned to the water. Other specimens are occasionally donated by local fisher folk who can access deep or offshore habitats.|$|E

50|$|The rocket net or similar-looking item {{is placed}} at the target {{location}} after days or week of pre-baiting the target species in, or is place {{in an area where}} it is likely to capture the <b>target</b> <b>animals,</b> to allow animals to become accustom to its presence. When the biologist is ready to use the actual rocket net, the net is folded accordion style in a line or packed in the rocket net bock. The rear or trailing edge of the net is staked to the ground by ropes and {{the leading edge of the}} net is attached to a number of rockets (typically 3 or 4) via longer ropes. The rockets are placed on the box, staked to the ground, or placed on post for additional elevation when taller animals are trapped. The charges are placed in the rocket and the wires attached to a shunted electrical blasting line. Once all the charges are connected, the line is tested, and the area is safe, it is attached to the capacitor blasting machine. When the animals are in place, the operator activates the blasting machine and the electrical charge ignites the rockets, propelling the net over the animals. The biologists and their team then remove the animals for whatever study they are conducting.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Peroxisome proliferator-activated {{receptor}} (PPAR) -γ is {{a nuclear}} hormone receptor that regulates gene expression, cell proliferation and differentiation. We previously described airway epithelial cell PPARγ deficient mice that develop airspace enlargement with decreased tissue resistance and increased lung volumes. We sought {{to understand the}} impact of airspace enlargement in conditionally targeted mice upon the physio-mechanical properties of the lung. Methods We measured elastic recoil and its determinants, including tissue structure and surface forces. We measured alveolar number using radial alveolar counts, and airspace sizes and their distribution using computer-assisted morphometry. Results Air vs. saline-filled pressure volume profiles demonstrated loss of lung elastic recoil in targeted mice that was contributed by both tissue components and surface tension, but was proportional to lung volume. There {{were no significant differences}} in surfactant quantity/function nor in elastin and collagen content between <b>targeted</b> <b>animals</b> and littermate controls. Importantly, radial alveolar counts were significantly reduced in the <b>targeted</b> <b>animals</b> and at 8 weeks of age there were 18 % fewer alveoli with 32 % more alveolar ducts. Additionally, the alveolar ducts were 19 % larger in the <b>targeted</b> <b>animals.</b> Conclusions Our data suggest that the functional abnormalities, including loss of recoil are secondary to altered force transmission due to differences in the structure of alveolar ducts, rather than changes in surfactant function or elastin or collagen content. These data further define the nature of abnormal lung maturation in the absence of airway epithelial cell PPARγ and identify a putative genetic determinant of dysanapsis, which may serve as a precursor to chronic lung disease. </p...|$|R
