40|$|Heat {{shrink tubing}} {{is used to}} {{insulate}} wire conductors, protect wires, and to create cable entry seals in <b>wire</b> <b>harnessing</b> industries. Performing this sensitive process manually is time consuming, the results are strongly dependent on the operator’s expertise, and the process presents safety concerns. Alternatively, automating the process minimizes the operators’ direct interaction, decreases the production cost over the long term, and improves quantitative and qualitative production indicators dramatically. This thesis introduces the automation of a heat shrink tubing prototype machine that benefits <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> <b>harnessing</b> industry. <b>The</b> prototype consists of an instrumented heat chamber on a linear positioning system, and is fitted with two heat guns. The chamber design allows for the directing of hot air from the heat guns onto <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> <b>harness</b> uniformly through radially-distributed channels. The linear positioning system is designed to move the heat chamber along <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> <b>harness</b> as <b>the</b> proper shrinkage temperature level is reached. Heat exposure time as {{a major factor in}} the heat shrink tubing process can be governed by controlling the linear speed of the heat chamber. A control unit manages the actuator position continuously by measuring the chamber’s speed and temperature. A model-based design approach is followed to design and test the controller, and MATLAB/Simulink is used as the simulation environment. A programmable logic controller is selected as the controller implementation platform. The control unit performance is examined and its responses follow the simulation results with adequate accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Based {{on the use}} of {{dedicated}} software tools, Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) techniques are able to capture and reuse engineering product and process knowledge to reduce time and cost during product development. In this paper a conceptual design of an automatic <b>wire</b> <b>harness</b> routing application is proposed, based on KBE.

Through comparison with related methods and existing algorithms, a suitable algorithm, named A* is selected. In order to comply with the complex aircraft specific routing environments, the selected algorithm is enhanced with so-called wall-attraction capabilities. The resulting algorithm is called the wall-attraction A* (W*) algorithm, and features a settable parameter that controls the balance between performance and admissibility of the solution. By conducting a set of experiments the influencing parameter is optimized. A case study is finally presented, featuring a conceptual aircraft environment that validates the above theories.

The problems in <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> <b>harness</b> installation include damge from sharp eges, work on adjacent harnesses, connector damage, and breaking wires. Engineering suggestions from the Apollo-era in reference to the conductors that are reviewed include: the use of plated conductors, and the use of alloys for stronger wiring. In refernce to insulation, the suggestions from Apollo era include the use of polymer tape-wrap wire insulation due to the light weight, however, other types of modern insulation might be more cost-effective. In reference to wire splices and terminal boards the suggestions from the Apollo Era include the use of crimp splices as superior to solder splices, joining multiple wire to a common point using modular plug-ins might be more reliable, but are heavier than crimp splicing.
