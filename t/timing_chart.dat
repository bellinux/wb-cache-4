50|$|As {{practice}} {{began on}} Friday, two bumps where the circuit rejoined the old layout {{at the end}} of the Seaside Way straight were causing problems. Some teams were concerned that the suspension on their cars would not last more than a few laps under race conditions. René Arnoux (Ferrari) was the first to go over the bumps flat out and his 1:26.935 led Alain Prost (Renault), Patrick Tambay (Ferrari) and Riccardo Patrese (Brabham) on the day's <b>timing</b> <b>chart,</b> while Nelson Piquet (Brabham), Lauda and Watson found their Michelin qualifying tires virtually useless and set poor times.|$|E

In the recent works, several <b>timing</b> <b>charts</b> of VA or MAP are presented, but there is no combined timing analysis of both algorithms.

50|$|The route has markers at {{one mile}} intervals. Although the race {{publicity}} (athlete advice, <b>timing</b> <b>charts</b> and so on) is mile-oriented, the individual timing splits {{that are available}} to competitors after the event are kilometre-oriented.|$|R
50|$|These charts {{are also}} used to {{estimate}} the velocities and accelerations of certain four bar links. The velocity of a link is the time rate at which its position is changing, while the link's acceleration is the time rate at which its velocity is changing. Both velocity and acceleration are vector quantities, in that they have both magnitude and direction; however, only their magnitudes are used in <b>timing</b> <b>charts.</b> When used with two mechanisms, <b>timing</b> <b>charts</b> assume constant acceleration. This assumption produces polynomial equations for velocity {{as a function of}} time. Constant acceleration allows for the velocity vs. time graph to appear as straight lines, thus designating a relationship between displacement (ΔR), maximum velocity (vpeak), acceleration (a), and time(Δt). The following equations show this.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} triple-mode MAP/VA timing charts {{that can}} run two different algorithms {{at the same}} time by complementing each other. Then, we address the implementation of a reconfigurable architecture for unified convolutional / turbo decoder design. According to the triple-mode MAP/VA <b>timing</b> <b>chart</b> and by merging some similar modules in both the Viterbi decoder and the log-MAP turbo code decoder, we build one unified component decoder with both of these two functions. Besides, in order to conform to the advance communication standard, our decoder can also perform as a reconfigurable trellis decoder. That is, our design meets the requirement of the multi generator polynomial in the convolutional code specification...|$|E

This paper exploited robot payload check program to make comparison of the differences between OBARA welding guns and 3 G welding guns. The results verified the advantages of 3 G welding guns. A case study to the application of 3 G welding guns to the body side was conducted, and Delmia, a 3 D platform for robotic simulation and OLP, was used to create the robot welding programs.

30|$|We {{report the}} seed/catalyst-free {{vertical}} growth of high-density electrodeposited ZnO nanostructures on a single-layer graphene. The absence of hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) and heat {{has resulted in}} the formation of nanoflake-like ZnO structure. The results show that HMTA and heat are needed to promote the formation of hexagonal ZnO nanostructures. The applied current density plays important role in inducing the growth of ZnO on graphene as well as in controlling the shape, size, and density of ZnO nanostructures. High density of vertically aligned ZnO nanorods comparable to other methods was obtained. The quality of the ZnO nanostructures also depended strongly on the applied current density. The growth mechanism was proposed. According to the growth <b>timing</b> <b>chart,</b> the growth seems to involve two stages which are the formation of ZnO nucleation and the enhancement of the vertical growth of nanorods. ZnO/graphene hybrid structure provides several potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics such as photovoltaic devices, sensing devices, optical devices, and photodetectors.|$|E

30|$|The {{electrochemically}} deposited Ga 2 O 3 was ammoniated in a {{quartz tube}} furnace {{as shown in}} Figure  1 b, at various times of 15, 30 and 45  min and temperatures of 800 °C, 850 °C and 900 °C under a flow of ammonia (NH 3) gas of 100 sccm at atmospheric pressure. The <b>timing</b> <b>chart</b> of ammoniating process is shown in Figure  1 c. Before starting the ammoniating process, the sample was put inside the quartz tube furnace and then the nitrogen (N 2) gas was purged for 10  min to flush out {{the air in the}} quartz tube. After that, the temperature was increased up to the setting temperatures, i.e. 800 °C, 850 °C and 900 °C from room temperature (RT) with a ramping rate of 28 °C/min. After reaching the setting temperature, N 2 gas was stopped and NH 3 gas was introduced into the furnace. The furnace was immediately switched off upon reaching the setting ammoniating time. At the same time, NH 3 gas was immediately stopped and N 2 gas was purged back into the furnace for 1  h to remove the remaining NH 3 gas during the cooling down process. The ammoniated structures were characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM; Hitachi SU 8083, Hitachi, Ltd, Chiyoda-ku, Japan), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker D 8 Advance, Bruker AXS, Inc., Yokohama-shi, Japan).|$|E
50|$|A {{mandatory}} test {{session for}} all sixty entries {{was held on}} 5 June, split into two sessions during the day. The morning session was led by Porsche, with Neel Jani setting a lap time of 3:22.334. The second Porsche followed, ahead of the two Audis and two Toyotas. Orecas led the LMP2 category with six cars {{at the top of}} the <b>timing</b> <b>charts,</b> led by the Signatech Alpine of Nicolas Lapierre ahead of Eurasia Motorsport and Manor. Porsche also led the LMGTE Pro category with a 1-2, the No. 92 ahead of the No. 91 and followed by the No. 63 Corvette. The No. 55 AF Corse Ferrari was the fastest in LMGTE Am, ahead of the second Ferrari of Scuderia Corsa.|$|R
25|$|The first {{qualifying}} session began late Wednesday night under clear conditions, as Porsche led {{the time}} sheets early {{on with a}} flying lap from Neel Jani in the No. 14 entry, followed by Hartley's three minutes and 23.157 seconds time a few laps later to top the session. The two Toyota cars stood two seconds back {{by the end of}} the session, although the No. 7 car suffered an oil leak and stopped on the side of the circuit, while the two participating Audi R18 e-tron quattro cars were three seconds adrift of the Porsche vehicles. Olivier Pla carried OAK Racing's Morgan to provisional pole in LMP2 with a time of three minutes 38.843 seconds ahead of the Signatech Alpine and KCMG Oreca. Nicolas Minassian in the No. 37 SMP Racing Oreca-Nissan caused a red flag for half an hour early in the session after crashing in the Porsche Curves. The Pro class of LMGTE was led by Gianmaria Bruni's AF Corse Ferrari, setting a pace of three minutes and 54.754 seconds. Aston Martin, Porsche, and Corvette all had cars within two seconds of the Ferrari. Aston Martin's second entry, driven by Fernando Rees, crashed at the Porsche Curves, forcing the session to be ended half an hour earlier than planned in order to repair the barriers. The Aston Martin would later be withdrawn from the race due to the damage to the car. At the premature end of the session, Andrea Bertolini's SMP Ferrari was at the top of the <b>timing</b> <b>charts</b> for LMGTE Am with a three minutes and 56.787 seconds lap time, followed by the No. 61 AF Corse Ferrari and Dempsey Porsche.|$|R

40|$|Reconfigurable {{devices are}} the {{mainstream}} in today’s {{system on chip}} solutions. Reconfigurable devices have the advantages of reduced cost over their equivalent custom design, quick time to market {{and the ability to}} reconfigure the design at will and ease. One such reconfigurable device is an FPGA. In this industrial thesis, the design and implementation of a control process interface using ECP 2 M FPGA and PCIe communication is accomplished. This control process interface is designed and implemented for a 3 -D plotter system called LSC 11. In this thesis, the FPGA unit implemented drives the plotter device based on specific <b>timing</b> requirements <b>charted</b> by the customer. The FPGA unit is interfaced to a Host CPU in this thesis (through PCIe communication) for controlling the LSC 11 system using a custom software. All the peripherals required for the LSC 11 system such as the ADC, DAC, Quadrature decoder and the PWM unit are also implemented as part of this thesis. This thesis also implements an efficient methodology to send all the inputs of the LSC 11 system to the Host CPU without the necessity for issuing any cyclic read commands on the Host CPU. The RTL design is synthesised in FPGA and the system is verified for correctness and accuracy. The LSC 11 system design consumed 79 % of the total FPGA resources and the maximum clock frequency achieved was 130 Mhz. This thesis has been carried out at Abaxor Engineering GmbH, Germany. It is demonstrated in this thesis how FPGA aids in quick designing and implementation of system on chip solutions with PCIe communication...|$|R
40|$|With the {{improvement}} of electronic technology, many navigational aid systems have been computerized. It is now heading to Web-based GIS technology for efficiency data distribution as to secure the safety of vessel navigation. Web-based GIS holds the potential to make distributed nautical charts information available to a very large worldwide audience. In practice, the Royal Malaysian Navy (RMN) took six months {{to more than a}} year to produce a new or updated chart. Therefore, any updates that are important to the users are published in Notice to Mariners by both RMN and Marine Departments monthly. Undoubtedly, this would cause some confusion to the mariners about the reliability of data, as two different departments manage the Notice to Mariners in different formats and <b>timing.</b> Moreover, nautical <b>charts</b> are widely used in offshore engineering works, fisheries industries, and others. All of these parties seek for the latest information about nautical chart in order to success their works. Since the charts are in different format, projection, symbolization and producers, they should be integrated for the needs of safety information. To overcome these problems, it is important to propose Web-based GIS system to manage and visualize nautical charts online. Thus, this paper studies on the creation of Nautical –WebGIS for sharing the charts information throughout Malaysia with the latest Notice to Mariners from both RMN and Marine Departments. The area of this study would be both MAL 5 (Peninsular Malaysia) and MAL 6 (Sabah and Sarawak). The Nautical –WebGIS will enable users to visualize, explore, and perform the queries on nautical charts for needed information...|$|R
40|$|Subject: LSS DESIGN Your {{attention}} {{is invited to}} the attached <b>chart</b> depicting the <b>timing</b> of planned NRC and DOE activities related {{to the design of}} the critical elements of the LSS system by DOE. The program elements on the chart are limited to design elements which are the most critical now from a <b>timing</b> standpoint. The <b>chart</b> is a modified and consolidated version of slides used by DOE in a briefing of the staff on October 13, 1988, although DOE now advises that some slippage is occurring in their design program. They expect to have new start/end dates in about a month. We believe the information in the chart will answer one of the questions raised in our recent meeting. Each DOE start time on the chart has been preceded with a one-month NRC/DOE interface period and a two-month NRC preparation phase before that. These NRC time frames were selected by SECY on an arbitrary basis, however, they do represent our belief that this is an adequate time to do the job. As indicated on the chart, DOE has already initiated design activities for several elements (data capture system, cataloging and thesaurus) without receiving official input by NRC. Comments were provided by individual NRC staff informally; others were provided by Chip representing input from various negotiating team members to him. None were based upon interactions among the several team members. Several new DOE activities will begin in early 1989 (retrieval software, database development and prototype test and evaluation). NRC has not initiated or scheduled the development of agency positions on any of these items, although we indicate on the chart that NRC's initial work should begin this month. In my judgement, the chart speaks for itself: NRC has already lost valuable time to identify and submit NRC's needs prior to DOE's initiation of the prototype and design efforts, and it must get organized quickly or fall further behind. amue Chilk Secre ar...|$|R
