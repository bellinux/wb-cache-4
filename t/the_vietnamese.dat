5|$|To resist <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> {{occupation}} of Kampuchea and the regime which they installed, the Khmer Rouge {{called on the}} Kampuchean people to unite and fight <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese.</b> However, due to the brutality which they had experienced under the deposed regime, many Kampucheans believed that any political movement aimed at restoring national freedom must oppose both the Khmer Rouge and <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese.</b> In response to such preconditions, two non-communist movements were formed to fight <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> occupation. The first group, a right-wing and pro-Western organisation, was formed in October 1979 by former Prime Minister Son Sann and was called the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF). The KPNLF operated from several refugee camps on the Thai-Cambodian border, where it controlled thousands of civilians. At its peak, the armed branch of the KPNLF were estimated to have between 12,000 and 15,000 fighters, but {{a third of that}} number were lost through fighting and desertions during <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> dry season offensive of 1984–85. Nonetheless, the KPNLF continued to operate in small groups, harassing <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> and their Kampuchean allies using guerrilla tactics.|$|E

5|$|During the Vietnam War, Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge communists {{had formed}} an {{alliance}} to fight U.S.-backed regimes {{in their respective}} countries. Despite their open display of cooperation with <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese,</b> the Khmer Rouge leadership feared that <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> communists were scheming to form an Indochinese federation with Vietnam as the dominant force in the region. In order to pre-empt an attempt by <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> to dominate them, the Khmer Rouge leadership began purging Vietnamese-trained personnel within their own ranks as the Lon Nol regime capitulated in 1975. Then, in May 1975, the newly formed Democratic Kampuchea, dominated by the Khmer Rouge, began attacking Vietnam, beginning with an attack on <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> island of Phú Quốc. In spite of the fighting, the leaders of reunified Vietnam and Kampuchea made several public diplomatic exchanges throughout 1976 to highlight the supposedly strong relations between them. However, behind the scenes, Kampuchean leaders continued to fear what they perceived as Vietnamese expansionism. As such, on 30 April 1977, they launched another major military attack on Vietnam. Shocked by the Kampuchean assault, Vietnam launched a retaliatory strike {{at the end of}} 1977 in an attempt to force the Kampuchean government to negotiate. In January 1978, <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> military withdrew because their political objectives had not been achieved—the Khmer Rouge remained unwilling to seriously negotiate.|$|E

5|$|Most Vietnamese are unrepresented in the Cambodian commune councils as {{they lack}} Cambodian citizenship.

5|$|For North Vietnamese field {{commanders of}} the Tay Nguyen Front, the {{withdrawal}} of South Vietnamese military forces from II Corps Tactical Zone came as a surprise, {{but it was not}} totally unexpected. What surprised <b>the</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> <b>the</b> most was the speed of the withdrawal. Indeed, {{it was not until the}} evening of March 15, when the ARVN 19th Armoured Cavalry Squadron reached Cheo Reo, that <b>the</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> began to receive information of Saigon’s decision to abandon the Central Highlands. At 8pm on March 16, the Tay Nguyen Front Command issued the first orders to pursue <b>the</b> South <b>Vietnamese.</b> <b>The</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> 9th Battalion, 64th Regiment, part of the 320A Infantry Division, was the first unit to be mobilised to intercept <b>the</b> South <b>Vietnamese</b> column south of Cheo Reo district. Subsequently, <b>the</b> entire North <b>Vietnamese</b> 320A Infantry Division was sent to destroy <b>the</b> South <b>Vietnamese</b> column along Route 7, with the 2nd Tank Battalion of the 273rd Armoured Regiment, the 675th Regiment, and the 593rd Anti-Aircraft Regiment in support. By the early hours of March 17, tanks from the ARVN 19th Armoured Cavalry Squadron and the 6th Ranger Battalion clashed with <b>the</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> 9th Battalion, 64th Regiment at Tuna Pass, about 4kilometres away from the district of Cheo Reo.|$|R

500|$|Back in Lang Vei, <b>the</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> {{continued}} to harass the small force of soldiers still {{trapped in the}} command bunker with hand grenades, explosives and bursts of gunfire down the stairwell that led into the bunker. Shortly after 06:00am, <b>the</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> threw several fragmentation grenades and tear gas grenades down the stairwell, causing panic amongst the defenders. Then, a voice called down <b>the</b> stairwell in <b>Vietnamese,</b> demanding <b>the</b> American-led forces give up at once. Following a quick discussion with his CIDG soldiers, <b>the</b> South <b>Vietnamese</b> special forces commander led his troops up the stairwell to surrender but were killed by North Vietnamese soldiers, [...] leaving behind their American counterparts. After <b>the</b> South <b>Vietnamese</b> had gone up, there was another short verbal exchange between the Americans in the bunker and <b>the</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> in English, which was followed by another fire-fight when the Americans refused surrender. At 06:30am, <b>the</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> successfully blasted a hole on the northern wall, gaining direct access into the command bunker. However, instead of launching a direct attack on the last American stronghold, <b>the</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> {{continued to}} throw grenades through the wall.|$|R
5|$|On February 17, 1859, the French {{warships}} {{opened fire}} on the citadel with artillery. This attack focused on the southeastern corner of the citadel, where most of <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> artillery had been installed. <b>The</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> artillery commanders had miscalculated and had set up their cannons incorrectly, firing at excessively high angles. The cannons were not easily adjusted and thus <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> firepower was misdirected and ineffective. At around 10:00, Captain Des Pallieres led 300 French soldiers in an infantry attack. They used bamboo ladders to scale the walls under artillery support from the river. The defenders were caught off guard by this manoevre and many fled in chaos.|$|E
5|$|The Cambodian King Chey Chettha II married <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Nguyễn lord Princess Nguyễn Thị Ngọc Vạn, a {{daughter}} of Lord Nguyễn Phúc Nguyên, in 1618.

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> support the CPP, and those who carry Cambodian citizenship would vote for the party. Vietnamese support for the CPP has mostly driven by strong anti-Vietnamese sentiments from other political parties. Although many members within {{the rank and file}} of the CPP share anti-Vietnamese sentiments with other political parties, the CPP maintained an openly neutral stance towards <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> community. According to Ehrentraut, the CPP's neutral stance was a balance between not providing open support for <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> community, which would have the potential effect of losing electoral votes to other political parties, {{while at the same time}} maintaining close ties with <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> government which the CPP had historical ties dating back to 1979. Vietnamese who hold Cambodian citizenship have also expressed fear over physical insecurity during election periods, which is most apparent during the 1993 and 2013 elections when Vietnamese civilians faced physical intimidation from the Khmer Rouge and CNRP supporters respectively and have abstained from participating in elections.|$|E

While <b>the</b> South <b>Vietnamese</b> army were disintegrating all over the battlefield, North Vietnam had two army corps moving towards <b>the</b> last South <b>Vietnamese</b> stronghold at Xuan Loc. <b>The</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> 4th Army Corps, which overran Phước Long several months earlier, approached Xuan Loc from the north-east after they conquered Tây Ninh, Binh Long and Long Khánh.

5|$|Vietnamese Cambodians {{refer to}} ethnic Vietnamese living in Cambodia. They mostly reside in southeastern parts Cambodia {{bordering}} Vietnam or on boathouses in the Tonlé Sap lake and Mekong rivers. The first Vietnamese came to settle modern-day Cambodia {{from the early}} 19th century during {{the era of the}} Nguyễn lords, and most of <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> came to Cambodia during the periods of French colonial administration and the People's Republic of Kampuchea administration. During the Khmer Republic and Khmer Rouge governments in the 1970s, <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> were targets of mass genocides; thousands of Vietnamese were killed and many more sought refuge in Vietnam. Ethnic relations between the Khmers and Vietnamese are poor, and <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> have been the main target of xenophobic attacks by political parties since the 1990s. Most of <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> are stateless residents of Cambodia, and as a result they face difficulties in getting access to education, employment and housing.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1928, the VNQDD {{attracted}} substantial Vietnamese support, provoking {{increased attention}} from the French colonial administration.

5|$|Ethnic Khmers have a poor {{perception}} of <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> community, due to persistent feelings of communal animosity {{from the past}} history of Vietnamese rule over Cambodia. In 1958, a survey conducted by Donald Willmott upon {{high school students in}} Phnom Penh showed that relations with Chinese were generally rated as friendly, whereas Khmer students viewed their Vietnamese classmates with suspicion. Relations between <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> and Chinese are considerably better, as both ethnic groups share a close cultural affinity. Chinese males sometimes take Vietnamese wives, particularly in Phnom Penh and eastern parts of the country where there are large Chinese and Vietnamese communities. In recent years, field research carried out by Ehrentraut in 2013 suggested that ethnic relations between Vietnamese have deteriorated not only with the ethnic Khmer, but also with the Cham and Chinese Cambodians.|$|E

25|$|The {{withdrawal}} had {{catastrophic effects}} on <b>the</b> South <b>Vietnamese</b> Army (ARVN).

Although it remained an effective fighting force throughout 1973 and 1974, by January 1975 it had disintegrated. <b>The</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> hurriedly attacked <b>the</b> much weakened South, and met with little resistance.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> never {{intended}} {{to abide by the}} agreement.

5|$|In 1978, when Vietnamese leaders {{launched}} their invasion of Kampuchea {{to remove the}} Khmer Rouge regime, they did not expect a negative reaction from the international community. However, the events that followed the invasion showed that Vietnamese leaders had severely miscalculated international sympathies towards their cause. Instead of backing Vietnam, most United Nations member countries denounced <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> {{use of force against}} Kampuchea, and even moved to revive the battered Khmer Rouge organisation that had once governed the country with such brutality. Thus, more than just a military problem, Kampuchea quickly evolved into an economic and diplomatic problem for Vietnam on the international arena. Throughout the decade in which Vietnam occupied neighbouring Kampuchea, <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Government, and the PRK regime which it installed, were placed {{on the periphery of the}} international community.|$|E
5|$|In Vietnam, {{heavy rains}} {{produced}} by the typhoon caused widespread flooding in northern provinces. Early assessments from <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> flood control committee indicated that 60,000hectares (148,000acres) of rice fields were submerged and 6,700metric tons (7,400short tons) of grain were soaked. High winds also caused extensive damage. At least 29,000homes collapsed and 119,000others were left roofless. Additionally, 572 hospitals or clinics were damaged. Several fatalities were reported in the region; however, they {{had yet to be}} verified by October12. Within two weeks of Brian's passage, Typhoons Angela and Dan struck the country, causing further damage and loss of life. Due to the rapid succession of storms, losses resulting from the three typhoons are difficult to differentiate. Because of the widespread damage caused by the storms, <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Government appealed for international assistance.|$|E
50|$|In 1969 Richard Nixon became President of the US {{and began}} the long process of winding down the Vietnam War and finding a {{political}} settlement. But this brought no immediate draw-down in Laos. The new administration pursued the same goals by the same means, and in fact during 1969 and 1970 the bombing campaign against <b>the</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> and Pathet Lao increased in intensity. In the spring of 1969 <b>the</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> attempted to hold the Plain of Jars through the rainy season. This led to a coordinated campaign that lead to a disastrous defeat of <b>the</b> North <b>Vietnamese.</b> Under constant pressure, their resistance collapsed in the Plain of Jars. They abandoned {{millions of dollars worth}} of military equipment and were chased almost to <b>the</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> border. <b>The</b> success however was short-lived. <b>The</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> launched a two-division counteroffensive led by a large tank force.

50|$|Meanwhile, on {{the evening}} of December 31, <b>the</b> South <b>Vietnamese</b> air force had flown more than 50 bombing sorties against North <b>Vietnamese</b> {{positions}} at <b>the</b> foot of Ba Ra mountain, temporarily stopping attacks from <b>the</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> 78th Special Forces Battalion. <b>The</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> responded to South Vietnamese air attacks by rolling out their long-range anti-aircraft guns, which stopped South Vietnamese pilots from hitting North <b>Vietnamese</b> positions until <b>the</b> next day, and allowing the 78th Special Forces Battalion to capture Ba Ra mountain. The capture of Ba Ra mountain enabled North Vietnamese army units to occupy the high ground areas surrounding Phước Long, where they could direct artillery fire against South <b>Vietnamese</b> positions. Throughout <b>the</b> day on January 1, 1975, <b>the</b> South <b>Vietnamese</b> air force conducted a further 53 bombing sorties, again temporarily delaying <b>the</b> North <b>Vietnamese</b> attack on Phước Long.

5|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> defence {{personnel}} were concentrated {{at the eastern}} gate of the citadel, where they stubbornly fought off the French. Rigault de Genouilly led 500 French troops in hand-to-hand combat for seven hours, having used explosives to breach the citadel. At 14:00, the French seized control of the citadel. Two hours later, de Genouilly declared the citadel as the new general headquarters of the French forces. The French seized a large arsenal. This included more than 200 cannons, 20,000 hand-held weapons such as firearms, pistols and swords, 100 tons of munitions, 80,000 tons of rice and 130,000 francs in cash.
