5|$|Israel {{provides}} a tantalising {{link between the}} spheres of masculine camaraderie of a conventional royal court and the more rarefied, scholarly atmosphere that Æthelstan may have liked both his contemporaries and posterity <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was keen to promote.|$|E
5|$|Later, Homer {{goes back}} to the {{farmhouse}} <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> sees old photographs, including one of himself as a child on Christmas morning, where he thinks his father was not even there when he finally got to meet Santa Claus. Homer then realizes that it was really his father in a Santa costume, proving that Grampa did actually care for him. Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to the farmhouse to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in the farmhouse – and they finally reconcile.|$|E
5|$|Philo of Alexandria, Josephus and Seneca {{state that}} Caligula was insane, but {{describe}} this madness as a personality trait {{that came through}} experience. Seneca states that Caligula became arrogant, angry and insulting once becoming emperor and uses his personality flaws as examples his readers can learn from. According to Josephus, power made Caligula incredibly conceited and led him <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was a god. Philo of Alexandria reports that Caligula became ruthless after nearly dying of an illness in the eighth month of his reign in AD 37. Juvenal reports {{he was given a}} magic potion that drove him insane.|$|E
60|$|Dave {{was both}} chagrined and angry--chagrined <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> {{had been taken}} in so easily, and angry <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> was a {{prisoner}} and at his captors' mercy.|$|R

25|$|Bennington {{suffered}} {{sexual abuse}} from an older male friend {{when he was}} seven years old. He was afraid {{to ask for help}} because he did not want people <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was gay or lying, and the abuse continued until the age of 13.|$|E
25|$|The Menezes family {{condemned}} the shooting and rejected the apology. His grandmother {{said there was}} 'no reason <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was a terrorist'. Although it was initially {{reported that they were}} offered almost £585,000 compensation, the Menezes family eventually received £100,000 in compensation from the Metropolitan Police.|$|E
25|$|During Savile's lifetime, {{sporadic}} {{allegations of}} child abuse were made against him dating back to 1963, but only became widely publicised after his death. Savile claimed {{the key to his}} success on Jim'll Fix It had been that he disliked children, although he later admitted to saying this to deflect scrutiny of his personal life. He did not own a computer as he did not want anybody <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was downloading child pornography. His autobiography As it Happens (1974, reprinted as Love is an Uphill Thing, 1976) contains admissions of improper sexual conduct which appear to have passed unnoticed during his lifetime.|$|E

25|$|Soon afterwards, Philip of Flanders {{arrived in}} Jerusalem on pilgrimage; he was Baldwin IV's cousin, {{and the king}} offered him the regency and command of the army, both of which Philip refused, {{although}} he objected to the appointment of Raynald as regent. Philip then attempted {{to intervene in the}} negotiations for Sibylla's second husband, and suggested one of his own retinue, but the native barons refused his suggestion. In addition, Philip seemed <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> could carve out a territory of his own in Egypt, but he refused to participate with the planned Byzantine-Jerusalem expedition. The expedition was delayed and finally cancelled, and Philip took his army away to the north.|$|E
25|$|Isaac became {{blind in}} his old age and decided to bestow {{the blessing of the}} firstborn upon Esau. According to the Midrash, Isaac had reached the age of 132, five years past the age his mother, Sarah, had been at her death. According to Genesis, Isaac had reached the age of 137. At this time, the Sages state that one should begin <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> might not exceed the age of {{whichever}} parent died first. Isaac therefore sent Esau out to the fields to trap and cook a piece of savory game for him, so that he could eat it and bless Esau before he died.|$|E
25|$|Beginning <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was {{indispensable}} at Radio 1, {{the first}} big falling-out with management came in December 1995 after taking his crew out on a 17-hour pub-crawl which ended two hours before they were due on air: Evans was fined one day's pay, £7,000. In 1996, broadcasting watchdogs investigated a continual trail of complaints against the show: Radio 1 refused to comment, Evans never said sorry. Evans also made increasing public demands of the Radio 1 management: after taking an extra week of unplanned holiday, Evans chose to turn up half an hour late for his 06:30 show and then demanded that his hours were changed {{so that it was}} a permanent fixture – this request was accepted.|$|E

25|$|Meier, in {{collaboration}} with former Vice President Hubert Humphrey and others, wanted to feed misinformation to the Nixon campaign. Meier told Donald that he was sure the Democrats would win the election because Larry O'Brien {{had a great deal}} of information on Richard Nixon's illicit dealings with Howard Hughes that had never been released; O'Brien did not actually have any such information, but Meier wanted Nixon <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> did. Donald told his brother that O'Brien was in possession of damaging Hughes information that could destroy his campaign. Terry Lenzner, who was the chief investigator for the Senate Watergate Committee, speculates that it was Nixon's desire to know what O'Brien knew about Nixon's dealings with Hughes that may have partially motivated the Watergate break-in.|$|E
500|$|British {{novelist and}} critic Kingsley Amis {{dismissed}} Campbell brusquely: [...] "I might just add as a sociological {{note that the}} editor of Astounding, himself a deviant figure of marked ferocity, seems <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has invented a psi machine." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1934, Kanō stopped giving public exhibitions. The {{reason was}} his failing health, {{probably}} compounded by kidney stones. The British judoka Sarah Mayer [...] wrote [...] "People don’t seem <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will live much longer" [...] {{to her friends}} in London. Nevertheless, Kanō continued attending important Kodokan events such as kagami-biraki (New Years' ceremonies) whenever he could, and he continued participating in Olympics business.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Festing, {{with quiet}} scorn. [...] "All that the brute insinuated is {{absolutely}} false. Bob's a fool, {{but he knows}} you, and I'm beginning <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> a little {{in love with his}} wife." ...|$|R

500|$|Meeting {{the rest}} of Pam's family and friends, Greg still feels like an outsider. Despite efforts to impress the family, Greg's {{inadvertent}} actions make him {{an easy target for}} ridicule, disdain and anger: He accidentally breaks Debbie's nose during a volleyball mishap; uses a malfunctioning toilet that floods the Byrnes' back yard with sewage; sets the wedding altar on fire and inadvertently leads Jack <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is a marijuana user. He also feels inferior to Kevin, Pam's ex-fiance who, unlike him, receives nothing but warmth and friendliness from Jack. Later, Greg loses Jinx and replaces him with a feral cat whose tail he spray paints to make him look like Mr. Jinx while desperately seeking Jack's approval.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{became a}} father {{for the first}} time during the 1982 season with the birth of his son O.J., today known as Nikko, on April 28. Smith also {{developed}} a lasting friendship with teammate Willie McGee during the season, and Smith said he likes <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> [...] "helped Willie get over some of the rough spots of adjusting to the major leagues". Smith later participated in the postseason {{for the first time}} when the Cardinals faced the Atlanta Braves in the best-of-five 1982 National League Championship Series (NLCS). Smith drove in the series' first run by hitting a sacrifice fly that scored McGee in Game 1, ultimately going five for nine in St. Louis' three-game series sweep.|$|E
500|$|While {{recovering}} in the hospital, Morenz {{received many}} get-well cards and visits from his teammates and players from other NHL teams. So {{many of them}} brought drinks that a teammate remarked that [...] "the whisky was on the dresser and the beer was under the bed." [...] Though there were many visitors, Morenz often found himself alone in the hospital room, unable to move off his bed. To pass the time, he read newspapers to stay up to date with the Canadiens as they finished the season. Since his injury, the team had dropped in the standings, causing Morenz to worry. He began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would never play hockey again and became depressed.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, Juliano starts <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> {{actually}} bisexual {{instead of}} gay. Hermínia is also worrying about beloved Aunt Zélia, {{who is now}} dealing with Alzheimer's disease.

5000|$|In 2017, Bob Dylan {{was asked}} {{about how he was}} {{referenced}} in the song. [...] "A jester? Sure, the jester writes songs like 'Masters of War,' 'A Hard Rain’s a-Gonna Fall,' 'It’s Alright, Ma' - some jester. I have <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he’s</b> talking about somebody else. Ask him." ...|$|R
500|$|In 1948, Thompson went 12–8 for the Maple Leafs, {{the second-best}} win–loss record among the team's regular {{starting}} pitchers (20 or more starts). He was {{third on the}} team with 161 innings pitched, allowed the most earned runs (91), and posted a 5.09 ERA. At {{the end of the}} season, manager Eddie Sawyer called Thompson and Jim Konstanty up to the major league level. As per the working agreement between the teams, the major league club paid Toronto for the rights to each Maple Leafs player it called up: $25,000 ($ in current terms) for the first player, and $5,000 ($ currently) for each player thereafter. Sawyer recalled that Pete Campbell, Toronto's owner, and Konstanty [...] "didn't get along... they were both the same". Although Campbell was [...] "glad to get rid of Konstanty", he told Sawyer to take Thompson as the $25,000 player because he did not want Konstanty <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was worth the larger fee.|$|E
500|$|Knight felt a {{parallel}} to George in that his [...] "confidence isn't always at its absolute highest", but overall he sees more differences than similarities. However, when the actor starts <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{is so different}} from O'Malley, an awkward move can suggest otherwise. [...] "I was walking, doing a scene with Katherine Heigl. I finished my line with her, and then I walked straight into the light stand." [...] Critical of her affair with O'Malley, Knight's co-star Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it." [...] Speaking of O'Malley's relationship with Lexie, Rhimes offered her insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They're really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater." [...] When asked what his [...] "favorite George moment" [...] was, Knight said his relationships with Stevens and Bailey.|$|E
500|$|Steve Kloves was {{selected}} to write the screenplay. He described adapting the book as [...] "tough", as it did not [...] "lend itself to adaptation {{as well as the}} next two books." [...] Kloves often received synopses of books proposed as film adaptations from Warner Bros., which he [...] "almost never read", but Harry Potter jumped out at him. He went out and bought the book, and became an instant fan of the series. When speaking to Warner Bros., he stated that the film had to be British, and had to be true to the characters. Kloves was nervous when he first met Rowling as he did not want her <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> was going to [...] " [...] her baby." [...] Rowling admitted that she [...] "was really ready to hate this Steve Kloves," [...] but recalled her initial meeting with him: [...] "The first time I met him, he said to me, 'You know who my favourite character is?' And I thought, You're gonna say Ron. I know you're gonna say Ron. But he said 'Hermione.' And I just kind of melted." [...] Rowling received a large amount of creative control, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.|$|E
