In 1899, <b>the</b> American <b>Tobacco</b> Company {{organized}} a New Jersey corporation, called <b>the</b> Continental <b>Tobacco</b> Company, that took a controlling interest in many small tobacco companies. By 1910, James Buchanan Duke controlled Lorillard and <b>the</b> American <b>Tobacco</b> Company even as it kept its original name.

5|$|Dudley was {{credited}} with discovering that a toxic component of tobacco smoke is carbon monoxide (which poisons the blood by interfering with oxygen's ability to bind to hemoglobin).

His experiments showed the toxic agent to be carbon monoxide, resulting alike from cigarette, pipe, or cigar.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 16th century, Europeans' {{interest}} in the New World revolved around gold and silver and not tobacco. The European lack of interest in tobacco was due to the fact that the Amerindians controlled <b>the</b> <b>tobacco</b> industry; as long as the Amerindians controlled the supply there was no need for the incorporation in European commercial capitalism.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{cultivation}} of <b>Tobacco</b> in America led to many changes. During <b>the</b> 1700s <b>tobacco</b> {{was a very}} lucrative crop due to its high demand in Europe. The climate of the Chesapeake area in America lent itself very nicely to <b>the</b> {{cultivation of}} <b>tobacco.</b> <b>The</b> high European demand for tobacco led to a rise in <b>the</b> value of <b>tobacco.</b> <b>The</b> rise of value of <b>tobacco</b> accelerated <b>the</b> economic growth in America. <b>The</b> cultivation of <b>tobacco</b> as a cash crop in America marks the shift from a subsistence economy to an agrarian economy. Tobaccoâ€™s desirability and value led to it {{being used as a}} currency in colonies. Tobacco was also backed by the gold standard which meant that there was an established conversion rate from tobacco to gold.|$|R

5|$|The Bristol Old Vic, {{founded in}} 1946 as an {{offshoot}} of The Old Vic in London, occupies the 1766 Theatre Royal (607 seats) on King Street; the 150-seat New Vic (a studio-type theatre), and a foyer and bar in the adjacent Coopers' Hall (built in 1743). The Theatre Royal, a grade I listed building, is the oldest continuously operating theatre in England. The Bristol Old Vic Theatre School (which originated in King Street) is a separate company, and the Bristol Hippodrome is a 1,951-seat theatre for national touring productions.

5|$|Though {{inhabited}} {{prior to}} the 16th century, {{little is known about}} Barbadian music before the arrival of the Portuguese in 1536 and then the English in 1627. The Portuguese left little influence, but English culture and music helped shape the island's heritage. Irish and Scottish settlers emigrated in the 17th century, working in <b>the</b> <b>tobacco</b> industry, bringing still more new music to the island. The middle of the 17th century saw the decline of <b>the</b> <b>tobacco</b> industry and the rise of sugarcane, as well as the introduction of large numbers of African slaves. Brazilian exiles however, along with sugarcane introduced Samba to the island which featured a mixture of Latin music with African influences which soon developed into Soca-Samba which is indigenous to Barbados. Modern Barbadian music is thus largely a combination of English and African elements, with Irish, Scottish, and modern American and Caribbean (especially Jamaican) influences as well.|$|E
