Still, controversy remained, and fellow Mercury astronaut Wally Schirra, {{at the end of his}} October 3, 1962, flight, remained inside his spacecraft until it was safely aboard the recovery ship, and made a point of deliberately blowing the hatch to get out, bruising his hand.|$|E
5|$|One CMPC {{shooting}} {{location was}} on family property near Boulder Creek, California where Middleton's father {{had established a}} timber holding {{now known as the}} Middleton Tract. Other filming locations included undeveloped portions of Sonoma, Santa Cruz and Marin counties. In San Rafael, the studio boasted a large glass-walled and -roofed building that let in light but not wind so that shooting for indoor scenes could take place in full light without <b>the</b> <b>telltale</b> flapping of tablecloths and clothing blown by gusts. Considered expensive at the time, the company used a 1,250 Bell & Howell movie camera, worth about $ in current value. The camera held two reels of film so that two negatives were made of each scene. A second $700 camera provided a third reel of the same scene, from another perspective.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Taub, {{using his}} {{experience}} as a plastic surgeon, gains Kenny's and his father's trust and frequently clashes with House on the diagnosis. House believes Kenny is suffering juvenile rheumatoid arthritis while Taub believes it is merely the side effects of increased intracranial pressure. By persuading Kenny's father not to follow House's treatment and by attempting to kick him off the case, House fires Taub, only to have his decision reversed by Cuddy. Ultimately both House and Taub are proven wrong when Thirteen realizes Kenny is suffering Lyme disease, with <b>the</b> <b>telltale</b> rash hidden by his hair. Incensed by Taub's actions, House begins to dig into his life, and gets him to confess that he resigned his old position as a plastic surgeon because he was discovered having a secret affair with his nurse. He signed a non-compete agreement with his former partners in exchange for their keeping quiet about the affair, effectively blackballing him out of his area of expertise.|$|E
5|$|The prime universe's Peter succumbs to {{his illness}} and dies, and Walter {{and his wife}} Elizabeth (Orla Brady) mourn their loss, {{supported}} by Walter and William's friend, Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) and Walter's lab assistant, Carla Warren (Jenni Blong). Walter, through his window, shows Elizabeth the other Peter, and asserts they should be happy knowing another Peter exists. Later, Walter watches Walternate explore other cures. Walternate is distracted {{by the arrival of}} an Observer, September (Michael Cerveris), and fails to see <b>the</b> <b>telltale</b> color change indicating a cure. Walter is able to recreate and stabilize Walternate's cure, and then decides to use untested equipment to cross over to give the cure to Peter. Carla tries to stop Walter, knowing the technology could damage the fabric of space-time, and contacts Nina for help. Separately, September informs his fellow Observers that he may have made a mistake and assures them he will correct it.|$|E

25|$|Crystals {{produced}} by the Verneuil process are chemically and physically equivalent to their naturally occurring counterparts, and strong magnification is usually required {{to distinguish between the}} two. One of <b>the</b> <b>telltale</b> characteristics of a Verneuil crystal is curved growth lines (curved striae) formed as the cylindrical boule grows upwards in an environment with a high thermal gradient; the equivalent lines in natural crystals are parallel. Another distinguishing feature is the common presence of microscopic gas bubbles formed due to an excess of oxygen in the furnace; imperfections in natural crystals are usually solid impurities.|$|E
25|$|A {{diagnosis}} of gastric dilatation-volvulus {{is made by}} several factors.

Shock is diagnosed {{by the presence of}} pale mucous membranes with poor capillary refill, increased heart rate, and poor pulse quality. Radiographs (x-rays), usually taken after decompression of the stomach if the dog is unstable, will show a stomach distended with gas. The pylorus, which normally is ventral and {{to the right of the}} body of the stomach, will be cranial to the body of the stomach and left of the midline, often separated on the x-ray by soft tissue and giving the appearance of a separate gas filled pocket (double bubble sign).|$|E
500|$|The {{mountains}} of Glacier National Park began forming [...] {{years ago when}} ancient rocks were forced eastward up and over much younger rock strata. Known as the Lewis Overthrust, these sedimentary rocks are considered {{to have some of}} the finest examples of early life fossils on Earth. The current shapes of the Lewis and Livingston mountain ranges and positioning and size of the lakes show <b>the</b> <b>telltale</b> evidence of massive glacial action, which carved U-shaped valleys and left behind moraines which impounded water, creating lakes. Of the estimated 150 glaciers which existed in the park in the mid-19th century, only 25 active glaciers remained by 2010. Scientists studying the glaciers in the park have estimated that all the glaciers may disappear by 2030 if current climate patterns persist.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, LucasArt's license with Purcell {{that gave}} {{them the right to}} produce games based on the Sam & Max {{franchise}} expired; this allowed Purcell to take the franchise to Telltale Games, a new company formed by members of Stemmle's development team. A new episodic series of Sam & Max games, Sam & Max Save the World, was announced. Purcell's work on the new game series encompassed design and writing, as well as the design of the game's cover art; despite his work, Purcell described it as [...] "minimal" [...] due to the effectiveness of the team. At the same time, Purcell began a Sam & Max webcomic hosted on <b>the</b> <b>Telltale</b> Games website. The webcomic ran for twelve issues, and it earned Purcell an Eisner Award for [...] "Best Digital Comic" [...] when the comic finished its run in 2007. Purcell assisted with design and writing when Sam & Max Beyond Time and Space began development in 2007. Through Telltale Games, he released two sketchbooks of his Sam & Max work and a 20th anniversary edition of Sam & Max: Surfin' the Highway in 2008.

500|$|Newton, using old {{technology}} from Walter and Bell's research, {{is able to}} pull an entire building from the parallel universe to the prime, and the team races against time to prevent harm when, due {{to the laws of}} mass conservation, a building from the prime is pulled to the parallel one. This event forces Walter to try to coax Olivia to recall her Cortexiphan abilities as to identify things affected by the parallel universe. Initially unable to do so, her fear of failure enables her ability, allowing them to save the people within the target building, but also revealing to her that Peter is from the parallel universe. Walter explains to Olivia that in 1985, he and Bell had devised a way to observe the parallel universe, where he found his doppelgänger, [...] "Walternate", was also close to losing his son. Though Walter's Peter had died, Walternate continued to search for a cure, but missed <b>the</b> <b>telltale</b> sign when the Observer September arrived at his lab. Walter resynthesized the cure and aimed to cross over using untested equipment at Reiden Lake, though stalled by Nina and his lab assistant Clara. Nina tackled him on his way over, losing her arm in the process, while Walter, on the other side, found the cure vial broken. Intent on curing the alternate Peter, he posed as his father and crossed back with Peter, intending to administer the cure at the lab and then return Peter. However, on the return, the ice on Reiden Lake broke, threatening to drown both, but they were saved by September, who cautioned Walter [...] "the boy must live". While Walter successfully administered the cure, his wife Elizabeth saw Peter, and Walter realized he could never return Peter to the parallel universe. After Walter reveals this truth, he considers letting Peter know but struggles with how to do so, hoping to seek repentance from God for his actions.|$|E
