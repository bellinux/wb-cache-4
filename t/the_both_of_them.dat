25|$|The {{differences}} between the two models are the scale length (445mm of free string length in Lisboa guitars and 470mm in Coimbra guitars), body measurements, and other finer construction details. Overall, the Coimbra model is of simpler construction than the Lisboa model.

Lisboa guitars usually employ a narrower neck profile as well. Both models have a very distinct timbre, the Lisboa model having a more bright and resonant sound, and the choice between <b>the</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> falls upon each player's preferences.|$|E
