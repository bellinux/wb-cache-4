40|$|Abstract: <b>Tutors</b> {{generally}} play a {{vital role}} towards the academic success of students at the University of Johannesburg (UJ), South Africa, with specificity of this study on engineering students. As such, UJ continually invest in the drive of <b>tutors</b> through the Academic Development Centre (ADC) towards activity-based education of students or interaction (ABE/I) with students. In most cases, the activity-based interaction between <b>tutors</b> and engineering students may differ amongst <b>tutors</b> however, one common element remains the teaming/grouping of students with one or more <b>tutors</b> as head of the team in different subject/module. Nonetheless, it is emphasized that <b>tutors</b> do not act to assume or supposedly function as lecturers to students. Notwithstanding, the exact role of a <b>tutor</b> in activity-based education is somewhat indistinct to both <b>tutors</b> as well as to students. Nevertheless, to streamline and better inform the <b>tutors</b> of their role and performance as well as help them improve, the study opted for open and closed item questionnaire aimed at appraising the supporting hands/performance of individual <b>tutors</b> in one active semester term. <b>Tutors</b> responses to the open item questions informed the study about their strengths and weaknesses. While responses to the closed items provided insight to the supporting hands of a <b>tutor</b> with respect to the functional operation of a team/group, individual learning processes, the progress of the activity/task, the approach of the <b>tutor</b> to activity-based education and the <b>tutor’s</b> role in imbibing in the students development of critical thinking and problem solving skills...|$|R

We find that features extracted from the reflective dialogue context produce the most predictive models. Also, the <b>tutor</b> abstracts more often when the student shows signs of working at a very detailed level for awhile, and prompts for specification when the student’s responses are imprecise. ...|$|R
