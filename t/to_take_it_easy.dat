5|$|On 19 May 2014, {{the news}} {{reported}} that McCartney had been bedridden on doctor's orders {{due to an}} unspecified virus, which forced him to cancel a sold-out concert tour of Japan that was scheduled to begin later in the week. The tour would have included {{a stop at the}} famed Budokan Hall. McCartney also had to push his June US dates to October, as part of his doctor's order <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> to make a full recovery. However, he resumed the tour with a high-energy three hour appearance in Albany, New York, on 5 July 2014. On 14 August 2014, McCartney performed the final concert at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, California before its demolition. It was the same venue that the Beatles played their final concert in 1966.|$|E
5|$|Peart {{got a job}} in Lakeside Park, in Port Dalhousie on {{the shores}} of Lake Ontario, which later {{inspired}} a song of the same name on the Rush album Caress of Steel. He worked on the Bubble Game and Ball Toss, but his tendency <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> when business was slack resulted in his termination. By his late teens, Peart had played in local bands such as Mumblin’ Sumpthin’, the Majority, and JR Flood. These bands practiced in basement recreation rooms and garages and played church halls, high schools and roller rinks in towns across Southern Ontario such as Mitchell, Seaforth, and Elmira. They also played in the northern Ontario city of Timmins. Tuesday nights were filled with jam sessions at the Niagara Theatre Centre.|$|E
25|$|George P. Wilbur, who {{was cast}} as Michael Myers for this film, wore hockey pads under the costume {{to make himself}} look more {{physically}} imposing. During filming, {{the cast and crew}} made it a point <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> on Danielle Harris, as she was only a young child at the time, and made sure that she was not scared too badly and knew that none of it was real; to this end, Wilbur regularly removed the mask in front of her in order to remind her that it was just a movie and {{he was not going to}} hurt her.|$|E
5000|$|Jones {{entered the}} 1968 NORRA Mexican 1000 (now Baja 1000). Jones led until the 150 mi marker. The Off-road Motorsports Hall of Fame {{describes}} Jones' racing style: [...] "Jones and Stroppe {{had to find}} a way to keep their vehicles in one piece. During races Jones would push the vehicles at maximum speeds until they gave way, with Stroppe telling him at top volume the entire time <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> on the vehicle." ...|$|R
50|$|This is a {{dream come}} true. It is the happiest day of my life. Tears came to my eyes {{because of all the}} work we did to achieve this result. It is Honda's victory. It is the team's victory. I {{suffered}} very much when I was not at the wheel of the car, it is very different. There were times in which I wanted him to go faster, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier,</b> but I did not want to influence what Anthony was doing at the wheel of the car. We formed a great driver pairing, sincerely", said López, full of emotion.|$|R
5000|$|Second and Third Terms:In 2008 Lane {{decided to}} run for Santa Cruz City Council again. In a Santa Cruz Sentinel article he stated that his {{platform}} was nearly the same as before. He would focus on jobs and affordable housing. He emphasized that what changed was [...] "my style rather than my views. I've learned <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> and I have more experience working with people. I’m more collaborative in my style now.” He won a seat on the Council in 2008 and received enough votes to become mayor for a year during his four-year term.|$|R
500|$|Triggered by {{the death}} of Krusty's father, Lisa becomes obsessed with {{protecting}} her own father, [...] Homer, from getting hurt. She wraps him in bubble wrap, which ends up saving his life when Otto's school bus plows into the garden. Eventually Marge and Bart talk some sense into Lisa, that while it is nice of her to be concerned for her father, she should not force Homer <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> on himself and just let him live his life.|$|E
500|$|In early May 1967, Taylor {{announced}} that Smile had been scrapped, but the Beach Boys were still under pressure and {{a contractual obligation}} to record and present an album to Capitol. On June 2, Brian declared to his bandmates {{that most of the}} material recorded for Smile was now off-limits. According to Carl, [...] "Brian just said, 'I can't do this. We're going to make a homespun version of it instead. We're just going <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy.</b> I'll get in the pool and sing. Or let's go in the gym and do our parts.' That was Smiley Smile." [...] In interviews conducted over the next year, Brian intimated that he had run out of ideas [...] "in a conventional sense", and that he was [...] "about ready to die". He says: [...] "I decided not to try any more, and not try and do such great things ... And we had so much fun. The Smiley Smile era was so great, it was unbelievable. Personally, spiritually, everything, it was great. I didn't have any paranoia feelings." [...] Carl described the end product as [...] "a bunt instead of a grand slam".|$|E
2500|$|Artist Nick Cardy, a {{colleague}} at the Eisner studio, said Powell [...] "came in later when I was doing [...] 'Lady Luck'. He was sitting behind me. He would help a kid {{around the block}} — tell a newcomer <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> {{and that sort of}} thing".|$|E
6000|$|He drove on, and Carrie {{attempted}} to frown. [...] "Isn't he exasperating?" [...] she said. [...] "The doctor {{told him he}} was <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> very <b>easy</b> for at least another month, and he promised me he would do nothing hard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has fallen}} doubly on me," [...] said Lady Lydiard; [...] "and I am {{certainly}} not rich enough <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> that <b>easy.</b> The money {{was destined to}} a charitable purpose; and I have felt it my duty to pay it again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hate {{to use up}} my brains {{studying}} {{an automobile}} guide," [...] Chester Waltham had returned with a yawn. [...] "When I am on an outing I like <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> just as <b>easy</b> as I possibly can." ...|$|R
2500|$|Some {{found it}} hard to believe that the punch could have floored a man like Liston. Hall of Fame {{announcer}} Don Dunphy said, [...] "Here was a guy who was in prison and the guards used to beat him over the head with clubs and couldn't knock him down." [...] But others contend that he wasn't the same Liston. Dave Anderson of the New York Times said Liston [...] "looked awful" [...] in his last workout before the fight. Liston's handlers secretly paid sparring partner Amos Lincoln an extra $100 <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> on him. Arthur Daley of the New York Times wrote that Liston's handlers knew he [...] "didn't have it anymore." [...] These comments don't accord with the fact that Liston easily beat Amos Lincoln three years later in 1968, knocking him out inside two rounds.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope so, but {{she ought}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> {{the rest of}} her days. She's done work enough--and I'm kind o' {{discouraged}} myself." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{three boys}} had quite some sport {{going up the}} lake with Della Ford and her aunt as passengers. Being towed by the motor-boat, they had nothing <b>to</b> do but <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy,</b> and they spent the time in chatting of things in general, and of moving {{pictures}} and fun on Mirror Lake in particular.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the almost}} {{constant}} touring and recording with The Prodigy, Maxim rarely {{had a chance}} to create solo material. After the band started <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easier</b> after the intense touring to support The Fat of the Land in late 1997, he finally had the spare time to work and finish some of his projects. That year he released [...] "Dog Day" [...] on the XL promo Against the Grain, which also featured Howlett's [...] "Dirtchamber Remix" [...] of [...] "Diesel Power" [...] (from The Fat of the Land) and Maxim's cover version of the Rolling Stones' [...] "Factory Girl". On 9 August 1999 Maxim released the EP My Web, which contained five tracks. In 2000 Maxim had a collaboration with Skin from Skunk Anansie on the song [...] "Carmen Queasy", which remains his biggest solo success. It peaked at No. 33 on the UK Singles Chart in June 2000. A second single, [...] "Scheming", was released 11 September and reached UK #53, and the album Hell's Kitchen, was released on 2 October 2000. Maxim's second solo album, Fallen Angel, was released in 2005 and spawned one single, [...] "I Don't Care," [...] which failed to chart. The album was released in multiple formats, including a limited edition CD.|$|R
30|$|It is {{worthwhile}} {{to mention that}} magnesium nitride films, which have many technological applications, {{are the ones that}} are relatively less investigated by researchers. Hence, in the present work, for the first time, we succeeded using plasma focus device, magnesium nitride thin films on stainless steel- 304 substrates <b>to</b> synthesize <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy.</b> For this purpose, the samples are placed at the constant distance of 8  cm from the top end of the anode and exposed to the different number of focus shots (15, 25 and then 35 shots) at the 0 ° angular position in line with anode.|$|R

6000|$|... "Take your seat," [...] {{said the}} tramp leader. [...] "I'd feel mighty {{proud of myself}} if I let you go and spoil the game. You'll stick right in this camp until we finish the job. The end of that brick pile is your limit. You go two inches beyond that, and I'll have <b>to</b> shoot. Better <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy,</b> now." ...|$|R
60|$|September came, and as {{the days}} grew shorter, some of Peter's friends bade him good-by. They were {{starting}} on the long journey, planning <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> in <b>easy</b> stages for the most part. Each day saw some slip away. As Peter thought {{of the dangers of}} the long trip before them he wondered if he would ever see them again. But some there were who lingered even after Jack Frost's first visit. Welcome and Mrs. Robin, Winsome and Mrs. Bluebird. Little Friend the Song Sparrow and his wife were among these. By and by even they were forced to leave.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Say!' cried Mark. 'That I'd take {{anything}} I could get. [...] "If that's so," [...] says the mate, [...] "why, bring {{a glass of}} rum;" [...] which they brought according. And my wages, sir,' said Mark in high glee, 'pays your passage; and I've put the rolling-pin in your berth <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> (<b>it's</b> the <b>easy</b> one up in the corner); and there we are, Rule Britannia, and Britons strike home!' ...|$|R

60|$|With {{nothing of}} special {{importance}} to do, the whole crowd slept {{late on the}} following morning, which was Sunday. Dick Rover was glad <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy,</b> but declined to have a physician when that was suggested.|$|E
5000|$|The video {{starts with}} footage from the 2007 MuchMusic Video Awards {{of the band}} and Chadam walking down the street, with {{screaming}} fans on the sidewalks, and an interviewer asks [...] "You guys gonna get all wasted tonight? Up to your normal antics?" [...] Bert responds, [...] "Nah, we're a little partied out, we'll probably try <b>to</b> <b>take,</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>easy</b> and chill out afterward," [...] after which a huge party is shown with the aforementioned antics being performed throughout. Jeph Howard also appears as a cross-dressed prostitute in the video. In one of the videos, he flashes the camera. At the end, the piece of dialogue at the beginning is repeated with this added afterward by the reporter: [...] "What are you guys wusses or somethin'?".|$|R
6000|$|... "Dick," [...] he rejoined, [...] "we haven't yet {{had time}} to gain much {{experience}} {{in the world of}} high finance, but here's one little truism which you can <b>take</b> <b>to</b> heart. <b>It's</b> <b>easier</b> to get the best of a rogue than of a jay. The jay as a rule knows he's a jay, and is terrified all the time lest other people should find it out. The rogue believes that he's cleverer than he is, and that other people are bigger fools than they are.... Shall we--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a very old-fashioned way," [...] she said, {{knitting}} industriously {{at something}} as dainty and pink as a sunset cloud. [...] "But I am old-fashioned. My clothes are, and {{it stands to}} reason my opinions are, too. I don't say they're any the better of that, mind you. In fact, I daresay they're a good deal the worse. But they've worn nice and easy. New shoes are smarter than old ones, but the old ones are more comfortable. I'm old enough to indulge myself in the matter of shoes and opinions. I mean <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> real <b>easy</b> here. I know you expect me to look after you and keep you proper, but I'm not going to do it. You're old enough to know how to behave if you're ever going to be.

40|$|Successive {{waves of}} {{legislation}} {{have resulted in}} a very large {{decrease in the number of}} smokers in Australia. Yet smoking remains a massive health problem for Australia, and there is evidence that progress on quitting has stalled.

Fisher rejoined the Pioneers in 1949 when Brady left. The highlight of this era came in 1951 when they appeared at Carnegie Hall, making them the first western band to perform there. They would also {{be the first to}} play at lavish nightclubs in Las Vegas and starred on Mutual Radio's Lucky U Ranch program. In 1953, Fisher left to join friend Ken Curtis in television and motion pictures but again returned to the Pioneers in 1955, replacing Deuce Spriggens.
