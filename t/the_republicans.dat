5|$|Kennedy's role as {{a liberal}} lion in the Senate {{came to the fore}} in 1995, when the Republican Revolution took control and {{legislation}} intending to fulfill the Contract with America was coming from Newt Gingrich's House of Representatives. Many Democrats in the Senate and the country overall felt depressed but Kennedy rallied forces to combat <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b> By the beginning of 1996, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> had overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass the Senate and the Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it coming out of Kennedy's staff.|$|E
5|$|Saudis and Jordanians {{provided}} an active {{support to the}} royalists through {{the first years of}} war. The September 1962 coup d'état in Yemen was perceived a threat to the monarchies in both Saudi Arabia and Jordan, prompting shipments of weapons to the royalists, beginning October 1. The support to the monarchists was quickly countered by the Egyptian aid to <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> rapidly spiraling the country into a full-scale war, as <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> called for general mobilization and the Egyptians dispatching troops. On November 4, with the war expanding across North Yemen, the Mecca Radio reported of Egyptian air force attacks on Saudi villages. The same day, a military alliance of Saudi Arabia and Jordan became widely known. Following the Egyptian raids on Saudi Arabia and the official Joint Defense Pact formed between Egypt and <b>the</b> <b>Republicans,</b> the Saudis decided to launch attacks on <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> in North Yemen.|$|E
