5|$|Bristol won the Type I and <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> contracts, {{delivering}} their Type I design, the Bristol Brabazon in 1949. The {{requirement for}} the 1946 British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) Medium Range Empire (MRE) Requirements coincided with the <b>Type</b> <b>III,</b> Specification C.2/47, issued in April 1947 by the Minister of Supply. The specifications called for an airliner capable of carrying 48 passengers and powered with Bristol Centaurus radial engines or Napier Nomad turbo-compound diesel engine. Turboprop options were also considered, but they were so new that Bristol could not guarantee the performance specifications.|$|E
5|$|Archaea, a {{group of}} prokaryotes {{separate}} from bacteria, also feature flagella driven by rotary motor proteins, which are structurally and evolutionarily distinct from bacterial flagella. Whereas bacterial flagella evolved from the bacterial <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> secretion system, archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from Type IV pili.|$|E
5|$|In the US, {{there are}} four types of ambulances. There are Type I, Type II, <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> and Type IV. Type I is based upon a heavy truck chassis and is used {{primarily}} for Advanced Life Support and rescue work. Type II is a van based ambulance with little modifications except for a raised roof. Its use is for basic life support and transfer of patients. The <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> is a van chassis but with a custom made rear compartment and has the same use as Type I ambulances. Type IV's are nomenclature for smaller ad hoc patient transfer using smaller utility vehicles where passenger vehicles and trucks would have difficulty in traversing, such as large industrial complexes, commercial venues, and special events with large crowds. These do not, generally, fall under Federal Regulations.|$|E

5|$|As part of Romblon, Banton is {{classified}} under <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> of the Corona climatic classification system. This type of climate {{is described as}} having no prominent wet or dry seasons. The wet season, which usually occurs from June to November can extend up to December during {{the onset of the}} southwest monsoon. The dry season from January to May may sometimes have periods of rainfall or even inclement weather.|$|E
5|$|Immune {{complexes}} (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) {{deposited in}} various tissues trigger <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes {{between two and}} three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy). These reactions are mediated by T cells, monocytes, and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|Archaea flagella operate like {{bacterial}} flagella—their long stalks {{are driven}} by rotatory motors at the base. These motors are powered by the proton gradient across the membrane. However, archaeal flagella are notably different in composition and development. The two types of flagella evolved from different ancestors. The bacterial flagellum shares a common ancestor with the <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion system, while archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from bacterial type IV pili. In contrast to the bacterial flagellum, which is hollow and is assembled by subunits moving up the central pore {{to the tip of}} the flagella, archaeal flagella are synthesized by adding subunits at the base.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the belief that}} an extraterrestrial civilization would want to establish an empire, Ćirković proposes that an extraterrestrial civilization would maintain equilibrium rather than expand outward. In such an equilibrium, a civilization would only colonize a small number of stars, aiming to maximize efficiency rather than to expand massive and unsustainable imperial structures. This contrasts with the classic Kardashev <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> civilization, which has access to the energy output of an entire galaxy and is not subject to any limits on its future expansion. According to this view, advanced civilizations may not resemble the classic examples in science fiction, but might more closely reflect the small, independent Greek city-states, with an emphasis on cultural rather than territorial growth.|$|E
5|$|Spontaneous {{cases are}} {{considered}} to be caused by intrinsic factors that weaken the arterial wall. Only a very small proportion (1–4%) have a clear underlying connective tissue disorder, such as Ehlers–Danlos syndrome type 4 and more rarely Marfan's syndrome. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type 4, caused by mutations of the COL3A gene, leads to defective production of the collagen, <b>type</b> <b>III,</b> alpha 1 protein and causes skin fragility as well as weakness of the walls of arteries and internal organs. Marfan's syndrome results from mutations in the FBN1 gene, defective production of the protein fibrillin-1, and a number of physical abnormalities including aneurysm of the aortic root.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} any {{pathogen}} {{depends on its}} ability to elude host immune responses. Therefore, pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host, while evading detection or destruction by the immune system. Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier, for example, by using a type II secretion system. Alternatively, using a <b>type</b> <b>III</b> secretion system, they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell, providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host. These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses.|$|E

5|$|Toxin-antitoxin {{systems are}} {{typically}} classified {{according to how}} the antitoxin neutralises the toxin. In a Type I toxin-antitoxin system, the translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes the toxin is inhibited by the binding of a small non-coding RNA antitoxin to the mRNA. The protein toxin in a type II system is inhibited post-translationally by the binding of another protein antitoxin. A single example of <b>Type</b> <b>III</b> toxin-antitoxin system has been described whereby a protein toxin is bound directly by an RNA molecule. Toxin-antitoxin genes are often transferred through horizontal gene transfer and are associated with pathogenic bacteria, having been found on plasmids conferring antibiotic resistance and virulence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Type</b> <b>III</b> toxin-antitoxin systems rely {{on direct}} {{interaction}} between a toxic protein and an RNA antitoxin. The toxic {{effects of the}} protein are neutralised by the RNA gene. One example is the ToxIN system from the bacterial plant pathogen Erwinia carotovora. The toxic ToxN protein is approximately 170 amino acids long and {{has been shown to}} be toxic to E. coli. The toxic activity of ToxN is inhibited by ToxI RNA, an RNA with 5.5 direct repeats of a 36 nucleotide motif (AGGTGATTTGCTACCTTTAAGTGCAGCTAGAAATTC). Crystallographic analysis of ToxIN has found that ToxN inhibition requires the formation of a trimeric ToxIN complex, whereby three ToxI monomers bind three ToxN monomers; the complex is held together by extensive protein-RNA interactions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Type</b> <b>III</b> systems, like type I require six {{or seven}} Cas {{proteins}} binding to crRNAs. The <b>type</b> <b>III</b> systems analysed from S. solfataricus and P. furiosus both target the mRNA of phages rather than phage DNA genome, which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.|$|E

30|$|Throughout {{development}} and adulthood, differences in collagen concentrations can be observed: collagen <b>types</b> <b>III</b> and V are predominantly found pericellularly and within meniscal surface layers (Eyre & Wu, 1983; Bland & Ashhurst, 1996). A matrix containing collagen <b>types</b> I, <b>III</b> and V {{is found in}} the rabbit as early as at embryonic day 25. Only at 3 postnatal weeks, the menisci also contain collagen type II, which increases with further maturation (Bland & Ashhurst, 1996).|$|R
25|$|Human {{interferon}} alpha-2 (IFNα2) is a cytokine {{belonging to}} the family of type I IFNs. IFNα2 is a protein secreted by cells infected by a virus and acting on other cells to inhibit viral infection. The first description of IFNs as a cellular agent interfering with viral replication was made by Alick Isaacs and Jean Lindenmann in 1957. The history of this finding was recently reviewed. There are 3 types of IFNs: Interferon type I, Interferon type II and Interferon <b>type</b> <b>III.</b> The type II IFN, also called IFNγ, is produced by specific cells of the immune system. Unlike type I and <b>type</b> <b>III</b> IFNs, IFNγ has only a modest role in directly restricting viral infections. Type I and <b>type</b> <b>III</b> IFNs act similarly. However, the action of <b>type</b> <b>III</b> IFNs, also known as IFNλ, is limited to epithelial cells while type I IFNs act on all body's cells.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{study the}} {{serotype}} distributions of group B streptococci (GBS) isolated from blood and cerebrospinal fluid {{and from the}} genital tract of pregnant women and to investigate any possible relation between serotype, age and clinical manifestation. MethodsInvasive strains were collected from 1988 to 1997 and genital strains from 1995 to 1996. Strains of GBS were serotyped with coagglutination. Clinical data were obtained from hospital notes. ResultsA total of 144 invasive strains, 78 from neonates and infants and 66 from adults, were serotyped. The most common isolates from neonates and infants were <b>types</b> <b>III</b> (62 %), Ia (18 %), and V (9 %). The most common isolates from adults were <b>types</b> <b>III</b> (29 %), Ib (23 %), V (21 %) and II (15 %). A majority of the adults (94 %) had an underlying medical condition.
