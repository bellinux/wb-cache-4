5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of the San Theodoran carnival was drawn largely from images of the Nice Carnival. Among the revelers, he included those dressed in the costumes of various different cartoon and film characters, such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Asterix, Snoopy, Groucho Marx, and Zorro. Hergé also included a band known as the Coconuts into the carnival scene; these were not developed by Hergé himself but were rather the creations of his friend and colleague Bob de Moor, who had devised them for his own comic series, Barelli. <b>The</b> <b>street</b> <b>that</b> they were marching down, Calle 22 de Mayo, was named after Hergé's own birthday, 22 May.|$|E

Development to the northeast was restricted by a brick wall that had been built by the Earl's cousin, Edward Russell, 3rd Earl of Bedford, in 1610 as a land boundary and remained undeveloped for some time. It was eventually built on around 1673-7, with eleven properties constructed.|$|E

5|$|This {{artificial}} lake {{is connected to}} {{the east side of the}} Segaran Lake via a 380 meter long canal that runs east to west.

5|$|On Halloween, Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is carving a jack-o'-lantern while {{preparing}} {{to take his}} daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) trick-or-treating. As he leaves to collect her, he notices a demonic figure watching him from across <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>That</b> night, Jordan deliberately passes by one house, telling Black that it is haunted. Black tells her {{there are no such}} thing as ghosts, but is reminded of a moment from his past. In a flashback, we see a five-year-old Black being dared by his friends to knock the door of the same house; a man named Crocell (Dean Winters) answers and invites Black inside. Crocell is a Second World War veteran, and he explains the meaning of Halloween to Black, telling the boy that it is the one night of the year that ghosts walk among the living. Crocell hopes that it is his chance to commune with the friends he lost in the war, and is dismayed when the young Black dismisses the possibility of ghosts.|$|E

5|$|With closer {{proximity}} to schools, more parking, and double {{the availability of}} shelf space, the village purchased the former station for $12,500 ($ today) and leased the building and its acre of land to the library. The library required $20,500 ($ today) for purchasing and renovating the building; it raised $14,000 ($ today) from village residents, with the remainder funded by the village board. On April 19, 1959, the refurbished building was dedicated and the village board named <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>that</b> led to the library Library Road. With its own space, the library increased its collection, hired more staff, and doubled its operating hours. Also in 1959, the library received its absolute charter, and transferred the charter in 1964 from a free library association to a fully tax-supported public library and thus changed {{its name from the}} Briarcliff Free Library to the Briarcliff Manor Public Library.|$|E
