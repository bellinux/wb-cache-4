5|$|In 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency sued MIT {{for violating}} <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Water</b> Act and the Clean Air Act {{with regard to}} its {{hazardous}} waste storage and disposal procedures. MIT settled the suit by paying a $155,000 fine and launching three environmental projects. In connection with capital campaigns to expand the campus, the Institute has also extensively renovated existing buildings to improve their energy efficiency. MIT has also taken steps to reduce its environmental impact by running alternative fuel campus shuttles, subsidizing public transportation passes, and building a low-emission cogeneration plant that serves most of the campus electricity, heating, and cooling requirements.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency {{is charged}} with {{regulating}} and managing mercury contamination. Several laws give the EPA this authority, including the Clean Air Act, <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Water</b> Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Additionally, the Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act, passed in 1996, phases out the use of mercury in batteries, and provides for the efficient and cost-effective disposal of many types of used batteries. North America contributed approximately 11% of the total global anthropogenic mercury emissions in 1995.|$|E

5|$|Frank {{meets with}} Walker's Chief of Staff, Linda Vasquez (Sakina Jaffrey), whom Frank {{recommended}} for the job. She reveals {{that she and}} Walker have decided to rescind their promise to nominate him as Secretary of State because {{they want him to}} remain in Congress and use his political expertise to get the President-elect’s education reform agenda passed. Frank is initially incensed, but when Linda asks if he will continue to be an ally to the future President he says that he will. Linda reveals that Senator Michael Kern (Kevin Kilner) has been chosen for the position instead. Despite his statement to the contrary, Frank feels personally betrayed and, with Claire’s encouragement, begins to formulate a plot for revenge, which he shares with his Chief of Staff, Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly). Mrs. Underwood, meanwhile, is forced to downsize the non-profit organization she manages, <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Water</b> Initiative, which had been promised a large donation upon her husband’s confirmation as Secretary, without which the organization is forced to substantially curtail its budget.|$|E
5|$|However, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board {{withheld}} its {{permit approval}} in December 2000, over {{concerns that the}} Sweetwater Reservoir could be polluted in the process. Such an approval was necessary under <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Water</b> Act {{in order to get}} the necessary approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The suit by Preserve South Bay was dismissed in March 2001, on the grounds that the legislature did not need to review the annexation of state parkland for the highway because it was done under eminent domain. In April, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board approved the project on several conditions, including monitoring the water quality to ensure that the Sweetwater Reservoir would remain a clean water source for local residents. An appeal to the state Water Resources Control Board to overturn the approval was unsuccessful. In July, the USACE approved the wetlands permit for the southern portion of SR 125.|$|E
5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. Environmental policy {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed <b>the</b> <b>Clean</b> <b>Water</b> Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E
