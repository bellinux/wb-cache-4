40|$|The aims of this {{research}} were to determine the level of satisfaction with pharmacy services among enrollees of a managed care organization, compare the level of satisfaction between mail pharmacy and <b>traditional</b> <b>pharmacy</b> patrons, and evaluate the relationship between satisfaction with pharmacy services and health status. Data was collected via telephone interviews with 1, 362 enrollees of the managed care organization. The overall response rate was 65 %. Satisfaction was measured using previously developed items for <b>traditional</b> <b>pharmacy</b> services, and newly developed, parallel items for mail pharmacy services. Scores were calculated for hypothesized multi-item dimensions of satisfaction. Health status was measured using the {{physical and mental health}} composite scores of the SF- 12 Health Survey. Satisfaction with pharmacy services was compared between patron groups using ANOVA and ANCOVA models. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to evaluate the dimensional structure of satisfaction with pharmacy services and the relationship between satisfaction with pharmacy services and health status. The results indicated that mail pharmacy patrons were more satisfied than <b>traditional</b> <b>pharmacy</b> patrons with their pharmacy services in general, and specifically with the financial aspects and technical quality of those services. When the comparisons were adjusted for general satisfaction with medical care and mental health status, mail pharmacy patrons still had greater levels of general satisfaction with pharmacy services. However, when these covariates were included in the comparison of satisfaction with financial aspects and technical quality of pharmacy services, dimension scores between the two patron groups were not significantly different. Internal consistency reliability coefficients for the multi-item dimensions of satisfaction were in the range of 0. 53 to 0. 77, {{with the exception of the}} Written Information dimension for mail pharmacy service, where the alpha coefficient was 0. 37. A positive correlation between the dimension scores for general satisfaction with pharmacy services and general satisfaction with medical care lends support to the construct validity of the measurements. Additionally, it was concluded that, as expected, general satisfaction with pharmacy services was positively correlated with mental health status, but there was no significant relationship between physical health and satisfaction with pharmacy services...|$|E

Hands-on patient training on inhalers and glucose meters is not feasible with remote dispensing, and administration of injections is impossible without a physically present pharmacist. Other cognitive services such as in-depth medication consultations are also impractical to conduct over such audiovisual technology, which do not provide acoustic privacy for the patient, nor do they meet mandatory criteria for conducting such services that require an “in-person discussion” to occur.

40|$|Because of {{the current}} inavailability of Kinevac, the form of {{sincalide}} for injection approved by the U. S.

The FDA recognizes that pharmacists traditionally have extemporaneously compounded and manipulated reasonable quantities of human drugs on receipt of a valid prescription for an individually identified patient from a licensed practitioner (2). For more than 40 years, nuclear pharmacies have demonstrated an outstanding record of providing safe and reliable compounded drugs.

All traditional dosage forms as well as their definitions, descriptions and considerations were extracted by reviewing “Qarābādin-e-Sālehi”. Then, the textbook of “Aulton's Pharmaceutics; the design and manufacture of medicines” was considered to compare the medieval knowledge of pharmaceutics with current ones. Overall, there were 226 different dosage forms which have been cited in <b>traditional</b> Persian <b>pharmacy.</b> Since many of them were related to the preparation method, the final list of dosage form was shortened to nearly 60 items including solid, semisolid, liquid and gaseous forms.
