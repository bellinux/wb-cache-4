5|$|A {{number of}} Egyptian commanders wanted <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> general war to regain {{at least a}} {{significant}} part of the Sinai.

Sadek cited studies in opposition of a limited offensive; Egyptian analyses estimated 17,000 casualties in a canal crossing, while Soviet estimates placed casualty figures at 35,000 troops. Sadek stressed the immense losses that would be sustained would overshadow any military and political gains from a limited offensive, which required following up by liberating all or most of the Sinai.|$|E
