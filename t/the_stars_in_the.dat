5|$|Finally {{the tidal}} radius, or Hill sphere, is the {{distance}} {{from the center of the}} globular cluster at which the external gravitation of the galaxy has more influence over <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cluster than does the cluster itself. This is the distance at which the individual stars belonging to a cluster can be separated away by the galaxy. The tidal radius of M3 is about 40 arc minutes, or about 113 pc at the distance of 10.4 kpc.|$|E
5|$|The Sun is a G-type {{main-sequence star}} that {{comprises}} about 99.86% {{of the mass}} of the Solar System. The Sun has an absolute magnitude of +4.83, estimated to be brighter than about 85% of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Milky Way, most of which are red dwarfs.|$|E
5|$|The Sun is a G2-type main-sequence star. Hotter main-sequence {{stars are}} more luminous.

5|$|A shell {{galaxy is}} a type of {{elliptical}} galaxy where <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> galaxy's halo are arranged in concentric shells. About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. The shell-like structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy. As the two galaxy centers approach, the centers start to oscillate around a center point, the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the shells of stars, similar to ripples spreading on water. For example, galaxy NGC 3923 has over twenty shells.|$|E
5|$|A star is a {{luminous}} sphere of plasma {{held together by}} its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are {{visible to the naked}} eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are in{{visible to the naked eye}} from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes.|$|E
5|$|After {{they are}} formed, <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{globular}} cluster begin to interact gravitationally with each other. As a result, the velocity vectors {{of the stars}} are steadily modified, and the stars lose any history of their original velocity. The characteristic interval for this to occur is the relaxation time. This {{is related to the}} characteristic length of time a star needs to cross the cluster as well as the number of stellar masses in the system. The value of the relaxation time varies by cluster, but the mean value is on the order of 109 years.|$|E

5|$|After two sabbaticals to Harvard, Baker's {{interest}} {{moved from}} photometry to the Milky Way. In 1939 the 30-inch reflector {{was replaced with}} a Ross photographic telescope and {{for more than ten}} years after that, 1939 through 1951 Baker used the observatory's photographic telescope to help count <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Milky Way and determine their distribution as part of Harvard's Star Counting Circuit. This would be the primary research until Baker's retirement in 1951. The 12-inch refractor was only used for instruction, public open houses and for visiting school groups.|$|E

5|$|Taurus {{became an}} {{important}} object of worship among the Druids. Their Tauric religious festival was held while the Sun passed through the constellation. Among the arctic people known as the Inuit, the constellation is called Sakiattiat and the Hyades is Nanurjuk, with the latter representing {{the spirit of the}} polar bear. Aldebaran represents the bear, with the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hyades being dogs that are holding the beast at bay. In Buddhism, legends hold that Gautama Buddha was born when the Full Moon was in Vaisakha, or Taurus. Buddha's birthday is celebrated with the Wesak Festival, or Vesākha, which occurs on the first or second Full Moon when the Sun is in Taurus.|$|E

However, <b>The</b> Order of <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> East was founded by the President of the Theosophical Society, Annie Besant, because Krishnamurti was seen as the Theosophical Society's [...] "World Teacher" [...] so an association between the two organisations did exist. <b>The</b> <b>Star</b> Amphitheatre was constructed <b>in</b> 1923-1924 at Balmoral Beach in Sydney, Australia.|$|R

5|$|The Milky Way is a barred {{spiral galaxy}} with a {{diameter}} between 100,000 and 180,000 light-years. The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars. There are probably at least 100 billion planets in the Milky Way. The Solar System is located within the disk, about 26,000 light-years from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge {{of one of the}} spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust called the Orion Arm. <b>The</b> <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inner ≈10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. The very center is marked by an intense radio source, named Sagittarius A*, which {{is likely to be a}} supermassive black hole.|$|E
5|$|Italian {{navigator}} Amerigo Vespucci {{explored the}} New World {{at the beginning}} of the 16th century. He learnt to recognize <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> southern hemisphere and made a catalogue for his patron king Manuel I of Portugal, which is now lost. As well as the catalogue, Vespucci wrote descriptions of the southern stars, including a triangle which may be either Triangulum Australe or Apus. This was sent to his patron in Florence, Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici, and published as Mundus Novus in 1504. The first depiction of the constellation was provided in 1589 by Flemish astronomer and clergyman Petrus Plancius on a -cm diameter celestial globe published in Amsterdam by Dutch cartographer Jacob Floris van Langren, where it was called Triangulus Antarcticus and incorrectly portrayed to the south of Argo Navis. His student Petrus Keyzer, along with Dutch explorer Frederick de Houtman, coined the name Den Zuyden Trianghel. Triangulum Australe was more accurately depicted in Johann Bayer's celestial atlas Uranometria in 1603, where it was also given its current name.|$|E
5|$|The first direct {{measurement}} of the distance to a star (61 Cygni at 11.4 light-years) was made in 1838 by Friedrich Bessel using the parallax technique. Parallax measurements demonstrated the vast separation of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heavens. Observation of double stars gained increasing importance during the 19th century. In 1834, Friedrich Bessel observed changes in the proper motion of the star Sirius and inferred a hidden companion. Edward Pickering discovered the first spectroscopic binary in 1899 when he observed the periodic splitting of the spectral lines of the star Mizar in a 104-day period. Detailed observations of many binary star systems were collected by astronomers such as Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve and S. W. Burnham, allowing the masses of stars to be determined from computation of orbital elements. The first {{solution to the problem}} of deriving an orbit of binary stars from telescope observations was made by Felix Savary in 1827.|$|E

5|$|The {{space between}} <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> M87 galaxy {{is filled with}} a diffuse {{interstellar}} medium of gas, which has been chemically enriched by the elements ejected from stars as they passed beyond {{the end of their}} main sequence lifetime. Carbon and nitrogen are continuously supplied by intermediate mass stars as they pass through the asymptotic giant branch. The heavier elements from oxygen to iron are primarily produced by supernova explosions within the galaxy. About 60% of the abundance of these heavy elements was produced by core-collapse supernovae, while the remainder came from Type Ia supernovae. The distribution of these elements suggests that early enrichment was from core-collapse supernovae. The contribution from these sources was much lower in abundance than in the Milky Way. Type Ia supernovae have provided a continuous contribution to the interstellar medium of M87 throughout the history of the galaxy.|$|E

The man is unscathed, but the woman sustains a wound to her leg, which they wrap with a flag brought from when they were creating the sand castle. Deciding that traveling in search of people towards the top of the mountain, where they see a structure, would be a better medical option than heading back home, they continue towards the mountaintops. As night falls, they rest in the wild. The man takes the first guard shift, and <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> night sky time lapse behind him.
