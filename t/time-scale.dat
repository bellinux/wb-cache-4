The ancient Greek astronomers, Hipparchus and Ptolemy, had noted several periodic variations in the Moon's orbit, such as small oscillations in its orbital eccentricity and the inclination of its orbit to the plane of the ecliptic. These oscillations generally occur on a once-monthly or twice-monthly <b>time-scale.</b> The line of its apses precesses gradually with a period of roughly 8.85 years, while its line of nodes turns a full circle in roughly double that time, 18.6 years. This accounts for the roughly 18-year periodicity of eclipses, the so-called Saros cycle. However, both lines experience small fluctuations in their motion, again on the monthly <b>time-scale.</b>|$|E

In this century, some authors have begun to discuss the existence of solutions of boundary value problems on <b>time-scales</b> (see [16 – 22]). There have been many approaches to study the existence and the multiplicity of solutions for differential equations on <b>time-scales,</b> such as methods of lower and upper solutions, fixed-point theory, and coincidence degree theory.

On a larger <b>time-scale,</b> cyclic changes in climate and sea level are caused by Milankovitch cycles: cyclic changes in the orientation and/or position of the Earth's rotational axis and orbit around the Sun.

25|$|An abrupt {{climate change}} {{occurs when the}} climate system is forced to {{transition}} to a new climate state {{at a rate that}} is determined by the climate system energy-balance, and which is more rapid than the rate of change of the external forcing. Past events include the end of the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse, Younger Dryas, Dansgaard-Oeschger events, Heinrich events and possibly also the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum. The term is also used within the context of global warming to describe sudden climate change that is detectable over the <b>time-scale</b> of a human lifetime. One proposed reason for the observed abrupt climate change is that feedback loops within the climate system both enhance small perturbations and cause a variety of stable states.|$|E
25|$|Wavelet {{theory is}} {{applicable}} to several subjects. All wavelet transforms {{may be considered}} forms of time-frequency representation for continuous-time (analog) signals and so are related to harmonic analysis. Almost all practically useful discrete wavelet transforms use discrete-time filterbanks. These filter banks are called the wavelet and scaling coefficients in wavelets nomenclature. These filterbanks may contain either finite impulse response (FIR) or infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. The wavelets forming a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) {{are subject to the}} uncertainty principle of Fourier analysis respective sampling theory: Given a signal with some event in it, one cannot assign simultaneously an exact time and frequency response scale to that event. The product of the uncertainties of time and frequency response scale has a lower bound. Thus, in the scaleogram of a continuous wavelet transform of this signal, such an event marks an entire region in the <b>time-scale</b> plane, instead of just one point. Also, discrete wavelet bases may be considered in the context of other forms of the uncertainty principle.|$|E

25|$|Research {{advanced}} {{so quickly}} {{that the need for}} an up-to-date checklist became apparent. Mary Parke (1902–1981), who was a founder member of the British Phycological Society, produced a preliminary checklist of British marine algae in 1953, corrections and additions of this were published in 1956, 1957 and 1959. In 1964 M.Parke and Peter Stanley Dixon (1929–1993) published a revised check-list, a second revision of this was produced in 1968 and a third revision in 1976. Distribution was added to the checklist in 1986 with G.R.South and I.Tittley's A Checklist and Distributional Index of the Benthic Marine Algae of the North Atlantic Ocean. In 2003 A Check-list and Atlas of the Seaweeds of Britain and Ireland was published by Gavin Hardy and Michael Guiry with a revised edition in 2006. This shows how rapidly knowledge of algae, at least in the British Isles, advanced. First efforts had been made by interested biologists and people capable of identifying the algae, this required books using the botanical names. Botanical keys to identify the plants then developed, followed by checklists. As more information was brought to light by interested workers, some volunteers, the checklists were improved and eventually a mapping scheme brought together all this information. The same pattern of knowledge developed with birds, mammals and flowering plants, though to a different <b>time-scale</b> and knowledge {{in other parts of the}} world has developed to this degree.|$|E
25|$|The protein or {{membrane}} environment {{could respond}} to an external field {{in a number of}} different ways. Field induced dipoles, reorientation of permanent dipoles, protonation and deprotonation of protein residues, larger scale reorganization of ionized side-chains and water molecules, both within the interior and on the surface of the protein, are all examples of how complicated the assignment of permittivity is. In MD simulations, where all the charges, dipoles, and field induced atomic dipoles are treated explicitly then it is suggested that a dielectric value of 1 is appropriate. However, in reduced-particle ion simulation programs, such as ours, where the protein, membrane, and water are continuum backgrounds and treated implicitly, and on top of that, the ion motion takes place on the same <b>time-scale</b> as the protein’s response to its presence, it is very difficult to assign the dielectric coefficients. In fact, changing the dielectric coefficients could easily alter the channel characteristics, such as ion permeation and selectivity The assignment of dielectric coefficient for water is another key issue. The water molecules inside ion channels could be very ordered due to tapered size of the pore, which is often lined with highly charged residues, or hydrogen bond formation between water molecules and protein. As a result, the dielectric constant of water inside an ion channel could be quite different from the value under bulk conditions. To make the matter even more complicated, the dielectric coefficients of water inside nanopores is not necessarily an isotropic scalar value, but an anisotropic tensor having different values in different directions.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of interference, there are two factors at play when recalling a list of items: the recency and the primacy effects. The recency effect occurs when the {{short-term}} memory is used to remember the most recent items, and the primacy effect occurs when the long-term memory has encoded the earlier items. The recency effect can be eliminated {{if there is a}} period of interference between the input and the output of information extending longer than the holding time of short-term memory (15–30 seconds). This occurs when a person is given subsequent information to recall preceding the recall of the initial information. The primacy effect, however, is not affected by the interference of recall. The elimination of the last few items from memory is due to the displacement of these items from short term memory, by the distracting task. As they have not been recited and rehearsed, they are not moved into long-term memory and are thus lost. A task as simple as counting backwards can change memory recall; however an empty delay interval has no effect. This is because the person can continue to rehearse the items in their working memory to be remembered without interference. Cohen (1989) found that there is better recall for an action in the presence of interference if that action is physically performed during the encoding phase. It has also been found that recalling some items can interfere and inhibit the recall of other items. Another stream of thought and evidence suggests that the effects of interference on recency and primacy are relative, determined by the ratio rule (retention interval to inter item presentation distractor rate) and they exhibit <b>time-scale</b> invariance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Our goal in {{this article}} is to {{characterize}} temporal patterns of violent civilian deaths in Iraq. These patterns are expected to evolve on <b>time-scales</b> ranging from years to minutes as a result of changes in the security environment on equally varied <b>time-scales.</b> To assess the importance of multiple <b>time-scales</b> in evolving security threats, we develop a self-exciting point pro cess model similar to that used in earthquake analysis. Here the rate of violent events is partitioned into a background rate and a foreground self-exciting component. Background rates are assumed to change on relatively long <b>time-scales.</b> Foreground self-excitation, in which events trigger an increase in the rate of violence, is assumed to be short-lived. We explore the model using data from Iraq Body Count on civilian deaths between 2003 and 2007. Our results indicate that selfexcitation makes up as much as 37 – 50 per cent of all violent events and that self-excitation lasts at most between two and six weeks, depending upon the district in question. Appropriate security responses may benefit from taking these different <b>time-scales</b> of violence into consideration...|$|R

The soft and hard band Power-Spectral Densities (PSDs) of these sources demonstrate variability {{over a wide range}} of <b>time-scales.</b> However, on <b>time-scales</b> of tens of seconds, corresponding to the putative low-frequency Lorentzian in the PSD, there is additional power in the soft band. To interpret this behaviour, we introduce a new spectral analysis technique, the `covariance spectrum', to disentangle the contribution of the X-ray spectral components to variations on different <b>time-scales.</b> We use this technique to show that the disc blackbody component varies on all <b>time-scales,</b> but varies more, relative to the power-law, on longer <b>time-scales.</b> This behaviour explains the additional long-term variability seen in the soft band. Comparison of the blackbody and iron line normalisations seen in the covariance spectra in GX 339 - 4 implies that the short-term blackbody variations are driven by thermal reprocessing of the power-law continuum absorbed by the disc. However, since the amplitude of variable reflection is the same on long and short <b>time-scales,</b> we rule out reprocessing as the cause of the enhanced disc variability on long <b>time-scales.</b> Therefore we conclude that the long-time-scale blackbody variations are caused by instabilities in the disc itself, in contrast to the stable discs seen in BHXRB soft states. Our results provide the first observational evidence that the low-frequency Lorentzian feature present in the PSD is produced by the accretion disc. Comment: 12 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

This result could partly be attributed to the omission from the gridded data set of a small number of sites (<1%) with clear urban-related warming trends. In a worldwide set of about 270 stations, Parker (2004, 2006) noted that warming trends in night minimum temperatures over the period 1950 to 2000 were not enhanced on calm nights, which would be the time most likely to be affected by urban warming. Thus, the global land warming trend discussed is very unlikely to be influenced significantly by increasing urbanisation (Parker, 2006). ... Accordingly, this assessment adds the same level of urban warming uncertainty as in the TAR: 0.006°C per decade since 1900 for land, and 0.002°C per decade since 1900 for blended land with ocean, as ocean UHI is zero.|$|E
