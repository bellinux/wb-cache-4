50|$|Directed {{sets are}} a {{generalization}} of nonempty <b>totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>sets.</b> That is, all <b>totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>sets</b> are directed <b>sets</b> (contrast partially <b>ordered</b> <b>sets,</b> which {{need not be}} directed). Join semilattices (which are partially <b>ordered</b> <b>sets)</b> are directed sets as well, but not conversely. Likewise, lattices are directed sets both upward and downward.|$|R

25|$|The right order {{topology}} or left order topology on any bounded <b>totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>set</b> is compact. In particular, Sierpiński {{space is}} compact.|$|E

25|$|A {{bijective}} map between two <b>totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>sets</b> that respects the two orders is an isomorphism in this category.|$|R
2500|$|The {{lexicographical}} {{order on}} the Cartesian product {{of a family of}} <b>totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>sets,</b> indexed by a well <b>ordered</b> <b>set,</b> is itself a total order.|$|R
25|$|Intervals are {{likewise}} defined on {{an arbitrary}} <b>totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>set,</b> such as integers or rational numbers. The notation of integer intervals is {{considered in the}} special section below.|$|E
25|$|While {{chain is}} {{sometimes}} merely {{a synonym for}} <b>totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>set,</b> it can also refer to a totally ordered subset of some partially ordered set. The latter definition has {{a crucial role in}} Zorn's lemma.|$|E
25|$|A {{sequence}} {{is a function}} whose domain is a countable, <b>totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>set,</b> usually taken to be the natural numbers or whole numbers. Occasionally, it is also convenient to consider bidirectional sequences indexed by the set of all integers, including negative indices.|$|E
50|$|Another {{possible}} ordering on A &times; B is the lexicographical order. Unlike the latter, {{the product}} <b>order</b> of two <b>totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>sets</b> is not total. For example, the pairs (0, 1) and (1, 0) are incomparable {{in the product}} order of 0 < 1 with itself. The lexicographic <b>order</b> of <b>totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>sets</b> is however a linear extension of their product order. In general, the product order is a subrelation of the lexicographic order.|$|R

50|$|Any ηα set X is {{universal}} for <b>totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>sets</b> of cardinality at most ℵα, meaning {{that any such}} set can be embedded into X.|$|R
25|$|A <b>totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>set</b> {{is said to}} be {{complete}} if every nonempty subset that has an upper bound, has a least upper bound. For example, the set of real numbers R is complete but the set of rational numbers Q is not.|$|E
25|$|A <b>totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>set</b> (with its order topology) {{which is}} a {{complete}} lattice is compact. Examples are the closed intervals of real numbers, e.g. the unit interval , and the affinely extended real number system (extended real number line). There are order-preserving homeomorphisms between these examples.|$|E
25|$|Any monoid with {{cancellation}} {{that is not}} a {{group is}} unstable, because if a is an element {{that is not a}} unit then the powers of a form an infinite <b>totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>set</b> under the relation of divisibility. For a similar reason any integral domain that is not a field is unstable.|$|E
30|$|A mapping Q: X→ X is {{partially}} compact if Q(C) is relatively compact on X for all <b>totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>sets</b> or chains C of X.|$|R

25|$|<b>Totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>sets</b> form a full {{subcategory}} of {{the category}} of partially <b>ordered</b> <b>sets,</b> with the morphisms being maps which respect the orders, i.e. maps f such that if a ≤ b then f(a) ≤ f(b).|$|R
25|$|A {{sequence}} is an ordered list. Like a set, it contains members (also called elements, or terms). Unlike a set, order matters, and {{exactly the same}} elements can appear multiple times at different positions in the sequence. Most precisely, a sequence {{can be defined as}} a function whose domain is a countable <b>totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>set,</b> such as the natural numbers.|$|E
25|$|In {{mathematical}} analysis, limit {{superior and}} limit inferior are important tools for studying sequences of real numbers. Since the supremum and infimum of an unbounded set of real numbers may not exist (the reals {{are not a}} complete lattice), it is convenient to consider sequences in the affinely extended real number system: we add {{the positive and negative}} infinities to the real line to give the complete <b>totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>set</b> , which is a complete lattice.|$|E

5000|$|The {{result is}} a partial order. If [...] and [...] are each <b>totally</b> <b>ordered,</b> then the {{result is a}} total order as well. The {{lexicographical}} <b>order</b> of two <b>totally</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>sets</b> is thus a linear extension of their product order.|$|R
