After a ghost attacks him in his sleep, Homer summons the ghosts, who are the family's former selves from The Tracey Ullman Show. Homer is attracted to the ghost Marge who prefers him to the former grumpy Homer, so the jealous living Marge kills herself to become a ghost. The ghost Homer becomes jealous and bludgeons the living Homer {{to death with a}} toaster while he is in the bathtub. Bart fakes suicide to join the ghosts, tricking Lisa into actually killing herself, her ghost then murders Bart as revenge. Groundskeeper Willie takes the children's corpses to make stew and it is implied that he murdered Maggie. Homer chooses his modern-day wife over the older ghost. The next morning at the breakfast table, Lisa asks if there could ever be any other incarnations of the Simpsons and a range of Simpson families based on other animations are then shown. The segment ends with the original version of Homer unsuccessfully trying to photograph a good portrait of the two families together.|$|E

25|$|Three feature-length Columbia {{releases}} {{were actually}} packages of older Columbia shorts. Columbia Laff Hour (introduced in 1956) was a random assortment {{that included the}} Stooges among other Columbia comedians like Andy Clyde, Hugh Herbert, and Vera Vague; the content and length varied from one theater to the next. Three Stooges Fun-o-Rama (introduced in 1959) was an all-Stooges show capitalizing on <b>their</b> <b>TV</b> fame, again with shorts chosen at random for individual theaters. The Three Stooges Follies (1974) was similar to Laff Hour, with a trio of Stooge comedies augmented by Buster Keaton and Vera Vague shorts, a Batman serial chapter, and a Kate Smith musical.|$|E

25|$|Task Review: First Forte {{built their}} {{campaign}} around comparing the music {{system to a}} larger, classical jukebox, even using the size {{differences between the two}} as part of it, with their overall presentation being viewed as impressive. Meanwhile, Impact suffered major issues throughout the task, as Paul spent less time managing the team and more on directing <b>their</b> <b>TV</b> advert, leaving Saira to give a very vague brief to a graphics designer on what was required from their print ad. Both adverts were deemed poor, with the TV advert hardly showing the product, while their sales pitch failed to improve things, as Sir Alan felt that First Forte's was clearly the better campaign.|$|E

25|$|Due to its {{position}} in a fold in the hill, TV and radio reception in Chesham can be poor and the town now has its own TV mast. In the 1970s, Chesham {{was one of the}} last towns in the south east to receive BBC2, and parts of it still cannot receive Channel 5. Houses taking <b>their</b> <b>TV</b> reception from the Chesham transmitter have vertically polarised aerials, whilst those in a good enough position receive their signal from the Crystal Palace Transmitter in London with horizontally polarised aerials– they always could receive BBC2 (and indeed Channel 4 & Channel 5). Digital terrestrial television coverage is patchy for much the same reason. Mobile phone reception can be poor in the steeper parts of Chesham and outlying villages.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} days, the pointed G logo was used on two other {{subsidiary}} businesses. Firstly came the 'Red Arrow Television Rental' chain. During {{the days when}} many families preferred to rent <b>their</b> <b>TV</b> sets to offset poor reliability and changing fashions, this company fared well alongside the established 'heavy hitters' such as Radio Rentals. The company's opening promotion was to give every new customer a small, Hiawatha-style figurine to stand {{on top of their}} new TV set. Upon its success, the name was later changed to 'Granada TV Rental'. Based on the results of this company, Granada Television dipped its toes into the office furniture rental business, and carpet sales and fitting for larger business customers, with 'Black Arrow'. This business was less successful.|$|E
