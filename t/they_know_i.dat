6000|$|... "I dare say, but that's my secret. My mamma {{and yours}} {{would be ready}} to kill me with rage if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> had let out even so much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you? They all {{say she is}} {{a perfect}} Charnock, though how <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> can't guess. There," [...] after a little more baby-worship, [...] "you may take her Emma." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{wish that}} I should bring them, for as <b>they</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> am of their blood, and I alone can talk their language, which my father taught {{me from a}} child." ...|$|E
6000|$|P.S. What's {{this about}} {{something}} in some newspaper?--I read least of all--from {{long and deep}} experience--what my friends write about me, and haven't read the things you mention. I suppose it's because <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> don't that they dare! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nothing. Nobody seemed {{curious about}} me. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> went to Plymouth, and I have stayed there a night {{now and then}} with Miss Bicknell. I rather {{calculated}} upon that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{had other}} things to think of,' said Alexis sadly, then recalling himself. 'Yes; Jones did sneer a little, but the others stopped that. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was down, you see.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>They</b> <b>know</b> well, Master, [...] That all I {{said was}} {{but to make}} them argue. [...] They've pushed me in to make a mock of me, [...] Because <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> could take either side [...] And beat them at it.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all talk, Andy. They couldn't get {{up such a}} party around here. Folks {{know better}} than to bother me. Besides, <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> am a good spender, and they like to help, not hinder, me," [...] and the ranch owner winked.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't; neither pistol nor knife. If any one shoots me, {{he shoots}} an unarmed man. The local bullies know it, {{and they have}} some scruple about {{shooting}} in that case. Besides, <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> am an awkward customer at close quarters." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{brother is}} right," [...] he answered. [...] "The pale-faces HAVE {{had time to}} get far down the stream. As my {{brothers}} know, I slept among them at the Round Prairie.

6000|$|... "I sail this night," [...] he said, [...] "when moon go down. That not far before midnight. You mus keep by boat here--close. If you go {{this way}} or that the niggers kill you.

6000|$|... "All {{my words}} are true," [...] said Dain, carelessly. [...] "If {{you want to}} know what befell my brig, then learn that it is in the hands of the Dutch.

6000|$|They say {{the very}} darkest clouds [...] Are lined with silver bright and fair, [...] Though how <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> do not see, [...] And neither do I really care.

6000|$|... "Yes, {{the man in}} this morning's 'Journal' has {{discovered}} three or four weeks--as it appears to take you here for everything--after my beginning to talk. Why, <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was talking that time ago on the other side." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I won't," [...] she said, {{turning back}} defiantly. [...] "I {{know what you}} are to say: that the Thrums people would be shocked if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was here; as if I cared what the Thrums people think of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's a fire, mother; {{the kind}} of knock is quite {{familiar}} to me now. Don't be alarmed; we hear {{that kind of thing}} about {{two or three times a}} day at the station; <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was here, and have sent a messenger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't allow as they will. About a {{year ago}} I gave thet Fetter fair warnin' if he showed his face about my cabin I'd plug him full o' holes, an' I sent Gilroy the same message. They know me, an' know I won't stand any nonsense. They'll be likely {{to give me a}} wide berth. <b>They</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> aint got much worth stealin'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some of the Spittal {{servants}} suspect it, nevertheless," [...] Babbie answered, [...] "though {{how much}} <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> cannot say. He has not a servant now, either here or in England, who knew me as a child. The gardener who befriended me was sent away long ago.

6000|$|The {{teamster}} said nothing, but a faint twinkle {{replaced the}} anger in his eye, when {{as they started}} again Miss Deringham glanced at him questioningly.

6000|$|... 'Heaven {{bless you}} for your goodness!' rejoined the girl. 'If you <b>knew</b> what <b>I</b> am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed. But I have stolen away from those who would surely murder me, if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> had been here, {{to tell you what}} I have overheard. Do you know a man named Monks?' ...|$|R
60|$|THE CLERK. <b>They</b> <b>knew</b> who <b>I</b> was. That's {{why they}} wouldn't let me up.|$|R

"I have a {{good many}} friends round about Washington," [...] Mr. Coulson continued, [...] "and sometimes, when <b>they</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> am coming across, {{one or the other}} of them finds it {{convenient}} to hand me a letter. It isn't the postage stamp that worries them," [...] he added with a little laugh, [...] "but they sort of feel that anything committed to me is fairly safe to reach its right destination." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you compel {{me to show}} YOU," [...] said Courtland immovably, [...] "what any Federal citizen may do in {{the defense}} of Federal law.

Some of you, who have already tried to assassinate him in cold blood, I have met before in less dishonorable warfare than this, and <b>THEY</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> am able to keep my word." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Slavin said, [...] "I guess I hear them, and I'll {{stay right}} where I am. They can't see me in the shadow, and if <b>they</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> was hanging round it might worry them.
