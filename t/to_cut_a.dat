5|$|An {{unfavorable}} mail line {{also had}} an early and lasting influence on {{the fortunes of the}} town. When the mail route was established in 1829, Randolph was put {{at the end of a}} branch route of the mail line and received mail only once a week. Failed railroad development further contributed to the demise of the town; and in 1852, residents of Randolph unsuccessfully tried to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph. Financial depression and David Crockett's failed attempt <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> canal from the Hatchie River to the Tennessee River also were problems that had a negative impact on the future of commercial prosperity in Randolph. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice, in September 1862 and again in 1865, discouraging many residents from re-building residences and businesses a second time.|$|E
5|$|Balls Mahoney faced Masato Tanaka in {{the second}} Extreme Rules match of the night. Mahoney got the early {{advantage}} after throwing a beer can {{in the face of}} Tanaka. Tanaka gained the advantage after executing a superplex off the top rope. Mahoney won the match after hitting Tanaka with a steel chair. Before the WWE Championship match, Eugene came to the ring <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> promo. He reminded the fans that he was Eric Bischoff's nephew, before being interrupted by The Sandman. Sandman hit Eugene repeatedly with his Singapore cane, leaving Eugene to run to the back, with The Sandman chasing after him.|$|E
5|$|Falkenberg and Næsheim {{held onto}} Bågenholm's skis {{as they waited}} for the rescue teams to arrive. At first Bågenholm {{struggled}} in the cold water before she found an air pocket and was able to remain conscious for 40minutes before becoming a victim of circulatory arrest. Ketil Singstad led the rescue team {{from the top of the}} mountain. He skied as fast as he could to Bågenholm's location, where he and his rescue team tried unsuccessfully to pull her out with a rope. They then tried to dig her out, but their snow shovel could not break through the ice. Rescuers from the bottom of the mountain then arrived, bringing with them a pointed gardening shovel. They were able <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> hole in the ice, and pulled her through at 19:40. Bågenholm had been in the water for 80minutes when she was rescued.|$|E

5|$|Lady Crane {{returns to}} her {{chambers}} to find a wounded Arya Stark hiding inside, and helps stitch her wounds. She tells Arya that thanks to her warning, she mutilated her would-be killer Bianca's face before kicking {{her out of the}} acting company. She then offers to have Arya join them, but she refuses, saying that she intends to travel west of Westeros to see the edge of the world. As Arya recovers, The Waif arrives and kills Lady Crane, intending to kill Arya as well. Arya flees through the streets of Braavos, but during the chase, Arya's wounds reopen and she limps back to her hideout with the Waif in close pursuit. As the Waif closes in, Arya uses Needle <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> candle, plunging the room into total darkness, where, having been trained while blinded for several weeks, Arya gains the upper hand.|$|E
5|$|The HV {{clashed with}} units subordinated to the 180th Motorised Brigade of the JNA {{in a pink}} zone near Zadar on 17–22 May. While the JNA {{repelled}} attacks in most areas around Zadar and Stankovci, the HV managed <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> JNA base at the Križ Hill away {{from the rest of}} the force on 17 May. The JNA outpost occupied high ground overlooking the surrounding area, including Zadar. It housed radar equipment and was used as an artillery observer post. The JNA attempted to relieve the besieged garrison in the next few days, however the attempts failed and the base surrendered to the HV on 22 May. The attack and capture of the Križ Hill, codenamed Operation Jaguar, was carried out by the 2nd Battalion of the 159th Infantry Brigade of the HV, supported by artillery of the 112th Infantry Brigade.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{draft of}} the film's script was written by Sho Aikawa at a hundred pages long, making the film over three hours long. Mizushima and others had <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> third of the script's scenes out {{in order to make}} the film an appropriate length. Some scenes and characters were removed from the final cut, including a character named Steiner who could see auras, having a role similar to Noah's. A scene which was cut involved characters Roy Mustang and Winry Rockbell meeting in front of the late Maes Hughes' grave. By October 2004, the script was completed and the pre-check storyboards were produced. The pre-check storyboards showed the movements of objects and characters in each shot along with the characters' lines. Production on the proper storyboards began in November of the same year, but the schedule in producing the film was immensely busy, so the directors of the film split the storyboards into six sections, one for each of the directors to create.|$|E

5|$|With the 11th Light Armoured Motor Battery and 1st Light Car Patrol attached, the 4th Cavalry Division watered at the 'Auja River {{before moving}} to the {{south-east}} of Jlil, close behind the infantry and the front line. From here, a divisional pioneer party reached the front line at 07:00 on 19 September <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> gap and flag a path through the Ottoman wire. By 08:40 permission was given by the 7th (Meerut) Division, which had attacked the western sector of the Tabsor defences, for the 4th Cavalry Division, accompanied by three horse artillery batteries which had rejoined the division after taking part in the bombardment and creeping barrage {{at the beginning of the}} Battle of Sharon, to pass through the gap in the Ottoman front line defences created by their attacks.|$|E
5|$|Noted songwriting duo Julia Houston (Debra Messing) and Tom Levitt (Christian Borle) get {{inspiration}} {{for a new}} Broadway show after Tom's personal assistant Ellis Tancharoen (Jaime Cepero) reveals his love for Marilyn Monroe. The two decide <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> demo with Broadway veteran Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) which Ellis videotapes. He sends the tape to his mother who uploads it online. Julia and Tom grow angry towards this, fearing that theater critic Michael Riedel will write a harsh review of the song. They decide to fire Ellis, until they learn Riedel loved the song and approved {{of the idea of}} a Marilyn Monroe musical. They rehire Ellis and they quickly receive interest from producer Eileen Rand (Anjelica Huston), who brings on director Derek Wills (Jack Davenport), who had a strained relationship with Tom. Derek demands to audition for the main role while Tom wants Ivy to play Marilyn. Meanwhile, a waitress named Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee), who came from a small town in Iowa to make her theatrical dreams a reality hears the original demo song and decides to audition. Karen makes a good impression on the producers, leading to both Karen and Ivy getting a callback. Later on, Derek calls Karen to have a meeting at his loft late at night.|$|E
5|$|On 25 July 1944, Lieutenant General Omar Bradley {{launched}} Operation Cobra {{against the}} German defences penning his First United States Army into its Normandy beachhead. Although intended only <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> corridor through to Brittany thereby freeing his {{forces of the}} constraints of operating in the bocage, the offensive precipitated a general collapse of the German position opposite the American sector when Generalfeldmarschall Günther von Kluge's Army Group B was slow to withdraw and expended many of its remaining combat-effective formations in futile counterattacks. With the German left flank in ruins the Americans began a headlong advance into Brittany, but a large concentration of German forces—including most of their armoured strength—remained opposite the British and Canadian sector. Sensing the opportunity to encircle these forces and inflict a decisive defeat and with Bradley's urging, the Allied ground forces commander General Bernard Montgomery sanctioned General George Patton's United States Third Army to swing north towards the town of Falaise. Its capture would cut off virtually all the remaining German forces in Normandy. While the Americans pressed in {{from the south and}} the British Second Army from the west, the task of completing the encirclement fell to the newly inaugurated First Canadian Army under General Harry Crerar. To accomplish this, Crerar and Lieutenant-General Guy Simonds, of IICanadian Corps, planned an Anglo-Canadian offensive code-named Operation Totalize. Intended to seize an area of high ground north of Falaise, by 9 August the offensive was in trouble despite initial gains on Verrières Ridge and near Cintheaux. Strong German defences and indecision and hesitation in the Canadian chain of command hampered Allied efforts, and the 4th Canadian and 1st Polish Armoured Divisions suffered heavy casualties. Anglo-Canadian forces reached Hill 195 north of Falaise on 10 August but were unable to make further progress, so Totalize was called off.|$|E

25|$|With {{large-scale}} projects like quilts, {{it is often}} advantageous to have a rotary cutter and mat. A rotary cutter is a cutting tool with a round blade, making it easy <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> smooth, continuous line. Rotary cutters come with different sized blades: a larger blade is useful for large projects with straight lines, while a smaller blade is helpful for small areas or curved lines. A rotary mat protects tables and surfaces from the blade, while also protecting the cutting edge from damage. A quilting ruler can also be used, to help ensure that all pieces are cut to consistent sizes. Quilting rulers are made of clear plastic and have marked grid-lines {{across the surface of}} the ruler. This type of ruler makes it possible <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>a</b> piece of fabric in the correct width or length without having to use a measuring tape and fabric chalk. Measurements have to include a seam allowance.|$|E
