25|$|The Maryland Department of Transportation, {{headquartered}} in the Hanover area of unincorporated Anne Arundel County, oversees most transportation {{in the state}} through its various administration-level agencies. The independent Maryland Transportation Authority, {{headquartered in}} Baltimore, maintains and operates the state's eight <b>toll</b> <b>facilities.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{parts of}} I-95 were {{made up of}} various toll roads {{that had already been}} {{constructed}} or planned, particularly in the northeast. Many of these routes still exist today, but some have removed their tolls. Outside of Florida, current I-95 <b>toll</b> <b>facilities</b> are compatible with the E-ZPass electronic payment system; in Florida, while I-95 can be driven toll-free, use of the '95 Express Managed Toll Lanes' requires a SunPass transponder.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Toll</b> <b>facilities</b> {{designated}} as Interstate highways (such as the Massachusetts Turnpike) were typically {{allowed to continue}} collecting tolls, but are generally ineligible to receive federal funds for maintenance and improvements. Some toll roads that did receive federal funds to finance emergency repairs (notably the Connecticut Turnpike (I-95) following the Mianus River Bridge collapse) were required to remove tolls {{as soon as the}} highway's construction bonds were paid off. [...] In addition, these <b>toll</b> <b>facilities</b> were grandfathered from Interstate Highway standards. A notable example is the western approach to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge in Philadelphia, where I-676 has a surface street section through a historic area.|$|E
2500|$|Policies on <b>toll</b> <b>facilities</b> and Interstate Highways {{have since}} changed. The Federal Highway Administration has allowed some states to collect tolls on {{existing}} Interstate Highways, while a recent extension of I-376 included {{a section of}} Pennsylvania Route60 that was tolled by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission before receiving Interstate designation. Also, newer <b>toll</b> <b>facilities</b> (like the tolled section of I-376, which {{was built in the}} early 1990s) must conform to Interstate standards. A new addition of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices in 2009 requires a black-on-yellow [...] "Toll" [...] sign to be placed above the Interstate trailblazer on Interstate Highways that collect tolls.|$|E
5000|$|The TRB {{was created}} by virtue of Presidential Decree (“P.D.”) No. 1112 or the Toll Operation Decree.

50|$|Every time {{a vehicle}} {{equipped}} with an OBU passes through a <b>tolling</b> <b>facility,</b> the OBU gives a single acoustic signal.
