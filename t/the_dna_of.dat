40|$|Iodinated Mason-Pfizer virus (MPV) 60 - 70 S RNA {{has been}} used in {{molecular}} hybridization experiments to determine the distribution of MPV-specific proviral sequences in <b>the</b> <b>DNAs</b> <b>of</b> primates. Approximately 20 % of the MPV genome is present as endogenous provirus in rhesus monkeys. Competitive hybridization experiments showed no homology between MPV 60 - 70 S RNA and the 60 - 70 S RNAs of M 7, RD- 114, and the simian sarcoma virus. No MPV-specific proviral sequences were detected in <b>the</b> <b>DNAs</b> <b>of</b> apparently normal tissues of various species of New World monkeys, apes, and humans. The part of the MPV genome that is endogenous to rhesus is also endogenous to the other species of Old World monkeys examined: baboon, African green, and patas. This was determined {{as a result of the}} following observations: (i) C 0 t 1 / 2 values and final extent of hybridization were the same for all four species. (ii) Tm values of MPV 60 - 70 S RNA and <b>DNA</b> <b>of</b> all four species were identical. (iii) The removal of MPV sequences endogenous to rhesus tissues by recycling against rhesus <b>DNA</b> resulted in <b>the</b> loss of any hybridizable MPV RNA to <b>the</b> <b>DNAs</b> <b>of</b> baboon, African green, and patas tissues.

5|$|The {{carcinogenity}} of chromate dust {{has been}} known for a long time, and in 1890 the first publication described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a chromate dye company.

The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the DNA.

Infrared spectra provided evidence for the types of structural changes involved. Normal ovarian DNAs formed a tight cluster comparable to that of normal human blood leukocytes. <b>The</b> <b>DNAs</b> <b>of</b> ovarian primary carcinomas, including those that had given rise to metastases, had a high degree <b>of</b> disorder, whereas <b>the</b> <b>DNAs</b> <b>of</b> distant metastases from ovarian carcinomas were relatively ordered.
