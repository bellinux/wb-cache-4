Lieutenant Field Marshal Peter Quasdanovich, who had remained in the region between Mannheim and Heidelberg, used a hastily enhanced abatis to establish a defensive line at <b>the</b> <b>sleepy</b> country village of Handschuhsheim, east of the city of Heidelberg. The French force of two divisions—about 12,000 men—outnumbered the 8,000 defenders, and the position seemed untenable.|$|E
5|$|A {{request by}} the state to dismiss the suit was denied in August 1966, and the case was {{eventually}} heard {{by the state}} Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state. In the meantime, the state built the easternmost mile (1.6km) of the new alignment, which was not affected by the lawsuit. On July7, 1967, the court ruled 6–1 in favor of <b>the</b> <b>Sleepy</b> Hollow Valley Committee. As a result, the western half of the new road was moved an additional mile to the north, bypassing North Tarrytown completely. The new alignment of NY117 was completed in November1970 and its former alignment along Bedford Road was redesignated as NY448.|$|E

5|$|After {{performing}} at Wave Aid, Silverchair reunited and by late 2005 began preparations {{for their next}} studio album, Young Modern. Johns had written about 50 songs during the hiatus for a possible solo album or other project but decided to use them for Silverchair. In 2006, after five weeks practice the group demoed tracks in the Hunter Region, and then recorded at Los Angeles' Seedy Underbelly Studios with Launay as producer. Parks again arranged orchestral tracks for the band – they travelled to Prague to record with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. The group also used Mac, Luke Steele (<b>The</b> <b>Sleepy</b> Jackson) and Julian Hamilton (The Presets, The Dissociatives) – Hamilton also co-wrote songs with Johns. Silverchair self-funded the album's production to ease the pressures faced previously when working with a record label.|$|E

5|$|As Harvey's {{interests}} {{shifted to}} the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended {{and the number of}} visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 <b>the</b> <b>Sleepy</b> Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.|$|E

The hills surrounding Mill Valley were rather steep—requiring a dependable means of transportation for them to become a vacation spot. Rail was the most logical means at the time, and Mount Tamalpais was the most attractive destination for such a line.|$|E

25|$|More than 5000 {{species of}} fish inhabit Australia's waterways; of these, 24% are endemic. However, because of the {{relative}} scarcity of freshwater waterways, Australia has only about 300 species of freshwater fish. Two families of freshwater fish have ancient origins: the arowana or bonytongues, and the Queensland lungfish. The Queensland lungfish is the most primitive of the lungfish, having evolved before Australia separated from Gondwana. One of the smallest freshwater fish, peculiar to the southwest of Western Australia, is the salamanderfish, which can survive desiccation in the dry season by burrowing into mud. Other families with a potentially Gondwanan origin include the Retropinnidae, Galaxiidae, Aplochitonidae and Percichthyidae. Apart from the ancient freshwater species, 70% of Australia's freshwater fish have affinities with tropical Indo-Pacific marine species that have adapted to freshwater. These species include freshwater lampreys, herrings, catfish, rainbowfish, and some 50 species of gudgeon, including <b>the</b> <b>sleepy</b> cod. Native freshwater game fish include the barramundi, Murray cod, and golden perch. Two species of endangered freshwater shark {{are found in the}} Northern Territory.|$|E

The former committee filed a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court to block the new roadway, and they were joined in their efforts by conservationist groups and the village of North Tarrytown. On June28, 1966, the case was heard by the court. Engineers with the New York State Department of Highways were accused of showing [...] "unprecedented pell-mell haste" [...] in working on a project with the Rockefellers before any injunctions could stop it.
