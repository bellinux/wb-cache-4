Type I photoinitiators based on acetophenone give rise to <b>the</b> least <b>yellowing.</b> <b>The</b> presence of amines, such as N-methyldiethanolamine, increases yellowing to a noticeable extent. Amino groups present in the initiator or the reactive diluent lead to marked <b>yellowing.</b> <b>The</b> chemistry responsible for <b>the</b> <b>yellowing</b> is explored...|$|R

5|$|Georgia Tech {{had another}} {{significant}} {{win over the}} Clemson Tigers on October 29, 2011 at Bobby Dodd Stadium. Clemson was ranked nationally No. 5 at the time, and the Tigers suffered their first defeat of the season {{at the hands of}} <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Jackets. Tevin Washington led <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Jackets to a 31–17 upset victory by rushing for 176 yards on 27 carries and a touchdown, which was the most rushing yards ever by a Georgia Tech quarterback. In addition, Clemson's offense was almost completely shutdown by Georgia Tech's defense in the first half, and the Tigers were plagued by turnovers, which contributed to the win for <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Jackets.|$|E

Smith stated he did not ask for clarification of the rule because of his low-profile status. NASCAR president Mike Helton stated that race officials had correctly awarded the penalty to Smith, and clarified that no driver would be allowed to advance their position by going below <b>the</b> <b>yellow</b> line at any time during a race. Similarities were also made between Smith's overtake, and Earnhardt's pass of Kenseth below <b>the</b> <b>yellow</b> line at Talladega at the 2003 Aaron's 499.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Yellow</b> Line was {{originally}} planned {{to follow a}} slightly different route in Virginia. The plan would have sent Yellow Line trains to Franconia–Springfield, with Blue Line trains serving Huntington. This was changed due to a shortage of rail cars {{at the time of}} the completion of the line to Huntington. Because fewer rail cars were required to operate Yellow Line service than would be required to run Blue Line service out to Huntington – due to <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Line's shorter route – the line designations were switched. From 1999 to 2008, <b>the</b> <b>Yellow</b> Line operated to Franconia–Springfield on July 4, as part of Metro's special service pattern on that day.|$|E

He soon discovers Wallace and Angela in a cave, and the two claim they were abducted by aliens, who covered up their disappearance with false skeletons. Later, Scully arrives at Mulder's apartment and he explains to Scully what happened. He shows her an alien that he captured at Brown Mountain. Scully, however, accepts his reasoning without question and Mulder begins to doubt his surroundings.

In three plays, Georgia Tech gained a first down, but two subsequent plays lost yardage before kicker Scott Blair came onto the field to attempt—and convert—a 48-yard field goal.
