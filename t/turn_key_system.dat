SPICE and CMMI are used to rate and improve {{existing}} system development processes. The V-Model-XT is a system development processes model. A project-specific system development process can be derived by tailoring so that the special requirements of the project are met. The V-Modell-XT does not include all needed tools to perform the required processes. RUP is a <b>turn</b> <b>key</b> <b>system</b> including a software development process model which can be tailored together with methods and tools required to perform projects. In the paper it is shown that the usage of a tailored development process of V-Model-XT or RUP {{is a very good}} base to be rated with capability level / maturity level 3 (established / defined) in SPICE and CMMI. In addition it has to be assured that not only the methods and tools are available and used, but also the principles addressing the doing of the involved persons are followed and rated in the appraisal process of SPICE / CMMI...|$|E
40|$|The ALBA pre-injector is a 100 MeV Linac {{provided}} by THALES Communications as a <b>turn</b> <b>key</b> <b>system.</b> The mechanical installation started in February 2008 and finished in April 2008. Also {{the installation of}} {{the first part of the}} Linac to Booster Transfer Line and the Linac Diagnostic Line was done simultaneously. The status of the ALBA Linac and Transfer line, the characterization of the Sub-harmonic pre-buncher and the description of the timing system are reported. LINAC SETUP The ALBA Linac consists of a 90 kV DC thermoionic gun, followed by a bunching system designed to reduce the energy spread and the electron losses. This one comprises a Sub-harmonic pre-buncher (500 MHz), a pre-buncher (3 GHz) and 22 -cells SW Buncher (3 GHz). Two travelling wave constant gradient accelerating sections increase the energy up to 100 MeV. Beam focusing is ensured by shielded solenoids up to the bunching system exit and a triplet of quadrupoles between the two accelerating structures [1]. The Linac will work in single bunch and multi bunch mode, top-up operation is foreseen from the beginning. In table 1 the nominal beam parameters at the Linac exit are summarized...|$|E
40|$|Multiple Single Emitter (MSE) modules allow highest {{power and}} highest {{brightness}} diode lasers based on standard broad area diodes. 12 single emitters, each rated at 11 W, are stacked in fast axis and with polarization multiplexing 200 W are achieved in a fully collimated beam with a beam quality of 7 mm*mrad in both axes. Volume Bragg Gratings (VBG) stabilize the wavelength and narrow the linewidth {{to less than}} 2 nm. Dichroic mirrors are used for dense wavelength multiplexing of 4 channels within 12 nm. 400 W are measured from a 0. 2 mm fiber, 0. 1 NA. Control and drive electronics are integrated into the 200 W platform and represent a basic building block {{for a variety of}} applications, such as a flexible <b>turn</b> <b>key</b> <b>system</b> comprising 12 MSE modules. An integrated beam switch directs the light in six 100 m, or in one 0. 2 mm and one 0. 1 mm fiber. 800 W are measured from the six 0. 1 mm fibers and 700 W from the 0. 2 mm fiber. The technologies can be transferred to other wavelengths t o include 793 nm and 1530 nm.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{has been}} {{transferring}} remote sensing technology {{to state and}} local government agencies through the Regional Applications Program since 1977. Typical participants in the program are new to both remote sensing and computer-aided analysis. Therefore, it is essential to introduce them to technology as simply as possible. Two approaches to this are: (i) special purpose minicomputer based (<b>turn</b> <b>key)</b> <b>systems,</b> and (ii) remotely accessed software on general purpose computers. The latter approach facilitates entry into the field with significantly lower costs. Most of the available software packages for analyzing remotely sensed data require familiarity with techniques, computers and some form of job control language. However, experience has shown that novices find the use of 2 ̆ 2 computer languages 2 ̆ 2 a distraction from the main learning goals. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe an effort to aid users through a conversational system. This system uses programs from the Office for Remote Sensing of Earth Resources (ORSER) software developed by the Pennsylvania state University. To facilitate communication with these programs, an interactive front-end, called ORSER Complete Conversational User-Language Translator (OCCULT) has been developed at GSFC. Through OCCULT, a user is prompted for all the data needed for submitting a program. The main features of OCCULT are: prompt-length control (depending on user 2 ̆ 7 s expertise); free-format user response; prompt-suppression by multiple- response; 2 ̆ 2 help 2 ̆ 2 messages to clarify prompts; a 2 ̆ 2 back-up 2 ̆ 2 command for error correction; display of data for review and editing prior to submission; a catalog to manage user 2 ̆ 7 s data and program set-ups; a print-out of the summary of activities during a session. In addition to the above, an easily updatable glossary of terms is maintained through which a user can get explanations for specific words. OCCULT is structured to permit easy addition of new analysis modules. OCCULT will be made available to trainees in the Regional Applications Program through a nationwide time-sharing network. It will also be available for purchase through COSMIC...|$|R
