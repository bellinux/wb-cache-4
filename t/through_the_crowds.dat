5|$|Corder {{was taken}} back to Suffolk where he was tried at Shire Hall, Bury St Edmunds. The trial started on 7 August 1828, having been put back several days because of the {{interest}} which the case had generated. The hotels in Bury St Edmunds began to fill up from as early as 21 July, and admittance to the court was by ticket {{only because of the}} large numbers who wanted to view the trial. Despite this, the judge and court officials still had to push their way bodily <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> that had gathered around the door.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{felt that}} their best chances lay in {{interviewing}} Christopher Addison about his contact with Booth; as Addison was a government minister he could be relied on to tell the truth. The case of Gruban v Booth opened on 7 May 1917 at the King's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in front of Mr Justice Coleridge. Patrick Hastings and Hubert Wallington represented Gruban, while Booth was represented by Rigby Swift KC and Douglas Hogg. The trial attracted such public interest that {{on the final day}} the barristers found it physically difficult to get <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> surrounding the Law Courts.|$|E

While both Rigby Smith and Douglas Hogg were highly respected barristers, Booth's cross-examination by Hastings was so skilfully done that the jury took only ten minutes to find that he had been fraudulent; they awarded Gruban £4,750 (about £ in 2015).|$|E

25|$|On the {{day before}} Ash Wednesday, festivities begin at 10 {{in the morning with}} music and dance as well as fireworks. These wind through the streets {{on their way to the}} main square. The party {{continues}} in the square with music and food and rides and other attractions. However, the real festivities begin at sundown and continue until the stroke of midnight of Wednesday. Throughout the day and night, Chinelos can be seen dancing <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds.</b> At its height, there are about 15,000 people crowded into the town center.|$|E
25|$|During Charlotte's {{lifetime}} {{friends and}} sponsors visited the parsonage, including Sir James and Lady Kay Shuttleworth, Ellen Nussey, Elizabeth Gaskell, John Store Smith, a young writer from Manchester, Bessie Parkes, who recounted her visit to Mrs. Gaskell, and Abraham Holroyd, poet, antiquarian, and historian. However, following {{the publication of}} the book and the pastor's public remonstrations, the parsonage became a place of pilgrimage for admirers wanting to see it with their own eyes. Charlotte's husband recalled that he had to protect his father-in-law, when on the short path to the church they had to push their way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> of people wanting to reach out and touch the cape of the father of the Brontë girls. The hundreds of visitors became thousands, coming from all over Britain and even from across the Atlantic. Whenever he agreed to meet them, Patrick received them with utmost courtesy and recounted the story of his brilliant daughters, never omitting to express his displeasure at the opinions held about Charlotte's husband.|$|E

500|$|As revenge, Wootton wrote a {{pamphlet}} titled Incidents in the Public Life of Robert Standish Sievier {{in which he}} claimed that Sievier had been expelled from the Victoria Racing Club, twice been declared bankrupt, cheated a man of £600 {{in a game of}} billiards and blackmailed another for £5,000. The pamphlet was released {{on the day of the}} Grand National and distributed widely <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds,</b> and in response Sievier sued Wootton for libel. Sievier appeared without a lawyer, while Wotton was represented by Sir Edward Carson KC, Hastings, and E. H. Spence. After the second day of the trial, Carson was called away to Ireland on political business, and Hastings was forced to act as the primary counsel for Wootton. [...] Hastings destroyed Sievier's reputation in cross-examination, and the jury decided in Wootton's favour.|$|E
500|$|Its imagery {{has been}} {{directly}} referenced in several works. The 2006 James Bond film, Casino Royale contains a small homage where James Bond pursues a female character through Venice, catching glimpses of her <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> {{wearing a red}} dress. The Bruges set thriller, In Bruges, starring Colin Farrell, includes a number of explicit references; director Martin McDonagh said that the [...] "Venice of Don't Look Now" [...] was the template for the depiction of Bruges in his film, and the film includes numerous thematic similarities, including one character stating that the film she is working on is a [...] "pastiche of Don't Look Now". Flatliners, a 1990 supernatural thriller directed by Joel Schumacher, also draws explicitly on the red-coated childlike figure by having a character terrorised by a child wearing a red coat; coincidentally, the character who is being tormented is played by Kiefer Sutherland, Donald Sutherland's son. [...] In the 2007 stage play of Don't Look Now, written by Nell Leyshon and directed by Lucy Bailey, the play made {{a conscious effort to}} bypass the film and be a faithful adaptation of du Maurier's short story, but it did however retain the iconic red mac from the film as worn by the elusive childlike figure.|$|E
500|$|As {{the crowds}} outside the stadium {{continued}} to grow, local police stations were mobilised, {{but by the}} time officers arrived the crowd was too large for them to take any effective form of action. At 2:15pm, the crowds outside the stadium rushed at the barriers and forced their way in. Spectators in the lower tiers had to climb the fences to escape the crush and overflowed onto the pitch itself. Spectator Terry Hickey said later that [...] "To put it mildly, the whole thing was a bloody shambles". The crowd was officially reported as 126,047, but estimates of the actual number of fans in attendance range from 150,000 to over 300,000. [...] The FA refunded 10% of the total gate money to fans who had pre-purchased tickets but were unable to reach their assigned seats. [...] The roads around the stadium were blocked and the Bolton players were forced to abandon their coach a mile from the stadium and make their way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds.</b> The Times stated that at one point it seemed impossible that the match would ever be able to start, but that when King George V arrived, the mood of the crowd changed. After enthusiastically singing [...] "God Save The King", the crowd began to assist the authorities in clearing the playing area.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} {{displays}} news anchor {{reports about the}} Earth on course {{to pass through the}} tail of a comet named Eurydice, as well as displaying a worldwide panic. The rest of the video then is presented {{through the use of a}} handheld video camera. Grande is in a Fiat car as the passenger, with her boyfriend (played by Matt Bennett), who is recording. They are stuck in traffic as they try to leave the city, implied to be Los Angeles, California. While everyone around them is panicking, Grande seems to be calm as she wants to get a closer look at the comet. Impatient, she leaves the car while Bennett tries to stop her, and then follows. They make their way <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds,</b> but are stopped by the police who are barricading the street. Meanwhile, the comet erupts in the sky and begins to crash to the ground as the song starts. Grande manages to get through but Bennett is unable to, so he goes through an open ambulance and manages to catch up with her in an alleyway with stairs leading up into an apartment complex. Ariana notices the comet in the sky. The two enter a home of a frightened family and try to leave through the other door, only for the comet to crash into the building, nearly killing both of them. Frightened, the two continue on and enter a room filled with television screens of the comet and an old man sitting at a desk. As the former two of them try to leave, the latter tries to stop them, but they knock him to the ground, and all the screens change to the same countdown timer. [...] Grande and Bennett eventually make their way up the rooftop after subduing the old man again, who had caught up with them. The camera is then set down, and shows the two of them embracing each other one last time until the comet crashes down, destroys everything and leads the Earth to an end.|$|E
2500|$|Irish {{government}} institutions and nationalist politicians {{called for an}} open and impartial inquiry. In the British House of Commons, Sir Hamar Greenwood, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, refused demands for such an inquiry. He denied that British forces had any involvement and accused the IRA of starting the fires. When asked about reports of firefighters being hampered by British forces he said [...] "Every available policeman and soldier in Cork was turned out at once and without their assistance the fire brigade could not have gone <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> and did the work that they tried to do".|$|E
2500|$|The {{testimony}} from American writer Eugene Bagger is quite unfavorable regarding {{the efficiency of}} the [...] "assembly line" [...] set up by Sousa Mendes. Bagger says that on the 18th he queued [...] for a couple of hours, at the Portuguese Consulate hoping to get a visa. Bagger says that the pushing and the elbowing drove him to despair and he gave up after a few hours. The next morning he joined again a mob of four hundred in front of the Portuguese Consulate. He waited in line from 9 a.m. till 11 o’clock, again to no avail and he finally quit. He then decided to have a drink at Hotel Splendid where he found Sousa Mendes having an aperitif with a friend. Sousa Mendes told Bagger that he was tired from overworking the previous day, from the crowds and from the heat. Then, at Bagger’s request, Sousa Mendes signed Bagger’s passport and told him {{to go back to the}} consulate to have it stamped. To Bagger’s surprise he was then helped by M. Skalski the Polish consul at Arcachon. At the Consulate M. Skalski was able to cut <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>crowds</b> and get Bagger’s passports duly stamped.|$|E
