[...] Woods soon discovers that Peter may not be who he says he is after learning that he lied about his hotel arrangements; Peter covers for this by admitting that he spent the night with his mistress. [...] Later, Neal tells Mozzie (Willie Garson) about Evan's silent attraction to Chloe, and that he plans to set them up using a sonnet.|$|E
500|$|During {{the spring}} and summer of 2014, several journalists {{observed}} that Frozen was unusually catchy in comparison to the vast majority of films, in that many children in both the U.S. and the UK were watching Frozen so many times that they now knew all the songs by heart and kept singing them again and again at every opportunity, to the distress of their hapless parents, teachers, and classmates. Among the celebrities who disclosed they were <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Frozen-obsessed child are former UK prime minister David Cameron, as well as actors Amy Adams, Ben Affleck, Kevin Costner and Vince Vaughn. When Terry Gross brought up this phenomenon with songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez in an April 2014 interview on NPR, they explained there was simply no way they could have known how popular their work on Frozen would become. They were [...] "just trying to tell a story that resonated" [...] and [...] "that didn't suck." ...|$|E
500|$|The cast of Twin Peaks did {{not know}} who would be {{revealed}} as Palmer's killer for some time. Wise had hoped his character Leland {{would not be the}} eventual murderer; as <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young girl he was disturbed by the idea of portraying a man who had murdered his daughter. Wise was called to a meeting with Lynch, Frost, Sheryl Lee and Richard Beymer, during which Lynch told those assembled that Leland Palmer was the killer: while addressing Wise, Lynch said [...] "Ray, it was you, it was always you". However, Wise felt that the end result was [...] "beautiful", and that it left him and his character [...] "satisfied and redeemed". Before this meeting, the only people to know the killer's identity were Frost, Lynch, and Lynch's daughter Jennifer, who had been given the information so she could author the 1990 tie-in novel The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer.|$|E

500|$|Tickets for the Best of Both Worlds Tour {{were selling}} out quite rapidly. Nevertheless, ticket {{scalping}} {{was one of}} the primary reasons for it. Many tickets were immediately found for purchase on secondary markets, such as eBay or StubHub, selling for well over the face value of the tickets. Broker prices ranged from $350 to $2,000 for the tickets originally sold for $29 to $66. The shortage of tickets for the tour became so pronounced it gained national attention, with parents frequently expressing their outrage, discontent, and disappointment on behalf of their children. Vice president of Ticketmaster, Joe Freeman commented, [...] "Hell hath no fury like <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> child throwing a tantrum. People who have been in this business for a long time are watching what's happening, and they say there hasn't been a demand of this level or intensity since The Beatles or Elvis [...]" [...] In an instance, a girl was unable to undergo a surgery she needed due to monetary issues, so she sold her tickets to a show of the tour for enough money to pay for the surgery. Debra Rathwell, senior vice president of AEG Live said the tickets were priced and sold as fairly as possible and assured there as no conspiracy between those who handled the tour and brokers. [...] "We do everything in our power to stop brokers from getting tickets, but it's impossible", she concluded. However, some brokers denied the allegations of purchasing most tickets for the shows. Brian Posey, owner of The Ticket Machine, an online broker based in East Lansing, Michigan, commented, [...] "I've never seen this as far as availability for any show. It's never been that hard to get tickets for us. You don't see seats anywhere. Parents shouldn't blame brokers for snapping up loads of tickets." [...] He continued to complain that the company was only able to purchase 28 tickets, while they usually averaged hundreds of tickets for hot tours.|$|E

2500|$|Phylogenetic {{classification}} traditionally {{relies on}} inheritance of the lexicon, especially of [...] "core" [...] terms, {{and of the}} grammar structure. However, in creoles, the core lexicon often has mixed origin, and the grammar is largely original. For these reasons, the issue of which language is <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> creole—that is, whether a language should be classified as a [...] "Portuguese creole" [...] or [...] "English creole", etc.—often has no definitive answer, and can become the topic of long-lasting controversies, where social prejudices and political considerations may interfere with scientific discussion.|$|E

A new version, featuring over 40 different children with albinism, was released in 2014. [...] The theme of the aforementioned The Albino Code (2007) is {{to point out the}} absurdity of typical depictions of albinistic people in Western media. [...] In 2009, two African American albinistic fashion models, Shaun Ross and Diandra Forrest, were the focus of an episode of the Tyra Banks Show, and revealed the traumas they experienced growing up albinistic, before finding unexpected success in front of the camera.|$|E

60|$|But lastly, to Boccaccio's {{sanction}} we must trace a {{large portion}} of the mythological pedantry and incongruous paganisms, which for so long a period deformed the poetry, even of the truest poets. To such an extravagance did Boccaccio himself carry this folly, that in a romance of chivalry, he has uniformly styled God the Father Jupiter, our Saviour Apollo, and the Evil Being Pluto. But for this there might be some excuse pleaded. I dare make none for the gross and disgusting licentiousness, the daring profaneness, which rendered the 'Decameron' of Boccaccio <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hundred worse children, fit to be classed among the enemies of the human race; which poisons 'Ariosto'--(for that I may not speak oftener than necessary of so odious a subject, I mention it here once for all)--which interposes a painful mixture in the humour of Chaucer, and which has once or twice seduced even our pure-minded Spenser into a grossness, as heterogeneous from the spirit of his great poem, as it was alien to the delicacy of his morals.|$|E
60|$|Great ideas opened {{themselves}} {{to his mind}} {{as he walked to}} and from his office daily. What if he could become <b>the</b> <b>parent</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> totally different order of things! What if the Civil Service, through his instrumentality, should become the nucleus of the best intellectual diligence in the country, instead of being a byword for sloth and ignorance! Mr. Hardlines meditated deeply on this, and, as he did so, it became observed on all sides that he was an altered man as regarded his solicitude for the Weights and Measures. One or two lads crept in, by no means conspicuous for their attainments in abstract science; young men, too, were observed to leave not much after four o'clock, without calling down on themselves Mr. Hardlines' usual sarcasm. Some said he was growing old, others that he was broken-hearted. But Mr. Hardlines was not old, nor broken in heart or body. He was thinking of higher things than the Weights and Measures, and at last he published a pamphlet.|$|E
