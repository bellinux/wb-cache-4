It enables a disabled person to move around independently using a <b>touch</b> <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> a voice recognition application which is interfaced with motors through microcontroller. When we {{want to change the}} direction, the touch screen sensor is modeled to direct the user to required destination using direction keys on the <b>screen</b> <b>and</b> that values are given to microcontroller. Depending on the direction selectedon the touch screen, microcontroller controls the wheel chair directions. This can also be controlled through simple voice commands using voice controller. The speech recognition system is easy to use programmable speech recognition circuit that is the system to be trained the words (or vocal utterances) the user wants the circuit to recognize. The speed controller works by varying the average voltage sent to the motor. This is done by switching the motors supply on and off very quickly using PWM technique. The methodology adopted is based on grouping a microcontroller with a speech recognition system <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> <b>screen...</b>|$|R
