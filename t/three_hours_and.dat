5|$|Both fleets were {{at first}} {{hampered}} by light and changeable winds. When a consistent west wind appeared on 20June, Hughes {{lined up for}} battle and awaited Suffren's action. Lining up in a similar formation, Suffren gave the order to attack, and battle began shortly after four in the afternoon. The action lasted around <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>and</b> resulted in no major damage to ships in either fleet, despite all ships being engaged. The British had 99 men killed and 434 wounded; French casualties amounted to 102 killed and 386 wounded.|$|E

As a result of the accident, in 1991 the United States Coast Guard suspended his masters' license for a period of nine months. Hazelwood was acquitted on all felony charges, but was convicted of a misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil, fined $50,000, and sentenced to 1,000 hours of community service.|$|E

The contest for the Mackay Trophy involved serial reconnaissance of troops maneuvering {{in the vicinity of}} San Diego and reports of their numbers and disposition. Accidents eliminated all machines but theirs and the trophy would not have been awarded that year if Fitzgerald had not provided a comprehensive and accurate report of the composition and location of the troops.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{defeated}} Murray in {{four sets}} in <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>and</b> 44 minutes, {{to capture a}} record equalling seventh Wimbledon championship, and a record breaking seventeenth Major title. The victory was also historic as it caused Federer to depose Djokovic as world No. 1 and break Sampras' record of 286 weeks at the summit of men's tennis (Federer had been just one week short when he lost the number one ranking in June 2010).

5|$|Linois {{had twice}} failed to capture, or even seriously engage, large and {{valuable}} British merchant convoys on his cruise. When he saw scattered sails {{in the distance}} at 03:00 on 13 March 1806, he decided to investigate in his ship of the line Marengo, {{in the hope that}} the ships would again prove to be a merchant convoy. By the time he realised that the approaching ships were actually a powerful naval squadron, he was too close to outrun the lead ship, Warren's flagship HMS London. As London engaged Marengo, the French frigate Belle Poule attempted to escape from the approaching squadron independently, but was also run down and brought to battle by the British frigate HMS Amazon. Both engagements lasted over <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>and</b> were bloody, the French ships surrendering after three and a half hours and losing nearly 70 men between them.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{took the}} first set on a {{tie-break}} {{just as he had}} done in the US Open final the previous year, and while the second set followed a similar pattern with no breaks of serve, this time Djokovic took the tie-break. One break of serve in the eighth game (two hours and 52 minutes into the contest) was enough for Djokovic to take the third set before taking the fourth 6–2 comfortably against a tired-looking Murray, who needed four hours to defeat Federer in the semifinal just two days before. The match lasted <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>and</b> 40 minutes and four sets. By winning Djokovic won his sixth Grand Slam tournament title to tie him with greats such as Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg, whereas Murray equalled Edberg's feat of three runner-up finishes at the Australian Open.|$|E
5|$|Nadal {{defeated}} Djokovic in {{four sets}} in <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>and</b> forty-three minutes, {{to win his}} first US Open title, and thus complete the Career Golden Slam (equalling the feat achieved by Andre Agassi). He also became the first Spaniard since Manuel Orantes in 1975 to win at Flushing Meadows, became the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win Major titles at the French Open, Wimbledon and US Open simultaneously and became only the second man after Laver to hold two Major titles on each surface (hard, clay and grass). The second set which Djokovic won was the only set Nadal lost in the entire championships. This would prove to become the main rivalry in tennis over the next 18 months.|$|E

Dream Theater promoted the album on a year-long world tour, with the majority of concerts lasting almost <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>and</b> featuring a different setlist each night.

5|$|A typical early 19th-century casual ward was {{a single}} large room {{furnished}} {{with some kind of}} bedding and perhaps a bucket {{in the middle of the}} floor for sanitation. The bedding on offer could be very basic: the Poor Law authorities in Richmond in the mid-1840s provided only straw and rags, although beds were available for the sick. In return for their night's accommodation vagrants might be expected to undertake a certain amount of work before leaving the next day, such as at Guisborough, where men were required to break stones for <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> <b>and</b> women to pick oakum, two hours before breakfast and one after. Until the passage of the Casual Poor Act 1882 vagrants could discharge themselves before 11 am on the day following their admission, but from 1883 onwards they were required to be detained until 9 am on the second day. Those who were admitted to the workhouse again within one month were required to be detained until the fourth day after their admission.|$|E
