5|$|Cooking {{onions and}} sweet onions are better stored at room temperature, optimally {{in a single}} layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. In this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>weeks</b> and sweet onions one to two weeks. Cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears.

5|$|Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt {{reduction}} of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (<b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>weeks),</b> may result in two groups of symptoms—rebound and withdrawal. Rebound symptoms are {{the return of the}} symptoms for which the patient was treated but worse than before. Withdrawal symptoms are the new symptoms that occur when the benzodiazepine is stopped. They are the main sign of physical dependence.|$|E

This also dashed Lee's hopes of becoming the first man to win three successive All England Open titles. In April, he was defeated by South Korean Shon Wan-ho in the final of the India Open, but retained his Malaysia Open Grand Prix Gold title for the fourth time in a row in May.

5|$|Macaroni {{penguins}} moult once a year, {{a process}} in which they replace all of their old feathers. They spend around two weeks accumulating fat before moulting because they do not feed during the moult, as they cannot enter the water to forage for food without feathers. The process typically takes <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>weeks,</b> which they spend sitting ashore. Once finished, they go back to sea and return to their colonies to mate in the spring. Overall survival rates are poorly known; the successful return of breeding adults at South Georgia Island varied between 49% and 78% over three years, and around 10% of those that did return did not breed the following year.|$|E
50|$|Arriving 13 August, {{the ship}} assumed {{her role as}} an ocean radar station ship, part of America's vast early warning defense system. Operating with search {{aircraft}}, Interdictor could detect, track, and report enemy aircraft at great distances, supplementing land-based radar stations, and controlling high-speed interceptor aircraft in case of attack. She also carried out weather reporting duties during her <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>week</b> cruises in the Pacific Ocean. Interdictor's hull classification was changed 28 September 1958 to AGR-13. She continued on radar picket patrols for the Continental Air Defense Command out of San Francisco until decommissioned 5 August 1965.|$|R

They feed on the needles of their host plant. They usually feed {{at the tip of}} the opening bud, webbing the bud cap to the tip. Old larvae enters a <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>week</b> non-feeding period in which they lose all markings and coloration.

5|$|The clutch is two {{to seven}} (normally five or six) cream-coloured eggs which have tiny ruddy, purple or blackish spots and are about 1.5centimetres (0.6in) long and 1.2centimetres (0.5in) across. They are {{incubated}} by the female for 13–14 days before hatching as naked, blind altricial chicks. The female broods and feeds the chicks for another 14–15 days until they fledge. The male rarely participates in feeding, although this sometimes occurs, especially when bad weather limits insect supplies {{or if the}} female disappears. After fledging, the young stay {{in the vicinity of}} the nest for <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>weeks,</b> and are fed by and roost with the female, although these interactions reduce after approximately the first 14 days. In the north of the range there is only time to raise one brood, due to the short summer, but a second brood is common in central and southern areas.|$|E
5|$|Despite McDonald's close involvement, the xx {{had been}} {{encouraged}} to self-produce their album by Russell; he believed it would remain faithful to both the band's distinctive live sound and the DIY ethic practiced at XL since its beginnings as a rave label. Smith was chosen {{by the rest of}} the group to produce xx. He used Logic 8 recording software on his Mac Pro and often worked late nights in a nearby conference room while they recorded in the studio with drafts of his beats. Smith produced rhythm tracks with an Akai MPC sampler, which he occasionally processed through a Roland RE-201 and other effects units. He also created click tracks for the rest of the band to keep timing when they recorded their individual parts. After those parts had been recorded, he refined and incorporated his beats into the songs for <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>weeks.</b> Croft trusted that Smith, who did not want to conceal any imperfections by overproducing xx, would make it practical for them to perform live rather than layer the songs with several guitar or vocal elements.|$|E
5|$|People with prolonged, frequent, {{or close}} contact with people with TB are at {{particularly}} high risk of becoming infected, with an estimated 22% infection rate. A person with active but untreated tuberculosis may infect 10–15 (or more) other people per year. Transmission should occur from only people with active TB – those with latent infection are not thought to be contagious. The probability of transmission {{from one person to}} another depends upon several factors, including the number of infectious droplets expelled by the carrier, the effectiveness of ventilation, the duration of exposure, the virulence of the M. tuberculosis strain, the level of immunity in the uninfected person, and others. The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active ("overt") TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens. After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others. If someone does become infected, it typically takes <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>weeks</b> before the newly infected person becomes infectious enough to transmit the disease to others.|$|E

5|$|The larvae {{float in}} the pelagic zone of the ocean with other {{plankton}} for <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>weeks,</b> during which {{a large number of}} them are eaten by predators. The larvae pass through three to five zoea stages before moulting into the post-larval glaucothoe stage; this process takes from 25 to 33 days. Upon reaching the glaucothoe stage of development, they settle to the bottom, find and wear a suitably sized gastropod shell, and migrate to the shoreline with other terrestrial hermit crabs. At that time, they sometimes visit dry land. Afterwards, they leave the ocean permanently and lose the ability to breathe in water. As with all hermit crabs, they change their shells as they grow. Young coconut crabs that cannot find a seashell of the right size often use broken coconut pieces. When they outgrow their shells, they develop a hardened abdomen. The coconut crab reaches sexual maturity around five years after hatching. They reach their maximum size only after 40 to 60 years.|$|E

Through literature, a child is able to learn about distant lands and time periods and may experience a multitude of adventures. Unfortunately, authentic children's {{literature is}} not used in the classroom often enough. To demonstrate how effectively and easily children's literature can be incorporated into the elementary curriculum, I have created an interdisciplinary unit to be used in a sixth grade classroom. I have chosen six books which each represent one major historical event in the American Twentieth Century. After reading each book I have written a <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>week</b> activity outline that will teach concepts associated with the events depicted in the book. This unit can be used alone as a whole, or it can be broken down into its individual books to be used in conjunction with an existing history unit.
