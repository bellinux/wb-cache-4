Ebert responded that [...] "nobody would say such a thing <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> white filmmakers: how could you do this to [...] "your people"?... Asian-American characters {{have the right to be}} whoever the hell they want to be. They do not have to represent 'their people'!" [...] He was a supporter of the film after the incident at Sundance, and also supported a number of Asian-American films, having them also screen at his film festival (such as [...] Eric Byler's Charlotte Sometimes).|$|E

500|$|This was a {{stressful}} time for Australian soldiers deployed to these checkpoints. The South Africans {{were determined to}} intimidate the UN forces, and SWAPO casualties occurred {{in the immediate vicinity}} of several checkpoints. The South Africans set up in force immediately adjacent to many checkpoints, pointed machine guns at the Australians and demanded that they hand over SWAPO soldiers who had surrendered. The Australian and British soldiers were outnumbered and out-gunned. Despite the fact that only nine SWAPO appeared at the points, the operation was a political success. Lieutenant Colonel Neil Donaldson, commander of the British contingent, said that [...] "the world press showed Australian and British soldiers standing up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> South African bullies". Crocker said that the fact that the Australian soldiers completed this operation without any casualties was a tribute to the [...] "training standards of the Australian Army and perhaps, a bit of good luck". The conclusion of Operation Piddock meant that the Australians were able to begin their engineering tasks.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "My First Kiss" [...] was filmed in New York City by director, Isaac Ravishankara. The song's music video is {{relative}} to the song's theme: kissing. Foreman explained, [...] " [...] the video is a play on kissing in general, and lips, and getting close up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> lips, and people coming out of mouths and just, like, really cool transitions." [...] The video follows a similar theme that is {{relative to the}} song's title, [...] "My First Kiss". It features {{a lot of people}} (punks, teachers, sailors, soldiers, lesbians, nerds, an elderly couple and hirsute rockers) [...] "smooching, kissing, and making out." [...] The video is made up of different scenes all using multi-colored backdrops as the video's dominant backing. The main scenes present are of [...] "3OH!3 bouncing around and throw punches at the camera" [...] while singing their versus and occasional close-ups of different pairs of lips that are mouthing different lyrics of the song. Kesha is also present throughout the video, mainly on her verses where she is seen in close-ups of her lips and dancing around the screen on the chorus.|$|E
500|$|A notable {{minority}} of Patton's officers were unimpressed or displeased with their commander's use of obscenities, viewing it as unprofessional conduct {{for a military}} officer. Among some officers' later recounting of the speech, bullshit would be replaced by baloney and fucking by fornicating. At least one account replaced [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the balls" [...] with [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the nose." [...] Among the critics of Patton's frequent use of vulgarities was General Omar Bradley, Patton's former subordinate. It was well known {{that the two men}} were polar opposites in personality, and there is considerable evidence that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally. In response to criticisms of his coarse language, Patton wrote to a family member, [...] "When I want my men to remember something important, to really make it stick, I give it to them double dirty. It may not sound nice <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> little old ladies, at an afternoon tea party, but it helps my soldiers to remember. You can't run an army without profanity, {{and it has to be}} eloquent profanity. An army without profanity couldn't fight its way out of a piss-soaked paper bag." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote that [...] "Timothy Dalton was everything {{we had come}} to expect from him in the part: scary and dangerous and then so much the funnier for the way he kept trying to work the steps and turn over a new leaf. The episode left 's sincerity up in the air for most of the hour - was he really serious about making amends, or just trying to distract Chuck from his latest evil plan? - but Volkoff is such a well-drawn character, and Dalton so talented and versatile, that the comedy worked either way... Vivian, on the other hand? I'd been iffy on her in her most recent appearance, and putting her on camera with , even briefly, was just a reminder of how much less she brings to the table." [...] Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A-. Though he praised Dalton's performance, McGee wrote, [...] "The direct parallels between Chuck and Vivian haven't really panned out in the way the show initially envisioned it. Let's face it: These two aren't exactly Buffy and Faith in terms of being foils for one another. The show has never painted Chuck as ever potentially going to the dark side. It has used Casey and occasionally Sarah to serve that function at times, but never Chuck. At this point, he's as set in his moral code as possible. Had the Vivian storyline happened at the outset of his Intersect 2.0 days, perhaps the taste of power could have gone to his head, with Vivian {{as an example of the}} road not taken. As such, Vivian's existence largely serves to connect her to the larger spy world of the show, not draw a direct parallel to the support system that helped Chuck overcome any potential temptations." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8 out of 10, writing, [...] "This Chuck got off to a shaky start. I don't know how to put my finger on it exactly, but the pacing felt off in the first third or so of the episode... Thankfully, things picked up considerably as the episode went along – I'd say the turning point was the scene in which Chuck was sent in to meet with the pirates. The way Chuck's big announcement that he worked for Alexei Volkoff immediately led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> guns pulled on him was funny, as was not only Chuck asking to play Uno (for his life), but that the pirate did indeed have the game." [...] Carl Cortez of Assignment X, however, gave the episode a negative review, calling it [...] "a painfully nonsense driven episode that's now grasping at straws in an attempt to round out the last part of the season with an adequate storyline." ...|$|E
