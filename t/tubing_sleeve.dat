Their impact on the potentially resistant species, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner), is considered integral to the Insect Resistance Management (IRM) strategy for transgenic cotton production in the ORIA. This thesis examines aspects of Trichogramma ecology pertinent to this strategy. The dominant species of egg parasitoid in ORIA cotton crops is the introduced Trichogramma pretiosum Riley. Other species make up {{less than one percent of}} collected specimens. Surveys revealed T. pretiosum has been introduced or adventitiously dispersed to all developed agricultural regions of northern Australia. Several new species were discovered during surveys in more pristine habitats. Based on field collected eggs, T. pretiosum appears to prefer H. armigera over H. punctigera Wallengren as a host in ORIA cotton. Measured as percent parasitism, Trichogramma activity appears highly variable and does not necessarily coincide with periods of peak insect pest density. Host abundance alone does not define conditions suitable for Trichogramma activity. Environmental constraints on wasp survival, such as the impact of temperature, humidity and insecticide applications, limit their effectiveness in biological control. Despite consistently high rates of percentage egg parasitism (60 - 99 %), acceptable pest control is not readily achieved in ORIA cotton without the aid of insecticides as Helicoverpa numbers exceed damage thresholds. Insecticides inhibit Trichogramma considerably, hence the conundrum regarding initiation of insecticidal control. Trichogramma activity is relatively high early season (May to July), significantly limiting the buildup of pests. Trichogramma effectively stifle Helicoverpa population increase following initial pest egg lay at least during high density years. The impact of farming practices, especially insecticide applications, should be avoided early season to ensure pest mortality attributed to Trichogramma egg parasitisation is maximised. Pre-season habitat manipulation to establish large populations of Trichogramma in alternative hosts is advised. Despite being rare in surrounding habitats and suffering near 50 % immature mortality in the field, Trichogramma effectively disperse into young crops attractive to ovipositing hosts and display a high intrinsic rate of increase. Spatial patterns of parasitism tend toward heterogeneity and do not necessarily coincide with host spatio-temporal dynamics. Both host abundance patterns and mean rates of parasitism are not good indicators of parasitoid patchiness. Parasitism rates are highest within the middle strata of the plant canopy prior to complete canopy closure despite a similar number of host eggs being available elsewhere in the plant. Pest density declines as the season progresses. However, insecticide applications become necessary if Bt expression in cotton plants wanes and larval damage increases. Measuring parasitism during periods of declining and low host density is prone to inaccuracy due to small sample size, but can be overcome with the use of egg cards. A better indication of parasitoid activity is achieved using egg cards during periods when insecticide applications are possibly required. As Trichogramma are most active in ORIA cotton from morning to early afternoon, insecticide applications if needed should occur outside of these periods. Trichogramma survival is constrained by environmental influences. Adult female T. pretiosum were exposed to ambient conditions in dialysis <b>tubing</b> <b>sleeve</b> cages to test survival and fecundity in cotton fields. Peak survival and fecundity occurs mid season with both life history variants displaying an inverse relationship to temperature. Adult female T. pretiosum survive longest in the field when provided with sustenance however mortality attributed to handling was considerable. Sleeve cages are not effective for survival measurement of small parasitoids if the cages are frequently moved. Trichogramma effectively reduce pest abundance but are clearly hindered by insecticides and hot dry conditions in ORIA cotton crops. The decision to initiate insecticide applications is best delayed unless absolutely necessary to avoid disruption of Trichogramma impact on pests. Parasitoid activity must be carefully monitored if chemical control becomes imminent. The impact of Trichogramma on pest species can then be optimally exploited...|$|E

This device is constituted of fused silica capillaries associated with adjusted <b>tubing</b> <b>sleeves</b> and T-junctions. Studying the effect of several experimental parameters, double emulsions containing a controlled number of droplets were fabricated. First, this study examines the stability of a jet in a simple confined microfluidic system, probing the conditions required for droplets production. Then, multicompartmental polymersomes were formed, controlling flow velocities. In this work, poly(dimethylsiloxane) -graft-poly(ethylene oxide) (PDMS-g-PEO) and poly(butadiene) -block-poly(ethyleneoxide) (PBut-b-PEO) amphiphilic copolymers were used and dissolved in chloroform/cyclohexane mixture. The ratio of these two solvents was adjusted in order to stabilize the double emulsion formation. The aqueous suspension contained poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), limiting the coalescence of the droplets. This work constitutes major progress in, the control of double emulsion formation in microfluidic devices and shows that complex structures can be obtained using such a process...|$|R

The separation tool allows flow to enter from the annulus and produce up the tubing. The tool blanks off the <b>tubing</b> below the <b>sleeve</b> to isolate the lower zone.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two main}} {{categories}} of sliding sleeves: open/close and choking. Open/close sleeves are shifted between a full open position and a closed position. They are used to shut off flow from a zone for economic reasons or to shut off a zone that is depleting or producing too much water. In multi-zone wells, {{they are used to}} regulate which zones to produce from and which ones to shut off. Mechanically actuated sleeves are simple and inexpensive but require actuation by a [...] "lock," [...] which must be run in the well on wireline or coiled <b>tubing.</b> Hydraulically actuated <b>sleeves</b> are more complicated but can be actuated from a small pump at surface. King sleeves can be used to regulate the pressure between two or more zones. They are also used to regulate the flow of fluid into a well during proppant fracturing or hydraulic fracturing operations. Choking sleeves are all hydraulically actuated and have a much more complex design than open/close sleeves.|$|R
50|$|JIC fittings, {{defined by}} the SAE J514 and MIL-F-18866 standards, are a type of flare fitting {{machined}} with a 37-degree flare seating surface. JIC (Joint Industry Council) fittings are widely used in fuel delivery and fluid power applications, especially where high pressure (up to 10,000 psi) is involved. The SAE J514 standard replaces the MS16142 military specification, although some tooling is still listed under MS16142. JIC fittings are dimensionally identical to AN (Army-Navy) fittings, but are produced to less exacting tolerances and are generally less costly. SAE 45-degree flare fittings are similar in appearance, but are not interchangeable, though dash sizes 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 14, and 16 share the same thread size. Some couplings may have dual machined seats for both 37-degree and 45-degree flare seats.Komatsu and JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) fittings have flare ends similar to JIC fittings. Komatsu and JIS both use a 30-degree flare seating surface. The only difference is Komatsu uses milimeter thread sizes while JIS use a BSP (British Standard Pipe) thread. JIC fitting systems have three components that make a tubing assembly: fitting, flare nut, and sleeve. As with other flared connection systems, the seal is achieved through metal-to-metal contact between the finished surface of the fitting nose and the inside diameter of the flared <b>tubing.</b> The <b>sleeve</b> is used to evenly distribute the compressive forces of the flare nut to the flared end of the tube. Materials commonly used to fabricate JIC fittings include forged carbon steel, forged stainless steel, forged brass, machined brass, Monel and nickel-copper alloys.|$|R
