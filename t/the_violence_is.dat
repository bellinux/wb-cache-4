5|$|However, the Jain {{conception}} of ahimsa {{is quite different}} from what is commonly understood by violence. <b>The</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> defined more by the motives and the consequences to the self rather than by the act itself. Furthermore, according to Jain Scriptures, destruction of less developed organism brings about lesser karmas than destruction of developed animals and karmas generated in observance of religious duties faultlessly disappears almost immediately. Hence, it is possible to observe complete nonviolence with right knowledge, even when some outward violence occurs to living beings in the course of performing religious duties by observing carefulness and pure mental disposition without any attachment.|$|E

Players {{control the}} actions of teenagers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold; the pair entered Colorado's Columbine High School on April 20, 1999 and killed 13 people before turning their guns on themselves in a library. Much of the game {{takes place in a}} third-person view, with players controlling Harris and Klebold from an overhead perspective. The graphics and characters are deliberately reminiscent of a 16-bit-era video game; while the content is violent, <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> not graphically rendered.|$|E

Hagrid asks the three of them to look after Grawp if he himself must leave the school. Sure enough, Umbridge leads a party of Aurors to attack Hagrid in his house one night.

25|$|The city’s and municipality’s {{recent history}} has {{centered}} on violence related to drugs and the environment. Drug-related violence of {{the past several decades}} has taken its toll as tourism is down, fewer come to shop in the city and many residents stay indoors for fear of a stray bullet. The violence and threats of violence have left streets empty after 7 pm. Pickups and SUVs with darkened windows are a common sight. These vehicles are associated with the many shootings and even grenade attacks that have taken place in and around the city in recent years. <b>The</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> not limited to the city of Petatlán; it also occurs in its small rural communities such as La Morena, El Camalote and Las Humedades. A number of these have been partly or fully abandoned as drug-related violence grows. <b>The</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> among local drug lords over turf.|$|E

25|$|The {{causes of}} this {{violence}} against Muslims are varied. The roots {{are thought to}} lie in India's history– resentment toward the Islamic domination of India during the Middle Ages, policies established by the country's British colonizers, and the violent partition of India into a Muslim-majority Pakistan and a secular India with a Muslim minority. Many scholars believe that incidents of anti-Muslim violence are politically motivated {{and a part of}} the electoral strategy of mainstream political parties who are associated with Hindu nationalism like the Bharatiya Janata Party. Other scholars believe that <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> not widespread but that it is restricted to certain urban areas because of local socio-political conditions.|$|E

25|$|As {{with the}} first film, Gremlins 2 is a live action horror comedy film; however, Dante put effort into taking the sequel in new anarchic directions. The film {{is meant to be}} more cartoon-like and less dark than the original, and <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> fairly slapstick. There are also a number of parodies of other films and stories, most notably Gremlins itself, as well as the Rambo films, The Wizard of Oz, Marathon Man and The Phantom of the Opera. As {{with the first}} film, {{critical}} response varied. Some critics who thought the first film was too dark gave Gremlins 2 better reviews, but it received a colder reception from fans who thought otherwise.|$|E

25|$|While the Arundel affinity's {{dominance}} {{was generally}} imposed through adept {{use of the}} law and civil authority, there was an undertow of violence and intimidation and this became increasingly open and notorious after 1410, as Arundel's affinity clashed with supporters of most of the county's other magnates. Burley was very close to the perpetrators of violence: his son, his former ward and his future executors were involved {{in some of the most}} sensational outrages. These led to complaints about the prevalence of bad governance and murder in Shropshire at the Fire and Faggot Parliament, held in Leicester in 1414. Many cases came to court at the last ever regional session of the Court of King's Bench, held at Shrewsbury in Trinity term of 1414. Henry V was present in person, along with William Hankford, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench, to make a show of taking seriously the complaints against his most powerful supporter in the region, and much of what is known of <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> derived from allegations made at that court.|$|E

500|$|The graphic {{depiction}} {{of violence in}} The Last of Us generated substantial commentary from critics. Engadget writer Ben Gilbert found the game's persistent focus on combat was [...] "a necessary evil to lead the game's fragile protagonist duo to safety", {{as opposed to being}} used as a method to achieve objectives. Kotakus Kirk Hamilton wrote that the violence was [...] "heavy, consequential and necessary", as opposed to gratuitous. USGamer's Anthony John Agnello wrote that the game consistently reinforces the negativity associated with violence, intentionally making players feel uncomfortable while in violent combat. He stated that the deaths within the game were not unnecessary or unjustified, making the story more powerful. Kelly of Computer and Video Games stated that, despite the [...] "incredibly brutal" [...] combat, the violence never felt gratuitous. Eurogamers Welsh echoed similar remarks, stating that <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> not [...] "desensitized or mindless". Matt Helgeson of Game Informer observed that the game's violence leads to players questioning the morality of their choices. Joystiq's Mitchell wrote that <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> [...] "designed to be uncomfortable", stating that it contributes to Joel's character. Prior to the release of the game, Keith Stuart of The Guardian wrote that the acceptability of the violence would depend on its context within the game.|$|E
500|$|Prior to its {{theatrical}} release, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) certified {{the film}} with a UA certificate after demanding a few cuts, {{due to a}} high proportion of violence present in the film. Explaining the certificate, Pankaja Thakur, CEO of CBFC stated, [...] " [...] Agneepath has a lot of bloodshed but none of us felt disturbed by it. <b>The</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> not the type that can psychologically damage a child and the softer scenes of the film managed to offset the darker part of it". The film's posters subsequently featured disclaimers reading, [...] "This film is certified U/A. We advise parental guidance due to violence in the film." [...] The board, consequently praised Johar for the step.|$|E

500|$|The Director's Cut was {{described}} by Noyce as [...] "my own personal take on the material, free from the politics and restrictions of producers, studio or censorship ratings". Four minutes of film are added, leading to a running time of 104 minutes. More flashbacks are added, and <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> amped up – for example Mike being drowned rather than shot to death. The ending is also different: in the bunker scene, Winter shoots the President instead of only knocking him unconscious, and a media report during the final scene reports that the new US president had been orphaned on a family visit to Russia, implying {{he is also a}} sleeper agent. Noyce has described this ending as [...] "an ending yet just a beginning – and it's an ending that turns the whole story on its head".|$|E
500|$|The {{makers of}} the film were {{disappointed}} by the Censor Board for Film Certification's decision to grant the film an [...] "A" [...] certificatemeant for viewers 18 years or olderinstead of a [...] "U/A" [...] certificate that they had expected. Bhardwaj said, [...] "It was injustice to us. There is no abusive language used in the film and <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> of 'comic book kind'." [...] The Censor Board asked him to replace dialogue which mentioned the city of Pilibhitwhich they said was a sensitive constituencywith a fictitious city name. He replaced Pilibhit with Barabanki." [...] The film was subject to some controversies. A First Information Report was filed by Jagannath Sena Sangathan at a police station in Puri against the film for allegedly denigrating Lord Jagannath. According to them, {{a scene in which}} the text [...] "Apna Hath Jagannath" [...] is seen in a toilet on a semi-clad model had hurt religious sentiments. The objectionable portion of the scene was removed from the prints released in the state of Orissa. A complaint supported by a caste group backed by a Samajwadi Party MP about the use of the name of a community [...] "teli" [...] in the song [...] "Dhan Te Nan"which was considered derogatory to the Teli communitywas filed with the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The Censor Board reacted to the complaint, insisting on the replacement of the word, which was later replaced with [...] "Dilli".|$|E
500|$|Thunderball was {{generally}} well {{received by the}} critics; Francis Iles, writing in The Guardian wrote that it [...] "is a good, tough, straightforward thriller on perfectly conventional lines." [...] Referring to the negative publicity that surrounded Dr. No—in particular the article by Paul Johnson in the New Statesman entitled, [...] "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism"—Iles was left [...] "wondering {{what all the fuss}} is about", noting that [...] "there is no more sadism nor sex than is expected of the author of this kind of thriller". Peter Duval Smith, writing in Financial Times, also took the opportunity to defend Fleming's work against negative criticism, also specifically naming Paul Johnson and his review: [...] "one should not make a cult of Fleming's novels: a day-dream is a day-dream; but nor should one make the mistake of supposing he does not know what he is doing." [...] Duval Smith thought that Thunderball was [...] "an exciting story is skilfully told", with [...] "a romantic sub-plot... and the denouement involves great events" [...] He also considered it [...] "the best written since Diamonds Are Forever, four books back. It has pace and humour and style. <b>The</b> <b>violence</b> <b>is</b> not so unrelenting as usual: an improvement, I think." [...] He also expressed concern for the central character, saying [...] "I was glad to see him [...] in such good form. Earlier he seemed to be softening up. He was having bad hangovers on half-a-bottle of whisky a day, which I don't call a lot, unless he wasn't eating properly." ...|$|E

They say that the loyalists tried to set the church alight and invade Short Strand, {{with the intention of}} burning the residents from their homes. Hence, republicans argue that they were defending the Short Strand from loyalist attack. Loyalists claim <b>the</b> <b>violence</b> <b>was</b> begun by republicans; allegedly when the returning Orangemen and supporters were attacked on Newtownards Road. They argue that republicans attacked Protestants to lure them into [...] "a carefully prepared trap".|$|R
