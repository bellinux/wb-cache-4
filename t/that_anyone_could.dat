5|$|Eager {{to promote}} and defend her religion, she {{played a leading role}} in both the Witchcraft Research Association and then the Pagan Front during the 1960s and 1970s. That latter decade also saw her briefly involve herself in far right {{politics}} as well as becoming a keen ley hunter and proponent of Earth mysteries. As well as regularly writing articles on esoteric topics for various magazines, from the 1960s onward she authored a number of books on the subject of Wicca, as well as contributing to the publication of works by Wiccan friends Stewart Farrar, Janet Farrar, and Evan John Jones. In these works also she became an early advocate of the idea <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> practice Wicca without requiring initiation by a pre-existing Wiccan, while also contributing to and encouraging research into the religion's early history. Living in Brighton during these years, she worked with both her partner and initiate Ron Cook and {{was a member of the}} Silver Malkin coven. In her final years she served as patron of the Sussex-based Centre for Pagan Studies prior to her death from pancreatic cancer.|$|E
25|$|Peter Masefield, in {{his review}} of caste {{situation}} in India states <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> in principle perform any profession. The texts state that the Brahmin took food from anyone, suggesting that strictures of commensality were as yet unknown. The Nikaya texts also imply that endogamy was not mandated.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, in 1973, Raymond Buckland, who {{had brought}} the Gardnerian craft to the USA originally, ceased to practice it, and formed a new tradition, known as Seax-Wica. Seax used the structure of traditional Gardnerian covens, but used the iconography of Anglo-Saxon paganism, so the God and the Goddess were represented not as the traditional Horned God and Mother Goddess, but as Woden and Freya. Seax was virtually unique amongst Wicca {{at the time as}} it did not work on an initiatory basis of covens; Buckland deliberately published all its rites and rituals in a book, The Tree, so <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> practice them.|$|E

60|$|Dorothy decided <b>that</b> if <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> {{help her}} {{it would be}} Glinda the Good, the {{wonderful}} Sorceress of Oz who was Ozma's faithful subject and friend. But Glinda's castle was in the Quadling Country and quite a journey from the Emerald City.|$|R
50|$|As {{a promotional}} campaign, Mr. Spain advertised <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> who <b>could</b> pick his new lock would receive $50,000. Many tried and failed, {{except for one}} detective from New York City, {{who was able to}} pick the lock once but not twice.|$|R
25|$|Diamond Head {{have cited}} their early inspirations as classic 70s British rock bands such as Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, UFO, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest and Free, Brian Tatler {{relating}} {{that the first}} albums he bought were Led Zeppelin's second album and Deep Purple's Machine Head, and said that although {{a lot of his}} guitar work was inspired by Ritchie Blackmore and Michael Schenker it was punk rock that showed him <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> form a band. Colin Kimberley commented Diamond Head got their complex sound from listening to bands like Black Sabbath and Rush and realising that a song with a single riff throughout was not interesting enough.|$|E
25|$|The {{necessity}} and inerrancy were well-established ideas, garnering little criticism, though they later came under debate from outside during the Enlightenment. The most contentious {{idea at the}} time though was the notion <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> simply pick up the Bible and learn enough to gain salvation. Though the reformers were concerned with ecclesiology (the doctrine of how the church as a body works), they had a different understanding of the process in which truths in scripture were applied to life of believers, compared to the Catholics' idea that certain people within the church, or ideas that were old enough, had a special status in giving understanding of the text.|$|E
25|$|The {{technological}} innovations of the 19th century {{had opened the}} possibility of rapid circumnavigation and the prospect fascinated Verne and his readership. In particular, three technological breakthroughs occurred in 1869–70 that made a tourist-like around-the-world journey possible for the first time: {{the completion of the}} First Transcontinental Railroad in America (1869), the linking of the Indian railways across the sub-continent (1870), and the opening of the Suez Canal (1869). It was another notable mark in the end of an age of exploration and the start of an age of fully global tourism that could be enjoyed in relative comfort and safety. It sparked the imagination <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> sit down, draw up a schedule, buy tickets and travel around the world, a feat previously reserved for only the most heroic and hardy of adventurers.|$|E

Khalil Musa reportedly knew president Álvaro Colom, an advisor of whom told an American journalist that, “if the Musas could be killed, {{there was a sense}} <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> Guatemala <b>could</b> be.” ...|$|R
25|$|The pitch {{itself had}} become slower and slower. Some {{observers}} {{said that it}} was useless to bowlers and batsmen alike. That wasn't true, because some of the batsmen showed beyond all doubt <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> who <b>could</b> really hit the ball could play it away with ease, power, and safety as it rose slowly from the turf.|$|R
25|$|The Ninth Session {{was held}} on Friday, 17 May, at which it was decreed <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> leave the Obedience of Gregory or the Obedience of Benedict without penalty, but that those who {{positively}} refused to leave would be permanently punished. The Tenth Session took place on Tuesday 22 May, at which a petition was presented to send an embassay to Genoa to engage in negotiations. The two contending parties, Benedict and Gregory, were summoned once again at {{the doors of the}} Cathedral by two cardinals. A petition was presented to certify that the two cardinals had carried out the summons. A Notary began to read the articles which were being proffered against the two popes, first in general terms and then in detail, citing witnesses and documents. These were produced by the Bishop of Pisa, Alamanno Adimari. Twenty articles were read and accepted before the time for the day's sitting elapsed. The reading and the presentation of witnesses and proofs continued at the Eleventh Session on 23 May.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} American iconoscope was noisy, {{had a high}} {{ratio of}} interference to signal, and ultimately gave disappointing results, especially {{when compared to the}} high definition mechanical scanning systems then becoming available. The EMI team under the supervision of Isaac Shoenberg analyzed how the iconoscope (or Emitron) produces an electronic signal and concluded that its real efficiency was only about 5% of the theoretical maximum. They solved this problem by developing and patenting in 1934 two new camera tubes dubbed super-Emitron and CPS Emitron. The super-Emitron was between ten and fifteen times more sensitive than the original Emitron and iconoscope tubes and, in some cases, this ratio was considerably greater. It was used for an outside broadcasting by the BBC, for the first time, on Armistice Day 1937, when the general public could watch in a television set how the King lay a wreath at the Cenotaph. This was the first time <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> broadcast a live street scene from cameras installed on the roof of neighbor buildings, because neither Farnsworth nor RCA could do the same before the 1939 New York World's Fair.|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} Kate Bowler, {{the prosperity}} gospel was formed from {{the intersection of}} three different ideologies: Pentecostalism, New Thought, and [...] "an American gospel of pragmatism, individualism, and upward mobility." [...] This [...] "American gospel" [...] was best exemplified by Andrew Carnegie's Gospel of Wealth and Russell Conwell's famous sermon [...] "Acres of Diamonds", in which Conwell equated poverty with sin and asserted <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> become rich through hard work. This gospel of wealth, however, was an expression of Muscular Christianity and understood success {{to be the result}} of personal effort rather than divine intervention.|$|E
60|$|Her father came, {{and found}} them both very glowing, like an open flower. He loved to sit with them. Where there was a perfume of love, anyone who came must breathe it. They were both very quick and alive, lit up from the other-world, {{so that it was}} quite an {{experience}} for them, <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> else <b>could</b> exist.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Bentley {{has taken}} extreme {{measures}} in salvaging her credibility by monitoring Ellie's {{activity on the}} laptop. Chuck confronts Bentley about interfering with his family, and discovers a surveillance video of Ellie. Bentley later comments that Ellie, is incredibly smart and <b>that</b> if <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> figure out the Intersect it is her, though she cautions Chuck about taking Ellie into the spy world.|$|R

"Please {{forget that}} promise," [...] pleaded the charcoal-burner, earnestly; [...] "I have been safe from molestation for many years, because I was poor and possessed nothing <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> else <b>could</b> envy.

500|$|Not all of Cartier's {{work was}} so well regarded; in particular, his {{cinematic}} efforts have not achieved {{the level of}} praise of his television work. In the book America's Best, Britain's Finest: A Survey of Mixed Movies, critic John Howard Reid says of Cartier's 1958 film Passionate Summer: [...] "It's hard to believe <b>that...</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> make such a dull movie. Yet {{this is precisely what}} director Rudolph Cartier has done. I've never heard of Mr Cartier before or since but presumably he made this brief foray into films from that synthetic world of ugly close-ups—TV." ...|$|E
500|$|Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon 2 Original Soundtrack was {{moderately}} {{well received}} by reviewers. [...] Patrick Gann said {{that despite the}} flaws of the game, the soundtrack [...] "held strong" [...] and claimed <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> enjoy the album, [...] "given the right atmosphere". Chris of Square Enix Music Online termed it [...] "a decent effort" [...] and a [...] "coherent and thorough work". He especially praised the contributions of Sekito and Ito, though he was termed the tracks from Kawakami and Tanioka [...] "unmemorable". He concluded that while there were no poor tracks on the album, several of the themes were [...] "limited thematically and emotionally" [...] {{and he could not}} recommend the soundtrack to a wide audience.|$|E
500|$|Commentators have {{generally}} accepted the trial jury's verdict that the Claimant was Arthur Orton. However, McWilliam cites the monumental study by Douglas Woodruff (1957), {{in which the}} author posits that the Claimant could just possibly have been Roger Tichborne. Woodruff's principal argument is the sheer improbability <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> conceive such an imposture from scratch, at such a distance, and then implement it: [...] "t was carrying effrontery {{beyond the bounds of}} sanity if Arthur Orton embarked with a wife and retinue and crossed the world, knowing that they would all be destitute if he did not succeed in convincing a woman he had never met and knew nothing about first-hand, that he was her son".|$|E

50|$|The {{result was}} an {{aircraft}} that was substantially simpler to build (just two wings and a rudder, {{two of which}} moved, with no ailerons or other control surfaces) and easier to fly (just a control stick, no rudder pedals at all) than a conventional aircraft.

60|$|As James ran along, at {{the heels}} of Nat, he was struck with the strangeness of the scene, and the {{noiselessness}} with which the band of moccasin-footed men flitted among the trees. Not a word was spoken. All had implicit confidence in their leader, the most experienced bush fighter on the frontier, and knew <b>that,</b> if <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> lead them safe from the perils that surrounded them, it was Rogers.|$|R
500|$|Football was Dodd's lifelong passion, but at Tech he {{was just}} as obsessed with the notion that his players should get an {{education}} as he was with teaching them how to play football. Other coaches and sportswriters of his era were united in their puzzlement <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> coach with such a light hand and still win so many games. However, Coach Dodd knew that his [...] "Books First" [...] reputation caused parents to favor Georgia Tech over his competition. Georgia Tech often played teams that were physically superior but Bobby Dodd would still find a way win. The experts called it [...] "Dodd's luck", but his success actually came from an understanding of motivational psychology, football strategy, and innovative game-planning.|$|E
500|$|Matt Collar, {{writing for}} AllMusic, {{declared}} [...] "The record's collaborative foundation crackles on every track, but Hayley Williams, a ballsy, extroverted frontwoman {{with a voice}} big enough to stop time, proves unequivocally to be the cunning talent of the band, no matter how vital York and Davis may be". Collar regards it their best album. At AbsolutePunk, Jack Appleby said [...] "Instead of pursuing all things epic or intentionally moving to a specific sound, the band had a blast pursuing every genre under the sun, creating a damn good album in the process...Chances are you won't dedicate undivided attention to Paramore, but you'll regularly queue the whole record." [...] He concluded with that the album isn't for everyone, but has something <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> enjoy.|$|E
500|$|Minaj {{is known}} for her {{animated}} rapping style, her flow in particular. She often combines metaphors, punch lines and word play into her work, which {{has been compared to}} her mentor Lil Wayne. The New York Times called Minaj [...] "a sparkling rapper with a gift for comic accents and unexpected turns of phrase. She's a walking exaggeration, outsize in sound, personality and look. And she's a rapid evolver, discarding old modes as easily as adopting new ones." [...] Although many critics describe her technique as bubblegum rap, Minaj said: [...] "What people don't know is that before I was doing that craziness I was doing me, I was just doing regular sounding rap <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> hear and identify with. But once I started doing all that weird shit—I'm not mad at it because it got everyone's attention." ...|$|E

[...] The archdeacon was never ill himself, and did not therefore understand <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> else <b>could</b> in truth be prevented by illness from keeping an appointment. He regarded all such excuses as subterfuges, and in the present instance he was not far wrong.|$|R
500|$|For a time, Longfellow's {{home was}} one of the most photographed and most {{recognizable}} homes in the United States. In the early twentieth century Sears, Roebuck and Company sold scaled-down blueprints of the home so <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> build their own version of Longfellow's home. [...] Several replicas of Longfellow's home appear throughout the United States. One replica, simply called Longfellow House, still exists in Minneapolis. Originally built by businessman Robert [...] "Fish" [...] Jones, it currently serves as an information center for the Minneapolis Park System and is on the Grand Rounds Scenic Byway. A full-scale replica of the house was built in Great Barrington, Massachusetts at the turn of the 20th century. This building is the only remaining full-scale replica of Longfellow's original home maintaining all the original historical character. There is also a replica in Aberdeen, South Dakota on Main St.|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{nearly a}} century later, as {{the rule of the}} Qing Empire {{expanded}} over wider groups of people, writers and gazetteers recast their descriptions away from reflecting degree of acculturation, and toward a system that defined the aborigines relative to their submission or hostility to Qing rule. Qing used the term [...] "raw/wild/uncivilized" [...] (...) to define those people who had not submitted to Qing rule, and [...] "cooked/tamed/civilized" [...] (...) for those who had pledged their allegiance through their payment of a head tax. According to the standards of the Qianlong Emperor and successive regimes, the epithet [...] "cooked" [...] was synonymous with having assimilated to Han cultural norms, and living as a subject of the Empire, but it retained a pejorative designation to signify the perceived cultural lacking of the non-Han people. This designation reflected the prevailing idea <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> be civilized/tamed by adopting Confucian social norms.|$|E
500|$|The {{early years}} of the Republic were a time of {{external}} strife and periodic popular unrest. In 494BC, under harsh measures from patrician creditors, during a military campaign, the plebeians under arms seceded to the Mons Sacer outside the city and refused to fight in the campaign without political concessions. With the pressure of an external threat, the patricians were forced to create the office of plebeian tribune (...) who were declared sacrosanct, i.e. that they were declared inviolable and <b>that</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> be summarily executed for violation of the sanctity of his person. This was the basis of the tribune's ability to veto (literally translated as [...] "I forbid") any political act or to protect any individual from an injustice committed by a magistrate, known as intercessio and auxilium, respectively. The people gave the tribunes, whose number is unclear, two assistants known as plebeian aediles.|$|E
