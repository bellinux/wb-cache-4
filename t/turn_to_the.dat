Pines Bridge Road was once NY135, and its junction with NY134 in Kitchawan was NY135's eastern terminus. From Pines Bridge Road, NY134 bends southward to run alongside a reservoir inlet connecting to Cornell Brook.

In addition, favorable conditions allowed the storm to maintain its identity over land. Overall, Cyclone LeonEline traveled over 11,000km (6,800mi) during its 29day duration.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} depression developed between the Cape Verde islands {{and the west}} coast of Africa on August18, although it was not classified as a tropical cyclone for another week. The depression tracked west-southwestward for three days, followed by a <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west and later west-northwest. Late on August24 it intensified into a tropical storm about 700mi (1100km) east-northeast of Guadeloupe in the Lesser Antilles. The next day, the Miami Weather Bureau Office initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Able after the Hurricane Hunters confirmed the presence of a poorly defined center. Continuing to the west-northwest, the storm passed north of Puerto Rico and attained hurricane status on August27.|$|E

In {{the village of}} Delhi, the highway becomes known as Andes Road and has a short concurrency with NY10 in the village center. North of Delhi, it continues north towards the hamlet of Meredith, proceeding west past the hamlet.

5|$|After {{maintaining}} Category5 {{status for}} about 12hours, Ivan began a steady weakening trend due to another eyewall replacement cycle until reaching winds of 140mph (225km/h) on September 10. Early next day, the hurricane reorganized as it reached winds {{just shy of}} Category5 status. However, weakening occurred again due to an eyewall replacement cycle, and at 0330UTC on September 11 Ivan passed 23miles (37km) south of Portland Point, Jamaica, its closest approach, with winds of 150mph (240km/h). The hurricane was previously forecast to make landfall on the island, though the weakening and a <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west kept the strongest winds offshore; however, sustained winds of Category4 status were reported. While passing {{to the south of}} the island, the hurricane dropped heavy rainfall, with several stations reporting over 2feet (60cm) of precipitation. Ivan's last-minute <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west was due to a mid-level high pressure system over the eastern Gulf of Mexico. A slight weakening trend continued after passing the island, due to its northern outflow being disrupted by an upper-level low over the Bahamas. As it tracked further away from Jamaica, Ivan again rapidly intensified to Category5 status, and early on September 12 it reached its peak intensity of 165mph (265km/h) with a pressure of 910mbar (26.87inHg).|$|E

From this junction, the route passes a mix of urban residential and commercial establishments as {{it comes to a}} bridge over CSX’s Trenton Subdivision at the Bleigh Avenue intersection and continues into the Fox Chase neighborhood, crossing SEPTA’s Fox Chase Line south of the Fox Chase station. Upon reaching the Rhawn Street intersection in the downtown area of Fox Chase, the road makes a <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest.|$|E
5|$|At first, the {{depression}} slowly tracked westward {{because it was}} blocked by a ridge of high pressure to the north. The system was under frequent reconnaissance surveillance, and {{the depression}} remained poorly organized and continued to be at tropical depression status well into 29 July. The organization of the system hindered further development despite favorable conditions with low wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. Late on July 29, the system began to execute a <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> northwest {{with an increase in}} forward speed. It still remained a poorly organized tropical depression south of Louisiana.|$|E

The tropical storm peaked in windspeed as a 65mph (100km/h) high-end storm on November5.

5|$|Due to a weak mid-level {{anticyclone}} {{over the}} Gulf of Mexico {{that was not}} observed operationally, Mitch began a slow southerly motion on October27, passing very near Guanaja. The NHC had anticipated the movement {{to be part of}} a small loop in the Gulf of Honduras, although the agency noted continued uncertainty. Steadily deteriorating, Mitch weakened below major hurricane intensity late on October28, due to land interaction, upwelling, and possibly an eyewall replacement cycle. On October29, the hurricane made landfall in Honduras, east of La Ceiba, with winds of 80mph (130km/h). Despite being over land, the NHC continued to predict a <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north, which would allow for restrengthening.|$|E

Shortly after Pauline made landfall, the warning was extended northwestward to Manzanillo, Colima, and later to Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco. Pauline's <b>turn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west-northwest near landfall was unexpected, resulting in hurricane conditions {{with only a few}} hours notice in some areas.|$|E
