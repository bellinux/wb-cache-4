5|$|After France surrendered, Marcinkus managed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the French {{colonies in}} Africa (Morocco and Algeria). He {{decided to go}} to Great Britain and {{continue}} fighting, but the French army's terms of armistice at Compiègne and tensions between Britain and France made this difficult. On 12 August 1940 he was finally demobilized from the French army. Marcinkus and some of his associates concocted a daring plan to commandeer several aircraft without authorization and fly to England. The plan was not executed due to increased security at airfields and other circumstances. He finally received the necessary documents enabling him to go to Britain in autumn of 1940.|$|E

5|$|Orozco {{remained}} unsatisfied {{with the}} political positions he was offered in the Madero government. He became even more angry when Madero asked him to fight Zapata in central Mexico. As a result, in March 1912--less {{than a year after}} the battle of Ciudad Juárez--Orozco formally declared himself in rebellion against Madero. He subsequently supported Victoriano Huerta in his coup d'état against Madero. After Huerta's fall Orozco went into exile in the US and was eventually killed by Texas Rangers while trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back into Mexico to start another revolt.|$|E
5|$|When Norway was {{invaded by}} Germany in April 1940, Lie {{immediately}} started organising resistance, {{taking charge of}} free radio broadcasts from various locations in the country. For two months this work kept him in constant movement around Norway, and on 7 June 1940, when King Haakon VII and the government left the country for London, he was in Vadsø, replacing a broken transmitter. At this point further broadcasts became impossible, and Lie had <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> south, through Finland and Sweden, to Oslo.

5|$|Having become {{versed in}} Kuba {{language}} and culture, Sheppard took {{a team of}} men {{to the edge of}} Kuba territory in 1892. His original plan was to ask for directions to the next village under the guise of purchasing supplies, but the chief of the village only allowed one of his men to go. Sheppard used a variety of tricks <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> further into the kingdom, including having a scout follow a group of traders and, most famously, eating so many eggs that the townspeople could no longer supply him and his scout was able {{to gain access to the}} next village to find more eggs. Eventually, however, he encountered villagers that would allow him to go no further. While Sheppard was formulating a plan, the king's son, Prince N'toinzide, arrived and arrested Sheppard and his men for trespassing.|$|E

A post-mortem soon confirmed he had drowned. In an inquest at Southwark Coroner's Court on 20 July, Coroner John Sampson recorded a verdict of accidental death. It had been assumed in several reports of his death that, while trying <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> home by dinghy from The Wibbley Wobbley to his houseboat The Sea Sovereign just fifteen yards away across Greenland Dock, Hardee had lost his balance and drowned while drunk.

5|$|The portal {{takes the}} marine {{directly}} into Hell, where he proceeds to fight {{his way through}} the large number of demons to the Soul Cube, defeating its demonic guardian. The marine is then able to reinitialize the teleportation equipment left by research expeditions into Hell and return to the Delta Labs. Betruger, however, tells the marine that although the main UAC teleporter has been destroyed, Hell is opening a Hellmouth on Mars, capable of bringing millions of demons to Mars. Further in the Delta Labs, the marine encounters the injured Swann. Swann informs the marine that Kelly has been working with Hell for possibly the whole time, and has been transformed by the demons. Telling the marine that Campbell has gone after Kelly, Swann gives the marine his PDA containing information on the location on the Hellmouth under the surface of Mars and assures him that he will try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> out of the base alone.|$|E
5|$|When Ladislaus of Naples conquered Rome in 1413, John XXIII {{was forced}} to flee to Florence. He was {{compelled}} by Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, to convoke the Council of Constance in 1414, although when the threat to his pontificate and possibly his person became apparent, he fled in 1415. Although he expected his departure would disperse the council, the members of which he called to join him {{under the protection of}} Frederick IV, Duke of Austria, it continued to operate where they were. As John XXIII tried <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> towards the territory of John II, Duke of Burgundy, Frederick IV surrendered him to the custody of Sigismund and the Council, and he was imprisoned by Louis III.|$|E
5|$|While Montejo was {{preparing}} his considerable expedition, he received {{news of the}} precarious position of the Spanish in Higueras. Fearing {{the collapse of the}} colony, he appointed Alonso de Cáceres as captain-general, and sent him ahead with a small detachment of soldiers, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> overland via Santiago de Guatemala, recruiting more soldiers en route. Cáceres was an experienced officer, who had already fought in the conquest of Yucatán. In Santiago, Cáceres recruited a further 20 cavalry, and acquired additional arms and supplies. He arrived in Gracias a Dios with his relief force in late November or early December 1536, and described the settlement as being in a deplorable state. His expedition gave temporary respite, and morale was improved with the news that Montejo would soon be in Honduras. However, there was some political resistance to Cáceres from the town council, appointed by the Alvarados, which wished to see Pedro de Alvarado continue as governor, and Honduras unified with Guatemala, and factional plotting ensued.|$|E

5|$|According to oral history, Rainilaiarivony {{was born}} on a {{day of the week}} {{traditionally}} viewed as inauspicious for births. Custom in much of Madagascar dictated that such unlucky children had to be subjected to a trial by ordeal, such as prolonged exposure to the elements, since it was believed the misfortune of their day of birth would ensure a short and cursed life for the child and its family. But rather than leave the child to die, Rainilaiarivony's father reportedly followed the advice of an ombiasy (astrologer) and instead amputated a joint from two fingers on his infant son's left hand to dispel the ill omen. The infant was nonetheless kept outside the house to avert the possibility that evil might still befall the family if the child remained under their roof. Relatives took pity and adopted Rainilaiarivony to raise him within their own home. Meanwhile, Rainilaiarivony's older brother Rainivoninahitriniony enjoyed the double privilege of his status as elder son and freedom from a predestined evil fate. Rainiharo selected and groomed his elder son to follow in his footsteps as Commander-in-Chief and Prime Minister, while Rainilaiarivony was left <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> in the world by his own merits.|$|E
5|$|Hare was {{released}} on 5 February 1829—his extended stay in custody had been undertaken for his own protection—and was assisted in leaving Edinburgh in disguise by the mailcoach to Dumfries. At one of its stops he was recognised by a fellow-passenger, Erskine Douglas Sandford, a junior counsel who had represented Wilson's family; Sandford informed his fellow passengers of Hare's identity. On arrival in Dumfries the news of Hare's presence spread and a large crowd gathered at the hostelry where he was due to stay the night. Police arrived and arranged for a decoy coach to draw off the crowd while Hare escaped through a back window and into a carriage which {{took him to the}} town's prison for safekeeping. A crowd surrounded the building; stones were thrown at the door and windows and street lamps were smashed before 100 special constables arrived to restore order. In the small hours of the morning, escorted by a sheriff officer and militia guard, Hare was taken out of town, set down on the Annan Road and instructed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to the English border. There were no subsequent reliable sightings of him and his eventual fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium. The 4e DI {{was ordered}} {{to hold the line}} of the Sambre river. De Hauteclocque was placed in charge of three {{infantry}} battalions. To his dismay, orders came to pull back to the Canal de l'Escaut. From there the 4e DI retreated northward, becoming encircled in the Lille pocket on 28 May. De Hauteclocque received permission to escape through German lines. He attempted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back to the French lines by pretending to be a civilian refugee, but was apprehended by a German patrol and taken prisoner when they discovered an old military pay receipt. He was taken back to a German command post, where he secretly destroyed the receipt. He convinced a German colonel that he had been wounded in Morocco, suffered from malaria, and had six children, all of which was true, and he was thus exempted from military service, which was false. The Germans let him go. He then {{made his way to the}} Crozat Canal, swam across, and encountered a French patrol.|$|E

5|$|The son of {{an aristocratic}} family, de Hauteclocque {{graduated}} from the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr, the French military academy, in 1924. After service with the French Occupation of the Ruhr and in Morocco, he returned to Saint-Cyr as an instructor. He was awarded the croix de guerre des théâtres d'opérations extérieures for leading goumiers in an attack on caves and ravines on Bou Amdoun on 11 August 1933. During the Second World War he fought in the Battle of France. He then {{became one of the}} first <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to Britain to fight with the Free French under General Charles de Gaulle, adopting the nom de guerre of Leclerc so that his wife and children would not be put at risk if his name appeared in the papers. He was sent to French Equatorial Africa, where he rallied local leaders to the Free French cause, and led a force against Gabon, whose leaders supported Vichy France. From Chad he led raids into Italian-controlled Libya. After his forces captured Kufra, he had his men swear an oath known today as the Serment de Koufra, in which they pledged to fight on until their flag flew over the Strasbourg Cathedral.|$|E

Using hosts <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> to a ruined city, he meets up with Magnus, who reveals that Palutena's army has turned against humanity and that Pit's body is attacking humans. Using Magnus' body, Pit defeats his body and repossesses it. Viridi then flies him to Palutena's capital of Skyworld which {{has been reduced to}} ruins: Viridi reveals that the Lunar Sanctum was a prison holding the Chaos Kin, a soul-devouring creature that escaped when Pit destroyed the base. The Chaos Kin has possessed Palutena and caused her to become deranged. After obtaining the Lightning Chariot, Pit breaks through the defensive barrier around Skyworld's capital and defeats Palutena. The Chaos Kin then steals her soul, leading to both Pit and Dark Pit pursuing the Chaos Kin into its dimension, the Chaos Vortex, to retrieve Palutena's soul. To save Dark Pit from a final attack from the defeated Chaos Kin, Pit overuses his Power of Flight, burning his wings and nearly dying in the process.|$|E
5|$|Moreno González {{was born}} in the ranchería of Guanajuatillo in Apatzingán, Michoacán, Mexico at around 5:00a.m. on 8 March 1970. There are few details of Moreno González's upbringing, but {{religion}} may have {{played an important role in}} his early life. His parents had 13 children (including Moreno González). His father Manuel Moreno was reportedly an alcoholic and had several mistresses, and one day he left his family when Moreno González was still very young, forcing his mother to singlehandedly raise the whole family. With their father gone, Moreno González and his siblings lived under the strict discipline of their mother. According to his autobiography, Moreno González had a love-hate relationship with his mother; as a child, he was beaten by his mother for being troublesome and getting into fights. In one occasion, he recalled that his mother once forced him <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back to his house by walking on his knees while keeping his arms stretched like a cross throughout the whole day for stealing an animal. Such treatments helped him develop resentment as to partially explain his violent behavior as an adult, he argued. He admitted, however, that he often got into fist fights with other kids from Guanajuatillo and the surrounding rancherías. Moreno González recalled that he would not always win and that he once got into 10 fights in a single day. His violent reputation as a child helped him earn the nickname El Más Loco ("The Craziest One")—which he held onto for the rest of his life—among his siblings and other kids from the area where he grew up.|$|E
