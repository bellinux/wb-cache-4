5|$|Typhon– A Titan imprisoned {{within a}} {{mountain}} after the Great War. Gaia directed Kratos to <b>Typhon</b> for aid. When <b>Typhon</b> refused to help him, Kratos blinded him and stole his magical bow, Typhon's Bane. His fate is unknown. The character was voiced by Fred Tatasciore in God of War II.|$|E
5|$|The Ancient Greek Τυφῶν (Tuphôn, <b>Typhon)</b> is not {{unrelated}} and has secondarily contaminated the word. The Persian and Chinese terms {{may have}} been originated by the Greek word in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes, its skyline {{dominated}} by the massive statue, the Colossus of Rhodes, is a war-torn city under assault by Kratos, the God of War, and his Spartan army. The Lair of <b>Typhon,</b> hidden in an unknown location, is a snow-topped mountain and prison of the Titans <b>Typhon</b> and Prometheus. The Island of Creation is a vast island located {{at the edge of}} the world and home to the Sisters of Fate. The island is host to deadly traps, puzzles, and monsters. On the outskirts of the island are the Steeds of Time, and on the island itself are the Temples of Lakhesis and Atropos, and the Bog of the Forgotten, which hides the Gorgon Euryale and is the site of Jason of the Argonauts' last battle. Beyond the Bog are the Lowlands and the Great Chasm: a huge divide that blocks the way to the Palace of the Fates. At the base of the Chasm is the realm of Tartarus—prison of the Titan Atlas, condemned to hold the world on his shoulders. The Temple of the Fates is also filled with traps and monsters, while the final battle occurs on Mount Olympus, home to the gods.|$|E

60|$|After a conversazione of {{two hours}} my {{visitors}} depart, and we lose no time--for we must rise at cockcrow--in spreading our mats round the common room. You would admire the Somali pillow [29], a dwarf pedestal of carved wood, with a curve {{upon which the}} greasy poll and its elaborate frisure repose. Like the Abyssinian article, it resembles the head-rest of ancient Egypt in all points, except {{that it is not}} worked with <b>Typhons</b> and other horrors to drive away dreadful dreams. Sometimes the sound of the kettledrum, the song, and the clapping of hands, summon us at a later hour than usual to a dance. The performance is complicated, and, as usual with the trivialities easily learned in early youth, it is uncommonly difficult to a stranger. Each dance has its own song and measure, and, contrary to the custom of El Islam, the sexes perform together. They begin by clapping the hands and stamping where they stand; to this succeed advancing, retiring, wheeling about, jumping about, and the other peculiarities of the Jim Crow school. The principal measures are those of Ugadayn and Batar; these again are divided and subdivided;--I fancy that the description of Dileho, Jibwhayn, and Hobala would be as entertaining and instructive to you, dear L., as Polka, Gavotte, and Mazurka would be to a Somali.|$|R
5|$|Bovidae have {{featured}} in stories {{since at least}} the time of Aesop's fables from Ancient Greece around 600 BC. Fables by Aesop include The Crow and the Sheep, The Frog and the Ox, and The Wolf and the Lamb. The mythological creature Chimera, depicted as a lion, with the head of a goat arising from its back, and a tail that might end with a snake's head, was one of the offspring of <b>Typhon</b> and Echidna and a sibling of such monsters as Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra. The sheep, synonymous with the goat in Chinese mythology, is the eighth animal of the Chinese zodiac, and a symbol of filial piety.|$|E
5|$|City at the End of Time is a 2008 {{science fiction}} novel by American writer Greg Bear. It was {{published}} in August 2008 by Del Rey in the United States, and Gollancz in the United Kingdom. The story follows three drifters in present-day Seattle who are tormented by strange dreams of the Kalpa, a city one hundred trillion years in the future. The Kalpa is attempting {{to ward off the}} <b>Typhon,</b> an inexplicable entity that has consumed the rest of the ancient universe and broken down the laws of physics.|$|E
5|$|The god Hermes {{is not in}} the game, but in the novel, he is {{responsible}} for informing Athena that Kratos is committing suicide. New characters include Coeus, the First Officer of Kratos' ship, and the two servants of Medusa: Jurr and a blind man. The twins encountered in the sex mini-game are revealed to be the daughters of Aphrodite named Zora and Lora. The book also explains how certain creatures of the mythology that were slain by heroes are, apparently, still alive. For example, Zeus recollects that Hercules slew the Hydra, and Athena confirms this, but informs Zeus that the new Hydra is a newborn spawn of the Titans <b>Typhon</b> and Echidna, and was released by Ares.|$|E
6000|$|When Xavier was {{come back}} to Goa, and it was known that he {{designed}} a voyage to Japan, his friends made use of all their endeavours to divert him from it. They first set before him {{the length of the}} way, which was thirteen hundred leagues; the certain and inevitable dangers to which he must expose his life, not only by reason of pirates, which continually infest those seas, and murder all who come into their hands, but also for the rocks, unknown to the most skilful pilots, and of certain winds called <b>Typhons,</b> which reign from China even to Japan, in a vast extent of sea. They said, [...] "That those impetuous hurricanes were used to whirl a vessel round, and founder it at the same moment; or else drive it with fury against the rocks, and split it in a thousand pieces." [...] They added, [...] "If, by miracle, he should happen to escape the pirates, and avoid the tempests, yet he could promise no manner of safety to himself in the ports of China, from whence the Portuguese were expelled; and, for what remained, if he were possessed with an unsatiable zeal, there were other vast kingdoms of the East, where the light of the gospel had not shone; that even in the neighbourhood of Goa there were isles remaining, and territories, of idolaters: that he might go thither in God's name, and leave the thoughts of those remote islands, which nature seemed to have divided from the commerce of mortals; and where the power of the Portuguese not being established, Christianity could not be able to maintain itself against the persecution of the Pagans." ...|$|R
5|$|Titan Quest {{begins with}} a narration, {{detailing}} how the Titans once ruled the primordial darkness before {{the light of the}} Olympian Gods appeared: after a great war, the Titans were exiled and imprisoned, and the Olympians ushered in a golden age for the mortal world. An unknown time later, a trio of lesser Titans known as Telkines broke the communication conduit linking Olympus with the mortal world, and summoned armies of monsters to terrorize the world and prepare for the release of the Titans. The player character begins their quest at the village of Helos, where beasts are destroying the local crops. Fighting their way through Greece, they learn of Telkines from a group called the Order of Prometheus. After defeating the first Telkine beneath the palace of Knossos, the player then travels to Egypt and attempts to restore the connection between Earth and Olympus. The ritual fails, and they must defeat a second Telkine. The player then pursues the final Telkine along the Silk Road to China. Pursuing the Telkine to the Wusou Mountains, the player is too late to prevent the release of the Titan <b>Typhon,</b> who travels to Olympus to destroy the gods. After the player defeats <b>Typhon,</b> Zeus speaks to the player, telling them that they, a human champion, have proved humanity can live without the protection of Olympus.|$|E
5|$|The {{protagonist of}} the game is Kratos (voiced by Terrence C. Carson), a Spartan warrior who became the God of War after killing the former, Ares. Other {{characters}} include Athena (Carole Ruggier), the Goddess of Wisdom; Zeus (Corey Burton), the King of the Gods and the main antagonist; several Titans—including Gaia (Linda Hunt), Atlas (Michael Clarke Duncan), Prometheus (Alan Oppenheimer), <b>Typhon</b> (Fred Tatasciore), and Cronos (Lloyd Sherr)—heroes Theseus (Paul Eiding) and Perseus (Harry Hamlin); the insane Icarus (Bob Joles); the Gorgon Euryale (Jennifer Martin); an undead version of the Barbarian King (Bob Joles); and the Sisters of Fate—Lakhesis (Leigh-Allyn Baker), Atropos (Debi Mae West), and Clotho (Susan Silo). Minor characters include the boat captain (Keith Ferguson) and a loyal Spartan soldier (Josh Keaton; credited as the Last Spartan). Kratos' wife Lysandra, their daughter Calliope, and the Titan Rhea appear in flashbacks. The gods Hades and Poseidon appear in flashbacks of the Great War, and in the final cutscene alongside Zeus, Helios, and Hermes on Olympus.|$|E
5|$|Four of {{the voice}} actors from the {{previous}} installment returned to reprise their roles, including Terrence C. Carson and Keith Ferguson, who voiced Kratos and the boat captain, respectively. Linda Hunt returned as the narrator, who was revealed to be the Titan Gaia, and Carole Ruggier returned in her final voicing of the character Athena. Both Paul Eiding, who had voiced Zeus and the gravedigger, and Fred Tatasciore, who had voiced Poseidon, returned but did not reprise those roles, and instead voiced the characters Theseus and <b>Typhon,</b> respectively. Corey Burton {{assumed the role of}} Zeus, who had voiced the character in the 1998 Disney animated film , and in the subsequent animated series Hercules. Famed actors Michael Clarke Duncan and Leigh-Allyn Baker lent their voices for the characters Atlas and Lakhesis, respectively. Actor Harry Hamlin was chosen to voice the character Perseus because of his previous portrayal of the same character in the 1981 feature film Clash of the Titans. Although removed early in the game's development, Cam Clarke is credited for the voice of Hercules. Keythe Farley was the voice director alongside Kris Zimmerman and Gordon Hunt.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes, Draco is {{represented}} as the demon son of Gaia, <b>Typhon.</b>|$|E

25|$|In Greek Mythology, {{the goddess}} Athena threw Mount Aitna onto {{the island of}} Sicily and upon either the gigante Enkeladus or <b>Typhon</b> during the giants' war against the gods.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Philbin made an {{appearance}} in Disney's Hercules {{as the voice}} of the mythical monster <b>Typhon.</b> Kathie Lee Grifford was also present {{as the voice of}} Typhon's mate, Echidna.|$|E

25|$|In Prometheus Bound (v 353), Aeschylus {{mentions}} the Cilician caves (probably Cennet and Cehennem), where the earth-born, hundred-headed monster <b>Typhon</b> dwelt before he withstood {{the gods and}} was stricken and charred by Zeus's thunderbolt.|$|E
25|$|<b>Typhon</b> {{the enemy}} of the Olympian gods is {{described}} as a vast grisly monster with a hundred heads and a hundred serpents issuing from his thighs, who was conquered and cast into Tartarus by Zeus, or confined beneath volcanic regions, where he is the cause of eruptions. <b>Typhon</b> is thus the chthonic figuration of volcanic forces. Serpent elements figure among his offspring; among his children by Echidna are: Cerberus (a monstrous three-headed dog with a snake for a tail and a serpentine mane); the serpent-tailed Chimaera; the serpent-like chthonic water beast Lernaean Hydra; and the hundred-headed serpentine dragon Ladon. Both the Lernaean Hydra and Ladon were slain by Heracles.|$|E
25|$|With {{the help}} of Gaia's advice, Zeus {{defeated}} the Titans. But afterwards, Gaia, in union with Tartarus, bore the youngest of her sons <b>Typhon,</b> {{who would be the}} last challenge to the authority of Zeus.|$|E
25|$|With the TVR S Series, Wheeler {{started by}} re-introducing the {{traditional}} design elements from the M-series. This became {{a great success}} for the company, and he followed up by introducing {{a number of new}} and bold body designs including the Chimaera, Griffith, Cerbera, Tuscan, Tamora, T350, <b>Typhon</b> and Sagaris.|$|E
25|$|According to Hesiod, the Hydra was the {{offspring}} of <b>Typhon</b> and Echidna. It possessed many heads, {{the exact number of}} which varies according to the source. Later versions of the Hydra story add a regeneration feature to the monster: for every head chopped off, the Hydra would regrow a couple of heads.|$|E
25|$|Rhodian vase {{painting}} is primarily known from Rhodian plates. These were produced using a polychrome technique {{with many of}} the details being incised as in black-figure painting. From about 560 to 530 BC situlas were common, inspired by Egyptian models. These show both Greek subjects, such as <b>Typhon,</b> as well as ancient Egyptian themes like Egyptian hieroglyphics and Egyptian sport disciplines.|$|E
25|$|In Greek mythology, the {{constellation}} is sometimes identified as Amalthea, the goat that suckled the infant Zeus after his mother, Rhea, saved {{him from being}} devoured by his father, Cronos. The goat's broken horn was transformed into the cornucopia or horn of plenty. Capricornus is also sometimes identified as Pan, the god with a goat's head, who saved himself from the monster <b>Typhon</b> by giving himself a fish's tail and diving into a river.|$|E
25|$|The series {{follows the}} {{exploits}} of Colonel-Commissar Ibram Gaunt and his regiment of scouts and recon specialists, the Tanith First-and-Only (nicknamed Gaunt's Ghosts), as they serve in the Sabbat Worlds Crusade. Their battles are normally {{against the forces of}} Chaos, although they briefly face orks on <b>Typhon</b> Eight. Up until Guns of Tanith the Ghosts are mainly pitted against heretical rebels armies, but on Phantine and in most of the campaigns following it they face the well-trained and elite Blood Pact. By the end of Only in Death, the Ghosts have been serving in the Crusade for roughly twelve years.|$|E
25|$|Several {{variations}} of the story are also found in Greek mythology as well. The story is attested in the legend of Zeus slaying the hundred-headed <b>Typhon</b> from Hesiod's Theogony, {{but it is also}} in the myths of the slaying of the nine-headed Lernaean Hydra by Heracles and the slaying of Python by Apollo. The story of Heracles's theft of the cattle of Geryon is probably also related. Although Heracles is not usually thought of as a storm deity in the conventional sense, he bears many attributes held by other Indo-European storm deities, including physical strength and a knack for violence and gluttony.|$|E
25|$|Percy Jackson {{learns that}} Kronos' forces are {{preparing}} to attack Olympus. Poseidon, Percy's father, decides {{that it is time}} for Percy to now fulfill the Great Prophecy. Seeking to defeat Kronos, like Achilles did, Percy bathes in the River Styx, making his body invulnerable except one small chosen part of his body (the small of his back). Kronos leads a siege of New York City and puts its citizens to sleep. Percy leads the campers, Hunters, nature spirits, and centaurs to protect Mount Olympus from Kronos and his forces. While they protect Olympus, the gods hold down the monster <b>Typhon</b> as he makes his way to New York. Kronos, possessing Luke's body, forces his way into Olympus and battles Percy in Olympus' throne room. <b>Typhon</b> reaches New York but is defeated after the arrival of Poseidon's forces, led by Tyson. Annabeth is able to make Luke come back to his senses, and Percy gives him Annabeth's knife. Luke stabs himself in his mortal spot (as he also was invulnerable from bathing in the River Styx) to destroy Kronos and save Mount Olympus, but Luke dies. The gods reward Percy and his friends, and offer him immortality. He rejects the offer, but instead requests the gods to claim all their children and to have cabins for all the gods, including the minor ones. Rachel Elizabeth Dare becomes the Oracle and recites the next Great Prophecy. The book finishes with Percy and Annabeth becoming a couple, and ominous clouds looming over Rachel's next Great Prophecy.|$|E
25|$|His fame {{as a poet}} drew Pindar into Greek politics. Athens, {{the most}} {{important}} city in Greece throughout his poetic career, was a rival of his home city, Thebes, and also of the island state Aegina, whose leading citizens commissioned {{about a quarter of}} his Victory Odes. There is no open condemnation of the Athenians in any of his poems but criticism is implied. For example, the victory ode mentioned above (Pythian 8) describes the downfall of the giants Porphyrion and <b>Typhon</b> and this might be Pindar's way of covertly celebrating a recent defeat of Athens by Thebes at the Battle of Coronea (447 BC). The poem ends with a prayer for Aegina's freedom, long threatened by Athenian ambitions.|$|E
25|$|Dante and Virgil {{approach}} the Central Well, {{at the bottom}} of which lies the Ninth and final Circle of Hell. The classical and biblical Giants – who perhaps symbolize pride and other spiritual flaws lying behind acts of treachery – stand perpetual guard inside the well-pit, their legs embedded in the banks of the Ninth Circle while their upper halves rise above the rim and can be visible from the Malebolge. Dante initially mistakes them for great towers of a city. Among the Giants, Virgil identifies Nimrod (who tried to build the Tower of Babel; he shouts out the unintelligible Raphèl mai amècche zabì almi); Ephialtes (who with his brother Otus tried to storm Olympus during the Gigantomachy; he has his arms chained up) and Briareus (who Dante claimed to have challenged the Gods); and Tityos and <b>Typhon,</b> who insulted Jupiter. Also here is the Giant Antaeus, who did not join in the rebellion against the Olympian Gods and therefore is not chained. At Virgil's persuasion, Antaeus takes the Poets in his large palm and lowers them gently to the final level of Hell.|$|E
500|$|Clute {{notes that}} the Kalpa is not, as the title suggests, the last city; they believe they are, but the last city is Nataraja, [...] "the city beyond the city {{at the end of}} time". Clute says that the <b>Typhon</b> is [...] "a kind of god and a kind of quasi-animate {{principle}} of destruction" [...] that is attempting to destroy the universe because it [...] "cannot tolerate being told" [...] or [...] "observed". The creation and evolution of the universe is observed and recorded, and the <b>Typhon</b> will not tolerate this telling. In the Kalpa, Polybiblios creates Babel fragments ("Borgesian libraries that do not end") that, when brought together, will form a [...] "backstory" [...] that retells the history of the universe and overwhelms the <b>Typhon.</b>|$|E
500|$|The word typhoon, {{which is}} used today in the Northwest Pacific, may be derived from Arabic ţūfān (طوفان) (similar in Hindustani and Persian), which in turn {{originates}} from Greek <b>Typhon</b> (Τυφών), a monster from Greek mythology associated with storms. The related Portuguese word tufão, used in Portuguese for typhoons, is also derived from <b>Typhon.</b> The word is also similar to Chinese [...] "táifēng" [...] (Simplified Chinese: 台风, Traditional Chinese: 颱風) (fēng = wind), [...] "toifung" [...] in Cantonese, [...] "taifū" [...] (台風) in Japanese, and [...] "taepung" [...] (태풍) in Korean.|$|E
500|$|Kratos {{is slowly}} dragged to the Underworld but is {{saved by the}} Titan Gaia. Gaia tells Kratos that she once raised the young Zeus, who {{eventually}} betrayed the Titans as vengeance for the cruelty inflicted on his siblings by Zeus' father, Cronos. She instructs Kratos to find the [...] "Sisters of Fate", who can alter time, prevent his death, and allow him his revenge on Zeus. With the aid of Pegasus, Kratos finds the lair of Gaia's brother <b>Typhon.</b> Imprisoned under a mountain, <b>Typhon</b> is angered at the intrusion and traps Pegasus, forcing Kratos to explore on foot. Kratos encounters the Titan Prometheus, who is chained in mortal form and tortured at Zeus' directive for giving fire to mankind. Prometheus begs {{to be released from}} his torment, so Kratos confronts <b>Typhon</b> to steal his magical bow. He blinds the massive Titan with it to escape and then uses it to free Prometheus, who falls into a fire and dies, finally free of eternal torture. The Immolation releases the power of the Titans which Kratos absorbs, using it to free Pegasus and then fly to the Island of Creation.|$|E
500|$|In the future, the <b>Typhon</b> is {{destroying}} history and world-lines are being broken, merging {{the past and}} the present. With the Chaos closing in on the Kalpa, the inhabitants (all noötic) are unable to venture outside the city walls. Under Ishanaxade's instructions, they create [...] "breeds", copies of ancient humans, using primordial matter. They send them in groups into the Chaos to find out if Nataraja still stands, but none return. Ishanaxade herself ventures out, but is not heard from again. As the <b>Typhon</b> starts breaching the Kalpa, the last batch of breeds, including Jebrassy and Taidba, leave the city in search of help. Armed with portable reality generators, they slowly progress through the unreal landscape in search of the rebel city.|$|E
500|$|In full, {{the poem}} is rife with {{descriptions}} of the terrifying aspects of hell, those that dwell there, and the actions thereof. Among those in De Esque's hell are Thomas Fortune Ryan, John Pierpont Morgan, August Belmont, Jr. and John D. Rockefeller. Also appearing regularly throughout [...] "Betelguese" [...] are many Greek mythological figures, including {{the subject of the}} frontispiece, <b>Typhon.</b>|$|E
500|$|City at the End of Time {{is about}} the Kalpa, the last city on Earth, one hundred {{trillion}} years in the future. The novel's backstory describes how the aging universe continued expanding and its spacetime fabric weakened. With the galaxies burnt out, humanity dispersed across the cosmos, where they encountered the <b>Typhon,</b> an inexplicable entity that was destroying the decaying universe. It consumed matter and replaced space-time with emptiness and inconsistencies beyond the laws of physics. The resulting Chaos spread rapidly, driving some humans back to ancient Earth with its rekindled sun. In an attempt {{to fend off the}} approaching <b>Typhon,</b> leaders of the dying Earth sent for Polybiblios, a human living with the Shen, an ancient alien race. Polybiblios returned to Earth with his adopted daughter, Ishanaxade, a being he had constructed from [...] "fate-logs" [...] of intelligent species collected by the Shen. After the Shen system fell, and the Chaos surrounded Earth, its leaders instructed everybody to convert themselves from primordial (real) matter to noötic (virtual) mass. As each city fell, its inhabitants retreated to the last remaining cities, the Kalpa and Nataraja. Using knowledge he had gleaned from the Shen, Polybiblios built reality generators to protect the Kalpa. Nataraja, which had rebelled against the instruction to convert to noötic matter, was left to fend for itself.|$|E
