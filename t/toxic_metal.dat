5|$|Arsenal's {{final game}} at the stadium was their FA Premier League match on 7 May 2006 against Wigan Athletic, the last game of the season. The team needed to better the result of {{neighbours}} Tottenham Hotspur to again secure qualification for the Champions League.

The last goal scored in a regulation {{game at the}} stadium came in a Football Aid charity match when lifelong fan Alan Alger scored a penalty in the final minute of a fixture played on Thursday 8 June 2006 (exactly one month and one day after Henry's goal). After the stadium's closure, Arsenal held an auction to sell off many of the stadium's parts, including pieces of the pitch, the goalposts and former manager George Graham's desk.

40|$|Contamination of soils, water, and sediments by {{radionuclides}} and <b>toxic</b> <b>metals</b> from uranium mill tailings, {{nuclear fuel}} manufacturing {{and nuclear weapons}} production is a major concern. Studies of the mechanisms of biotransformation of uranium and <b>toxic</b> <b>metals</b> under various microbial process conditions {{has resulted in the}} development of two treatment processes: (1) stabilization of uranium and <b>toxic</b> <b>metals</b> with reduction in waste volume and (2) removal and recovery of uranium and <b>toxic</b> <b>metals</b> from wastes and contaminated soils. Stabilization of uranium and <b>toxic</b> <b>metals</b> in wastes is accomplished by exploiting the unique metabolic capabilities of the anaerobic bacterium, Clostridium sp. The radionuclides and <b>toxic</b> <b>metals</b> are solubilized by the bacteria directly by enzymatic reductive dissolution, or indirectly due to the production of organic acid metabolites.

40|$|Summary Bachelor thesis <b>Toxic</b> <b>metals</b> in food {{is focused}} on <b>toxic</b> <b>metals,</b> their description, {{toxicity}} and monitoring their content in foods. <b>Toxic</b> <b>metals</b> significantly contaminate the environment nowadays. The metals pollute the environment through burning fossil fuels, agriculture and producing and processing of metals. They occur in various forms and appear in compounds, rocks and minerals. Their toxicity for human and animals is substantial. Their toxicity {{is related to the}} form of occurrence, solubility in water and in organic solvents and their mobility in body and water. <b>Toxic</b> <b>metals</b> bind on SH group of proteins and work as an enzyme poisons. The most toxic effect was found in cadmium, but also other <b>metals</b> have significant <b>toxic</b> effect. Lead, Cadmium and Arsenic have carcinogenic effects and cause malignant tumour. Mercury and above mentioned have mutagenic and teratogenic effects. Significant contamination of the environment and food can lead to poisoning, which is expressed by various symptoms. <b>Toxic</b> <b>metals</b> are absorbed especially by inhalation and consumption of contaminated food. Agriculture crops are polluted from contaminated soil, water and using of fertilizers and pesticides. To meat and animal products, <b>toxic</b> <b>metals</b> come mainly from contaminated plants, which animals eat. Meat products can be polluted by incorrect technological procedure. In general are <b>toxic</b> <b>metals</b> cumulated by organisms in tissues, especially in kidneys and liver. Animals living in polluted area have a lot of these metals in their tissues. With its increasing age, cattle more accumulate <b>toxic</b> <b>metals</b> in its tissues, therefore maximum recommended age of slaughter is 3 years. Serious problem is high amount of mercury in fish, especially in the sea fish. The larger and more carnivorous the fish is, the more they cumulate mercury and the other metals. Especially in the contaminated sea, mainly polluted sea from oil, fish have more metals in tissues. Across the European Union, there were currently set strict limits on the contents of metals in food. Some limits were updated and added by the last findings last year. Keeping these limits is regularly checked...|$|R

40|$|<b>Toxic</b> <b>metals</b> and {{metalloid}} {{are being}} rapidly added from multiple pathways to aquatic ecosystem and causing severe threats to inhabiting fauna including fish. Being common {{in all the}} type of aquatic ecosystems such as freshwater, marine and brackish water fish {{are the first to}} get prone to <b>toxic</b> <b>metals</b> and metalloids. In addition to a number of physiological/biochemical alterations, <b>toxic</b> <b>metals</b> and metalloids cause enhanced generation of varied reactive oxygen species (ROS) ultimately leading to a situ- ation called oxidative stress. However, as an important com- ponent of antioxidant defence system in fish, the tripeptide glutathione (GSH) directly or indirectly regulates the scav- enging of ROS and their reaction products. Additionally, several other GSH-associated enzymes such as GSH reduc- tase (GR, EC 1. 6. 4. 2), GSH peroxidase (EC 1. 11. 1. 9), and GSH sulfotransferase (glutathione-S-transferase (GST), EC 2. 5. 1. 18) cumulatively protect fish against ROS and their reaction products accrued anomalies under <b>toxic</b> <b>metals</b> and metalloids stress conditions.
