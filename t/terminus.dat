40|$|AbstractIntegration {{of linear}} {{retrovirus}} DNA involves the concerted insertion of the viral <b>termini</b> (full-site integration) into the host chromosome. We investigated the interactions that occur between {{long terminal repeat}} (LTR) <b>termini</b> bound by avian retrovirus integrase (IN) for full-site integration in vitro. Wild-type (wt) or mutant LTR donors that possess gain-of-function (“G”) or loss-of-function (“L”) for full-site integration activity were used. G LTR <b>termini</b> are characterized as having significantly higher strand transfer activity than the wt and the L LTR <b>termini.</b> L LTR mutations are classified as partially or extremely defective for strand transfer activity. The L mutations were further classified by their ability to either permit or block the assembly of G or wt LTR <b>termini</b> into nucleoprotein complexes capable of full-site strand transfer. We demonstrated that avian myeloblastosis virus IN bound to G LTR <b>termini</b> increased the incorporation of partially defective L LTR <b>termini</b> into nucleoprotein complexes that were capable of full-site integration. The observed full-site integration activity of these assembled nucleoprotein complexes appeared {{to be influenced by}} each individual IN–LTR complex in trans. In contrast, extremely defective L LTR <b>termini</b> exhibited the ability to effectively block the assembly of wt LTR <b>termini</b> into nucleoprotein complexes capable of full-site strand transfer. Data from nonspecific DNA competition experiments suggested that IN had an apparent higher affinity for G LTR donor <b>termini</b> than for partially defective L LTR donor <b>termini</b> as measured by full-site integration activity. However, assembled nucleoprotein complexes containing either two G or two L LTR donors were stable, having a similar half-life of ∼ 2 h on ice. The results suggest that LTR <b>termini</b> bound by IN exhibit an allosteric effect to modulate full-site integration in vitro. Similar regulatory controls also appear to exist in vivo between the wt U 3 and wt U 5 LTR <b>termini</b> in retroviruses as well as purified retrovirus preintegration complexes that promoted full-site integration in vitro...|$|R

40|$|Protein N <b>termini</b> are {{a unique}} {{window to the}} {{functional}} state of the proteome, revealing translation initiation sites, co-translation truncation and modification, posttranslational maturation, and further proteolytic processing into different proteoforms with distinct functions. As a direct readout of proteolytic activity, protein N <b>termini</b> further reveal proteolytic regulation of diverse biological processes and provide a route to determine specific substrates and hence the physiological functions for any protease of interest. Here, we describe our current protocol of the successful Terminal Amine Isotope Labeling of Substrates (TAILS) technique, which enriches protein N-terminal peptides from complex proteome samples by negative selection. Genome-encoded N <b>termini,</b> protease-generated neo-N <b>termini,</b> and endogenously modified N <b>termini</b> are all enriched simultaneously.

40|$|DNA {{dependent}} {{protein kinase}} (DNA-PK) plays {{a central role}} in the non-homologous end-joining pathway of DNA double strand break repair. Its catalytic subunit (DNA-PK(CS)) functions as a serine/threonine protein kinase. We show that DNA-PK forms a stable complex at DNA <b>termini</b> that blocks the action of exonucleases and ligases. The DNA <b>termini</b> become accessible after autophosphorylation of DNA-PK(CS), which we demonstrate to require synapsis of DNA ends. Interestingly, the presence of DNA-PK prevents ligation of the two synapsed <b>termini,</b> but allows ligation to another DNA molecule. This alteration of the ligation route is independent of the type of ligase that we used, indicating that the intrinsic architecture of the DNA-PK complex itself is not able to support ligation of the synapsed DNA <b>termini.</b> We present a working model in which DNA-PK creates a stable molecular bridge between two DNA ends that is remodeled after DNA-PK autophosphorylation in such a way that the extreme <b>termini</b> become accessible without disrupting synapsis. We infer that joining of synapsed DNA <b>termini</b> would require an additional protein factor...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHelitrons are a {{class of}} {{prolific}} transposable elements in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome.
