500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the Millennium Group was a real-life organization called the Academy Group, which consisted of retired law enforcement agents working as a private investigative firm. Millennium creator Chris Carter {{had come to know}} members of the Academy Group through contacts he had made with the Federal Bureau of Investigation while researching his earlier television series The X-Files. The Academy Group focused on offender profiling, which shaped the main Millennium Group characters of Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn). Describing his initial inception of the Group, Carter has stated [...] "they believe that all this random violence we see these days, there may actually be some order in the chaos [...] These guys <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> care enough, that they can stem the tide of this thing".|$|E

[...] Michael Specter writes in The New Yorker, [...] "it was a five-thousand-word screed that accused nearly everyone connected with health care in America– officials at the Centers for Disease Control, in Atlanta, researchers at the National Institutes of Health, in Washington, doctors at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, in Manhattan, and local politicians (particularly Mayor Ed Koch)– of refusing to acknowledge the implications of the nascent AIDS epidemic. The article's harshest condemnation was directed at those gay men who seemed to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> ignored the new disease, it would simply go away.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{controversy}} involves {{those who}} feel that the emperor penguin's behavior {{can be viewed as}} an indication of intelligent design, and those who consider it to be an example of evolution by natural selection in action. Steve Jones, professor of genetics at University College London, is quoted as saying, [...] "Supporters of intelligent design <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> see something they don't understand, it must be God; they fail to recognise that they themselves are part of evolution. It appeals to ignorance, which is why {{there is a lot of}} it in American politics at the moment." [...] Author Susan Jacoby claims in her 2008 book, The Age of American Unreason (page 26), that the distributors of the movie deliberately avoided using the word [...] "evolution" [...] in order to avoid backlash from the American religious right, and writes, [...] "As it happens, the emperor penguin is literally a textbook example, cited in college-level biology courses, of evolution by means of natural selection and random mutation. ... The financial wisdom of avoiding any mention of evolution was borne out at the box office ..." ...|$|E

50|$|Once {{aboard the}} Terra Nova, Isaac and Carver {{must find a}} way to restore power to the {{derelict}} ship and find a new Shockpoint Drive in order to return to Earth. However, within the halls of the old Sovereign Colonies ship, they encounter the remnants of The Circle who've taken refuge inside and begun a new following in the name of the Necromorphs. After dealing with members of the Circle, as well as their own insanity, Isaac and Carver find a new ShockPoint Drive, but Isaac is now losing his mind. He protests installing the ShockPoint Drive into the ship, because he <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> install it, the Brethren Moons will follow them to Earth, and kill everyone living there. After Isaac and Carver have a hallucination of fighting each other, the hallucination is interrupted by another hallucination, in which the Brethren Moons reveal that they were only slowing Isaac and Carver down, and that they have known where Earth was all along.|$|R
2500|$|In {{discussing}} {{adapting the}} Boris Pasternak novel for television, screenwriter Andrew Davies revealed {{the task was}} [...] "daunting because the book is reckoned to be a masterpiece and the film is a great movie and one that I admire very much. Robert Bolt is the king of epic screenplay writers in my book. But as I got further into the book I kept thinking that I didn't agree with Robert Bolt about how to tell the story... and I began to feel much more excited." [...] He added, [...] "It was also a relief to find {{so much in the}} book that hadn't found its way into the first movie and could make great drama.... I thought the film does the spectacle really well. Rather surprisingly, it also explains the politics very well, but I thought it could do a better job on the relationships. It's probably a bit controversial, but I thought we could say more about Lara and Yuri and how they get together; about Lara's extraordinary situation {{at the beginning of the}} story and Yuri having a dreadful start to his life with his parents dying. None of these things really came out in the movie, but they are there in the book. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> look at both versions now, people will probably think that this version in a lot of ways works better for our time. It's more contemporary. I think they'll find the performances are more subtle yet speak to us in our time. Maybe my script will seem out of date in 20 years time because a lot of them do, but watching the original film, I think the central performances look stilted and dated now." ...|$|E

Galloway who fled to the wilderness above PCA {{at a place called}} Redstone Gulch because of an extremely hard test that drove him insane by Mr Harges, PCA's meanest and longest serving teacher that first taught when Charles went missing 50 years ago, Zoey and the gang decide to go and check it out for themselves. A boy named Leif agrees to take Zoey and the gang to the spot where Charles is supposed to have disappeared (the only way is by helicopter). It is later revealed the only reason why Leif agrees to take the gang is because he has a crush on Lola. Later in the episode Lola and Leif are seen making out. While they (Zoey and the gang) are there, they find an old PCA necklace. Using Quinn's special binoculars, they manage to read an inscription on the back. It {{turns out to be a}} necklace that belongs to Charles L. Galloway. Logan <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> show people at PCA the necklace, they'll become PCA legends, but when the gang refuse to let Logan keep the necklace, he steals it and puts it in Zoey's backpack. As they head back to PCA, a violent thunderstorm hits, forming a mysterious green cloud which follows them. While running, Zoey falls and breaks her ankle, meaning Chase had to pick her up and carry her back to PCA. Once there, the pair meet with the rest of the gang who discuss what the green cloud was, finally agreeing it was a ghost, and when Chase takes Zoey to the nurse, Zoey begins to see paranormal things. The ghost attacks Chase, Zoey and Stacey Dilsen who are all in the infirmary, and locks the door trapping them, despite Michael's numerous attempts to get them out. Finally, they get out and are followed again as the ghost tries to roll Zoey on a gurney down outdoor stairs with a bucket stuck on her head (luckily she jumps off but the gurney hits Stacey), until Quinn makes two glowing orbs that will make the ghost go away. Trapped in the classroom, they were due to have the important test in the next day. Zoey and Quinn throw the orbs at the cloud, and it disappears but then reappears again. Logan finally admits to the gang who is angry and annoyed with him for stealing the necklace and almost getting them all killed. After taking the necklace back to RedStone Gulch, the ghost returns it's resting spot, and Zoey, Chase, Michael and Logan rush back for the important exam. When Mr Harges demands to know why his classroom is in such a mess, the gang have to own up, saying it was Charles's ghost. Harges however shouts that it was just a story and there is no such thing as ghosts. Charles Galloway then attacks the teacher, spinning him in circles, to which he cancels the exam. Zoey thanks Charles as he returns to his resting place.|$|R
60|$|THE general {{election}} of 1847 did not materially {{alter the position}} of parties in the House of Commons. The high prices of agricultural produce which then prevailed naturally rendered the agricultural interest apathetic, and although the rural constituencies, from a feeling of esteem, again returned those members who had been faithful to the protective principle, the farmers did not exert themselves {{to increase the number}} of their supporters. The necessity of doing so was earnestly impressed upon them by Lord George Bentinck, who warned them then that the pinching hour was inevitable; but the caution was disregarded, and many of those individuals who are now the loudest in their imprecations on the memory of Sir Robert Peel, and who are the least content with the temperate course which is now recommended to them by those who have the extremely difficult office of upholding their interests in the House of Commons, entirely kept aloof, or would smile when they were asked for their support with sarcastic self-complacency, saying, 'Well, Sir, do you <b>think</b> after all <b>that</b> free trade has done us so much harm?' Perhaps <b>they</b> <b>think</b> now, <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had taken the advice of Lord George Bentinck and exerted themselves to return a majority to the House of Commons, it would have profited them more than useless execrations and barren discontent.

50|$|The player {{goes to his}} {{training}} {{to be a member}} of the Redview County Police Department. After he completes {{his training}}, he is now a member of the police force. The RCNN (Redview County News Network) broadcast a flash news report, in which a video of street racing was trending online. Dozens of racers began to upload copycat videos similar to the featured video, and it was revealed that street racing became viral around the county and they seek notoriety. Because of that, the public accuses the police of intimidation, and they hold several rallies and marches against RCPD. Days later, the Mayor of the county went to the general hospital of Redview to visit RCPD officer John McManis, who recovered from multiple injuries while on patrol. Because of sense of intimidation, the US Department of Justice has been summoned to investigate the cases. All officers have been placed on restricted duty and are accused of gross misconduct. With no agency available to serve the streets, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Vehicle Response Team, or VRT, has been called in to substitute RCPD while under investigation. While under restricted force, the player <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> want to win, they need new rules. Since the racers operate outside the law, the player decides to go rogue and infiltrate the racers, by means of impersonation. The player uses an impounded vehicle fitted with 'Pursuit Tech' to wreck some racers as an officer, while at the same time acting as a racer. He also creates his own alias: F-8, or Fate. He uses his tactics to apprehend the racers while pretending to be their opponent in their racing, without blowing cover. F-8 becomes popular online after several news reports of him wreaking havoc. As a result, violence breaks more and more. Because of that, the restricted officers have been called to be recruited to VRT. However, the VRT only accept skilled and aggressive drivers and they do not accept many cops because they only bring chaos instead of bringing peace. F-8 decides to join VRT, and a test is given to him. After passing the test, he is accepted into the VRT. The United States taxpayers invests millions of dollars into F-8 and expects that it will be well spent. His mission at the VRT begins: to disrupt the network of the racers. The VRT have identified three known associates of a street racer named Zephyr via radio signal decryption. The three use encrypted radios that ping during communication. Because of the three, locations of Zephyr are vague, so F-8 needs to seize the communications in order to clear the signals. After that, the radio signals are now clear, and they are able to decrypt Zephyr's radio signal. At the signal, a message from Zephyr says that he wants all racers to band together to protect themselves from their enemies. The VRT tell F-8 that he is the only one who can take him down. He then hunts Zephyr and takes him down. However, F-8's car is totaled during the pursuit. He is in critical condition, afraid to be killed in a high-speed collision with Zephyr. Even though his name was not mentioned in a following flash news report, the sources of the news state that F-8 has been terminated from the force for his reckless actions. In the aftermath, as it looks like the street racing epidemic is over, F-8, now a street racer, has just taken Zephyr's position as the top racer in Redview County and uploads a video, issuing a challenge to all racers.|$|R
