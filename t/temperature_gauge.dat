25|$|With the V70 Bi-Fuel Volvo {{continued}} {{to offer a}} factory CNG powered car. A 95-litre tank installed in the trunk allowed for a claimed range of 250km running on CNG only. Due to the bulky tank rear cargo space was considerably reduced. Drivers could choose whether their car should run on petrol or CNG {{at the touch of}} a button. On Bi-Fuel models the <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> in the instrument cluster was replaced by a level gauge for the gas tank. Several options, such as a trip computer and sports suspension, were not available for Bi-Fuel models.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} faulty air temperature probe (the total air temperature sensor, located {{on the front of}} the aircraft near the cockpit) that initially caused the pilot to turn the plane back for maintenance before the second takeoff attempt. The mechanic simply deactivated the probe because the aircraft's Minimum Equipment List allowed it to be left inoperative. On 22 August investigators interviewed the mechanic, who defended his action by saying that it had nothing to do with the crash. Spanair has supported the mechanic's view that deactivation of the probe is an accepted procedure. On 1 September a report, quoting Spanair, stated that the problem detected on the first takeoff attempt was overheating caused by a temperature gauge's de-icing system, rather than a dysfunction of the <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> itself, and that since icing was not a risk on that flight, the de-icing system had been deactivated by the mechanic with captain's approval.|$|E
500|$|After Villeneuve {{impressed}} James Hunt {{by beating}} him {{and several other}} Grand Prix stars in a non-championship Formula Atlantic race at Trois-Rivières in 1976, Hunt's McLaren team offered Villeneuve a Formula One deal {{for up to five}} races in a third car during the 1977 season. Villeneuve made his debut at the 1977 British Grand Prix, where he qualified 9th in McLaren's old M23, splitting the regular drivers Hunt and Jochen Mass who were driving newer M26s. In the race he set fifth fastest lap and finished 11th after being delayed for two laps by a faulty <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge.</b> The British press coverage of Villeneuve's performance was generally complimentary, including John Blunsden's comment in The Times that [...] "Anyone seeking a future World Champion {{need look no further than}} this quietly assured young man." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to its pre-dawn dedication on national television, Weather Machine had a public dedication at noon on August 24, attended by Mayor Bud Clark and other city officials. On that day, the machine displayed the sun symbol and a green light for good air quality, and indicated a temperature of [...] Following the fanfare, known officially as [...] "Fanfare for Weather Machine with Four Trumpets", jazz singer Shirley Nanette led the crowd in a rendition of [...] "You Are My Sunshine". Portland had good weather {{in the days following}} its dedication, preventing visitors from seeing all three symbols for an extended length of time (though all three symbols are displayed briefly during the daily two-minute sequence). This prompted the executive director of Pioneer Courthouse Square to consider altering the machine's schedule so that the public would have a chance to see all three symbols. The sculpture maintained good health until winter 1995, when its mechanical performance temporarily began deviating from noon and the <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> had difficulties working properly. In 2012, the machine malfunctioned and stopped operating for about a week.|$|E

500|$|Debuting in September 1992 as a 1993 model, the {{refreshed}} LS 400 (designed through 1991) {{was introduced}} {{with more than}} 50 changes, largely in response to customer and dealer requests. The vehicle received larger disc brakes, wheels, and tires, and adjustments {{were made to the}} suspension and power steering systems to improve handling. Stylistic changes included additional body side moldings and a revised grille, along with a greater selection of colors. For the interior, a standard passenger front airbag (first Toyota-built series production car available with passenger front airbag), an external <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge,</b> digital odometer, seat belt pretensioners, and chlorofluorocarbon-free refrigerant were added. In 1992, the Celsior introduced the world first GPS navigation system with voice instructions, supplied by Aisin. By 1994, the LS 400's U.S. base price exceeded , a figure that had steadily risen since the vehicle's introduction. Customer demand for the vehicle and shifts in foreign exchange rates contributed to the increase in price. The growing popularity of the LS internationally was an asset to Toyota, as Japan had entered into an economic recession in 1991, that later became what was called the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble or [...] "bubble economy". Production of the first-generation LS ended in September 1994 to make way for production of the second-generation model in October.|$|E
2500|$|Interiors {{were all}} new and {{featured}} a vastly improved instrument panel, that used ABS plastic {{for much of}} its construction. The standard instrument cluster featured five equally sized round pods and contained a speedometer, fuel gauge, and <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge,</b> along with various warning lights. The leftmost pod was a vent for the [...] "DirectAire" [...] ventilation system. A clock was optional with the standard instrument package. The [...] "Instrumentation Group", available on all V8 models, featured two large round pods centered on the steering wheel, containing the speedometer (with trip odometer) and a tachometer. A third equal sized pod on the left contained the DirectAire vent. The instrument cluster featured an ammeter, fuel gauge, <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge,</b> oil pressure gauge and clock in set of smaller stacked pods near {{the centre of the}} instrument panel. The seats were also new for 1972, the standard front bench seat had an integrated headrest for both outboard seating positions featuring, while the available high back buckets also featured integrated headrests. Ford continued to offer [...] "comfort weave" [...] vinyl seats as an option. These seats had the centre portion upholstered with a knitted vinyl material that allowed the upholstery to [...] "breathe" [...] unlike conventional vinyl. An optional 6-way power bench seat, replaced the 4-way seat offered in 1971.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, the Escort {{was sold}} as a two-door saloon (with {{circular}} front headlights and rubber flooring on the [...] "De Luxe" [...] model). The [...] "Super" [...] model featured rectangular headlights, carpets, a cigar lighter and a water <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge.</b> A two-door estate was introduced {{at the end of}} March 1968 which, with the back seat folded down, provided a 40% increase in maximum load space over the old Anglia 105E estate, according to the manufacturer. The estate featured the same engine options as the saloon, but it also included a larger, [...] clutch, stiffer rear springs and in most configurations slightly larger brake drums or discs than the saloon. A panel van appeared in April 1968 and the 4-door saloon (a bodystyle the Anglia was never available in for UK market) in 1969.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine whether beer affected the decomposition process by making the material break down at a faster rate. We studied this situation not only to see and understand the process of decomposition and the benefits of composting, but to also see how beer affected the natural decomposition of leaves and yard waste, as well as {{to reduce the amount of}} leaves and waste products that find their way into Lake Wingra. We layered mulched leaves and grass clippings in five composting bins. We placed two <b>temperature</b> <b>gauges</b> in each bin; one on the bottom and one in the middle.

2500|$|Most {{other changes}} to the Bel Air during its final years were {{identical}} to the more expensive Caprice and Impala lines, {{some of which were}} mandated by government safety regulations in the U.S. that included [...] front bumpers in 1973 and similar-designed rear bumpers in 1974. The 1975 models had a new roofline and (along with the Impala) grille that was a direct copy of the 1974 Caprice front end. Inside, there were new instrument cluster markings, radio and climate control graphics (the speedometer read up to , and had smaller numbers for kilometers per hour). Customers could buy their 1975 Bel Air with two new options: an Econominder gauge package (which included a gauge that monitored fuel economy, due in part to growing demands for fuel economy as well as a <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge)</b> and intermittent wipers.|$|E
2500|$|Interiors on the Torino {{were all}} new for 1970. The {{dashboard}} featured a linear style speedometer {{centered on the}} driver, and a new [...] "ribbon" [...] style tachometer was an option for V8 models. A <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> was the only available gauge; oil pressure and electrics were monitored with warning lights only. High back bucket seats were available for all 2-door models, as was an optional console; the GT model {{no longer had the}} former as standard features. All 2-door hardtop, SportsRoof and convertible models featured [...] "DirectAire" [...] ventilation systems as a standard feature, which eliminated the need for side vent windows. The 2-door sedan, 4-doors and station wagons still had vent windows, and the [...] "DirectAire" [...] system was an option for these models.

The Corsa came standard with an instrument panel featuring a [...] speedometer with resettable trip odometer, a 6,000rpm tachometer, cylinder head <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge,</b> analog clock with a sweeping second hand, a manifold vacuum/pressure gauge and fuel gauge. A much better heater system, larger brakes borrowed from the Chevelle, a stronger differential ring gear, a Delcotron alternator (replacing the generator), and significant chassis refinements were made. Out back, a new fully articulated rear suspension virtually eliminated {{the danger of the}} previous generation's swing axles, and was based on the contemporary Corvette Sting Ray (Corvair used coil springs while the Sting Ray uses a transverse leaf). [...] AM/FM stereo radio, in-dash All Weather Air Conditioning, telescopically adjustable steering column, and a Special Purpose Chassis Equipment ("Z17") handling package, consisting of a special performance suspension and quick ratio steering box, were significant new options for 1965. [...] The Monza and Corvair 500 Sport Sedans were the only compact cars ever available in the U.S. as pillarless four door hardtops.|$|E

2500|$|As {{fuel economy}} became a bigger {{priority}} among Americans following the Arab Oil Embargo of late 1973 and early 1974, Chevy made the smaller [...] small block V8 with two-barrel carburetor standard on all Caprice models except wagons for 1975. In California, the four-barrel [...] 350 V8 was the base engine and this engine was unavailable elsewhere. Optional engines included the [...] small block V8 (standard on wagons) and [...] big block, the last {{was not available}} in California. All engines except for the 454 were single exhaust systems {{with the introduction of}} the catalytic converter. Station wagons that used the 454 now featured dual exhaust as well. Also introduced this year were GM's [...] "High Energy" [...] electronic ignition and radial tires that were advertised as part of [...] "Chevrolet's New Efficiency System." [...] The theme of economy continued through to the new options this year: A new [...] "Econominder" [...] gauge package included a <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge</b> and a [...] "fuel econominder", the second being a gauge alerting drivers as to when their driving habits caused the engine to use more or less fuel.

2500|$|In 1981, {{there was}} only one {{powerplant}} available, a [...] engine that, like the L-48 base engine the previous year, produced the , but was now designated the L81. The motor was certified in all states and available with manual or automatic transmissions. Chrome air cleaner lids and cast magnesium valve covers dressed up all engines. The stainless steel exhaust manifolds and computer control system introduced on the [...] California engines the previous year were now standard, as was an auxiliary electric engine cooling fan. This, the last C3 available with a manual transmission, so equipped, had a published 0-60mph in 8.1seconds. This model year was the first corvette to use a fiberglass rear leaf spring, now a Corvette trademark. The spring saved thirty-six pounds, but was limited to base suspensions with automatic transmission. When equipped with Delco's brand new optional ETR (Electronically Tuned Receiver) radio with a digital clock, the quartz analog instrument panel clock was replaced with an oil <b>temperature</b> <b>gauge.</b> The cast aluminum wheels, optional since ’76, were now ordered on 90 percent of the cars at a cost of $428.
