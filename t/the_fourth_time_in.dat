5|$|In March, Lee {{lost in the}} All England Open when {{he bowed}} out {{in the second game}} after {{receiving}} medical help on three occasions. This also dashed Lee's hopes of becoming the first man to win three successive All England Open titles. In April, he was defeated by South Korean Shon Wan-ho in the final of the India Open, but retained his Malaysia Open Grand Prix Gold title for <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> a row in May.

5|$|In {{the naval}} Battle of Thurii, Tarentum appealed for {{military}} aid to Pyrrhus, ruler of Epirus. Motivated by his diplomatic obligations to Tarentum, and a personal desire for military accomplishment, Pyrrhus landed a Greek army of some 25,000 men and a contingent of war elephants on Italian soil in 280 BC, where his forces were joined by some Greek colonists and {{a portion of the}} Samnites who revolted against Roman control, taking up arms against Rome for <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> seventy years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the volcano}} {{disaster}} movie The Devil at 4 O'Clock (1961), Tracy played a priest for <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> his career. His co-star, Frank Sinatra, ceded top-billing to guarantee Tracy for the picture. Continuing his pattern of indecisiveness, Tracy briefly {{pulled out of}} the production before recommitting. Critics were unenthusiastic about the film, which was nevertheless Tracy's most successful box office outing since Father of the Bride.|$|E

5|$|On {{the ensuing}} Tech possession, Tech's quarterback {{continued}} to play poorly. On the third play following the kickoff, Glennon was intercepted for <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the game. The downfield interception set up Georgia at their own 11-yard line. Georgia rushed the ball three times, forcing Virginia Tech to use twotimeouts {{in order to stop}} the clock. The punt by Georgia's Ely-Kelso was poorly done, and traveled only 15yards before going out of bounds.|$|E
5|$|There were fears Iginla {{would again}} hold out after his {{contract}} expired following the season. They were unfounded, however, as {{he signed a}} two-year, $13 million deal before the season and was looked on to again lead the Flames offensively. Iginla fell back to 67points in 2002–03 as injuries, including a lingering finger dislocation following a fight, diminished his play. His 35 goals were still enough to lead the Flames for <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> five seasons. Despite his offensive contributions, the Flames missed the playoffs.|$|E

In an April 2009 match with Juventus where he scored Inter's only goal in a 1–1 draw, Balotelli was racially abused by Juventus fans throughout the game. This led Inter owner Massimo Moratti {{to say that he}} would have pulled the team off the pitch had he been present. The racist chants were also condemned by Juventus chairman Giovanni Cobolli Gigli and Juventus were given a one-game home-fan ban because of the incident. Inter won Serie A for <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> a row.|$|E
