5|$|About {{the time}} of the {{completion}} of the Alaska Railroad {{and the beginning of the}} dredging era in Fairbanks, Alaska's aviation industry began <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> first airplane flight in Alaska took place in Fairbanks on July 4, 1913, when a barnstormer flew from a field south of town. The aircraft had been crated and sent from Seattle via Skagway and Whitehorse. The pilot subsequently tried to sell the aircraft, but had no takers. Alaska's first commercial aircraft didn't arrive until June 1923, when Noel Wien began flying a Curtiss JN-4 on mail routes between Fairbanks and isolated communities. From Fairbanks, Wien became the first person to fly to Anchorage and cross the Arctic Circle in an airplane.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player has <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> runway at an Allied base. Afterwards they can fly around and look for enemies to engage. The player can open their Satellite Intelligence Map, which shows a live map of the {{immediate}} coastline with items of interest, such as, friendly bases, enemy positions, and refuelling locations. The player can perform various flight manoeuvres and stunts mid-air, such are loops, rolls, or dummy stalls. Flying, especially at high altitudes, spends the plane's fuel and the player must either return to their base or perform an aerial refueling. To refuel mid-air, the player has to rendezvous with a refuelling plane at the specified coordinates and perform a boom and receptacle refuelling manoeuvre.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{her four}} funnels were removed, and the forward two were cut {{at an angle}} to {{resemble}} those of a German destroyer. The bow was packed with 4.5 tons of high explosives, which were set in concrete. It was decided that the explosive charge would be timed to detonate after the raiders had left the harbour. To prevent the Germans towing her away, the crew would open the ship's seacocks before abandoning the ship. Should she become disabled or sunk before getting to the dock, four motor launches had been detailed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> crew and put the commandos ashore. The charge would be reset to explode after the last boat had left.|$|E

5|$|Prinz Adalbert {{went into}} {{service as a}} gunnery {{training}} vessel for the fleet after her commissioning, while Friedrich Carl served with the cruiser division of the battle fleet. In 1909, Friedrich Carl joined her sister ship as a training vessel, {{being used as a}} torpedo training ship. The two ships were re-mobilized after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914. Both ships were assigned to Admiral Behring's cruiser squadron in the Baltic Sea, with Friedrich Carl serving as his flagship. The squadron was based in Neufahrwasser in Danzig. Behring was ordered to undertake actions against the Russian port of Libau, which was believed to be acting as a staging area for British submarines. On the first assault on the port, on 17 November 1914, Friedrich Carl struck a pair of Russian naval mines off Memel. The ship's crew managed to keep the cruiser afloat long enough to allow nearby vessels <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> entire crew; only seven men were killed in the attack. The operation proceeded as planned, however, and several blockships were sunk in the harbor entrance.|$|E
5|$|The General Staff {{issued an}} order to attack the Egyptian {{positions}} with a force three battalions strong (from the Givati and Palmach's Negev brigades). The attack was meant to {{take place on the}} night of June 1–2, and at about midnight the units involved took up positions from which the assault was meant <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> 51st Battalion set up positions in the Yavne–Gan Yavne–Hatzor area, the 53rd Battalion—in the Be'er Tuvia–Kfar Warburg area, and the 54th entered a company into the Gedera–Bashit area. At the last minute, the General Staff cancelled the order because of an imminent ceasefire. The ceasefire did not take effect however, and the attack was postponed to the night of June 2–3. The Egyptians discovered the original plan, and were prepared to engage the Israeli forces.|$|E
5|$|Carpender was not inflexible, {{and reached}} a {{compromise}} with Mackay to transport a battalion to Finschhafen in high speed transports (APDs). Herring was in Dobodura, lunching with Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell, {{when he heard}} this news. He decided to fly to Milne Bay {{to discuss the matter}} of resupply in general with Barbey. On 28 September, Herring and two of his staff officers, Brigadiers R. B. Sutherland and R. Bierwirth, boarded a U.S. Fifth Air Force B-25 Mitchell bomber at Dobodura. As the plane was about <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> undercarriage collapsed and the plane ploughed into the Marston Mat runway. A propeller shattered, splinters ripped through the fuselage into the cabin and Sutherland, who was sitting in the navigator's compartment next to Herring, was struck by a flying fragment that killed him instantly. The crew, Herring and Bierwirth escaped shaken but unscathed. The trip to Milne Bay was cancelled. Brigadier Sutherland was buried with full military honours at Soputa the next day, with a fly past by B-25s. When next he flew, Herring once again took a B-25 and made a point of requesting the major who had been in charge of the crashed plane to be his pilot.|$|E

All the major department stores and shoe stores had booths set up to give the arriving survivors clothing and shoes. Not many of the newspeople spoke Italian, so confusion occurred when the survivors were asked <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> clothing they were just given, to be photographed putting the clothes on. But {{after just a few}} minutes, everyone was clothed and had shoes to wear.|$|E
25|$|On 28 August 1993 a non-scheduled {{domestic}} passenger flight operated by Tajik Air and {{served by a}} Yakovlev Yak-40 crashed during takeoff at Khorog Airport, killing 82 people on board (including 14 children). Militants {{during the civil war}} in Tajikistan forced the crew to take more passengers than the aircraft was able to carry, which led to an excess takeoff weight. Unable <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> aircraft overran the runway at high speed, struck several obstacles and fell into the Panj River.|$|E

This route which runs from north-west to south-east of Kuala Lumpur is densely populated and is currently inadequately served by rail-based public transport. Upon expected completion by 2016, the Sungai Buloh – Kajang line will provide service to 1.2 million people with an estimated daily ridership of 442,000.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the tenth}} century, Prince Vladimir Svyatoslavich, then ruling over Novgorod the Great, {{proposed}} a marriage between himself and the daughter of Rogvolod, the prince of Polotsk, who had rebuffed him, saying she did not want <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> shoes of a slave's son. In retaliation, Vladimir attacked and pillaged Polotsk, killed Rogvolod, and took his daughter Rogneda by force, adding the city to his territorial possessions. He placed his son, Izyaslav, in Polotsk. Iziaslav's son, Bryachislav of Polotsk, succeeded his father in 1001.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} departed Sweden {{and headed}} for Spain. At 11:30 the pilot ask to land at Madrid–Barajas Airport. The aircraft landed and was surrounded by 200 police officers. An English-speaking technician, a Norwegian SAS employee and the airport's director were let aboard the aircraft, where they negotiated {{the release of the}} crew. After it was made clear that the Spanish authorities would not allow the plane <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> hijackers surrendered at 14:47. When the aircraft was stormed and the hijackers arrested, the Spanish military police took care of the two bags of money. However, {{by the end of the}} action some of the money was not accounted for.|$|E
25|$|At 11:30, Tyrwhitt's {{squadron}} {{came upon}} another German cruiser, Mainz and the ships engaged for 20 minutes, {{before the arrival}} of Goodenough caused Mainz to attempt an escape. Goodenough gave chase and in trying to lose him, Mainz came back across the path of Arethusa and her destroyers. Her steering was damaged, causing her to turn back into the path of Goodenough's ships and she was hit by shells and torpedo. At 12:20, her captain ordered his ship to be scuttled and the crew to abandon ship. Keyes had now joined the main body of ships and brought Lurcher alongside Mainz <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> crew. Three British destroyers had been seriously damaged in the engagement.|$|E

25|$|It {{is alleged}} that the Akıncı AFB was the command center of the pro-coup military. At 22:00 hours local time on July 15, 2016, Akın Öztürk, a four-star General in the Turkish Air Force {{and a member of}} the Supreme Military Council, who served as the 30th Commander of the Turkish Air Force between 2013 and 2015, {{reportedly}} started the coup d'état in Ankara by ordering of F-16 jet fighters of the 141st squadron <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> operation was led by Air Pilot Staff Lieutenant colonel Hakan Karakuş, who is the son-in-law of Akın Öztürk.

25|$|The RAF {{units in}} Burma moved to Arakan on 24 October. Intelligence {{suggested}} the Japanese army would strike {{up the coast}} of Burma to reach India. The Japanese began their first Arakan campaign in December 1942. On 25 October Carey was created with one Ki-43 destroyed in a rare instance of air combat. In {{the evening of the}} 26 October Carey was sitting in the cockpit refuelling near Cox's Bazar aerodrome when 27 Ki-43s swept overhead. In {{the heat of the moment}} Carey decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> Japanese sighted the Hurricane and Carey began manoeuvres to present an awkward target. Carey headed away from Japanese lines and eventually, after a long chase, they broke off for want of fuel and Carey landed without incident, having not been hit by enemy fire.|$|E
25|$|In late 1961, the Indian {{government}} decided {{to attach the}} Portuguese colony of Goa after years of disagreement between New Delhi and Lisbon. The Indian Air Force was requested to provide support elements to the ground force in what was called Operation Vijay. Probing flights by some fighters and bombers were carried out from 8–18 December to draw out the Portuguese Air Force, but to no avail. On 18 December, two waves of Canberra bombers bombed the runway of Dabolim airfield {{taking care not to}} bomb the Terminals and the ATC tower. Two Portuguese transport aircraft (a Super Constellation and a DC-6) found on the airfield were left alone so that they could be captured intact. However the Portuguese pilots managed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> aircraft from the still damaged airfield and made their getaway to Portugal. Hunters attacked the wireless station at Bambolim. Vampires were used to provide air support to the ground forces. In Daman, Mystères were used to strike Portuguese gun positions. Ouragans (called Toofanis in the IAF) bombed the runways at Diu and destroyed the control tower, wireless station and the meteorological station. After the Portuguese surrendered the former colony was integrated into India.|$|E

25|$|Adolfo Tapia {{made his}} {{professional}} wrestling debut in 1982 {{at the age}} of 16, using his real name. Later on he would wrestle as the masked El Gringo in the Monclova, Coahuila region and as El Minero in Mexico City. Tapia lost his first Lucha de Apuesta, or bet match, to Climax II and was forced <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> El Minero mask and reveal his real name, as per Lucha libre traditions. In 1988 he changed his ring character to El Asesino de Tepito ("The Assassin from Tepito"), a rudo (villain) character he used in 1988. He lost the Asesino de Tepito mask in an Apuesta match against Astro de Oro at some point in 1988. Following the mask loss Tapia adopted a character called Principe Island ("Island Prince"), a character he would use until 1992. As Principe Island he won the masks of wrestlers Gran Cóndor, Principe Judas, Guerrero Negra and Bestia Negra I. On November 21, 1987 he lost the Principe Island mask to El Hijo del Santo. Following his mask loss he started working as the masked Invasor del Norte I as well as still taking bookings as Principe Island. The double bookings came to an end on June 26, 1991 when Stuka unmasked the Invasor del Norte character, revealing that Tapia played both characters.|$|E
25|$|In both sports, {{strategy}} {{varies with}} the game situation. In baseball, pitcher, batter and fielders all play far differently in the late innings of a close game (e.g., waiting for walks, trying for stolen bases or the squeeze play to score a decisive run) than they do early, or when one team has already scored many more runs than the other (where batters will be likely to swing at many more pitches and try for extra-base hits and even home runs). The number, speed, and position of baserunners, which have no equivalent in cricket, all dramatically change the strategies used by pitcher and batter. A runner on first base must decide how large a lead <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> base—the larger the lead, the greater the chance of advancing on a stolen base or batted ball, but also the greater {{the risk of being}} picked off by the pitcher. In leagues which do not allow designated hitters, strategic thinking also enters into substitutions. For example, in the double switch, the substitution of a relief pitcher is combined with the substitution of a pinch hitter who takes the pitcher's spot in the batting order so that the new pitcher will come to bat later (as almost all pitchers are poor hitters much like most specialist bowlers are poor batsmen). Since players may not return to the game after being substituted for, a manager cannot take lightly the decision when and if to substitute a better-fielding but worse-hitting player if his team is ahead.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1807 I was on board of the ship Canton, {{belonging}} to my uncle, the late Hugh Thompson, of Baltimore, when we fell in, at sea, near the termination of a very heavy equinoctial gale, with an English brig in a sinking condition, and took off the crew. The brig was loaded with codfish, and was bound to Pole, in England, from Newfoundland. I boarded her, in command of a boat from the Canton, which was sent <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> English crew, the brig's own boats having been all swept away, and her crew {{in a state of}} intoxication. I found onboard of her two Newfoundland pups, male and female, which I saved, and subsequently, on our landing the English crew at Norfolk, our own destination being Baltimore, I purchased these two pups of the English captain for a guinea apiece. Being bound again to sea, I gave the dog pup, which was called Sailor, to Mr. John Mercer, of West River; and the slut pup, which was called Canton, to Doctor James Stewart, of Sparrow's Point. The history which the English captain gave me of these pups was, that the owner of his brig was extensively engaged in the Newfoundland trade, and had directed his correspondent to select and send him a pair of pups of the most approved Newfoundland breed, but of different families, and that the pair I purchased of him were selected under this order. The dog was of a dingy red colour; and the slut black. They were not large; their hair was short, but very thick-coated; they had dew claws. Both attained great reputation as water-dogs. They were most sagacious in every thing, particularly so in all duties connected with duck-shooting. Governor Lloyd exchanged a Merino ram for the dog, {{at the time of the}} Merino fever, when such rams were selling for many hundred dollars, and took him over to his estate on the eastern shore of Maryland, where his progeny were well known for many years after; and may still be known there, and on the western shore, as the Sailor breed. The slut remained at Sparrows Point till her death, and her progeny were and are still well known, through Patapsco Neck, on the Gunpowder, and up the bay, amongst the duck-shooters, as unsurpassed for their purposes. I have heard both Doctor Stewart and Mr. Mercer relate most extraordinary instances of the sagacity and performance of both dog and slut, and would refer you to their friends for such particulars as I am unable, at this distance of time, to recollect with sufficient accuracy to repeat.|$|E
