25|$|The {{state of}} obesity clearly {{contributes}} to insulin resistance, {{which in turn}} can cause type 2 diabetes. Virtually all obese and most <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetic</b> individuals have marked insulin resistance. Although the association between overweight and insulin resistance is clear, the exact (likely multifarious) causes of insulin resistance remain less clear. It {{is important to note}} that it has been demonstrated that appropriate exercise, more regular food intake, and reducing glycemic load (see below) all can reverse insulin resistance in overweight individuals (and thereby lower their blood sugar level, in those with type 2 diabetes).|$|E

40|$|Summary:Thyroid {{dysfunction}} {{complicates the}} metabolic derangement observed in Diabetes Mellitus (DM). It {{is necessary to}} recognize and treat it when present {{in order to achieve}} stability of metabolic control in these patients. The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in type- <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> in our environment is not known. This study was therefore designed to determine the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in <b>Type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> seen at the Metabolic Research Unit of University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria. Serum TSH, Free T 3 & Free T 4 assays were performed using Automated Enzyme Immunoassay platform on fresh sera from volunteers comprising 64 adult <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> and 36, age matched, non diabetic controls; weight, height and blood pressures were measured in all subjects. In addition, past lipid profile results of <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> were retrieved from medical records. Thyroid dysfunction was present in 19 (29. 7 %) of 64 <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> and 1 (<b>2.</b> 8 %) of 36 non diabetic controls (P< 0. 05). The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction is 32. 4 % in females and 25. 9 % in males. Secondary hypothyroidism was seen in 78. 9 %, sub-clinical hypothyroidism in 15. 8 %, and sub-clinical hyperthyroidism 5. 2 % of subjects with thyroid dysfunction. Abnormal lipid profiles were seen in 35. 4 % of euthyroid <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> and 100 % of hypothyroid <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> (P< 0. 05). 87. 5 % of <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> and 38. 8 % of controls were hypertensive (P< 0. 05). 7. 8 % of <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> and 50 % of controls were obese (P< 0. 05). The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in <b>type</b> <b>2</b> is higher in <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> than in controls. More of <b>Type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> were obese and more of them were hypertensive compared to controls. The approach of using TSH first in screening for thyroid dysfunction is not sufficient in <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics.</b> Routine screening for thyroid dysfunction should be carried out in <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics...</b>|$|R

Methods: A cross sectional analytical study conducted on patients with <b>type</b> <b>2</b> diabetes mellitus during 2004 at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center Karachi. Study population included 75 patients of <b>type</b> <b>2</b> diabetes mellitus (50 men, 25 women) from diabetic clinic Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center Karachi 25 non diabetics (15 men, 10 women) from general population as control.

Patients having clinical albuminuria and with other causes of proteinuria were excluded. Results: Albumin excretion was highly significant (p< 0. 001) in smoker <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> as compared to smoker non diabetics. Similarly, albuminuria was increased (p< 0. 001) in smoker <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> in comparison with non smoker <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics.</b> A significant correlation was found between years of smoking and albuminuria (r= 0. 448, p< 0. 05) in smoker <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics.</b> Conclusion: Albumin excretion correlates with smoking in <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics.</b> Key words: <b>Type</b> <b>2</b> diabetes mellitus, Albuminuria, Smokin...|$|R

Later can be measured by simple 5 min heart rate variability (HRV) using simple electrocardiogram, which if reduced indicates cardiac risk. ObjectiveWe compared HRV parameters between hypertensive and normotensive <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics,</b> looking for significant difference if any. Materials and methods 98 hypertensive and 40 normotensive <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> treated as outpatients were evaluated {{for disease control and}} risk stratification. 5 min resting HRV was measured by Variowin HR, software based instrument, using standard protocols to record time domain, frequency domain and Poincare plot parameters. They were compared between groups for difference with p< 0. 05 defining statistical significance. ResultsMean age was 56 and 51 years, duration 6 years and 4 years respectively in hypertensive (HT) and normotensive (NT) group of <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics,</b> which did not significantly differ in distribution of risk factors. There was poor glycaemic control (one third only) in both groups and good pressure control in HT group.

ConclusionOur findings of HRV suggest that in <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> with poor glycaemic and good pressure control, hypertension as a co-existing factor does not make significant difference in cardiac dysautonomia emphasizing residual risk despite antihypertensive treatment and need for early HRV screening, strict glycaemic control and other interventions...|$|R

40|$|Background: Deranged {{body fat}} and muscle mass are aftermaths of {{uncontrolled}} diabetes. Anthropometric methods like {{body mass index}} (BMI) do not give qualitative inferences like total body fat (TBF), visceral fat (VF) or subcutaneous fat (SF) that can be given by bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA). We studied body composition of <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> in comparison to controls matched by age-sex, weight and BMI separately. Methods: Seventy-eight under-treatment <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> of either sex with known glycemic and lipidemic control and equal number of controls with three patterns of matching were taken from our city. We derived parameters of body composition in both groups by Omron Karada Scan (Model HBF- 510, China), using the principle of tetra poplar BIA and compared them for statistical significance. Results: We found significantly more SF (30. 47 % ± 7. 73 %), VF (11. 94 % ± 4. 97 %) and TBF (33. 96 % ± 6. 07 %) and significantly lesser skeletal muscle mass (23. 39 % ± 4. 49 %) in <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> as compared to controls, persisting even after matching with weight or BMI. On assessing qualitatively, the risk of high VF, high TBF, low skeletal muscle mass was significantly high in <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics,</b> which were 10. 41, 3. 01, 9. 21 respectively for comparable BMI and 6. 78, 3. 51, 11. 93 respectively for comparable weight. Conclusions: BIA reveals that <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> have more ectopic fat on the expense of skeletal muscle that persists even after matching by weight or BMI, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Measurement of body composition can be included as a primary care strategy to motivate lifestyle modifications while managing metabolic derangements of <b>type</b> <b>2</b> diabetes...|$|R

In random order, they drank equienergetic preloads of glucose (75 g) (GLUC), fructose (75 g) (FRUCT) or vehicle (300 mL water with noncaloric flavoring [VEH]) 3 hours before an ad libitum buffet lunch. Mean glucose concentrations were lower after FRUCT than GLUC in both <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> (FRUCT v GLUC: 7. 5 +/- 0. 3 v 10. 8 +/- 0. 4 mmol/L, P. 05). Glucose, but not FRUC, increased GIP concentrations, which were not different between <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> and nondiabetics (P >. 05). Food intake was suppressed 14 % by GLUC (P. 05). We have confirmed that oral fructose ingestion produces a lower postprandial blood glucose response than equienergetic glucose and demonstrated that (1) fructose produces greater increases in plasma insulin concentration in <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> than nondiabetics, not apparently due to greater plasma incretin concentrations and (2) fructose and glucose have equivalent short-term satiating efficiency in both <b>type</b> <b>2</b> <b>diabetics</b> and nondiabetics.
