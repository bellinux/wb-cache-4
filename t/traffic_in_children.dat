50|$|In some countries, {{children}} can be imprisoned for common crimes. In some countries, like Iran or China, criminals can even be sentenced to capital punishment for crimes committed while they were children (the United States abandoned the practice in 2005). In contexts where military use of children is made, they also risk being prisoners of war. Other children are forced to prostitution, exploited by adults for illegal <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>children</b> or endangered by poverty and hunger. Infanticide today continues {{at a much higher}} rate in areas of extremely high poverty and overpopulation, such as parts of China and India. Female infants, then and even now, are particularly vulnerable, a factor in sex-selective infanticide.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} five years, Americans have adopted nearly seventy {{thousand}} children from foreign countries. The trend of intercountry adoption, “the process by which a married couple or single individual of one country adopts a child from another country,” {{is representative of the}} new globalized world, where families are formed and dissolved beyond the bounds of national borders. Although intercountry adoption has enabled many adoptive parents to form loving families and provide caring living environments for countless children, intercountry adoption is not without its share of problems. Corruption and abuse, such as child trafficking, have in many cases marred the process of intercountry adoption. These impediments to safe intercountry adoption led the international community to pass the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption in 1993. By signing the Convention, countries agree to “ensure that intercountry adoptions are made {{in the best interest of}} the child and with respect for his or her fundamental rights, and to prevent the abduction, the sale of, or <b>traffic</b> <b>in</b> <b>children.</b> ” The Convention requires its members, who have signed and ratified the treaty, to follow certain protocols and procedures for intercountry adoptions between two countries that are members to the Convention. However, the Convention does not prohibit member countries from engaging in intercountry adoptions with nonmember countries. Thus, although the United States officially joined the Convention on December 12, 2007, and the Convention’s rules went into effect on April 1, 2008, the United States still allows intercountry adoptions from countries that are nonmembers to the Convention. This Comment will examine the Convention in the context of intercountry adoption in the United States. Specifically, this Comment will focus on the effect that permitting the United States to continue intercountry adoption with nonmember countries has on attaining the Convention’s goals. This Comment will argue that to effectuate the goals of the Convention, the United States must encourage nonmember countries to join the Convention and must eventually cease intercountry adoptions with nonmember countries that refuse to join. But to promote the best interests of the prospective adoptive children in nonmember countries, such a cessation must be done through a long-term, structured withdrawal, allowing nonmember countries time to develop their adoption infrastructure...|$|E

The question of the existence of a rule on the level of international customary law consisting in the prohibition of <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> women and <b>children</b> is especially significant. The problem of <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> women and <b>children</b> is a multi- dimensional issue encompassing more subsystems of international law, which gives rise to a question of the relation of the respective subsystems. The human rights law and criminal law approach complement each other in international legal instruments which deal with <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> women and <b>children</b> when their deficiencies are compensated for by the strengths of the other subsystem. The thesis is divided into two parts. The first part presents the introduction into the problem of <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> women and <b>children.</b> This part explains the relation between the analysed problem and related phenomenon, clarifies key words used in the thesis, defines actors engaged in the process of <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> women and <b>children</b> and finally deals with factors which exercise influence on the enormous rise of <b>trafficking</b> <b>in</b> women and <b>children</b> <b>in</b> the present-day [...] ...|$|R
