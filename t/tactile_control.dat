50|$|Vinyl {{emulation}} software {{allows the}} user to physically manipulate the playback of digital audio files on a computer using the turntables as an interface, thus preserving the hands-on control and feel of DJing with vinyl. This has the added advantage of using turntables to play back audio recordings not available in phonograph form. This method allows DJs to scratch, beatmatch, and perform other turntablism that would be impossible with a conventional keyboard-and-mouse computer interface or less <b>tactile</b> <b>control</b> devices. The technology is also mainly referred to as DVS for Digital Vinyl System.|$|E
50|$|Both the PC and Xbox {{versions}} of the game are relatively easy to play, with conventional and reconfigurable shooter-style controls. The first mission is an interactive tutorial that guides the player through a typical robbery, set in an Inn. The player may save progress at any point, and must do so manually from time to time, since the game never autosaves. The Xbox version has considerably more <b>tactile</b> <b>controls</b> since it uses a game controller instead of an all purpose keyboard. Within the lock-picking minigame, a rumble effect can be felt based on {{the relation between the}} lock picks and tumblers. Movement of the right analog stick also allows Garrett to turn his head while picking locks, allowing the player to survey their surroundings and pick locks simultaneously. Moving the left analog stick gently makes Garrett creep, and forcefully makes him run.|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper {{presents}} a novel interface system to aid people {{with visual impairment}} to become proficient with operating unfamiliar devices. The system works by adding touch sensors that trigger audio tags to <b>tactile</b> <b>controls.</b> The touch sensors trigger the audio tags before the control is activated. Design/methodology/approach – The paper describes how several devices were enhanced with the new technology, tested and evaluated. Initial informational interviewing with visually impaired people was followed by user studies with blindfolded but visually able people. A final evaluation of the system was conducted by a visually impaired group. Findings – This paper shows that the technology is of benefit to a visually impaired user when using a complex unfamiliar device. Originality/value – This novel application of touch sensors coupled with audio tags {{has the potential to}} benefit visually impaired people. This technology can easily be incorporated into commercial devices. The idea can also be implemented using off the shelf development boards coupled with smart phones...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{consumers}} {{to anticipate the}} value they will draw from new product generations that expand the capabilities of incumbent goods is explored. Drawing on previous research in affective forecasting, the work explores a hypothesis that consumers will frequently overestimate the benefits they envision drawing from new added product features and underestimate the learning costs required to realize those benefits. This hypothesis is tested using a computer simulation in which subjects are trained to play a Pacman- like arcade game where icons are moved over a screen by different forms of <b>tactile</b> <b>controls.</b> Respondents are then given the option to play a series of games for money with an incumbent game platform or pay to play with an alternative version that offer either expanded (Experiments 1 and 2) or simplified (Experiment 3) sets of controls. As hypothesized, subjects displayed an upwardly-biased valuation of the new sets of controls as measured by actual versus forecasted usage rates and performance gains. Yet, when {{given the opportunity to}} be paid to trade down to a more efficient device in exchange, few accepted. We thus observe a paradox where the presence of forecasting mistakes in product adoptions does little to induce regret in ownership...|$|R
50|$|In {{the domain}} of digital audio, a control surface is a human {{interface}} device (HID) which allows the user to control a digital audio workstation or other digital audio application. Generally, a control surface will contain one or more controls that can be assigned to parameters in the software, allowing <b>tactile</b> <b>control</b> of the software. As digital audio software is complex and can play any number of functions in the audio chain, control surfaces {{can be used to}} control many aspects of music production, including virtual instruments, samplers, signal processors, mixers, console automation, DJ software, and sequencer applications.|$|E

50|$|Digidesign/Avid control {{surfaces}} attempt {{to bridge the}} gap between old-style analog desks and modern DAWs by providing physical controls for the Pro Tools software. These include the C|24, a 24-fader surface with 16 built-in pre-amps, and the ICON: Integrated Console Environment, combining a <b>tactile</b> <b>control</b> surface and a Pro Tools|HD Accel system in one unit. VENUE, a similar system, was released for live-sound applications. The Command|8 is a smaller eight-fader control surface. Pro Tools compatible {{control surfaces}} have also been developed by other companies. For example, the Audient ASP2802 has integrated DAW control, and is compatible with Pro Tools as well as Logic Pro and Cubase. It therefore provides an external analog mixing interface for the computer. In April 2010, Avid acquired Euphonix, a manufacturer of high quality control surfaces.|$|E
40|$|Auditory {{display is}} an often underutilized {{interface}} modality for conveying {{information to a}} user. However, audio has previously proven effective {{in a variety of}} use cases for information presentation and is particularly effective when the user is unable to attend to a visual interface, whether from a disability or a temporary constraint such as vehicle operation. In addition to auditory representations of data (sonifications), audio {{can also be used to}} represent a list of commands or menu within an interface. This thesis presents a concept for auditory menus that minimizes responses/inputs by the user as well as the number of <b>tactile</b> <b>controls</b> necessary. Such types of menus therefore limit simultaneous manual interactions when the user is also engaged with another demanding motor task. This approach to auditory menu interaction is referred to as a push menu and can be thought of as an alternative to more conventional auditory menus, which are referred to as pull menus. Push menus present menus in an automated sequence during which the user recognizes the desired menu item and makes a selection within a selection interval. In contrast, pull menus require that the user navigate via a combination of multiple navigation inputs and item selections. In this thesis a general hypothesis is presented that predicts that a primary visual-motor task, such as operating a vehicle, will be less negatively impacted by the secondary task of auditory menu interaction when the menu is a push menu rather than a pull menu.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{consumers}} to optimally anticipate the value they will draw from new product {{features that are}} introduced to enhance the performance of existing technologies is explored. The work tests a hypothesis that when consumers are {{given the opportunity to}} buy a new generation of a products that offers enhanced features consumer will overvalue them, a bias the accrues to a tendency to overestimate both the extent that they will utilize these new features and the impact they will have on utility. This general hypothesis is tested {{in the context of a}} computer simulation in which subjects are trained to play one three different forms of an arcade game where icons are moved over a screen by different forms of <b>tactile</b> <b>controls.</b> Respondents are then given the option to play a series of games for money with either with their incumbent game platform or pay to play with an alternative version that offered an expanded set of controls. As hypothesized, subjects displayed an upwardly-biased valuation for the new sets of controls; adopters underutilized them and displayed a level of game performance that was not better than those who never upgraded. A follow-up study designed to resolve the process underlying the bias indicated that while adopters indeed over-forecast the degree to which they would make use of the new control, they did not over-forecast performance gains. Hence, the key driver of adoption decisions appeared to be an exaggerated belief of the hedonic pleasure that would be derived from owning and utilizing the new control as opposed to any objective value it might provide...|$|R

5000|$|Music {{software}} development {{dates back to}} the 1960s and 70s. While this software was at best primitive, it nonetheless helped lay the foundation for the future development of the software and synthetic musical production. The early music software was run on large computers at several universities such as Stanford and Penn State. Much of what development came to music software came {{as a result of the}} continuous improvement to computers over time. Chain of development is seen clearly in 1978 when nearly 50 music programs came out as a result of MIDI technology, a form of computer communication still used today. MIDI technology provided the key link in hardware for musical software, giving a person a <b>tactile</b> <b>control</b> of an instrument and playing directly into the software in the computer and allowing for maximum control of the production. [...] Fourth generation music software came out in the early 1990s. The largest improvement with this software was the addition of more detailed displays allowing the music software to show more on the screen making the program much easier to use and understand.An important recent development is to automatically transcribe performed music directly to sheet music as developed by ScoreCloud. Today, there are different music making software like DrDrum Beat Maker which are attracting users and helping users to create amazing music without any experience.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{goal of this}} {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI) study was to compare the central effects of electroacupuncture at different frequencies with traditional Chinese manual acupuncture. Although not as time-tested as manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture does have the advantage of setting stimulation frequency and intensity objectively and quantifiably. Manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture at 2 Hz and 100 Hz, and <b>tactile</b> <b>control</b> stimulation were carried out at acupoint ST- 36. Overall, electroacupuncture (particularly at low frequency) produced more widespread fMRI signal increase than manual acupuncture did, and all acupuncture stimulations produced more widespread responses than did our placebo-like <b>tactile</b> <b>control</b> stimulation. Acupuncture produced hemodynamic signal increase in the anterior insula, and decrease in limbic and paralimbic structures including the amygdala, anterior hippocampus, and the cortices of the subgenual and retrosplenial cingulate, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, frontal, and temporal poles, results not seen for <b>tactile</b> <b>control</b> stimulation. Only electroacupuncture produced significant signal increase in the anterior middle cingulate cortex, whereas 2 -Hz electroacupuncture produced signal increase in the pontine raphe area. All forms of stimulation (acupuncture and control) produced signal increase in SII. These findings support a hypothesis that the limbic system is central to acupuncture effect regardless of specific acupuncture modality, although some differences do exist in the underlying neurobiologic mechanisms for these modalities, and may aid in optimizing their future usage in clinical applications.

40|$|Event-related {{potential}} (ERP) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) employ {{differences in}} brain responses to attended and ignored stimuli. When using a tactile ERP-BCI for navigation, mapping is required between navigation directions on a visual display and unambiguously corresponding tactile stimuli (tactors) from a <b>tactile</b> <b>control</b> device: control-display mapping (CDM). We investigated {{the effect of}} congruent (both display and control horizontal or both vertical) and incongruent (vertical display, horizontal control) CDMs on task performance, the ERP and potential BCI performance. Ten participants attended to a target (determined via CDM), in a stream of sequentially vibrating tactors. We show that congruent CDM yields best task performance, enhanced the P 300 and results in increased estimated BCI performance. This suggests a reduced availability of attentional resources when operating an ERP-BCI with incongruent CDM. Additionally, we found an enhanced N 2 for incongruent CDM, which indicates a conflict between visual display and <b>tactile</b> <b>control</b> orientations. Practitioner Summary: Incongruency in control-display mapping reduces task performance. In this study, brain responses, task and system performance are related to (in) congruent mapping of command options and the corresponding stimuli in a brain-computer interface (BCI). Directional congruency reduces task errors, increases available attentional resources, improves BCI performance and thus facilitates human-computer interaction. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the field}} of quality control of products, very few {{applications}} {{make use of the}} sense of touch. Touch involves complex physical phenomena, mainly related to contact and friction. Being able to master this type of product control presupposes the understanding of how the tactile perception of a product is constructed. Moreover, realizing quality control by means of a comparison to a reference is important in order to ensure customer satisfaction. Looking at the tactile descriptors usually proposed, one can observe that these descriptors are generally strongly related to specific products and languages. In addition, they are often intended {{to be used in the}} design process of new products. This paper focuses on the measuring of the tactile sensory perception in a production context. Although the sensory analysis of the customer perception is not the main topic here, the specificities of the <b>tactile</b> <b>control</b> in production detailed in this paper are based on it. In particular, the aim is to guarantee the expected sensory perceptions of the customer, independently from those of the inspectors in charge of product control. This feature induces the need for a new classification of the tactile descriptors to be used in quality control. The paper describes the process of tactile perception by analogy with the process of visual perception which is better formalized. An inventory of the tactile descriptors mentioned in the literature is done and a list of the relevant ones in the context of <b>tactile</b> <b>control</b> of product is proposed. Several methods for the structuring of these descriptors are analyzed, with the focus put on obtaining a very small list of descriptors. Indeed, this is essential in order to reduce the variability of the results usually seen in this type of control. Finally, this paper shows how ontologies can be used, through the representation of these descriptors as well as the relations between them, in order to model the expertise associated with <b>tactile</b> <b>control.</b> The aim of this modelling is to lead to the automation (or semi-automation) of this type of control.
