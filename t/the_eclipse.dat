5|$|Orme (1889 – 17 September 1915) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse. He {{was trained}} at Kingsclere by John Porter for the 1st Duke of Westminster. As a two-year-old {{he won the}} Middle Park and Dewhurst Stakes. As a three-year-old he was not well enough {{to take part in}} the 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby, but came back to win <b>the</b> <b>Eclipse</b> Stakes. Orme stayed in {{training}} as a four-year-old and won another Eclipse Stakes, becoming the first horse to win the race twice, a feat that has only been repeated four times since. After he had retired from racing, he became a successful sire and was Champion sire of Great Britain in 1899. His son Flying Fox won the Triple Crown and <b>the</b> <b>Eclipse</b> Stakes. Orme also sired Epsom Derby winner Orby and 1000 Guineas winner Witch Elm. His regular jockeys were George Barrett and Morny Cannon.|$|E
50|$|J. R.

This motion would create a redshift of <b>the</b> <b>eclipsed</b> star’s spectrum followed by a blueshift, thus appearing as {{a change in the}} radial velocity in addition to that caused by the orbital motion of <b>the</b> <b>eclipsed</b> star.|$|R

5|$|Additionally {{there are}} often {{transient}} phenomena, events which do not happen on an annual cycle. Most predictable are events like eclipses. In the case of solar eclipses these {{can be used to}} date events in the past. A solar eclipse mentioned by Herodotus enables us to date a battle between the Medes and the Lydians, which following <b>the</b> <b>eclipse</b> failed to happen, to 28 May, 585 BC. Other easily calculated events are supernovae whose remains are visible to astronomers and therefore their positions and magnitude can be accurately calculated.|$|E
5|$|Aloy {{was cast}} {{out from the}} Nora tribe at birth, raised by an outcast named Rost (JB Blanc). As a child, she {{obtained}} a Focus, a small augmented reality device that gives her special perceptive abilities. After coming of age, Aloy (Ashly Burch) enters a competition called the Proving to win the right to become a Nora Brave, and by extension, {{a member of the}} Nora tribe. Aloy wins the competition, but the Nora are suddenly attacked by cultists. Aloy is almost killed by their leader Helis (Crispin Freeman), but is saved by Rost, who sacrifices himself to save Aloy from a bomb. When Aloy awakes, a Matriarch explains that the cultists had gained control of corrupted machines. Aloy also learns that as an infant, she was found {{at the foot of a}} sealed door that the Nora worship, and was believed by some to be cursed, hence being cast out. An Oseram foreigner called Olin (Chook Sibtain) informs Aloy that the cultists are part of a fanatical religious group calling themselves <b>the</b> <b>Eclipse.</b> They worship a demon called HADES (John Gonzalez), who allows them to corrupt machines. Olin indicates that the reason Aloy was targeted by <b>the</b> <b>Eclipse</b> was due to her resemblance to an Old World scientist named Dr. Elisabet Sobeck (also voiced by Burch).|$|E
5|$|Borislow's most {{successful}} horse was Toccet, who won four graded stakes, including the Champagne and Hollywood Futurity in 2002. Toccet's {{name is a}} misspelled tribute to former National Hockey League (NHL) player Rick Tocchet. The horse was named runner-up to Vindication for the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt in 2002, a part of <b>the</b> <b>Eclipse</b> Award. Once a favorite to enter the 2003 Kentucky Derby, Toccet was derailed by ankle injuries early in the year. He won one listed stakes after his juvenile season out of 15 starts and now stands at Castleton Lyons.|$|E
40|$|Two very {{different}} quantum mechanically based energy decomposition analyses (EDA) schemes are employed {{to study the}} dominant energy differences between <b>the</b> <b>eclipsed</b> and staggered ferrocene conformers. One is the extended transition state (ETS) based on the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) package {{and the other is}} natural EDA (NEDA) based in the General Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure System (GAMESS) package. It reveals that in addition to the model (theory and basis set), the fragmentation channels more significantly affect the interaction energy terms (DE) between the conformers. It is discovered that such an interaction energy can be absorbed into the pre-partitioned fragment channels so that to affect the interaction energies in a particular conformer of Fc. To avoid this, the present study employs a complete fragment channel-the fragments of ferrocene are individual neutral atoms. It therefore discovers that the major difference between the ferrocene conformers is due to the quantum mechanical Pauli repulsive energy and orbital attractive energy, leading to <b>the</b> <b>eclipsed</b> ferrocene <b>the</b> energy preferred structure. The NEDA scheme further indicates that the sum of attractive (negative) polarization (POL) and charge transfer (CL) energies prefers <b>the</b> <b>eclipsed</b> ferrocene. <b>The</b> repulsive (positive) deformation (DEF) energy, which is dominated by the cyclopentadienyle (Cp) rings, prefers the staggered ferrocene. Again, the cancellation results in a small energy residue in favour of <b>the</b> <b>eclipsed</b> ferrocene, in agreement with the ETS scheme. Further Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis indicates that all NBO energies, total Lewis (no Fe) and lone pair (LP) deletion all prefer <b>the</b> <b>eclipsed</b> Fc conformer. <b>The</b> most significant energy preferring <b>the</b> <b>eclipsed</b> ferrocene without cancellation is the interactions between the donor lone pairs (LP) of the Fe atom and the acceptor antibond (BD*) NBOs of all C&# 8211;C and C&# 8211;H bonds in the ligand, LP(Fe) -BD*(C&# 8211;C & C&# 8211;H), which strongly stabilizes <b>the</b> <b>eclipsed</b> (D 5 h) conformation by 457. 6 kcal mol 1...|$|R

5|$|Eclipses {{can occur}} {{only when the}} Sun is within about 15 to 18 degrees of a node, (10 to 12 degrees for central eclipses). This is {{referred}} to as an eclipse limit. In the time it takes for the Moon to return to a node (draconic month), the apparent position of the Sun has moved about 29 degrees, relative to the nodes. Since <b>the</b> <b>eclipse</b> limit creates a window of opportunity of up to 36 degrees (24 degrees for central eclipses), it is possible for partial eclipses (or rarely a partial and a central eclipse) to occur in consecutive months.|$|E
5|$|Eclipses {{have been}} {{interpreted}} as omens, or portents. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus wrote that Thales of Miletus predicted an eclipse {{that occurred during}} a battle between the Medes and the Lydians. Both sides put down their weapons and declared peace {{as a result of}} <b>the</b> <b>eclipse.</b> The exact eclipse involved remains uncertain, although the issue has been studied by hundreds of ancient and modern authorities. One likely candidate took place on May 28, 585 BC, probably near the Halys river in Asia Minor. An eclipse recorded by Herodotus before Xerxes departed for his expedition against Greece, which is traditionally dated to 480 BC, was matched by John Russell Hind to an annular eclipse of the Sun at Sardis on February 17, 478 BC. Alternatively, a partial eclipse was visible from Persia on October 2, 480 BC. Herodotus also reports a solar eclipse at Sparta during the Second Persian invasion of Greece. The date of <b>the</b> <b>eclipse</b> (August 1, 477 BC) does not match exactly the conventional dates for the invasion accepted by historians.|$|E
