5|$|That rebellious {{attitude}} really came, I think, when {{my father}} remarried. Because for the three years before he married, I clung to him. It was like, OK, now you're mine, and you're not going anywhere. Like all young girls, I {{was in love with}} my father and I didn't want to lose him. I lost my mother, but then I was the mother, my father was mine. Then he got taken away from me when he married my stepmother. It was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> said, OK I don’t need anybody. No one's going to break my heart again. I'm not going to need anybody. I can stand on my own and be my own person and not belong to anyone.|$|E

The quality of the Test sides usually runs in cycles. A number of the batsmen who scored heavily on previous occasions found that Don Bradman had not spent hours at the wicket softening the bowling, and run-scoring against bowlers who were not tired was not so easy.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{has been}} a great source of {{inspiration}} for Michael Stipe of R.E.M. Listening to her album Horses when he was 15 made a huge impact on him; he said later, [...] "I decided <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was going to start a band." ...|$|E

I decided that I {{wanted to work with}} a whole bunch of different producers. [...] Björk's album was one of my favorite for years—it's brilliantly produced. And I also wanted to work with Massive Attack. So obviously, he was on the list. Nellee was the last person I worked with, and it wasn't until <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> got a grip of what the sound of the whole record was, so I had to go back and redo a lot.|$|E
500|$|While at high school, Miller {{formed a}} trio that played at {{cocktail}} parties. His elder brother recommended that he listen to pianist Oscar Peterson, {{but there was}} no way of doing this in Greenwood until Peterson appeared on The Joey Bishop Show on television when Miller was about 14. After watching Peterson's performance, Miller decided to become a pianist: [...] "It was a life changing event. I knew right <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would be a jazz pianist". Miller later mentioned Art Tatum and Erroll Garner as piano influences during his teenage years. Miller reported years later that he always found that playing fast was easy, so playing slowly and with more control were what he had to work hardest on.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Jackson {{started working}} on her ninth studio album, 20 Y.O., with her then partner, record {{producer}} Jermaine Dupri, who was commissioned as the executive producer. The discussion between the producers turned to how Jackson was feeling at the time her third studio album Control (1986) was recorded. [...] "I started asking questions like, 'What was the feeling of life when you were 20?' I was so intrigued with {{what was going on}} in her life <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> just thought her album should be called that", Dupri commented. Jackson wanted to maintain a R sound from her most recent albums, but with an emphasis on dance music. In June 2006, rapper Khia was confirmed on a song titled [...] "So Excited". However producer Dupri said she would be not rapping on the track, ...|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "Smile" [...] is a bubbly, mid-tempo {{tune with}} [...] "a barroom piano lick", subdued horns and a reggae beat, {{singing in a}} light falsetto, while the organ riff {{contains}} a sample of Jackie Mittoo playing keyboards on the 1960s rocksteady song [...] "Free Soul" [...] by The Soul Brothers, also written by Mittoo. He and Clement Dodd received credit on the song as co-writers. It was described to have a [...] "cod-reggae groove that smoulders like a barbecue", as a guitar and piano {{were used for the}} background music, following the notes Gm—F as its basic chord progression. It is set in the time signature of common time, having a metronome of 96 beats per minute, and is played in the key of F major. Lyrically, the song describes Allen's satisfaction in her former lover's suffering, being in a vengeful mood: [...] "At worst / I feel bad for a while, / But then I just smile / I go ahead and smile," [...] thus creating a contrast between [...] "the peppy melody and brassy lyrics". The inspiration for the song came from a real life experience, when Allen broke up with her then boyfriend, Lester Lloyd, resulting in a drug overdose and hospitalization for her depression. The singer claimed [...] "I started to get depressed and anyone who suffers from depression knows that it can soon get so bad that you can't get out of bed. It was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> checked into the Priory. That was really tough as I was an emotional mess. [...] The lyrics are definitely bitter-sweet". Allen said she later regretted the direct approach of her lyrics: I'm now less inclined to do that, because everything that I do say gets repeated in a way that I haven't said it, or taken out of context and spun in some negative way — and it makes me really sad. I'm not, like, a negative person. I'm actually quite positive, but this industry has really made me feel angry and negative recently. I'm not enjoying it at the moment.|$|E

2500|$|In July 1941, {{during the}} German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, HKP 562 was deployed to Vilnius (Vilna), Lithuania.

2500|$|Russell {{was born}} in Stroud, Gloucestershire, England. [...] He gained the support he needed to become a {{first-class}} cricketer from his father, John, at Stroud Cricket Club, and at Archway School. Two days before his fourteenth birthday, he saw a catch on television: McCosker, caught Knott, bowled Greig, at Headingley in 1977. Russell himself has commented: [...] "Low-down, one-handed, across first-slip. Brilliant. I thought <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{would like to be}} able to do that. That's where it started; that was the inspiration [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Being {{straight}} man {{to one of}} the greatest entertainers of our time was not all that easy. We were not always chums.

[...] I worked with him until his sudden death in 1956. I never stopped being a fan.

A scene with Batou feeding his dog is echoed in Ash in Avalon (2001). He {{explained}} the reason why all his films feature a basset hound—his companion in real life: [...] "This body you see before you is an empty shell. The dog represents my body. Human beings can be free only if they free themselves from their bodies. When I am playing around with my dog, I forget that I am a human being, and it's only <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel free." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} television, radio, and {{newspaper}} reports listed Ladany {{as one of}} those killed. One headline stated: [...] "Ladany Could Not Escape his Fate in Germany for a Second Time". Ladany recalled later:The impact did not hit me at the time, when we were in Munich. It was when we arrived back in Israel. At the airport in Lod there was a huge crowd – maybe 20,000, people – and each one of us, the survivors, stood by one of the coffins on the runway. Some friends {{came up to me and}} tried to kiss me and hug me as if I was almost a ghost that came back alive. It was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> really grasped what had happened and the emotion hit me.|$|E
2500|$|The young Slattery {{spent much}} of her {{childhood}} watching television and old Hollywood movies, from which she learned to impersonate her favorite actresses, such as Joan Bennett and Kim Novak. In 1961 she signed up for a course at the DeVern School of Cosmetology in Baldwin, on Long Island. She said that she [...] "learned about the mysteries of sex from a salesman in a local children's shoe store" [...] and finally revealed an inclination towards cross-dressing when her mother confronted her about local rumors, which described her as [...] "dressing as a girl" [...] and frequenting a local gay bar called The Hayloft. In response, Slattery left the room and reappeared in full feminine attire. Her mother later said that, [...] "I knew <b>then...</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> couldn't stop Jimmy. Candy was just too beautiful and talented." ...|$|E

2500|$|She is {{comes from}} Salthill, a seaside resort in Galway, Ireland. Her {{grandparents}} owned a pub and her grandfather {{was often the}} main entertainer; Mulholland has said, [...] "When her family get together there's always a sing-song. I come from a very musical family - every year we would meet on Christmas night and all the kids were encouraged {{to get up and}} perform. I think it was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> realised I loved singing." [...] The first musical Mulholland appeared in was an amateur production of The Sound of Music, where she played Brigitta. Shortly before starting her course at the Central School of Speech and Drama, she moved to London and successfully auditioned for a part as a traditional Irish dancer, in the professional dance show, Dance of Desire, in which she spent four months. In 2003, she became the 30th annual 'Galway Rose', and represented Galway at The Rose of Tralee contest.|$|E
2500|$|Spofforth truly {{announced}} {{himself to}} the cricketing world on 27 May 1878, when the touring Australians met the MCC at Lord's. In this, the second match of the tour, the might of the MCC was dismissed twice in one day at the fortress of English cricket for paltry scores of just 33 and nineteen. The colonists won by nine wickets, with Spofforth picking up ten for twenty after first clean-bowling Grace for a duck. Tom [...] "Felix" [...] Horan records that, when he did so, [...] "he jumped about two feet in the air, and sang out: 'Bowled! Bowled! Bowled!' And at the finish in the dressing-room, he said: 'Ain't I a demon? Ain't I a demon?' gesticulating the while in his well-known demonaic style. Whether or not he christened himself the demon, he certainly was a demon bowler." [...] Spofforth confirms this: [...] "To myself, {{it will always be}} a noteworthy occasion, since it was <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> first earned my popular sobriquet – 'the Demon'." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Snow {{wrote that}} Lou Rowan was 'utterly unable to {{distinguish}} between a delivery short of a length which rise around {{the height of the}} rib cage and a genuine bouncer which goes through head high'. and believed that chest high balls were not intimidatory. However, English umpire Dickie Bird wrote [...] "as far as I am concerned, intimidatory bowling is the fast, short pitched ball into the region of the batsman's ribcage. When such a ball is fired in it is <b>then</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel an umpire must be firm...and tell the bowler to cut it out...that's the killer ball, and that is when I always step in". As Snow hit tailenders Garth McKenzie and Terry Jenner on the head in the series and continually bowled short at the other Australian batsmen it was not unreasonable for the umpires to intervene. Snow thought this was partisanship as Alan Thomson was not called to book when he bowled bouncers at Snow and six in one eight-ball over against Ray Illingworth.|$|E
