5|$|As a {{classical}} singer, Turunen sings with classical vocal technique. She explained <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> days of Nightwish, {{it was difficult}} to combine classical technique with the metal sound in a way that gave her liberty of action without damaging her vocal cords. Classical techniques helped her to play with her voice, so she decided not to pursue extra training in rock/pop singing.|$|E
5|$|It is {{also worth}} noticing <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 16th century {{one of the}} houses which predated the palace hosted an osteria. In the late 1510s Raphael, at that time {{painting}} the Vatican loggias, often had lunch together with his aides in a rear room of that eatery. The artists often discussed work problems during lunch, sketching different solutions {{on the walls of the}} room. When the palace was built, the osteria remained in place, and the owners always took care of the walls of that room throughout the years.|$|E

5|$|Biographer Stephen Henderson {{maintains}} that Macdonald {{played a key}} role in the wartime conscription crises that beset the federal government in 1942, and again in 1944, as Prime Minister Mackenzie King tried to avoid imposing compulsory military service overseas. Macdonald himself strongly favoured conscription rather than relying solely on voluntary enlistment. A committed internationalist, he believed it unfair that some bore the sacrifices of overseas service while others escaped what he saw as their military obligations. Macdonald realized however, that conscription was highly unpopular in French-speaking Quebec and that enforcing it would split the country at a time when national unity was crucial. He also recognized <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> years of the war, voluntary enlistment was producing enough recruits to meet the needs of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Griffiths {{focused on the}} {{inconsistent}} portrayal of Horus and Set as brothers and as uncle and nephew. He argued <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> stages of Egyptian mythology, the struggle between Horus and Set as siblings and equals was originally separate from the murder of Osiris. The two stories were joined into the single Osiris myth sometime before {{the writing of the}} Pyramid Texts. With this merging, the genealogy of the deities involved and the characterization of the Horus–Set conflict were altered so that Horus is the son and heir avenging Osiris's death. Traces of the independent traditions remained in the conflicting characterizations of the combatants' relationship and in texts unrelated to the Osiris myth, which make Horus the son of the goddess Nut or the goddess Hathor rather than of Isis and Osiris. Griffiths therefore rejected the possibility that Osiris's murder was rooted in historical events. This hypothesis has been accepted by more recent scholars such as Jan Assmann and George Hart.|$|E
5|$|Jun Maeda, {{the main}} {{scenario}} writer of Air, commented <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> stages of Air production, {{it was already}} {{decided that it was}} to be an adult game, and he further assumes that if it was not at least first released with adult content, that {{it would not have been}} as commercially successful. Maeda also commented that he wanted to write Air to give players the chance to experience the entire story as a whole rather than just a sum of differing parts as typical bishōjo games do, including Kanon. While attempting to do this, Maeda also tried to simultaneously make it seem similar to typical visual novels in the same genre as Air to give the game appeal to the players who often play such games. As such, while the game incorporates stories from several characters, they are all of varying lengths.|$|E

5|$|Once {{a common}} sight {{in much of the}} continent, the bald eagle was {{severely}} affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide DDT. Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to biomagnification. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's calcium metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch. It is estimated <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 18th century, the bald eagle population was 300,000–500,000, but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 contiguous states of the US.|$|E
5|$|Sayf al-Dawla {{was widely}} celebrated {{for his role}} in the Arab–Byzantine Wars, facing a resurgent Byzantine Empire <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 10th century had begun to reconquer Muslim territories. In this {{struggle}} against a much superior enemy, he launched raids deep into Byzantine territory and managed to score a few successes, and generally held the upper hand until 955. After that, the new Byzantine commander, Nikephoros Phokas, and his lieutenants spearheaded an offensive that broke Hamdanid power. The Byzantines annexed Cilicia, and even occupied Aleppo itself briefly in 962. Sayf al-Dawla's final years were marked by military defeats, his own growing disability as a result of disease, and a decline in his authority that led to revolts by some of his closest lieutenants. He died in early 967, leaving a much weakened realm, which by 969 had lost Antioch and the Syrian littoral to the Byzantines and become a Byzantine tributary.|$|E
5|$|Surgeon and {{historian}} William Wilde recollected {{that as a}} medical student at Dr Steevens' Hospital in 1832 he was shown a silver trough, alleged to have belonged to Griselda Steevens, and accounts suggest <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 19thcentury a plaster cast of a human face with a pig's snout was {{on display at the}} hospital. Although the hospital authorities later forbade the display of alleged Steevens memorabilia on pain of dismissal, in the later half of the 19thcentury the belief that Steevens had a pig's face remained common. In the 1860s, a Dublin woman recollected that in her youth a large silver punchbowl, embossed with a family crest of a boar's head, was shown to visitors and was claimed to have been the Pig-faced Lady's trough.|$|E

5|$|Devers was an {{articulate}} {{proponent of}} the Army's now-emerging tactical doctrine of combined arms: infantry-artillery-armor-close air support. He carried a translation of a German manual on {{the components of the}} panzer division. Devers was neither the first nor the only general to embrace combined arms as the doctrinal {{solution to the problem of}} how best to employ tanks, but he was well-placed to act upon it. At his direction an updated, comprehensive (460 pages) Armed Force Field Manual: Tactics and Technique FM 17–10 was written, published and distributed in March 1942. A German manual on tank platoon tactics, with a foreword by Heinz Guderian, was translated into English and issued as an Armored Force publication. March 1942 saw a reorganization of the armored divisions in the wake of the 1941 maneuvers. Devers added an artillery headquarters to the armored division, and reorganized the artillery component into three battalions, each of three batteries of six M7 Priest self-propelled guns. A division trains headquarters was added to coordinate logistical activities. In a first, at Devers' insistence, a flight of light aircraft to be used for artillery spotting and reconnaissance were included in the new Table of Organization and Equipment (TO) for each division. He was a strong and early supporter of the development of the DUKW, an amphibious truck. Vannevar Bush later recalled <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> stages of its development, Devers was the only man in the Army who fully appreciated its possibilities. Its value would be demonstrated during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943.|$|E
5|$|Dinges wrote <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1970s the U.S. Justice Department {{had enough}} {{evidence}} to bring an indictment of Noriega on drug charges in a U.S. court, but chose {{not to do so}} because of the diplomatic consequences involved. This evidence included the testimony of an arrested boat courier, and of a drug smuggler arrested in New York. Though Torrijos frequently promised the U.S. cooperation in dealing with drug smuggling, Noriega would have headed any effort at enforcement, and the U.S. began to see him as the real problem. Dinges writes that the U.S. government considered several options to move Noriega out of the drug trafficking business, including assassinating him, and linking him to a fictional plot against Torrijos. Though no assassination attempt was made, the other ploys may have been tried in the early 1970s, according to Dinges. Beginning in 1972, however, Dinges writes that the U.S. relaxed its efforts at trapping individuals involved with smuggling within the Panama government, possibly {{as a result of an}} agreement between Torrijos and U.S. president Richard Nixon. Moreover, during the same period Noriega was becoming a trusted ally of the CIA, including acting as the U.S. emissary to Cuba during negotiations following the Johnny Express incident. Noriega, too, made an effort during this period to portray Panama as a hub of enforcement against drug smuggling, possibly as a result of pressure from Torrijos. Noriega's drug-related activities came to the U.S. government's attention once again during the ratification process for the Panama Canal treaties, but were once again downplayed by the U.S. intelligence services in order to get the treaty ratified by the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|The marsh shrew and the American {{water shrew}} (Sorex pallustris) share many {{physical}} characteristics. The former {{is found in}} a narrower area from the northwest coast to the lower slopes of the inland mountains. The American water shrew is more widely distributed across the western mountains and through the subarctic regions of Canada and the eastern U.S. The species' ranges are primarily allopatric; although they may overlap (sympatry) in coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest, differences in elevation tend to separate them. Early taxonomists placed these mammals into separate subgenera; Merriam assigned the marsh shrew to Atophyrax, and Jackson (1928) assigned the Pacific water shrew to Neosorex. A closer, dentition-based relationship was assigned by Findley (1955), with both species assigned to the subgenus Otisorex. Findley hypothesized <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> Pleistocene, the ancestors of masked and vagrant shrews (Sorex cinereus and Sorex vagrans, respectively) diverged; during the Yarmouth interglacial, the American water shrew and marsh shrew diverged from their vagrant-shrew ancestors. Three other Sorex species evolved during the Sangamonian: the dwarf shrew (S. nanus), the southeastern shrew (Sorex longirostris) and the ornate shrew (Sorex ornatus). Findley's assignment of the marsh shrew and the American water shrew to Otisorex was later reinforced by biochemical and genetic studies. In 2005, findings were published (based on mitochondrial DNA analysis) which better defined {{the nature of the}} relationships between marsh shrews, Pacific water shrews and their respective subspecies. Variations in the sequencing of cytochrome b mitochondrial DNA were assessed, and the results of the 2005 phylogeny for the marsh shrew are shown below in detail.|$|E
