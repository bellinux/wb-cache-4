5|$|Grant was on {{assignment}} in November 1963 to cover President John F. Kennedy's trip from Washington, D.C., to Dallas. One of his photographs made {{the front page}} of the November 22 edition of the Morning News; a copy is believed to be <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> Kennedy ever signed. Grant also would make several pictures at Parkland Memorial Hospital within minutes after Kennedy's motorcade arrived following the shooting in Dealey Plaza.|$|E
5|$|Conservation of the {{propeller}} was completed {{nearly three years}} after its recovery and it is {{on display in the}} Monitor Center at the Mariners' Museum. As of 2013, conservation of the engine, its components, the turret and the guns continues. The Dahlgren guns were removed from the turret in September 2004 and placed in their own conservation tanks. Among some of the artifacts recovered from the sunken vessel was a red signal lantern, possibly the one used to send a distress signal to Rhode Island and <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> to be seen before Monitor sank in 1862 – it was the first object recovered from the site in 1977. A gold wedding band was also recovered from the hand of the skeletal remains of one of Monitors crew members found in the turret.|$|E
5|$|Ferens {{remained}} a modest man; he saw giving {{as a moral}} duty and repeatedly declined offers of ennoblement. In replying to the headmaster’s speech when he visited Kingswood school in 1926, the King said: The headmaster is right in assuming that I am already well acquainted with Mr Ferens’s benefactions {{in other parts of}} the country; this is not the first time I have been associated with him in this manner, and though I know <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> that he would want would be a public expression of thanks on my part, I would like to be allowed to share in the debt of gratitude which the Kingswood School owes him today.|$|E

5|$|Vulović {{was in a}} coma for {{ten days}} after the crash. She {{sustained}} severe brain damage, having fractured her skull and then hemorrhaged. In addition, she suffered two broken legs and three broken vertebrae, one of which was crushed completely. Her pelvis was fractured and several ribs broken. Her injuries resulted in her being temporarily paralyzed below the waist. She had total amnesia from the hour preceding her fall until one month afterwards. Vulović's parents told her that she first learned of the crash about two weeks after it occurred. She fainted upon being shown a newspaper headline by her doctor and had to be tranquilized. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> that Vulović could remember from before the crash was greeting passengers as they boarded. The next thing she remembered was seeing her parents in her hospital room about one month later.|$|E
5|$|González-Gordon {{has been}} {{described}} as being proud of his Scottish heritage, which centred on the town of Huntly and the Clan Gordon. His personal clothing style reflected this; he was noted for his tweed jackets and British clothes in general. He had been married to Milagro López de Carrizosa y Eizaguirre for 62 years before she died in July 2013. The couple had two children, Bibiana and Mauricio, with Mauricio being the current president of the family company. During the three final years of his life González-Gordon was in poor health and could hardly leave his home. He died on 27 September 2013 in his hometown of Jerez de la Frontera at the age of 89. His family claims that <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> he drank was a Tío Pepe, the most famous brand of the family business. His death occurred at the Asisa clinic where he had spent his last couple of weeks. The memorial service was held at the San Juan Bautista de La Salle church on 28 September.|$|E
5|$|Nani is a {{young man}} who specialises in {{preparing}} fireworks. He is in love with his neighbour Bindu, a micro artist who runs Project 511, a non-governmental organisation (NGO). Bindu also develops feelings for Nani though she does not express them. Seeking to raise money for her NGO, Bindu visits the office of a rich, powerful industrialist named Sudeep, who also finds her attractive. He befriends her, donates 1.5 million (US$ thousand), and gains her trust. Sudeep sees Nani as a rival and plans to kill him. One night, Nani helps Bindu to finish a piece of micro art—a locket made from a pencil. While returning home, he is kidnapped by Sudeep, who kills him, making his death look like an accident. Unaware of the incident, Bindu proposes to the dying Nani by telephone; it is <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> Nani hears before he is reincarnated as a housefly that cannot remember its previous life.|$|E

5|$|The ride {{begins with}} Evac {{moving out of}} the loading station and making a turn. The vehicle {{approaches}} the first of thirteen 3D high-definition video screens which depicts Ravage grabbing a canister containing the AllSpark. Evac spins 180° to face the second screen on which Bumblebee is fighting Sideways for the AllSpark, which ends up in Evac's possession. Evac reverses into one of two elevator shafts which ascend to the second level of the attraction. During the ascent Optimus Prime battles Megatron and Grindor chases Evac who is furiously heading in reverse until Grindor's arm is broken off by a train. Megatron grabs Evac and the two struggle until Megatron breaks a water pipe, which sprays riders with water. Evac enters a dead end pathway before reversing and turning to face another 3D screen, which shows Megatron firing a missile at Evac while continuing to find Optimus. Hot air and fog generate the illusion of an explosion. Evac then heads through the hole in a building which was caused by the explosion. Inside lies Devastator, who is trying to suck everything out of the building. Ratchet and Ironhide cover fire while Evac reverses and escapes the suction. Here the Autobot Sideswipe helps in the battle against the Decepticon Bonecrusher. Devastator returns to the scene alongside Starscream. Evac escapes from Devastator a second time by going through him, but Starscream grabs Evac and throws him across several city blocks before landing on a construction site and smashing into some drums which release clouds of fog resulting in Evac asking if the riders are okay. Optimus Prime and Megatron continue their battle in the construction site as Evac reverses away in an attempt to protect the AllSpark. Starscream appears for a second time but is chased away by two NEST helicopters. Evac then returns to a second set of two elevators. During the descent to the ground floor, Evac forces the AllSpark into Megatron's chest causing both to freefall to the ground when Megatron grabs Evac. Bumblebee saves Evac from destruction before Optimus Prime congratulates Evac and the riders on their mission. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> guests see before disembarking is the twisted wreckage of Megatron stuck in the ceiling near the exit.|$|E

25|$|Jude McGregor: Callum's older brother, {{who holds}} a grudge against Sephy, who he {{believes}} {{to be responsible for}} his brother's death. He hates all crosses but becomes romantically inclined towards a cross, Cara, to use her for her money. Despite his best efforts, he starts to have genuine feelings for Cara, but the resultant confusion and his conflicting emotions ultimately prove too much. He ends up beating her to death and taking all her money. He later attempts to use Callie Rose to get back at Sephy, by training her to be a terrorist, but his plan backfires when Jasmine takes the bomb and activates it in his hotel room. Before he is killed in the bomb blast, he finally admits his feelings for Cara to himself, as she is <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> he sees before he is killed.|$|E
25|$|The {{siege of}} Jerusalem in 597BCE {{led to the}} city being {{overcome}} by the Babylonians, who then took the young King Jehoiachin into Babylonian captivity, together {{with most of the}} aristocracy. Zedekiah, who had been placed on the throne by Nebuchadnezzar (the Babylonian king), rebelled, and Nebuchadnezzar, who at the time (587/586BCE) was ruler of a most powerful empire, recaptured the city, killed Zedekiah's descendants in front of him, and plucked out Zedekiah's eyes so that that would be <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>thing</b> he ever saw. The Babylonians then took Zedekiah into captivity, along with prominent members of Judah. The Babylonians then burnt the temple, destroyed the city's walls, and appointed Gedaliah son of Achikam as governor of Judah. After 52 days of rule, Yishmael, son of Netaniah, a surviving descendant of Zedekiah, assassinated Gedaliah after encouragement by Baalis, the king of Ammon. Some of the remaining population of Judah, fearing the vengeance of Nebuchadnezzar, fled to Egypt.|$|E
