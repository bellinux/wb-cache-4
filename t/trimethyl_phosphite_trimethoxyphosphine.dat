The large potential difference between the two reduction waves of the bimetallic complex 1 (269 mV) indicates a stable mixed-valence Co (III) -Co (II) state for the reduced [Cp*Co(btt) CoCp*] (-) anion.

The stability constants of these P(OMe) 3 adducts were determined from UV-vis spectroscopic titration experiments, with, for example, log(K/mol (- 1). dm (3)) values of 3. 1 and 0. 52 for the mono- and bis-adduct of 1, respectively. The electrochemical investigation of 1 and 8 in excess phosphite shows a strong current enhancement upon oxidation, attributable to the catalytic generation of the radical cation P(OMe) 3 (*+) ...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis concerns the reactions of phosphites when replacing phosphates in synthesis by atomic layer deposition (ALD). One goal {{of this research is}} keeping the oxidation state of phosphorous at + 3 to gain new products and using these in Li-ion batteries. This could also expand the possibilities of ALD synthesis. Two phosphite precursors have been tested, <b>trimethyl</b> <b>phosphite</b> (Me 3 PO 3) and triethyl phosphite (Et 3 PO 3). Me 3 PO 3 has been successfully combined with the known precursors Lithium tert-butoxide (LiO(CH 3) 3) and trimethyl aluminium (Al(CH 3) 3). The products formed using M 33 PO 3 are amorphous Li 3 PO 4 and AlP 0, 5 O 4 thin films with growth rates of 0. 11 and 0. 09 nm/cycle, respectively, at a deposition temperature of 225 °C. ALD synthesis with the Et 3 PO 3 precursor resulted in films without phosphorous and are deemed incompatible for ALD synthesis due to low reactivity. The ternary films have been characterised using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to define oxidation states of phosphorous as well as quantification of composition. The oxidation state of phosphorous in the deposited thin films was + 5 for all the deposited films, proving that the phosphorous is oxidised during deposition. Li 3 PO 4 is a compound that has been previously used in Li-ion batteries as solid electrolytes. Building on that work, the LiPO films in this work have been analysed for use as a barrier layer between a LiFePO 4 cathode and a liquid electrolyte (LiPF 6). This was done by depositing thin films directly onto the cathode material using ALD and assembling the cathode material into a coin cell with a lithium metal anode. The results show increased stability and capacity retention at low specific discharge currents as measured using galvanostatic cycling. They also reduced the over-potential required for charge and discharge of the electrochemical cells at film thicknesses less than 5 nm as measured by cyclic voltammetry. 30 nm barrier layers reduced performance, but LiPO might still be viable as a solid electrolyte if LiPO is used as the only electrolyte. This work can facilitate the future deposition of ALD batteries in one single experiment...|$|R

40|$|Infrared and Solid State NMR spectroscopies {{have been}} used to study the {{reactions}} of PMenCl 3 -n (n = 0 to 2) with silica, the reactions of P(OMe) 3 and related compounds with alumina, as well as the adsorption of PMe 3 on a variety of oxides. PMe 3 interacts with silica activated at moderate temperatures via hydrogen bonding or physisorption only. PCl 3 interacts with silica at room temperature via a weak hydrogen bonding interaction. Previous assignments in the literature of two kinds of hydrogen bonded complex are shown to be in error. OPCl 3, often present as an impurity in PCl 3, is shown to be responsible for the infrared peaks that had previously been incorrectly assigned to a second type of adsorbed PCl 3.

It reacts to form ≡Si-O-P(O) Me 2, removing most of the surface silanol groups in the process. The identity of this species could be verified by both IR and NMR. IR spectra of a thin film of O exchanged silica showed that this compound definitely does extract oxygen from the silica surface. PMeCl 2 shows intermediate reactivity towards silica. Most of the surface silanol groups are consumed after four or five hours reaction time. The dominant phosphorus containing surface species is ≡Si-O-P(O) (H) Me. Dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) reacts with Al 2 O 3 by losing its methoxy groups in a sequential manner. For room temperature interaction molecular DMMP, either hydrogen bonded to the surface or coordinated to Lewis acidic aluminium atoms, is the predominant species. After reaction at 100 ∘C most of the DMMP molecules have lost one methoxy group. After 300 ∘C reaction all of the DMMP has lost both of its methoxy groups. Dimethyl phosphite (DMP) reacts in a similar manner to DMMP, although some P-Me groups form during the reaction, indicating that Al 2 O 3 can cleave the P-H bond of dialkyl <b>phosphites.</b> <b>Trimethyl</b> <b>phosphite</b> reacts with Al 2 O 3 to give all of the products observed in the reactions of DMMP and DMP with Al 2 O 3.

40|$|Because {{of their}} diverse {{biological}} properties and their high {{potential for the}} development of new drugs the synthesis of fluorenes and related systems such as benzo[b]fluorenes is of great interest in the fields of organic and medicinal chemistry. The most relevant benzo[b]fluorenes include the naturally occurring kinamycins. Recently, two fluorene derivatives have been isolated from the sweat of hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius). The biological function of the two dyes named hipposudoric acid (4) and norhipposudoric acid (5) is still unknown. For the synthesis of fluorenes a number of synthetic approaches have been developed. Among the most important methods there are the intramolecular electrophilic substitution, the Pschorr cyclization and palladium-mediated intramolecular cyclizations. The first part of the present study focusses on the construction of fluorenes carrying several methoxy groups by employing the Pschorr cyclization and the palladium-mediated intramolecular cyclization of suitable substrates. A comparison of the two methods is also presented. In addition, the cleavage of the methyl ethers 203 into the corresponding hydroxy-substituted fluoren- 9 -ones 206 is also included in the first part. To begin with, the synthesis of hydroxy- and alkoxy-substituted fluoren- 9 -ones through Pschorr cyclizations was studied. For the preparation of the substrates 233 the bromides 229 were first lithiated with t-butyllithium and then reacted with the aldehydes 231. Using this method it was possible to prepare the secondary alcohols 233 a-e with excellent yields ranging from 87 to 98 % (Scheme 74). Treatment of the secondary alcohols 233 a-e using K 2 Cr 2 O 7 as an oxidant gave the corresponding ketones 234 a-e with very good yields (85 to 92 %; Table 16). Reduction of the nitro group of the substituted ketones 234 a-e using iron powder resulted in the formation of substituted 2 -aminobenzophenones 235 a-e with very good results (Table 17). The compounds 235 a-e were cyclized to furnish the methoxy-substituted fluoren- 9 -ones by Pschorr cyclizations. For this purpose the substituted 2 -aminobenzophenones 235 a-e were oxidized to the corresponding diazonium salts with n-amylnitrite in glacial acetic acid at 0 °C which underwent cyclization to give the methoxy-substituted fluoren- 9 -ones 236 a-e with yields ranging from 72 to 86 % (Table 18). Ether cleavage of the methoxy-substituted fluoren- 9 -ones 236 a-e performed using boron tribromide resulted {{in the formation of the}} hydroxy-substituted fluoren- 9 -ones 242 a-e with yields between 60 and 84 % (Table 19). These results show that the Pschorr cyclization allows for the preparation of substituted fluoren- 9 -ones in four steps from readily available starting materials. Palladium-mediated reactions play a very important role in current organic synthesis. Therefore, it was studied whether the palladium-mediated cyclizations of 2 -iodo-substituted benzophenones 243 can be employed for the efficient synthesis of fluoren- 9 -ones. It was of great interest to learn whether this method is superior to the Pschorr cyclization approach. For this purpose, the 2 -iodobenzophenone derivatives 243 a-f were synthesized. They were obtained by reaction of the 2 -amino-substituted benzophenones 235 with n-amylnitrite followed by treatment with KI. Following this procedure, the iodides 243 a-e could be obtained with yields between 65 and 73 % (Table 20). Compound 243 f was synthesized by intermolecular Friedel-Crafts acylation of 228 with 244 in 97 % yield (Scheme 75). It turned out that the best results for the palladium-mediated cyclization of the iodides 243 a-c,e,f could be achieved when PdCl 2 (PPh 3) 2 was used as a palladium reagent in the presence of NaOAc as a base and DMA as a solvent. Heating at 130 °C afforded the fluoren- 9 -ones 236 a-c,e,f with yields in the range between 31 and 86 % (Scheme 76). On the whole, it can be concluded that the palladium-catalyzed intramolecular arylations of 243 suffer from high palladium-loadings, high reaction temperatures and long reaction times. In addition, in a few cases the yields for the palladium-mediated cyclizations are not sufficient. Compared to the results of the Pschorr cyclizations the palladium-mediated cyclizations need an extra step; i. e. the transformation of the 2 -aminobenzophenones 235 into the corresponding 2 -iodobenzophenones 243. This is why the Pschorr cyclization is more efficient for the synthesis of fluoren- 9 -ones 236 than the palladium-mediated cyclization. In addition, attempts were undertaken to cyclize the substituted 2 -nitrobenzophenones 234 b,c to the corresponding acridinones 205. When the benzophenones were treated with triethyl phosphite (161) the unexpected formation of diethyl N-arylphosphoramidates 251 b (59 % yield) and 251 c (62 % yield) was observed. With these unexpected results in hand it was decided to develop a new synthetic protocol for the efficient conversion of nitroarenes into the corresponding phosporamidates. Phosporamidate oligonucleotides play an important role in medicinal chemistry because they have been considered for diagnostic as well as therapeutic applications within the antisense field. The preparation of phosphoramidate substituted nucleoside analogues is also of great interest as many of them exhibit anticancer, antiviral (anti-HIV) and spermicidal activities. Therefore, the second goal of this thesis was to develop a practical and efficient method for the synthesis of dialkyl N-arylphosphoramidates by reaction of readily available nitroarenes with tervalent phosphorous reagents such as triethyl <b>phosphite</b> or <b>trimethyl</b> <b>phosphite</b> under both thermal and microwave conditions. In order to evaluate the scope of this conversion it was necessary to study the effects of substitution on the aromatic ring at different positions. It was found that nitroarenes 255 a-o can easily be transformed into the corresponding diethyl N-arylphosphoramidates 256 a-o by treatment with an excess of triethyl <b>phosphite</b> (161) or <b>trimethyl</b> <b>phosphite</b> (257). Yields were in the range of 52 to 79 % (Table 21). The results obtained clearly indicate that ? in contrast to previous reports ? the reaction of nitroarenes with trialkyl phosphites is a practical and efficient method for the selective preparation of dialkyl N-arylphosphoramidates in one synthetic operation. The structures of all compounds prepared during this study have been elucidated unambiguously by analytical and spectroscopic methods including NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, UV spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Aufgrund ihrer vielfältigen biologischen Eigenschaften und ihres großen Potentials für die Entwicklung neuer Medikamente ist die effiziente Synthese von Fluorenen und verwandten Systemen wie den Benzo[b]fluorenen von großem Interesse in der Organischen und Medizinischen Chemie. Zu den interessantesten Benzo[b]fluorenen zählen die natürlich vorkommenden Kinamycine. Kürzlich wurden zwei Fluorenderivate aus dem Schweiß des Nilpferdes (Hippopotamus amphibius) isoliert, die als Hipposudorinsäure (4) und Norhipposudorinsäure (5) bezeichnet wurden. Über die biologische Funktion dieser zwei Farbstoffe ist bislang nur wenig bekannt. Für die Synthese von Fluorenen setzt man vor allem intramolekulare elektrophile aromatische Substitutionen, Pschorr-Cyclisierungen und Palladium-vermittelte intramolekulare Cyclisierungen ein. Im ersten Teil der vorliegenden Arbeit wird der Aufbau mehrfach Methoxy-substituierter Fluorenone durch Pschorr-Cyclisierungen und Palladium-vermittelte intramolekulare Cyclisierungen geeigneter Substrate beschrieben und miteinander verglichen. Darüberhinaus wird die Spaltung der Methylether in die entsprechenden Hydroxy-substituierten Fluorenone vorgestellt. Zunächst wurde die Synthese von Hydroxy- und Alkoxy-substituierten Fluoren- 9 -onen durch Pschorr-Cyclisierung untersucht. Für die Darstellung der Substrate 233 wurden die Bromide 229 mit t-Butyllithium lithiiert und dann mit den Aldehyden 231 umgesetzt. Unter Verwendung dieser Methode war es möglich, die sekundären Alkohole 233 a-e mit ausgezeichneten Ausbeuten zwischen 87 und 98 % herzustellen (Schema 74). Die anschließende Behandlung der sekundären Alkohole 233 a-e mit K 2 Cr 2 O 7 als Oxidationsmittel ergab die entsprechenden Ketone 234 a-e mit sehr guten Ausbeuten zwischen 85 und 92 % (Tabelle 16). Die Reduktion der Nitrogruppe der substituierten Ketone 234 a-e mit Eisenpulver führte mit sehr guten Ausbeuten zur Bildung der substituierten 2 -Aminobenzophenone 235 a-e (Tabelle 17). Es gelang dann, die Verbindungen 235 a-e durch Pschorr-Cyclisierung in die Methoxy-substituierten Fluoren- 9 -one umzuwandeln. Dazu wurden die substituierten 2 -Aminobenzophenone 235 a-e unter Verwendung von n-Amylnitrit in Essigsäure bei 0 °C zu den entsprechenden Diazoniumsalzen oxidiert. Die so gebildeten Diazoniumsalze cyclisierten dann mit Ausbeuten zwischen 72 und 86 % zu den Methoxy-substituierten Fluoren- 9 -onen 236 a-e (Tabelle 18). Die Etherspaltung der Methoxy-substituierten Fluoren- 9 -one 236 a-e gelang mit Bortribromid und lieferte die entsprechenden Hydroxy-substituierten Fluoren- 9 -one 242 a-e mit 60 bis 84 % Ausbeute (Tabelle 19). Diese Ergebnisse zeigen, dass man substituierte Fluoren- 9 -one mit Hilfe der Pschorr-Cyclisierung aus leicht zugänglichen Substraten in insgesamt vier Stufen darstellen kann. Palladium-vermittelte Reaktionen spielen in der modernen organischen Synthese eine sehr wichtige Rolle. Daher wurde untersucht, ob man Palladium-vermittelte Cyclisierungen substituierter 2 -Iodobenzophenone 243 für die effiziente Synthese von Fluoren- 9 -onen einsetzen kann. Von großem Interesse war in diesem Zusammenhang vor allem die Frage ob diese Methode der klassischen Pschorr-Cyclisierung überlegen ist. Dazu wurden zunächst die 2 -Iodobenzophenone 243 a-e synthetisiert. Sie ließen sich durch Reaktion der substituierten 2 -Aminobenzophenone 235 a-e mit n-Amylnitrit und anschließender Behandlung mit KI zugänglich machen. Nach diesem Verfahren erhielt man die Iodide 243 a-e mit Ausbeuten zwischen 65 und 73 % (Tabelle 20). Die Verbindung 243 f wurde durch eine intermolekulare Friedel-Crafts Acylierung von 228 mit 244 in einer Ausbeute von 97 % synthetisiert (Schema 75). Im weiteren Verlauf der Arbeit zeigte sich, dass man die besten Ergebnisse für die Palladium-vermittelten Cyclisierungen der Iodide 243 erhielt, wenn man PdCl 2 (PPh 3) 2 als Palladium-Reagenz in Gegenwart von NaOAc als Base und DMA als Lösungsmittel einsetzte. Erhitzen der Reaktionsmischung auf 130 °C führte zur Bildung der Fluoren- 9 -one 236 a-c,e,f mit Ausbeuten zwischen 31 und 86 % (Schema 76). Alles in Allem bleibt festzuhalten, dass die Palladium-vermittelten intramolekularen Arylierungen von 243 verschiedene Nachteile, wie die große Menge an benötigten Palladium-Reagenzien, die hohen Reaktionstemperaturen sowie die langen Reaktionszeiten, aufweisen. Dazu kommt, dass in einigen wenigen Fällen die Ausbeuten nicht ausreichend sind. Im direkten Vergleich mit den Pschorr-Cyclisierungen zeigt sich auch, dass man zur Durchführung der Palladium-vermittelten Cyclisierungen einen zusätzlichen Reaktionsschritt, und zwar die Umwandlung der 2 -Aminobenzophenone 235 in die entsprechenden 2 -Iodbenzophenone 243, benötigt. Aus diesen Gründen ist die Pschorr-Cyclisierung für den effizienten Aufbau der Fluoren- 9 -one 236 besser geeignet als die Palladium-vermittelte Cyclisierung. Im Weiteren versuchte man die Cyclisierung der substituierten 2 -Nitrobenzophenone 234 b,c zu den entsprechenden Acridinonen 205. Wenn die Benzophenone mit Triethylphosphit (161) zur Reaktion gebracht wurden, beobachtete man die unerwartete Bildung der Diethyl-N-arylphosphoramidate 251 b (59 % Ausbeute) und 251 c (62 % Ausbeute) (Schema 77). Diese unerwarteten Ergebnisse führten zur Entwicklung einer neuen Synthesemethode für die effiziente Transformation von Nitroarenen in die entsprechenden Phosporamidate. Phosporamidat-Oligonucleotide spielen in der Medizinischen Chemie eine wichtige Rolle, da sie im Rahmen von Antisense-Ansätzen sowohl für den Einsatz in der Diagnostik als auch für den Einsatz als Therapeutika in Betracht kommen. Die Herstellung von Phosporamidat- substituierten Nucleosidanaloga ist ebenfalls von großem Interesse, da viele von ihnen Antitumor-Eigenschaften aufweisen bzw. antiviral (anti-HIV) oder spermizid wirksam sind. Daher war es das Ziel, eine praktische und effiziente Methode für den Aufbau von Dialkyl N-arylphosphoramidaten durch Umsatz leicht zugänglicher Nitroarene mit tervalenten Phosphor-Reagenzen wie Triethylphosphit oder Trimethylphosphit sowohl unter thermischen als auch unter Mikrowellenbedingungen zu entwickeln. Um die Anwendungsbreite der Reaktion zu untersuchen, war es nötig, den Einfluss verschiedener Substituenten an unterschiedlichen Ringpositionen des Nitroaromaten zu untersuchen. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass sich die Nitroarene 255 a-o leicht und mit Ausbeuten zwischen 52 und 79 % durch Reaktion mit einem Überschuss an Triethylphosphit (161) bzw. Trimethylphosphit (257) in die entsprechenden Diethyl N-arylphosphoramidate 256 a-o umwandeln lassen (Tabelle 21). Die hier vorgestellten Ergebnisse zeigen ganz klar, dass die Reaktion von Nitroarenen mit Triethylphosphit ? abweichend von bislang bekannten Ergebnissen ? ein praktisches und effizientes Verfahren für die selektive Darstellung von Dialkyl N-arylphosphoramidaten in einem Schritt darstellt. Die Strukturen aller im Rahmen dieser Arbeit synthetisierten Substanzen wurden zweifelsfrei durch analytische und spektroskopische Methoden, wie NMR-Spektroskopie, Massenspektrometrie, UV-Spektroskopie, IR-Spektroskopie und Elementaranalyse aufgeklärt...|$|R
