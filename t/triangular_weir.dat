The study was carried out on four different types of weirs under different flow conditions (sharp crested weir, broad crested weir, <b>triangular</b> <b>weir,</b> and trapezoidal weir). Also, the study deals with the effect of head angle of the triangle weir on discharge coefficient. This study was carried out through 254 experimental runs. The study showed that the discharge coefficient (Cd) in both sharp and broad crested weirs was affected by the relative crest height (H/Y). By using the regression analysis, two formulas between the discharge coefficient (Cd) and the dimensionless crest height (H/Y) for both sharp and broad crested weirs were presented. The comparative study between the developed formulas and those formulas developed by other researchers showed good agreement in discharge coefficient values. For <b>triangular</b> <b>weir,</b> the effect of head angle () on discharge coefficient (Cd) {{was more than the}} effect of relative head (H/Y).

So they could maked more space to sotrage water and restrained foold with higher discharge. Labyrinths weirs have three generally form triangles, trapezoidal and rectangular that Tullis et al. (15) presented formula (3) for discharge coefficient of labyrinth weirs (triangles and rectangular) and a few studiescarried out on rectangular shape and its hydraulic characteristics are not specified. Therefore main aim of this paper study and characterized hydraulic characteristics of rectangular labyrinth weirs by using laboratory data. Materials and Methods: In this study rectangular labyrinth weir discharge and coefficient discharge relationships used dimensional analysis and experiment on hydraulic modeling, constant coefficient was defined. Laboratory flume is shown in Figure 2 (0. 5 m wide x 12 m long x 0. 8 m deep). Models was made from clear plexiglass plate with 10 cm thickness thatcuted using leaserdevice and the crest manualy shaped quadrant with radius 10 cm, all models using silicon glue install in the flume. The upstream depth readership by point gauge that installed in upstream of models. Discharge calcutaed byupsterm depth of <b>triangular</b> <b>weir</b> that installed in down stream of flume. Data were analyzed by SPSS software and to compare relationships with each other used two parameter {{root mean square error}} and correlation coefficient and charts darw in Excel Results and Discussion: discharge coefficient formula (11) carried out by using SPSS software that compared with formula (3). Results showed (Tables 2 and 3) that the correlation coefficient of formula (11) was more than a formula (3) and formula (11) RSME was less than formula (3) RSME except in first and fifth hydraulic model (rectengular 1 and 5) that they were almost equal. So the formula (11) was more accurate than a formula (3) to peredict discharge of flow in flume. In previous step we used all data, we saw flourmloa (11) had more accurate then we diceded data divided in to three groups: high change, length change and all that calculated correlation coefficient and RSME for formula (11) to figure out which group have more accurate, results was brought in table 4. The result showed that constant coefficient of formula (11) yields from all data was useful for the design proposed. Plotted discharge changes against H/P for rectangular labyrinth and straight weirs in Figs. 3 and 4. In constant discharge and high with raising length weir, decreased depth of flow over the weir because the effective weir length was raised and the ratio of distributed length to apex length (b) was decreased. As well as in constant H/P and high weir with raising apex length, discharge was increased that similarity of the results of Tullis et al. (15) and Khode et al. (8). In length, and the ratio H / P constant with increasing height in the discharge coefficient due to submergence reduce local side Jt Hay reduce interference, but increases with increasing height from 0. 20 to 0. 25 m m discharge coefficient decreases as flow rate and Weber number decreased {{as a result of the}} effect of surface tension and increased resistance to flow. In length, and the ratio H / P fixed amount of overflow discharge increases with increasing height as the ratio H / P value of the denominator increases and therefore increases the total height of the water upstream. For designoverflow rectangular labyrinth weirs recommends 0. 20 ≤H/P≤ 0. 40 that maximum aeration and discharge coefficient in this range is the result of Hay and Taylor (7) and Darvas (4) is consistent. In discharge and fixed weir height and maximum height of the water upstream directly at least equal to 1. 8 of the overflow stright weirs. So for the areas where there is a height restriction of water upstream, the water level upstream of rectangular labyrinth weirs less direct overflow weirs requires the use of this is recommended. Conclusion: The results showed the relationship (11) that uses most of effective parameters has more accurate results and proposed for design aim. In constant water head upstream discharge of labyrinth weir maximum 2. 6 times more than straight weir discharge and in constant discharge water head upstream of straight weir 1. 8 times more than upstream labyrinth weir water head so use a labyrinth weir appropriate for areas that have head and discharge restrictions.

The first input combination consists of five simple input variables. By moving from the first input combination to the last, the number of variables decreases and their complexity increases. The results show that all of the considered methods performed significantly better when using the first input combination. Subsequently, the results of the three hybrid ANFIS models with the first input combination were compared with each other using standard deviation. According to the results, the difference between the training and testing errors in the ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-PSO models is very high and these models’ results are not reliable to use in practical situations. Finally, the results of the ANFIS-DE method with the first input combination of w/b, y 1 /b, L/b, sin(θ/ 2), and Fr 1 was compared with previous works by Borghei and Parvaneh (2011) and Emiroglu et al.

40|$|Introduction: Weirs {{are one of}} {{the common}} {{structures}} for discharge and flow measurement. Therefore,these types of hydraulic structures depending on the purposeofuse havedifferent shapes. In some cases, due to practical constraints, spillways with curvature in plan are designed. In such situations study of flow distribution over the spillway and other related parameters, will be important. In this study, a physical model of dam spillway, which is type of ogee-crested weir with curvature in plan, were tested. Also in order to investigate the effects of curvature on the performance of the flow, the second model of spillway in normal shape, with similar geometric and hydraulic conditions, were compared. Materials and Methods: First physical model of prototype is built at the scale of 1 : 75 and the second model was constructed in straight form (without curvature in plan) with similar geometric conditions to the first model. Spillways have been designed according to USBR standard for design head at value of 4 cm in model and vertical upstream face. Experiments were performed in Soil Conservation and Watershed Management Research Institute at reservoir with dimensions 1. 2 m length, 0. 70 m width and 0. 5 m height walls of Plexiglas. To measure the flow discharge, a sharp <b>triangular</b> <b>weir</b> with apex angle of 90 ˚ in the output of channle was used. Measurements in first model were conducted with five discharges and five values of h/Hd (0. 53, 0. 74, 0. 90, 1. 08 and 1. 44) and for six sectors on spillway body. To evaluate the effect of curvature, flow performance and discharge coefficient changes were compared for five early discharges (ratio of critical depth to design head at value of 0. 28, 0. 44, 0. 58, 0. 72 and 0. 81) and six other discharge (mentioned ratio at value of 0. 36, 0. 51, 0. 66, 0. 76 and 0. 83) in both models. Results and Discussion: The results related to the first model showed that by increasing the ratio of head to design head (h/Hd), rate of spillway discharge coefficient increases to the value of 1. 72 and decreases to 1. 23, when the weir was submerged. It also observed that with increase in flow rate of each discharge and reducing the pressure along the spillway, possibility of vacuum-creation and corrosion of structure increased and the corrosion rate witch introduced by Cavitation Index decreased. The minimum value for Cavitation Index that has been calculated was 1. 45 that is greater than the critical value of it. The results of the pressure distribution and changes of Cavitation Index in first model showed, the minimum height of the pressure for each discharge occurred at the end of ogee profile and the minimum value of the Cavitation Index occurred at the last section of spillway in downstream for the value of h/Hd= 0. 53. As well as for all test cases in this study, the maximum velocity and minimum of Cavitation Index were calculated at the same section of spillway where hydraulic jump was observed. On the other hand, it was observed that with increasing flow rate, the critical section moves upward on the spillway body. The results related to the spillway efficiency generally indicated that by increasing the ratio of critical depth to design head (yc/Hd) discharge coefficient increases. In fact, by increasing the ratio of h/Hd and increase the discharge rate up to design discharge, the amount of evacuation and efficiency of both models goes up. For larger discharges, the flow is blocked by the spillway forehead and model efficiency will decrease due to submersion and flow rejection. Results obtained from comparison of two models indicated for the spillway in normal shape submergence of the weir occurred faster and discharge coefficient of each test achieved in lesser value per test, So that the discharge coefficient increasing in curved spillway continued until the value of 0. 81 yc/Hd (at 10. 3 lit/s of discharge) and in normal shape until the value of 0. 72 yc/Hd (at 9. 2 lit/s of discharge). Therefore it seems that the upward central arch factor will increase the discharge coefficient and efficiency of spillway. Conclusion: In the present research the hydraulic performance of ogee spillway with curved plan to investigate the pressure distribution and the vacuum-creation and in particular to compare the results related to flow performance and the effect of spillway curvature on its performance were studied using two experimental models. The impact of increasing the discharge coefficient for the weir with upward central arch compared to weir with straight crest, in terms of similar geometric and hydraulic conditions, was calculated to the value of 21 percent, in this study...|$|E

These air bubbles greatly increase the surface area available for mass transfer.

30|$|A piano key weir {{is a kind}} of {{labyrinth}} hydraulic structure, in general, placed transversely to {{rivers that}} causes flow discontinuity and affects the hydraulics of rivers (Erpicum et al. 2011; Laugier et al. 2012; Ouamane 2013). General transverse structures like <b>weir</b> (<b>triangular</b> or rectangular) have a significant function in maintaining the upstream depth of water and securing water resources for optimum use (Kabiri-Samani and Javaheri 2012; Nayan Sharma 2007; Nayan Sharma 2013; Payne et al. 2004). However, it destabilizes sediment continuity, because flow velocity is reduced due to the increased water depth (Bai and Duan 2014; Fan and Morris 1992). Due to the restricting nature of sediment downstream, it is deposited directly upstream of a weir (Kim et al. 2014; Kondolf et al. 2014). As sediment from upstream normally moves downstream with flowing water, the geographical features are changed and hydro-ecological habitats are subsequently affected. Inhibited sediment continuity has an effect on the hydro-environmental status downstream of a weir, which can result in serious disturbance to the riparian ecosystem (Kim et al. 2014). To support the recovery of sediment continuity in rivers, the piano key weir might be used as an alternative transverse structure. It needs the elemental study microturbulence phenomenon near PKW to point out the sediment transport (Sharma et al. 2012). The interaction of flow and sediment transport in rivers creates a variety of interesting phenomena and morphologies, including dunes, bars, meandering, alluvial fans, submarine channels, etc. Insertion of any structure to the flow can change the interaction between flow and sediment transport (Mazumder and Sarkar 2014). For the sediment transport and their interaction study, a comprehensive study of turbulence behavior is required.|$|R
40|$|V-shaped weirs {{with small}} angles are {{efficient}} in accurately measuring extremely small discharge rates. The concept of slit weirs to measure discharge rates {{has been studied}} in recent investigations. Rectangular multi-slit notches or weirs {{have been shown to}} extend the range of flow measurement to include both very low and high discharge rates. It is a well-known fact that V-notches whose sections are narrower at lower heads are preferred to rectangular notches to measure small discharge rates in laboratories. To increase the range of discharges measured, the concept of multi-slit weirs using rectangular weirs has been introduced recently. For rectangular multi-slit weirs, experimental data showed that the discharge coefficient C d for multi-slit weirs or a single weir was a function of the Reynolds number R e when R e is based on the width of rectangular weirs. V-notches are generally used for laboratory flow measurements, as they can very precisely measure discharge rates. Hence, the multi-slit weirs formed by V-notches are expected to measure discharges in a very wide range of discharge rates. To represent a common discharge coefficient C d for multi-slit weirs formed of either rectangular or <b>triangular</b> shaped individual <b>weirs,</b> a new Reynolds number R eR is proposed to unify representation of discharge coefficient data for both rectangular shaped and V-shaped multi-slit weir units. C d data for both rectangular and V-shaped multi-slit weirs fall on a single curve and appear to be the function of R eR. At large Reynolds number, R eR, the discharge coefficient C d approaches a constant value of 0. 61. This constant also denotes the contraction coefficient for the narrow two-dimensional slit flow. Present test data show that C d for multi-slit V-shaped weirs is generally a function of R eR for b/B < 0. 3. Here, R eR is based on the hydraulic radius R and b is the value of top flow width of the water passing the multi-slit weirs. A very limited number of numerical simulations are also performed to determine discharge coefficient (C d) and the water surface profiles for the multi-slit V-shaped weirs. The predictions related to the surface profile based on the numerical model are validated by experimental data.

30|$|A {{side weir}} is {{installed}} on the side wall of the main channel in order to adjust the flow level. Also, flow within open channel along the side weir is considered as spatially varied flow (SVF) with decreasing discharge. Moreover, many experimental and analytical researches and {{studies have been conducted}} on the flow pattern of these types of structures. There are so many studies on the flow within rectangular channels along the side weir carried out by various researchers. For example, Ackers (1957), Nandesamoorthy and Thomson (1972), Yu-Tech (1972), RangaRaju et al. (1979), Hager (1982), Uyumaz and Smith (1991), Jalili and Borghei (1996), Borghei et al. (1999), Khorchani and Blanpain (2004), Vatankhah and Bijankhan (2009), Emiroglu et al. (2010, 2011), Bagheri and Heidarpour (2012), Novak et al. (2013), Mohammed (2013) studied the hydraulic behavior of the side weir flow. Additionally, various studies were carried out related to trapezoidal channels along the side weir. For instance, Cheong (1991) presented an equation in order to compute the discharge coefficient of side weirs located on trapezoidal conduit. Also, Vatankhah (2012 a) proposed an analytical solution to predict the variations of flow free surface along the side weir for subcritical and supercritical flow regimes. For U-shaped channels along the side weir, Uyumaz (1997) using the specific energy principles and the finite difference method provided an analytical solution for predicting variations of the flow free surface profile along the side weirs. Uyumaz, by conducting some experiments in both subcritical and supercritical flow conditions, showed an acceptable agreement between the experimental and mentioned method results. Vatankhah (2013) introduced a semi-analytical solution for predicting variations of the longitudinal profile of the flow free surface along the side weirs located on U-shaped channels. The method was based on the energy principles obtained by integration solution. Additionally, for triangular channels along the side weirs, Uyumaz (1992) presented an analytical solution for calculating variations of the flow free surface along the side weirs in subcritical and supercritical flow conditions. In addition, Vatankhah (2012 b) using integration and the principles of specific energy solved the governing dynamical equation on the passing flow over side <b>weirs</b> located on <b>triangular</b> channels. Vatankhah’s analytical method predicts the free surface flow profile along the side weir with an acceptable accuracy. Moreover, channels with circular cross section are used in urban sewage disposal networks and drainage systems. In association with circular channels along the side weirs, Allen (1957) conducted an experimental study on the hydraulic behavior of the passing flow over rectangular side weirs. Uyumaz and Muslu (1985) by assuming that the flow in the main channel is two dimensional and the pressure is hydrostatical predicted the longitudinal profile of the flow free surface along the side weir and the passing flow over it using the finite element method. Their analytical method for both supercritical and subcritical flow conditions was validated by experimental results. Ramamurthy et al. (1995) through the two-dimensional flow theory provided an analytical method for predicting the passing flow over a side weir located on a circular channel. They introduced the theoretical discharge coefficient of the side weir {{as a function of the}} geometric parameters of the side weir. Oliveto et al. (2001) investigated the characteristics of supercritical flow conditions along the side weirs located on circular channels. Their experiments have been focused on the local measurement of the flow output angle and the velocity along the side weir. In all experiments, the side weir upstream flow is subcritical and the flow along the side weir is supercritical. Vatankhah (2012 c) by the incomplete elliptic integrals method and the specific energy principle provided a semi-analytical solution for calculating the longitude profile of the flow free surface in both subcritical and supercritical flow conditions. In practice, it is possible that the flow along the side weir be supercritical. Many experimental and theoretical studies have been conducted on supercritical flows passing through channels with side weir. Hager (1994) provided an analytical method for supercritical flows passing through circular channels with side weir. His method is used in both flow conditions: with hydraulic jumps and without hydraulic jumps. He validated the obtained results from his analytical method by the experimental results obtained by other researches. Ghodsian (2003) investigated the passing supercritical flow over the side weir located on a rectangular channel. He introduced the elementary discharge coefficient of the side weir in supercritical flow conditions as a function of the ratio of the head above the weir to the weir crest height and the Froude number. Mizumura et al. (2003) provided an analytical solution for calculating the main channel discharge in a rectangular channel with side weir in supercritical flow conditions. Their analytical method was based on the energy principles, and the main channel discharge was introduced as a function of the Froude number. Pathirana et al. (2006) conducted an experimental study including investigation of the upstream specific energy, the discharge coefficient and the passing flow over the side weir in supercritical flow conditions for a rectangular channel equipped with a side weir. Using the specific energy principles and the regression analysis, they provided a relationship for calculating the discharge coefficient of side weirs in supercritical flow conditions. Rao and Pillai (2008) investigated the discharge coefficient of the side weir, the velocity in the main channel, the flow falling angle from the side weir and measured the flow depth along the weir by conducting an experimental study on a rectangular channel with side weir in supercritical flow conditions. Coonrod et al. (2009) investigated the effect of guide vanes on increasing the diversion flow rate over side weirs located on rectangular channels in supercritical flow conditions. In recent years, computational fluids dynamics (CFD) has been introduced as a powerful tool for understanding the hydrodynamic behavior of fluids and the interaction between the fluid and the structure. Also, many studies were carried out in order to simulate the flow field of main channels along the side weir. For example, Qu (2005) modeled three-dimensional (3 D) changes of the flow in rectangular channels along the side weir using the k - ω turbulence model and the volume of fluid (VOF) scheme. Tadayon (2009) developed a numerical model to simulate the flow field within rectangular conduits along the side weir. The numerical model simulated the flow turbulence and variations of the flow free surface with the RSM turbulence model and the VOF method, respectively. Aydin (2012) using the FLUENT software simulated the flow free surface within a rectangular channel along the <b>triangular</b> labyrinth side <b>weir</b> by the VOF scheme. Aydin and Emiroglu (2013) using the ANSYS FLUENT software simulated the discharge capacity of labyrinth side weirs. They modeled the free surface changes by the VOF method and the flow turbulence by different turbulence models. Furthermore, they showed that the discharge coefficient increased by increasing the Froude number. Azimi et al. (2014) simulated the velocity field along the side weir in circular channels using RNG k - ε and VOF scheme. Also, Azimi and Shabanlou (2015) modeled the flow pattern in triangular channels along the side weir. The effect of the Froude number was examined on the characteristics of the flow field.|$|R
