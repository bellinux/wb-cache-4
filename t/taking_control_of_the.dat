5|$|In 1884, Speyer {{became a}} partner {{in each of his}} father's businesses. He headed the Frankfurt office before <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> London office, Speyer Brothers, in 1887. His older brother, James, headed the New York company. The firm {{specialised}} in arbitrage with Europe and the United States, and the financing of railway projects. On 29 February 1892, Speyer became a naturalised British citizen.|$|E
5|$|In November 2012, {{shortly after}} {{entering}} office, Rivers {{was appointed to}} the Republican leadership as the minority whip. When the Majority Coalition Caucus was formed, <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Senate away from the Democrats, Rivers was promoted to majority whip. It is rare for a freshman senator to be appointed to party leadership.|$|E
5|$|The chained {{slaves were}} packed under {{the deck of}} a small vessel named The Schooner York to be shipped to the island (other sources say the voyage took place aboard The Morovia). During this voyage the Igbo slaves rose up in rebellion, <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship and {{drowning}} their captors in the process causing the grounding of the Morovia in Dunbar Creek at the site now locally known as Igbo Landing.|$|E

5|$|After {{scoring a}} safety touch, the scoring team has {{the option of}} <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ball and {{beginning}} play from their own 35-yard line, kicking the ball off from their 35-yard line, or accepting a kickoff from the 25-yard line {{of the team that}} conceded the score. If a kickoff is chosen it must be a place kick, and the ball can be held, placed on the ground, or placed on a tee prior to the kick. As in American football, the ball must go at least ten yards before it can be recovered by the kicking team.|$|E
5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably responsive caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interaction.|$|E
5|$|Despite that failure, in 1925 {{a similar}} bill passed both the House and Senate, which {{allowed for the}} {{creation}} of the National Capital Parks Commission (NCPC) to oversee the construction of a Fort Circle of parks similar to that proposed in 1919. The duty of purchasing land and constructing the fort parks changed hands several times throughout the 1920s and 1930s, eventually culminating with the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project in the 1940s. By the time the site of Fort Bayard was purchased in 1926, the remains of the fort had been demolished and homes were being built on the site.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} eighteenth century Scotland gained many of the organisations {{associated}} with the revival in England, including Sunday schools, mission schools, ragged schools, Bible societies and improvement classes. Because the revival occurred {{at the same time as}} the transformation of the Highlands into a crofting society, Evangelicalism was often linked to popular protest against patronage and the clearances, while the Moderates became identified with the interests of the landholding classes. It laid the ground for the Great Disruption in the mid-nineteenth century, leading to the Evangelicals <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly and those in the Highlands joining the Free Church of Scotland in large numbers.|$|E
5|$|In <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studio, General Tire {{restored}} RKO's {{links to}} broadcasting. General Tire {{had bought the}} Yankee Network, a New England regional radio network, in 1943. In 1950, it purchased the West Coast regional Don Lee Broadcasting System, and two years later, the Bamberger Broadcasting Service, owner of the WOR TV and radio stations in New York City. The latter acquisition gave General Tire majority control of the Mutual Broadcasting System, one of America's leading radio networks. General Tire then merged its broadcasting interests into a new division, General Teleradio.|$|E

5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Nine is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} primarily {{set in a}} cyberspace version of 1990s Tokyo, with players <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> silent main protagonist to explore various environments within Tokyo's districts, along with switching between different districts with a dedicated fast-travel menu. The player can adjust the protagonist's name, gender, hair and skin color. Navigation through environments is presented through a third-person perspective, with the player character being followed by one assigned demon. While navigating safe areas, players can enter shops to buy new equipment and items such as healing potions, and change their character's clothing and hairstyle.|$|E
5|$|The first {{fighting}} between US troops and Yavapai came in early 1837, when the Tolkepaya joined with their Quechan neighbors {{to defend against}} Major Samuel Heintzelman over a Quechan ferry crossing on the Colorado River. The Quechan used the ferry to transport settlers over the river, into California. After they killed a group led by John Glanton, who {{had taken over the}} crossing, the US government retaliated by burning the fields of the Quechans, and <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crossing.|$|E
5|$|The initial Western {{release of}} the game, while keeping the basic plot the same, {{significantly}} changed some details from the original Japanese manual. In this version, Dr. Light and Dr. Wily (here Light's assistant turned disloyal) co-create the humanoid robot Mega Man alongside the six advanced robots, each of whom were designed {{for the benefit of}} Monsteropolis's citizens (no such place existed in the original plot). Dr. Wily grows disloyal of his partner and reprograms these six robots to aid himself in <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world, creating the seven empires of Monsteropolis. Dr. Light sends Mega Man to destroy his fellow creations and stop Dr. Wily.|$|E

50|$|Spanish missionary and conquistador {{documents}} chronicle skirmishes {{between the}} Spanish colonizers {{and the local}} peoples. In 1524, for example, a large battle between Hernán Cortés and an army of 10,000 to 20,000 Indians resulted in Cortés <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ameca valley. The valley was then named Banderas (flags) after the colorful standards carried by the natives.|$|R

5|$|The port of Antwerp was an {{important}} strategic objective because Allied supply lines were heavily stretched and needed a deep-sea port near the front lines. The British Second Army liberated Antwerp on September 6, {{with help from the}} local resistance. Despite <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city, the port was not accessible until the surrounding waters were safe for cargo ships. The Germans successfully denied access to the port until the Battle of the Scheldt completed in November.|$|E
5|$|With the {{declaration}} of war against Sweden on 2 September 1675, Denmark saw a chance to regain its recently lost eastern provinces. The southern Baltic became an important strategic theatre for both Denmark and Sweden. Denmark needed the sea lanes to invade Scania, and Sweden needed to reinforce Swedish Pomerania on the Baltic coast; both stood to gain by <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baltic trade routes. As war broke out between Denmark and Sweden a strong naval presence also became essential for Sweden to secure its interests at home and overseas.|$|E
5|$|A {{golf course}} was {{constructed}} alongside the castle in 1900, and the estate was later sold to Sir Arthur Sutherland, a wealthy shipowner, in 1919. Sutherland opened an additional {{course at the}} castle in 1922, designed by the Scottish golfer, James Braid. The costs of maintaining the property became {{too much for him}} and, after undertaking eight years of clearance work in the 1920s, he placed the castle into the guardianship of the state in 1930, with the Commissioners of Works <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> property. Archaeological investigations were carried out as part of the clearance work by H. Honeyman in 1929, exposing more of the main gatehouse, and further work was carried out under Robert Bosanquet in the 1930s. Aerial photography was carried out by Walter de Aitchison for the Ordnance Survey.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Messolonghi, Western Europe decided to {{intervene}} in favour of revolutionary Greece. Their attitude toward the Ottoman Empire's Egyptian ally, Ibrahim Pasha, was especially critical; their primary objective was to elicit the evacuation of the occupied regions, the Peloponnese in particular. The intervention began when a Franco-Russo-British fleet {{was sent to the}} region, winning the Battle of Navarino in October 1827. In August 1828, a French expeditionary corps disembarked at Koroni in the southern Peloponnese. The soldiers were stationed on the peninsula until the evacuation of Egyptian troops in October, then <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> principal strongholds still held by Turkish troops. Although the bulk of the troops returned to France from the end of 1828, there was a French presence in the area until 1833.|$|E
5|$|After the referendum, Lukashenko {{convened a}} new {{parliamentary}} assembly from those {{members of the}} parliament who were loyal to him. After between ten and twelve deputies withdrew their signature from the impeachment petition, only about forty deputies of the old parliament were left and the Supreme Soviet was dismissed by Lukashenko. Nevertheless, international organizations and many Western countries do not recognize the current parliament given {{the way it was}} formed. At the start of 1998, the Central Bank of Russia suspended trading in the Belarusian ruble, which led to a collapse {{in the value of the}} currency. Lukashenko responded by <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, sacking the entire bank leadership and blaming the West for the free fall of the currency.|$|E
5|$|Despite that failure, in 1925 {{a similar}} bill passed both the House and Senate, which {{allowed for the}} {{creation}} of the National Capital Parks Commission (NCPC) to oversee the construction of a Fort Circle of parks similar to that proposed in 1919. The NCPC was authorized to begin purchasing land occupied by the old forts, much of which had been turned over to private ownership following the war. Records indicate that the site of Fort Stanton was purchased for a total of $56,000 in 1926. The duty of purchasing land and constructing the fort parks changed hands several times throughout the 1920s and 1930s, eventually culminating with the Department of the Interior and the National Park Service <b>taking</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project in the 1940s.|$|E
