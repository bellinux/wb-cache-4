25|$|One unique view, {{which does}} not neatly fall into either of the cultural- or connectivity-gap categories, centers on the {{organizational}} differences {{between the military and}} civilian societies. This view claims to explain much as to why <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> or may be used to press ahead of society's norms. This view goes beyond the simpler cultural-gap approach and emphasizes the ability of the military society to control the behavior and attitudes of its members in ways not possible in the more open civilian society, as evidenced by such phenomena as desegregation of the military and inclusion of women in the military.|$|E
25|$|Kelly’s {{background}} in <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> suggested {{as a source}} of the seriousness of his works. While serving time in the army, Kelly was exposed to and influenced by the camouflage with which his specific battalion worked. This taught him about the use of form and shadow, as well as the construction and deconstruction of the visible. It was fundamental to his early education as an artist. Ralph Coburn, a friend of Kelly's from Boston, introduced him to the technique of automatic drawing while visiting in Paris. Kelly embraced this technique of making an image without looking at the sheet of paper. These techniques helped Kelly in loosening his drawing style and broadened his acceptance of what he believed to be art. During his last year in Paris, Kelly was ill and also suffered depression; Sims thought that influenced his predominant use of black and white during that period.|$|E

5000|$|The {{weakness}} of <b>the</b> Canadian <b>military</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{a factor in}} its very limited role in the 1991 Gulf War. While <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> asked about <b>the</b> feasibility of sending 4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group (4 CMBG) from Germany to the Gulf to participate in direct combat operations, the Canadian Forces were forced to report that Operation [...] "Broadsword", a theoretical deployment, would likely be a failure.|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to traditional defense roles, <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{called on to}} provide support to civil authorities for disaster relief and internal security. The military of Bangladesh fought tribal insurgents in Chittagong Hill Tracts since mid-1970s. In November 2008, Bangladesh Navy effectively staved off economic aggression by Myanmar in the seas of Bangladesh. Occasionally the military forces have been called to participate in social activities like rehabilitation of people following a flood or cyclone. Since late 1980s, it has earned international reputation by working as part of United Nations peacekeeping Missions in different countries of the world. The Bangladesh military is recognized as a disciplined and well-trained national institution that can tackle critical national phases. A 2,300-member Bangladesh Army contingent served with coalition forces during the 1991 Gulf war. Bangladesh is currently the second highest contributor (with 7941 troops, as of October 2013) to United Nations peacekeeping operations, with an infantry battalion in UNIKOM (Kuwait), an engineer battalion in UNTAET, (East Timor) and another infantry battalion service in Sierra Leone in May 2000.|$|E
2500|$|The need {{to monitor}} {{activities}} and warn of potential {{threats to the}} United States is not new. From conventional assaults to potential nuclear attacks, <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{at the forefront of}} monitoring and warning of potential dangers since the founding of the country. [...] Protecting the security and well being of the United States, including the critical Defense Infrastructure, has now entered a new era. It has been deemed essential to have a coordinated ability to identify and warn of potential or actual incidents among critical infrastructure domains. The ability to detect and warn of infrastructure events is the third phase of the critical infrastructure protection life cycle, the Indications and Warnings phase.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1947 and 1971, Pakistan {{has fought}} three direct {{conventional}} wars against India, with the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 witnessing the secession of East Pakistan as independent Bangladesh. In the latter war, the Pakistan Armed Forces {{were the main}} perpetrators of the Bangladesh genocide, in which, most independent researchers estimate, around 300,000 to 500,000 {{people were killed and}} 200,000 to 400,000 were raped, while the Bangladesh government claims the number of deaths was as high as 3,000,000. Rising tensions with Afghanistan in the 1960s and an indirect proxy war fought against the Soviet Union in the 1970s led to a sharp rise {{in the development of the}} Pakistan Armed Forces. In 1999, an extended period of intense border-skirmishing with India, the so-called Kargil War, resulted in a redeployment of forces. [...] <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> conducting counterinsurgency operations along the border areas of Afghanistan, while continuing to participate in several United Nations peacekeeping operations.|$|E
50|$|Bainimarama and Leweni {{expressed}} {{mixed feelings}} after the government's decision {{to increase its}} budget allocation to <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> to F$76.4 million was announced on 4 November. The figure represented a considerable increase on the F$67 million allocated in 2004, but fell short of the F$84 million <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> seeking. Because <b>the</b> <b>Military</b> <b>had</b> not <b>been</b> allocated all that they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> seeking, they would continue with their cost-cutting measures, Leweni said.|$|R
