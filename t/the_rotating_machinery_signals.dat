Compared with the spectrum analysis method via Fourier transformation, {{it is more}} effective for <b>the</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery</b> vibrating <b>signal</b> analysis. Extracting the rotor system fault feature frequency from Hilbert marginal spectrum can not only enhance the frequency resolution, but also remove other unrelated frequency component, {{so as to make}} the spectrum peak of the fault feature frequency more obviously, and the analysis diagnosis results more accurately. This method result is applied to the fault {{feature extraction}} and diagnosis of the rotor system, and the analysis results of the experiment signal verify the validity of this method...|$|R
40|$|Targeting the {{characteristics}} that periodic impulses usually occur whilst <b>the</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery</b> exhibits local faults and the limitations of singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques, the SVD technique based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) {{is applied to the}} fault feature extraction of <b>the</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery</b> vibration <b>signals.</b> <b>The</b> EMD method is used to decompose the vibration signal into a number of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) by which the initial feature vector matrices could be formed automatically. By applying the SVD technique to the initial feature vector matrices, the singular values of matrices could be obtained, which could be used as the fault feature vectors of support vector machines (SVMs) classifier.

40|$|Sensors play an {{important}} role in the modern manufacturing and industrial processes. Their reliability is vital to ensure reliable and accurate information for condition based maintenance. For the gearbox, the critical machine component in <b>the</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery,</b> <b>the</b> vibration <b>signals</b> collected by sensors are usually noisy. At the same time, the fault detection results based on the vibration signals from a single sensor may be unreliable and unstable. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an intelligent multi-sensor data fusion method using the relevance vector machine (RVM) based on an ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO-RVM) for gearboxes’ fault detection. RVM is a sparse probability model based on support vector machine (SVM). RVM not only has higher detection accuracy, but also better real-time accuracy compared with SVM. The ACO algorithm is used to determine kernel parameters of RVM. Moreover, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is applied to preprocess the raw vibration signals to eliminate the influence caused by noise and other unrelated signals. The distance evaluation technique (DET) is employed to select dominant features as input of the ACO-RVM, so that the redundancy and inference in a large amount of features can be removed. Two gearboxes are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the ACO-RVM has higher fault detection accuracy than the RVM with normal the cross-validation (CV) ...|$|R

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} demand for electrical energy {{has meant that}} electrical power systems have evolved to be the highly complex networks that are in existence today, where the transient interactions that take place between large synchronous generators have {{been the focus of}} advanced research for many decades. More recently, the proliferation of synchronous and asynchronous generators of comparatively small rating, which are not centrally planned, has added new impetus to this area of research. At a time when not only technical but also economic and environmental concerns must be carefully assessed, more realistic models of the individual power plant transient response and its interaction {{with the rest of the}} network become mandatory to achieve more accurate analysis of the network operation and prevent wastage of technical and economical resources. The main thrust of this research project is to develop comprehensive models of <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery</b> with which to assess the transient response of electrical power networks that undergo severe unbalanced operation due to faulty conditions developing anywhere in the power network, including <b>the</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery’s</b> windings. To achieve an unrivalled speed of response, a nodal-based model of the electrical power network has been developed, enabling the study of power networks of any size and topological formation with the utmost flexibility and efficiency. <b>The</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery</b> addressed in this research work is the three-phase synchronous generator and the three-phase asynchronous (induction) machine. In multi-machine power systems transient studies, it is common to look at all <b>the</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery</b> in <b>the</b> network as being healthy units having an idealized sinusoidally distributed stator winding – the possibility of a severe unbalanced condition internal to the machine due to internal fault or the effect of space harmonics, has, so far, not been addressed in a multi-machine environment. In this research work, new EMTP type models, with enhanced numerical properties, are constructed for the simulation of internal and external machine fault phenomena with different levels of details including the effects of saturation and space harmonics. Advanced numerical methods are employed to improve on the numerical stability of the network model allowing the use of larger time steps than what otherwise is possible with traditional numerical methods, enabling the new model to execute faster than existing models and yet to exhibit the same degree of numerical accuracy with an unrivalled degree of modelling flexibility. A case in point is an application made to model the transient response of a Variable Frequency Transformer (VFT) undergoing internal faults on its stator side. <b>The</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery</b> models with internal fault representation developed in this research lend themselves to an application in the area of condition monitoring, where a new method is developed to detect internal faults in the stator side of three phase <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery.</b> <b>The</b> method is shown to be highly effective when applied to machines operating in an isolated environment as well as in a multi-machine power system, performing very well when applied to different types of equipment and various kinds of internal faults...|$|R

The total time elapsed for the entire momentum due to sustained operation of <b>the</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>machinery</b> to dissipate is known as Coast Down Time (CDT). The characteristic profile of CDT (CDT-P) depends on inertia forces of the machinery components, tribological behaviour and environmental effects such as fluid drag.

A review of current literature has given a clear understanding to what extent the CDP has been explored with respect to utilising it as a diagnostic parameter. However no evidence for effective use of CDT in condition based monitoring programmes can be found. The main focus of this research is concentrated on ascertaining the validity of Coast Down Time as one of the condition monitoring parameters for a horizontal rotor system. Extensive experimental analysis is conducted on a rotor system consisting of a journal bearing using different lubricants under various mechanical and operating conditions An empirical formula is developed to determine the Coast Down Factor (CDF).
