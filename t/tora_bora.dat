5|$|December 2001: During {{the opening}} {{stages of the}} war in Afghanistan {{launched}} following the September 11 attacks, the U.S. and its allies believed that bin Laden was hiding in the rugged mountains at <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora.</b> Despite overrunning the Taliban and al-Qaeda positions, they failed to capture or kill him.|$|E
5|$|In late 2004, 3rd Battalion was {{notified}} {{it would be}} participating in Operation Enduring Freedom. On 31 October, the first Marines left Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii for an eight-month deployment to eastern Afghanistan. While serving in Afghanistan, 3rd Battalion conducted Operation Spurs in February 2005, where they were inserted into the Korangal valley and conducted both counterinsurgency and humanitarian operations. In March, 3rd Battalion launched a similar sweep called Operation Mavericks. During their time in Afghanistan, the Marines from 3rd Battalion engaged the Taliban in 22 firefights. In one of them the battalion suffered its only fatalities for the deployment when LCPL Nicholas Kirven and Corporal Richard Schoener were killed during a three-hour firefight in Alishang which also resulted in twenty-three Taliban killed. During the fighting, Lieutenant Stephen Boada was awarded the Silver Star for calmly directing bombing runs on Taliban positions, despite having been wounded several times. In May the battalion launched one final operation, Operation Celtics, in the <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> region. The operation was {{for the most part}} uneventful, although NBC news journalist Ron Allen was almost killed while traveling with Kilo Company when his Humvee ran over an IED.|$|E
5|$|USSOCOM's 10th Special Forces Group, {{elements}} of JSOC and CIA/SAD Paramilitary Officers linked {{up again and}} {{were the first to}} enter Iraq prior to the invasion. Their efforts organized the Kurdish Peshmerga to defeat Ansar Al Islam in Northern Iraq before the invasion. This battle was for control of a territory in Northeastern Iraq that was completely occupied by Ansar Al Islam, an ally of Al Qaeda. This was a very significant battle and led to the termination of a substantial number of terrorists and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat. These terrorists {{would have been in the}} subsequent insurgency had they not been eliminated during this battle. Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war. This battle may have been the <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> of Iraq, but it was a sound defeat for Al Qaeda and their ally Ansar Al Islam. This combined team then led the Peshmerga against Saddam's northern Army. This effort kept Saddam's forces in the north and denied the ability to redeploy to contest the invasion force coming from the south. This effort may have saved the lives of hundreds if not thousands of coalition service men and women.|$|E

5000|$|David Hagberg (* 9. October 1942 in Duluth, Minnesota) is an American novelist {{best known}} for his techno-thrillers {{featuring}} super-spy Kirk McGarvey. Hagberg has also written under the pseudonym Sean Flannery, Nick Carter, David Bannerman, David James, Robert Pell, and Eric Ramsey. Hagberg's style {{has been described as a}} cross between Tom Clancy and Ian Fleming. His thrillers generally feature a combination of technical detail, timely plots and super-spy heroics that are sometimes almost prophetic in their accuracy [...] In the novel Joshua's Hammer, for example, written in 2000, Hagberg gives a chilling account of a mega-terrorist plot by Osama bin Laden to kill thousands of Americans on their home soil, published a full year before the World Trade Center Attacks. His scenario of McGarvey tracking bin Laden to his urban lair in Pakistan and shooting him in the head—far from <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora’s</b> caves—was described and executed in Allah’s Scorpion (2007) four years before the eerily similar event echoed Hagberg’s novel.|$|R
5|$|In November 2001, C and M {{squadron}} SBS had {{an extensive}} {{role in the}} invasion of Afghanistan {{at the start of}} the War in Afghanistan, notably, members of M squadron were involved in the Battle of <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora.</b> The SBS was integrated directly into Task Force Sword – a Black SOF, under direct command of JSOC, this was a so-called hunter-killer force whose primary objective was capturing or killing senior leadership and HVT within both al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Troops from C squadron (reinforced by teams from X and Z squadron, with at least one SEAL attached to them) were tasked with several missions, some with General Dostum's Northern Alliance forces at Mazar-e-Sharif. On November 10, C squadron inserted into the recently captured Bagram Airbase, which caused an immediate political quandary with the Northern Alliance leadership which claimed that the British had failed to consult them on it before the deployment, in addition to fighting with Dostum's forces, they worked alongside TF Sword in Shah-i-Kot Valley. Members of M squadron SBS, were involved in a prison revolt during the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi, members of the SBS along with US and Northern Alliance troops eventually quelled the uprising, however during one CAS mission, a misdirected JDAM bomb wounded 4 SBS personnel to various degrees. In appreciation for the SBS contribution to the battle, the CIA attempted to recognise the personnel with US decorations, but due to Military and political bureaucracy, the decorations were never awarded. The SBS continued to work with Task Force Sword and the CIA.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> in June 2017 was a {{military}} engagement for the cave complex of <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> and its surroundings in Afghanistan. Fighting took place between the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIL-K) and forces opposed to it, namely the Taliban, militias formed by {{the population of the}} Pachir Aw Agam District, and the Afghan National Army. After heavy clashes ISIL-K forces initially succeeded in capturing <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> from the Taliban on 13-14 June 2017, but Afghan government forces retook the cave complex by 17 June.|$|E
25|$|In July 2017, the Afghan National Directorate of Security financed {{and armed}} a new militia of around 300 locals from Pachir Aw Agam District to combat ISIL-K {{in the area}} around <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora.</b> Meanwhile, ISIL-K had renewed its {{operations}} in the <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> region, reportedly raiding and destroying local Taliban outposts.|$|E
25|$|Despite this setback, ISIL-K soon regrouped and renwed their offensive. Calls by {{the locals}} for the {{government}} to provide aid to them went unheeded, and on late 13 June the Islamic State fighters eventually managed to capture much territory around <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> after fierce fighting against both the local militias as well as the Taliban. On early 14 June, the Taliban defenses at the mountain stronghold completely collapsed, and the group's fighters fled from the area. Without the Taliban forces to support them, the local militias of <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> were no longer able to hold their lands, and also retreated, taking their families with them. Though both Taliban as well as some pro-government sources denied that all of <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> had fallen to ISIL-K, and maintained that Taliban elements still held out in the region, local villagers as well as the Afghan military reported that the Islamic State forces had set up their flag and heavy artillery on the mountains over <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora.</b>|$|E
25|$|Before the Taliban could {{launch a}} counter-attack, however, President Ashraf Ghani ordered the Afghan National Army's 201st Corps to launch their own {{offensive}} against <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> on 14 June. The army quickly moved against ISIL-K, and by 16 June had reportedly begun {{to push the}} militants back. On the next day, the Afghan National Army stormed the <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> cave complex from {{the foot of the}} mountains, while Commandos were airdropped onto the mountain peaks. The stronghold quickly fell, while the Afghan government forces proceeded with clearing operations in the area and its surroundings. On 25 June, the Afghan Ministry of Defense officially declared that ISIL-K had been completely evicted from the area around <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora,</b> and that the cave system would be turned into a military base of the Afghan military.|$|E
25|$|Bin Laden's {{location}} and {{state of health}} were a continuing topic of speculation since his disappearance from <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora.</b> It has become clear {{that most of these}} rumors and speculation were not based on fact. First, rumors surfaced that bin Laden was killed or fatally injured during U.S. bombardments, most notably near <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora,</b> or that he died of natural causes. According to Gary Berntsen, in his 2005 book, , a number of al-Qaeda detainees later confirmed that bin Laden had escaped <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> into Pakistan via an eastern route through snow-covered mountains in the area of Parachinar, Pakistan. The media reported that bin Laden suffered from a kidney disorder requiring him to have access to advanced medical facilities, possibly kidney dialysis. Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda's second-in-command and a close bin Laden associate, is a physician and may have provided medical care to bin Laden.|$|E
25|$|The Pachir Aw Agam District, where <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> is located, {{was home}} to both Taliban as well as {{government}} followers, and thus quickly became a target for ISIL-K, which began to terrorize the district's population through killings, abductions, raids and looting. As result, the locals became extremely hostile and opposed to ISIL-K. On 13 April 2017, the United States bombed and largely destroyed the cave systems in Achin District that were used by ISIL-K as main base. As result, the group was deprived of its sanctuary; according to Afghan politician and former warlord Hazrat Ali, this caused ISIL-K to seek a new refuge. Probably due to its strategic location the Islamic State militants chose <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> as prospective new headquarters, and moved to capture it from the Taliban.|$|E
25|$|Bigelow and Boal had {{initially}} worked on and finished a screenplay {{centered on the}} December 2001 Battle of <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora,</b> and the long, unsuccessful efforts to find Osama bin Laden in the region. The two were about to begin filming when news broke that bin Laden had been killed.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Atef gave Khalid Sheikh Mohammed {{details for}} a contact in Brazil. When Mohammed {{returned}} to Afghanistan, {{he turned to}} Atef {{to set up a}} meeting with Bin Laden in <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora,</b> at which he told the pair his plans for military attacks against the United States.|$|E
25|$|On May 4, 2002, Operation Torii is launched, and Lieutenant-Colonel Stogran leads an {{international}} task force, of which 400 Canadian soldiers. The {{goal of the}} mission was to discover networks of caves used by the Talibans and Al-Qaeda, {{as well as to}} gather intelligence in the <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> region.|$|E
25|$|The unit's {{creation}} {{stems from}} {{the need to provide}} infantry support to the United Kingdom Special Forces, which became evident after the Battle of <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> during which two Special Boat Service (SBS) squadrons assaulted the al-Qaeda cave complex. Previously, this support was carried out on an ad hoc basis, with infantry units assisting special forces teams when needed.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the US using its special forces and {{providing}} air support for the Northern Alliance ground forces, both Taliban and al-Qaeda training camps were destroyed, and much of the operating structure of al-Qaeda {{is believed to have been}} disrupted. After being driven from their key positions in the <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> area of Afghanistan, many al-Qaeda fighters tried to regroup in the rugged Gardez region of the nation.|$|E
25|$|Prior to September 2009, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) {{headquarters}} in Afghanistan {{had at least}} seven bars that served tax-free beer and wine, including a sport bar named <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora.</b> In 2009, after news {{of the death of}} 125 civilians in air strikes, General Stanley McChrystal, the head of ISAF, tried to contact troop officials. After finding that some troops were unable to adequately respond to the incident because they were drunk, he banned alcohol from the US premises. This applies as well to foreign soldiers.|$|E
25|$|In January 2016, President Obama sent a {{directive}} to the Pentagon {{to make it}} easier for the military to get approval for strikes in Afghanistan, targeting militias that have sworn allegiance to the Islamic State. For 3 weeks in that month, the United States military carried out at least a dozen operations, including commando raids and airstrikes, many of these raids and strikes taking place in the <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> region of Nangarhar Province. American commanders in Afghanistan said they believed that between 90 and 100 Islamic State militants had been killed in these recent operations.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, in October 2001, U.S. forces (with UK and {{coalition}} allies) invaded Afghanistan {{to oust the}} Taliban regime. On 7 October 2001, the official invasion began with British and U.S. forces conducting airstrike campaigns over enemy targets. Kabul, {{the capital city of}} Afghanistan, fell by mid-November. The remaining al-Qaeda and Taliban remnants fell back to the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, mainly <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora.</b> In December, Coalition forces (the U.S. and its allies) fought within that region. It is believed that Osama bin Laden escaped into Pakistan during the battle.|$|E
25|$|Osama bin Laden, {{the founder}} and former leader of al-Qaeda, went into hiding {{following}} {{the start of the}} War in Afghanistan in order to avoid capture by the United States and/or its allies {{for his role in the}} September 11, 2001 attacks, and having been on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list since 1999. After evading capture at the Battle of <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> in December 2001, his whereabouts became unclear, and various rumours about his health, continued role in al-Qaeda, and location were circulated. Bin Laden also released several video and audio recordings during this time.|$|E
25|$|By 2004, {{additional}} battalions {{were stationed}} by General Musharraf to help curb infiltration into Pakistan through its porous border. The Military Intelligence, Covert Action Division (CAD) and army troops founds many caves and tunnels in White Mountain range {{used by the}} foreign fighters before the military action took place. The Military Intelligence accounts maintained that the tunnels were led into Afghanistan, possible <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> region. Though {{it is difficult to}} know how effective the cordon was on the first night of the military suspension but the military intelligence accounts did confirm that many high-value foreign fighters might have escaped through these tunnels and caves back to Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|In late 2008 {{and early}} 2009 Knox-Johnston {{took part in}} a BBC {{programme}} called Top Dogs: Adventures in War, Sea and Ice. The programme saw him unite with fellow British legends Sir Ranulph Fiennes, the adventurer, and John Simpson, the BBC world affairs editor. The team went on three trips, each experiencing each other's adventure field. The first episode, aired on 27 March 2009, saw Knox-Johnston, Fiennes and Simpson go on a potentially very dangerous news-gathering trip to Afghanistan. The team reported from the legendary Khyber Pass and infamous <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> mountain complex. The three also undertook a voyage around Cape Horn and an expedition hauling sledges across the deep-frozen Frobisher Bay in the far north of Canada.|$|E
500|$|Efforts {{to kill or}} capture al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden failed as {{he escaped}} a battle in December 2001 in the mountainous region of <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora,</b> which the Bush Administration later {{acknowledged}} to have resulted from a failure to commit enough U.S. ground troops. It was not until May 2011, two years after Bush left office, that bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces under the Obama administration. [...] Bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, remains at large.|$|E
500|$|In France, {{as many as}} [...] "80% {{percent of}} the Islamist extremists have come from Tablighi ranks, {{prompting}} French intelligence officers to call Tablighi Jamaat the 'antechamber of fundamentalism.'" [...] Among {{those who have been}} members of TJ in France are Zacarias Moussaoui (the only person to be charged in the United States in the September 11 attacks), Hervé Djamel Loiseau, a young Frenchman who died fleeing the 2001 American bombardment of <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> in Afghanistan, and Djamel Beghal, an Algerian-born Frenchman and admitted member of Al Qaeda who was convicted in 2005 of plotting to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Paris. In a foiled January 2008 bombing plot in Barcelona, Spain, [...] "some media reports" [...] stated that a Muslim leader in the city stated that the fourteen suspects arrested by police in a series of raids (where bomb-making materials were seized) were members of Tablighi Jamaat.|$|E
2500|$|After {{taking control}} of <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora,</b> ISIL-K {{proceeded}} to advance against {{the government in the}} wider Pachir Aw Agam District, with one commander of the group stating that [...] "We are in <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> {{but this is not the}} end. The plan is to take more territory from the government and the Taliban." [...] According to a local reporter of Voice of America, the whole district was on the verge of collapse. ISIL-K began to propagate its victory at <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> on its Radio Khilafat, while urging locals who had fled to return to their homes. According to security analyst and counter-terrorism expert David Otto, however, the area around <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> was so hostile to ISIL-K and the Taliban so entrenched there that the former group would not be able to hold it for long.|$|E

2500|$|Although <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora,</b> former {{stronghold of}} Osama bin Laden, was cleared of Taliban forces during a United States-led {{operation}} in 2001, the militant group soon retook the mountain stronghold. Since then, <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> has functioned as important {{base for the}} Taliban insurgency, while the area around it mostly fell under the group's influence. The Taliban's control over much of Nangarhar Province's hinterland was challenged upon the foundation of ISIL-K in 2015, however, and the two militant organizations began a brutal conflict for dominance. Meanwhile, the Afghan government's control in these remote areas was mostly limited to some outposts and population centers. Nevertheless, pro-government self-defense groups and tribal militias did emerge to fight against all insurgent groups in the area.|$|E
2500|$|After Begg's release, Bryan Whitman, a Defense Department spokesman, said of Begg: [...] "He has strong, {{long-term}} ties {{to terrorism}} — as a sympathizer, as a recruiter, as a financier {{and as a}} combatant". Whitman quoted from a single-spaced eight-page confession that Begg had signed while incarcerated in Bagram: [...] "I was armed and prepared to fight alongside the Taliban and al-Qaeda against the U.S. and others, and eventually retreated to <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> to flee from U.S. forces when our front lines collapsed".|$|E
2500|$|Writer Boal {{has stated}} his {{interest}} in making the original film on the 2001 <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> hunt for bin Laden that he and Bigelow conceived. That finished screenplay had been set aside after bin Laden was killed in 2011 {{to focus on what}} became Zero Dark Thirty. [...] "I love reporting, so being on a big story is really exciting to me," [...] said Boal, a former war journalist, of his scramble to write a new script after the event. [...] "But nobody likes to throw out two years of work." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Allied {{attack on}} Afghanistan began in October 2001, and, {{following}} {{the fall of}} the Taliban, a US Justice Department dossier on Begg alleges that he joined their retreat to the <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> mountains. The Pentagon claims that he was “prepared to fight in the front line against allied forces”. [...] He says that he and his family intended to evacuate to Islamabad in Pakistan for safety. Initially he became separated from his family in Afghanistan, he and several other men were guided over the mountains into western Pakistan, and he was reunited with his family in Pakistan by mid-November.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Battle of <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> (lit. Black Caves), formal troop deployment was begun by the Pakistan Army, {{at the behest of}} the Pakistan Government, in 2002. The conservative parties, most notably the Pakistan Muslim League, were very critical of such troop deployments in the region. The XI Corps, under its commander Lieutenant-General Jan Aurkzai, entered the Tirah Valley in the Khyber Agency for the first time since Pakistan's independence in 1947. The army troops later moved into the Shawal Valley of North Waziristan, eventually entering South Waziristan. A monitoring reconnaissance base was established by the Special Service Group [...] in 2003. Criticism of Musharraf and the United States grew in Peshawar by a massive communist party in 2003, demanding an end to the operations.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 March 2004, {{a bloody}} mountainous {{battle between the}} Pakistan Army troops and the foreign fighters of al-Qaeda was fought in the White Mountains of South Waziristan. The Pakistani media speculated that Pakistan Army had {{surrounded}} a [...] "high value target" [...] in the mountainous region, possibly al-Qaeda's then-second-in-command Ayman al-Zawahiri. According to the military intelligence in 2004, all militants were Chechens, Uzbeks, and Tajiks {{who were trying to}} flee Black Caves (<b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> of Afghanistan). After a week of the battle, the entire area was captured and as many as 400 al-Qaeda operatives were apprehended by the Pakistan Army. In spite of its success, the army failed to capture Zawahiri. The ISPR later admitted that it was Soviet Uzbek Tohir Yo‘ldosh who was surrounded, not Zawahiri.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2001, SAD/SOG and the Army's Delta Force {{tracked down}} Osama bin Laden in the rugged {{mountains}} near the Khyber Pass in Afghanistan. [...] Former CIA station chief Gary Berntsen {{as well as}} a subsequent Senate investigation claimed that the combined American special operations task force was largely outnumbered by al-Qaeda forces and that they were denied additional US troops by higher command. [...] The task force also requested munitions to block the avenues of egress of bin Laden, but that request was also denied. [...] The team allegedly uncovered evidence in the subsequent site exploration that bin Laden's ultimate aim was to obtain and detonate a nuclear device in a terrorist attack. According to other press reports, SAD were ineffectual and [...] "Bin Laden and bodyguards walked uncontested out of <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> and disappeared into Pakistan's unregulated tribal area." ...|$|E
2500|$|New {{information}} of Bin Laden's location has been emerging {{since his death}} and the arrest of his wives. On {{the day of the}} 9/11 attacks, Bin Laden was at the Khaldan terrorist training camp near Khost, which he left during the night with several Al Qaeda and Taliban operatives after sending his wives and children away into Pakistan to hide out. Bin Laden arrived the following morning in Khandahar and lived in a Taliban-controlled safe house from September 12 to October 7, 2001. Shortly after the US-led war in Afghanistan began, Bin Laden traveled from Khandahar to Kabul where he lived in another Taliban safe house until November 12 when he was believed to have traveled to Jalalabad where he spent at least five days in another safe house. From Jalalabad, he traveled to the <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> region where he hid out from November 17 to December 12. He is believed to have crossed the border into Pakistan sometime in January 2002 and spent time in various Al Qaeda safehouses in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan between January and April 2002.|$|E
2500|$|October 18: A senior NATO {{official}} tells CNN about {{claims that}} bin Laden {{is alive and}} well, living comfortably {{in a house in}} the north-west of Pakistan and being protected by local people and elements of Pakistani intelligence. Stating that [...] "nobody in al Qaeda is living in a cave", the official stated the bin Laden was likely to have moved around in recent years in areas from the mountainous Chitral region in the far northwest, near the Chinese border, to the Kurram Valley bordering <b>Tora</b> <b>Bora</b> in Afghanistan. The official stated that Ayman al-Zawahiri is believed to be hiding close to bin Laden in houses in northwest Pakistan, but are not together. Another U.S. official stated that bin Laden and Zawahiri are [...] "somewhere in the tribal areas of Pakistan near the Afghanistan border," [...] but that their exact locations are unknown: [...] "If we knew where he was – in a house, an apartment, a villa or an underground cave or bunker – we would have gotten him; we can't rule out he may be in a cave one day and a house in a city on another." ...|$|E
