In order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry attack that they knew would follow, the Army of the Potomac's artillery, {{under the command of}} Brig. Gen. Henry Jackson Hunt, at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 U.S. cannons added to the din. The Army of Northern Virginia was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position.|$|E

The area, {{about a mile from}} the centre of the city, is a conservation area, but the buildings are in use as part of a local college.

25|$|United {{made their}} {{debut in the}} 2015 U.S. Open Cup three nights after the loss in Orlando, with the team's first ever trip to the Steel City to face the Pittsburgh Riverhounds. Pittsburgh {{proved to be a}} tough opponent, taking their MLS {{opposition}} into extra time, but D.C. United prevailed with two goals in the overtime period, to win 3–1, on goals by Coria, Opare and Deleon. United returned to RFK four nights later, where they rediscovered their home field winning ways, with yet another striking comeback, to defeat the New England Revolution, by a now very familiar 2–1 score. United fell behind in the first half, when one-time D.C. United striker, Charlie Davies put the visitors in front in the 10th minute. The home team struggled for much of the game, but salvaged a win on 2 second-half goals by Chris Rolfe. Espindola had the assist on the first goal, and Rolfe's game-winner came on a penalty kick. Fixture congestion forced Coach Ben Olsen to use a decidedly second-choice lineup on a midweek trip to Chicago, but the visiting team came away with a surprising 1–0 victory. The game-winner was scored in the 73rd minute, when Conor Doyle struck an absolute cannon of a shot <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> team's most impressive goal of the year to that point. United remained on the road with a trip to Toronto {{at the end of that}} week. The teams played to a 0-0 scoreless draw in very adverse weather conditions, with rain and very heavy winds. Despite being outplayed, United nearly won the game in the last minute, but Jairo Arrieta's bid for Goal of the Year, a bicycle attempt, was frantically tipped over the bar by Toronto FC goalie, Chris Konopka.|$|E

From 1947 to 1949 he was stationed on Okinawa with the 53d Fighter Group. At Okinawa in 1948, Jabara flew his first jet aircraft, the [...] Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star.

500|$|Louis XIII (r. 1610–1643) and Louis XIV (r. 1643–1715) both {{actively}} {{took part}} in touching ceremonies. The latter touched 1,600 people on Easter 1680. Voltaire (1694–1778) scornfully wrote {{that he had lost}} confidence in the royal touch upon hearing that a mistress of Louis XIV died of scrofula [...] "despite being very well touched by the king". After 1722, the sentence exclaimed by the king upon touching the infected changed to the more hopeful: [...] "The King touches you, may God heal you." [...] (...) The new formula, rather than implying that God would inevitably grant the monarch's wish, was a prayer {{that may or may not}} result in a cure. Louis XV (r. 1715–1774) was skeptical about the royal touch. He performed it early in his reign, but caused a scandal when he failed to summon the scrofulous at Eastertide in 1739 and never again touched the diseased. The custom was thus suspended for 36 years, until Louis XVI (r. 1774–1792) revived it at his coronation on 11 June 1775 by touching 2,400 people. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> only time he touched the scrofulous. At his coronation on 29 May 1825, Charles X (r. 1824–1830) touched 121 of his subjects; the royal touch was never again employed.|$|E

He subsequently spent six weeks in hospital. Gleeson said of that time, [...] "I spent six weeks in hospital staring at the ceiling. That was pretty much my sporting career done. Sport was {{a huge part of}} my life and <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> hardest thing I've ever gone through." [...] That accident was the coaching catalyst for Gleeson. In 1990 at just 22, Gleeson became the coach of the Warrnambool Mermaids in the Country Victorian Invitational Basketball League (CVIBL). In his first season as coach, he guided the Mermaids to the championship. In 1992, he was appointed Head Coach of the Warrnambool Seahawks, a position he held for two years. In 1993, he earned the role of Head Coach of the Victorian Basketball All Star Team.|$|E
2500|$|Revere's most {{personally}} challenging {{moment of}} his Civil War career came after the Battle of Chancellorsville when 'blame' was being assigned for the Union Army's loss. After charging the Confederate line, division commander Maj. Gen. Hiram Berry was mortally wounded and the command devolved on Revere. [...] In the chaos of a battle with no clear front line, Revere's decision to regroup his men, commanding them to reform at a point set by compass led to controversy. [...] This three-mile march, described by Revere as a [...] "regrouping effort" [...] and not a retreat, led to his being court-martialed. [...] Abraham Lincoln overturned the court's ruling and reinstated Revere but accepted Revere's resignation at the same time. As a lifelong member of the Democratic Party, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> best deal Revere could expect from a Republican administration. In response to this situation, Revere was voted {{the honor of the}} rank of Brevet Major General by the United States Congress in 1866.|$|E

Following a brief stint in the Shy Limbs, by 1968 Lake was involved with The Gods, based in Hatfield, which he described as [...] "a very poor training college", but the group secured a residency at the Marquee Club in London. Lake left the group in 1968 over creative differences as the band were to enter the recording studio.

[...] This is the Assembly of Book H, but debate, in version A, was opened by Thersites, not by Agamemnon, and Thersites proposed instant flight! <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> earlier version.|$|E
60|$|On {{the bench}} {{by his side}} sat an elderly gentleman with a {{drooping}} air of defiance <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> remaining vestige of self-respect in an individual who had ceased to defy successfully anybody or anything. His clothes could scarcely be called shabby, at least they passed muster in the half-light, but one’s imagination could not have pictured the wearer embarking on {{the purchase of a}} half-crown box of chocolates or laying out ninepence on a carnation buttonhole. He belonged unmistakably to that forlorn orchestra to whose piping no one dances; {{he was one of the}} world’s lamenters who induce no responsive weeping. As he rose to go Gortsby imagined him returning to a home circle where he was snubbed and of no account, or to some bleak lodging where his ability to pay a weekly bill was the beginning and end of the interest he inspired. His retreating figure vanished slowly into the shadows, and his place on the bench was taken almost immediately by a young man, fairly well dressed but scarcely more cheerful of mien than his predecessor. As if to emphasise the fact that the world went badly with him the new-corner unburdened himself of an angry and very audible expletive as he flung himself into the seat.|$|E

"I {{know you}} don't {{like to hear}} her mentioned," [...] said the marine, turning to the blacksmith, [...] "but I am bound {{to say that in}} course of the {{afternoon}} Miss Minturn came on deck several times, to ask if anything new had happened, and if I had seen a vessel.

As long as I was talking to her I didn't care a snap of my finger for the Water-devil. It is queer what an influence a beautiful woman has on a man, but it's so, and there's no use arguing about it. She said she had been puzzling her brains to find out what had stopped us, and she supposed it must be that we had run onto a shallow place and stuck fast in the mud, but thought it wonderful that there should be such a place so far from land. I agreed with her that it was wonderful, and added that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> reason the captain and the crew had been seized with a panic. But sensible people like herself and her father, I said, ought not to be troubled by such an occurrence, especially as the vessel remained in a perfectly sound condition.|$|E

On his way {{it had been in}} his face, and he determined now to keep it at his back, not because <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>the</b> way to safety, but because he could see more easily where he was going, and he thought by continuing steadily in one direction he might at last gain firm ground. His view extended but a few yards round him, and he soon found that his plan of proceeding in a straight line was impracticable. Often quagmires of black ooze, or spaces covered with light grass, which were, he found, still more treacherous, barred his way, and he was compelled to make considerable detours to the right or left in order to pass them. Sometimes widths of sluggish water were met with. For a long time Harry continued his way, leaping lightly from tuft to tuft, where the grass grew thickest, sometimes wading knee-deep in the slush and feeling carefully every foot lest he should get to a depth whence he should be unable to extricate himself. Every now and then he shouted {{at the top of his}} voice, in hopes that he might be heard by some human being. For hours he struggled on. He was now exhausted with his efforts, and the thickening darkness told him that day was fading. From the time he had left his horse he had met with no bush of sufficient height to afford him the slightest shelter.|$|E
