25|$|The {{rotation}} of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> {{is always the}} average of the rotations of the side sun gears. This is why if the driven roadwheels are lifted clear of the ground with the engine off, and the drive shaft is held (say, leaving the transmission in gear preventing <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> from turning inside the differential), manually rotating one driven roadwheel causes the opposite roadwheel to rotate in the opposite direction by the same amount.|$|E
25|$|Epicyclic gears {{are also}} called {{planetary}} gears because the axes {{of the planet}} gears revolve around the common axis {{of the sun and}} ring gears that they mesh with and roll between. In the image, the yellow shaft carries the sun gear which is almost hidden. The blue gears are called planet gears and the pink gear is <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> or annulus.|$|E
25|$|Thus, for example, {{if the car}} {{is making}} a turn to the right, the main ring gear may make 10 full {{rotations}}. During that time, the left wheel will make more rotations because it has farther to travel, and the right wheel will make fewer rotations as it has less distance to travel. The sun gears (which drive the axle half-shafts) will rotate at different speeds relative to <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> (one faster, one slower) by, say, 2 full turns each (4 full turns relative to each other), resulting in the left wheel making 12 rotations, and the right wheel making 8 rotations.|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a carrier-less, anti-backlash {{planetary gear system}} that has an input sun gear, a force-balancing and planet-alignment 'speeder' gear above the sun <b>gear,</b> a split <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> that has a fixed lower <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> coaxial with <b>the</b> sun gear and a rotating upper <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> also coaxial with the sun gear. A preload bolt is used for securing <b>the</b> split <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> together. Within <b>the</b> split <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> is an even number of planet <b>gears</b> between <b>the</b> split <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> and <b>the</b> sun gear. Each planet gear consists of an upper planet gear, and lower planet gear with {{the upper and lower}} planet gears splined together and pushed apart by a spring which causes separation and relative twist between the upper and lower planet gears. The lower planet gear meshes with the input sun <b>gear</b> and <b>the</b> fixed <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> while <b>the</b> upper planet gear is driven by the lower planet gear and meshes with <b>the</b> rotating <b>ring</b> <b>gear...</b>|$|R
30|$|The typical {{vibration}} modes also {{arise if}} the elastic components such as <b>the</b> thin <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> are considered [11, 12]. Wu and Parker [11] examined the PGT with elastic <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> and identified <b>the</b> rigid-elastic vibration modes, and later Parker and Wu [12] proved the vibration modes of the PGT with unequally-spaced planets and elastic <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Tanna and Lim [15, 16] examined <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear’s</b> free vibration and proved the elastic vibration modes, including in-plane extensional, radial inextensional, out-of-plane bending, and torsional deformations. It seems that similar modes {{to those in}} Refs. [11, 12] can be found for <b>the</b> helical planetary <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> even when considering various deformations owing to the symmetries. However, {{it could be a}} challenge to develop an analytical model incorporating many deformations. Even so, the theoretical analysis is another difficulty to be overcome.|$|R
50|$|The nut {{and screw}} have {{identical}} multiple-start threads. The rollers have a single-start thread with an angle matching the nut thread. The matched thread angle prevents axial movement between the nut and the roller as the rollers spin. The nut assembly includes spacer <b>rings</b> and <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> that position and guide the rollers. <b>The</b> spacer <b>rings,</b> which rotate within <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gears,</b> have equidistant holes {{that act as}} rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of <b>the</b> rollers. <b>The</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> time <b>the</b> spinning and orbit of the rollers about the screw axis by engaging gear teeth near {{the ends of the}} rollers. <b>The</b> spacer <b>rings</b> rotate on axis with the screw in unison with the orbit of the rollers. <b>The</b> spacer <b>rings</b> float relative to the nut, axially secured by retaining rings, because they spin around the screw at a lower frequency (angular velocity) than the nut.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} Reitwagen {{was destroyed}} in the Cannstatt Fire that razed the Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft Seelberg-Cannstatt plant in 1903, but several replicas exist in collections at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart, the Deutsches Museum in Munich, the Honda Collection Hall at the Twin Ring Motegi facility in Japan, the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in Ohio, and in Melbourne, Australia. The Deutsches Museum lent their replica to the Guggenheim Las Vegas The Art of the Motorcycle exhibition in 2001. The replicas vary as to which version they follow. The one at the AMA Hall of Fame {{is larger than the}} original and uses the complex belt tensioner and steering linkage seen in the 1884 plans, while the Deutsches Museum's replica has the simple handlebar, as well as <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> on the rear wheel.|$|E
2500|$|In {{rear-wheel drive}} {{automobiles}} the central drive shaft (or prop shaft) engages the differential through a hypoid gear(ring and pinion). <b>The</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> {{is mounted on}} the carrier of the planetary chain that forms the differential.

2500|$|Garza {{began working}} for Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA), one of Mexico's largest wrestling promotions, in 2015 where was {{introduced}} under the ring name [...] "Garza Jr.", abandoning the [...] "El Hijo del Ninja" [...] moniker {{from that point}} on. His first AAA match was at Héroes Inmortales IX held on October 4, 2015. He was introduced as [...] "Garza Jr." [...] for the first time, adopting both <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> and mannerisms resembling his uncle Héctor. Garza Jr. teamed up with Psycho Clown and Rey Mysterio Jr. to defeat the trio of Myzteziz, El Texano Jr. and El Hijo del Fantasma in the semi-main event of the show. Garza Jr. teamed up with La Parka and Electroshock {{to compete for the}} vacant AAA World Trios Championship at the 2016 Guerra de Titanes show. The match also was a three way match that included the trio of El Hijo de Pirata Morgan, Hijo del Fantasma and Taurus and the winning trio of Dark Cuervo, Dark Scoria and El Zorro. Garza Jr. failed to qualify for the finals of the 2016 Rey de Reyes tournament as he was eliminated by Blue Demon Jr. In April 2016 Garza Jr. was defeated by El Texano Jr. and thus was not able to qualify for the 2016 Lucha Libre World Cup. Garza Jr. was teamed up with El Hijo del Fantasma for a four-way AAA World Tag Team Championship match at Triplemanía XXIV against champions Los Güeros del Cielo (Angélico and Jack Evans), Drago and Aero Star, Paul London and Matt Cross. In the end Drago and Aero Star won the match and the championship. After several mid-card matches Garza Jr. competed in the main event of Héroes Inmortales X, just over a year after his AAA debut. Garza Jr. unsuccessfully challenged Johnny Mundo for the AAA Latin American Championship in a match that was originally scheduled to be lower on the card but was moved to the main event {{on the night of the}} show. Three months later Garza Jr. was involved in another featured match, this time at the 2017 Guerra de Titanes show, where he fought, and lost to El Hijo del Fantasma in a match where the AAA World Cruiserweight Championship was on the line.|$|E
50|$|Engines with manual {{transmission}} {{usually have a}} heavy flywheel, typically 5 to 10 kg of cast iron, with <b>the</b> starter <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> shrunk onto <b>the</b> outside. This is done by heating <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> to around 200 °C to expand <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> which is then placed onto the flywheel, often held in firmly against a location shoulder until cool. The interference fit renders <b>the</b> starter <b>ring</b> firmly attached to the flywheel.

40|$|A {{planetary}} gear system includes a sun gear coupled to an annular <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> through a plurality of twist-planet gears, a speeder gear, and a ground structure having an internal <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Each planet gear includes a solid gear having a first half portion {{in the form of}} a spur gear which includes vertical gear teeth and a second half portion {{in the form of a}} spur gear which includes helical gear teeth that are offset from the vertical gear teeth and which contact helical gear teeth on the speeder gear and helical gear teeth on <b>the</b> outer <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> One half of the twist planet gears are preloaded downward, while the other half are preloaded upwards, each one alternating with the other so that each one twists in a motion opposite to its neighbor when rotated until each planet gear seats against the sun <b>gear,</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>ring</b> <b>gear,</b> <b>the</b> speeder <b>gear,</b> and <b>the</b> inner <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> <b>The</b> resulting configuration is an improved stiff anti-backlash gear system...|$|R
40|$|To {{compensate}} for the poor quality of thick-plate blanking parts in cross-section, this paper suggests using <b>the</b> optimizing bilateral <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> holder parameters to increase burnish zone and improve cutting precision. With <b>the</b> bilateral <b>gear</b> <b>ring,</b> <b>the</b> hydrostatic pressure of shear deformation zone will increase, plasticity of the material will be lifted to maximum {{and quality of the}} cross section will be raised.

5000|$|This {{rotation}} of the planet gears can in turn drive <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> (not depicted in diagram), in a corresponding ratio. If <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> has N teeth, then the ring will rotate by N/N turns for each turn of the planet gears. For instance, if <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> has 64 teeth, and the planets 16, one clockwise turn of a planet gear results in 16/64, or 1/4 clockwise turns of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Extending this case from the one above: ...|$|E
50|$|The Bendix system {{places the}} starter drive pinion on a helical drive spring. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia {{of the drive}} pinion {{assembly}} causes it to wind the spring forcing {{the length of the}} spring to change and engage with <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> When the engine starts, backdrive from <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back and out of mesh with <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E

50|$|Shutting off {{the engine}} caused the {{transmission}} oil pressure to rapidly dissipate. If the selector lever was in reverse or moved to reverse after the engine stopped, two mechanical parts combined to provide a parking brake. <b>The</b> reverse unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> was held stationary by the reverse anchor. The drive shaft could still turn causing the reverse unit sun gear and attached rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> to rotate {{at a very high}} speed, {{were it not for the}} fact that <b>the</b> rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> band was now applied by a heavy spring. Usually, bands are applied by a servo and released by spring pressure, but in this case, the band was held off by the servo and applied by spring pressure (actually, when the engine was running, the band was applied by a combination of spring pressure assisted by oil pressure). With the engine off, this brake band acting on <b>the</b> rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> had a tremendous mechanical advantage. Since <b>the</b> rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> with its attached reverse unit sun gear and <b>the</b> reverse unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> were both locked to the transmission case, the planet carriers and driveshaft could not turn. As such, it provided an effective driveshaft mounted parking brake to be used alone or supplementing the hand brake.|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{actuating mechanism}} was provided for a {{gas turbine engine}} incorporating fan blades of the variable pitch variety, the actuator adapted to rotate the individual fan blades within apertures in an associated fan disc. The actuator included means such {{as a pair of}} synchronizing <b>ring</b> <b>gears,</b> one {{on each side of the}} blade shanks, and adapted to engage pinions disposed thereon. Means were provided to impart rotation to <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gears</b> in opposite directions to effect rotation of the blade shanks in response to a predetermined input signal. In the event of system failure, a run-away actuator was prevented by an improved braking device which arrests the mechanism...|$|R
50|$|To measure road-race courses, {{the counter}} is fitted to a bicycle between the left fork leg {{and the front}} wheel. The tab or tabs on <b>the</b> large <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> engage with <b>the</b> spokes, thus {{providing}} drive to a Veeder-Root counter.|$|R
50|$|This overrunning-clutch pinion {{arrangement}} was phased into use {{beginning in the}} early 1960s; before that time, a Bendix drive was used. The Bendix system places the starter drive pinion on a helically cut drive shaft. When the starter motor begins turning, the inertia of the drive pinion assembly causes it to ride forward on the helix and thus engage with <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> When the engine starts, backdrive from <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> causes the drive pinion to exceed the rotative speed of the starter, at which point the drive pinion is forced back down the helical shaft and thus out of mesh with <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
50|$|Epicyclic gearing is also {{available}} which consists of a sun, a carrier, and two planets which mesh with each other. One planet meshes with the sun gear, while the second planet meshes with <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> For this case, when the carrier is fixed, <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> rotates {{in the same direction}} as the sun gear, thus providing a reversal in direction compared to standard epicyclic gearing.|$|E
50|$|All modern {{starters}} {{rely on the}} solenoid {{to engage}} the starter drive with <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> of the flywheel. When the solenoid is energized, it operates a plunger or lever which forces the pinion into mesh with <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> The pinion incorporates a one way clutch {{so that when the}} engine starts and runs it will not attempt to drive the starter motor at excessive RPM.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{tests were}} {{performed}} on the NASA/Bell Helicopter Textron (BHT) 500 hp advanced technology transmission (ATT) at the NASA Lewis Research Center. The ATT was a retrofit of the OH- 58 C helicopter 236 kW (317 hp) main rotor transmission, upgraded to 373 kW (500 hp), with a design goal of retaining long life with a minimum increase in cost, weight, and size. Vibration, strain, efficiency, deflection, and temperature experiments were performed {{and the results were}} compared to previous experiments on the OH- 58 A, OH- 58 C, and UH- 60 A transmissions. The high-contact-ratio gears and <b>the</b> cantilevered-mounted, flexible <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> of <b>the</b> ATT reduced vibration compared to that of the OH- 58 C. <b>The</b> ATT flexible <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> improved planetary load sharing compared to that of <b>the</b> rigid <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> of <b>the</b> UH- 60 A transmission. The ATT mechanical efficiency was lower than that of the OH- 58 A transmission, probably due to the high-contact-ratio planetary gears...|$|R
50|$|From 1939-1950, {{the reverse}} anchor {{was used to}} lock <b>the</b> reverse unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> from turning by {{engaging}} external teeth machined into that <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> From 1951 on, a cone clutch {{did the same thing}} when oil pressure was up, and a spring-loaded parking pawl was allowed to lock <b>the</b> same <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> in <b>the</b> absence of oil pressure. This worked better as the anchor would not grind on the external teeth if that <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> were turning (that is, unless the engine stalled as reverse was engaged). Reverse was obtained by applying torque from the front unit (band on, in reduction) through the fluid coupling to the rear unit sun gear. The planet carrier of this gearset was splined to the planet carrier of the reverse unit. <b>The</b> rear unit <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> hub had a small gear machined on its end which served as the reverse unit sun gear. Because the rear unit band was not applied for reverse, the rear unit and reverse unit compounded causing the combined planet carriers to rotate opposite to the input torque and at a further reduced speed. The output shaft was machined onto the rear unit and reverse unit planet carriers.|$|R
50|$|With various configurations, Hydraulic {{starters}} can {{be fitted}} on any engine.

50|$|The {{rotation}} of <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> {{is always the}} average of the rotations of the side sun gears. This is why if the driven roadwheels are lifted clear of the ground with the engine off, and the drive shaft is held (say, leaving the transmission in gear preventing <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> from turning inside the differential), manually rotating one driven roadwheel causes the opposite roadwheel to rotate in the opposite direction by the same amount.|$|E

30|$|In the previous work [1], {{the elastic}} mesh-phasing {{vibrations}} of spur planetary ring gears were {{addressed by the}} superposition method, which was motivated by the ultrasonic motors [50] and PGT [25], but only in-plane bending and extensional deformations were incorporated. Practically, whatever the deformations are, the various free vibrations are of elastic waves definitely with periodicity due to <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear’s</b> closed shape. Since the vibrations at different mesh positions are identical except for a phase lag, the resulting vibration can be obtained via a simple superposition either for bending or extensional deformation. The same can be true for the helical planetary ring gears.|$|R
50|$|More {{planet and}} sun gear units {{can be placed}} in series in <b>the</b> same <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> housing (where <b>the</b> output shaft of the first stage becomes the input shaft of the next stage) {{providing}} a larger (or smaller) gear ratio.
