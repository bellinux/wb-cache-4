[...] The definition of [...] "eligible contract participant" [...] covered the same types of [...] "sophisticated" [...] parties as the existing [...] "swaps exemption" [...] in its definition of [...] "eligible swap participants", but was broader, particularly by adding permission for individuals with assets of $5 million rather than $10 million, if the <b>transaction</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> managing <b>asset</b> or liability [...] "risk." [...] The PWG had recommended [...] "considering" [...] an increase in this threshold to $25 million, not a reduction for actual hedging.|$|R

In modern accounting software or ERP, the general ledger {{works as a}} central repository for accounting data transferred from all subledgers or modules like accounts payable, accounts receivable, cash management, fixed assets, purchasing and projects.

40|$|Asset {{securitization}} via {{special purpose}} entities involves {{the process of}} transforming assets into securities that are issued to investors. These investors hold the rights to payments supported by the cash flows from an asset pool held by the said entity. In this paper, we discuss the mechanism by which low- and high-quality entities securitize low- and high-quality assets, respectively, into collateralized debt obligations. During the 2007 – 2009 financial crisis, asset securitization was seriously inhibited. In response to this, for instance, new Basel III capital and liquidity regulations were introduced. Here, we find that we can explicitly determine the <b>transaction</b> costs <b>related</b> <b>to</b> low-quality <b>asset</b> securitization. Also, {{in the case of}} dynamic and static multipliers, the effects of unexpected negative shocks such as rating downgrades on asset price and input, debt obligation price and output, and profit will be quantified. In this case, we note that Basel III has been designed to provide countercyclical capital buffers to negate procyclicality. Moreover, we will develop an illustrative example of low-quality asset securitization for subprime mortgages. Furthermore, numerical examples to illustrate the key results will be provided. In addition, connections between Basel III and asset securitization will be highlighted...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by {{the former}} {{researchers}} who focus only {{on one of the}} factor <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible investments, this study analyzes factors <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible investments. This study investigates wether cash, equity, expense and income are <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible investments. The reasons why the issue becomes a crucial matter are: First, recent accounting and finance literature say that intangible assets are a firm value creator and increasingly becoming the major drivers of firm value and performance. Second, current financial statements provide very little information about these assets. Even worse, much of the information that is provided is partial, inconsistent, and confusing. Third, intangible assets empirical studies in Indonesia are still very limited. Using sample from manufacture firms listed at the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) over 2003 - 2007, the result indicates that generally cash, equity, expense and income are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets.</b> These findings have twelve main concerns: First, unexpected cash are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> but statistically insignificant. Second, the increasing unexpected cash are negatively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> and statistically insignificant. Third, the decreasing unexpected cash are negatively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> and statistically insignificant. Fourth, unexpected equity are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> and statistically significant. Fifth, the increasing unexpected equity are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> and statistically significant. Sixth, the decreasing unexpected equity are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> but statistically insignificant. Seventh, unexpected expense are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> and statistically significant. Eighth, the increasing unexpected expense are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> and statistically significant. Ninth, the decreasing unexpected expense are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> but statistically insignificant. Tenth, unexpected income are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> but statistically insignificant. Eleventh, the increasing unexpected income are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> and statistically significant. Twelfth, the decreasing unexpected income are positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> intangible <b>assets</b> but statistically insignificant...|$|R
