5|$|DDT {{was banned}} in the US in 1972, after the {{discussion}} opened in 1962 by Silent Spring, written by American biologist Rachel Carson, which launched <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> in the West. The book catalogued {{the environmental impacts of}} indiscriminate DDT spraying and suggested that DDT and other pesticides cause cancer and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife. The U.S. Agency for International Development supports indoor DDT spraying as a vital component of malaria control programs and has initiated DDT and other insecticide spraying programs in tropical countries.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, marine {{biologist}} and ecologist Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring helped to mobilize <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> by alerting {{the public to}} toxic pesticides, such as DDT, bioaccumulating in the environment. Carson used ecological science to link the release of environmental toxins to human and ecosystem health. Since then, ecologists have worked to bridge {{their understanding of the}} degradation of the planet's ecosystems with environmental politics, law, restoration, and natural resources management.|$|E
40|$|The protests at Warren County, North Carolina, in {{the early}} 1980 s led to several critical, {{galvanizing}} events {{in the history of}} <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> justice <b>movement.</b> This article suggests that <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> justice <b>movement</b> — while often characterized as a marriage between <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> and civil rights movements — has adopted key facets of both movements. The 1990 letter to the so-called “Big 10 ” marked an evolutionary point that has led <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> justice <b>movement</b> to establish valuable alliances with some mainstream <b>environmental</b> groups. Additionally, <b>the</b> article suggests from a jurisprudential perspective that civil rights laws in that same period failed <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> justice <b>movement,</b> thereby challenging <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> justice <b>movement’s</b> ties to the civil rights movement. This piece first discusses <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> justice <b>movement’s</b> initial symbiotic relationship with the civil rights movement. It then touches on the history of <b>the</b> mainstream <b>environmental</b> <b>movement,</b> highlighting how racist and classist principles guided the early development of that movement. Finally, it considers how <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> justice <b>movement</b> evolved in light of those relationships to civil rights and <b>the</b> mainstream <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> and suggests how environmental justice might intersect with those movements in the future...|$|R

Through a collective memory and discourse framework, this study reviews the overlap and disparity in perceptions of <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> in <b>the</b> Soviet Union and Russia. The portrait {{that emerges from}} the analysis of <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> suggests that <b>the</b> impact of <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> in Russia may be limited {{in part because it}} has developed in contravention to existing discourses. More importantly, the context and underlying assumptions of <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> are not formulated in ways that are compatible with existing collective identities in Russian society...|$|R
5|$|The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement {{was founded}} by Les U. Knight, a high school {{substitute}} teacher who lives in Portland, Oregon. After becoming involved in <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> {{as a college student}} in the 1970s, Knight attributed most of the dangers faced by the planet to human overpopulation. He joined the Zero Population Growth organization, and chose to be vasectomised at age 25. He later concluded that the extinction of humanity would be the best solution to the Earth's environmental problems. He believes that this idea has also been held by some people throughout human history.|$|E
5|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding the Rampart Dam project illustrated the growing shift in <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> during the 1960s. Rather than becoming focused singularly on solely preserving {{the natural beauty}} of a particular landscape, as had inspired the creation of the U.S. National Park Service in the United States {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, naturalists and environmentalists began to consider the human cost of development as well. Though opposition to Rampart was founded primarily on economic and natural grounds, it consequences for the Alaska Native population in the region reflected later concerns about industrial development in more urban areas.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> in the American Southwest {{has opposed}} the damming and {{diversion}} of the Colorado River system because of detrimental {{effects on the}} ecology and natural beauty of the river and its tributaries. During the construction of Glen Canyon Dam, environmental organizations vowed to block any further development of the river, and a number of later dam and aqueduct proposals were defeated by citizen opposition. As demands for Colorado River water continue to rise, the level of human development and control of the river continues to generate controversy.|$|E

The film grossed $24 million in the U.S. and $26 million at the international box office, becoming the tenth highest grossing documentary film to date in the United States. Since the film's release, An Inconvenient Truth has been credited for raising international public awareness of global warming and reenergizing <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>movement.</b> The documentary has also been included in science curricula in schools around the world, which has spurred some controversy.

5|$|VHEMT {{was founded}} in 1991 by Les U. Knight, an American activist who became {{involved}} in <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> in the 1970s and thereafter concluded that human extinction was the best solution to the problems facing the Earth's biosphere and humanity. Knight publishes the group's newsletter and serves as its spokesman. Although the group is promoted by a website and represented at some environmental events, it relies heavily on coverage from outside media to spread its message. Many commentators view its platform as unacceptably extreme, though other writers have applauded VHEMT's perspective. In response to VHEMT, some journalists and academics have argued that humans can develop sustainable lifestyles or can reduce their population to sustainable levels. Others maintain that, whatever {{the merits of the}} idea, the human reproductive drive will prevent humankind from ever voluntarily seeking extinction.|$|E
5|$|In March 1959, Tulare County {{approved}} {{a change in}} location of the proposed highway to Olancha Pass (Haiwee Pass, just to the south, was soon considered for a possible alternate location), and the legislature moved the main line of Route 127 south to that location, crossing US 395 at Olancha, later that year. The old route from southeast of Keeler to Lone Pine remained as a branch, and was still signed as SR 190. Also in 1959, the original routing from Lone Pine through Death Valley to Baker {{was added to the}} proposed California Freeway and Expressway System, though no parts have been upgraded as such. The eastwest piece between Tipton and Death Valley Junction legislatively received the State Route 190 designation in the 1964 renumbering, and the north–south part became State Route 127, as it had been signed; the branch to Lone Pine became a new State Route 136. By the mid-1970s, <b>the</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> had essentially killed the planned connection, and the designation of the Golden Trout Wilderness in 1978 and South Sierra Wilderness in 1984 were the final blow, though Caltrans still has an officially adopted alignment designated over Haiwee Pass.|$|E
