If the blip was slightly longer on the right than left side of the azimuth display, for instance, he would instruct the pilot to turn right in an effort <b>to</b> <b>centre</b> the target. Interceptions normally resulted in a stream of left/right and up/down corrections while reading out the (hopefully) decreasing range.|$|E

His next international appearance, under the captaincy of his Newport teammate Tommy Vile, was on 18 January 1913 against England. Wales were beaten in Cardiff 0–12. After the game, and {{disappointed by the}} performance {{of most of the}} team, the selectors made nine changes for the upcoming match against Scotland. Only two backs were to be retained, Bobby Williams, the fullback, and Billy Geen, deemed the outstanding threequarter against England, moving from wing <b>to</b> <b>centre.</b> However, on the Wednesday preceding the encounter in Edinburgh, Geen withdrew after a training session due to an ongoing shoulder injury, and his place on the team was taken by Willie Watts.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} 15 years, {{numerous}} asylum seeker centres (ASCs) {{have been founded}} in the Netherlands, often preceded and followed by neighbourhood unrest. In this contribution we show to what extent people object to the foundation of ASCs of different sizes. We set out {{to answer the question}} of which individual and contextual characteristics contribute to explaining objections to ASCs of different sizes. We use a large-scale survey of a representative sample of the Dutch population. To these individual level data we added contextual information related to the postal code and the municipality respondents live in. We find that objection <b>to</b> large <b>centres</b> is far more widespread than objection <b>to</b> small <b>centres.</b> Lower educated people object more strongly <b>to</b> <b>centres,</b> whatever the size. People with high incomes tend to object <b>to</b> large <b>centres</b> more strongly than people with low incomes. At the contextual level we find that in neighbourhoods with high values for real estate, people object more strongly <b>to</b> small <b>centres.</b> Municipalities with high percentages of low income populations object <b>to</b> small <b>centres</b> more strongly. The percentage of ethnic minorities at the postal code or municipality level is not related <b>to</b> objection <b>to</b> <b>centres,</b> whereas the actual presence of an ASC in the neighbourhood decreases objections. ...|$|R
5|$|In 1898, {{he moved}} to Second Division Grimsby Town. Though now playing in the {{professional}} Football League, Chapman was still an amateur at this stage and obtained {{a job with a}} firm of local solicitors to earn his way. Grimsby started the season poorly – they were {{near the bottom of the}} division by Christmas and were beaten 7–0 by Preston North End in the FA Cup, but rallied to finish tenth at the end of the 1898–99 season. By this time Chapman had been dropped from the team, having been unsuccessfully moved <b>to</b> <b>centre</b> forward, an unfamiliar position for him. He was released by Grimsby and drifted down into non-league football with a brief spell at Swindon Town, playing three games and scoring twice, but had to leave the club as he was unable to find a job in the area. He moved on to see out the season with Sheppey United, who finished bottom of the Southern League in 1899–1900. Chapman finished as United's top scorer but was injured at the end of this season, and still unable to find a job. Disheartened, he returned to his home town and turned out for Worksop Town of the Midland League in 1900–01, while resuming his studies, this time at Old Firth College in Sheffield.|$|E
5|$|Pennsylvania Route 263 (PA 263) is a northsouth {{state highway}} located in {{southeast}} Pennsylvania. The southern terminus {{of the route}} is at PA 611 in Willow Grove, Montgomery County. The northern terminus is at the Centre Bridge-Stockton Bridge over the Delaware River in Centre Bridge, Bucks County, where it continues into Stockton, New Jersey as Bridge Street to an intersection with Route 29. It follows the routing of Old York Road, a historic road that connected Philadelphia to New York City, and carries the name York Road from the southern terminus to Lahaska and Upper York Road north of there. From Willow Grove to Buckingham, PA 263 runs mostly through suburban areas as a four-lane road, passing through Hatboro, Warminster, and Jamison. The route forms a concurrency with U.S. Route 202 (US 202) and narrows to a two-lane road, splitting with that route in Lahaska. From here, the route continues through rural areas <b>to</b> <b>Centre</b> Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{possible}} elements is not known. A very early suggestion made by Elliot Adams in 1911, {{and based on the}} arrangement of elements in each horizontal periodic table row, was that elements of atomic weight greater than 256± (which would equate to between elements 99 and 100 in modern-day terms) did not exist. A higher—more recent—estimate is that the periodic table may end soon after the island of stability, which is expected <b>to</b> <b>centre</b> around element 126, as the extension of the periodic and nuclides tables is restricted by proton and neutron drip lines. Other predictions of an end to the periodic table include at element 128 by John Emsley, at element 137 by Richard Feynman, and at element 155 by Albert Khazan.|$|E

5|$|The west door, {{actually}} in {{the south side of}} the church, is an elegant ornamented Decorated Gothic pointed arch, traditionally said to have come from Strata Florida Abbey. Whether it actually came from the Abbey is uncertain. A more probable date is thirteenth century, given its syle. Strata Florida Abbey was founded in 1164 and was consecrated in 1201. The arch is exceptionally ornate, indeed the finest such work in the county. It has three deeply moulded shafts each triple-roll with keel <b>to</b> <b>centre</b> roll and stiff-leaf capitals and matching triple mouldings to the pointed arch, with hoodmould.
