5|$|Early {{research}} {{on the role of}} antioxidants in biology focused on their use in preventing the oxidation of unsaturated fats, which is the cause of rancidity. Antioxidant activity could be measured simply by placing the fat in a closed container with oxygen and measuring the rate of oxygen consumption. However, it was <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> vitamins A, C, and E as antioxidants that revolutionized the field and led to the realization of the importance of antioxidants in the biochemistry of living organisms. The possible mechanisms of action of antioxidants were first explored when it was recognized that a substance with anti-oxidative activity is likely to be one that is itself readily oxidized. Research into how vitamin E prevents the process of lipid peroxidation led to <b>the</b> <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> antioxidants as reducing agents that prevent oxidative reactions, often by scavenging reactive oxygen species before they can damage cells.|$|E

But {{it is difficult to}} reflect user's thought direct on operation at this stage. In order to realize it, we need to identify a kind of human's brain signal when human thinks about moving object. So our study verifies whether it is possible to identify by imaging direction in data that we investigate cerebral blood flow changes in using NIRS when subject thinks about moving object. Identification was using neural network. <b>The</b> average <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> ratio <b>of</b> 4 direction in Total-Hb, <b>the</b> average <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> ratio <b>of</b> 4 direction in Oxy-Hb, <b>the</b> average <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> ratio <b>of</b> 4 direction in Deoxy-Hb are 32. 25 %, 36. 0 % and 37. 0 %, respectively. <b>The</b> average <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> ratio <b>of</b> 2 direction, up and down, in Total-Hb, <b>the</b> average <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> ratio <b>of</b> 2 direction, up and down, in Oxy-Hb, <b>the</b> average <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> ratio <b>of</b> 2 direction, up and down, in Deoxy-Hb are 63. 5 %, 62. 0 % and 62. 5 %, respectively. <b>The</b> average <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> ratio <b>of</b> 2 direction, left and right, in Total-Hb, <b>the</b> average <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> ratio <b>of</b> 2 direction, left and right, in Oxy-Hb, <b>the</b> average <b>of</b> <b>identification</b> ratio <b>of</b> 2 direction, left and right, in Deoxy-Hb are 58. 0 %, 55. 5 % and 69. 0 %, respectively.

5|$|Of noble birth, Cuthbert {{is first}} {{recorded}} as the Abbot of Lyminge, {{from where he}} was elevated to the See of Hereford in 736. <b>The</b> <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the Cuthbert who was Bishop of Hereford with the Cuthbert who became archbishop, however, comes from Florence of Worcester and other post-Conquest sources. The contemporary record in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle says that Cuthbert was consecrated archbishop, where if he had been Bishop of Hereford, he would have been translated.
