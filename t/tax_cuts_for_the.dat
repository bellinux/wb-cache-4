5|$|In {{the first}} ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount {{garnered}} the most votes; Cravins {{was defeated by}} less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a second ballot was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favoring <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rich and being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents. Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases. Mount criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of social security, an unpopular position in Louisiana, and as distant from the interests of individual voters. She received endorsements from U.S. Senator John Breaux, who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and Governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles. Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss. Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
25|$|Obama {{increased}} {{taxes on}} high-income taxpayers via: a) expiration of the Bush income <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> top 1–2% of income earners starting with 2013; and b) payroll tax increases on roughly the top 5% of earners {{as part of}} the ACA. This increased the average tax rate paid by the top 1% (incomes above $443,000 in 2015) from 28% in 2012 to 34% in 2013. According to the CBO, after-tax income inequality improved, by lowering the share of after-tax income received by the top 1% from 16.7% in 2007 to 15.1% in 2012 and to 12.4% in 2013.|$|E

[...] On October 21, The New York Times endorsed Maloney, stating that his opponent [...] "has favored limiting contraception coverage for employees and voted to defund Planned Parenthood.

500|$|Obama {{initially}} viewed Ryan as a Republican {{who could}} help cut the federal deficit. In January 2010, at the House Republican annual retreat, Obama called Ryan's budget proposal a [...] "serious proposal" [...] finding both points of agreement and disagreement, saying [...] "some ideas in there ... that I would agree with, {{but there are some}} ideas that we should have a healthy debate about because I don't agree with them". Chief Actuary of Medicare Rick Foster compared Ryan's [...] "Roadmap" [...] with the 2010 healthcare reform in congressional hearings, stating that while both had [...] "some potential" [...] to make healthcare prices [...] "more sustainable," [...] he was more [...] "confident" [...] in Ryan's plan. Economist and columnist Paul Krugman criticized Ryan's plan as making overly optimistic assumptions and proposing <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wealthy. Krugman also called the plan a [...] "fraud" [...] saying it relied on severe cuts in domestic discretionary spending and [...] "dismantling Medicare as we know it" [...] by suggesting the voucher system, which he noted was similar to a failed attempt at reform in 1995. In contrast, columnist Ramesh Ponnuru, writing in the National Review, argued that Ryan's plan would lead to less debt than current budgets. Economist Ted Gayer wrote that [...] "Ryan's vision of broad-based tax reform, which essentially would shift us toward a consumption tax ... makes a useful contribution to this debate." ...|$|E

Using a simple model of occupational choice, I show how both factors can cause efficiency losses in a free market economy, and how linear differential occupational taxation can improve on the market outcome. A simulation exercise calibrated with UK data advocates a tax premium on employment incomes and a <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> self-employed, in order to generate an efficiency gain of around one third of one per cent of GDP...|$|R
50|$|The {{third party}} candidates' tax plans were not studied by {{mainstream}} media outlets and the Tax Policy Center. Chuck Baldwin supports replacing {{the income tax}} with a 10% across-the-board tariff on imported goods. Bob Barr supports replacing the income tax with a consumption tax (the FairTax). The details of his exact plan are not known but consumption taxes tend to be regressive unless accompanied by a negative income tax <b>for</b> <b>the</b> poor to offset necessary expenditures. Cynthia McKinney supports sharply progressive taxation, with higher taxes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rich and a <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> middle class.|$|R
500|$|Titled {{after the}} [...] "drinking the Kool-Aid" [...] metaphor, [...] "Kool-Aid" [...] has a dark {{electric}} blues style, noir musical vibes, and lyrics about the politically misguided {{lower middle class}} who support Republican <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rich. The song's narrative follows a young American who accepts the Bush administration's pro-war stance, heads off to a foreign land willing to fight any person of color, and returns to his home jobless. According to writer James C. McKinley, Jr., the song continues a theme Cooder established on Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down: [...] "the idea of poor whites who have been let down by the politicians they have supported." [...] It also paraphrases the lyrics to the Western swing standard [...] "Cocaine Blues", and touches on the controversial stand-your-ground law, which Cooder viewed as [...] "new Jim Crow laws – the stand-your-ground law is already responsible for about 80 shooting deaths of African Americans." [...] "The 90 and the 9" [...] repurposes the gospel hymn {{of the same name}} and the worker songs of Joe Hill with apocalyptic themes, an anti-war narrative, and a depiction of modern union workers as part of the lower 99% of income distribution in the US. Cooder was inspired to write the song by military recruitment of high schoolers in his native Los Angeles. [...] "Take Your Hands off It" [...] has a defiant tone, prominent guitar, and lyrics that rousingly defend constitutional rights.|$|E

2500|$|The {{economic}} success seen under Reagan was politically accomplished (principally) in two ways. The first was initiation of deep <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> wealthy, {{and the second}} was a wide-spectrum of tax cuts for crude oil production and refinement, namely, with the 1980 Windfall profits tax cuts. These policies were augmented with a call for heightened military spending, the cutting of social welfare programs for the poor, and the increasing of taxes on those making less than $50,000 per year. Collectively called [...] "Reaganomics", these economic policies were established through several pieces of legislation passed between 1980 and 1987.|$|E

[...] "John McCain seems determined {{to carry out a}} third Bush term", Obama said.

[...] In 2001 the DLC endorsed the idea of <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> middle class, but opposed the Bush tax cut since it favored the wealthy and was perceived by the DLC as fiscally irresponsible.

There was also rumor that Carp, the opponent of centralism, had designed a project to replace the Prefectures with so-called Căpitănii ("Captaincies"). Although such measures were not effected, the new administration was successful in tackling other issues: both deficit {{and the cost of}} living dropped while the bank reserves trebled, and some palliatives were introduced in lieu of a land reform (the promised tax cuts, plus the freeing of mainmorte property). These policies angered the opposition Conservative-Democrats, who complained that Carp had [...] "monkeyed" [...] their own reform program. By January 1912, they joined up with the PNL in organizing mass demonstrations, calling for an immediate transfer of power, and alleging that a mass repression was being organized against them by government troops—claims met with sarcasm by Conservative newspapers such as Epoca.|$|E
