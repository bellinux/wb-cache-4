Banks closer to the regulatory limit {{are less likely to}} finance their growth based only on debt issuances compared with banks with a capital buffer over the minimum because this financing would deteriorate their capital ratio even more. In this case, we expect that the coefficient of this variable will be negative for <b>the</b> <b>issuances</b> of debt and/or positive for <b>the</b> <b>issuances</b> of instruments considered regulatory capital.

30|$|Besides {{the effect}} on the pure {{decision}} of issuing versus not issuing, we analyze which instruments banks choose to respond to liquidity needs. If the decision on the instrument follows the pecking order, banks would only issue debt instruments to minimize the cost of asymmetric information and, therefore, the liquidity and growth variables would only be significant for debt <b>issuances.</b> If <b>the</b> decision on the instruments follows the trade-off theory, we should observe significant coefficients in all financial instruments because the banks have to combine <b>the</b> <b>issuances</b> of all types of financial instruments to maintain the same proportion of each component. This result could be consistent with the fulfillment of capital regulation, if banks issue both hybrid and capital instruments to keep their regulatory capital levels constant.
