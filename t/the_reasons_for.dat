5|$|<b>The</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> this drastic {{population}} reduction {{are thought}} to be due to agricultural improvements, abandonment of extensive management, and deforestation.

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} {{indirect}} evidence is often available {{to assist in}} understanding the timing of a vertical merger or divestiture. In particular, it is shown that in cases involving firm-specific capital, changes in the residual correlation (after removing market and industry effects) between the firms' stock returns are helpful in explaining <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> and <b>the</b> timing of the merger/divestiture. The ramifications of this finding are immediate since anything that can pinpoint <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> a merger, and, moreover, <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> timing of a merger, will make merger policy more efficient and productive.
