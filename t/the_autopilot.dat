5|$|<b>The</b> <b>autopilot</b> {{had been}} used since 25 seconds after {{take-off}} from Namsos and {{was used for the}} remainder of the flight. From 20:29:21 all four engines showed increasing torque and immediately before the crash the aircraft had shifted its angle from −2.5degrees to 5degrees. At 20:29:29 the ground proximity warning system showed 'minimum'. The aircraft crashed into the western side Torghatten at 20:29:30 at 170meters (560ft) elevation.|$|E

The real Alice boarded beforehand and attempts to execute Wesker, only for him to injects her with an Anti-Virus to remove her superhuman abilities. Wesker is revealed to have used the T-Virus to gain his own superhuman abilities and prepares to kill Alice, before <b>the</b> <b>autopilot</b> crashes the plane into the mountains and only Alice survives.|$|E
5|$|The Collins-class {{submarines}} {{experienced a}} wide range of problems during their construction and early service life. Many of these were attributed to the submarines being a new, untested design, and were successfully addressed as they were discovered. Most systems and features worked with few or no problems, while the boats' maximum speed, manoeuvrability, and low-speed submerged endurance were found to exceed specifications. The ship control system, which during development had been marked as a major potential problem, functioned beyond positive expectation: for example, <b>the</b> <b>autopilot</b> (which aboard Collins was nicknamed 'Sven') was found to be better at maintaining depth during snorting than most helmsmen.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>autopilot</b> {{system used}} at the time had four basic control modes: HEADING, VOR/LOC, ILS, and INS. The HEADING mode {{maintained}} a constant magnetic course selected by the pilot. The VOR/LOC mode maintained the plane on a specific course, transmitted from a VOR (VHF omnidirectional range, a type of short-range radio signal transmitted from ground beacons) or Localizer (LOC) beacon selected by the pilot. The ILS (instrument landing system) mode caused the plane to track both vertical and lateral course beacons, {{which led to a}} specific runway selected by the pilot. The INS (inertial navigation system) mode maintained the plane on lateral course lines between selected flight plan waypoints programmed into the INS computer.|$|E

Aircraft bank angle {{is used to}} maintain desired closing speeds along and normal to the desired track. The algorithm is capable of tracking linear and circular path segments. Simulated flights under near gale force winds suggest the algorithm is sufficiently robust for practical navigation during off-shore research. The algorithm's simplicity permits a high frequency update by <b>the</b> <b>autopilot's</b> low-power processor...|$|R
50|$|The {{system was}} later {{upgraded}} to relay directional information directly to <b>the</b> <b>autopilots</b> of <b>the</b> interceptor aircraft like the F-106 Delta Dart. The pilot was tasked primarily with getting the aircraft {{into the air}} (and back), and then flying in a parking orbit until called for. When an interception mission started, the SAGE computers automatically flew the plane into range of the target, allowing the pilot to concentrate solely on operating the complex onboard radar.|$|R
50|$|The L-1011 {{featured}} a highly advanced autopilot system {{and was the}} first widebody to receive FAA certification for Cat-IIIc autolanding, which approved the TriStar for completely blind landings in zero-visibility weather performed by <b>the</b> aircraft's <b>autopilot.</b> <b>The</b> L-1011 used an inertial navigation system to navigate; this included aligning the navigation system by entering current coordinates of longitude and latitude.|$|R
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{has three}} autopilot modes. The standard mode for en-route navigation is LNAV, which navigates along a {{great circle route}} between waypoints, adjusting the aircraft's heading to compensate for wind. Other modes will maintain the aircraft's heading—direction the nose is pointed (flight path {{will be affected by}} winds)—or the aircraft's track—direction the aircraft travels (flight path in a straight direction). The latter two modes are further affected by whether the aircraft used magnetic (normal reference) or true north (typically only used at high latitudes) as the reference for <b>the</b> <b>autopilot.</b> Since Flight 370 flew near waypoints VAMPI, MEKAR, NILAM, and possibly IGOGU—all along air route N571—while traversing the Malacca Strait, investigators considered whether Flight 370 followed any air routes or intersected any waypoints in the Southern Indian Ocean. Waypoints MUTMI and RUNUT were considered possible points that Flight 370 may have traversed, but tracks through these waypoints did not correlate well with paths generated from the BTO and BFO analysis.|$|E

25|$|Chief {{among these}} {{differences}} was {{a conclusion that}} the pilots were not placed under pressure forcing them to land at Smolensk, and furthermore the crew {{did not want to}} land and after reaching 100m altitude (measured by radio altimeter) and had decided to go around using <b>the</b> <b>autopilot.</b> However, it was impossible for <b>the</b> <b>autopilot</b> installed in the aircraft to conduct an automatic go-around from a non-precision approach. The Polish investigation concluded this caused a delay in executing the go-around which contributed to the crash.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> Platform Precision <b>Autopilot</b> is an {{instrument}} landing system interfaced autopilot system, developed to enable an aircraft to repeatedly fly nearly the same trajectory hours, days, or weeks later. <b>The</b> Platform Precision <b>Autopilot</b> uses a novel design to interface with a NASA Gulfstream III jet by imitating the output of {{an instrument}} landing system approach. This technique minimizes, as much as possible, modifications to the baseline Gulfstream III jet and retains the safety features of <b>the</b> aircraft <b>autopilot.</b> <b>The</b> Platform Precision <b>Autopilot</b> requirement is to fly within a 5 -m (16. 4 -ft) radius tube for distances to 200 km (108 nmi) {{in the presence of}} light turbulence for at least 90 percent of the time. This capability allows precise repeat-pass interferometry for the Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar program, whose primary objective is to develop a miniaturized, polarimetric, L-band synthetic aperture radar. Precise navigation is achieved using an accurate differential global positioning system developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Flight-testing has demonstrated the ability of <b>the</b> Platform Precision <b>Autopilot</b> to control <b>the</b> aircraft within the specified tolerance greater than 90 percent of the time in the presence of aircraft system noise and nonlinearities, constant pilot throttle adjustments, and light turbulence...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, updated pilot/display/aircraft {{analysis}} {{techniques are}} applied {{to the problem of}} turbulence upset.

40|$|The {{automatic}} terminal approach system (ATAS) is {{a concept}} for improving the pilot/machine interface with cockpit automation. The ATAS can automatically fly a published instrument approach by using stored instrument approach data to automatically tune airplane avionics, control <b>the</b> airplane's <b>autopilot,</b> and display status information to the pilot. A piloted simulation {{study was conducted to}} determine the feasibility of an ATAS, determine pilot acceptance, and examine pilot/ATAS interaction. Seven instrument-rated pilots each flew four instrument approaches with a base-line heading select <b>autopilot</b> mode. <b>The</b> ATAS runs resulted in lower flight technical error, lower pilot workload, and fewer blunders than with <b>the</b> baseline <b>autopilot.</b> <b>The</b> ATAS status display enabled the pilots to maintain situational awareness during the automatic approaches. The system was well accepted by the pilots...|$|R
25|$|The Agenzia Nazionale per la Sicurezza del Volo (ANSV) {{started an}} inquiry, {{following}} {{the recovery of}} the cockpit voice recorder a week after the crash. The flight data recorder was also recovered, and results from its decoded ribbon showed that the aircraft was flying at cruising altitude with <b>the</b> <b>autopilot</b> engaged, that it got disengaged twelve seconds after <b>the</b> <b>autopilot</b> failure light lit, and that both directional and longitudinal control was lost moments later, with the aircraft crashing 73 seconds after the light came on. The angle and the speed of the impact were estimated to be between 45° and 50° and in the range of , respectively.|$|E
25|$|In flight, the Puma was {{designed}} to be capable of high speeds, exhibit great maneuverability, and have good hot-and-high performance; the engines have an intentionally high level of reserve power to enable a Puma to effectively fly at maximum weight with only one functioning engine and proceed with its mission if circumstances require. The cockpit has conventional dual controls for a pilot and copilot, a third seat is provided in the cockpit for a reserve crew member or commander. The Puma features a SFIM-Newmark Type 127 electro-hydraulic autopilot; <b>the</b> <b>autopilot</b> is capable of roll and pitch stabilization, the load hook operator can also enter corrective adjustments of the helicopter's position from his station through <b>the</b> <b>autopilot.</b>|$|E
25|$|After <b>the</b> <b>autopilot</b> {{had been}} disengaged, the pilot flying {{increased}} engine thrust {{in reaction to}} a decrease in airspeed and a perception that the aircraft was sinking.

50|$|The board {{concluded}} that the 37° turn was executed by the navigator using <b>the</b> <b>autopilot's</b> Doppler navigation mode, which when set maintained the desired heading while making corrections for wind drift. The navigator performed this turn after he saw the VOR signal indicating that the aircraft had intercepted the Maputo VOR 45° radial, the compass direction from Maputo on which the crew intended to turn and approach for a landing on runway 23. However the turn actually put the aircraft on a path following a 45° radial from the VOR beacon at Matsapa Airport, Swaziland.|$|R
