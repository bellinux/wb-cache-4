5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> rider with respect {{to the point where the}} front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E
5|$|If <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> rider are {{considered}} to be a single system, the forces that act on that system and its components can be roughly divided into two groups: internal and external. The external forces are due to gravity, inertia, contact with the ground, and contact with the atmosphere. The internal forces are caused by the rider and by interaction between components.|$|E
5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> the rotation of the wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Helsinki city <b>bike</b> {{system is}} {{procured}} by Helsinki City Transport. The contract {{has been made}} for 10 years for a total value of 12 950 000 euros. <b>The</b> <b>bikes</b> <b>and</b> <b>bike</b> stations are supplied by Smoove, and Moventia is responsible for supplying <b>the</b> stations with <b>bikes</b> at even rates and for the upkeep of <b>the</b> <b>bikes.</b> Clear Channel Finland organizes project promotion and partnerships as a Moventia & Smoove subcontractor. Helsinki Cooperative Society Elanto’s (HOK-Elanto’s) grocery store Alepa is the main cooperation partner of <b>the</b> city <b>bike’s</b> <b>and</b> supports <b>the</b> system’s implementation.|$|R
5|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass does move slightly to the left when the rider leans to the right relative to <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> <b>and</b> the bike leans to the left in response. The action, in space, would have the tires move right, but this is prevented by friction between the tires and the ground, and thus pushes the combined {{center of mass}} left. This is a small effect, however, {{as evidenced by the}} difficulty most people have in balancing a bike by this method alone.|$|E
5|$|The net {{aerodynamic}} drag forces {{may be considered}} to act at a single point, called the center of pressure. At high speeds, this will create a net moment about the rear driving wheel and result in a net transfer of load from the front wheel to the rear wheel. Also, depending on the shape of <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> the shape of any fairing that might be installed, aerodynamic lift may be present that either increases or further reduces the load on the front wheel.|$|E
5|$|Turning {{forces are}} {{generated}} during maneuvers for balancing {{in addition to}} just changing direction of travel. These may be interpreted as centrifugal forces in the accelerating reference frame of <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> rider; or simply as inertia in a stationary, inertial reference frame and not forces at all. Gyroscopic forces acting on rotating parts such as wheels, engine, transmission, etc., are also due to the inertia of those rotating parts. They are discussed further in the section on gyroscopic effects below.|$|E

5|$|Ash pedals furiously toward Viridian City. Ash loses {{control of}} <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> wipes out, {{crashing}} down a hill. Realizing Pikachu's condition is critical, Ash pleads {{him to go}} inside his Poké Ball so that Ash can protect him from the approaching Spearow. Pikachu, after seeing how much Ash cares for it, performs a powerful Thunder attack which drives the Spearow away, but also destroys Misty's bike. As the rain-clouds part, a mysterious golden bird flies over a rainbow and Ash's Pokédex informs him {{that there is no}} current data on this Pokémon and that there are several yet to be identified. Ash carries Pikachu into Viridian City, and Pikachu licks Ash's cheek.|$|E
5|$|If the {{steering}} of a bike is locked, it becomes {{virtually impossible to}} balance while riding. On the other hand, if the gyroscopic effect of rotating bike wheels is cancelled by adding counter-rotating wheels, it is still easy to balance while riding. One other way that a bike can be balanced, with or without locked steering, is by applying appropriate torques between <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> rider {{similar to the way}} a gymnast can swing up from hanging straight down on uneven parallel bars, a person can start swinging on a swing from rest by pumping their legs, or a double inverted pendulum can be controlled with an actuator only at the elbow.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{initiate}} a turn and the necessary lean {{in the direction of}} that turn, a bike must momentarily steer in the opposite direction. This {{is often referred to as}} countersteering. With the front wheel now at a finite angle to the direction of motion, a lateral force is developed at the contact patch of the tire. This force creates a torque around the longitudinal (roll) axis of <b>the</b> <b>bike,</b> <b>and</b> this torque causes the bike to lean away from the initially steered direction and toward the direction of the desired turn. Where there is no external influence, such as an opportune side wind to create the force necessary to lean the bike, countersteering is necessary {{to initiate a}} rapid turn.|$|E

5|$|Internal forces, {{those between}} {{components}} of <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> rider system, are mostly {{caused by the}} rider or by friction. In addition to pedaling, the rider can apply torques between the steering mechanism (front fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) and rear frame, and between the rider and the rear frame. Friction exists between any parts that move against each other: in the drive train, between the steering mechanism and the rear frame, etc. In addition to brakes, which create friction between rotating wheels and non-rotating frame parts, many bikes have front and rear suspensions. Some motorcycles and bicycles have a steering damper to dissipate undesirable kinetic energy, and some bicycles have a spring connecting the front fork to the frame to provide a progressive torque that tends to steer the bicycle straight ahead. On bikes with rear suspensions, feedback between the drive train and the suspension is an issue designers attempt to handle with various linkage configurations and dampers.|$|E

25|$|Most bicycle {{brake systems}} consist of three main {{components:}} {{a mechanism for}} the rider to apply the brakes, such as brake levers or pedals; a mechanism for transmitting that signal, such as Bowden cables, hydraulic hoses, rods, or the bicycle chain; and the brake mechanism itself, a caliper or drum, to press two or more surfaces together in order to convert, via friction, kinetic energy of <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> rider into thermal energy to be dissipated.|$|E

25|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass of <b>the</b> <b>bike</b> <b>and</b> rider is only lowered and not moved out, but if {{the front of the}} bike is free to swivel about its steering axis, the lean to the right will cause it to steer to the right by some combination of gyroscopic precession, ground reaction forces, gravitational force on an off-axis {{center of mass}} or simply the inertia of an off-axis center of mass depending on the exact geometry and mass distribution of the particular bike and the amount of torque and the speed at which it is applied.|$|E
