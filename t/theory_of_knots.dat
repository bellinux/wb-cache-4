Mathematical studies of knots began in the 19th century with Gauss, who defined the linking integral [...] [...] In the 1860s, Lord Kelvin's theory that atoms were knots in the aether led to Peter Guthrie Tait's creation of the first knot tables for complete classification. Tait, in 1885, published a table of knots with up to ten crossings, and {{what came to be}} known as the Tait conjectures. [...] This record motivated the early knot theorists, but knot theory eventually became part of the emerging subject of topology.|$|E

40|$|A brief {{review of}} the {{development}} <b>of</b> Chern-Simons gauge <b>theory</b> since its relation to knot theory was discovered in 1988 is presented. The presentation is done guided by a dictionary which relates knot theory concepts to quantum field theory ones. From the basic objects in both contexts the quantities leading to knot and link invariants are introduced and analyzed. The quantum field theory approaches {{that have been developed}} to compute these quantities are reviewed. Perturbative approaches lead to Vassiliev or finite type invariants. Nonperturbative ones lead to polynomial or quantum group invariants. In addition, a brief discussion on open problems and future developments is included. In 1988, Edward Witten established the connection between Chern-Simons gauge theory and the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>knot</b> and link invariants [34].

40|$|Abstract: I {{present a}} summary of the recent {{progress}} made in field and string theory which has led to a reformulation of quantum-group polynomial invariants for knots and links into new polynomial invariants whose coefficients can be described in topological terms. The approach opens a new point of view in the <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>knot</b> and link invariants.

The main goal of this short note is to present {{a summary of}} these recent developments. Chern-Simons gauge theory is a topological quantum field theory whose action is built out of a Chern-Simons term involving as gauge field a gauge connection associated to a group G on a three-manifold M. Its natural observables are Wilson loops, W K R, where K is a loop and R a representation of the gauge group. The vacuum expectation values of products of these operators are topological invariants which are related to quantum-group polynomial invariants.
