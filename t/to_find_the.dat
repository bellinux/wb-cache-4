Several traditional approaches like dynamic programming, lambda-iteration and gradient method are utilized <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out <b>the</b> optimal solution of non-linear problem. More recently, the soft computing techniques have received more attention and were used in a number of successful and practical applications. The purpose of this work is <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out <b>the</b> advantages of application of the evolutionary computing technique and Augmented lagrangian Particle Swarm Optimization (ALPSO) in particular to the economic load dispatch problem. Here, an attempt has been made <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out <b>the</b> minimum cost by using ALPSO using the data of three generating systems. All the techniques are implemented in MATLAB environment.
