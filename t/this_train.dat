5|$|Between 1981 and 1983, Pennsylvanian {{equipment}} was turned every night {{to operate a}} second state-supported train, the Fort Pitt, which ran from Pittsburgh to Altoona. Amtrak withdrew <b>this</b> <b>train</b> in early 1983 after the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) declined to continue subsidizing the increased operation. At the time the Fort Pitt carried 30 passengers per day. On October 30, 1983, the Pennsylvanian was extended to New York City, eliminating the transfer at Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Since 2003, the MTA has {{operated}} a Holiday Train on Sundays in November and December, {{from the first}} Sunday after Thanksgiving to the Sunday before Christmas Day. <b>This</b> <b>train</b> was made of cars from the R1 through R9 series. The route made all stops between Second Avenue in Manhattan and Queens Plaza in Queens via the IND Sixth Avenue Line and the IND Queens Boulevard Line. In 2011, the train operated on Saturdays instead of Sundays.|$|E

50|$|Practical {{training}} at police stations covers Anti-crime (I), Investigation (II), Detective (III) and Traffic (IV) areas. <b>This</b> <b>training</b> starts from the winter semester of the 2nd year, and during <b>this</b> <b>training</b> period, students acquire field experiences. The training also helps the students acquire the experience {{needed for the}} entry level administrative staff. Besides <b>this</b> <b>training</b> for which two credits are given, there are field trip programs to crime-related {{institutions such as the}} headquarters of police and courts and correctional institutes.|$|R
5|$|Because {{it was a}} {{self-contained}} section of the London Underground that was closed outside weekday peak hours, Aldwych station and the branch line from Holborn were popular locations for filming scenes set on the Tube even before their closure. Since the branch's closure in 1994, its use in film productions has continued, with the station appearing as itself and, with appropriate signage, as other stations on the network. The track and infrastructure are maintained in operational condition, and a train of ex-Northern line 1972 tube stock is permanently stabled on the branch. <b>This</b> <b>train</b> can be driven {{up and down the}} branch for filming. The physical connection with the Piccadilly line northbound tracks remains, but requires manual operation.|$|E
5|$|To {{catch the}} public's attention, <b>this</b> <b>train</b> {{was not simply}} rolled out of the factory; it made a dash {{from one end of}} the CB, in Denver, to the other, in Chicago on May 26, 1934. The {{railroad}} spared no expense in planning the operations. All other trains along the Zephyrs route were diverted to sidings and the turnouts were spiked into the proper alignment for the Zephyrs run. Track and maintenance of way workers checked every spike and bolt along the train's route to ensure that there would not be any problems, and temporary speed signs were installed along the route to warn the Zephyrs crew of curves that would be dangerous at high speeds. On the day of the dash, every road grade crossing was manned by a flagman to stop automobile traffic ahead of the train and to ensure that the crossing was clear. Stations along the route were protected by local police officers and members of the American Legion and the Boy Scouts of America.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{measures}} in Vietnam, 2,000 Indochinese soldiers returning from service in France were sent on indefinite leave {{and were not}} replaced with new recruits from Vietnam. The reason is put down by historians {{to be due to}} the fact that military discipline in France was less regimented than in Indochina and other colonial garrisons. In colonial units, the colonial military and social order with Frenchmen above their colonised troops was more easily reproduced. Metropolitan officers also treated their Vietnamese subordinates on a more equitable basis, making the Vietnamese less likely to accept the discrimination upon return to Vietnam. Overseas Vietnamese soldiers could become so alienated with their experiences that they became soft targets for communist propaganda. Upon returning home, they attempted to indoctrinate other troops with their Marxist doctrine. <b>This</b> <b>train</b> of thought further reinforced French perception that subversive ideas came from the outside rather than domestically: of the 57 soldiers involved in the mutiny, 17 had served abroad. On the other hand, according to the Thiry report, the proportion of soldiers with foreign service at Yen Bay did not exceed that in other garrisons, so this was not abnormal.|$|E

5|$|On December 4, 1946, Harrison set {{out from}} Shanghai with {{approximately}} 50 tonnes of supplies. On <b>this</b> <b>train</b> journey, {{he was to be}} accompanied by a Russian UNRRA worker and Chinese welfare representatives. Due to repeated Kuomintang inspections, the train journey constantly suffered from delays. The first such delay occurred at Nanjing and lasted four days; the second such delay, at Xuzhou, was of equal duration. At one station, the medical supplies were unhooked from the train's engine car and left on a bleak plain. The two UNRRA workers did not have clean water to drink and were forced to boil ditch water which was polluted with human waste. To add to the dire situation, Harrison's blanket and shoes were stolen, and due to the cold, he began to suffer from frostbite. Two weeks after Harrison left Shanghai, his train was permitted to move again, but there were problems still ahead. At each one of the 20 stations en route to Kaifeng, the train was delayed for up to three hours. Upon arrival at Kaifeng, the journey had to be completed by truck and ox cart. After completing one delivery, he returned to Kaifeng to pick up a second load, but could not continue past the Zhangqiu branch of the receiving hospital. Harrison died of exposure on January 10, 1947, near Kaifeng in China, aged 66.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of the Grand Canyon Diorama in 1958 prompted changes to the Retlaw 2 freight train pulled by the DRR's No. 1 locomotive, which involved adding side-facing bench seating pointed towards Disneyland and red-and-white striped awnings {{on all of the}} cattle cars and gondolas. The walls on the cattle cars facing the park were also removed to allow for better views of the diorama. That same year, a third gondola with the same modifications as the other gondolas was added, and a fourth gondola with the same attributes was added in 1959. This brought the total number of freight cars in the train set, now referred to by Disneyland employees as Holiday Red, to eight. Prior to these modifications, the cattle cars and gondolas of <b>this</b> <b>train</b> set had no seating, requiring passengers to stand {{for the duration of the}} ride. Despite safety concerns voiced by Ward Kimball related to the lack of seats on these train cars, Walt Disney, for the purpose of authenticity, had insisted that there be no seats on them; he wanted the passengers to feel like cattle on an actual cattle train.|$|E
