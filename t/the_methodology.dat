40|$|This {{document}} {{is the result}} of a project motivated by an organization with the responsibility of advising clients who are purchasing applications software. Presently, recommendations are made in a less than optimal manner, and the organization is searching for an evaluation methodology on which to base this recommendation. The purpose of this project is to identify, characterize (summarize), and classify existing <b>methodologies</b> for <b>the</b> evaluation and selection of software products. This project has identified, characterized, and classified eleven distinct software evaluation and selection methodologies that are described in sections 4 through 14 of this document. They are:.
