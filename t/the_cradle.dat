40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{mitigating}} the visually displeasing effects of cradling in X-ray images of panel paintings. The proposed algorithm consists of three stages. In the first stage the location of <b>the</b> <b>cradling</b> is detected semi-automatically and the grayscale inconsistency, caused by the thickness of <b>the</b> <b>cradling,</b> is adjusted. In a second stage we use a blind source separation method to decompose the X-ray image into a so-called cartoon part and a texture part, where the latter contains mostly the wood grain from both the panel as well as <b>the</b> <b>cradling.</b> In <b>the</b> third and final stage the algorithm tries to learn the distinction between the texture patterns that originate from <b>the</b> <b>cradling</b> and those from other components such as the panel and/or the painting. The goal of the proposed research is to improve the readability of X-ray images of paintings for art experts...|$|R

5|$|In the mid-1920s Nick Prata (as he {{was then}} known) began working in the film industry, doing odd jobs around the set for Fox Film, such as prop boy, script clerk, and {{assistant}} cameraman. While working as an assistant on Raoul Walsh's What Price Glory? in 1926, Prata was given a screen test, after which his name was changed to Nick Stuart. Shortly after, he became Howard Hawks's personal assistant. He appeared in minor roles in two film shorts, before being {{given an opportunity to}} act in a featured role by Hawks, in 1927's, <b>The</b> <b>Cradle</b> Snatchers. After the success of <b>The</b> <b>Cradle</b> Snatchers, Stuart would star in several shorts, many of which again paired him with his Snatchers co-star, Sally Phipps, which included Gentlemen Prefer Scotch, and Cupid and the Clock (based on a short story by O. Henry). The two would star in Stuart's next three films in 1927 and 1928: High School Hero, Why Sailors Go Wrong, and News Parade. Stuart's next role was that of Sandy, starring alongside Victor McLaglen in William K. Howard's The River Pirate in 1928. Stuart and Sue Carol had been linked together romantically since early in 1928, and would co-star in Stuart's next project, Girls Gone Wild.|$|E

5|$|This {{species of}} {{wildebeest}} {{seems to have}} evolved around 2.5 million years ago. The black wildebeest {{is believed to have}} diverged from the blue wildebeest to become a distinct species around a million years ago, in the mid to late Pleistocene. Fossil evidence suggests that the blue wildebeest were quite common in <b>the</b> <b>Cradle</b> of Humankind in the past. Apart from eastern Africa, fossils are commonly found in Elandsfontein, Cornelia and Florisbad.|$|E

He described Iran as <b>the</b> <b>cradle</b> of his family, though he never lived there. When he was a child, his paternal grandmother used to recite to him the great epic poems of Persian history. He held French, Iranian, and Swiss citizenship, and was fluent in French, English, German and Italian, while also speaking some Persian and Arabic.|$|E
5|$|Blue {{wildebeest}} fossils {{dating back}} some {{two and a}} half million years ago are common and widespread. They have been found in the fossil bearing caves at <b>the</b> <b>Cradle</b> of Humankind north of Johannesburg. Elsewhere in South Africa they are plentiful at such sites as Elandsfontein, Cornelia and Florisbad. The earliest fossils of the black wildebeest were found in sedimentary rock in Cornelia in the Orange Free State and dated back about eight hundred thousand years. Today, five subspecies of the blue wildebeest are recognised while the black wildebeest has no named subspecies.|$|E

5|$|Charles Darwin {{had argued}} that {{humanity}} evolved in Africa, because this is where great apes like gorillas and chimpanzees lived. Though Darwin's claims have since been vindicated by the fossil record, they were proposed without any fossil evidence. Other scientific authorities disagreed with him, like Charles Lyell, a geologist, and Alfred Russel Wallace, who had thought {{of the theory of}} evolution around the same time as Darwin. Because both Lyell and Wallace believed that humans were more closely related to gibbons and orangutans, they identified Southeast Asia as <b>the</b> <b>cradle</b> of humanity because this is where these apes lived. Dutch anatomist Eugène Dubois favored the latter theory, and sought to confirm it.|$|E

Johor Bahru became <b>the</b> <b>cradle</b> of Malay nationalism after the war and gave birth to a political party named United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) in 1946. After the formation of Malaysia in 1963, Johor Bahru retained its status as state capital and was granted city status in 1994. A central business district was developed in the city centre during the 1990s. More development funds were channelled to the city after the introduction of Iskandar Malaysia in 2006.|$|E

The satellite was carried {{in the rear of the}} shuttle's payload bay, and was boosted into a geosynchronous transfer orbit by a Payload Assist Module (PAM-D), a small solid rocket upper stage, after its release from the orbiter. The satellite, with its upper stage, massed a total of , with <b>the</b> <b>cradle</b> massing another , and had cost around $50 million.|$|E
5|$|The symphonic {{poems of}} the Hungarian {{composer}} Franz Liszt are {{a series of}} 13 orchestral works, numbered S.95–107. The first 12 were composed between 1848 and 1858 (though some use material conceived earlier); the last, Von der Wiege bis zum Grabe (From <b>the</b> <b>Cradle</b> to the Grave), followed in 1882. These works helped establish the genre of orchestral program musiccompositions written to illustrate an extra-musical plan derived from a play, poem, painting or work of nature. They inspired the symphonic poems of Bedřich Smetana, Antonín Dvořák, Richard Strauss and others.|$|E
5|$|Expressionist {{architecture}} {{developed in}} the 1910s in Germany and influenced Art Deco and other modern styles, with e.g. Fritz Höger, Erich Mendelsohn, Dominikus Böhm, and Fritz Schumacher being influential architects.

Consequently, Germany is often considered <b>the</b> <b>cradle</b> of modern architecture and design. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe became one of the world's most renowned architects {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. He conceived of the glass façade skyscraper.

5|$|Natalya {{programs}} {{the satellite}} to initiate atmospheric re-entry and destroy itself. As Trevelyan captures Natalya and orders Grishenko {{to save the}} satellite, Boris unwittingly triggers an explosion with Bond's pen grenade (received earlier from Q), which allows Bond to escape to the antenna cradle. Bond sabotages the antenna, preventing Grishenko from regaining control of the satellite. Bond and Trevelyan fight on the antenna's suspended platform, which finishes with Bond holding a dangling Trevelyan by his foot. Bond releases Trevelyan, who plummets into the dish. Seconds later <b>the</b> <b>cradle</b> explodes, and falls, crushing and killing Trevelyan and destroying the base. Amazingly, Boris survives, but is frozen solid in a cascade of liquid nitrogen. Natalya commandeers a helicopter and rescues Bond. It drops them in a field, where the couple are rescued by Wade {{and a team of}} Marines.|$|E
