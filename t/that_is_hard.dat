A key element in making ransomware work for the attacker is a convenient payment system <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to trace. A range of such payment methods have been used, including wire transfers, premium-rate text messages, pre-paid voucher services such as Paysafecard, and the digital currency Bitcoin. A 2016 survey commissioned by Citrix claimed that larger businesses are holding bitcoin as contingency plans.|$|E
5|$|This species' call is a distinctive, plaintive cooOOoo-woo-woo-woooo, {{uttered by}} males to attract females, {{and may be}} mistaken for the call of an owl at first. (Close up, a grating or throat-rattling sound may be heard {{preceding}} the first coo.) Other sounds include a nest call (cooOOoo) by paired males to attract their mates to the nest sites, a greeting call (a soft ork) by males upon rejoining their mates, and an alarm call (a short roo-oo) by either male or female when threatened. In flight, the wings make a fluttery whistling sound <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to hear. The wing whistle is much louder and more noticeable upon take-off and landing.|$|E

She is also emotional, and when Charlie asks her a question <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> for her to understand (what she would do if Leslie disappeared), she becomes distraught, leading to a confrontation. Leslie shares Charlie's attitude; he does not trust the humans and regards most everything they say with skepticism.

Leslie decides that he and Sarah will stay on land when Nancy and Charlie, albeit reluctantly, offer to help them.|$|E

He believed that both [...] "passion and craft" [...] could be seen in her draughtsmanship, but that it also displayed [...] "a guilelessness <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to relate to in our post post-ironic moment". He also discussed her lost multi-coloured watercolour paintings that were featured in Harrington's The Wormwood Star, suggesting that they were akin to a storyboard for an unrealised film by the director Alejandro Jodorowsky.|$|E

500|$|Reviews of Kids Can Say No! have {{generally}} been negative, with initial reviews doubting the benefit of showing the film to children and later reviews focusing on Harris' hypocrisy. In a 1985 Times review, Caroline Moorehead writes that the film's avoidance of an explicit discussion of sexual abuse was both a requirement and the film's greatest weakness. According to Moorehead, an explicit discussion might have terrified children and prevented parents from consenting to their children's viewing of the film; however, its oblique approach prevents children from understanding the issue. She calls the film's theme song [...] "catchy, one of those irritating snatches of music <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>hard</b> to forget".|$|E

According to Carmen Johnson of Prefix magazine, the album has Tommy Guerrero, a San Francisco-native, [...] "oozing soul in every track".
