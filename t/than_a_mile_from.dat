5|$|In late 2004, a man {{allegedly}} gave Murray's {{father a}} rusty, stained knife {{that belonged to}} the man's brother, who had a criminal past and lived less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> where the car was discovered. His brother and his brother's girlfriend were said to have acted strangely after the disappearance, and the man's brother claimed he believed the knife had been used to kill Murray.

5|$|With {{his main}} and mizzen masts {{collapsed}} and escape impossible, Leissègues turned his ship towards the shore at 11:30, outdistancing the {{fire from the}} drifting Northumberland and leaving Superb behind, Duckworth reluctant to risk his ship in the shallow coastal shoals. Canopus maintained the pressure, pursuing the French flagship until it was clear at 11:40 that Impérial was hard aground on a coral reef, less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> the beach. Diomède, under attack by Atlas and the recently returned Spencer, followed Impérial ashore. As they struck the reef, both French ships lost their remaining masts and suffered severe damage to their hulls. Their crews then gathered on deck and made preparations to abandon ship as the British squadron pulled back {{out of range of}} fire from the shore. During the engagement the French frigates and corvette had all slipped between the battling squadrons and the shoreline and escaped to the westwards. The British frigates were too preoccupied with boarding and towing prizes to initiate a chase.|$|E
5|$|Just after Cole's C-130 left Khâm Đức, a C-123 {{flown by}} Major Ray D. Shelton landed {{and took out}} 44 U.S. {{engineers}} and 21 South Vietnamese civilians. Shortly after Shelton had landed his aircraft, he reported that enemy fire was coming in from all quadrants, but {{he was able to}} take off safely after just three minutes on the ground. By 11:10, just 145 people had been evacuated by Shelton's aircraft, and a handful of helicopters. After that, another three C-130s also arrived in the vicinity of Khâm Đức, but the pilots were told not to try landings. In the afternoon, the C-130 Hercules resumed their operations; at 15:25, Major Bernard L. Bucher's C-130 approached Khâm Đức's airfield from the south and landed despite taking numerous hits. Some 150 Vietnamese women and children rushed onto the aircraft; as soon as the aircraft was full, Bucher made his takeoff in the north direction, unaware that opposing forces were concentrated in that area. At 15:30 Bucher took off, and his aircraft was quickly riddled by ground fire; it crashed less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> the end of the runway. All the South Vietnamese civilians and the U.S. aircrew died in the crash.|$|E

25|$|Upton {{today is}} most notable for its central {{location}} between Birkenhead and West Kirby. The {{consequence of this}} is that road transport through Upton is uncharacteristically efficient for the rural suburban area of Wirral. Upton is situated at the junction of roads from Birkenhead, Moreton (the A551), Greasby (the B5139), Saughall Massie and Arrowe Park (the A551). The road network was further enhanced with the building of a bypass (the A5027) in the early 1980s. The M53 motorway, at Junction 2, is situated less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> the centre of the village and connects directly to the bypass.|$|E

25|$|Just {{minutes before}} the murder, Sheriff's Deputy Don Welch had driven by and spotted Lunsford {{speaking}} to the men. Moments after the murder, Welch witnessed the suspects speed past him in their vehicle. Welch immediately {{drove back to the}} spot where Lunsford had been and found his dead body. Welch radioed for help, and at around 2:00a.m., Chief Deputy Stanaland, another colleague of Lunsford, found them both. Stanaland noticed the video camera in Lunsford's cruiser. He rewound the video, watched it over and then made a copy of it. The three suspects, realizing Welch had spotted them, abandoned their vehicle less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> the town of Garrison. They then fled on foot, taking the marijuana with them. Their vehicle was found later in the day.|$|E
25|$|While rescue {{efforts were}} {{underway}} {{to look for}} people under the destroyed structures, few were aware that another violent tornado would strike the area. The path of the second tornado, which formed at 7:35pm CDT was 50 miles in length, also had a peak width of 500 yards, and the storm formed along the north bank Tennessee River less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> {{the path of the}} earlier storm; with much of its path very closely paralleling its predecessor as it tore through Limestone and Madison Counties. 22 people were killed by this second tornado. Tanner was the first community to be hit, and many structures that were left standing after the first tornado were destroyed in the second one. A man injured at Lawson's Trailer Park in the first tornado was taken to a church in the area, which collapsed in the second tornado, killing him.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, gold mining had petered out and Hearst began buying up property in the area. Over the next two decades, he amassed land holdings covering the entirety of four of the ten Mexican land grants and most of Jolon. On top of the old Rancho Milpitas main ranch house site, {{at the edge of a}} small bluff less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> <b>from</b> and overlooking the old mission, Hearst hired Morgan to build a new ranch headquarters. Construction on the Mission Revival-styled building complex began in 1929, using poured concrete instead of adobe. A smoothly domed north tower was built in Moorish Revival style above the main living quarters. Original plans for the building were for it to include housing for 20 employees but this was expanded to 30 during construction. A proposed southern wing for Hearst's private quarters was never completed. Materials were carried from Santa Cruz in a Fageol truck. Construction costs totaled $200,000.|$|E
