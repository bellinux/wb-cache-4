5|$|<b>The</b> <b>tabernacle</b> has {{two main}} outside entrances; {{one to the}} south, facing the Zócalo and the other facing east toward Seminario Street. The {{southern}} façade is more richly decorated than the east façade. It has a theme of glorifying the Eucharist with images of the Apostles, Church Fathers, saints who founded religious orders, martyrs as well as scenes from the Bible. Zoomorphic reliefs can be found along with the anthropologic reliefs, including a rampaging lion, and the eagle from the coat of arms of Mexico. The east facade is less ambitious, but contains figures from the Old Testament {{as well as the}} images of John Nepomucene and Ignacio de Loyola.

5|$|The Annunciation was {{a popular}} theme in European art, {{although}} a difficult scene to paint, because it depicts Mary's union with Christ as she becomes <b>the</b> <b>tabernacle</b> for the Word made flesh. Mary as Theotokos, the God-bearer, was affirmed in 431 at the Council of Ephesus; two decades later the Council of Chalcedon affirmed the doctrine of Incarnation– that Christ was of two natures (God and Man)– and her perpetual virginity was affirmed at the Lateran Council of 631. In Byzantine art, Annunciation scenes depict the Virgin enthroned and dressed in royal regalia. In later centuries she was shown in enclosed spaces: the temple, the church, the garden.|$|E

However, in the 18thcentury, it was decided to build a structure that was separate, but still connected, to the main cathedral. It is constructed of tezontle (a reddish porous volcanic rock) and white stone {{in the shape of a}} Greek cross with its southern facade faces the Zócalo. It is connected to the main cathedral via the Chapel of San Isidro.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the church were {{completely}} restored in 2003. At {{the same time the}} altar was moved closer to the congregation, making more room for the choir.

5|$|The {{majority}} of private piers situated upon {{the western and}} northern ends of Galveston Bay were destroyed {{as a result of}} Debra's storm surge. Damage primarily constituted to roofs, glass, sign boards, antennas, and certain sea vessels; abundant damage was caused by rising waters due to torrential rains. Approximately 90cattle were killed on the western edge of Galveston Island. Furniture was thrown from the luxury Buccaneer Hotel into its swimming pool, shattering a large window. In Fort Worth, the entrance to <b>the</b> <b>Tabernacle</b> Baptist Church was completely destroyed, with its remnants littering the adjacent road. The largest quantity of damage to sea vessels was consolidated near the Kemah-Baytown area. Widespread damage from winds and tides was evident in the Hitchcock area, where three men were rescued after attempting to endure the hurricane at a fishing camp, although they were later rescued. In the Houston area, damage was limited to power lines and downed trees. At the former Houston International Airport, air transport was terminated, and water transportation was impeded as vast ships remained in ports. Onlookers were advised not to touch downed power lines, and electricity was knocked out at a hospital and roads were immersed in floodwaters. Most rail and road traffic in Houston was significantly interrupted.|$|E
