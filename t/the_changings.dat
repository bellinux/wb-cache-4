Recently, the debate on how to measure the well-being, both for individuals and societies, has been an important issue for policy makers and public opinion. <b>The</b> <b>changings</b> of the last years (in life styles, economy, energy, environment) have pointed out the necessity to develop new statistical measures capable of guiding decision-makers, firms’ and citizens’ behaviors. The statement is that economic parameters alone are unsatisfactory / inadequate to evaluate societies’ progress and “should be complemented by social and environmental information and by measures of inequality and sustainability” (Istat-Cnel, 2014). In Italy, the project “Equitable and sustainable Well-being” was born by a joint initiative of National Council for Economics and Labour (Cnel) and the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat) and it’s still available to receive researchers’ contributions to properly define the Well-being dimension. Well-being dimension is actually composed by 12 areas: Health, Education and training, Work and life balance, Economic well-being, Social relationships, Politics and Institutions, Security, Subjective well-being, Landscape and cultural heritage, Environment, Research and innovation, Quality of services. The dimensions are measured by way of 134 indicators in total, whose data come from different but official sources. In the first part, the paper deals with some remarks about the objective and subjective indicators belonging to the set.

In order to solve or protect the land, the authorized agencies should have immediate planning to manage the coastal zone effectively and sustainably especially if the sea level rise from global warming. Remote sensing has been used to detect the coastline change both from natural and man-made causes in various parts of Thailand. Landsat satellite data were analysed to quantify the rate of change at the Chao Phraya river-mouth, Eastern parts of the Southern Peninsular and Mapthaput Industrial Estate area. The role of protection of mangrove forest at Ban Laem Sing, western side of the Chao Phraya river-mouth were exemplified by Landsat data. The changing patterns of sediment plume from this major river of Thailand which effects the changing coastline also were detected by Landsat data. One of the major cause of severe coastal erosion during winter of 2007 was evident from scatterometer and altimeter data. Many causes of coastal erosion by human activities can be shown by satellite data.

40|$|SUMMARY Freshwater ponds on the Frisian {{islands are}} {{frequently}} subject to seawater-flooding. Since the underground {{of the islands}} contains almost pure seasand, the heavy water of high salt-contents usually sinks into deeper underground-layers instantly, and fresh water can be restored by rainfall. The result is a region of brackish waters which change their salt-contents permanently, following an irregular scheme of time. These ponds are inhabited mainly by Cladocera, a group of small Crustacea. Population cycles occur in Cladocera, insofar as parthenogenetic reproduction alternates with the production of gamogenetic resting-eggs. The salt-resistance of active animals suffices for them to bear salt contents up to ß-oligohaline values or less, but the resistance of resting-eggs helps the species to survive in pure sea-water. The beginning of a population cycle is marked {{by the development of}} females from resting-eggs. This happens when suitable life conditions, including suitable salt-contents, are present. Since there is no inherent scheme of time in Cladocera, population cycles can follow the irregular scheme of desalinations. So Cladocera can actively coordinate their periods of parthenogenetic reproduction with periods of low salt contents in different ponds. Resting-eggs can be transported by birds and cattle. A possible extermination of a species in one pond or another caused by the seawater-flooding of an active population need not {{be the end of the}} species on the island, since a resettlement from neighbouring ponds may occur which were not reached by the flood or which contained resting-eggs at the time of inundation.

Methodology/methods: Scientific literature analysis in order to disclose the coverage, specifics of the health tourism industry, and comparative statistical data analysis on the general and health tourism are done. Scientific aim: The article deals with the specificity of the health tourism services industry, its participators, value for the customer, distinguishing similar tourism subsectors, forms, trends in the development of health tourism in Lithuania. Findings: The results of the survey show the idiosyncrasy in <b>the</b> <b>changings</b> in the health tourism services industry in the Lithuanian market comparing to the general tourism. The amount of the health tourism services establishments is decreasing, as opposite to the number of general tourism. It is not bad trend for the health tourism, as the size of the establishment is growing. Incomes per health tourist are larger comparing to the general tourists, as health tourists stay shorter, but pay more. There are some changes also in the profile of the health tourism services customer. The evaluation of the health tourism services quality is also better than the general tourism at all. Conclusions: Findings show that here are some differences in the dynamics of analysed tourism forms. The health tourism becomes to be more concentrated; services centres are growing. The duration of the stay of the health tourist is shorter, but more profitable, and the quality is evaluated better comparing to the health tourism services used by Lithuanian tourists abroad.

40|$|Background: Presence of {{epinephrine}} {{in local}} anesthetic cartridge increases {{the duration of}} local anesthesia (LA), decreases the risk of toxicity, and provides hemostasis. However, the unfavorable effects are increasing heart rate (HR) and raising blood pressure (BP). The aim was to evaluate hemodynamic changes in the BP, HR, and oxygen saturation (SpO 2) of normal patients undergoing tooth extraction using LA with various epinephrine concentrations. Material and Methods: A prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted on 120 patients who were divided randomly into 3 parallel groups according to the LA received. Group 1 : lidocaine 2 % with epinephrine 1 : 80, 000 (L 80). Group 2 : articaine 4 % with epinephrine 1 : 100, 000 (A 100). Group 3 : articaine 4 % with epinephrine 1 : 200, 000 (A 200). Inclusion criteria: normal patients whose BP < 140 / 90. Exclusion criteria: hypertension, cardiovascular disease, hyperthyroidism, pregnancy, and allergy to LA. BP, HR, and (SpO 2) were evaluated in 3 different time points: 3 minutes before LA, 3 minutes after LA, and 3 minutes after extraction. Results: Systolic blood pressure (SBP) significantly increased after injection of L 80 and continued after extraction to be significant than pre-injection. SBP significantly increased after injection of A 100 then decreased after extraction. In the group of A 200, SBP insignificantly decreased after injection then increased after extraction. The increasing of SBP between time point 1 and 2 was significantly higher in G 1 than G 3 (p = 0. 014). Diastolic blood pressure decreased after LA in the 3 groups; however it was significant only with L 80, then increased after extraction for all. Conclusions: <b>The</b> <b>changings</b> of DBP, HR and SpO 2 after anesthesia and extraction showed no significant difference among the three groups. However, A 200 had significant lesser effect on SBP than L 80 and the least effect on other parameters.

Partiu-se do problema que este tipo de sociedade vem enfrentando, ou seja, cálculo de impostos e contribuições com base na receita bruta, receita esta que não pertence à cooperativa, além da apresentação das informações contábeis dessas entidades, que por se tratar de sociedade sui generis, em função de seu aspecto doutrinário, não vem recebendo tratamento contábil de forma adequada. Iniciou-se a pesquisa com uma síntese da origem e da evolução do cooperativismo no mundo, seus precursores, a formação e evolução do pensamento cooperativista, de sua doutrina, dos seus princípios e normas, proporcionando assim o entendimento do funcionamento deste tipo de sociedade, seus aspectos doutrinários próprios, que a diferenciam do restante das sociedades, além de se conseguir identificar as transações que ocorrem entre elas e seus cooperados, assim como as transações de cada um separadamente, {{inclusive}} com a possibilidade de registrá-las. Posteriormente é realizado um estudo do sistema contábil para que, embasado nesta teoria, se consiga discutir e conceituar as receitas, despesas e custos das cooperativas e dos cooperados, bem como, ao mesmo tempo, definir quais os procedimentos contábeis corretos para estas operações. Com isso, buscou-se referencial teórico para sustentar as propostas de modificação tanto nos procedimentos como, por conseqüência, nas demonstrações contábeis das sociedades cooperativas, que foram realizadas de forma a mostrar as receitas, as despesas e os custos destas e de seus cooperados separadamente, fazendo com que a demonstração de resultado se apresente com o resultado da cooperativa e o patrimônio dela se apresente com sua forma própria, seguindo-se os aspectos doutrinários deste tipo de sociedade. Por fim, as propostas de modificações estudadas teoricamente são testadas e comparadas por meio de sua aplicação em demonstrações contábeis de uma cooperativa do ramo de trabalho. This {{research has}} as theme A contribution for the structuring {{of the proceedings}} and cooperatives accounting demonstrations - applied to a working cooperative and it shows a proposal of the structure changing not only the proceedings but also the accounting demonstrations of the cooperative society starting from the problem which this kind of society has been going through, that is, the taxation and contribution based on gross revenue, which doesnt belong to the cooperative, besides the accounting presentation of themselves, that deal with the society sui generis related to its indocrinate aspect, it hasnt been getting an accounting treatment appropriately. The research began with the origin synthesis and the cooperativism {{in the world and}} its forerunners, the formation and evolution of cooperative thought, its doctrine, its principles and rules, making possible the understanding of the function of this kind of society, its own doctrine aspects which makes the difference {{from the rest of the}} societies, besides getting to identify the transactions which occurs among them and their member of a cooperative, as well as the transaction of each one separatedly, including the possibilities of registering them. Afterwards it is achieved a study of the accounting system so that based on this theory we can think it over and name this revenues, expenses and costs of the cooperatives and their members, not to mention, at the same time define which are the correct accounting proceedings for these operations. With this, people searched for theorical referencial to back up the proposal of <b>the</b> <b>changings</b> in the proceedings as well as, by consequences, in the accounting demonstrations of the cooperative societies, which were achieved in a way to show their revenues and costs and also their members separatedly, making the demonstration of the results show along with the cooperative one and their corporate assets shows with its own way following the doctrine aspects of this kind of society. Finally, the proposal for the changing theorically studied, is tried and compared by means of its application in accounting demonstrations of a cooperative type of work...|$|E

Amparado pelas discussÃes gadamerianas, parte-se do âpreconceito inicialâ, de que tais discursos sÃo passÃveis de uma crÃtica Ãtica. Os discursos que prescrevem jeitos de ser, sentir, falar e comportar-se no trabalho, sÃo primeiramente visados em textos informativos do cotidiano, presentes em um jornal e uma revista. Tais textos, apresentados de forma exemplificativa, funcionam como disparadores das questÃes centrais a serem enfrentadas pelo trabalho: seria possÃvel {{articular}} uma crÃtica de fundamentaÃÃo Ãtica a tais discursos? Em que eles seriam injustos? O recurso Ã crÃtica que se articula no campo psicossociolÃgico Ã o movimento inicial da pesquisa. Encontra-se um pensamento crÃtico articulado acerca da distÃncia dos discursos que âprescrevem autonomiaâ e que âobrigam a participarâ, por exemplo. Trata-se de um discurso paradoxal. Percebe-se o lugar de destaque da Teoria do Capital Humano como tecnologia de âautogestÃoâ, âinternalizaÃÃo do controleâ. Passa-se pela contextualizaÃÃo do discurso no campo mais amplo das transformaÃÃes sociais pelas quais passa a sociedade contemporÃnea lÃquida e suas inversÃes das responsabilidades pÃblicas e privadas. O discurso normativo do bom comportamento acompanha, ou vem acompanhado, das transformaÃÃes da sociedade privatizada, que cria o sujeito psicologizado. Enfrenta-se, por fim, o desafio de elaborar uma crÃtica que se faÃa notar como eminentemente Ãtica. A noÃÃo de subjetividade enquanto passividade frente ao Outro traz o Dizer Ãtico de LÃvinas ao dito do texto acadÃmico. O solo da Ãtica Ã o encontro face ao Outro, Ãnico Outro, desnecessidade de leis, de regras. Com a entrada em cena do Terceiro, sempre a partir de LÃvinas, tenta-se articular uma justiÃa que seja o equivalente social do apelo Ãtico da paridade eu-Outro. O julgamento Ãtico se faz necessÃrio com o Terceiro. Entram em cena as regras, as leis, o direito. O discurso prescritivo do âbom comportamentoâ no trabalho se revela como uma lei injusta sem Alteridade. O encurvamento do eu sobre si na autogestÃo do Capital Humano mostra-se como fechamento ao Estrangeiro. O preconceito inicial de que tais discursos sÃo passÃveis de uma crÃtica Ãtica parece legÃtimo. This is {{a theoretical}} {{study on the}} normativity of speech which guides the âgood behaviorâ at work. Based on Gadamerian discussions, we start from the âinitial prejudiceâ, which states the speech is subject to a critical ethics. The speech which regulate the ways of being, feeling, speaking and behaving at work are primarily seen in daily informative texts, such as newspapers and magazines. Such texts, presented in a sample way, work as triggers of the main question to be faced at work: {{is it possible to}} articulate a critique of ethical basis to these kinds of speech? How fair would they be? The resource to the critiques articulated in the psycho-sociological field is the starting point of this research. An argumentative articulated thought about the distance between the speeches that âprescribe autonomyâ and the ones that âobligate participationâ, for example, could be found. It is about a paradoxical speech. We could also notice the importance of the Human Capital Theory as the âself-managementâ technology and âcontrol internalizationâ. We explore the speech contextualization in the large field of social transformations which the net contemporary society goes through and its inversions of public and private responsibilities. The normative speech of good behavior follows, or is followed by, <b>the</b> <b>changings</b> of the privatized society, which creates the psychologized subject. Lastly, we face the challenge of elaborating a critique which is eminently ethical. The notion of subjectivity as passivity before the Other brings LÃvinas&# 8223; ethical saying to the academic text. The Ethics&# 8223; soil stands for the meeting facing the Other, only Other, needless of rules and laws. With the Third coming in, always according to LÃvinas, it is articulated a justice which is the social equivalent of the ethical appeal about the me-Other parity. The ethical judgement is made with the Third. Then, the rules, laws and rights come into the scene. The prescriptive speech of âgood behaviorâ at work shows itself as an unfair law without Alterity. The self-curving over itself at the self-management of Human Capital is shown as the closing to the Other. The initial prejudice which state these kinds of speech are passive of an ethical critique seems rightful...|$|E
