5|$|In late July 2006, bus benches {{in several}} Californian cities were {{decorated}} with promotional artwork for Christ Illusion. City officials in Fullerton, California, demanded <b>the</b> <b>artwork</b> be immediately removed from seventeen bus benches located throughout the city, and contacted the hired company which had originally put the adverts {{in place to}} assume the task. The officials disliked the band's name, which they felt referred to a murderer. They also took offense to the antichrist and skull logo adorning the bench artwork. Eventually, <b>the</b> <b>artwork</b> was removed. However, various Orange County, California areas surrounding the city of Fullerton still had benches sporting the cover artwork.|$|E
5|$|June Kim, {{the author}} and {{illustrator}} for 12 Days, primarily drew <b>the</b> <b>artwork</b> in the realism style, although she occasionally rendered characters as super-deformed versions of themselves. While the cover art incorporates red and silver coloring, <b>the</b> <b>artwork</b> primarily appears in black and white, with occasional gray shading. Kim used pen and ink as the artistic medium, then toned her art with the software application ComicStudio. For the narrative, she explores the characters' pasts through dreams, and periodic, nonlinear flashbacks. Several character traits, such as Jackie's chocolate allergy, are presented to the reader through inference rather than exposition. Additionally, Kim uses a brief, untranslated Korean song alongside the predominantly English text.|$|E
