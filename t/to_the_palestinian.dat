5|$|Gaza fell to British forces during World War I, {{becoming}} {{a part of}} Mandatory Palestine.

Gaza was captured by Israel in the Six-Day War in 1967, but in 1993, the city was transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> National Authority. In the months following the 2006 election, an armed conflict broke out between the Palestinian political factions of Fatah and Hamas, resulting in the latter taking power in Gaza. Egypt and Israel consequently imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip. Israel eased the blockade allowing consumer goods in June 2010, and Egypt reopened the Rafah border crossing in 2011 to pedestrians.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Arafat and leading Fatah {{officials}} engaged the Israeli {{government in a}} series of secret talks and negotiations that led to the 1993 Oslo Accords.

The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule. Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, would be transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> interim government.
