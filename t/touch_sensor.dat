500|$|The Retina Display is 1,136 × 640pixels with {{an aspect}} ratio of almost exactly 16:9, (minus one extra row of {{horizontal}} pixels). With a diagonal of 4" [...] {{it has a}} display size of 6.7 square inches, compared to 5.7 in iPhone 4 and 4S. The pixel density remains {{the same as the}} 4S model, which is 326 pixels per inch. Screen icons of the iPhone 5 are arranged in a matrix of six rows of four icons each. The increased screen size allows the sixth row of icons {{to be added to the}} five rows that were present in the iPhone 4. [...] In-cell <b>touch</b> <b>sensor</b> technology from Sharp slims the screen which allows for a thinner phone. The screen's color saturation is 44% greater than its predecessor.|$|E
500|$|The device's [...] LCD has a 1280×800-pixels resolution, {{giving it}} a density of 216 pixels per inch (PPI). Its IPS display enables a wide viewing angle (178°) without {{significant}} color distortion, and enhances color reproduction. The tablet's thin, lightweight form factor was achieved without sacrificing computer power through a special LCD design called Asus TruVivid. The LCD panel uses a [...] "one-glass" [...] solution and a non-traditional lamination technique. Tablet touchscreens typically comprise four pieces of glass—two that sandwich the liquid crystal, a <b>touch</b> <b>sensor</b> glass, and a protective glass—whereas the Asus TruVivid design fuses the protective and sensor glass, with the sensor attached as a film. The conventional lamination technique for touchscreens involves air bonding, in which the glass layers are glued around the edges, leaving air in between; Asus used a [...] "full lamination" [...] technique, in which the glass layers are fused by adhesive with no air between. This yielded thinner display panels, but made production more difficult, as there was less tolerance for imprecision without affecting {{the quality of the}} screen. The tablet's display is protected by a layer of Corning Fit Glass.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{presents}} a novel interface system to aid people {{with visual impairment}} to become proficient with operating unfamiliar devices. The system works by adding <b>touch</b> <b>sensors</b> that trigger audio tags to tactile controls. The <b>touch</b> <b>sensors</b> trigger the audio tags before the control is activated. Design/methodology/approach – The paper describes how several devices were enhanced with the new technology, tested and evaluated. Initial informational interviewing with visually impaired people was followed by user studies with blindfolded but visually able people. A final evaluation of the system was conducted by a visually impaired group. Findings – This paper shows that the technology is of benefit to a visually impaired user when using a complex unfamiliar device. Originality/value – This novel application of <b>touch</b> <b>sensors</b> coupled with audio tags {{has the potential to}} benefit visually impaired people. This technology can easily be incorporated into commercial devices. The idea can also be implemented using off the shelf development boards coupled with smart phones...|$|R

40|$|We {{can touch}} things, and our senses tell us when our hands are {{touching}} something. But most computer input devices cannot detect when the user touches or releases the device or {{some portion of}} the device. Thus, adding <b>touch</b> <b>sensors</b> to computer input devices offers many possibilities for novel input devices and interaction techniques. We demonstrate two new devices, the TouchTrackball and the Scrolling TouchMouse, which use unobtrusive capacitance sensors to detect contact from the user's hand without requiring pressure or mechanical actuation of a switch. We further demonstrate how the capabilities of these devices can be matched to an implicit interaction technique, the OnDemand Interface, which uses the passive information captured by <b>touch</b> <b>sensors</b> to fade in or fade out portions of a display depending on what the user is doing; a second technique uses explicit, intentional interaction with <b>touch</b> <b>sensors</b> for enhanced scrolling. Finally, we discuss the properties of touch-sensing as [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a finger taps {{acceleration}} measurement system for the quantitative diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. The system was composed of two 3 -axis piezoelectric element accelerometers, a pair of <b>touch</b> <b>sensors</b> made of thin stainless steel sheets, an analog-digital (AD) converter and a personal computer (PC). Fingerstalls, with these sensors, were attached to subject’s index finger and thumb. The acceleration and output of the <b>touch</b> <b>sensors</b> were recorded using the PC during the finger taps movements. Intervals between the single finger taps movements were calculated from the measured output of the <b>touch</b> <b>sensors.</b> Velocities during the single finger taps movements were calculated by integrating the measured acceleration. The amplitudes were calculated by integrating the velocities. The standard deviation of the single finger taps intervals, average of maximum single finger taps velocities and average of maximum single finger taps amplitudes were calculated from them. They were used as features for the quantitative diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. The developed system was used to conduct finger taps tests employing 27 normal subjects and 16 Parkinson’s diseases subjects. The subjects were asked to execute continuous finger taps movement for 60 s. It was shown that the acceleration and output of the <b>touch</b> <b>sensors</b> could be measured and the features could be extracted. P I...|$|R
