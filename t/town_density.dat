40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays on the local regulation of housing supply and its influence on house price volatility. I begin by describing the local supply-side dynamics of housing price and stock in each of 47 U. S. metropolitan area housing markets using a unique, market-level panel dataset. The data are analyzed with a conditional vector-autoregression, which characterizes the dynamic responses of price and stock {{to an increase in}} housing demand caused by a shift in employment. These response time-paths are used to create measures of short-, medium- and long-run supply elasticities. Both the time-paths and the implied elasticities vary widely. I use several area characteristics to explain the variation in the supply elasticity measures across metropolitan areas. The results suggest that governments with a greater incentive to regulate housing have a slower house-price response. This directly contradicts the predictions of the existing land-use literature. In order to explain the result, William C. Wheaton and I formalize a general equilibrium theory of a housing market whose local governments determine house price by regulating their supplies of land. The regulatory decisions are made by current residents who already own housing, but the impact of these decisions on prices is determined by new entrants who must purchase housing. The choice of how much to regulate is shown to vary by town size, existing <b>town</b> <b>density,</b> and the amount of open land currently available for development. This is broadly consistent with the results of recent empirical research. (cont.) I also find that the predictions of this theory are directly borne out in data on land-use restrictions across much of Massachusetts. Two types of residential land-use regulation are considered: regulation that restricts the share of land on which housing can be built, and regulation that restricts housing density on a given plot of land. I find evidence suggesting that the two types of regulation may enter the optimization problem of Massachusetts towns very differently, and that towns may regulate new housing more strictly than they did old housing. by Bengte Evenson.

40|$|Under apartheid, black South Africans were {{severely}} {{restricted in}} {{their choice of}} location and many were forced to live in homelands. Following the abolition of apartheid they were free to migrate. Given gravity, a town nearer to the homelands {{can be expected to}} receive a larger inflow of people than a more distant town following the removal of mobility restrictions. Exploting this exogenous variation, we study the effect of migration on urbanisation and the distribution of population. In particular, we test if migration inflows led to displacement, path dependence, or agglomeration in destination areas. We find evidence for path dependence in the aggregate, but substantial heterogeneity across <b>town</b> <b>densities.</b> An exogenous population shock leads to an increase of the urban relative to the rural population, which suggests that exogenous migration shocks can foster urbanisation in the medium run...|$|R
