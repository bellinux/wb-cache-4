5|$|At night, Ellie catches Riley {{attempting}} {{to sneak out}} of the school, and demands to accompany her. Riley reluctantly agrees, and the two make <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mall, where they meet Riley's friend Winston. As Winston teaches Ellie how to ride a horse, Riley steals his radio, and discovers that an attack by the Fireflies—a rebel group opposing the quarantine zone authorities—has occurred nearby. Ellie and Riley make <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attack, and find that the Fireflies are wounded and outnumbered. To help, Ellie and Riley throw smoke grenades at the military, allowing the Fireflies to retreat safely. They are spotted by the military, and escape into a nearby alley, where they narrowly avoid being bitten by an Infected—zombie-like creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus.|$|E

After Beefcake threw David Sammartino out of the ring, Valiant lifted him up and slammed him to the cement floor. He then pushed Sammartino back into the ring before being attacked by Bruno. A short while later, all four men began fighting in the ring, and the match ended in a no-contest.|$|E

5|$|Both {{teams were}} each given 12,000 tickets – the {{remaining}} 6,000 tickets were released, for purchase to the Swedish people. However, Stuttgart {{decided to send}} 11,000 of their 12,000 tickets back to UEFA, due to the German club's supporters finding it difficult to make <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> country, {{as well as the}} absence of air flights available. Subsequently, none of the unsold tickets were granted for Chelsea and its followers; the consequences proved worse, when the side announced that they had issued tickets alone for those, who had ordered the more higher-priced package.|$|E

5|$|Early Tiger IIs proved unreliable, owing principally to leaking {{seals and}} gaskets, and an {{overburdened}} drive train originally intended for a lighter vehicle. The double radius steering gear was initially particularly prone to failure. Lack of crew training could amplify this problem; drivers originally given only limited training on other tanks were often sent directly to operational units already on <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front.|$|E

5|$|Spokane {{became an}} {{important}} rail and shipping center because of its location between mining and farming areas.
