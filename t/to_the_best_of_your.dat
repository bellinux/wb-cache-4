500|$|Stevens' {{teams are}} built around solid {{basketball}} fundamentals and good team work, rather than individual basketball skill. His teams {{are known for}} their defense, forcing opponents into uncharacteristic mistakes. The secret to basketball – and life – is [...] "just to do the job <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> ability and don't worry about anything else," [...] Stevens says. [...] "Win the next game. Win the next possession. That's our focus. It's boring. It's also the way championships are won", he says. In short, Stevens is a strong believer in [...] "The Butler Way" [...] – doing all the little things that transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team. [...] "I tell the players 'the Butler Way' isn't easy to define," [...] Stevens says, [...] "but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball, play with great energy and defend." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Wythe {{served as}} what {{would now be}} called a {{justice of the peace}} in Elizabeth City County during colonial times, his {{reputation}} as the [...] "American Aristides" [...] derived from Wythe's judicial service performed after Virginia became a state, as well as from his scholarship discussed above. The oath Wythe drafted for its admiralty judges indicates his judicial philosophy, [...] "You shall swear that ... you will do equal right to all manner of people, great and small, high and low, rich and poor, according to equity and good conscience, and the laws and usages of Virginia, without respect to persons. ... And, finally, in all things belonging to your said office, during your continuance therein you shall faithfully, justly and truly, according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> skill and judgment, do equal and impartial justice, without fraud, favor or affection, or partiality." [...] Wythe also designed the Chancery Court seal to illustrate the punishment of the Persian judge Sisamnes, killed and skinned after taking a bribe.|$|E
2500|$|A {{central theme}} in Catherine Doherty's spirituality is [...] "the {{duty of the}} moment". As she herself put it:The duty of the moment is what you should be doing at any given time, in {{whatever}} place God has put you. You may not have Christ in a homeless person at your door, but {{you may have a}} little child. If you have a child, your duty of the moment may be to change a dirty diaper. So you do it. But you don't just change that diaper, you change it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> ability, with great love for both God and that child.... There are all kinds of good Catholic things you can do, but whatever they are, {{you have to realize that}} there is always the duty of the moment to be done. And it must be done, because the duty of the moment is the duty of God.|$|E
2500|$|The slogan [...] "Free a Marine to Fight" [...] {{proved to}} be a strong drawing card for the WR, {{stronger}} than any fashioned by the WAC, Waves, or SPARS. Young women were eager to serve in the military during World WarII, often in defiance of their family's wishes. Marian Bauer's parents were so upset when she joined the corps that they did not see her off. Jane Tailor's father, a World War I veteran, gave her this advice: [...] "Don't ever complain to me. You're doing this of your own free will. You weren't drafted or forced. Now, golearn, travel, and do your job <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> ability." [...] And there were those parents who asked special consideration for daughters who were too young to enlist. The minimum age of 20 years, set by law, remained the same throughout the war for the WR. Some parents wondered why 18-year-boys were sent into combat and 18-year-old girls could not even serve. Aside from patriotism, Colonel Streeter was interested to learn the reasons why young women joined the WR. A survey of 1,000 new enlistees was conducted at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, which asked this question. The results of this survey showed that the 750 enlistees had had positive reasons for enlisting. Some had male relatives or friends in the armed forces, and some wanted revenge against the enemy, while others wanted the experience it would bring to their lives. The remaining 250 acknowledged they were trying to escape from something: a bad home life, a broken marriage, boredom, or some personal disappointment. Indications were that Streeter was not displeased with the findings. The WR met its recruitment goal by 1June 1944, and then stopped all recruiting. It began again on 20September 1944, but on a limited basis. The peak strength was 17,640 enlisted and 820 officers.|$|E
