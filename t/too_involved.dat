Later, she {{falls in love}} with another tennis player, , but coach Munakata tells her not to get <b>too</b> <b>involved</b> and that she should forget him and work on her tennis skills. Hiromi often loses confidence in her playing abilities, but with the support of her coach and her friends she overcomes her anxiety. By training herself to become a better player, Hiromi grows into a mentally stronger person. Her enthusiasm, her love of tennis and the support from people around her helps her {{to become one of the}} best players in the world.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from several}} {{memorials}} in Germany, {{after the war}} Litten remained unknown for decades because neither western nor communist governments found him suitable for their cold war propaganda. For the west, Litten had been <b>too</b> <b>involved</b> with communists and for communists, Litten's rejection of Stalinism made him a pariah.|$|E
50|$|Amidst {{all this}} an {{inevitable}} rivalry develops between both Chi-ang and Shi-woo as both, being competitive, constantly strive {{to improve and}} be the best. This, <b>too,</b> <b>involves</b> the pursuing of Soon-deok, with whom both parties are in love with.|$|R

25|$|Floyd {{was elected}} to the Indiana Territorial Legislature in an 1805 special election; the {{legislature}} had been reduced to five members when the Michigan Territory was detached. Floyd was generally at odds {{with the rest of the}} legislature, he was the only anti-slavery representative during his term. By the end of his term he had become <b>too</b> <b>involved</b> in the Aaron Burr Conspiracy to run for re-election and was succeeded by James Beggs as Clark County's representative.|$|E
25|$|Herbert began researching Dune in 1959. He {{was able}} to devote himself wholeheartedly to his writing career because his wife {{returned}} to work full-time as an advertising writer for department stores, becoming the breadwinner during the 1960s. He later told Willis E. McNelly that the novel originated when {{he was supposed to}} do a magazine article on sand dunes in the Oregon Dunes near Florence, Oregon. He became <b>too</b> <b>involved</b> and ended up with far more raw material than needed for an article. The article was never written, but instead planted the seed that led to Dune.|$|E
30|$|We {{report a}} TLH to TAH {{conversion}} rate of 0 % compared to 14 % {{seen in the}} GOG-LAP 2 study [9] probably {{in part due to}} the fact that pelvic lymphadenectomy was not performed in our series. The LACE trial, a randomised multi-centre trial comparing the laparoscopic with the open approach in early stage endometrial cancer, has been started in Australia; however, this <b>too</b> <b>involves</b> lymphadenectomy. Given that lymphadenectomy is not supported by the ASTEC trial [1], our study better reflects current practice in Europe.|$|R

5000|$|This story's plot is {{reminiscent}} of that in [...] "The Red-Headed League", for it, <b>too,</b> <b>involves</b> an elaborate hoax designed to remove an inconvenient person from the scene for a while so that a crime can be committed. The same parallel {{can be seen in}} [...] "The Adventure of the Three Garridebs". However, in contrast to these other two cases, the 'inconvenient person' in this case proves insightful enough to realize {{at least some of the}} deception on his own accord, whereas the other cases see Holmes being brought in to investigate more peripheral matters.|$|R
25|$|Parental involvement, as {{discussed}} in the benefits section {{can also be a}} drawback, if parents and community members are not willing to express their opinions {{on the quality of the}} education system, the system may not see a need for improvement, and not change to meet student’s needs. Parents may also become <b>too</b> <b>involved,</b> requesting too many changes, so that important improvements get lost with other changes that are being suggested. Instructors will also find that their work is increased; they must work to first understand the outcome, then build a curriculum around each outcome they are required to meet. Instructors have found that implementing multiple outcomes is difficult to do equally, especially in primary school. Instructors will also find their work load increased if they chose to use an assessment method that evaluates students holistically.|$|E
25|$|After {{the defeat}} of Saakadze {{and the death of}} Shah Abbas I in 1629, Teimuraz {{proceeded}} to strengthen his authority in eastern Georgia. He instigated Zurab of Aragvi to murder Semayun Khan, an Iranian-appointed rival king of Kartli in 1630, and then had Zurab assassinated, thereby getting rid of them both. By the early 1630s, Teimuraz I had gained more or less stable control of both Kartli and Kakheti. Determined to eliminate the Safavid hegemony over Georgia, Teimuraz sent his ambassador, Niciphores Irbachi, to Western Europe and requested the aid from Philip IV of Spain and Pope Urban VIII. However, the rulers of Europe were <b>too</b> <b>involved</b> in the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) {{to be concerned about the}} fate of a small Caucasian kingdom, and nothing came of this mission, the publication of the first Georgian printed book Dittionario giorgiano e italiano ("Georgian-Italian Dictionary"; Rome, 1629) by Stefano Paolini and Niciphores Irbachi being the only result of this embassy.|$|E

500|$|He {{continued}} to develop local Gabonese politics, in particular revitalizing the Fang clans. In fact, M'ba asserted that Aubame was <b>too</b> <b>involved</b> with the Fang {{to pay attention}} to the interests of the southern tribes, a charge Aubame ridiculed. Aubame was also a leader in solving African problems, particularly developing the Gabonese standard of living and planning urban sites. On 29 September 1951, he voted to increase the minimum wage in the overseas territories of France, and served as vice president of its Commission from 1953 to 1955. He organized the Gabonese Democratic and Social Union (UDSG) in 1947, whose leadership came mostly from the interior, particularly Woleu-Ntem Province. The party in turn backed Aubame's reelection in 1951 and 1956. It had few philosophical differences with the M'ba-led Bloc Démocratique Gabonais (BDG), including advocating less economic dependence on France and faster [...] "Africanization" [...] of French political jobs. Fairly quickly, Gabonese politics became dominated by Aubame, supported by the missions and the administration, and M'ba, supported by the settlers.|$|E
500|$|John A. Logan (18261886) was {{a native}} of Illinois who served as a second {{lieutenant}} in the Mexican–American War before studying at the University of Louisville to become a lawyer. [...] Originally a member of the Democratic Party, he was elected state senator and later a member of the U.S. House of Representatives. [...] During the onset of the Civil War, Logan denounced what he considered extremists on both sides, but eventually volunteered to fight with the Union Army during the First Battle of Bull Run. [...] He then resigned from Congress and was made colonel after he organized the 31st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment. [...] Logan was wounded twice while serving in the war and considered an outstanding field commander. [...] He was promoted to brigadier general following the victory at Fort Donelson. [...] Logan {{played a significant role in}} the Union success at Vicksburg and served as that district's military governor. [...] Following the death of General James B. McPherson, Logan was given command of the Army of the Tennessee, but was soon relieved by General Oliver O. Howard after Logan became <b>too</b> <b>involved</b> with the 1864 presidential election. [...] He left the army in 1865 and resumed his career in politics.|$|E
500|$|Stone Rollin {{received}} widespread acclaim from {{critics and}} was one of the year's best reviewed records. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 86, based on 20 reviews. Writing for AllMusic, Kellman deemed it not just a [...] "period-piece" [...] but also [...] "the high point of Saadiq’s career, his exceptional output with Tony! Toni! Toné! included", while Kevin Ritchie of Now said he exhibited [...] "the electrifying fervour and meticulous musicianship typical of his stage show" [...] on the record. Steve Horowitz from PopMatters wrote that the album [...] "shows off Saadiq's genius as a singer, writer, instrumentalist, and producer of modern rhythm and blues that pays homage to its traditions", adding that it does not have [...] "a false step or even a dull note". In MSN Music, Robert Christgau said Saadiq [...] "plays with himself to beat the band" [...] like Prince and [...] "makes these 10 tracks bump and pulse. And then you notice even the less pneumatic ones connecting as songs." [...] However, he perceived a drop-off from The Way I See It in terms of songwriting and catchiness, singling out [...] "Go to Hell", [...] "Day Dreams", and [...] "Good Man" [...] as the highlights. Slant Magazines Matthew Cole was more critical, finding the record <b>too</b> <b>involved</b> in fabricating retro sensibilities [...] "to leave a lasting impression of its own ... even the highlights are complacent genre exercises".|$|E

50|$|Months {{after the}} battle, the U.S. Navy knew the American public {{had to be}} told something.

To this end, the U.S. Navy provided {{most of the information}} to the publication Popular Mechanics to publish an article on the battle showing the American public that the battle had gone exactly as Halsey had planned. It was several years before the true story of Halsey's decision to leave the San Bernardino Strait unguarded became known to the American public.|$|R

Unfortunately, the attempt did not pan out. Ronstadt later remarked that {{not too many people}} were in control at the time and everyone was <b>too</b> <b>involved</b> with their own careers. (Though the efforts to complete the album were abandoned, a number of the recordings were included on the singers' respective solo recordings over the next few years.)

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} {{research}} {{that is being}} currently undertaken on a significant self-exclusion program for problem gamblers in Australia. With the enormous success of the self-exclusion scheme that has swelled to over 3000 participants, difficulties have been encountered in {{how to deal with}} the relevant issues of identification of potential transgressors. The introduction of modern technology is seen as a possible way of overcoming the difficulties of manual detection, but it <b>too</b> <b>involves</b> its own problems of privacy, cost, legal issues along with technological, workplace and other hurdles that must be overcome. The results of a three-year survey of this special group of gamblers reveal a profile of fascinating insights into their lifestyles and attitudes.
