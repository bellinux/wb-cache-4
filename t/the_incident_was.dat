30|$|The {{prediction}} model must adopt incomplete information because when an <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> reported, {{only part of}} the information on <b>the</b> <b>incident</b> can <b>be</b> obtained for <b>incident</b> duration prediction and even until <b>the</b> <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> cleared. Obtaining all the information that influences <b>the</b> traffic <b>incident</b> duration time <b>is</b> impossible. For example, if no traffic detector <b>is</b> present near <b>the</b> <b>incident</b> location, then obtaining the volume of traffic that passes through <b>the</b> <b>incident</b> location <b>is</b> almost impossible. Thus, <b>the</b> traffic <b>incident</b> duration {{prediction model}} to be developed should have the ability to consider incidents with incomplete information.|$|R
