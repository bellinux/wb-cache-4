5|$|A {{few years}} later there was a debate between Heaviside and Peter Guthrie Tait about the {{relative}} merits of vector analysis and quaternions. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> the realisation that {{there was no need for}} the greater physical insights provided by quaternions if the theory was purely local, and vector analysis became commonplace. Maxwell was proven correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism is considered one of the great accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics.|$|E

5|$|A {{powerful}} Senate Select Committee {{oversaw the}} NCDC and renowned British architect Sir William Holford {{was brought in}} to fine-tune Griffin's original plans. He changed the central basin's geometry so that it was no longer a segment of circle; he converted the southern straight edge into a polygonal shape with three edges and inserted a gulf on the northern shore. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> closer to Scrivener's modified design some decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{started the}} season with a 3–0 win in the Charity Shield against last season's Premier League runners-up Manchester United. Goals came from Overmars in the first half, Christopher Wreh after 61 minutes and Nicolas Anelka 11 minutes after. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> {{the first time that a}} club from Southern England had won the Shield {{outright}} since Tottenham Hotspur in 1962.|$|E
5|$|As {{his second}} {{administration}} began, disaster hit the nation when the Panic of 1893 produced a severe national depression, which Cleveland {{was unable to}} reverse. It ruined his Democratic Party, opening {{the way for a}} Republican landslide in 1894 and for the agrarian and silverite seizure of the Democratic Party in 1896. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> a political realignment that ended the Third Party System and launched the Fourth Party System and the Progressive Era.|$|E

5|$|Autolink, {{the largest}} {{distributor}} of automobiles in Norway, has traditionally bought train services from CargoNet. In 2007, they {{signed a contract}} with Ofotbanen, {{and at the same time}} bought 40% of the company. However, Ofotbanen was in financial difficulties, causing a dispute between the two owners. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> that Autolink formally established Cargolink in March 2008, without the knowledge of Ofotbanen, and terminated the contract with Ofotbanen in July. Cargolink received an operating licence in September and service started in November.|$|E
5|$|Between Operations Trident and Python, and the Indian Air Force {{attacks on}} Karachi's fuel and {{ammunition}} depots, {{more than fifty}} percent of the total fuel requirement of the Karachi zone was reported to have been destroyed. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> a crippling economic blow to Pakistan. The damage was estimated to be worth $3billion, with most of the oil reserves and ammunition warehouses and workshops destroyed. The Pakistan Air Force was also affected by the loss of fuel.|$|E

5|$|By 287 BC, the {{economic}} {{condition of the}} average plebeian had become poor. The problem appears to have centered around widespread indebtedness. The plebeians demanded relief, but the senators refused to address their situation. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> the final plebeian secession. The plebeians seceded to the Janiculum hill. To end the secession, a dictator was appointed. The dictator passed a law (the Lex Hortensia), which ended the requirement that the patrician senators must agree before any bill could be considered by the Plebeian Council. This {{was not the first}} law to require that an act of the Plebeian Council have the full force of law. The Plebeian Council acquired this power during a modification to the original Valerian law in 449 BC. The significance of this law was in the fact that it robbed the patricians of their final weapon over the plebeians. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> that control over the state fell, not onto the shoulders of voters, but to the new plebeian nobility.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1850s it {{was clear}} that France was unable to match British {{building}} of steam warships, and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> the first ocean-going ironclad, , begun in 1857 and launched in 1859.|$|E
5|$|Dazzle {{was adopted}} by the Admiralty in the UK, and then by the United States Navy, with little evaluation. Each ship's dazzle pattern was unique to avoid making classes of ships {{instantly}} recognisable to the enemy. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> that a profusion of dazzle schemes was tried, and the evidence for their success was at best mixed. So many factors were involved {{that it was impossible to}} determine which were important, and whether any of the colour schemes were effective.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{most common}} <b>result</b> of an {{overflow}} {{is that the}} least significant representable bits of <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>are</b> stored; <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>is</b> said to wrap around the maximum (i.e. modulo power of two).|$|R

5|$|He is {{credited}} with popularising a technical innovation in the printing of illustrations using wood. He adopted metal-engraving tools to cut hard boxwood across the grain, producing printing blocks that could be integrated with metal type, but were much more durable than traditional woodcuts. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> high-quality illustration at a low price.|$|E
5|$|Improvement {{continued}} in the nineteenth century. Innovations included the first working reaping machine, developed by Patrick Bell in 1828. His rival James Smith turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without disturbing the topsoil. Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production and <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> the even Lowland landscape that still predominates.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, Congress {{passed a}} {{resolution}} authorizing President George Washington to establish a mint. Feeling that the resolution was inadequate, President Washington asked legislators to pass a comprehensive law which would govern the new facility. <b>The</b> <b>result</b> <b>was</b> the Mint Act of 1792, which prescribed the specifications of the new US coins, the highest denomination being the eagle, or ten-dollar piece.|$|E
