5|$|Overall, the Army's wartime {{division}} {{organization and}} reorganizations have been judged a success by historians, {{in that they}} provided an adequate number of units <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> while ensuring that agricultural and industrial production could continue.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, {{criticism}} {{over the}} Johnson Administration's {{handling of the}} Vietnam War began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the 1966 midterm elections saw a 47-seat swing {{in favor of the}} Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon, expecting <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> delayed {{too long}} and lost this opportunity; by December the Allies had {{withdrawn}} the offer. When his back was to the wall in 1814 he tried to reopen peace negotiations {{on the basis of}} accepting the Frankfurt proposals. The Allies now had new, harsher terms that included the retreat of France to its 1791 boundaries, which meant the loss of Belgium. Napoleon would remain Emperor, however he rejected the term. The British wanted Napoleon permanently removed; they prevailed. Napoleon adamantly refused.|$|E

5|$|Nuclear {{weapons were}} {{developed}} during World War II by the wartime Manhattan Project. Key scientists {{working on the}} project anticipated that their development would have wide-ranging implications. However the project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., was reluctant to spend project funds on activities beyond those required <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Nonetheless, Arthur Compton of the Metallurgical Project in Chicago commissioned a report on post-war nuclear energy, and the Military Policy Committee, the Manhattan Project's governing body, commissioned a similar study by Richard Tolman. Both reports called for a comprehensive, government-supported nuclear energy program, with military, scientific, and industrial aspects.|$|E
5|$|Winfield Scott, the {{commanding}} {{general of the}} U.S. Army {{at the beginning of}} the war, devised the Anaconda Plan <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> with as little bloodshed as possible. His idea was that a Union blockade of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy; then the capture of the Mississippi River would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan in terms of a blockade to squeeze to death the Confederate economy, but overruled Scott's warnings that his new army was not ready for an offensive operation because public opinion demanded an immediate attack.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1975, members of the North Vietnamese Political Bureau paid {{close attention to the}} military situation in South Vietnam to plan for their next major offensive. On January 8, two days after the Vietnam People’s Army 4th Corps had captured Phuoc Long on the northern edges of South Vietnam’s III Corps Tactical Zone, North Vietnamese leaders agreed to launch an all-out military offensive, in order <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Originally the North Vietnamese leaders expected the campaign would last two years, be completed in 1976, and pave the way for final victory. Their key objectives were to bring military pressure closer to Saigon, annihilate as many South Vietnamese military units as possible, and create favourable conditions on the battlefield so that combat forces could be deployed from their current localities.|$|E

The Decepticons, however, remain the main antagonists, with whom the Autobots have been warring for quite some time.

5|$|In December 1971, {{following}} {{the defeat of}} South Vietnamese forces during Operation Lam Son 719, North Vietnamese leadership in Hanoi decided to launch a major military offensive against South Vietnam. In {{what became known as}} the Easter Offensive, the combined North Vietnamese and Việt Cộng forces employed combined arms tactics using heavy weapons that were a radical departure from the low-intensity guerrilla warfare of previous years. Although North Vietnam eventually used the equivalent of 14 army divisions, its leaders did not seek <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> outright. Rather, their objective was to gain as much territory and destroy as many units of the South Vietnamese military as possible, in order to strengthen their bargaining position at the Paris Peace Talks.|$|E
5|$|The last-ditched {{effort by}} the Germans <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> came to a {{grinding}} halt in mid-July and after that there followed {{a brief period of}} lull, during which time the Australians undertook a series of small unit actions aimed at capturing parts of the German line with limited support. These actions became known as Peaceful Penetrations and were essentially a cross between trench raids and patrolling. Their success relied heavily upon the leadership and initiative of junior commanders and the ability of soldiers to employ principles of fire and manouevre. This lull did not last long, however, as the Allies were soon ready to launch their own offensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, which would ultimately bring about an end to the war.|$|E
5|$|During the English Civil War, {{the members}} of the Long Parliament {{realised}} that the use of county militia organised into regional associations (such as the Eastern Association), often commanded by local members of parliament (both from the House of Commons and the House of Lords), while more than able to hold their own in the regions which Parliamentarians controlled, were unlikely <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> So Parliament initiated two actions. The Self-denying Ordinance, with the notable exception of Oliver Cromwell, forbade members of parliament from serving as officers in the Parliamentary armies. This created a distinction between the civilians in Parliament, who tended to be Presbyterian and conciliatory to the Royalists in nature, and a corps of professional officers, who tended to Independent politics, to whom they reported. The second action was legislation {{for the creation of a}} Parliamentary-funded army, commanded by Lord General Thomas Fairfax, which became known as the New Model Army (originally new-modelled Army).|$|E

5|$|Harclay's {{head was}} on display in London for five years before it was taken down. His sister {{petition}}ed the king to return the {{various parts of the}} body for a Christian burial, and in 1328 her request was granted. Further clemencies were not awarded. In the reign of Edward III, Harclay's nephew Henry petitioned to have the charge of treason annulled, but the petition was ignored. As for the peace treaty, the wisdom of Harclay's policy was vindicated after his death. Edward II's inability <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> against the Scots, combined with his refusal to give up his claim on the Scottish crown, proved untenable in the end. Furthermore, it was Harclay's military skills and well-organised forces that gave what little protection the northern borders had over the previous years. Less than three months after Harclay's execution, Edward agreed on a thirteen-year truce with Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In early 346 BC, Philip let it {{be known}} that he {{intended}} to march south with the Thessalians, though not where or why. The Phocians thus made plans to defend Thermopylae, and requested assistance from the Spartans and the Athenians, probably around the 14th of February. The Spartans dispatched Archidamos III with 1000 hoplites, and the Athenians ordered everyone eligible for military service under the age of 40 to be sent to the Phocians' aid. However, between the Phocians' appeal and the end of the month, all plans were upset by the return of Phalaikos to power in Phocis; the Athenians and the Spartans were subsequently told that they would not be permitted to defend Thermopylae. It is not clear from the ancient sources why Phalaikos was returned to power, nor why he adopted this dramatic change of policy. Cawkwell suggests, based on remarks of Aeschines that the Phocian army restored Phalaikos because they had not been properly paid, and further that Phalaikos, realizing that the army could not be paid and that the Phocians could no longer hope <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> decided to try to negotiate a peace settlement with Philip.|$|E
5|$|Though uninvolved {{in foreign}} affairs, and {{therefore}} obliged to follow Britain's lead, the colony enthusiastically supported the mother country during the Second World War, symbolically affirming the British {{declaration of war}} before {{any other part of}} the Empire. During the ensuing conflict over 26,100 Southern Rhodesians of all races served in the armed forces, pro rata to white population a higher contribution of manpower than any other British colony or dominion, and more than the UK itself. George VI knighted Huggins in 1941, and, with the war still ongoing, Britain made overtures towards dominion status. Huggins dismissed this, saying it was imperative <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> first. The idea of dominionship was raised again in 1952, but Salisbury once more did not pursue it, instead following the results of a referendum held early the next April to enter an initially semi-independent Federation with the directly administered British colonies of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.|$|E

Although Castiel learns that his stolen grace will kill him eventually, he refuses Metatron's offer to side with him, eventually convincing Gadreel to ally with him in opposing Metatron's attempt to stage a coup of Heaven even as Metatron tricks the other angels into follow him by presenting Castiel as a despot willing to destroy everything <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> convincing angels to 'suicide bomb' themselves and claim that Castiel told them to do it.

50|$|Franco {{personally}} guided {{military operations}} {{from this time}} {{until the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> After <b>the</b> failed assault on Madrid in November 1936, Franco settled on a piecemeal approach <b>to</b> <b>winning</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> rather than bold maneuvering. As with his decision to relieve the garrison at Toledo, this approach has been subject of some debate; some of his decisions, such as in June 1938 when he preferred to head for Valencia instead of Catalonia, remain particularly controversial from a military viewpoint. However, Valencia, Castellon and Alicante saw the last Republican troops defeated by Franco.|$|R
