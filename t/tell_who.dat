When the {{ceremony}} ends, Devu welcomes {{the father of}} the bride: Sanjana's father. Yogesh is stunned when his grandfather brings the money to pay Jitu's debts. He asks Devu how he arranged the marriage; Devu explains that when Sanjana followed him and showed him a picture of her boyfriend, he remembered seeing the boyfriend kissing another woman in Khandala. He brought Sanjana to a hotel in Khandala to confront her boyfriend. Sanjana told him she would marry Yogesh, having realised that she loves him. The film ends with the marriage attendants asking Sanjana's astrological sign. Sanjana asks Yogesh what her raashee is, to which he says he does not know, and smiles.|$|E

25|$|There was an adage amongst Westerners {{that one}} could easily <b>tell</b> <b>who</b> was a real female and who was not – the transvestites were drop-dead gorgeous, while the rest were real women.

She is powerful and strong in her ways and {{would do anything to}} keep the Tong family running smoothly with smiles on their faces. She foresees Kam's plotting antics and thus she kicks her out. During her declining health and final days of life, she spent them with her family in a happy manner. Even on her death bed, she was very straightforward in her act of not letting Kam back into her family.|$|E
25|$|Early in the 20th century polio {{would become}} the world's most feared disease. The disease hit without warning, tended to strike white, {{affluent}} individuals, required long quarantine periods during which parents were separated from children: {{it was impossible to}} <b>tell</b> <b>who</b> would get the disease and who would be spared. The consequences of the disease left polio victims marked for life, leaving behind vivid images of wheelchairs, crutches, leg braces, breathing devices, and deformed limbs. However, polio changed not only the lives of those who survived it, but also affected profound cultural changes: the emergence of grassroots fund-raising campaigns that would revolutionize medical philanthropy, the rise of rehabilitation therapy and, through campaigns for the social and civil rights of the disabled, polio survivors helped to spur the modern disability rights movement.|$|E

500|$|In {{their writing}} Wellek and Warren {{attempted}} {{to present a}} single voice despite the dominance of individuals. Their success in presenting such a voice has been debated. Wellek later recalled that people often {{told him it was}} difficult to <b>tell</b> <b>who</b> had written which chapter without consulting the book's introduction. However, the literary scholar C. J. van Rees of Tilburg University notes that Wellek's influences are prevalent in chapters authored by Warren. Aldo Scaglione, in a review of the second edition, wrote that [...] "one immediately senses the change of hand" [...] between chapters by different authors.|$|E
500|$|These fights {{were usually}} {{close-up}} and personal, {{with a number}} of shots blasted from pistols, often resulting in innocent bystanders hit by bullets gone wild. Much of the time, {{it would be difficult to}} <b>tell</b> <b>who</b> had [...] "won” the gunfight for several minutes, as the black powder smoke from the pistols cleared the air. How famous gunfighters died is as varied as each man. Many well-known gunfighters were so feared by the public because of their reputation that when they were killed, they died as a result of ambush rather than going down in a [...] "blaze of glory". Others died secluded deaths either from old age or illness.|$|E
500|$|On 28 November 2006, {{both men}} were sentenced to life imprisonment. The minimum termed for Carty was fixed at 21 years, and that for 18-year-old Brown at 17 years.

Both sentences were referred to the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) as [...] "unduly lenient" [...] by Her Majesty's Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith QC. That court, constituted by the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, Mr Justice Henriques and Mr Justice Teare, increased Brown's minimum term to 20 years, although it did not interfere with the sentence imposed upon Carty.|$|E

500|$|Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp, {{along with}} {{temporary}} federal deputies Wyatt and Morgan Earp, Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams, former Kansas Sheriff Bat Masterson (who was dealing faro at the Oriental Saloon), and County Sheriff Behan {{set out to}} find the robbers. Wells Fargo issued a wanted poster offering a US$3,600 ($1,200 per robber) reward for capture of the robbers, dead or alive. Robbery of a mail-carrying stagecoach was both a federal crime and territorial crime, and the posse consisted of both county and federal authorities and deputies. The posse trailed the robbers to a nearby ranch where they found a drifter named Luther King. He wouldn't <b>tell</b> <b>who</b> his confederates were until the posse lied and told him that Doc Holliday's girlfriend had been shot. Fearful of Holliday's reputation, he confessed to holding the reins of the robbers' horses, and identified Bill Leonard, Harry [...] "The Kid" [...] Head and Jim Crane as the robbers. They were all known Cowboys and rustlers. Behan and Williams escorted King back to Tombstone.|$|E
500|$|Members of both ZANLA and ZIPRA had deserted their {{positions}} {{and engaged in}} banditry. In Matabeleland, ZIPRA deserters who {{came to be known}} as [...] "dissenters" [...] engaged in robbery, holding up buses, and attacking farm houses, creating an environment of growing lawlessness. These dissidents received support from South Africa through its Operation Mute, by which it hoped to further destabilise Zimbabwe. The government often conflated ZIPRA with the dissenters, although Nkomo denounced the dissidents and their South African supporters. Mugabe authorised the police and army to crack down on the Matabeleland dissenters, declaring that state officers would be granted legal immunity for any [...] "extra-legal" [...] actions they may perform while doing so. During 1982 he had established the Fifth Brigade, an elite armed force trained by the North Koreans; membership was drawn largely from Shona-speaking ZANLA soldiers and were answerable directly to Mugabe. In January 1983, the Fifth Brigade were deployed in the region, overseeing a campaign of beatings, arson, public executions, and massacres of those accused of being sympathetic to the dissidents. The scale of the violence was greater than that witnessed in the Rhodesian War. Interrogation centres were established where people were tortured. Mugabe acknowledged that civilians would be persecuted in the violence, claiming that [...] "we can't <b>tell</b> <b>who</b> is a dissident and who is not". The ensuing events became known as the [...] "Gukurahundi", a Shona word meaning [...] "wind that sweeps away the chaff before the rains".|$|E
