5|$|Apple {{claims that}} the battery for both generations of iPad can provide up to 10 hours of video, 140 hours of audio playback, or one month on standby. Like any {{rechargeable}} battery technology, the iPad's battery loses capacity over time, but is not designed to be user-replaceable. In a program similar to the battery-replacement program for <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> and the original iPhone, Apple will replace an iPad that does not hold an electrical charge with a refurbished iPad for a fee of US$99 plus $6.95 shipping. As a different unit is supplied, user data is not preserved. The refurbished unit {{will have a new}} case. The warranty on the refurbished unit may vary between jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|Sonic the Hedgehog {{has been}} {{available}} for all three major seventh-generation video game consoles. It {{was part of the}} Wii Virtual Console at the service's 2006 introduction, and was released for the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network shortly afterwards. The game was released for <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Classic, iPod video, and video-capable iPod Nano models in 2007 and for Apple's iOS in April 2009. Sonic the Hedgehog became available on GameTap in September 2009. In October 2010, it was released on Microsoft Windows via Steam. The game was ported to Android and released in December 2012. Additionally, the game is an unlockable reward in the console versions of Sonic Generations. The game was also made available on the Sega Forever service on iOS and Android in June 2017.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> {{fifth-generation}} <b>iPod</b> is <b>the</b> first <b>iPod</b> to {{be available}} in an alternative color scheme in a non-special-edition form, as a black option was added alongside [...] "Signature iPod White", and marked the second full redesign of <b>the</b> <b>iPod's</b> aesthetic with its re-arranged proportions, its return to a fully flat front plate, and its more rounded rear casing. The 4-pin remote port was removed as well, causing backwards compatibility issues with certain accessories. A 30GB model was offered for US$299 and a 60GB model was offered for US$399. <b>The</b> fifth-generation <b>iPod</b> was also offered in the U2 special edition for US$349 with 30 GB. <b>The</b> fifth-generation <b>iPod</b> was <b>the</b> last model to have a plastic face.|$|R
25|$|On <b>the</b> second {{generation}} <b>iPod</b> Shuffle, USB connectivity is provided via an included {{piece of hardware}} which acts as a docking station for the transfer of data and the recharging of <b>the</b> <b>iPod's</b> internal battery through its headphone jack. <b>The</b> {{second generation}} <b>iPod</b> Shuffle was also able {{to act as a}} flash drive, just like <b>the</b> first generation <b>iPod</b> Shuffle. However, unlike <b>the</b> first generation <b>iPod</b> Shuffle, <b>the</b> second generation did not have a built-in USB connector. This means that the docking station was required for connection to a computer.|$|R
5|$|The iPad 2 {{supports}} iOS 8 {{which was}} released on September 17, 2014, making it the first iOS device to support 5 major versions of iOS (including iOS 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). While the device is still supported, {{most of the new}} features of the software are not supported due to relatively aged hardware and therefore, is limited in terms of performance. Users have also reported numerous problems after receiving the update including the accessibility features and battery-related issues. Many users predicted that the iPad 2 was going to be dropped from updating to iOS 8 along with the iPhone 4, the same process that happened with the iPhone 3GS and <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Touch (fourth generation) and earlier models, considering that it has been supported for more than 3 years.|$|E
25|$|Apple's {{release of}} <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Nano as a {{replacement}} for <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Mini was viewed by many as a risky move. Steve Jobs argued that <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Nano was a necessary risk since competitors were beginning to catch up to <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Mini in terms of design and features, and believed <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Nano would prove to be even more popular and successful than <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Mini.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>iPod</b> Nano (stylized {{and marketed}} as iPod nano) is a {{portable}} media player designed and marketed by Apple Inc. The first generation model was introduced on September 7, 2005, {{as a replacement}} for <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Mini, using flash memory for storage. <b>The</b> <b>iPod</b> Nano went through several differing models, or generations, since its introduction. Apple discontinued <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Nano on July 27, 2017.|$|E

25|$|On July 27, 2017, Apple removed <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Nano and Shuffle {{from its}} stores, marking {{the end of}} Apple {{producing}} standalone music players. Currently, <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Touch is the only iPod produced by Apple.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> third-generation <b>iPod</b> had a weak bass response, {{as shown}} in audio tests. The {{combination}} of the undersized DC-blocking capacitors and the typical low impedance of most consumer headphones form a high-pass filter, which attenuates the low-frequency bass output. Similar capacitors were used in <b>the</b> fourth-generation <b>iPods.</b> <b>The</b> problem is reduced when using high-impedance headphones and is completely masked when driving high-impedance (line level) loads, such as an external headphone amplifier. <b>The</b> first-generation <b>iPod</b> Shuffle uses a dual-transistor output stage, rather than a single capacitor-coupled output, and does not exhibit reduced bass response for any load.|$|R
25|$|It {{originally}} retailed for $149.99, but a $50 coupon {{was included}} with the U2 Special Edition <b>iPods</b> from <b>the</b> fourth-generation <b>iPod.</b> <b>The</b> video-capable U2 <b>iPods</b> included a code for a 33-minute video of live band performances and interviews. As of 20 December 2007, the set is no longer available for sale.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>iPod</b> Shuffle was {{announced}} {{at the same time}} as the Mac Mini. Like <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Shuffle, the Mac Mini is a scaled-down product which has been introduced at a lower price. These two products together can be seen as a conscious effort on the part of Apple management to target a lower-end market and increase visibility in the mass-market. Previously, the success of Apple's iPod and especially <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Mini had been chipping away at the inexpensive flash player market, causing flash players at the beginning of 2005 to account for less than half the market share they did in 2004. However, the original and Mini iPods were expensive and the Shuffle was intended to make <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> compete with mainstream players.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{unsupported}} third-party applications {{have been created}} to assist synchronization of songs with any music player that can be mounted as an external drive. Though iTunes is the only official method for synchronizing with <b>the</b> <b>iPod,</b> there are other applications available that allow <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> to sync with other software players.|$|E
25|$|By April 2005, {{the end of}} Apple's second fiscal quarter, <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Shuffle {{had already}} proven itself to be a {{successful}} product for its manufacturer. Although Apple has chosen not to specify how many iPod Shuffles were sold in the product's first three months of existence, analysts at Piper Jaffray estimated that 1.8million of the 5.3million iPods sold in the second quarter were Shuffles. NPD Group estimates that <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Shuffle captured 43% of the flash-based music player market in February 2005, after only its second month of existence. By March 2005 <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Shuffle's market share had risen to 58%.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the 1st-generation iPhone in 2007, Apple has used Helvetica in its software design. iOS for <b>the</b> iPhone, <b>iPod</b> touch, iPad, and Apple TV employs the font, alongside its use on <b>iPods</b> beginning with <b>the</b> 6th-generation <b>iPod</b> classic and 3rd-generation iPod nano.|$|R

They also ship with <b>the</b> {{fifth-generation}} <b>iPod</b> touch (without mic) and <b>the</b> seventh-generation <b>iPod</b> nano (without mic). They're also sold independently. The Apple EarPods are assembled in Vietnam.|$|R
25|$|Besides {{earning a}} {{reputation}} as a respected entertainment device, <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> has also been accepted as a business device. Government departments, major institutions and international organisations have turned to <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> line as a delivery mechanism for business communication and training, such as the Royal and Western Infirmaries in Glasgow, Scotland, where iPods are used to train new staff.|$|E
25|$|Many {{accessories}} {{have been}} made for <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> line. A large number are made by third party companies, although many, such as <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Hi-Fi, are made by Apple. Some accessories add extra features that other music players have, such as sound recorders, FM radio tuners, wired remote controls, and audio/visual cables for TV connections. Other accessories offer unique features like the Nike+iPod pedometer and <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Camera Connector. Other notable accessories include external speakers, wireless remote controls, protective case, screen films, and wireless earphones. Among the first accessory manufacturers were Griffin Technology, Belkin, JBL, Bose, Monster Cable, and SendStation.|$|E
25|$|On January 30, 2007, Apple {{announced}} {{the addition of}} four new colors to <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Shuffle line - pink, orange, green, and blue, {{in addition to the}} original silver color. The orange color was a first for <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> franchise. They also now came with new redesigned headphones that were not included with the original silver model. The box was also changed to have gray text instead of the lime-green text. On September 5, 2007, Apple introduced four new colors, including a Product Red version. The new colors were turquoise, lavender, mint green, and Product Red, with the previous colors discontinued. On February 19, 2008, Apple introduced a 2GB version of <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Shuffle, retailing for US$69 and available in all the same colours as the 1GB model. At the Apple Let's Rock Event on September 9, 2008, Apple once again released four new colors for <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Shuffle: blue, green, pink, and red, replacing the colors that were released in September 2007. The new blue, green and pink variants of <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Shuffle reverted to shades that were similar to the colors that were released in January 2007. In June 2009, Avon offered a gold iPod Shuffle (second generation) for $29 when purchased in conjunction with two ANEW skin care products.|$|E
50|$|The biggest {{competition}} for MiniDisc {{came from the}} emergence of MP3 players. With the Diamond Rio player in 1998 and <b>the</b> Apple <b>iPod,</b> <b>the</b> mass market began to eschew physical media in favor of file-based systems.|$|R

25|$|The {{front of}} <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Shuffle had buttons for Play/Pause, Next Song/Fast Forward, Previous Song/Fast Reverse, {{and up and}} down volume adjustment. On the reverse, it had a battery level {{indicator}} light (activated by a button) and a three-position switch to turn the unit off or set it to play music in order or shuffled. It plugged directly into a computer's USB port (either 1.1 or 2.0), through which it also recharged its battery, which has an expected life of around 12 hours. The USB plug is hidden beneath a cap. The unit also comes with a lanyard that attaches to <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Shuffle via an attached cap and this allows the user to wear <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> Shuffle around his or her neck.|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{synchronization}} can {{be turned}} off in favor of manually copying individual songs or complete playlists. iTunes supports copying music to an iPod; however, only music and videos purchased from the iTunes Store can be transferred from <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> back to iTunes. This functionality was added after third-party software was written which allowed users to copy all content back to their computer. It is also possible to copy from <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> using ordinary Unix command line tools, or by enabling hidden file viewing in Windows Explorer, then copying music from <b>the</b> <b>iPod</b> drive to a local disk for backup. Doing this can be confusing because the files are arranged {{in such a way}} that their folders and (depending on iPod and iTunes versions) file names are seemingly picked at random as they are put on <b>the</b> <b>iPod.</b> It is worth noting, however, that the files (along with their embedded title and artist information) remain unchanged. It is therefore less confusing to let iTunes reimport, reorganize, and rename all of the files after they are backed up.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>iPod</b> Shuffle (stylized {{and marketed}} as iPod shuffle) is a digital audio player {{designed}} and marketed by Apple Inc. It was the smallest model in Apple's iPod family, {{and was the}} first iPod to use flash memory. The first model was announced at the Macworld Conference & Expo on January 11, 2005; the last fourth generation model was introduced on September 1, 2010. <b>The</b> <b>iPod</b> Shuffle was discontinued by Apple on July 27, 2017.|$|E
25|$|The third {{generation}} began including a 30-pin dock connector, allowing for FireWire or USB connectivity. This provided better compatibility with non-Apple machines, {{as most of}} them did not have FireWire ports at the time. Eventually Apple began shipping iPods with USB cables instead of FireWire, although the latter was available separately. As of <b>the</b> first-generation <b>iPod</b> Nano and <b>the</b> fifth-generation <b>iPod</b> Classic, Apple discontinued using FireWire for data transfer (while still allowing for use of FireWire to charge the device) {{in an attempt to}} reduce cost and form factor. As of <b>the</b> second-generation <b>iPod</b> Touch and <b>the</b> fourth-generation <b>iPod</b> Nano, FireWire charging ability has been removed. The second-, third-, and fourth-generation iPod Shuffle uses a single 3.5mm minijack phone connector which acts as both a headphone jack or a USB data and charging port for the dock/cable.|$|R
50|$|Notably, <b>the</b> second-generation <b>iPods</b> and <b>the</b> updated first-generation <b>iPod</b> {{were now}} Windows-compatible. These {{versions}} {{came with a}} 4-pin to 6-pin FireWire adapter and were bundled with Musicmatch Jukebox. At that time iTunes was Mac only and unavailable for Windows.|$|R
