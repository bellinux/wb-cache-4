However, faced with other enemy battles, he abstained from attacking and put his men in a defensive position on a hill. He lighted big fires and played the <b>trumpets</b> to <b>guide</b> all the Portuguese spread throughout the camp towards him and to defy the enemy.He acted this way because, according to the chronicler √Ålvaro Chaves, the Princes forces were under-numbered as most of his men had gone {{in pursuit of the}} adversaries: [...] "(...) [...] turned against the battles of king D. Ferdinand, but because the people from his battles spread in the pursue of the defeated, the enemys battle outnumbered the few men that remained with him, but in spite of that he attacked and defeated it and he went on until he faced other enemy battles, and then he stopped his battle to recover some of his dispersed men (...) because the enemy had the triple of his people." ...|$|R
5000|$|A fake {{book is a}} {{collection}} of jazz songs and tunes with just the basic elements of the music provided. There are two types of fake books: collections of lead sheets, which include the melody, chords, and lyrics (if present); and collections of songs and tunes with only the chords. Fake books that contain only the chords are used by rhythm section performers (notably chord-playing musicians such as electric guitarists and piano players and the bassist) to help guide their improvisation of accompaniment parts for the song. Fake books with only the chords can also be used by [...] "lead instruments" [...] (e.g., saxophone or <b>trumpet)</b> as a <b>guide</b> to their improvised solo performances. Since the melody is not included in chord-only fake books, lead instrument players are expected to know the melody.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} was to test the focusing properties of {{a new type of}} focusing neutron <b>guide</b> <b>trumpet</b> with parabolically shaped walls. The guide has a length of 431 mm with an entrance area of 16 x 16 mm 2 and an output area of 4 x 4 mm 2. The interior surfaces were coated with a supermirror surface m 3 and due to their parabolic shape it was expected that an incident parallel beam can be focused in {{the focal point of the}} parabolas. To prove this statement the neutron intensity distribution at different distances behind the guide was recorded by means of a standard, high resolution radiography detector. The experiments were performed at the V 12 b instrument at HMI with different levels of beam monochromatization demonstrating maximum intensity gains of about 25. The consideration for using the focusing guide for the purposes of cold neutron radiography will be presente...|$|R
5000|$|Reviewers {{were deeply}} divided in their {{reactions}} to the [...] "classic" [...] period of Renaissance, and their style of music. Some critics saw little value in their music, like Wayne King's entry in The new Rolling Stone record guide describing the period 1974 to 1983:"Their inability to compose songs that would allow for any fluidity or improvisation" [...] meant that [...] "Renaissance's appeal, nonexistent in their native England and cultish at best in America, declined ... and {{the remainder of the}} Sire material matches this commercial decline with an artistic one. The comeback attempt on IRS ... was a ludicrous failure."Progressive rock reviewers were much more supportive, such as Charles Snider in The Strawberry <b>Bricks</b> <b>Guide</b> to Progressive Rock evaluating the album Scheherazade and Other Stories, who describes:"Annie Haslam's crystal clear five-octave voice high in the mix, supported by the virtuoso talents of pianist John Tout and Jon Camp's distinctive Rickenbacker bass, and orchestral arrangements by Tony Cox." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{painting}} Louis XIII Comes of Age {{represents the}} historical {{scene of the}} transferring of power from mother to son in abstract, or allegorical means. Marie has reigned as regent during her son's youth, and now she has handed the rudder of the ship to Louis, the new king of France. The ship represents the state, now in operation as Louis steers the vessel. Each of the rowers can be identified by the emblematic shields that hang {{on the side of}} the ship. The second rower's shield depicts a flaming altar with four sphinxes, a coiling serpent and an open eye that looks downwards. These characteristics are known to be that of Piety or Religion, both of which Maria would want her son to embody. What is also known as a parade boat, Rubens referencing Horace's boat, is adorned with a dragon on front and dolphins on the stern. Louis looks upwards to his mother for guidance on how to steer the ship of state. In the violent clouds are two Fames, one with a Roman buccina and the second with what seems to be a <b>trumpet.</b> Louis <b>guides,</b> while the ship's actual movement is due to the four rowing figures, personifying Force, Religion, Justice, and Concord. The figure adjusting the sail is thought to be Prudence or Temperance. At the center in front of the mast stands France, with a flame in her right hand illustrating steadfastness and the globe of the realm, or the orb of government, in her left. Force, extending her oar and heaving to, is identified by the shield just beneath her showing a lion and column. She is paired with Marie by the color of their hair, and similarly Louis is paired with Religion, or the Order of the Holy Spirit.|$|R
2500|$|In retrospect, {{many critics}} {{consider}} the album to be a classic {{of the progressive}} rock genre as well as Hansson's best work. In addition, {{it can be seen}} as an early example of multi-instrumentalist rock, predating similar 1970s albums by artists such as Mike Oldfield, Rick Wakeman, and Brian Eno. In his book The Billboard Guide to Progressive Music, author Bradley Smith has described the album as [...] "an early classic of space music" [...] and Bruce Eder, writing for the Allmusic website, has called it [...] "one of the few progressive rock instrumental recordings that still holds up on repeated listening." [...] In addition, author Charles Snider has noted in The Strawberry <b>Bricks</b> <b>Guide</b> to Progressive Rock that the album's [...] "quiet yet sinister organ tones are more similar to Pink Floyd than anything fairy tale-like or electronic". In his review for the Dutch Progressive Rock website, Nigel Camilleri also likened the album to early Pink Floyd but was critical of its overall lack of variety and outdated keyboard and synthesizer sounds.|$|R

She is paired with Marie by the color of their hair, and similarly Louis is paired with Religion, or the Order of the Holy Spirit.The pairing of Marie with the figure of Force gives power to the image of the queen, while Marie's actual pose is more passive, showing very effectively her graceful acknowledgement of her son's authority henceforth. [...] It is an interesting painting to examine within the context of the tense relationship between the young king and his mother. Marie had clung to power past the end of her regency, until Louis seized power in 1617 and exiled her to Blois. Rubens obviously would have known this and so chose to ignore the tension surrounding Marie's relationship with her son, instead emphasizing her poise in the transfer of power.|$|R
60|$|The Clay Pounds are a more fertile tract than usual. We {{saw some}} fine patches of roots and corn here. As {{generally}} on the Cape, the plants had little stalk or leaf, but ran remarkably to seed. The corn was {{hardly more than}} half as high as in the interior, yet the ears were large and full, and one farmer {{told us that he}} could raise forty bushels on an acre without manure, and sixty with it. The heads of the rye also were remarkably large. The Shadbush (Amelanchier), Beach Plums, and Blueberries (Vaccinium Pennsylvanicum), like the apple-trees and oaks, were very dwarfish, spreading over the sand, {{but at the same time}} very fruitful. The blueberry was but an inch or two high, and its fruit often rested on the ground, so that you did not suspect the presence of the bushes, even on those bare hills, until you were treading on them. I thought that this fertility must be owing mainly to the abundance of moisture in the atmosphere, for I observed that what little grass there was was remarkably laden with dew in the morning, and in summer dense imprisoning fogs frequently last till midday, turning one's beard into a wet napkin about his throat, and the oldest inhabitant may lose his way within a stone's throw of his house or be obliged to follow the beach for a <b>guide.</b> The <b>brick</b> house attached to the light-house was exceedingly damp at that season, and, writing-paper lost all its stiffness in it. It was impossible to dry your towel after bathing, or to press flowers without their mildewing. The air was so moist that we rarely wished to drink, though we could at all times taste the salt on our lips. Salt was rarely used at table, and our host told us that his cattle invariably refused it when it was offered them, they got so much with their grass and at every breath, but he said that a sick horse or one just from the country would sometimes take a hearty draught of salt water, and seemed to like it and be the better for it.|$|R
