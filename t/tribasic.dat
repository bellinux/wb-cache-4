50|$|Current {{practices}} of managing olive peacock spot disease aim to have consistent suppression {{by keeping the}} levels of inoculum low and through preventative measures. This is {{because there is no}} way to treat this disease once it appears in the spring or while the trees have fruit. The most common management approach is to spray the foliage with a copper compound after the fruit has been harvested in the fall and again in the late winter if the environment is extremely wet. A power sprayer with high pressure is the most effective as it helps coat the entire surface of each leaf, even in the interior of the tree. If copper is sprayed onto the fruit it is nearly impossible to wash away, and so late harvests are often lost to infection. The spray comes in various forms of copper hydroxide, copper oxychloride, <b>tribasic</b> copper sulfate, and copper oxide. A few of these have been legally classified as organic.|$|E
50|$|Seeding is {{introduced}} during crystallization. The production is operated continuously under well-defined conditions (pH, feeding rate, concentrations, temperature, etc.). Product with good particle size is produced {{and can be}} easily separated from background salt and other impurities in the mother liquor. After simple rinse with water and drying, pure, free-flowing, non-dusty green crystalline solid with typical particle size of 30 ~ 100 micron is obtained. The product from this process is predominantly atacamite and paratacamite, the stable crystal forms of basic copper chloride - and is called alpha basic copper chloride for simplicity. Careful control of process conditions to favor the alpha polymorphs results in a product that remains free flowing over extended storage times, thus avoiding caking as occurs with both copper sulfate and the botallackite crystal form - also called beta basic copper chloride. This process {{has been used to}} manufacture thousands of tons of <b>tribasic</b> copper chloride every year, and has been the predominant route of commercial production since it was introduced by Micronutrients in 1994.|$|E
50|$|Humic acids are a {{principal}} component of humic substances, {{which are the}} major organic constituents of soil (humus), peat and coal. It is also a major organic constituent of many upland streams, dystrophic lakes, and ocean water. It is produced by biodegradation of dead organic matter. It {{is not a single}} acid; rather, it is a complex mixture of many different acids containing carboxyl and phenolate groups so that the mixture behaves functionally as a dibasic acid or, occasionally, as a <b>tribasic</b> acid. Humic acids can form complexes with ions that are commonly found in the environment creating humic colloids. Humic acids are insoluble in water at acid pH, whereas fulvic acids are also derived from humic substances but are soluble in water across the full range of pH. Humic and fulvic acids are commonly used as a soil supplement in agriculture, and less commonly as a human nutritional supplement.

Fulvic acids are poly-electrolytes and are unique colloids that diffuse easily through membranes whereas all other colloids do not.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of copper as <b>tribasic</b> copper chloride on serum biochemical values and growth performance of broilers intoxicated with aflatoxins. Aflatoxins significantly decreased the level of albumin (P < 0. 001), total protein (P < 0. 001) and total cholesterol (P < 0. 01), and increased the activities of alanine amino transferase, L-lactic dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase (P £ 0. 001) in serum. These AF-induced changes were significantly improved by adding <b>tribasic</b> copper chloride to the diet. The decrease in serum copper concentration induced by aflatoxin was reversed by <b>tribasic</b> copper chloride. Serum zinc concentrations were not affected in <b>tribasic</b> copper chloride and <b>tribasic</b> copper chloride plus aflatoxin groups. Serum iron levels decreased in all the treatment groups significantly (P < 0. 05).

Adverse effects of aflatoxins on feed conversion ratio were reversed by <b>tribasic</b> copper chloride supplementation to the diet.

40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} to determine the relative acidoge-nicities of several anions, including chloride, sulfate, and mono-, di-, and <b>tribasic</b> phosphate in commercial broiler chickens. Graded levels (80 and 160 meq/kg of diet in two experiments; 50, 100, and 150 meq/kg in a third experiment) of all anions were substituted as calcium salts on a molar equiva-lent basis for calcium carbonate in a semipurified diet. All diets contained equivalent amounts of calcium. The occurrence of tibial dyschondroplasia was determined by visual scoring of the epiphyseal growth plate in the distal end of the tibiotarsus. None of the anions added to the diet at levels of 160 meq/kg or less affected body weight or feed consumption. A higher level of chloride (240 meq/kg) that was utilized in some experiments decreased weight gain by 16 to 22 %.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} investigate the effects of added copper on pig performance, tissue copper concentrations and fecal copper excretion. In experiment one, 18 crossbred (Yorkshire x Landrace) barrows weighing an average of 14. 271. 39 kg were housed in stainless metabolism cages for 14 weeks and fed one of three corn-soybean meal based diets (n= 6) supplemented with either 0, 125 or 250 ppm copper from copper sulfate. The total fecal collection method was used to calculate daily fecal copper excretion. All pigs were slaughtered and samples of tissue were collected from the central right liver lobe, left kidney cortex and left longissimus muscle at the 10 th rib. Copper excretion increased with increasing levels of dietary copper addition (p< 0. 01) and with {{the age of the}} pigs (p< 0. 01). Copper levels in muscle, kidney and liver were significantly (p< 0. 01) higher for pigs fed 250 ppm copper compared with pigs fed 0 or 125 ppm copper. In experiment two, 126 crossbred (Yorkshire x Landrace) barrows weighing 13. 061. 36 kg were used in a 3 x 3 factorial experiment in which the pigs were fed diets supplemented with 0, 125 or 250 ppm copper fed in the form of either copper sulfate, copper methionine or <b>tribasic</b> copper chloride for 24 days. The pigs were housed in groups of three with six pens of pigs fed each diet. During the first 12 days of the experiment, pigs fed <b>tribasic</b> copper chloride had significantly improved feed conversion compared with pigs fed copper sulfate or copper methionine. However, during the next 12 days and overall, {{there was no difference in}} daily gain, feed intake or feed conversion for pigs fed the three copper sources.
