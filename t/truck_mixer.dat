40|$|Online mixer {{measurements}} {{appear as}} being {{essential to the}} improvement of concrete manufacturing methods, as imposed by new economical and environmental demands. However, {{the lack of a}} well-established calibration procedure contributes to the poor reputation sometimes given to these measurements. The original in situ method developed and evaluated herein requires installing a sampler, yet only slightly disturbs the production process. By using this calibration method the mixing power becomes a reliable online indication of concrete water content (measurement standard deviation of 2. 85 l/m 3). A procedure for improving the regularity of water content in <b>truck</b> <b>mixers</b> has been presented to illustrate the benefit of well-calibrated online water content measurements in batch concrete in a central mix plant. The correction algorithms proposed herein have the potential to be automated and may improve up to 5 times the water content regularity in the <b>truck</b> <b>mixers...</b>|$|R

40|$|In South Africa, {{concrete}} {{in large}} diameter bored piles is generally placed by discharging a high flow concrete mix {{directly from the}} <b>truck</b> <b>mixer</b> and allowing the concrete to fall freely {{to the base of}} the pile hole. While certain site practices have been used by piling contractors for years, many engineers are not convinced of their acceptability. This paper discusses the results of an investigation which assessed the effect of site practices on the integrity of cast in-situ bored piles. Such practices include the method of concrete placement and the amount of water and/or loose spoil in the pile hole at the time of casting. The results of this investigation dispel the myth that the free fall placement of concrete in clean, dry pile holes has a detrimental effect on the degree of compaction and compressive strength of the concrete...|$|E

Data were collected to assess cycle time, delays, cost of delays, cost of delivery, productivity, and price/m 3 for the CBP. Two ANN models were designated to represent the CBP process considering many CBP variables. Input variables include delivery distance, concrete type, and truck mixer's load. Output variables include the assessment of cycle time, cost of delays, delivery cost, productivity, and price/m 3. The ANN outputs have been validated to show the ANN's robustness in assessing the CBP output variables. The average validity percent for the ANN outputs is 96. 25 %. A Time-Quantity (TQ) chart is developed to assess the time required for both truck mixers and the CBP to produce a specified quantity of concrete.

40|$|In South Africa, {{concrete}} in large-diameter {{bored piles}} is generally placed by discharging a high-flow concrete mix {{directly from the}} <b>truck</b> <b>mixer</b> and allowing the concrete to fall freely {{to the base of}} the pile hole. While certain site practices have been used by piling contractors for years, many engineers are not convinced of their acceptability. In order to assess the effects of free-fall concrete placement, a series of tests were undertaken in which the properties of concrete placed in this manner were compared with the properties of conventionally placed concrete. The tests included an assessment of the effect of water and spoil in the pile hole at the time of casting, as well as poor placement techniques. The results of this investigation indicate that casting of concrete in 50 mm and 400 mm of water in the bottom of the pile hole significantly reduced the compressive strength by approximately 50 % and 80 %, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of spoil at the bottom of the pile hole was dependent on the amount of water present. Finally, a separate investigation, at a bridge site, indicated the free-fall placement technique to be at least as effective as the tremie technique...|$|E
40|$|Returned {{concrete}} is {{the residual}} amount of fresh concrete {{that is not}} placed at the job site {{and returns to the}} ready-mix plant in the <b>truck</b> <b>mixer.</b> According to local conditions, returned concrete may range from 1 to 5 per cent of the overall concrete production, representing a serious burden for the ready-mix plant. Recently, a new sustainable technology has been developed to convert returned concrete into aggregates. The aggregate product consists of size-graded material, for the most part formed by a core of coarse original aggregate with a shell consisting of a finer composite of sand and hydrated cement. The characteristics of the new aggregate depend on many factors, including the compressive strength class of the original concrete. In the present paper, the influence of the class strength of returned concrete on the performance of new concrete made with recycled aggregates produced with the new technology has been investigated. The compressive strength measurements and the permeability tests confirmed {{that it is possible to}} produce high quality concrete mixtures with recycled aggregates obtained from returned concrete by a new technology. Results indicate that in no case the properties and the nominal strength class of the concrete are downgraded by a substantial substitution (30 % by weight) of recycled concrete in place of the natural coarse aggregate. Also water permeability of concrete mixtures is improved by the use of the new aggregates. These results are supported by the microstructural characterization of the material performed by electron microscopy...|$|E
40|$|Crop {{residues}} {{may be used}} {{to produce}} organic composts for agricultural use. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of two inoculums on the decomposition speed of tobacco residues (stems). The experiment was carried out in a completely randomized design, with three treatments and six replications. The residue used in the study was passed through a forage chopper and mixed to the inoculums in a concrete <b>truck</b> <b>mixer.</b> The treatments evaluated were: TF + EB + RB - tobacco residue, bovine manure and bovine rumen; TF + EB + MP - tobacco residue, bovine manure and Microsept-Dust and TF + EB - tobacco residue and bovine manure. The temperature and humidity of the piles were monitored weekly. The piles were initially turned up side down every seven days, and then every fourteen days till closing 60 days. Samples for chemical analysis of the composted material were collected at 30, 60 and 90 days after the beginning of the composting process. The temperature of the piles stayed around 57 to 60 ºC in the period between the 20 to 40 days after the beginning of the composting process. The mix containing cattle rumen (RB) presented the lowest temperature after forty days. At the end of the composting the mix containing Microsept-Dust (MP) presented the lowest humidity. The C/N relation of the composts obtained was around 10 / 1 and 11 / 1. The three treatments presented pH values close to the neutrality in the mature stage. A period of sixty days seems to be sufficient to obtain a mature and stable biocompost of tobacco waste using manure independent of the addition of inoculums. Os resíduos vegetais podem ser utilizados na produção de adubo orgânico por meio da compostagem. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar o efeito de dois inoculantes sobre a velocidade de decomposição do resíduo da cultura do fumo. O experimento foi conduzido em delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com três tratamentos e seis repetições, sendo o resíduo picado em picadeira e misturado aos inoculantes em betoneira. Foram avaliados os tratamentos: TF + EB + RB - talo de fumo, esterco bovino e rúmen bovino; TF + EB + MP - talo de fumo, esterco bovino e microsept-pó e TF + EB - talo de fumo e esterco bovino. A temperatura e a umidade das pilhas foram monitoradas semanalmente. As pilhas foram revolvidas a cada 07 dias, inicialmente e a seguir a cada 14 dias até os 60 dias. Aos trinta, sessenta e noventa dias, foi feita a coleta, para análise química, do material em compostagem. Entre vinte e quarenta dias as pilhas mantiveram temperatura entre 57 e 60 ºC. A mistura contendo rúmen bovino (RB) apresentou a menor temperatura após 40 dias. Ao final da compostagem a mistura contendo microsept-pó (MP) foi a que apresentou menor umidade. A relação C/N, do composto obtido, ficou entre 10 / 1 e 11 / 1. Os três tratamentos apresentaram pH fracamente alcalino na fase de cura. Pode-se considerar que 60 dias de compostagem são suficientes para a obtenção de um composto estabilizado a partir da mistura resíduo de fumo usando esterco, com ou sem a adição de inoculantes...|$|E
