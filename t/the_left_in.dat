5|$|The Earth's {{rotation}} {{causes the}} Coriolis effect, which bends currents {{to the right}} in the Northern Hemisphere and to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the Southern Hemisphere. When this bend brings the currents into more perpendicular contact with the shore, it can amplify the surge, and when it bends the current away from the shore it {{has the effect of}} lessening the surge.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ehrhardt include an 'A' with gently curving bar matching the centre-link of the 'B', a wide 'T' with spreadeagled serifs {{on either side}} and a 'b' with no foot on <b>the</b> <b>left.</b> <b>In</b> italic the 'J' has a crossbar, the 'w' has sharp reverse curves towards the top and left, and the 'v' has a flourish on the left. The face has high stroke contrast (difference between thick and thin strokes) {{by the standards of}} most old-style serif fonts. In order to allow compact line spacing, descenders were kept reasonably short.|$|E
5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> <b>in</b> front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, {{he would have had to}} turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and to the right to see the ground through the side window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|E

5|$|The {{combined}} {{center of}} mass does move slightly to the left when the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, and the bike leans to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> response. The action, in space, would have the tires move right, but this is prevented by friction between the tires and the ground, and thus pushes the combined {{center of mass}} left. This is a small effect, however, {{as evidenced by the}} difficulty most people have in balancing a bike by this method alone.|$|E
5|$|The {{thoracic}} duct, which drains {{the majority}} of the body's lymph, passes behind the esophagus, curving from lying behind the esophagus on the right in {{the lower part of the}} esophagus, to lying behind the esophagus on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the upper esophagus. The esophagus also lies in front of parts of the hemiazygos veins and the intercostal veins on the right side. The vagus nerve divides and covers the esophagus in a plexus.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00 on 14 November the Canterbury Mounted Rifles, {{the brigade}} vanguard, {{encountered}} Turkish observation posts. The brigade ordered {{an attack on}} the main Turkish defences. The regiment was positioned to cover the left flank. Advancing by troops they came under machine-gun fire. The 3rd Squadron was dispatched to occupy the high ground on the regiment's right while the other squadrons took cover. Then a force of Turkish cavalry appeared to their left. McCarroll sent the 11th Squadron to check on their dispositions and numbers. However, the squadron encountered heavy rifle and machine-gun fire and could not move forward. To assist them, two troops from the 4th Squadron, were ordered to charge on horseback. The two troops captured the position and continued forward, occupying the high ground on <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> front of the Wellington Mounted Rifles. The 3rd Squadron, in reserve, provided covering fire as the 11th Squadron moved forward alongside the 4th on their left. Covered by the 4th Squadron, the 11th Squadron moved forward. At 14:15 the advance troops of the 11th Squadron located, in an orange grove, a Turkish concentration of troops that counter-attacked the regiment. McCarroll, who had kept up with his forward line of troops, ordered the rest of the regiment, including headquarters troops, to move up in support of the 11th Squadron. The 3rd Squadron galloped forward, dismounting just behind the front line, and engaged the Turkish attack with enfilade fire, forcing the Turks to retire.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to find the {{equalising}} goal, United manager Alex Ferguson moved Giggs from the centre of midfield to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> order to restore the width of his team and brought on striker Dwight Yorke for Butt. Yorke would spearhead the attack with Van Nistelrooy, a partnership that worked on the club's pre-season tour of Asia. United had another chance in the 68th minute, but Scholes was unable to beat Westerveld, who saved his shot. Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier made his first substitutions of the match soon after; in an attempt to regain control of possession, he brought on Igor Bišćan and Patrik Berger to replace Barmby and Murphy. Liverpool's first chance of the half came in the 81st minute, Bišćan and Owen exchanged passes, before Bišćan shot wide of the goal. United went straight on the attack and a goal-bound shot by Keane was saved by Westerveld. Liverpool replaced Riise with defender Jamie Carragher minutes later in order to see out the game. A minute later, referee D'Urso declined to award United a penalty for the second time when Van Nistelrooy's shot appeared to be blocked by the arm of Henchoz. United continued to push forward for an equaliser, but a long-range shot by Irwin, which went wide, was their only notable chance before the match ended. Liverpool won 2–1 to win the Shield for the 14th time.|$|E
5|$|Khan's {{selection}} {{as a candidate}} was {{seen as part of}} a wider move towards <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> Labour that emerged during the 2015 leadership election that followed Miliband's resignation. Key policies that Khan proposed included a London 'living rent'; a quota system for ethnic minority officers in the Metropolitan Police; increased home building; and a campaign for a London Living Wage. Commentators raised Khan's Muslim religion as a potential barrier to election, after a poll (not mentioning Khan by name) suggested that 31% of Londoners would be 'uncomfortable' with a Muslim mayor. Khan, who was London's first Muslim MP, argued that the election of a Muslim could encourage London to become recognised as a more cosmopolitan city. While Khan had stated that he would serve a full term as MP for Tooting if he were to become Mayor of London, he later announced that would stand down as MP for Tooting if he were elected Mayor.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Beaver Township, {{the creek}} enters Main Township. It {{continues}} following Catawissa Mountain, and, for a shorter distance, Full Mill Hill. It picks up Gap Run and Fisher Run from the left, Scotch Run from the right, and Furnace Run from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> quick succession. After picking up Furnace Run, Catawissa Creek flows between Catawissa Mountain and Nescopeck Mountain in a high, narrow gorge. As the creek leaves the gorge, it passes Mainville and enters a plain. The creek turns west-southwest and the plain narrows slightly. On {{the south side}} of the plain is Catawissa Mountain and on the north side are lower hills. After a few miles, the creek flows out of Main Township and into Catawissa Township. In Catawissa Township, the creek flows southwest to Catawissa. It follows the southern border of Catawissa until it reaches its edge and turns northwards, following the western border of Catawissa. Pennsylvania Route 487 crosses over the creek at this point. At the western edge of Catawissa, the creek empties into the Susquehanna River.|$|E

5|$|Mariners {{have a way}} {{to safely}} {{navigate}} around tropical cyclones. They split tropical cyclones in two, based on their direction of motion, and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (<b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>in</b> the Southern Hemisphere). Sailors term the right side the dangerous semicircle since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm, as the cyclone's translation speed and its rotational wind are additive. The other half of the tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle since weather conditions are lessened (subtractive) in this portion of the storm (but are still potentially quite hazardous). The rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path (crossing the T). Those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the true wind on the starboard bow and make as much headway as possible. Ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the true wind on the starboard quarter while making as much headway as possible.|$|E
