5|$|Not {{knowing that}} Henry VIII had already {{secretly}} married the pregnant Anne Boleyn, Clement VII decided <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> monarch by appointing Thomas Cranmer, an outspoken proponent of Henry VIII's annulment, as archbishop of Canterbury. A threatened excommunication was handed down when Cranmer pronounced Henry VIII's marriage null and void; Henry VIII responded by telling Campeggio's vicar general for Salisbury {{to stop all}} revenues from his bishopric until further notice. Henry VIII then claimed the authority to act on behalf of Campeggio in making various ecclesiastical appointments. The fifth session of the Reformation Parliament deprived Campeggio and Girolamo Ghinucci of their English sees (unless they swore loyalty to the king). Unaware of this statute, two days later on 23 March 1534 Campeggio entered Consistory for the final ruling against annulment.|$|E
5|$|The {{injuries}} that had plagued USC {{throughout the season}} continued as All-American tackle Sam Baker left the game because of a hamstring strain and freshman guard Zack Heberer, already substituting for an injured Chilo Rachal, suffered a shoulder bruise. On the defense, linebacker Rey Maualuga suffered a hip injury and safety Kevin Ellison broke his nose. An uncommon number of injuries, especially along the offensive line, depleted reserve players and forced Trojans <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> general student population {{in order to find}} students with previous lineman experience to help on the scout team's offensive line; however, none were officially added to the roster.|$|E
5|$|In April 1985, Wilkinson {{formed a}} {{campaign}} committee {{in advance of}} the 1987 gubernatorial election. Relatively unknown statewide, Wilkinson was the first candidate to enter the race. The Democratic primary field eventually grew to include two previous Kentucky governors, John Y. Brown, Jr. and Julian Carroll; sitting Lieutenant Governor Steve Beshear, who would later win two terms as governor in 2007 and 2011; and Grady Stumbo, cabinet secretary for Governor Martha Layne Collins. Early in the race, Brown was the clear-cut favorite, while Wilkinson was picked to finish fifth. Wilkinson financed his own campaign and campaign manager Danny Briscoe suggested that he hire a campaign consultant <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state's large concentration of undecided voters. After a few interviews, Wilkinson hired a then-unknown political consultant named James Carville; Carville later went on to chair Bill Clinton's successful presidential campaign in 1992.|$|E

25|$|During this election, {{political}} parties used technology in innovative ways <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> voters. Although SMS {{had been used}} during prior elections, {{political parties}} had realised that the rural and illiterate voters which form a majority couldn't read. Young and technology savvy politicians quickly realised that voice was the way <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rural community as they could speak their language. This {{turned out to be}} very interesting as two voice companies from India, TringMe and VoiceHawk played the pivotal role in reaching out to the billion people of India.|$|E

25|$|Language {{plays an}} {{important}} role in Singapore's politics. Even until today, it is important for politicians in Singapore to be able to speak fluent English along with their Mother Tongue (including different varieties of Chinese) in order <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> multilingual community in Singapore. This is evident in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's annual National Day Rally speech, which is communicated through the use of English, Malay and Mandarin.|$|E

25|$|Class played {{prominent}} {{roles in}} the Victorian vegetarian movement. There was somewhat of a disconnect when the upper-middle class attempted <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> working and lower classes. Though the meat industry was growing substantially, many working class Britons had mostly vegetarian diets out of necessity rather than out of the desire to improve their health and morals. The working and middle classes {{did not have the}} luxury being able to choose what they would eat and they believed that a mixed diet was a valuable source of energy.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though the}} U.S. offers {{protection}} for trafficking victims, few victims seek the government's aid due to fear of corruption, fear of deportation, or fear of reprisals with their family. Victims of trafficking may be citizens of countries with corrupt governments that actually aid trafficking. Where victims' home countries lack reliable police systems, trafficking victims are hesitant <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> law for aid. Jessa Dillow Crisp was of many victims of human trafficking, who had encountered {{the police in}} her town to be corruptive and involved in the trafficking.|$|E

25|$|Beit Avraham have {{traditionally}} been on the lower rungs of Ethiopian social life. They have held occupations {{similar to those of}} the Beta Israel, such as crafts. Recently, the Beit Avraham community has attempted <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> world Jewish community. They formed the Ethiopian North Shewa Zionist Organization in an attempt to save their Jewish identity. This group identifies as the Falashmura. As they do not have reliable proof of Jewish ancestry, Israeli religious authorities and other religious Jewish communities require them to complete a formal conversion to be recognized as Jews. Those who do so are considered converts.|$|E
25|$|Methodist revivalism in early-20th-century Calgary {{promoted}} {{progress and}} bourgeois respectability {{as much as}} spiritual renewal. In 1908, the Central Methodist Church hosted American evangelicals H. L. Gale and J. W. Hatch. They drew big crowds, but the message was mild and the audience calm and well dressed. Few became church members after the revival was over, however. Working-class attendees probably experienced discomfort among their better-dressed and better-behaved neighbors, and the church leadership maintained strong ties to local business interests but did little <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower classes. The cottage meetings that followed the revival typically took place in middle-class homes.|$|E
25|$|Cloud {{computing}} addresses {{two major}} ICT challenges related to Green computing – energy usage and resource consumption. Virtualization, Dynamic provisioning environment, multi-tenancy, green data center approaches are enabling cloud computing to lower carbon emissions and energy usage up {{to a great}} extent. Large enterprises and small businesses can reduce their direct energy consumption and carbon emissions by up to 30% and 90% respectively by moving certain on-premises applications into the cloud. One common example includes Online shopping that helps people purchase products and services over the Internet without requiring them to drive and waste fuel <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> physical shop, which, in turn, reduces greenhouse gas emission related to travel.|$|E

As mayor of a newly united Jerusalem, Kollek’s {{approach}} toward the Arab inhabitants was governed by pragmatism. Within hours of the transfer of authority, he arranged for the provision of milk for Arab children. Some Israelis considered him pro-Arab. Kollek advocated religious tolerance and made numerous efforts <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Arab community during his tenure. Muslims continued to have access to al-Aqsa Mosque and Temple Mount for worship. While he was adamant that Jerusalem never be divided again and remain under Israeli sovereignty, he believed in concessions to reach a final settlement.|$|E
25|$|Huxley's {{interest}} in education went still further than school and university classrooms; {{he made a}} great effort to reach interested adults of all kinds: after all, he himself was largely self-educated. There were his lecture courses for working men, {{many of which were}} published afterwards, and there was the use he made of journalism, partly to earn money but mostly <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> literate public. For most of his adult life he wrote for periodicals—the Westminster Review, the Saturday Review, the Reader, the Pall Mall Gazette, Macmillan's Magazine, the Contemporary Review. Germany was still ahead in formal science education, but interested people in Victorian Britain could use their initiative and find {{out what was going on}} by reading periodicals and using the lending libraries.|$|E

In 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama deployed an additional 30,000 soldiers over a period of six months and proposed that he would begin troop withdrawals by 2012. At the 2010 International Conference on Afghanistan in London, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said he intended <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Taliban leadership (including Mullah Omar, Sirajuddin Haqqani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar). Supported by senior U.S. officials Karzai called on the group's leadership {{to take part in a}} loya jirga meeting to initiate peace talks.
