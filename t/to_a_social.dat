5|$|The New Age {{has also}} been {{identified}} by various scholars of religion {{as part of the}} cultic milieu. This concept, developed by the sociologist Colin Campbell, refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> network of marginalised ideas. Through their shared marginalisation within a given society, these disparate ideas interact and create new syntheses.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, Shakespeare became {{associated}} with rising British nationalism, and Boydell tapped {{into the same}} mood that many other entrepreneurs were exploiting. Shakespeare appealed not only <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> elite who prided themselves on their artistic taste, {{but also to the}} emerging middle class who saw in Shakespeare's works a vision of a diversified society. The mid-century Shakespearean theatrical revival was probably most responsible for reintroducing the British public to Shakespeare. Shakespeare's plays were integral to the theatre's resurgence at this time. Despite the upsurge in theatre-going, writing tragedies was not profitable, and thus few good tragedies were written. Shakespeare's works filled the gap in the repertoire, and his reputation grew as a result. By the end of the 18th century, one out of every six plays performed in London was by Shakespeare.|$|E

5|$|Kieftenbeld {{was twice}} shortlisted for the Eredivisie's annual Maatschappelijk Speler (Community Player) award, which {{brings with it}} a €50,000 prize to be donated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> project of the winner's choice. He was {{actively}} involved with Kids United, a football team for children with disabilities. Although he did not win on either occasion, his charity still benefited when the 2015 winner, Jeroen Zoet, shared the prize money {{with the other two}} nominees. In late July 2015, English club Birmingham City made a bid for Kieftenbeld's services that triggered the release clause in his contract. Although Groningen accepted they could not stop him leaving, they were disappointed not just at losing their captain so soon {{before the start of the}} new season, but at losing a player who did so much for the club in the community.|$|E
5|$|Roughly 30% of {{the student}} body belongs <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> {{fraternity}} or sorority, with additional students involved in professional, service, and honor fraternities. Many of the university's fraternities and sororities are residential, meaning they own or rent a house for their members to use; many of these houses are located on Rugby Road and the surrounding streets, just north of the university. Additionally, three social fraternities hold reserved rooms on the Lawn and the Range: Kappa Sigma in Room 46 East Lawn, Trigon Engineering Society in Room 17 West Lawn, and Pi Kappa Alpha in Room 47 West Range. Reflecting UVA's tradition of student self-governance, the system is currently governed by four Greek Councils consisting of student leaders; however, it is also overseen by the Department of Fraternity and Sorority Life in the university's Office of the Dean of Students.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after their}} accession, William and Mary rewarded John Churchill by {{granting}} him the Earldom of Marlborough and Prince George was made Duke of Cumberland. Anne requested {{the use of}} Richmond Palace and a parliamentary allowance. William and Mary refused the first, and unsuccessfully opposed the latter, both of which caused {{tension between the two}} sisters. Anne's resentment grew worse when William refused to allow Prince George to serve in the military in an active capacity. The new king and queen feared that Anne's financial independence would weaken their influence over her and allow her to organise a rival political faction. From around this time, at Anne's request she and Sarah Churchill, Lady Marlborough, began to call each other the pet names Mrs. Morley and Mrs. Freeman respectively, to facilitate a relationship of greater equality between the two when they were alone. In January 1692, suspecting that Marlborough was secretly conspiring with James's followers, the Jacobites, William and Mary dismissed him from all his offices. In a public show of support for the Marlboroughs, Anne took Sarah <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> event at the palace, and refused her sister's request to dismiss Sarah from her household. Lady Marlborough was subsequently removed from the royal household by the Lord Chamberlain, and Anne angrily left her royal lodgings and took up residence at Syon House, the home of the Duke of Somerset. Anne was stripped of her guard of honour; courtiers were forbidden to visit her, and civic authorities were instructed to ignore her. In April, Anne gave birth to a son who died within minutes. Mary visited her, but instead of offering comfort took the opportunity to berate Anne once again for her friendship with Sarah. The sisters never saw each other again. Later that year, Anne moved to Berkeley House in Piccadilly, London, where she had a stillborn daughter in March 1693.|$|E

25|$|In September 2008 {{a federal}} judge indicted the owner and {{the manager of a}} garment {{sweatshop}} that employed 50 Bolivians, including 20 minors.

25|$|The pay rise {{originally}} {{proposed in}} the government budget ranged between 15%–20%, but the decision to double it was given on heightened worries that widespread anger over prices could lead <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> explosion.

Nonetheless, Claire-Clémence de Maillé had brought the Prince of Condé a dowry of 600,000 livres, the manors of Ansac, Mouy, Cambronne, Plessis-Billebault, Galissonnière and Brézé, and, on one occasion, liberation from the King's dungeon.|$|E

25|$|Historians differ {{over the}} motive for his {{conversion}} to Islam. Some suggest it was a reaction <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> slight inflicted upon {{him because he was}} a Jew, while others suggest he was forcibly converted {{at the edge of a}} sword (which prompted Maimonides to comment upon Anusim). Despite his conversion to Islam, his works continued to be studied at the Jewish Baghdad Academy, a well-known academy, into the thirteenth century. He was a follower of Avicenna's teaching, who proposed an explanation of the acceleration of falling bodies by the accumulation of successive increments of power with successive increments of velocity.|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{theories}} of magic treat magic {{as a personal}} phenomenon intended to meet individual needs, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> phenomenon serving a collective purpose. The explanatory power of magic should not be underestimated, however. Both {{in the past and}} in the modern world, magical belief systems can provide explanations for otherwise difficult or impossible to understand phenomena while providing a spiritual and metaphysical grounding for the individual. Furthermore, as both Brian Feltham and Scott E. Hendrix argue, magical beliefs need not represent a form of irrationality, nor should they be viewed as incompatible with modern views of the world.|$|E
25|$|The Bengal Renaissance refers <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> reform {{movement}} {{during the nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries in the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent during the period of British rule dominated by Bengali Hindus. The Bengal Renaissance can be said to have started with Raja Ram Mohan Roy (1772–1833) and ended with Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941), although many stalwarts thereafter continued to embody particular aspects of the unique intellectual and creative output of the region. Nineteenth century Bengal was a unique blend of religious and social reformers, scholars, literary giants, journalists, patriotic orators, and scientists, all merging to form the image of a renaissance, and marked the transition from the 'medieval' to the 'modern'.|$|E

Misfortune followed Madonna as she returned to Immaculate Conception in the fall of 1944 and received the official diagnosis of tuberculosis (chanhu sica – bad lung in the Lakota language). TB was a huge stigma in this time period. The Indians considered TB akin <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> disease. Indian homes that had a person with TB living in them were quarantined, and a red tag was attached to them. The tag was later removed when the person with TB died or went to the sanatorium.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Pacita married Herman Warns, an {{executive}} of the Manila Gas Corporation. In 1952, she represented the League of Women Voters, the Triennial Congress of International Allience of Women in Naples, Italy and UNESCO Seventh General Conference in Geneva. From 1945 to 1953, Pacita managed her husband's ballet school. Later that year, she gave up the administration of their school to head the Women for Magsaysay Movement (WMPM), which supported the candidacy of the then Ramon Magsaysay for presidency. Upon his assumption of office, Magsaysay appointed Madrigal-Warns as {{the chief of the}} Social Welfare Administration (SWA) in 1953. Later, she re-structured the organization of WMPM from a civic organization <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> welfare society. She also established the Samahang Manang Pacita (Manang Pacita Movement) which focused on community development.|$|E
25|$|The major uprisings {{involved}} the sekbans (irregular troops of musketeers) and sipahis (cavalrymen maintained by land grants). The rebellions were not attempts {{to overthrow the}} Ottoman government but were reactions <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>social</b> and economic crisis stemming {{from a number of}} factors: demographic pressure following a period of unprecedented population growth during the 16th century, climatic hardship associated with the Little Ice Age, a depreciation of the currency, and the mobilization of thousands of sekban musketeers for the Ottoman army during its wars with the Habsburgs and Safavids, who turned to banditry when demobilized. Celali leaders often sought no more than to be appointed to provincial governorships within the empire, while others fought for specific political causes, such as Abaza Mehmed Pasha's effort to topple the Janissary government established after the regicide of Osman II in 1622, or Abaza Hasan Pasha's desire to overthrow the grand vizier Köprülü Mehmed Pasha.|$|E
