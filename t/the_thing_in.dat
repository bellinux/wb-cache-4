25|$|Schopenhauer's {{second major}} {{departure}} from Kant's epistemology concerns the body. Kant's philosophy was formulated {{as a response}} to the radical philosophical skepticism of David Hume, who claimed that causality could not be observed empirically. Schopenhauer begins by arguing that Kant's demarcation between external objects, knowable only as phenomena, and <b>the</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>in</b> Itself of noumenon, contains a significant omission. There is, in fact, one physical object we know more intimately than we know any object of sense perception: our own body.|$|E

25|$|The {{company began}} a wide {{expansion}} of its comics line, {{which would include}} notoriously gory horror comics (the principal title being Steve Ditko's <b>The</b> <b>Thing!).</b> <b>In</b> 1954–55, it acquired a stable of comic book properties from the defunct Superior Comics, Mainline Publications, St. John Publications, and most significantly, Fawcett Publications, which was shutting down its Fawcett Comics division. Charlton continued publishing two of Fawcett's horror books—This Magazine Is Haunted and Strange Suspense Stories—initially using unpublished material from Fawcett's inventory. Artistic chores were then handed to Ditko, whose moody, individualistic touch came to dominate Charlton's supernatural line. Beset by the circulation slump that swept the industry {{towards the end of}} the 1950s, Haunted struggled for another two years, published bi-monthly until May 1958. Strange Suspense Stories ran longer, lasting well into the 1960s before giving up the ghost in 1965.|$|E
25|$|Doom’s armor augments {{his natural}} {{physical}} strength to superhuman levels, {{to the point}} where he is able to overpower normal humans and hold his own against superhuman foes Spider-Man, the Hulk and <b>the</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>in</b> hand-to-hand combat, although he tends to rely on long-range tactics when engaging physically stronger foes. It is also nigh-indestructible, capable of taking hits from most superhuman foes to some cosmic level beings and protecting Doom from matter manipulation, reality warping and psychic assaults. The armor has an arsenal of high tech weaponry and gadgets hidden within it, energy manipulation, absorption and projection, is capable of generating a defensive force field and a lethal electric shock stunning or killing anyone who might come in contact with Doctor Doom. The armor is self-supporting, equipped with internal stores and recycling systems for air, food, water, and energy, allowing the wearer to survive lengthy periods of exposure underwater or in outer space.|$|E
25|$|On June 25, 1982, The Thing {{opened in}} 840 theaters, {{and it was}} the #8 movie of the week at the box office. It {{remained}} in the top 10 for three weeks. The lower-than-expected performance has been attributed to many factors, the main ones being the runaway success of Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, which was also released by Universal Studios two weeks earlier and featured a more optimistic view of alien visitation, and that another major adult-oriented science fiction film, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, was released by Warner Brothers the same day. However, The Thing went on to gain a cult following. The film was eventually reappraised by critics, and is now considered {{to be one of the}} greatest horror films ever made. The film subsequently spawned a novelization in 1982; a comic book miniseries adaptation, entitled The Thing from Another World, published by Dark Horse Comics in 1991; a video game sequel, also titled <b>The</b> <b>Thing,</b> <b>in</b> 2002; and a prequel film with the same title on October 14, 2011.|$|E

25|$|When {{trustees}} fail {{in their}} main duties, the law imposes remedies {{according to the}} nature of the breach. In general, breaches of rules surrounding performance of the trust's terms can be remedied through an award of specific performance, or compensation. Breaches of the duty of care will trigger a right to compensation. Breaches of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and misapplications of property will give rise to a restitutionary claim, to restore the property taken away. In these last two situations, the courts of equity developed further principles of liability that could be applied even when a trustee had gone bankrupt. Some recipients of property that came from a breach of trust, as well as people who had assisted in a breach of trust, might incur liability. Equity recognised not merely a personal, but also a proprietary claim over assets taken in breach of trust, and perhaps also profits made in breach of the duty of loyalty. A proprietary claim meant that the claimant could demand <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> priority to other creditors of the bankrupt trustee. Alternatively, the courts would follow an asset or trace its value if the trust property was exchanged for some other asset. If trust property had been given to a third party, the trust fund could claim back the property as of right, unless the recipient was a bona fide purchaser. Generally, any recipient of trust property who knew about the breach of trust (or maybe ought to have known) could be made to give back the value, even if they had themselves exchanged the thing for other assets. Lastly, against people who may never have received trust property but had assisted in a breach of trust, and had done so dishonestly, a claim arose to return the property's value.|$|E

There were complementary actions against the occupier of the property where the stolen goods were found, if the defendant did not bring the thing to court or refused a search. Vindicatio or condictio could also be undertaken by the owner of <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>in</b> addition to an action under furtum.|$|E

Consequently, there was a significant rise in standards of play to the level that is now termed important.|$|E

2500|$|The 'two-world' {{interpretation}} regards Kant's {{position as}} a statement of epistemological limitation, {{that we are not}} able to transcend the bounds of our own mind, meaning that we cannot access the [...] "thing-in-itself". However, Kant also speaks of <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> itself or transcendental object as a product of the (human) understanding as it attempts to conceive of objects in abstraction from the conditions of sensibility. Following this line of thought, some interpreters have argued that <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> itself does not represent a separate ontological domain but simply a way of considering objects by means of the understanding alonethis is known as the two-aspect view.|$|E
2500|$|Arthur Schopenhauer was {{strongly}} influenced by Kant's transcendental idealism. He, like G. E. Schulze, Jacobi, and Fichte before him, was critical of Kant's theory of <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> itself. Things in themselves, they argued, are neither the cause of what we observe nor are they completely beyond our access. Ever since the first Critique of Pure Reason philosophers {{have been critical of}} Kant's theory of <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> itself. Many have argued, if such a thing exists beyond experience then one cannot posit that it affects us causally, since that would entail stretching the category 'causality' beyond the realm of experience. For a review of this problem and the relevant literature see <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>in</b> Itself and the Problem of Affection in the revised edition of Henry Allison's Kant's Transcendental Idealism. For Schopenhauer things in themselves do not exist outside the non-rational will. The world, as Schopenhauer would have it, is the striving and largely unconscious will. Michael Kelly, in the preface to his 1910 book Kant's Ethics and Schopenhauer's Criticism, stated: [...] "Of Kant it may be said that what is good and true in his philosophy would have been buried with him, were it not for Schopenhauer...." ...|$|E
