5000|$|The lifts took {{different}} forms. F W Bolton, {{the manager}} of Farleigh Mill, is credited with introducing the [...] "traverser" [...] type by 1891. This consisted of an overhead <b>travelling</b> <b>winch</b> which traversed a horizontal beam supported by two posts. The cane was laid flat on a sling in a dray which was driven under the winch. The winch was used to hoist the bundle of cane which was traversed about two metres and lowered into a tramway wagon parked next to the dray. The lift was praised at the time for greatly reducing loading times and enabling the cane to be packed more densely. Apparently this type of lift was widely adopted {{but there are no}} known examples extant in the Mackay area.|$|E

As sea conditions requiring a drogue are usually hazardous to be on deck, itâ€™s usually smart to fully deploy all of the rode associated with a storm drogue. Also, the series drogue can be deployed safely with one hand from the cockpit as can any other storm drogue. Recovering a series drogue before the storm abates takes effort, but the process is safe and straightforward. It can be winched in on sheet winches if the cones are small enough to <b>travel</b> around the <b>winch</b> drum without jamming. The series drogue is currently made by three manufacturers, one in Australia, one in the United States and one in the United Kingdom. Any sailmaker can make one and you can make one yourself, though it is a tedious job.|$|R
