Several protestors, at least five of whom were illegal immigrants, were arrested while protesting the law at the statehouse when <b>they</b> <b>broke</b> into Daniels' office after being denied a meeting. Student leaders called for their release, while some state legislators called for their deportation.|$|E
5|$|City were relegated again {{five seasons}} later, but when O'Rourke was reappointed as manager before the 1928–29 season, <b>they</b> <b>broke</b> several club records to earn {{promotion}} back to Division Two. After eight seasons in Division Two, City returned to Division Three, and they {{remained in the}} third and fourth tiers of the English football league system until 1985–86. During that time, they endured several periods of financial hardship, and in 1985, their ground suffered a disastrous fire in which 56people died, on a day the club and their fans were supposed to be celebrating promotion.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{deployed}} his own forces {{along the}} whole length of Maxentius' line. He ordered his cavalry to charge, and <b>they</b> <b>broke</b> Maxentius' cavalry. He then sent his infantry against Maxentius' infantry, pushing many into the Tiber {{where they were}} slaughtered and drowned. The battle was brief: Maxentius' troops were broken before the first charge. Maxentius' horse guards and praetorians initially held their position, but broke under {{the force of a}} Constantinian cavalry charge; they also broke ranks and fled to the river. Maxentius rode with them, and attempted to cross the bridge of boats, but he was pushed by the mass of his fleeing soldiers into the Tiber, and drowned.|$|E

5|$|However, not {{everyone}} {{was satisfied with}} the new liturgical and political directions of the AFM. Wessel's political ties led to the radicalization of younger black pastors, {{the loss of the}} majority of the English membership, and a major division of Afrikaner members who did not share his political views. These Afrikaners not only disagreed with Wessel politically but also with du Plessis liturgically. In 1958, <b>they</b> <b>broke</b> from the AFM and formed the Pentecostal Protestant Church.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Usher {{began dating}} TLC member Chilli Thomas, and their {{relationship}} lasted for two years. In 2003, Usher started working on the album which would become Confessions, which contained songs inspired by the personal lives of Usher and his collaborators. The songs about infidelity and pregnant mistresses were inspired not by Usher's private life, but by Jermaine Dupri's own personal challenges at the time. Dupri deliberately intended to create an air of mystery about Usher, and arouse fans' curiosity about {{how much of the}} infidelity story was Usher's own confession. The unintended result of this was to arouse Thomas's suspicions about Usher. <b>They</b> <b>broke</b> up in December 2003.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 it {{was unclear}} if Beth Israel, which had already been in {{difficult}} financial shape, would be allowed, or have the means, to re-build its synagogue. The building suffered further flood damage in July 2007 when thieves stole the copper tubing for the main air-conditioning system. <b>They</b> <b>broke</b> the water main, and water from the second floor flooded the building for three days, {{to a depth of}} three to four feet, before it was discovered. The property was put up for sale.|$|E

5|$|Ray Davies (lead vocals, rhythm guitar) and Dave Davies (lead guitar, vocals) {{remained}} members {{throughout the}} band's 32-year run. Longest-serving member Mick Avory (drums and percussion) {{was replaced by}} Bob Henrit, formerly of Argent, in 1984. Original bass guitarist Pete Quaife was replaced by John Dalton in 1969, and Dalton was in turn replaced by Jim Rodford in 1978. Session keyboardist Nicky Hopkins accompanied the band in the studio for many of their recordings in the mid-to-late 1960s. In 1969 the band became an official five-piece when keyboardist John Gosling joined them, being replaced by Ian Gibbons in 1979, who remained in the band until <b>they</b> <b>broke</b> up in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The Indians were {{a harder}} fight; {{they were out}} of the main field of battle, skirmishing on the edge of an {{adjacent}} swamp. Richard Johnson eventually ordered a suicide squad of twenty men to ride forward and draw the Indians' fire, planning to charge with the rest as they reloaded. But the ground before the Indian position was too swampy to support many cavalry. Johnson had to order his men to dismount and hold until Shelby's infantry came up. But eventually <b>they</b> <b>broke,</b> and fled into the swamp, during which time Tecumseh was slain, some say by Johnson, others believing it was someone else.|$|E
5|$|The Lions {{rushed for}} 190yards, while holding the Buccaneers to 47. Lions quarterback Chuck Long was 12 of 23 for 108yards and a touchdown, while Testaverde was 20–39 for 262yards and a touchdown. The Lions intercepted Testaverde once and sacked him four times, as <b>they</b> <b>broke</b> a four-game losing streak. Testaverde was lucky {{that it was}} not worse, as three of his {{potential}} turnovers were called back due to Lions penalties. On another two occasions, balls that bounced off of his receivers' fingertips wound up caught by other Buccaneer receivers.|$|E

5|$|The Skagen Painters were a {{group of}} Scandinavian artists who visited the area every summer from the late 1870s until {{the turn of the}} century. They were {{attracted}} by the scenery, the fishermen and the quality of light which encouraged them to paint en plein air following the example of the French Impressionists while sometimes adopting the Realist approach of the Barbizon School. <b>They</b> <b>broke</b> away from the rigid traditions of the Danish and Swedish art academies, preferring the modern trends they had experienced in Paris.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Army {{captured}} {{large numbers}} of German armored vehicles, including Panzer IVs (Russian designation T-4). Some of them were pressed into temporary service and some others were used for training. Sometimes, captured tanks were used in different temporary units or as single tanks. While captured Tigers and Panthers were only permitted to be used until <b>they</b> <b>broke</b> down, {{the simplicity of the}} Panzer IV and the large number of captured parts allowed for repair and continued use.|$|E
5|$|The Sun-grazing comets of 1668, 1689, 1702 and 1945 seem to {{be closely}} related to those of 1882 and 1965, {{although}} their orbits are not well enough determined to establish whether <b>they</b> <b>broke</b> off from the parent comet in 1106, or the previous perihelion passage before that, {{some time in the}} 3–5th centuries AD. This subgroup of comets is known as Subgroup II. Comet White–Ortiz–Bolelli, which was seen in 1970, is more closely related to this group than Subgroup I, but appears to have broken off during the previous orbit to the other fragments.|$|E

The Knicks returned to win the championship again a season later to record their second ever victorious season.|$|E
5|$|Willis {{was engaged}} to actress Brooke Burns until <b>they</b> <b>broke</b> up in 2004 after ten months together. He married model Emma Heming in Turks and Caicos on March 21, 2009; guests {{included}} his three daughters, Demi Moore, and Ashton Kutcher.

The couple has two daughters: Mabel Ray Willis (b. 2012) and Evelyn Penn Willis (b. 2014).|$|E
5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth and status. One retainer even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any retainer was allowed to come and go from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} retainers, but when <b>they</b> <b>broke</b> laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E
