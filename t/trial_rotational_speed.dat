40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the performance of the}} separating system of a self–propelled peanut harvester by analyzing the relationship between a shaking screen and <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds</b> of winnowing. The shaking screen was manufactured to have <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds</b> of 370, 470, 570 rpm and winnowing was manufactured to have <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds</b> of 1, 500, 1, 760, 2, 020 rpm by adjusting the pitch circle diameter of each pulley. The sample was prepared based on the yields of an actual self–propelled peanut harvester and analyzed with Statistical Analysis Software after measuring the weight of peanuts and stems. The stem separation ratio was high as 95. 3 % when <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds</b> were 570 rpm (shaking screen) and 2, 020 rpm (winnowing). The peanut loss ratio was low as 0 % when <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds</b> were 370 rpm (shaking screen) and 1, 500 rpm (winnowing). The results indicated that the stem separation ratio was improved with high <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds</b> of shaking screen and winnowing; the peanut loss ratio was reduced with low <b>rotational</b> <b>speeds</b> of shaking screen and winnowing. However, the <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> of winnowing did not influence on the peanut loss ratio; as a result, separation performance was improved with low <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> of shaking screen and high <b>rotational</b> <b>speed</b> of winnowing.
