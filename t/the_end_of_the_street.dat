25|$|Numerous {{pieces of}} {{evidence}} linked Chikatilo to Zakotnova's murder: spots of blood {{had been found in}} the snow near the house Chikatilo had purchased; neighbours had noted that Chikatilo had been present in the house on the evening of 22 December; Zakotnova's school rucksack had been found upon the opposite bank of the river at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> (indicating the girl had been thrown into the river at this location); and a witness had given police a detailed description of a man closely resembling Chikatilo, whom she had seen talking with Zakotnova at the bus stop where the girl had last been seen alive. Despite these facts, a 25-year-old labourer named Aleksandr Kravchenko who, as a teenager, had served a prison sentence for the rape and murder of a teenage girl, was arrested for the crime. A search of Kravchenko's home revealed spots of blood on his wife's jumper: the blood type was determined to match both Zakotnova and Kravchenko's wife.|$|E
25|$|During the Troubles, {{as part of}} its armed {{campaign}} against British rule in Northern Ireland, the Provisional IRA had repeatedly used homemade mortars against targets in Northern Ireland. The most notable attack was the 1985 Newry mortar attack which killed nine members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The IRA had carried out many attacks in England, but had not used mortars there. However, in December 1988 items used in their construction and technical details regarding the weapon's trajectory were found during a raid in Battersea, South London by members of the Metropolitan Police Anti-Terrorist Branch. In the late 1980s British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was top of the IRA's list for assassination, following the failed attempt on her life in the Brighton hotel bombing. Security around Downing Street had been stepped up at a cost of £800,000 following increased IRA activity in England in 1988, including the addition of a police guard post and security gates at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Plans to leave a car bomb on a street near Downing Street and detonate it by remote control as Thatcher's official car was driving by had been ruled out by the IRA's Army Council owing to the likelihood of civilian casualties, which some Army Council members argued would have been politically counter-productive.|$|E

500|$|In November 1927 Aiello {{organized}} machine-gun ambushes {{across from}} Lombardo's {{home and a}} cigar store frequented by Capone, but those plans were foiled after an anonymous tip led police to raid several addresses and arrest Milwaukee gunman Angelo La Mantio and four other Aiello gunmen. After the police discovered receipts for the apartments in La Mantio's pockets, he confessed that Aiello had hired him to kill Capone and Lombardo, leading the police to arrest Aiello himself and bring him to the South Clark Street police station. Upon learning of the arrest, Capone dispatched nearly two dozen gunmen to stand guard outside the station and await Aiello's release. The men {{made no attempt to}} publicly conceal their purpose there, and reporters and photographers rushed to the scene to observe Aiello's expected murder. Capone gunmen Frank Perry, Sam Marcus and Louis [...] "Little New York" [...] Campagna were arrested as they tried to enter the front of the station and placed in the cell next to Aiello, who Campagna told, [...] "You're dead, friend, dead. You won't get up to <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> still walking". Aiello pleaded for mercy and promised to sell his possessions and leave Chicago with his family if they let him go, but Campagna refused the request. When released, Aiello was given a police escort out of the station to safety. He later failed to make a court appearance after his attorney claimed he suffered a nervous breakdown. Aiello disappeared with some of family members to Trenton, NJ, where he continued his campaign against Capone and Lombardo.|$|E
500|$|Later in 2012, Lawrence {{played a}} young {{depressed}} widow named Tiffany Maxwell in David O. Russell's romance movie Silver Linings Playbook. The film was {{an adaptation of}} the Matthew Quick's novel of the same name. It follows her character finding companionship with Pat Solitano Jr. (played by Bradley Cooper), a man with bipolar disorder. The actress was drawn to her character's complex personality: [...] "She didn't really fit any basic kind of character profile. Somebody who is very forceful and bullheaded is normally very insecure, but she isn't". Russell considered Lawrence to be too young for the part; she convinced him to hire her via a Skype audition. She found herself challenged by Russell's spontaneity as a director, and described working on the project as the [...] "best experience of my life". Richard Corliss of Time wrote: [...] "Just 21 when the movie was shot, Lawrence is that rare young actress who plays, who is, grown-up. Sullen and sultry, she lends a mature intelligence to any role." [...] Peter Travers believed that Lawrence [...] "is some kind of miracle. She's rude, dirty, funny, foulmouthed, sloppy, sexy, vibrant, and vulnerable, sometimes {{all in the same}} scene, even in the same breath." [...] She won the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film, becoming—at age 22—the second youngest Best Actress Oscar winner. Her final release of the year was alongside Max Thieriot and Elisabeth Shue in Mark Tonderai's critically panned thriller House at <b>the</b> <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Street.</b>|$|E
