40|$|This paper {{describes}} a Query-Driven Simulation (QDS) approach <b>to</b> <b>asking</b> <b>questions</b> about outcomes of business processes. In this approach a user issues a query about outcomes of simulation runs and, {{based on the}} query asked, appropriate simulations are launched {{and the answer to}} the query is determined from the outcomes of these simulations. It is argued that Query-Driven Simulations provide a more declarative, flexible, and interactive approach <b>to</b> <b>asking</b> <b>questions</b> about simulation outcomes than the traditional approaches of letting the end-users run simulations and gather statistics about simulation outcomes. The paper also presents a new simulation system development lifecycle based on the QDS approach. ...|$|R

5|$|Quantitative {{methods are}} often used <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> about a {{population}} that is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable subset of a population. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding {{the population as a}} whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best to sample randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling, such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{support is}} the most obvious method of {{vocabulary}} development in school-age children. It involves giving direct verbal information {{of the meaning of}} a word. By the time children are in school, they are active participants in conversation, so they are very capable and willing <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> when they do not understand a word or concept. For example, a child might see a zebra {{for the first time and}} ask, what is that? and the parent might respond, that is a zebra. It is like a horse with stripes and it is wild so you cannot ride it.|$|E

5|$|Series creator David Wolstencroft {{believed}} that writing Tom {{was the most}} fun, yet the hardest work compared with other characters, because he was Spooks primary protagonist. Wolstencroft chose a job in Information Technology (IT) as the cover story Tom used in his relationship with Ellie, because he felt that in real life people are reluctant <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> about IT work. To portray the character, actor Matthew Macfadyen followed the scripts, {{and did not want}} to deviate from them, as he did not believe doing so would be useful. Macfadyen was also keen to explore parts of Tom from within him for influence.|$|E

5|$|When the {{legislature}} {{met for the}} first time after the 1909 election, things seemed to be going well for Rutherford and his government. He controlled a huge majority, albeit slightly reduced from the 1905 election, and enjoyed widespread popularity. His government had achieved significant success in setting up a new province, and this success looked poised to continue. Early in this new legislative session, however, two signs of trouble appeared: Liberal backbencher John R. Boyle began <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> about the agreement between the government and the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company, and Cushing resigned from cabinet over his views of this same agreement.|$|E
30|$|The initial {{number of}} {{research}} questions in Rebecca’s class {{was higher than}} that in Sam’s class. This difference {{could be explained by}} the fact that Rebecca’s students had experienced inquiry and the <b>asking</b> of research <b>questions</b> on other occasions, besides the Bio-Tech program, as mentioned by Rebecca. Therefore, as suggested in other studies (Chin and Osborne 2008; Lombard and Schneider 2013), it is important to provide students with opportunities to learn and practice <b>asking</b> research <b>questions</b> in earlier years and in a variety of educational activities. Previous findings regarding the teaching and learning of how <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> research <b>questions</b> in authentic-inquiry environments suggest that students’ ability <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> research <b>questions</b> improve following explicit classroom instruction (Chin 2002; Chin and Osborne 2008; Cuccio-Schirripa and Steiner 2000; Roth and Roychoudhury 1993). Similarly, our results indicate that 11 th-grade biotechnology students’ ability <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> research <b>questions</b> improved following explicit instruction on how <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> research <b>questions</b> in the lesson that included dialogic and interactive whole-class discussions.|$|R

5|$|When Marseille {{returned}} to his unit he asked his friends Franzisket, Clade and Schröer, whether they had heard {{what was happening to}} Jews and if perhaps something was underway {{that they did not know}} about. Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> about Jews who had vanished from his neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, or people changed the subject or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He never spoke of this with his comrades again.|$|E
5|$|A cancer-stricken Hadden, now in {{residence}} on the Mir space station, reveals to Arroway {{that a second}} machine was secretly made in Japan, and that Arroway {{will be the one}} to go. Outfitted with several recording devices, Arroway enters the machine's pod, which is then dropped into four rapidly spinning rings, causing the pod to apparently travel through a series of wormholes. Arroway sees a radio array-like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization on another planet. She then finds herself on a beach, similar to a childhood picture she drew of Florida, and a figure approaches that becomes her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father's form and attempts <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions.</b> The alien tells her that the familiar landscape and form were used to make their first contact easier for her and that this journey was just humanity's first step to joining other spacefaring species.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} saw {{a substantial}} increase in international media coverage. Eighty foreign media representatives from a multitude of countries registered for an event at the Foreign Ministry held during the election weekend as it usually is. The journalists also got <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>questions</b> to the representatives of the various political parties. As the results came in, the Foreign Ministry set up broadcast coverage with interpreters on hand. Notably, most journalists were interested in the True Finns and their background. The following day, the Foreign Ministry invited professor Jan Sundberg of the Department of Political and Economic Studies at the University of Helsinki to lead an analysis of the result. He was asked about the reasons for the True Finns' performance and the commonality with other European populist movements. There was also discussion about the possible composition of a new government and how the different parties could find common ground during talks on government formation. Sundberg said he believed an agreement could be found within the following few weeks.|$|E
