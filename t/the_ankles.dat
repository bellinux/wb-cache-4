5|$|Heinrich Mallison from Berlin's Museum of Natural History also {{presented}} a theory in 2011, suggesting that Tyrannosaurus {{and many other}} dinosaurs may have achieved relatively high speeds through short rapid strides instead of the long strides employed by modern birds and mammals when running, likening their movement to power-walking. This, according to Mallison, would have been achievable irrespective of joint strength and lessened {{the need for additional}} muscle mass in the legs, particularly at <b>the</b> <b>ankles.</b> To support his theory, Mallison assessed the limbs of various dinosaurs and found that they were different from those of modern mammals and birds; having their stride length greatly limited by their skeletons, but also having relatively large muscles at the hindquarters. He found a few similarities between the muscles in dinosaurs and race-walkers; having less muscle mass in <b>the</b> <b>ankles</b> but more at the hindquarters. John Hutchinson advised caution regarding this theory, suggesting that they must first look into dinosaur muscles to see how frequently they could have contracted.|$|E

50|$|Sagittal plane {{motions of}} <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> occur at <b>the</b> talocrural joint. As the heel {{contacts}} <b>the</b> ground <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> joint is near neutral in either slight plantar flexion or dorsiflexion. Immediately following heel strike <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> plantar flexes until the foot is positioned {{flat on the}} ground. This plantar flexion movement is controlled eccentrically by <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> dorsiflexors. As <b>the</b> body glides over the fixed foot, a maximum of about 10 degrees of ankle dorsiflexion is reached. <b>The</b> <b>ankle</b> dorsiflexion {{is a result of}} the tibia moving forward over the foot and is facilitated by eccentric control provided by the soleus. Concurrently, the knee reaches full extension and as the heel rises off <b>the</b> ground <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> begins to plantar flex. <b>The</b> <b>ankle</b> reaches a maximum of 15-20 degrees of plantar flexion right before push-off which is accomplished concentrically by the plantar flexor muscles.

5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their trousers at <b>the</b> <b>ankles</b> before placing two ferrets inside and securely fastening their belts to prevent the ferrets from escaping.

5|$|The 1941 VFL season {{went ahead}} despite {{the loss of}} many players to {{military}} service. Miller alternated between playing in the backline and in attack depending on match conditions. When St Kilda were kicking downwind, Miller would play in attack, and when they kicked against the wind, {{he would return to}} a defensive position. In the forward line, he alternated with Sam Loxton, a future Invincibles teammate. He booted 28 goals in 16 games, including eight in one match against North Melbourne. Miller also gained a reputation among opponents for kicking them in <b>the</b> <b>ankles.</b> He again showed his disrespect for authority and reputation. In one match against Melbourne, for whom his boss and state cricket teammate Percy Beames played, Miller charged towards Beames with a raised elbow {{at the start of the}} match, forcing his boss to be taken from the field. Miller came second in St Kilda's best and fairest for 1941 as his team again came second to last.|$|E
5|$|Medical student Georges Garoyan {{published}} a thesis on Calment {{when she was}} 114 years old in January 1990. The first part records her daily routine (see above), and the second presents her medical history. According to this, she had been vaccinated as a child but could not remember the vaccine. Apart from aspirin against migraines she had never taken medicines, not even herbal teas, and had never had German measles, chickenpox, hypertension, diabetes or urinary infections. Concerning her heart, she presented with a moderate left ventricular dysfunction. In April 1986 at age 111 she was admitted to hospital for heart failure and treated with digoxin. More recently she had presented with athropathies in <b>the</b> <b>ankles,</b> elbows and wrists which were successfully treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Clinical examination revealed arterial blood pressures of 140mm/70mm, a temperature of 37 Celsius, a pulse of 84/min, a height of 150cm and a weight of 45 kilogrammes which had varied little in previous years. She scored well on mental tests except on numeric tasks and recall of recent events. Her blood values were normal between ages 111â€“114, with no signs of dehydration, anaemia, chronic infection or renal impairment. Genetic analysis of the HLA system revealed {{the presence of the}} DR1 allele, common among centenarians. The electrocardiogramme revealed left ventricular hypertrophy with a mild left atrial dilatation and extrasystolic arrhythmia. Radiology revealed diffuse osteoporosis and in the right hip, incipient osteoarthritis. Ultrasound revealed no anomalies of internal organs.|$|E

25|$|Unlike when {{a person}} is {{suspended}} by their wrists, rope suspension around <b>the</b> <b>ankles</b> can be maintained for much longer as the ankle region naturally is able to take far more weight and stress than the wrists. This is especially so if boots are used as the ropes can run around the outside surface of the boot thus protecting the skin from damage. The person may be suspended with their legs together, or held apart either by using a spreader bar or by securing <b>the</b> <b>ankles</b> to two separate locations. With the legs held in this position, the subject may have an increased sense of vulnerability as their genital region would be easily accessible.|$|E

25|$|Eversion and inversion: Stretching the {{eversion}} and inversion muscles {{allows for}} better {{range of motion}} to <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> joint.

Eversion muscles are stretched when <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> becomes depressed from the starting position. In like manner, the inversion muscles are stretched when <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> joint becomes elevated. Throughout this seated stretch, <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> joint is to remain supported while depressed and elevated with the ipsilateral (same side) hand in order to sustain the stretch for 10â€“15 seconds. This stretch will increase overall eversion and inversion muscle group length and provide more flexibility to <b>the</b> <b>ankle</b> joint for larger range of motion during activity.|$|R
