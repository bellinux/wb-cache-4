5|$|On November 19, 1948 Lafayette College {{was invited}} by the Sun Bowl Committee {{to play against}} the Texas College of Mines, now The University of Texas at El Paso. Just four days later, on November 23, the Lafayette faculty voted {{to turn down the}} bid because the Sun Bowl Committee would not allow Showell <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> <b>This</b> bid {{rejection}} led to a large student demonstration on the Lafayette campus and in the city of Easton against segregation.|$|E
5|$|This {{record is}} {{a version of}} our now deleted and illegal LP '1987, What The Fuck Is Going On?' {{with all of the}} {{copyright}} infringing 'samples' edited out. As this leaves less than 25 minutes of music we are able to sell it as a 12-inch 45. If you follow the instructions below you will, after some practice, be able to simulate the sound of our original record. To do this you will need 3 wired-up record decks, a pile of selected discs, one t.v. set and a video machine loaded with a cassette of edited highlights of last weeks 'Top of the Pops'. Deck one is <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>this</b> record on, the other two are to scratch in the missing parts using the selected records. For added authentic effect you could use a Roland 808 drum machine (well cheap and what we used in the original recordings) to play along behind your scratching.|$|E

25|$|Backyard cricket has connotations to {{the past}} time of Australian {{children}} who had large expansive backyards where they were able <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>this</b> informal game of sport often with friends, family and neighbours.|$|E
25|$|When four-valved models {{without any}} kind of {{compensation}} play in the corresponding register, the sharpness becomes so severe that players must finger the note a half-step below the one they are trying <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> <b>This</b> eliminates the note a half-step above their open fundamental.|$|E

25|$|Ian Meckiff had {{destroyed}} their batting lineup in the just-completed second Test and their bad luck continued when {{two of their}} players were injured in a car smash on their journey up to Wagga from Melbourne.

25|$|The devastation {{caused by}} Hurricane Katrina in late 2005 caused {{a few people}} to {{question}} {{the future of the}} city's Mardi Gras celebrations. Mayor Nagin, who was up for reelection in early 2006, tried <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>this</b> sentiment for electoral advantage. However, the economics of Carnival were, and are, too important to the city's revival.|$|E

25|$|The main phase occurs {{immediately}} after the draw phase. During the main phase, a player may play any card {{from his or her}} hand unless that card specifies otherwise, and as long as he or she has the mana to pay its casting cost. This means creature, planeswalker, sorcery, instant, land, enchantment, and artifact cards are all acceptable <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> <b>This</b> is a player's chance to bring something onto the field.|$|E

The pack consists of eight optional missions, ranging from courier, assassination and protection objectives.|$|E
25|$|In November 2003 Great Britain lost an Ashes series 0–3 on home soil, having led {{all three}} matches {{with less than}} five minutes <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> <b>This</b> was {{considered}} one of the most humiliating defeats in Great Britain Test history, as with injuries and pullouts, Australia had sent a virtually third-choice side to Great Britain. Great Britain was heavily favoured to win the Ashes, but lost each Test. Waite stepped down from his role.|$|E

25|$|On 31 January 2017, it was {{confirmed}} that Jiangsu Suning loaned Sainsbury to sister club Internazionale until 30 June 2017. He made his debut on 28 May 2017 in a 5–2 win over Udinese {{in the last}} round of the season, coming on as a substitute for Davide Santon with twenty minutes <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> <b>This</b> made him the first Australian to make a senior appearance for Internazionale (Nathan Coe and Carl Valeri, former Australian internationals, only played for their reserves).|$|E
25|$|Depending on the {{religious}} community a musician belonged to, it {{was more or less}} considered a sin <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>this</b> low-down music: blues was the devil's music. Musicians were therefore segregated into two categories: gospel singers and blues singers, guitar preachers and songsters. However, when rural black music began to be recorded in the 1920s, both categories of musicians used similar techniques: call-and-response patterns, blue notes, and slide guitars. Gospel music was nevertheless using musical forms that were compatible with Christian hymns and therefore less marked by the blues form than its secular counterpart.|$|E
25|$|One of his {{trademarks}} {{was the use}} of {{two different}} bouncers. One was delivered at a slower pace and was often dealt with quite easily by the batsman. However, this was a ploy by Roberts to lull the batsman into a false sense of security. Roberts would then deliver the second bouncer, pitching in a similar spot to the first, but delivered at far greater pace. The batsman would attempt <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>this</b> delivery in the same fashion as the first slower bouncer only to be surprised by the extra pace and bounce of the ball. Many batsmen were dismissed, and many more struck painful blows, by Roberts using this ploy.|$|E

25|$|As part of {{the move}} to Frostbite, BioWare decided to unite the combat systems of the single and {{multiplayer}} modes. In Mass Effect 3, the single-player mode used a system tailored to a slower, cover shooter approach while the multiplayer mode used a system tailored to a faster-paced approach. It was important to BioWare that, for all gameplay modes in Mass Effect: Andromeda, the player stay moving and have a strategy behind every action as opposed to remaining in one location for the entire duration of an encounter. To encourage players <b>to</b> <b>play</b> <b>this</b> way, BioWare built open combat layouts, which required the programming of complex artificial intelligence so that enemies could understand space {{and know how to}} flank the player from all angles.|$|E
25|$|McLeish's Scotland side {{then went}} on to defeat the Faroe Islands away in June, Lithuania at home in September before {{recording}} a historic victory in Paris four days later by defeating France 1–0 in the Parc des Princes. James McFadden's 64th-minute strike from 30 yards was enough to earn Scotland the win and returned them to the top of Group B with three games <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> <b>This</b> result has been hailed as one of the Scotland national team's greatest victories. Scotland's next success was at home to Ukraine, winning 3–1 at Hampden on 13 October. McLeish suffered his second defeat as manager, away in Georgia on 17 October. This result left him facing a decider against the World Champions, Italy. Scotland lost the game, McLeish's last, and Italy qualified for the finals.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, 1994 Copa Libertadores {{champion}} Vélez Sársfield and 1994 Supercopa Sudamericana champion Independiente declined <b>to</b> <b>play.</b> <b>This</b> only {{left the}} 1994 Copa CONMEBOL and 1995 Supercopa Masters champions in the tournament. Cruzeiro faced São Paulo; {{in the first}} leg in Belo Horizonte, São Paulo managed to win 0-1 before the game was suspended at the 47th minute due to Cruzeiro having four players sent off {{in the first half}} (they had used all the substitutions) and having one injured player leaving just six in the field for the Reposa; in accordance with the regulations, the minimum number of players per team is seven. However, Cruzeiro managed to come back from and win 0-1 in the Morumbi to eventually win the trophy on penalties. Due to scheduling conflicts, this season was played as part of the Supercopa Sudamericana, specifically the quarterfinal stage.|$|E
