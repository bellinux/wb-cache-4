I knew I hadn't jumped out of my comfort zone, which at the time was writing alone and working with Nathan. [...] the song was a real turning point for Red the album. When I wrote that song my mind started wandering to all <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>we</b> could go. If I were to think outside the box enough, go in with different people, I could learn from and have what they do rub off on me as well as have what I do rub off on them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film also {{features}} two robots, CASE and TARS (as {{well as a}} dismantled third robot, KIPP). Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots anthropomorphic and chose a [...] quadrilateral design. The director said: [...] "It has a very complicated design philosophy. It's based on mathematics. You've got four main blocks {{and they can be}} joined in three ways. So you have three combinations you follow. But then within that, it subdivides into a further three joints. And all <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>we</b> see lines—those can subdivide further. So you can unfold a finger, essentially, but it's all proportional." [...] Actor Bill Irwin voiced and physically controlled both robots, but his image was digitally removed from the film and his voicing for CASE was replaced with actor Josh Stewart's voice.|$|E

60|$|We all sat {{silent in}} <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>we</b> had chosen--Mrs. Vesey still sleeping, Miss Fairlie still playing, Miss Halcombe still reading--till the light failed us. By {{this time the}} moon had stolen round to the terrace, and soft, mysterious rays of light were {{slanting}} already across {{the lower end of}} the room. The change from the twilight obscurity was so beautiful that we banished the lamps, by common consent, when the servant brought them in, and kept the large room unlighted, except by the glimmer of the two candles at the piano.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} it hailed, which {{afterward}} turned to rain, {{but in the}} afternoon there was only showers now and then, so that we {{spent most of the}} time on deck. On this boat we met a very nice Englishman and his wife, and when they had heard us speak to each other they asked us if we had ever been {{in this part of the}} world before, and when we said we hadn't they told us about <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>we</b> passed. If we had been an English couple who had never been there before they wouldn't have said a word to us.|$|E
60|$|We {{finished}} it as before in a canal boat, {{and the rest}} of mind and body, and the sense of approaching Millicent, certainly did Eustace good; the hectic fever lessened, and though he slept little at night, he had much good slumber by day, lying on cloaks on deck as we quietly glided along the water, between the fields full of corn, with harvest beginning, and the tall cocks of hay in the large fields, all plenty and high cultivation, and peaceful industry, in contrast with <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>we</b> had left devastated by civil war, and the famished population.|$|E

6000|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} a gang of road-cutters (who had been sent out by the towns interested in the route) came into town from Hazleton, and I had a talk with the boss, a very decent fellow, who gave a grim report of the trail beyond. He said: [...] "Nobody knows anything about that trail. Jim Deacon, the head-man of our party when we left Hazleton, was only about seventy miles out, and cutting fallen timber like a man chopping cord wood, and sending back for more help. We are now going back to bridge and corduroy <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>we</b> {{had no time to}} fix as we came." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've done my best {{to share}} your rotten, scheming life," [...] she cried, [...] "to help you in your dirty ways, and to crawl up into <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>we</b> coveted! Once I saw the truth. Once a real man was kind to me and I saw the difference. I've felt it in my heart ever since. For your sake and my own, {{for the sake of}} our rotten, miserable ambitions, I ruined him and sent him to his death. He is dead, do you hear? You and I did it! We are murderers!

I don't think Anne has so much as seen an American tree. She never looks at a prospect by any chance, or displays the smallest emotion at any sight whatever.

The old man cut up rusty at first, and seemed disposed to drive us away, but by howling the name of Osten into his ears and giving him a little gold, we converted him into a friend, and got him to allow us to squat in the empty house. Then we went off prospecting, and found gold, sure enough, in the stream in front of the door, but there was not much in <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>we</b> tried--little more than enough to pay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know much}} about those matters, but I do know that it takes about five years' grinding, and what is called 'walking the hospitals,' that is, going round the wards with the surgeons, before one is {{licensed}} to kill. I think, but I am not sure, that three years at the bar would admit you to practice, and usually another {{seven or eight years}} are spent, before you earn a penny. As for the Church, {{you have to go through}} the university, or one of <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>we</b> call training colleges; and when, at last, you are ordained, you may reckon, unless you have great family interest, on remaining a curate, with perhaps one hundred or one hundred and fifty pounds per annum, for eighteen or twenty years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} you can help in at present, Marion, {{and it will be}} much more useful for you to spend a month in {{learning}} things at Mr. Mitford's. You undertook to do the cooking; and I am sure that will be quite necessary, for father and mother could never eat the food our Maori cook turns out. And then you have got to learn to make butter and cheese and to cure bacon. That is a most important point, for we must certainly keep pigs and cure our own as Mr. Mitford does, for the stuff they have got at most of <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>we</b> touched at was almost uneatable. So, you see, there is plenty to occupy your time until you move in here, and our comfort will depend a vast deal upon the pains you take to learn to do things properly." ...|$|E
