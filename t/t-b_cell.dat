50|$|His {{research}} has covered {{several aspects of}} human immunology. Antigen processing and presentation. Using clones of antigen-specific B and T cells, he demonstrated that B cells efficiently capture, via membrane immunoglobulins, the specific antigen, which is then internalized, and processed into peptides, which are presented to T helper cells in an extraordinarily efficient manner (1). This study uncovered a critical {{step in the process}} of <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> cooperation that is essential for high affinity antibody production and represents the basis for the development of glycoconjugate vaccines. In subsequent studies, he showed that antigens can be effectively targeted to surface molecules other than membrane immunoglobulins (2, 3), a finding that has contributed to current strategies of antigen targeting to improve vaccination. Finally, he addressed the role of HLA class II molecules as receptors for self versus foreign peptides and showed how inflammatory stimuli can enhance the loading of pathogen-derived peptides on newly synthesized HLA Class II molecules so as to favour host-protective immunity (4, 7).|$|E
40|$|We have {{explored}} {{the consequences for}} the B cell of cognate interaction with T cells. Early expression of the B cell-restricted cell surface activation antigen, BLAST- 2, {{has been used as}} an assay system to measure direct <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> collaboration. BLAST- 2 is preferentially expressed by allogenic B cells cultured with MHC class II antigen- restricted Th clone cells matched to the DR specificity of the target B cells. B cells cultured with DR-mismatched allospecific Th cells express minimal BLAST- 2. Th cell-induced BLAST- 2 expression appears to be accessory cell independent and occurs as early as 8 h after initiation of culture, with peak expression at 18 h. Direct <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> contact, rather than Th-derived lymphokines, provides the most efficient stimulus for BLAST- 2 expression. Crosslinking of sIg on B cells is a poor stimulus for BLAST- 2 expression. The BLAST- 2 assay permits the evaluation of early events associated with B cell activation through cognate interactions, and may facilitate subsequent studies of the mechanism of B cell differentiation...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{specific}} anti-I-J reagents on macrophage-T cell interactions was studied in an in vitro antibody response to burro erythrocytes. Macrophages were prepared from the spleens of F 1 hybrid mice whose parental strains differed at the I-J subregion. Two F 1 hybrids {{were used for}} these experiments, [B 10. A(3 R) X B 10.

When F 1 macrophages were pretreated with anti-I-J serum (without complement) specific for one parental haplotype, they were only able to cooperate with T helper (TH) cells of the unblocked haplotype and with F 1 TH cells. Identical results were obtained with (Jb X Jk) F 1 and (Js X Jk) F 1 mice.

40|$|Male Lewis rats (6 weeks-old) were {{submitted}} to a calorie restriction equivalent to 33 % or 66 % of food restriction. Fifteen days later, groups of 7 animals were injected with complete Freund's adjuvant plus spinal cord homogenate (SCH) to induce experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) or with complete Freund's adjuvant alone. EAE was defined solely on clinical grounds. Rats were assessed daily for clinical signs of EAE and were killed on day 15 after immunization. Both diet and SCH injection diminished body weight significantly. In contrast to rats receiving a normal diet or a 33 % calorie-restricted diet, rats subjected to severe calorie restriction did not exhibit clinical signs of EAE.

40|$|We have {{suggested}} before that thymus-independent immune responses to certain antigens {{are caused by}} special properties of the antigens concerned, namely that they are B-cell mitogens (1). Actually all thymus-independent antigens (TI) 1 we have tested so far {{were found to be}} competent to activate DNA and polyclonal antibody synthesis in nonprimed B cells cultured in vitro (2). Since the TI antigens can directly induce division and differentiation in B cells, it is evident that <b>T-B</b> <b>cells</b> cooperation would not be required for the induction of specific immune responses. However, there is an apparent paradox between the ability of a mitogen to induce an antigen-specific immune response to its own antigenic determinants, and its ability to activate polyclonal antibody synthesis in all B cells, irrespective of their specificities. The paradox can be easily explained by assuming two fundamentally different types of antigen binding to the cell surfaces. At low (immunogenic) concentrations, TI antigens would be preferentially bound by lg receptors on specific antigen-binding B cells, whereas at high (mitogenic) concentrations also, other B cells (lacking specific receptors for the antigenic determinants of these molecules) would bind a sufficient number of molecule...|$|R
40|$|Several {{experimental}} approaches, {{designed specifically}} to circumvent the possible contribution of a complicating "allogeneic effect," have been successfully used {{to answer the question}} of physiologic cooperative interactions between histoincompatible T and B lymphocytes in antibody responses to hapten-protein conjugates. This was accomplished for in vivo cell transfer studies by using an F 1 hybrid host as the recipient of irradiated, carrier-primed T lymphocytes from one parent and 2, 4 -dinitrophenyl (DNP) -primed B lymphocytes from the opposite strain. Under these conditions, very good <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> cooperative interactions were observed to occur between T and B lymphocyte populations derived from syngeneic donors, whereas no cooperative response was obtained when T cells were derived from one parental strain and B cells from the other. Corroborative experiments were performed in a totally in vitro system in which DNP-primed B cells developed good secondary anti-DNP antibody responses in vitro to soluble DNP-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) when cultured in the presence of irradiated KLH-primed T cells derived from syngenic donors but not from allogeneic donors. The failure of histoincompatible T and B lymphocytes to effect physiologic cooperative interactions has important implications for our understanding of how such interactions normally occur. The possibility that these results reflect the existence of a "block" of some sort to cell-cell interaction by virtue of the presence of a foreign major histocompatibility antigen on the surface of either cell has been definitively ruled out in the present studies. These observations demonstrate that the gene(s) that conditions the capability for physiologic <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> cooperation must be shared in common by the respective cell types, and suggest, furthermore, that this gene (or genes) belongs to the major histocompatibility system of the mouse. These findings, together with other relevant phenomena described previously, have led us to postulate that there exists on the B lymphocyte surface an "acceptor" molecule either for the putative active T cell product or for the T cell itself. The important genetic considerations and the possible sequence of events surrounding the actual <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> interaction implied by these postulates are discussed in detail...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT We {{have studied}} the role of major {{histocompatibility}} antigens on cell cooperation in the immune response of the chicken. In the 1970 's, shortly after the initial discoveries in the mouse, we demonstrated that the T cell-B cell interaction is major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -dependent in the chicken and requires at least one haplotype identity between the collaborating cells. Later, by using MHC-congenic and MHC-recombinant lines, we demonstrated that the <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> interaction in antibody response is MHC-restricted, and more precisely, Class II MHC-antigen-restricted. Furthermore, we proved that <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> cooperation in splenic germinal center formation is likewise class II MHC antigen-restricted. Recently, we have focused our studies on MHC antigen identity requirements during antigen presentation by macrophages to T cells. In these studies, Class II antigens were found to serve as restriction elements in antigen recognition by T cells. Cytotoxic T cells of the chicken {{have been shown to}} be MHC-restricted in their function. Whether Class I or Class II MHC antigens serve as restriction molecules has not yet been determined.

40|$|Alternative {{splicing}} generates various Ly- 5 glycoprotein isoforms of {{the cell}} surface that typify different cell lineages and stages of hematopoietic differentiation in the mouse; exons 4 - 6 are incorporated to generate a B-cell isoform (B 220) and excluded from a T-cell isoform (T 200), the other coding exons (3 and 7 - 33) being shared. As a first step to understanding the mechanisms regulating Ly- 5 alternative splicing, and thus determining Ly- 5 isoforms, a minigene representing exons 3 - 7 was transfected into Ly- 5 -expressor T cells and B cells and into nonexpressor L cells for comparison of splicing patterns. We conclude that all the information required for faithful splice-site selection according to cell type is contained within the resulting pre-mRNA. The splicing pattern manifested by nonexpressor L cells may represent a default and nonregulated type. We postulate trans-acting factor(s) {{to account for the}} selection of appropriate exons, and we provide support for this interpretation from analysis of fused hybrid <b>T-B</b> <b>cells,</b> which exhibited B-cell specific Ly- 5 transcripts.

40|$|The recent {{identification}} of coreceptors that mediate efficient entry of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) suggests new therapeutic and preventive strategies. We analyzed simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) entry cofactors to investigate whether the macaque SIV model {{can be used as}} an experimental model to evaluate these strategies. Similar to primary HIV- 1 isolates, a well-characterized molecular clone, SIVmac 239, which replicates poorly but efficiently enters into rhesus alveolar macrophages and an envelope variant, SIVmac 239 / 316 Env, with an approximately 1, 000 -fold-higher replicative capacity in macrophages used the beta-chemokine receptor CCR 5 for efficient entry. The transmembrane portion of 316 Env allowed low-level entry into cells expressing CCR 1, CCR 2 B, and CCR 3. A single amino acid substitution in the V 3 loop of SIVmac 239 / 316 Env, 321 P [...] >S, impaired the ability to enter into the <b>T-B</b> hybrid <b>cell</b> line CEMx 174 but had relatively little effect on entry into primary cells and HOS. CD 4 cells expressing CCR 5. Although CEMx 174 cells do not express CCR 5, most SIVmac variants entered this hybrid cell line efficiently but did not enter the parental T-cell line CEM.

40|$|SummaryCurrent {{models of}} the {{germinal}} center (GC) response propose that after stimulation {{at the edges of}} T cell zones, pre-GC B cells directly migrate to the center of follicles and proliferate to form GCs. We followed the interrelationship of proliferation, differentiation, and microenvironmental locale in populations of pre-GC B cells responding to antigen. In contrast to the predictions of current models, after accumulation at the <b>T-B</b> interface, these <b>cells</b> appeared at the perimeter of follicles adjacent to the marginal zone. There, they rapidly proliferated for several days but underwent no V gene hypermutation and little heavy-chain class switching. Their chemokine receptor expression pattern indicated that these cells were sessile, yet they had begun to acquire many phenotypic characteristics of GC B cells. The expanded clones were subsequently observed in the center of follicles, suggesting that GCs are created by coalescence of B cells from this follicular perimeter response...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{presented in}} this paper demonstrate the existence of T- T cell interactions in responses to azobenzenearsonate (ABA) -protein conjugates, and also make the point that the spectrum of T-cell regulation from facilitation (i. e., help) at one end to suppression at the other, which has been well documented in <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> interactions, is also followed in T-cell regulation of other T lymphocytes. The data extend the activity of ABA-specific suppressor cells, which were shown to specifically suppress the development of delayed hypersensitivity to ABA-T, to T cells responsible for delayed hypersensitivity to protein antigens provided immunization is carried out with ABA conjugates of these antigens. Thus, suppressor T cells acting on the development of delayed hypersensitivity are not limited in their effects to T cells bearing the same specificity but can effectively suppress responses on immunologically unrelated T cells if they are specific for carrier antigens covalently linked to the ABA-T determinant. Moreover, these studies demonstrate that, as is true of <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> interactions, the most efficient T-T cell interactions occur to determinants linked together on the same molecule thus supporting the concept that development of effector T-cell function may involve participation of at least two distinct precursor cells, each of which may convey independent determinant specificities and/or genetic control...|$|E
40|$|Anti-Ig {{has been}} widely used {{as a model for}} antigen receptor-mediated B cell activation. B cells {{activated}} with mitogenic concentrations of anti-Ig (approximately 10 micrograms/ml) become responsive to a set of T cell-derived, antigen-nonspecific helper factors that enable the B cells to proliferate, and, in some cases, mature to Ig secretion. In the present experiments, we show that anti-Ig can also be used as a model for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -restricted, antigen- specific <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> collaboration. We used murine helper T cell lines and T cell hybridomas specific for a protein antigen, the F(ab') 2 fragment of normal rabbit IgG. Small B cells are very efficient at presenting rabbit anti-IgM or rabbit anti-IgD to these rabbit Ig-specific T cell lines and hybridomas, and the responding (initially) small B cells, appear to be the only antigen-presenting cells required. Efficient presentation depends upon binding of rabbit antibody to mIg on the B cell surface. MHC-restricted recognition of rabbit Ig determinants on the B cell surface results in a polyclonal B cell response. This response is qualitatively different from the well-studied response to blastogenic concentrations of anti-Ig plus stable, T cell-derived helper factors, since it (a) requires 1, 000 -fold lower concentrations of anti-Ig, (b) involves helper T cell functions other than, or in addition to, the local production of the same stable helper factors, and (c) is largely MHC-restricted at the <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> level...|$|E
40|$|Bcl- 2 {{expression}} is tightly regulated during lymphocyte development. Mature lymphocytes in Bcl- 2 -deficient mice show accelerated spontaneous apoptosis in vivo and in vitro. Stimulation of Bcl- 2 -deficient lymphocytes by anti-CD 3 antibody inhibited the spontaneous apoptosis {{not only in}} T cells but also in B cells. The rescue of B cells was dependent {{on the presence of}} T cells, mainly through CD 40 L and interleukin (IL) - 4. Furthermore, we generated Bcl- 2 -deficient mice transgenic for a T cell receptor or an immunoglobulin, both specific for chicken ovalbumin, to test for antigen-specific <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> interaction in the inhibition of the spontaneous apoptosis. The initial T cell activation by antigenic peptides presented by B cells suppressed apoptosis in T cells. Subsequently, T cells expressed CD 40 L and released ILs, leading to the protection of B cells from spontaneous apoptosis. These results suggest that the antiapoptotic signaling via CD 40 or IL- 4 may be largely independent of Bcl- 2. Engagement of the Ig alone was not sufficient for the inhibition of B cell apoptosis. Thus, the physiological role of Bcl- 2 in mature lymphocytes may be to protect cells from spontaneous apoptosis and to extend their lifespans to increase the opportunity for T cells and B cells to interact with each other and specific antigens in secondary lymphoid tissues. Bcl- 2, however, appears to be dispensable for survival once mature lymphocytes are activated by antigen-specific <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> collaboration...|$|E
40|$|We have {{deliberately}} targeted {{collaboration between}} T cells and certain B cells {{by using a}} heteroconjugate (HETCONJ) antibody. This specific reagent was created by cross-linking the F(ab') 2 portions of anti-I-Ab and anti-CD 3 monoclonal antibodies. Spleen cells from B 6 (I-Ab) but not bm 12 (I-Abm 12) mice proliferated in vitro {{in the presence of}} the HETCONJ. Similarly, T-cell dependent IgM secretion was induced in B cells from B 6, yet only weakly in B cells from bm 12 mice. Using B cells from Igh allotype double congenic (B 6. C 20 Igha/I-Ab and bm 12, Ighb/I-Abm 12) mice in co-culture experiments, we have used the HETCONJ to study linked versus bystander T-B interaction. B-cell activation, mediated by HETCONJ, was 10 times greater in unseparated than in resting splenic B <b>cells.</b> <b>T-B</b> interaction through T-B contact was more efficient than activation through bystander effects both for unseparated and resting splenic B cells. Large, already activated B cells, in contrast, did not show a preference for linked recognition.

40|$|Background Latently {{infected}} cells {{represent a}} major obstacle to the cure of infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1). We have observed that the propensity to establish latency varies greatly among primate lentiviruses. The purpose of our study is to identify the features that determine such variation in order to elucidate the fine molecular mechanisms regulating latency. Materials and methods Using GFP–encoding reporter viruses, the level of infection by SIV, HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 was quantitated by flow cytometry in cells stably expressing HIV- 1 Tat, SIV Tat or vector alone. Results We have observed that SIVmac 239 infects human lymphoid cells much less efficiently than HIV- 1. However, ectopic expression of HIV- 1 Tat rescued SIV infection. As host cell type can influence viral gene expression, we tested different cell lines {{for their ability to}} support lentiviral latency. In both T (Jurkat TAg and C 8166) and <b>T-B</b> hybrid <b>cell</b> lines (CEMX 174) SIV exhibited a greater ability to remain transcriptionally silent within the human genome than HIV- 1 or HIV- 2. The different behaviour in terms of latency was particularly evident in CEMX 174 cells, where HIV Tat activation caused more than 20 -fold {{increase in the number of}} GFP-positive cells infected with SIV, while it had little effect on cells challenged with HIV- 1 or HIV- 2. The lower level of productive infection displayed by SIVmac 239 was not due to a reduced ability of SIV Tat to trigger viral expression in human cells because SIV Tat overexpression reactivated latent SIV as well as HIV Tat did. Moreover, HIV- 1 chimeric viruses harboring the U 3 region of SIV behaved like the parental HIV- 1 viruses, suggesting that viral determinants of SIV latency reside in a part of the lentiviral genome different from the promoter region. Conclusions In human cell lines transduction with SIVmac 239 largely establishes a latent infection which is reactivated by overexpressing HIV- 1 or SIVmac 239 Tat. The tendency of SIVmac 239 to establish latent infection is attributable neither to a defective SIV Tat activity nor to a reduced promoter activity of the U 3 region in human lymphoid cells. The CEMX 174 cell line offers a good model to explore the specific viral determinants which allow SIV to enter latency...|$|R
40|$|Within 2 min {{following}} the intravenous injection of sheep erythrocytes (sRBC) there occurs 20 to 80 -fold increase in prostaglandin (PG) F 2 alpha in the spleen. This burst of synthesis {{is followed by}} a slow decline to control levels over the next 1 - 4 hr. No increase in splenic PGF 2 alpha levels is observed between 24 and 72 hr after injection. Injection of colloidal carbon results in a small increase, approximately 20 % of the increase in PGF 2 alpha observed with sRBC. The early increase in splenic PGF 2 alpha levels stimulated by sRBC is also dependent upon thymus-derived (T) cells, since the increase is small or nonexistent in athymic mice and NZB mice. Also, the elevation of splenic PGF 2 alpha levels is blocked by the administration of indomethacin or Ro 20 - 5720, both of which block the synthesis of prostglandin. A small increase (2 -fold) in PGF 2 alpha levels occurs in the thymus. A soluble antigen, bovine gamma globulin, stimulated a bimodal increase in splenic PGF 2 alpha levels, the early peak occurring at 2 hr and the later increase occurring at 48 hr. Using inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis, it is possible to enhance the appearance of cells forming 19 S antibody against sRBC, both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis enhances DNA synthesis induced in a two-way mixed-lymphocyte reaction only in whole spleen cell cultures and not in cultures of spleen cells purified by passage over glass wool. Based on this evidence, it is proposed that the prostaglandins represent a major soluble mediator in the control of T cell-T cell interactions and also play an important part in <b>T-B</b> (bone-marrow derived) <b>cell</b> interactions...|$|R
40|$|In general, humoral immune {{responses}} depend critically upon T cell help. In transplantation, prevention {{or treatment}} of humoral rejection therefore require drugs that ideally inhibit both B cell and T helper cell activity. Here, we studied {{the effects of}} commonly used immunosuppressive drugs [tacrolimus, cyclosporin, mycophenolic acid (MPA) and rapamycin] on T cell helper activity and on T cell-dependent B cell responses. T cells were activated polyclonally {{in the presence of}} immunosuppressive drugs in order to analyse the effect of these drugs on T cell proliferation, co-stimulatory ligand expression and cytokines. The impact of immunosuppressive drugs on T cell-dependent immunoglobulin production by B cells was addressed in <b>T–B</b> <b>cell</b> co-cultures. All drugs affected T cell proliferation and attenuated T cell co-stimulatory ligand (CD 154 and CD 278) expression when T cells were activated polyclonally. Tacrolimus, cyclosporin and rapamycin also attenuated B cell stimulatory cytokine mRNA levels in T cells. As a consequence, a decrease in immunoglobulin levels was observed in autologous <b>T–B</b> <b>cell</b> co-cultures, where T cell help is essential for immunoglobulin production. In contrast, when pre-activated T cells were used to stimulate autologous B cells, calcineurin inhibitors failed to inhibit B cell immunoglobulin production, whereas MPA and rapamycin did show inhibition. From these studies, it is evident that calcineurin inhibitors affect the humoral immune response by interfering with T helper signals, but not by targeting B cells directly. Furthermore, our studies support the necessity of intervening in T cell helper function to attenuate humoral responses...|$|E

40|$|Tissue {{cultures}} {{with two}} compartments, {{separated by a}} cell impermeable nuclepore membrane (1 µ pore size), were used to investigate the mechanism of T-B lymphocyte cooperation. It was found that collaboration was as effective when the T and B lymphocyte populations were separated by the membrane as when they were mixed together. Critical tests were performed to verify that the membranes used were in fact cell impermeable. The specificity of the augmentation of the B cell response by various T cell populations was investigated. Only the response of B cells reactive to determinants on the same molecule as recognized by the T cells was augmented markedly. Specific activation of thymocytes by antigen was necessary for efficient collaboration across the membrane. The response of both unprimed and hapten-primed spleen cells was augmented by the T cell "factor" although, as expected, hapten-primed cells yielded greater responses. The T cell factor acted as efficiently if T cells were present or absent in the lower chamber. Thus the site of action of the T cell factor was not on other T cells, but was either on macrophages or the B cells themselves.

We found that FDCs were essential for autoantibody production through two distinct but cooperative functions. In a T cell-independent fashion, FDCs loaded with autoantigen-containing immune complexes supported germinal center (GC) B cell development. Additionally, the integrity of FDC networks was required for the recruitment of arthritogenic follicular helper T cells, a process that drove <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> interactions and productive GC reactivity.

It is further shown that B-cell activity in the assay is dependent on T-helper cells as well as macrophages and/or their secretory products.

This effect of the mAb was carrier specific, could not be ascribed simply to a shift in the kinetics of the antibody response and was observed using apocytochrome c T helper cells of different mouse haplotypes. In addition, the anti-apocytochrome c mAb was able to inhibit specific T helper cell activity even when the T cells were triggered with antigen-presenting cells pulsed with antigen. Taken together, these results suggested that the mAb was inhibiting helper activity due to its ability to modify the interaction between T cells and antigen-presenting cells...|$|E

40|$|Infants {{respond to}} antigen by making {{antibody}} that is generally of low affinity for antigen. Somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes, and selection of cells expressing mutations with improved affinity for antigen, are the molecular and cellular processes underlying the maturation of antibody affinity. We have reported previously that neonates and infants up to 2 months of age, including individuals undergoing strong immunological challenge, show very few mutated V(H) 6 sequences, with low mutation frequencies in mutated sequences, and {{little evidence of}} selection. We have now examined immunoglobulin genes from healthy infants between 2 and 10 months old for mutation and evidence of selection. In this age group, the proportion of V(H) 6 sequences which are mutated and the mutation frequency in mutated sequences increase with age. There is evidence of selection from 6 months old. These {{results indicate that the}} process of affinity maturation, which depends on cognate <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> interaction and functional germinal centres, is approaching maturity from 6 months old...|$|E
40|$|Adoptive anti-trinitrophenyl (Tnp) {{responses}} were elicited from Tnp-hemocyanin (Tnp-KLH) -primed cells by challenge with an immune complex of KLH and a Tnp conjugate of the Fab fragment of rabbit anti-KLH. Removal of T cells by treatment with anti-Thy 1. 2 (phi C 3 H) + complement abolished this effect. Tnp-KLH primed cells {{that had been}} incubated with a Tnp conjugate of pneumococcal polysaccharide type III (Tnp-SIII), and which were then unable to respond to Tnp-KLH, made an anti-Tnp response upon incubation with rabbit anti-Dnp when transferred together with cells primed with rabbit gamma globulin. Since Tnp-KLH was not added in these experiments, {{it would appear that}} the cells were triggered by immune complexes on their surfaces consisting of Tnp-SIII and rabbit anti-Dnp with the help of T cells primed with rabbit gamma globulin; the presence of free antigen was evidently not required. Therefore, antigen-antibody complexes, when bound to the surface of B cells, may mediate <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> cooperation in the humoral immune response...|$|E
40|$|Follicular T helper (TFH) cells orchestrate the {{germinal}} center (GC) response locally. TFH localization in GCs is controlled by chemo-guidance cues and antigen-specific adhesion. Here. we define an antigen-independent, contact-dependent, adhesive guidance system for TFH cells. Unusual for amoeboid cell migration, {{the system is}} composed of transmembrane plexin B 2 (PlxnB 2) molecule, which is highly expressed by GC B cells, and its transmembrane binding partner semaphorin 4 C (Sema 4 C), which is upregulated on TFH cells. Sema 4 C on TFH cells serves as a receptor to sense the GC-presented PlxnB 2 cue and biases TFH migration inwards at the GC edge to promote GC access. The absence of PlxnB 2 from the GC or Sema 4 C from TFH cells causes TFH accumulation along the GC border, impairs <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> interactions in the GC, and is associated with defective plasma cell production and affinity maturation. Therefore, Sema 4 C and PlxnB 2 regulate GC TFH recruitment and function and optimize antibody responses...|$|E
40|$|In the {{preceding}} paper (1), experimental data were presented that demonstrated {{the capacity of}} a heavily irradiated host to exert an active allogeneic effect (2, 3) on adoptively transferred, histoincompatible, DNP-specific B lymphocytes. This finding places great restrictions on model systems used to study the possibility of cooperative interactions between carrier-primed T and hapten-specific B lymphocytes of differing histocompatibilities. For brevity, we will again refer to antigen-specific cell interactions as "physiologic " <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> cooperation, contrasting with the allogeneic effect. In this report, we describe appropriate in vivo and in vitro experimental protocols designed to study physiologic cooperation between histoincompatible T and B cells under conditions that avoid the allogeneic effect. These results provide unequivocal proof that totally histoincompatible carrier-primed T lymphocytes fail to provide the required stimulus for the responses of B cells to hapten-carrier conjugates, whereas semiallogeneic T and B cells are capable of interacting effectively in the normal manner, and effect physiologic cooperatio...|$|E
40|$|The spatial {{relationship}} for <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> cooperation between antigenic epitopes and carrier epitopes on the antigen molecule was studied. Two mono-DNP substituted derivatives of hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL), DNP 1 - 33 HEL and DNP 1 - 96 HEL {{were used as}} antigens; the former is dinitrophenylated only at lysine- 33 and the latter only at lysine- 96. Fragment peptides of HEL were used to induce specific T cells to the respective sites of the antigen. Adoptive cell-transfer experiments of site-specific T cells and DNP-primed B cells directly showed that multiple distinct carrier epitopes for T cells could help the antibody responses to the single antigenic epitope for B cells and that a single carrier epitope could help antibody responses to multiple antigenic epitopes. T cells primed with a synthetic peptide SP 34 - 54 (corresponding to sequence 34 - 54 of HEL) co-operated with DNP-primed B cells on challenge with DNP 1 - 96 HEL, but not with DNP 1 - 33 HEL...|$|E
40|$|The neisserial porins are {{the major}} protein {{components}} of the outer membrane of the pathogenic Neisseria (N. meningitidis and N. gonorrhoeae). They {{have been shown to}} be able to enhance the immune response to poorly immunogenic substances (e. g., polysaccharides, peptides, glycolipids, etc.). To explore the basis of their potent adjuvant activity, the effect of the neisserial porins on <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> interactions and T cell costimulation was examined. Neisserial porins increased the surface expression of the costimulatory ligand B 7 - 2 (CD 86) but did not affect the expression of B 7 - 1 (CD 80). In addition, incubation with the neisserial porins increased the T lymphocyte costimulatory ability of B lymphocytes, which was inhibited by anti-B 7 - 2 but not anti-B 7 - 1 monoclonal antibodies. Upregulation of B 7 - 2 on the surface of B lymphocytes may be the mechanism behind the immunopotentiating activity of neisserial porins...|$|E
40|$|Mononuclear phagocytes {{are thought}} to play a {{regulatory}} role in immune induction, {{although there is no}} general consensus on their exact mode of action. Phagocytes are capable of multiple functions-uptake, endocytosis, catabolism and retention of foreign molecules, activation by extracellular events, secretion of enzymes and other regulatory molecules, etc. As a result of these diverse functions, it would not be surprising for phagocytes to influence the immune process at different stages of its development and evolution. One of the explanations for the role of macrophages in inductive events is that it takes up and presents antigen molecules in an appropriate manner, serving as an antigen-focusing cell for <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> interactions (1 - 3). This is the explanation that appeals more to us based on the superior immunogenicity of macrophageassociated antigen and its counteraction by free soluble materials (4, 5). However, other experiments strongly suggest that phagocytes contribute in some other way to inductive events apart from simple presentation of antigen: (a) in the guinea pig, macrophage associated antigen stimulates T-cell proliferatio...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{increased}} {{level of}} apoptotic material and B cell activation leading to autoantibody production are hallmarks of systemic lupus erythematoses (SLE). Increased FAS expression, apoptosis, and CD 154 -mediated signaling, enabling <b>T–B</b> <b>cell</b> interaction {{are involved in}} the pathogenesis of SLE. This study addresses the expression profile of CD 154 and FAS in the peripheral blood of patients with SLE, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and normal healthy control donors. Surface markers on peripheral blood T and B cells from patients and healthy control donors were assessed using flow cytometry. The expression of CD 154 and FAS were significantly increased in T and B cells of SLE patients as compared to healthy control donors and RA patients. In SLE and RA patients, FAS expression strongly correlated with CD 154 expression on T cells, which was not found in healthy control donors. FAS expression was also associated with the occurrence of anti-DNA antibodies. We demonstrate high CD 154 and FAS expression as a characteristic feature of SLE. This pattern may reflect simultaneous activation of apoptosis and activation of B–T cell interaction in SLE...|$|E
40|$|Atherosclerosis is {{characterized}} by vascular inflammation and associated with systemic and local immune responses to oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and other antigens. Since immunization with oxLDL reduces atherosclerosis, we hypothesized that the disease might be associated with development of protective immunity. Here we show that spleen-associated immune activity protects against atherosclerosis. Splenectomy dramatically aggravated atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic apoE knockout (apoE°) mice. Transfer of spleen cells from atherosclerotic apoE° mice significantly reduced disease development in young apoE° mice. To identify the protective subset, donor spleen cells were divided into B and T cells by immunomagnetic separation before transfer. Protection was conferred by B cells, which reduced disease in splenectomized apoE° mice to one-fourth of that in splenectomized apoE° controls. Protection could also be demonstrated in intact, nonsplenectomized mice and was associated {{with an increase in}} antibody titers to oxLDL. Fewer CD 4 + T cells were found in lesions of protected mice, suggesting a role for <b>T-B</b> <b>cell</b> cooperation. These results demonstrate that B cell–associated protective immunity develops during atherosclerosis and reduces disease progression...|$|E
