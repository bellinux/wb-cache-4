5|$|After the E.coli outbreak, Odwalla {{improved}} {{the safety of}} several of its production processes. Before the fruit enters the factory, it is washed, sorted and sanitized. Once it has reached the plant, <b>the</b> <b>apples,</b> carrots, and citrus fruits are separated and washed again. The fruit is pressed to get the juice, which is then flash pasteurized and bottled. A sample undergoes quality testing, and, if it passes, the batch is shipped in refrigerated trucks to various distribution centers in the United States. Odwalla juice has a relatively short shelf life compared to other beverages and thus must be refrigerated. However, after the introduction of flash pasteurization in 1996 and a new plastic bottle in 2001, the shelf life has been considerably extended. Generally, Odwalla products are sold in special Odwalla-brand displays at grocery and convenience stores, instead of being intermixed with other products.|$|E

5000|$|By {{the time}} IBM {{released}} the rival IBM PC in 1981, <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> II's technology was already four years old. After <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> III initially struggled, management decided in 1981 that the further continuation of <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> II {{was in the}} company's best interest. After [...] years of <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> II Plus, essentially at a standstill, came {{the introduction of a}} new Apple II model — <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> IIe (codenamed [...] "Diana" [...] and [...] "Super II"). <b>The</b> <b>Apple</b> IIe was released in January 1983, the successor to <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> II Plus. <b>The</b> <b>Apple</b> IIe was <b>the</b> first <b>Apple</b> computer with a custom ASIC chip, which reduced much of the old discrete IC-based circuitry to a single chip, reducing cost {{and the size of the}} motherboard. Some of the hardware features of <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> III (e.g. bank-switched memory) were borrowed in the design of <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> IIe, and some from incorporating <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> II Plus Language card. The culmination of these changes led to increased sales and greater market share of home, education and small business use.|$|R
5|$|In the 1990s the Elephant 6 collective, {{including}} {{acts like}} <b>The</b> <b>Apples</b> in Stereo, The Olivia Tremor Control, Neutral Milk Hotel, Elf Power and of Montreal, produced eclectic psychedelic rock and folk. Other alternative acts to pursue psychedelia from the 1990s included The Brian Jonestown Massacre, The Dandy Warhols, Kula Shaker and Super Furry Animals. Stoner rock also emerged, combining elements of psychedelic rock, blues-rock and doom metal. Typically using a slow-to-mid tempo and featuring low-tuned guitars in a bass-heavy sound, with melodic vocals, and 'retro' production, it was pioneered by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep. In the UK the Madchester scene influenced the early sound of 1990s Britpop bands like Blur. The Verve mixed on 1960s psychedelia with the shoegazing aesthetic. Oasis also drew on 1960s psychedelic pop and rock. In the immediate post-Britpop era Kula Shaker incorporated swirling, guitar-heavy sounds of late-'60s psychedelia with Indian mysticism and spirituality. In {{the new millennium}} neo-psychedelia was continued by bands directly emulating {{the sounds of the}} 60s such as The Black Angels, Tame Impala, Pond, King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard, Unknown Mortal Orchestra and The Essex Green, while bands like Animal Collective and The Bright Light Social Hour applied an experimental approach that combined genres from the 1960s and the present.M.

While <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> II contributed to the inspirations of several important business products, such as VisiCalc, Multiplan and <b>Apple</b> Writer, <b>the</b> computer's hardware architecture, operating system and developer environment were limited. <b>The</b> <b>Apple</b> III addressed these weaknesses. According to Steve Wozniak, VisiCalc and Disk II had caused <b>the</b> <b>Apple</b> II's popularity, with 90% of sales going to businesses as opposed to the hobbyists that were its original market.

Digory resists, knowing his mother would never condone theft, but hesitates. He sees through the Witch's ploy when she {{suggests}} he leave Polly behind—not knowing Polly can get away by her own ring. Foiled, the Witch departs for the North. Digory returns to Narnia and plants the apple, which grows into a mature tree behind them whilst the coronation proceeds. Aslan tells Digory how the tree works: anyone who steals <b>the</b> <b>apples</b> gets their heart's desire, but {{in a form that}} makes it unlikeable. In the Witch's case, she has achieved immortality, but it only means eternal misery because of her evil heart. Moreover, the magic apples are now a horror to her, such that the apple tree will repel her for centuries to come. With Aslan's permission, Digory then takes an apple from the new tree to heal his mother. Aslan returns Digory, Polly, and Uncle Andrew to England; Frank and his wife, Helen (transported from England by Aslan) stay to rule Narnia as its first King and Queen.|$|E

25|$|Patulin is a {{mycotoxin}} {{produced by}} a variety of molds, in particular, Aspergillus and Penicillium and Byssochlamys. Most commonly found in rotting apples, in general the amount of patulin in apple products is viewed as a measure of the quality of <b>the</b> <b>apples</b> used in production. In addition, patulin has been found in other foods such as grains, fruits, and vegetables. While not considered a particularly potent toxin, {{a number of studies have}} shown patulin to be genotoxic, which has led some to theorize that it may be a carcinogen, although animal studies have remained inconclusive. Patulin has shown antimicrobial properties against some microorganisms. Several countries have instituted patulin restrictions in apple products.
