5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>walking</b> meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|Gait change. Some {{aspects of}} gait {{normally}} change with old age. Gait velocity slows after age 70. Double stance time (i.e., time {{with both feet}} on the ground) also increases with age. Because of gait change, old people sometimes appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>walking</b> on ice.|$|E
500|$|Cave {{paintings}} of extinct European cave lions almost exclusively show hunting animals with no manes. Some suggest this {{as evidence that}} the males of this species were maneless, however, since the hunting usually involved groups of lionesses, this presumption remains unproven. In the Chauvet cave, there is a sketchy drawing of two maneless lions, appearing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>walking</b> side by side. One is mostly obscured behind the other. One researcher interpreted this as [...] "a pair" [...] and asserts his perception that the larger of the two animals, the mostly obscured one, shows a scrotum. Again, this is a very individual interpretation, without any consensus among experts examining the sketch. So no conclusion may be drawn scientifically.|$|E

500|$|At 1 {{o'clock on}} Saturday 14 April, the steamers began leaving Circular Quay, {{conveying}} 8,000 {{of an estimated}} 10,000-strong crowd to Middle Harbour – a large crowd considering the alternative attractions that day of Sydney Royal Easter Show (known then simply as [...] "the Exhibition") and horse racing. The remainder were reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>walking</b> from St Leonards, with a [...] being collected along the way. Spectators clambered {{up the sides of}} the bay for vantage points, while hundreds more stayed on board steamboats, yachts and in row boats below. The rope was strung across the entrance to Willoughby Bay, from Folly Point {{to the head of the}} bay, a reported length of , [...] above the waters below. The distance meant that two ropes were required, spliced together in the centre, to reach the other side, with 16 stays fixed to the shore and into the harbour to steady the structure.|$|E
500|$|During the 1951–1952 season, {{the program}} was {{broadcast}} from a converted NBC radio studio. The {{first year of the}} television show was done live; this led to problems as there was not enough time for costume changes; Skelton was on camera for most of the half-hour, including the delivery of a commercial which was written into one of the show's skits. In early 1952, Skelton had an idea for a television sketch about someone who had been drinking not being able to know which way is up. [...] The script was completed and he had the show's production crew build a set that was perpendicular to the stage, so it would give the illusion that someone was walking on walls. [...] The skit, starring his character Willie Lump-Lump, called for the character's wife to hire a carpenter to re-do the living room in an effort to teach her husband a lesson about his drinking. [...] When Willie wakes up there after a night of drinking, he realizes he is not lying on the floor but on the living room wall. [...] Willie's wife goes about the house normally, but to Willie, she appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>walking</b> on a wall. [...] Within an hour after the broadcast, the NBC switchboard had received 350 calls regarding the show, and Skelton had received more than 2,500 letters about the skit within a week of its airing.|$|E
2500|$|The Greenwich Village townhouse {{explosion}} {{occurred on}} March 6, 1970, in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of the New York City borough of Manhattan. It {{was caused by}} the premature detonation of a bomb that was being assembled by members of the Weather Underground, an American radical left group. The bomb was under construction in the basement of 18 West 11th Street, when it accidentally exploded; the blast reduced the four-story townhouse to a burning, rubble-strewn ruin. The two persons preparing the bomb were killed instantly (Diana Oughton and Terry Robbins), as was a third [...] "Weatherman" [...] who happened <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>walking</b> into the townhouse (Ted Gold); two others were injured but were helped from the scene and later escaped (Kathy Boudin and Cathy Wilkerson).|$|E

2500|$|The Mella {{assassination}} {{illustrates the}} complexity of those times and demonstrates Vidali and his [...] "manager's" [...] skill at obfuscation and covering his tracks. Officially José Agustín López (said to have no particular political affiliations) was charged with Mella's murder, but two other known killers, José Magriñat and Antonio Sanabría, were also suspected. The police investigating this crime were given conflicting eyewitness reports. In one version, Mella and Modotti were walking alone, in another Vidali was said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>walking</b> with Mella and Tina Modotti. Since Mella's wounds were from point blank range, neither Modotti or Vidali were injured, and Modotti gave a false name to the investigators, the police were suspicious of her alibi. Modotti was arrested, but soon released. Magriñat, who had also been arrested, was then released. Apparently a loose end, he was ultimately killed in Cuba by Communists in 1933 (Albers, 2002).|$|E

60|$|The {{next morning}} Dora Bannister, {{in an open}} carriage, drawn by the family bays, {{appeared}} {{at the door of}} the Witton mansion.

She hurried forward, for she knew very well that Dora had not come to call on the Wittons.|$|R
