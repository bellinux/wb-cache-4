5|$|The oldest graves are to {{the north}} of the church, which is unusual: ordinarily the {{southern}} part of the churchyard would be used first for burials, with the northern part remaining unconsecrated unless and until extra space for graves was required. The path between the road and the church has sunken, which may partly be explained by the medieval custom of burying the dead on top of each other. One author has suggested that the mound alongside the path might indicate <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>is</b> located in the site of a Bronze Age settlement.|$|E
5|$|The Civil War {{brought with}} it {{the end of the}} {{consensus}} among English Protestants {{that there should be a}} single church imposed by the state, though there was still not complete freedom of religion. The ideals of the dissenting brethren of the Assembly were significant in the rise of denominationalism, the doctrine <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>is</b> found in several institutions rather than a single one in a given location. Though Protestants already commonly recognized the validity of churches in different territories, the outcome of the Assembly's debates marks the wider acceptance of the idea that several true churches may be found in the same territory.|$|E

25|$|The Episcopal Church {{is governed}} {{according}} to episcopal polity {{with its own}} system of canon law. This means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>is</b> organized into dioceses led by bishops in consultation with representative bodies. It is a unitary body, in {{that the power of}} the General Convention is not limited by the individual dioceses. The church has, however, a highly decentralized structure and characteristics of a confederation.|$|E
25|$|Communitas Perfecta ("Perfect Community") or Societas Perfecta ("Perfect Society") is the Latin name {{given to}} one of several ecclesiological, canonical, and {{political}} theories of the Catholic Church. The doctrine teaches <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>is</b> a self-sufficient or independent group which already has all the necessary resources and conditions to achieve its overall goal (final end) of the universal salvation of mankind. It has historically been used in order to define Church–State relations {{and to provide a}} theoretical basis for the legislative powers of the church in the philosophy of canon law.|$|E

25|$|Other items {{brought to}} the altar during the Divine Liturgy include a gold or silver chalice with red wine, a small {{metallic}} urn of warm water, a metallic communion spoon, a little metallic spear, a sponge, a metal disk with cut pieces of bread upon it, and a star, which is a star-shaped piece of metal over which the priest places a cloth covering when transporting the holy gifts {{to and from the}} altar. Also found on the altar table is the antimins. The antimins is a silk cloth, signed by the appropriate diocesan bishop, upon which the sanctification of the holy gifts takes place during each Divine Liturgy. The antimins contain the relics of a saint. When a church is consecrated by a bishop, there is a formal service or prayers and sanctification {{in the name of the}} Saint <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>is</b> named after. The bishop will also often present a small relic of a saint to place in or on the altar as part of the consecration of a new church.|$|E
25|$|Cross used in Marthoma Church Chancel {{particularly}} {{at the center of}} the Altar is the Easter Cross. In Marthoma worship practice the visual Sign of the Cross is used many times. When the Priest gives the blessing he performs the sign of the cross; the worshipers, as a sign of accepting the blessing also reciprocates blessing oneself. The same is done at the time of the declaration of the Trinity and also at the time of indication of the Cross. Generally iconostases, pictures or statues of saints are not kept in Marthoma churches. Until the middle of the 20th century, all worshipers were seated on a mat spread on the floor. Children occupy the first rows and behind them on right side females and towards left males are seated. A narrow space between left and right is demarcated with a red carpet starting from the main door signifying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>is</b> sharing the worship space of heaven and joining the communion. Now many churches provide chairs or benches. During the Passion week services, chairs are removed, to facilitate worshiping according to their ancient custom, which includes prostrating a number of times. Everyone including clergy and the laity, who take part in the worship, faces east for the service.|$|E
500|$|Cusack {{states that}} the Church [...] "must be accorded {{the status of a}} {{functional}} equivalent of religion, at the very least, if not 'authentic' religion". She sees it as [...] "arguably a legitimate path to liberation", citing its culture jamming and activism against commercialism. Kirby posits <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>is</b> a religion masquerading as a joke, rather than the reverse: in her view, it is a spiritual manifestation of a cultural shift toward irony. Alberts believes that there is broad agreement <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>is</b> fundamentally a different type of group than religions that date to antiquity; he prefers to use the term [...] "fake religion" [...] to describe the group. He sees it, along with Discordianism, as {{part of a group of}} [...] "popular movements that look and feel like religion, but whose apparent excess, irreverence and arbitrariness seem to mock religion". Knight characterizes the Church as [...] "at once a postmodern spoof of religion and a viable system in its own right".|$|E

500|$|All Saints' Church is {{recorded}} in the National Heritage List for England as a GradeII* listed building, having been designated on 7 December 1965.

50|$|A local legend, first {{recorded}} in the eighteenth century, holds <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> burial place of the legendary King Lucius, first Christian king of Britain, who {{was said to have}} established a bishopric in Gloucester in the second century A.D. This legend combined with the results of the archaeological work has apparently inspired <b>the</b> local belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>was</b> built on <b>the</b> site of an ancient Roman temple, and <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first Christian <b>church</b> in Britain.|$|R

500|$|There is {{disagreement}} among external sources {{regarding the}} christology of La Luz del Mundo. According to theologian Roger S. Greenway, the Church is trinitarian but baptizes {{in the name}} of Jesus to conform to apostolic practice. Theological librarian Kenneth D. Gill agrees with Greenway <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Church</b> <b>is</b> trinitarian, and says it refuses to [...] "use the term 'person' to describe the three modes of God." [...] Sociocultural anthropologist Hugo G. Nutini also says the Church is trinitarian but that its worship focuses exclusively on Jesus Christ as the source of salvation.|$|E
500|$|A 2006 {{guide to}} the churches of Anglesey {{says that it is}} [...] "of fairly unusual appearance, not at all typical of Anglesey churches in its {{stonework}} or the shape of the castelled tower". [...] It comments that the organ and vestry were in [...] "unusually-shaped rooms", and notes the [...] "ornate stained glass" [...] of the Ascension. A 2009 {{guide to the}} buildings of the region says <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>is</b> [...] "bolder" [...] than John Welch's similarly designed church at Llandudno. It describes the tower as [...] "top-heavy with battlements...like a water tower", and adds that the seating is [...] "crowded".|$|E
500|$|The {{church has}} {{national}} recognition and statutory protection from unauthorised alteration {{as it has}} been designated as a Grade II listed building, which is the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating [...] "buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them". It was given this status on 30 January 1968 and has been listed as [...] "a simple rural church of the 19th century". Cadw, the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists, also comments <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> <b>is</b> [...] "particularly notable for retention of early carved stonework in the later fabric." ...|$|E
