Green watched Denny's assault live on {{television}} and rushed to the scene. Upon arriving, he found Denny had climbed back into the cab of his truck and was attempting to drive away, but was unable <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> because he was drifting {{in and out of}} consciousness. Green moved Denny out of the driver's seat and drove him to Daniel Freeman Hospital in Inglewood. Upon arriving at the hospital Denny went into a seizure.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the Bullets drafted two future Hall of Fame members: Earl Monroe, in the 1967 draft, number two overall, and Wes Unseld, in the 1968 draft, also number two overall. The team {{improved}} dramatically, from 36 wins the previous season to 57 in the 1968–69 season, and Unseld received both the {{rookie of the}} year and MVP awards. The Bullets reached the playoffs with high expectations <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>far,</b> but they were eliminated by the New York Knicks in the first round. The next season the two teams met again in the first round, and although this one went to seven games, the Knicks emerged victorious again.|$|E

The park was established by 1923 as [...] "Upper Pine Bottom Class B Public Camp", and named for the stream that flows through it. Class B camps were on secondary highways and were [...] "used primarily by hikers, hunters, fishermen, vacationists, and picknickers who desire <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> {{into the woods and}} make their stay comfortable". Each Class B camp had a lean-to shelter for camping, potable water, picnic tables, a fireplace, garbage can, and a latrine. There was no charge to use any of the camps, but stays were limited to two consecutive nights.|$|E

500|$|Folk metal {{has been}} {{associated}} with paganism ever since its inception, when Martin Walkyier left his former band Sabbat to form Skyclad, in part because the band [...] "wasn't going <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> enough down the pagan, British way that we wanted to do it." [...] Consequently, the lyrics of Skyclad have been known to deal with pagan matters. The band Cruachan was also founded by a self-described pagan, Keith Fay. For Ville Sorvali of Moonsorrow, the label [...] "pagan metal" [...] is preferred [...] "because that describes the ideological points in the music, but doesn’t say anything about the music itself." [...] Other bands that also prefer to use the term [...] "pagan metal" [...] as a self-description include Cruachan, Eluveitie, Obtest and Skyforger. In contrast to bands with pagan themes, some folk metal bands such as Orphaned Land have themes of Abrahamic religion.|$|E

500|$|The term {{trade winds}} {{originally}} {{derives from the}} early fourteenth century late Middle English word 'trade,' meaning [...] "path" [...] or [...] "track." [...] The Portuguese {{recognized the importance of}} the trade winds (then the Volta do mar, meaning in Portuguese [...] "turn of the sea" [...] but also [...] "return from the sea") in navigation in both the north and south Atlantic ocean as early as the 15th century. [...] From West Africa, the Portuguese had to sail away from continental Portugal, that is, to west and northwest. They could then turn northeast, to the area around the Azores islands, and finally east to mainland Europe. They also learned that to reach South Africa, they needed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> out in the ocean, head for Brazil, and around 30°S go east again. Following the African coast southbound means upwind in the Southern hemisphere.|$|E

2500|$|The next day, Wild {{wrote to}} David Hill, the chief {{executive}} of State Rail Authority (SRA): [...] he described his XPT experience and asked, [...] "Can we help in any way to improve things?". [...] Then at a meeting Hill arranged in February 1984, having researched by then the French and Japanese high-speed rail systems (of which he had been only distantly aware when he had taken his journey), Wild and two colleagues discussed the potential for much higher speeds with SRA executives. But despite the cordiality, it became apparent that such a project was unlikely <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> under the umbrella of the SRA.

Cuomo concluded that [...] "These e-mails show that persons in the governor's office did not merely produce records under a Freedom of Information Act and request, but were instead engaged in planning and producing media coverage concerning Senator Bruno's travel on state aircraft before any FOIL request was made." [...] It also suggests that the governor's staff lied {{when they tried to}} explain what they had done and forced the State Police <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> beyond their normal procedures in documenting Bruno's whereabouts.|$|E

2500|$|<b>To</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> {{beyond the}} Feferman-Schütte ordinal, {{one needs to}} {{introduce}} new methods. [...] Unfortunately there is not yet any standard way to do this: every author in the subject seems to have invented their own system of notation, and it is quite hard to translate between the different systems. The first such system was introduced by Bachmann in 1950 (in an ad hoc manner), and different extensions and variations of it were described by Buchholz, Takeuti (ordinal diagrams), Feferman (θ systems), Aczel, Bridge, Schütte, and Pohlers. However most systems use the same basic idea, of constructing new countable ordinals by using the existence of certain uncountable ordinals.

I was scratching a little bit, but mostly keys, because my role in this band has kind of evolved. So to pick up a new instrument and learn it in a few years was hard to do. [...] I’m really serious and focused about it, that’s what the rehearsals are for, hitting all those wrong notes.

2500|$|In 1995 FACTNet was {{featured}} in the news due to a lawsuit regarding the seizure of FACTNet servers and files by the Religious Technology Center (RTC), a sub-organization of the Church of Scientology created to oversee the protection of its trademarks and copyrights. In August 1995 RTC lawyers went to a Denver judge alleging copyright infringement and illegal use of Scientology documents by FACTNet, a vocal critic of the organization's practices. [...] A raid of two directors' homes was conducted on August 21, 1995 by two U.S. marshals and six RTC representatives, with the actual search for incriminating documents conducted by the RTC alone. [...] Witnesses of the searches testified that the marshals allowed the RTC representatives <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> {{beyond the scope of}} the order in their search for information. [...] The marshals also failed to search the representatives before or after the search, making it possible for them to carry off disks and other documents containing critical information. [...] FACTNet immediately accused the Church of Scientology of attempting to silence their voice by stealing and contaminating information vital to their continued attacks and lawsuits against the Church. [...] The raids provoked debate both on the internet and in the university setting, with university protesters in Denver, Colorado holding signs that read: [...] "Hands Off the Internet" [...] and [...] "Scientology Harasses Critics," [...] while counterprotesters at the Boulder County Courthouse carried signs such as: [...] "Only criminals spread lawlessness on the Internet." ...|$|E

[...] She was famous for her slogan, [...] "Think like a man, act like a lady, and work like a dog." [...] Ichiko managed {{to rise to the}} top of the department store industry by working extensive overtime hours, while reporting she'd left at the designated quitting time, so the company would not have to pay her overtime. [...] In this manner, she was able to prove her worth to the company without being an economic drain on them. [...] She used her female perspective to boost sales in kitchenware departments; while initiating bold new ideas and change along the way. [...] Ichiko is one of the most prominent career women, working as hard, or harder, than the typical salaryman, while using her skills over seniority to advance. [...] She was able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>far</b> in the department store business because in the 1980s, it was realized that even if housewives didn't work, they were largely in charge of the family budget and marketing to them would be wiser than the [...] "For men only" [...] idea of business. [...] Using a feminine perspective to appeal to female clients, while putting in the effort of working massive hours of unpaid overtime, Ichiko was able to prosper from her skill in a system based on seniority that frequently discriminated against women. [...] While this path of career woman is much more arduous than the part-time or temp work that many women seek and offers little real promise of reward, it is a testament to the power of a career woman, to beat the system.|$|E
