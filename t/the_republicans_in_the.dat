5|$|During {{the final}} {{part of his}} career, Tzara {{combined}} his humanist and anti-fascist perspective with a communist vision, joining <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Civil War and the French Resistance during World War II, and serving a term in the National Assembly. Having spoken in favor of liberalization in the People's Republic of Hungary just before the Revolution of 1956, he distanced himself from the French Communist Party, {{of which he was}} by then a member. In 1960, he was among the intellectuals who protested against French actions in the Algerian War.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, with <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> majority, McKinley sought {{election}} as Speaker of the House. He failed {{to gain the}} post, which went to Thomas B. Reed of Maine; however, Speaker Reed appointed McKinley chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. The Ohioan guided the McKinley Tariff of 1890 through Congress; although McKinley's work was altered through the influence of special interests in the Senate, it imposed a number of protective tariffs on foreign goods.|$|E
5|$|The mid-term {{elections}} in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor {{with the administration}} over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of habeas corpus, the military draft law, and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest.|$|E

When his grandson Hamilton Fish V ran for a Westchester County congressional district as a Democrat <b>in</b> 1988, <b>the</b> elder Fish derided his grandson as a communist and contributed $100 to <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> race.|$|R
5|$|Due {{in large}} part to surplus {{revenues}} from the tariffs, federal spending reached one billion dollars for the first time during his term. The spending issue in part led to the defeat of <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1890 mid-term elections. Cleveland defeated Harrison for re-election in 1892, due to the growing unpopularity of the high tariff and high federal spending. Harrison returned to private life and his law practice in Indianapolis. In 1899 Harrison represented the Republic of Venezuela in their British Guiana boundary dispute against the United Kingdom. Harrison traveled to the court of Paris as part of the case and after a brief stay returned to Indianapolis. He died at his home in Indianapolis in 1901 of complications from influenza. Although many have praised Harrison's commitment to African Americans' voting rights, scholars and historians generally regard his administration as below-average, and rank him in the bottom half among U.S. presidents. Historians, however, have not questioned Harrison's commitment to personal and official integrity.|$|E
5|$|Legislative chaos ensued as Taylor {{refused to}} {{acknowledge}} the Assembly's decision and vacate the governorship. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> legislature obeyed Taylor's orders, while the Democrats ignored Taylor and followed the orders of their leadership. Finally, on February 21, 1900, Taylor and Beckham agreed to let the courts settle the matter. The case first went before the Louisville Circuit Court, which found in favor of Beckham. Republicans appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, {{at that time the}} court of last resort in the state. On April 6, 1900, the Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of the lower court. Taylor appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which declined to hear the case on May 21, 1900. Taylor's only supporter on the court was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan.|$|E

25|$|On December 14, 1859, the U.S. Senate {{appointed}} a bipartisan committee {{to investigate the}} Harpers Ferry raid and to determine whether any citizens contributed arms, ammunition or money to John Brown's men.

25|$|With {{the help}} of the Bureau, the {{recently}} freed slaves began voting, forming political parties, and assuming the control of labor in many areas. The Bureau helped to start a change of power in the South that drew national attention from <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> North to the conservative Democrats in the South. This is especially evident in the election between Grant and Seymour (Johnson did not get the Democratic nomination), where almost 700,000 black voters voted and swayed the election 300,000 votes in Grant's favor.|$|E

25|$|Senator Jay Rockefeller, {{great-grandson}} of oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller, {{sought a}} fifth term representing West Virginia. Even though West Virginia is a historically Democratic state, {{in which the}} party had a 50-32% edge in party affiliation over <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2004 elections, the state party is more conservative than the national party, giving its votes to President George W.

The Republican nominee was Jay Wolfe of Salem, a former State Senator.|$|E
25|$|Ironically, Blaine {{was from}} the reform wing of his own party, but the Mugwumps {{rejected}} his candidacy. This division among Republicans {{may have contributed to}} the victory in 1884 of Grover Cleveland, the first president elected from the Democratic party since the Civil War. In the period from 1876 to 1892, presidential elections were closely contested at the national level, but the states themselves were mostly dominated by a single party, with Democrats prevailing in the South and <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Northeast. Although the defection of the Mugwumps may have helped Cleveland win in New York, one of the few closely contested states, historians attribute Cleveland's victory nationwide to the rising power of urban immigrant voters.|$|E
