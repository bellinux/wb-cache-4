5|$|Solutions {{of copper}} {{compounds}} {{are used as}} a wood preservative, particularly in treating the original portion of structures during restoration of dry rot damage. Together with zinc, copper wires may be installed over non-conductive roofing materials to discourage the growth of moss. <b>Textile</b> <b>fibers</b> are blended with copper to create antimicrobial protective fabrics. Copper alloys are used in musical instruments, particularly: the body of brass instruments; circuitry for all those that are electronically amplified; the bodies of brass percussion such as gongs, bells, and kettle drums; tuning heads on guitars and other string instruments; string windings on harps, pianos, harpsichords, and string instruments; and the frame elements of pianos and harps. Copper is commonly used as a base on which other metals such as nickel are electroplated.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, the {{labeling}} of garments came into law under the <b>Textile</b> <b>Fiber</b> Products Identification Act (TFPIA). The act itself imposes regulations on the advertising and {{labeling of}} <b>textile</b> <b>fiber</b> {{products that are}} being imported and exported out of the United States. These products are defined in the act as, “any fiber, yarn, or fabric used or intended for use in household textile articles”. [...] Household textile articles include “wearing apparel, costumes, draperies, floor coverings, furnishings, and bedding”. [...] The goal of the <b>Textile</b> <b>Fiber</b> Product Identification Act is to protect producers and consumers against mislabeling or false advertising about the <b>fiber</b> content of <b>textile</b> <b>fiber</b> products. It wasn’t until 1984 that the TFPIA was amended to include items made in The United States stating that they were “Made in U.S.A”.|$|R

25|$|Lint is {{the common}} name for visible accumulations of <b>textile</b> <b>fibers</b> and other {{materials}}, usually found on and around clothing. Certain materials used {{in the manufacture of}} clothing, such as cotton, linen, and wool, contain numerous, very short fibers bundled together. During the course of normal wear, these fibers may either detach or be jostled out of the weave of which they are part. This is the reason that heavily used articles like shirts and towels become thin over time, and why these particles collect in the lint screen of a clothes dryer.|$|E
25|$|Black {{light is}} used {{extensively}} in non-destructive testing. Fluorescing fluids {{are applied to}} metal structures and illuminated with a black light which allows cracks and other weaknesses in the material to be easily detected. It {{is also used to}} illuminate pictures painted with fluorescent colors, particularly on black velvet, which intensifies the illusion of self-illumination. The use of such materials, often in the form of tiles viewed in a sensory room under UV light, is common in the United Kingdom for the education of students with profound and multiple learning difficulties. Such fluorescence from certain <b>textile</b> <b>fibers,</b> especially those bearing optical brightener residues, can also be used for recreational effect, as seen, for example, in the opening credits of the James Bond film A View to a Kill. Black light puppetry is also performed in a black light theater.|$|E

50|$|Jute {{was used}} in {{traditional}} <b>textile</b> machinery as <b>fibers</b> having cellulose (vegetable fiber content) and lignin (wood fiber content). But, the major breakthrough came when the automobile, pulp and paper, and the furniture and bedding industries started to use jute and its allied fibers with their non-woven and composite technology to manufacture nonwovens, technical textiles, and composites. Therefore, jute has changed its <b>textile</b> <b>fiber</b> outlook and steadily heading towards its newer identity, i.e., wood <b>fiber.</b> As a <b>textile</b> <b>fiber,</b> jute has reached its peak from {{where there is no}} hope of progress, but as a wood fiber jute has many promising features.|$|R

2500|$|Heat and {{humidity}} can both contribute and a textile’s deterioration. [...] However, excessive dryness may also cause damage, especially to elastic fibers, such as wool, which rely on some amount of moisture {{to maintain their}} flexibility (Putnam and Finch). [...] Additionally, temperature {{and humidity}} should be kept as constant as possible; changes in either of these may cause the <b>textile</b> <b>fibers</b> to expand and contract, which, over time, can also cause damage and deterioration to the textile. [...] For this reason, both storage and display areas should be fitted with monitoring equipment to gauge the temperature and humidity of rooms, display cases, enclosed storage facilities, and work areas.|$|E
2500|$|Important changes {{occurred}} in several specific trade categories in the 1970s and 1980s. Imports of <b>textile</b> <b>fibers</b> rose from 5.8 percent in 1975 to 10.7 percent in 1980 as the Chinese textile industry grew faster than domestic cotton supplies but then fell to 4 percent in 1985 as domestic cotton production increased. Imports of unfinished textile products also increased from 1.3 percent in 1975 to 5.3 percent in 1985 {{as a result}} of textile industry growth. Iron and steel accounted for approximately 20 percent of imports in the 1970s, fell to 11.6 percent in 1980, then rose to 14.9 percent in 1985. Imports of manufactured goods, machinery, and transportation equipment represented 62.6 percent of total import value in 1975, fell to 53.9 percent in 1980 as imports were cut back during the [...] "period of readjustment" [...] of the economy (1979–81), and rose again to 75.2 percent in 1985. On the export side, the share of foodstuffs fell to 12.5 percent in 1985. The fastest growing export item in the 1970s was petroleum, which was first exported in 1973. Petroleum rocketed to 12.1 percent of all exports in 1975, 22 percent in 1980, and 21.2 percent in 1985. In the 1980s textile exports grew rapidly. Although exports of unfinished textiles remained about 14 percent of total exports, all categories of textile exports rose from 5 percent in 1975 to 18.7 percent in 1984. In 1986 textiles replaced petroleum as China's largest single export item.|$|E

Innovation and application of <b>textile</b> <b>fiber</b> technology will be closely connected with future research on environmental biotechnology. In contemporary society, biotechnology is expected to resolve various problems, from basic necessities of life to social production. Significant changes have taken place in many aspects, including energy, climate and environment, etc. of the earth, which we need to survive at present. Therefore, development of renewable, environmental and low energy textile products, which meet social requirements, becomes a trend of social development in future.
