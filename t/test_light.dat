This repeated by approaching the center of vision from different directions. Repeating this enough will establish a boundary of vision for that target.

40|$|We discuss tting a semiparametric model {{based on}} two sources of information, which is {{motivated}} by a rat sleep dataset. In a recent study, rats were exposed to two dierent lighting conditions. The rst, baseline condition, was a standard 24 -hour schedule of 12 hours lights on followed by 12 hours lights o; the second, test condition, exposed rats to a continuous 3 hours lights on / 3 hours lights o schedule. Rat sleep {{was believed to be}} aected mainly by the circadian rhythm under the baseline lighting condition and by both the circadian rhythm and <b>light</b> under the <b>test</b> <b>lighting</b> condition. In this article, we suggest tting a nonparametric model for the dataset under the baseline lighting condition. For the dataset under the <b>test</b> <b>lighting</b> condition, a two-part model is suggested. The rst part equals an unknown coecient multiplied by the nonparametric function used for modeling the dataset under the baseline lighting condition, explaining the remnant of the circadian rhythm under the <b>test</b> <b>lighting</b> condition. The second part is a periodic nonparametric function which would explain the eect of the <b>test</b> <b>lighting</b> condition. This modeling procedure can be used to model other physiological parameters aected by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors.

5000|$|A <b>test</b> <b>light,</b> test lamp, voltage tester, or mains tester is {{a simple}} piece of {{electronic}} test equipment {{used to determine the}} presence or absence of an electric voltage (usually alternating current (AC) in a piece of equipment under test. A <b>test</b> <b>light</b> is generally simpler and less costly than a measuring instrument such as a multimeter, and often suffices for checking for the presence of voltage on a conductor. Properly designed test lights include features to protect the user from accidental electric shock. Non-contact test lights can detect voltage on insulated conductors.|$|E

Collimated monochromatic light is often used in op-tical metrology. The error of collimation will influ-ence the resulting measurement and reduce the accuracy of measurement. Therefore an easy and simple method to check the quality of collimation of the light is important. Several papers ` 5 for check-ing collimation of the light beam have been pub-lished that are based on the Talbot effect and moir 6 technique. Although these studies used simple and easily adjustable setups, the resultant moir 6 fringes are in linear distribution in spite of the convergence of the light because they all used linear gratings...|$|R

"Timing advance" [...] {{refers to}} the number of degrees before top dead center (BTDC) that the spark will ignite the air-fuel mixture in the {{combustion}} chamber during the compression stroke.

The Foucault test is in use to this date, most notably by amateur and smaller commercial telescope makers as it is inexpensive and uses simple, easily made equipment.|$|E
