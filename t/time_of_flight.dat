5|$|For many {{practical}} purposes, {{light and}} other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and very sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects.

5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight.</b> To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E

40|$|International audienceUltrasonic non {{destructive}} testing consists in emitting an acoustic wave in a material and then locating the reflected echoes produced by impedance changes, due to flaws or medium discontinuities. In some cases, echoes can overlap in the A-scan (typically for layered materials), yielding a difficult analysis: techniques such as matched filtering may fail and advanced techniques are necessary to locate the echoes. Sparse deconvolution methods have been recently applied to such problems. The challenge is to estimate a sparse sequence composed by the echoes locations (<b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>flight)</b> and amplitudes. Usually, deconvolution is addressed by considering restoration at the acquisition sampling scale. This limits the precision of the spike location and may cause spike splitting. In this paper, we consider a high-resolution formulation of the deconvolution problem with a more precise restoration grid. To do so, we extend the approach proposed by Soussen et al. (IEEE Trans. Signal. Process, 2011) which minimizes a data misfit least-square criterion, penalized by a L 0 -norm term. The method has been tested on synthetic and experimental data.
