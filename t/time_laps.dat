50|$|The muscle {{cells are}} the largest cells in the body with a volume {{thousands}} of times larger than most other body cells. To support this large volume, the muscle cells {{are one of the}} very few in the mammalian body that contain several cell nuclei. Such multinucleated cells are called syncytia. Strength-training increases muscle mass and force mainly by changing the caliber of each fiber rather than increasing the number of fibers. During such fiber enlargement muscle stem cells in the muscle tissue multiply and fuse with pre-existing fibers as to support the larger cellular volume. It has often been assumed that each nucleus can support a certain volume of cytoplasm, and hence that there is a constant volume domain served by each nucleus, although recent evidence suggests that this is an oversimplification. Until recently it was believed that during muscle wasting (atrophy) muscle cells lost nuclei by a nuclear self-destruct mechanism called apoptosis, but recent observations using <b>time</b> <b>laps</b> in vivo imaging in mice do not support this model. Direct observation indicated that no nuclei are lost under such conditions, and the apoptosis observed in the muscle tissue were demonstrated to occur only in other cell nuclei in the tissue, e.g. connective tissue and muscle stem cells called satellite cells. Since in vivo imaging has confirmed that cell nuclei are added during strength training and not lost upon subsequent detraining, the nuclei might provide a mechanism for muscle memory. Thus, upon retraining the extra nuclei are already there and can rapidly start synthesizing new protein to build muscle mass and strength.|$|E

The {{discordance}} between {{extremely high}} seroprevalence of Taenia solium antibodies in disease-endemic populations, relatively few symptomatic cases of neurocysticercosis, and high background levels of putatively inactive brain lesions (mainly calcifications) in seronegative controls have confused researchers, clinicians, and epidemiologists {{in the last}} decade. We reviewed longitudinal serologic data from general population serosurveys in 3 different disease-endemic areas of Peru and Colombia and found that 40 % of seropositive people were seronegative when resampled after 1 year (3 surveys) or after 3 years (1 survey).

40|$|Abstract: Mannoproteins, as {{the main}} {{constituents}} of the outer layer of yeast cell walls, are able to interact with phagocytic cells in an opsoninindependent manner through the mannose receptor (MR) and to induce yeast ingestion by the professional phagocytes. Moreover, the MR also mediates endocytosis of soluble ligands through clathrin-coated pits. Here, we studied {{some aspects of the}} interaction between the MR and Candida albicans using murine E-clone macrophages and the consequences on MR trafficking. Using a pulldown assay involving mixture E-clone macrophage detergent lysate with mannosylated Sepharose beads and glutaraldehyde-fixed, heat-killed (HK) C. albicans, we found that binding of solubilized MR to mannosylated particles occurred with characteristics similar to the receptor’s cell-surface mannose-binding activity. We then demonstrated that MR expressed on E-clone macrophages contributed to phagocytosis of unopsonized, HK C. albicans and that yeast phagocytosis induced a decrease in MR endocytic activity without concomitant degradation of the receptor in the <b>time</b> <b>laps...</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Sensory, motor, and {{autonomic}} neuropathy {{has been}} reported after electrical injury. Besides subclinical involvement of the sympathetic nervous system during the 1 st year post injury, late clinical manifestations of this involvement have been reported sporadically. This {{study was designed to}} investigate how the clinical and electrodiagnostic manifestations of sympathetic involvement would change with time in electricity victims. Methods and materials: Sixty electrically burnt patients were followed for 22 months with sympathetic skin response (SSR) and autonomic system derangement symptom surveillance. Results: Thirty-one patients reported autonomic derangement symptoms during the 2 nd year post injury. SSR latency prolongation showed direct negative correlation with time; but SSR amplitude was decreased in all cases irrespective of the <b>time</b> <b>laps.</b> Symptomatic patients showed significantly lower SSR amplitudes compared to asymptomatic ones. This was true for the pre-symptom SSR test results too. Conclusion: SSR amplitude {{can be used as a}} predictive test for the symptoms of autonomic derangement to occur post electrical injury.

40|$|Stress {{in plants}} can be {{measured}} using chlorophyll fluorescence imaging. The development of patterns in time can give {{an indication of the}} type of stress. Since leaves grow and show leaf movements, there is no pixel to pixel correspondence in <b>time</b> <b>laps</b> imaging data. In this article, Penalized Likelihood Warping and Robust Point Matching methods for recovering the pixel to pixel correspondence of a leaf within a time series are studied. It is shown that Robust Point Matching method is more suitable for our application than Penalized Likelihood Warping. Furthermore, Robust Point Matching method is much faster than Penalized Likelihood Warping. After warping an image sequence of a cabbage leaf infected with the bacteria Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, it was possible to identify infected spots 30 h after infection, where in unwarped images differences just can be seen 60 h after infection. Time series of the warped image data can be used to study and measure stress patterns in order to detect and identify diseases at an early stage...|$|E
40|$|Inflation universally {{produces}} classical almost scale free Gaussian inhomogeneities of {{any light}} scalars. Assuming the coupling constants {{at the time}} of inflation depend on some light moduli fields, we encounter the generation of modulated cosmological fluctuations from (p) reheating. This is an alternative mechanism to generate observable (almost) scale free adiabatic metric perturbations. We extend this idea to the class of hybrid inflation, where the bifurcation value of the inflaton is modulated by the spatial inhomogeneities of the couplings. As a result, the symmetry breaking after inflation occurs not simultaneously in space but with the <b>time</b> <b>laps</b> in different Hubble patches inherited from the long-wavelength moduli inhomogeneities. To calculate modulated fluctuations we introduce techniques of general relativistic matching conditions for metric perturbations at the time hypersurface where the equation of state after inflation undergoes a jump, without evoking the detailed microscopic physics, as far as it justifies the jump. We apply this theory to the modulated fluctuations from the hybrid and chaotic inflations. We discuss what distinguish the modulated from the inflation-driven fluctuations, in particular, their spectral index, modification of the consistency relation and the issue of weak non-Gaussianity.

To describing life cycle of observed culture, cell division, fusion or comunication, both automaticaly or semiautomaticaly evaulation, is crucial to guarantee optimal camera settings, in case of observing long time experiment run by digital capture device. Monolayer of human cells – often vaguely referred as tissue culture – is the simplest approximation to the model of an organ from which the cells originate. From a small number of cells the culture is allowed to develop into monolayer and this process is observed under the microscope by a series of camera shots, confocal microscope fluorescence readouts etc. In this paper we describe the analysis of camera RGB channels (in) dependence of the most common system, i. e. HeLa cells observed by phase-contrast image enhancement. In a sense, this type of experiment is available to each medical practitioner or biotechnologist. We have chosen this setup as the most obvious example, yet we found out that even partial analysis of the experiment is sufficiently complicated to exploit the capacity limits of current computer technology.

Recent advances in transgenesis technique have allowed identification of posmitotic living neuroblasts and it appeared that their electrical activity (ionic channels and neurotransmitter receptors) {{is a prerequisite for}} they proper migration and differentiation. Our laboratory has developed a transgenic xenopus line which expresses EGFP under the control of NeuroD promoter and this gave us the possibility to study the properties of EGFP expressing living neuroblasts, either in the context of living tadpole or in brain slices. The spatial expression pattern of NeuroD+ cells in vivo was found to decrease from whole brain expression at stage 40 to restricted areas at stage 48 (olfactory bulb, pallium, optic tectum, cerebellum, rhombencephalon). No colocalization of EGFP and the glial marker SR- 101 was found, confirming that EGFP cells are not astrocytes. Some functional properties of these cells were determined using <b>time</b> <b>laps</b> calcium imaging of acute brain slices with confocal microscopy. NeuroD+ cells were found to exhibit more calcium transients when Mg 2 + was removed from the medium, and this effect is reversed by addition of APV (a NMDA receptor antagonist). Moreover, NeuroD+ cells respond more to bath application of glutamate or NMDA than NeuroD- cells. Taken together, these results suggest that a spontaneous release of glutamate produce calcium transients in NeuroD+ cells, and that activity is triggered by NMDA receptors...|$|E
40|$|Respiratory mucus {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{barriers}} for nanoparticle-based pulmonary delivery systems. This holds true especially for lung diseases like cystic fibrosis, where a very tenacious thick mucus layer hinders particle diffusion to the lung epithelium or the target area. Typically, mean square displacement of particles is used for mobility evaluation. In contrast, our objective is to develop a feasible technique to track directed particle penetration as a prerequisite for efficient pulmonary nanotherapy. Therefore, particle diffusion in artificial mucus was monitored based on confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and particle-mucus interaction was observed. As pharmaceutical relevant and benign materials, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) were prepared by hot-melt emulsification using glyceryl behenate and different stabilizing agents such as poloxamer- 407, tween- 80, and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The diffusion of labeled SLNs in stained artificial sputum representing CF-patient sputum was verified by 3 D <b>time</b> <b>laps</b> imaging. Thus, the effect of coating, particle size and mucus viscosity on nanoparticle diffusion was studied. Using image analysis software "Image J", the total fluorescent signal after 30 min in case of poloxamer-coated SLNs was 5 and 100 folds higher than tween- and PVA-coated SLNs, respectively. Nevertheless, increasing mucus viscosity reduced the diffusion of tween-coated SLNs by a factor of 10. Studying particle-mucus interaction by CLSM can be considered a promising and versatile technique...|$|E
