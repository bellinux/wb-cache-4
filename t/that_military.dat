5|$|During 1942, Allied {{officials}} debated on {{the appropriate}} grand strategy to pursue. All agreed that defeating Germany {{was the primary}} objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany through France. The Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the other hand, argued <b>that</b> <b>military</b> operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. Germany itself {{would be subject to}} a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large-scale armies. Eventually, the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.|$|E
5|$|French Sudan {{originally}} {{formed as}} a set of military outposts {{as an extension of the}} French colony in Senegal. Though the area offered France little economic or strategic gain, the military effectively advocated greater conquest in the region. This was partly due to a fascination with the great empires, such as the Mali Empire and the Songhay Empire that rose to prominence in the area, and partly due to the promotional opportunities <b>that</b> <b>military</b> conquest offered for French military personnel.|$|E

5|$|In the 4th century, the Roman army {{underwent}} a radical restructuring. In {{the rule of}} Diocletian (284–305), the traditional Principate formations of legiones, alae and cohortes {{appear to have been}} broken up into smaller units, many of which bore a variety of new names. Under Constantine I (r. 312–337) it appears <b>that</b> <b>military</b> units were classified into three grades based on strategic role and to some extent quality: palatini, elite units normally part of the exercitus praesentales (imperial escort armies); comitatenses, higher-grade interception forces based in frontier provinces; and limitanei, lower-grade border troops.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe subject of military innovation {{is very popular}} in the United States military today. Innovation is encouraged and fostered in all branches of the service. This thesis takes a step back from specific developments today and looks at modes of innovation. The different forms of innovation explored are technological innovation, i. e. introducing weapons, transportation and/or information technology into the battlefield; organizational innovation, i. e. changing how different pieces of the military relate to each other; and the combination of both technological and organizational innovation. Through a series of historical case studies, this thesis shows <b>that</b> <b>militaries</b> <b>that</b> have innovated only by means of adding new technology have not been very successful in the past. It also shows <b>that</b> <b>militaries</b> <b>that</b> innovate only organizationally often make the changes necessary to develop new concepts of operations and tactics and increase their effectiveness. However, this thesis also finds that innovating both organizationally and technologically is historically the most promising approach, in terms of increasing military power and effectiveness.

5|$|Rape was a {{widespread}} {{phenomenon in the}} East as German soldiers regularly committed violent sexual acts against Soviet women.

Historian Birgit Beck emphasizes <b>that</b> <b>military</b> decrees, which served to authorize wholesale brutality on many levels, essentially destroyed the basis for any prosecution of sexual offenses committed by German soldiers in the East. She also contends that detection of such instances was limited by the fact that sexual violence was often inflicted in the context of billets in civilian housing.|$|E

In addition, a visit planned for October 8 (two days after the scheduled attack) by the Romanian Minister of Defense to Egypt was also publicized by the Ministry of War, and a program for his visit was announced.

Olmos launched a disastrous full-scale frontal assault on the city. As soon as the Spanish attacked, they were ambushed from the rear by over two thousand Uspantek warriors. The Spanish forces were routed with heavy losses; many of their indigenous allies were slain, and many more were captured alive by the Uspantek warriors only to be sacrificed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the western}} {{portion of the}} Cuchumatanes fell to the Spanish, the Ixil and Uspantek Maya were {{sufficiently}} isolated to evade immediate Spanish attention. The Uspantek and the Ixil were allies and in 1529, {{four years after the}} conquest of Huehuetenango, Uspantek warriors were harassing Spanish forces and Uspantán was trying to foment rebellion among the K'iche'. Uspantek activity became sufficiently troublesome that the Spanish decided <b>that</b> <b>military</b> action was necessary. Gaspar Arias, magistrate of Guatemala, penetrated the eastern Cuchumatanes with sixty Spanish infantry and three hundred allied indigenous warriors. By early September he had imposed temporary Spanish authority over the Ixil towns of Chajul and Nebaj.

Arias handed command over to the inexperienced Pedro de Olmos and returned to confront de Orduña. Although his officers advised against it, Olmos launched a disastrous full-scale frontal assault on the city. As soon as the Spanish began their assault they were ambushed from the rear by more than two thousand Uspantek warriors. The Spanish forces were routed with heavy losses; many of their indigenous allies were slain, and many more were captured alive by the Uspantek warriors only to be sacrificed on the altar of their deity Exbalamquen. The survivors who managed to evade capture fought their way back to the Spanish garrison at Q'umarkaj.|$|E

5|$|Aside from {{measures}} in Vietnam, 2,000 Indochinese soldiers returning from service in France were sent on indefinite leave {{and were not}} replaced with new recruits from Vietnam. The reason is put down by historians {{to be due to}} the fact <b>that</b> <b>military</b> discipline in France was less regimented than in Indochina and other colonial garrisons. In colonial units, the colonial military and social order with Frenchmen above their colonised troops was more easily reproduced. Metropolitan officers also treated their Vietnamese subordinates on a more equitable basis, making the Vietnamese less likely to accept the discrimination upon return to Vietnam. Overseas Vietnamese soldiers could become so alienated with their experiences that they became soft targets for communist propaganda. Upon returning home, they attempted to indoctrinate other troops with their Marxist doctrine. This train of thought further reinforced French perception that subversive ideas came from the outside rather than domestically: of the 57 soldiers involved in the mutiny, 17 had served abroad. On the other hand, according to the Thiry report, the proportion of soldiers with foreign service at Yen Bay did not exceed that in other garrisons, so this was not abnormal.|$|E
5|$|Aside from non-military {{problems}} facing the junta, it also came into conflict with the Americans over political strategy, most notably as to whether armed force or politics should {{be the focus of}} efforts to end the communist threat to South Vietnam. Minh, the leading generals and Tho, favored a politically oriented solution, feeling that the deposal of Diệm and Nhu had created new possibilities for ending the insurgency of the National Liberation Front, or Viet Cong, mainly through an outreach program. They thought <b>that</b> <b>military</b> force would not be sufficient for Saigon, and that political means were more effective than using American firepower in making up for this. To the junta leaders, the rapid growth of the insurgency in Diệm's final year was due to it being seen as a rallying point and symbol of opposition to Diệm and Nhu, rather than an endorsement of the communists. The senior junta generals believed that with the Ngô brothers dead, the insurgency was now without its major focus of opposition, and therefore, motivation to operate in a vigorous way. To them, most of the insurgents were non-communist, with heavy elements of Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo religious sects or other opposition that had joined because of passionate anti-Diệm sentiment. Minh thus saw the post-Diệm period as an opportunity for grassroots political strengthening to undercut the NLF support base and force the remainder to integrate into mainstream society due to political realities.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{increase}} in the domestic manufacturing industry {{there was still a}} significant shortfall in many items. In part this was due to the priority <b>that</b> <b>military</b> consumption and production necessarily had over civilian, however, there was also a considerable scarcity of raw materials and other components required for manufacturing. This was due both to the lack of shipping available from the United Kingdom, as well as the limitations placed upon the flow of such goods from Britain due to their own increased requirements. The result of this was inflationary. Domestic prices went up, while the cost of exports was deliberately kept lower than market value in an effort to prevent further inflationary pressures worldwide. As a result, the cost of living for many average Australians was increased considerably.|$|E

5|$|It was {{not until}} the mid-1350s <b>that</b> <b>military</b> {{operations}} on the Continent were resumed on a large scale. In 1356, Edward's eldest son, Edward, the Black Prince, won an important victory in the Battle of Poitiers. The greatly outnumbered English forces not only routed the French, but captured the French king, John II and his youngest son, Philip. After a succession of victories, the English held great possessions in France, the French king was in English custody, and the French central government had almost totally collapsed. There has been a historical debate as to whether Edward's claim to the French crown originally was genuine, or if it was simply a political ploy meant to put pressure on the French government. Regardless of the original intent, the stated claim now seemed to be within reach. Yet a campaign in 1359, meant to complete the undertaking, was inconclusive. In 1360, therefore, Edward accepted the Treaty of Brétigny, whereby he renounced his claims to the French throne, but secured his extended French possessions in full sovereignty.|$|E
5|$|Scholars of {{the late}} army {{have to contend with}} a {{dramatic}} diminution of the epigraphic record in the 3rd and 4th centuries, compared with the 1st and 2nd centuries. diplomas were no longer issued to retiring auxiliaries after 203 (most likely because almost all were already Roman citizens by then). In addition, there was a huge {{reduction in the number of}} tombstones, altars and other dedications by Roman servicemen. Official stamps of military units on building materials (e.g. tiles) are much rarer. But this trend should probably not be seen as indicating a decline in the army's administrative sophistication. Papyrus evidence from Egypt shows <b>that</b> <b>military</b> units continued to keep detailed written records in the 4th century (the vast bulk of which are lost due to organic decomposition). Most likely, the decline in inscriptions is due to changing fashion, in part influenced by the increase in barbarian recruits and the rise of Christianity. The dearth of inscriptions leaves major gaps in our understanding {{of the late}} army and renders many conclusions tentative.|$|E
