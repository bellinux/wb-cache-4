5|$|Eventually, in July 1864, Saraiva's {{persistent}} diplomacy {{moved the}} Uruguayan government {{to agree to}} mediated talks including Edward Thornton (the British resident minister in Buenos Aires), Argentine foreign minister Rufino de Elizalde and Saraiva himself. Initially, the negotiations seemed promising, but soon bogged down. On 4 August, convinced that the government in Montevideo was unwilling to work toward a settlement, a frustrated Saraiva delivered an ultimatum, which the Uruguayans rebuffed. On 10 August, Saraiva informed Aguirre that the Brazilian military commanders would receive orders to begin retaliation, marking <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following {{the change}} in government, Sykes was {{promoted}} into the War Cabinet Secretariat with responsibility for Middle Eastern affairs. In January 1917, despite having previously built a relationship with Moses Gaster, he began looking to meet other Zionist leaders; {{by the end of}} the month he had been introduced to Weizmann and his associate Nahum Sokolow, a journalist and executive of the World Zionist Organization who had moved to Britain at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E
5|$|General Sir Archibald Murray, the {{commander}} of the British Empire forces in Egypt, formed the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) in March 1916 by merging the Force in Egypt, which had protected Egypt since <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> with the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force which had fought at Gallipoli. The role of this new force was to both defend the British Protectorate of Egypt and provide reinforcements for the Western Front. Murray had his headquarters in Cairo to better deal with his multiple responsibilities, although he was at Ismailia during the battle for Romani.|$|E
5|$|In 1405, Balša III, {{supported}} by Jelena, launched a ten-year war against Venice. At <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> Balša managed {{to capture the}} whole Scutari region except for the Scutari fortress. The Venetians offered a 2,000-ducat reward for anyone able to kill both Balša and Jelena.

5|$|On the {{battlefield}} the Jägers provided strong leadership that made disciplined {{action by the}} common White soldiers possible.

At <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> the leadership of the White Guards had little authority over volunteer White Guard platoons and companies, which obeyed only their dominant, local leaders. In the end of February, the Jägers started rapid training of six regiments with conscripts.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> {{the board}} of the {{orchestra}} received a petition from rank and file players protesting about Borsdorf's continued membership of the LSO. Although he had done as much as anyone to found the orchestra, had lived in Britain for 30 years and was married to an Englishwoman, Borsdorf was regarded by some colleagues as an enemy alien and was forced out of the orchestra.|$|E
5|$|Winfield Scott, the {{commanding}} {{general of the}} U.S. Army at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> devised the Anaconda Plan {{to win the war}} with as little bloodshed as possible. His idea was that a Union blockade of the main ports would weaken the Confederate economy; then the capture of the Mississippi River would split the South. Lincoln adopted the plan in terms of a blockade to squeeze to death the Confederate economy, but overruled Scott's warnings that his new army was not ready for an offensive operation because public opinion demanded an immediate attack.|$|E

5|$|With a small {{fleet of}} six U-boats at the {{beginning}} of World War I, two of which were not operational, the Austro-Hungarian Navy acted to bolster its fleet. They reluctantly ordered four U-20 boats in 1915 because construction could start immediately, even though the Havmanden-class design was largely obsolete by <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> Political considerations caused the order to be split between Austrian and Hungarian firms, which contributed to construction problems and delays, keeping any of the boats from being operational until the middle of 1917.|$|E
5|$|Achilles {{was ordered}} {{as part of}} the 1903–04 naval {{construction}} programme as the third of four armoured cruisers. She was laid down on 22 February 1904 at Elswick by Armstrong Whitworth. The ship was launched on 17 June 1905 and completed on 22 April 1907 at the cost of £1,191,103. Like her sister ships, she joined the 5th Cruiser Squadron in 1907, and made a port visit to Russia in 1908. The ship was later transferred to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron in 1909. Achilles, accompanied by her sister , and three other armoured cruisers were sent to reinforce the defences of the Shetland Islands on 2 August 1914, days {{before the start of the}} First World War. She, and her squadron, was assigned to the Grand Fleet after <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E
5|$|Angered {{with the}} {{passivity}} of Buenos Aires during the Luso-Brazilian {{invasion of the}} Banda Oriental, Francisco Ramírez from Entre Ríos and Estanislao López from Santa Fe joined forces against the city. Saavedra fled to Montevideo, fearing that Buenos Aires would be obliterated if defeated. Ramírez and López won the battle of Cepeda, but the city was not destroyed, so Saavedra returned. He retired in 1822, and lived {{with his family in}} the countryside. He offered his services at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>War</b> of Brazil, despite being 65 years old, but Balcarce declined the offer. He wrote his memoirs, Memoria autógrafa, in 1828.|$|E

5|$|Beagle was {{transferred}} to the 19th Destroyer Flotilla at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> and spent her time until April 1940 escorting convoys and patrolling in the English Channel and the North Sea aside from yet another dockyard period from 18 December 1939 to 22 January 1940. During the Norwegian Campaign, she escorted convoys between the Orkneys and Narvik, Norway. During the Battle of France, Beagle evacuated British troops and civilians from St. Nazaire and Bordeaux, France. During the former action, she rescued 600 survivors of the ocean liner , sunk by German aircraft during the evacuation, on 17 June.|$|E
5|$|Before the Croatian War of Independence Velebit {{served with}} the 88th Submarine Flotilla of the Yugoslav Navy {{entering}} service during the late 1980s. Velebit, then named Soča, was like other Una-class submarines, named after rivers in Yugoslavia. In 1991, it was being overhauled in Brodogradilište specijalnih objekata until <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> when Croatian forces captured it. In 1993, Brodarski Institut (BI) of Zagreb started a modification program to improve the operational capabilities of the submarine captured two years earlier. The hull was lengthend to create space needed for the installation of a single MTU 105kW diesel generator, a feature the original Una-class design lacked. A new steering system developed by BI was also installed.|$|E
5|$|Courbet and Paris {{formed a}} Fifth Squadron at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b> They were {{transferred}} to the Atlantic to continue their training duties without interference. Both ships were ordered restored to operational status on 21 May 1940 by Amiral Mord and their light anti-aircraft outfits were augmented at Cherbourg. Courbet was ordered to provide gunfire support to the defenders of Cherbourg against the advancing 7th Panzer Division and covered the evacuation of the town by the Allies while Paris supported the defenders of Le Havre. Lack of spotting aircraft meant that neither ship was particularly effective in that role.|$|E

5|$|During the 1860s and the American Civil War, the {{legislature}} {{was the scene}} of intense debate. At <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> the General Assembly was controlled by the southern sympathetic Democrats. Governor Oliver Morton and the Republican minority were able to prevent the General Assembly from meeting in 1862 and 1863 by denying the body quorum. Morton even had some members of the body arrested or detained on suspicions of disloyalty. The lack of funding created by this crisis again led to the near bankruptcy of the state. In 1864, the Republicans gained a majority and convened the General Assembly to remedy the state's funding problems.|$|E
5|$|Mahendra Pratap {{was head}} of the Indian princely states of Mursan and Hathras. He had been {{involved}} with the Indian National Congress in the 1900s, attending the Congress session of 1906. He toured the world in 1907 and 1911, and in 1912 contributed substantial funds to Gandhi's South African movement. Pratap left India for Geneva at <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> where he was met by Virendranath Chattopadhyaya of the Berlin Committee. Chattopadhyaya's efforts—along with a letter from the Kaiser—convinced Pratap to lend his support to the Indian nationalist cause, on the condition that the arrangements were made with the Kaiser himself. A private audience with the Kaiser was arranged, at which Pratap agreed to nominally head the expedition.|$|E

She saw action supporting Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, where she targeted shore batteries threatening the landings in November 1942. She remained in convoy patrol and training for several years, until she was moved to the Pacific Fleet late in the war and supported landings on Iwo Jima in February 1945, and later the invasion of Okinawa in April 1945. She was lightly damaged by a kamikaze attack in this battle. Following the war, she was used as a target ship during Operation Crossroads and subsequently studied for its effects, before being sunk as a target in 1948.|$|E
