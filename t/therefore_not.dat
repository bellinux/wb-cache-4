5|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{reliable}} geostationary satellite coverage in 1966, the number of eastern Pacific tropical cyclones was significantly underestimated.

5|$|Erosion acting upon {{different}} types of uplift-created joint and fracture systems is responsible for creating the valleys, canyons, domes, and other features we see today.

5|$|A {{conceptual}} design for another lake lander was proposed in late 2012 by the Spanish-based private engineering firm SENER and the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid. The concept probe is called Titan Lake In-situ Sampling Propelled Explorer (TALISE).

5|$|After Bamber telephoned the police, a British Telecom {{operator}} {{checked the}} White House Farm line—at 3:56am {{according to the}} police log and at 4:30 am according to the Court of Appeal—and found that the line was open. The operator could hear a dog barking. According to British Telecom, if Nevill had telephoned Bamber without replacing the receiver, the line between them would have remained open for between eight and 16 minutes. Bamber would <b>therefore</b> <b>not</b> have been able to use his telephone to report the call to the police immediately, as he said he did in one statement; in another statement he said he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London. That the line would not have cleared is one of several disputed points.|$|E

5|$|Believing {{that the}} wings were short and round, Gibbs thought {{the bird was}} not a strong flyer, and <b>therefore</b> <b>not</b> nomadic (periodically moving from place to place). In spite of the evidently longer wings which might have made it a strong flyer, vanGrouw also thought {{it would have been}} a {{sedentary}} (mostly staying at the same location) bird, that preferred not to fly across open water, similar to species in Ducula. It may have had a limited distribution on a small, remote island, which may explain why its provenance remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|Birds are now {{recognized}} {{as being the}} sole surviving lineage of theropod dinosaurs. In traditional taxonomy, birds were considered a separate class that had evolved from dinosaurs, a distinct superorder. However, a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject the traditional style of classification in favor of phylogenetic taxonomy; this approach requires that, for a group to be natural, all descendants {{of members of the}} group must be included in the group as well. Birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, <b>therefore,</b> <b>not</b> extinct. Birds are classified as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora, which are coelurosaurs, which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Chlordiazepoxide is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used benzodiazepine for alcohol detoxification, but diazepam may be used as an alternative. Both are used in the detoxification of individuals who are motivated to stop drinking, and are prescribed {{for a short period of}} time to reduce the risks of developing tolerance and dependence to the benzodiazepine medication itself. The benzodiazepines with a longer half-life make detoxification more tolerable, and dangerous (and potentially lethal) alcohol withdrawal effects are less likely to occur. On the other hand, short-acting benzodiazepines may lead to breakthrough seizures, and are, <b>therefore,</b> <b>not</b> recommended for detoxification in an outpatient setting. Oxazepam and lorazepam are often used in patients at risk of drug accumulation, in particular, the elderly and those with cirrhosis, because they are metabolized differently from other benzodiazepines, through conjugation.|$|E
