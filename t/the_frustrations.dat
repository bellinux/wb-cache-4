5|$|In 1919, <b>the</b> <b>frustrations</b> {{caused by}} delays to Irish home rule led the MPs of Sinn Féin, a pro-independence party that {{had won a}} {{majority}} of the Irish seats in the 1918 British general election, to establish an independent parliament in Dublin, at which Irish independence was declared. The Irish Republican Army simultaneously began a guerrilla war against the British administration. The Anglo-Irish War ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, creating the Irish Free State, a Dominion within the British Empire, with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the British Crown. Northern Ireland, consisting of six of the 32 Irish counties which had been established as a devolved region under the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, immediately exercised its option under the treaty to retain its existing status within the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Another team {{rose from}} the Pacific, as had Cobreloa. Colombian club América reached three {{consecutive}} finals in 1985, 1986 and 1987 but like Cobreloa they could not manage to win a single one. In 1985, Argentinos Juniors, a small club from the neighborhood of La Paternal in Buenos Aires, astonished South America by eliminating holders Independiente in La Doble Visera 2–1 during the last decisive match of the second round, to book {{a place in the}} final. Argentinos Juniors went on to win an unprecedented title by beating America de Cali in the play-off match via a penalty shootout. After <b>the</b> <b>frustrations</b> of 1966 and 1976, River Plate reached a third final in 1986 and were crowned champions {{for the first time ever}} after winning both legs of the final series against America de Cali, 2–1 at the Estadio Pascual Guerrero and 1–0 at Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti. Peñarol won the Cup again in 1987 after beating America de Cali 2–1 in the decisive playoff; it proved to be their last hurrah in the international scene as Uruguayan football, in general, suffered a great decline at the end of the 1980s. The Manyas fierce rivals, Nacional, also won one last cup in 1988 before falling from the continental limelight.|$|E
5|$|In September 1945, {{after he}} was {{released}} by the army, he returned to Piers Court with his family (another daughter, Harriet, had been born at Pixton in 1944) but {{spent much of the}} next seven years either in London, or travelling. In March 1946, he visited the Nuremberg trials, and later that year, he was in Spain for a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the death of Francisco de Vitoria, said to be the founder of international law. Waugh wrote up his experiences of <b>the</b> <b>frustrations</b> of postwar European travel in a novella, Scott-King's Modern Europe. In February 1947, he made the first of several trips to the United States, in the first instance to discuss filming of Brideshead. The project collapsed, but Waugh used his time in Hollywood to visit the Forest Lawn cemetery, which provided the basis for his satire of American perspectives on death, The Loved One. In 1951 he visited the Holy Land with his future biographer, Christopher Sykes, and in 1953, he travelled to Goa to witness the final exhibition before burial of the remains of the 16th century Jesuit missionary-priest Francis Xavier.|$|E
5000|$|Give each vertex a {{value of}} +1 or &minus;1; we call this a state of Σ. An edge is called {{satisfied}} if it is positive and both endpoints have the same value, or it is negative and the endpoints have opposite values. An edge that is not satisfied is called frustrated. The smallest number of frustrated edges over all states is called <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> index (or line index of balance) of Σ. Finding <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> index is hard, in fact, it is NP-hard. Aref, Mason, and Wilson suggest 0-1 programming models {{that are capable of}} finding <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> index of graphs with thousands of nodes and edges in a reasonable time [...] One can see the NP-hard complexity by observing that <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> index of an all-negative signed graph is equivalent to the maximum cut problem in graph theory, which is NP-hard. The reason for the equivalence is that <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> index equals <b>the</b> smallest number of edges whose negation (or, equivalently, deletion; a theorem of Harary) makes Σ balanced.

40|$|Computing <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> {{index of}} a signed graph {{is a key}} to solving {{problems}} in different fields of research including social networks, physics, material science, and biology. In social networks <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> index determines network distance from a state of structural balance. Although <b>the</b> definition of <b>frustration</b> index goes back to 1960, an exact algorithmic computation method has not yet been proposed. The main reason seems to be the complexity of computing <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> index which is closely related to well-known NP-hard problems such as MAXCUT. New quadratic and linear binary programming models are developed to compute <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> index exactly. We introduce several speed-up techniques involving prioritised branching, local search heuristics, and valid inequalities inferred from graph structural properties. The computational improvements achieved by implementing the speed-up techniques allow us to calculate the exact values of <b>the</b> <b>frustration</b> index by running the optimisation models in Gurobi solver. The speed-up techniques make our models capable of processing graphs with thousands of nodes and edges in seconds on inexpensive hardware. The solve time and solution quality comparison against the literature shows the superiority of our models in both random and real signed networks. Comment: 24 pages, 2 figures, 4 table...|$|R

Lennon regarded the song as [...] "a throwaway piece of garbage", and McCartney viewed it as Lennon's reaction to <b>the</b> <b>frustrations</b> of domestic life. Womack praises the song's varied time signatures, including 5/4, 3/4 and 4/4, calling it a [...] "masterpiece of electrical energy". MacDonald notes Starr's [...] "fine performance" [...] and McCartney's [...] "coruscating pseudo-Indian guitar solo", which he credits with delivering the track's climax. A series of animal noises are heard during the fade-out that are sequenced – at Lennon's request – so that each successive animal is large enough to devour the preceding one. Martin spliced the sound of a chicken clucking {{at the end of the}} track to overlap with a guitar being tuned in the next one, making a seamless transition between the two songs.|$|E

From his first Chesterfield Supper Club television show, if scripts were written at all, they were based on Como's everyday manner of speaking. Though Como was widely known for his amiability, laid-back and easygoing style, he was not devoid of a temper, and it could be seen at times as a result of <b>the</b> <b>frustrations</b> of daily life.
