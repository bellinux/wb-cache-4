40|$|Recent {{years we}} have {{witnessed}} a striking rise of the compound video, which is generated by computers. The High Efficiency Video Coding standard (HEVC) adopts the intra <b>transform</b> <b>skip</b> mode to improve the coding efficiency of compound video. In this paper, we improve the intra <b>transform</b> <b>skip</b> mode from two aspects. Firstly, we study the statistical character of the intra prediction residual and propose a separate coefficient scan order for the intra <b>transform</b> <b>skip</b> mode. Secondly, we analyze the probability of the intra <b>transform</b> <b>skip</b> mode for different coding unit (CU) sizes and prediction unit (PU) sizes, and then propose one limitation to reduce the applied range of intra <b>transform</b> <b>skip</b> mode.

As a result, HEVC has accomplished about 2 times of compression efficiency enhancement {{compared to the}} existing video coding standard of H. 264 /AVC.

40|$|Video coding {{standards}} are primarily designed for efficient lossy compression, {{but it is}} also desirable to support efficient lossless compression within video coding standards using small modifications to the lossy coding architecture. A simple approach is to <b>skip</b> <b>transform</b> and quantization, and simply entropy code the prediction residual. However, this approach is inefficient at compression. A more efficient and popular approach is to <b>skip</b> <b>transform</b> and quantization but also process the residual block with DPCM, along the horizontal or vertical direction, prior to entropy coding. This paper explores an alternative approach based on processing the residual block with integer-to-integer (i 2 i) transforms. I 2 i transforms can map integer pixels to integer transform coefficients without increasing the dynamic range and can be used for lossless compression. We focus on lossless intra coding and develop novel i 2 i approximations of the odd type- 3 DST (ODST- 3). Experimental results with the HEVC reference software show that the developed i 2 i approximations of the ODST- 3 improve lossless intra-frame compression efficiency with respect to HEVC version 2, which uses the popular DPCM method, by an average 2. 7 % without a significant effect on computational complexity.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we first}} {{introduce}} a spatio-temporal Just Noticeable Difference (JND) model based perceptual video coding (PVC) scheme which is completely compliant with HEVC. We incorporate into HEVC quantization process a JND model {{that takes into}} account both the temporal JND characteristics of temporal masking effects and the spatial JND characteristics of the luminance adaptation and contrast masking effects as well as contrast sensitivity. To be HEVC-compliant, the transform coefficients are suppressed based on the spatio-temporal JND model before quantization during HEVC encoding process. The spatio-temporal JND model works in transform domains in the cases of non-transform skip modes, but operates in pixel domains for the <b>transform</b> <b>skip</b> cases in HEVC. To make it effective the JND-based suppression, a distortion compensation factor is also proposed to reflect the perceptual distortion into the rate-distortion optimization (RDO) based encoding process. The proposed spatio-temporal JND-based PVC scheme in HEVC yields remarkable bitrate reductions of maximum 53. 37 % and average 10. 15 % with negligible PSNR/SSIM quality loss (average PSNR drop of 1. 46 dB and average SSIM drop 1. 46 %), compared to the original HEVC reference software (HM 11. 0).

40|$|Among various transforms, the {{discrete}} cosine transform (DCT) is {{the most}} widely used one in multimedia compression technologies for different image or video coding standards. During the development of image or video compression, a lot of interest has been attracted to understand the statistical distribution of DCT coefficients, which would be useful to design compression techniques, such as quantization, entropy coding and rate control. Recently, a bi-geometric transparent composite model (BGTCM) has been developed to provide modelling of distribution of DCT coefficients with both simplicity and accuracy. It has been reported that for DCT coefficients obtained from original images, which is applied in image coding, a transparent composite model (TCM) can provide better modelling than Laplacian. In video compression, such as H. 264 /AVC, DCT is performed on residual images obtained after prediction with different transform sizes. What's more, in high efficiency video coding(HEVC) which is the newest video coding standard, besides DCT as the main transform tool, discrete sine transform (DST) and <b>transform</b> <b>skip</b> (TS) techniques are possibly performed on residual data in small blocks. As such, the distribution of transformed residual data differs from that of transformed original image data. In this thesis, the distribution of coefficients, including those from all DCT, DST and TS blocks, is analysed based on BGTCM. To be specific, firstly, the distribution of all the coefficients from the whole frame is examined. Secondly, in HEVC, the entropy coding is implemented based on the new encoding concept, coefficient group (CG) with size 4 * 4, where quantized coefficients are encoded with context models based on their scan indices in each CG. To simulate the encoding process, coefficients at the same scan indices among different CGs are grouped together to form a set. Distribution of coefficients in each set is analysed. Based on our result, BGTCM is better than other widely used distributions, such as Laplacian and Cauchy distributions, in both x^ 2 and KL-divergence testing. Furthermore, unlike the way based on Laplacian and Cauchy distribution, the BGTCM can be used to model rate-quantization (R-Q) and distortion-quantization (D-Q) models without approximation expressions. R-Q and D-Q models based on BGTCM can reflect the distribution of coefficients, which are important in rate control. In video coding, rate control involves these two models to generate a suitable quantization parameter without multi-passes encoding {{in order to maintain the}} coding efficiency and to generate required rate to satisfy rate requirement. In this thesis, based on BGTCM, rate control in HEVC is revised with much increase in coding efficiency and decrease in rate fluctuation in terms of rate variance among frames for constant bit rate requirement. 1 yea...|$|E
40|$|My {{research}} {{focuses on}} developing programming systems (programming languages, compilers, and runtime systems) that deliver improved performance or resilience by changing the underlying semantics of the program. Although this approach violates the traditional contract that the programming system must preserve the program’s semantics, my research demonstrates that giving the programming system the freedom to change the semantics enables new methods for improved performance and resilience that are still sound and principled. Motivation and Overview Improving program performance and resilience are long-standing goals. Traditional approaches include a variety of transformation, compilation, and runtime techniques that share the common property that all executions of the resulting program are still legal executions of the original program. However, my research demonstrates that giving programming systems the freedom to change the semantics of the program can open up new and otherwise unavailable opportunities: { Performance.

40|$|In {{order to}} improve bitrates of {{lossless}} JPEG 2000, we propose to modify the discrete wavelet <b>transform</b> (DWT) by <b>skipping</b> selected steps of its computation. We employ a heuristic to construct the skipped steps DWT (SS-DWT) in an image-adaptive way and define fixed SS-DWT variants. For a large and diverse set of images, we find that SS-DWT significantly improves bitrates of non-photographic images. From a practical standpoint, the most interesting results are obtained by applying entropy estimation of coding effects for selecting among the fixed SS-DWT variants. This way we get the compression scheme that, {{as opposed to the}} general SS-DWT case, is compliant with the JPEG 2000 part 2 standard. It provides average bitrate improvement of roughly 5 % for the entire test-set, whereas the overall compression time becomes only 3 % greater than that of the unmodified JPEG 2000. Bitrates of photographic and non-photographic images are improved by roughly 0. 5 % and 14 %, respectively. At a significantly increased cost of exploiting a heuristic, selecting the steps to be skipped based on the actual bitrate instead of an estimated one, and by applying reversible denoising and lifting steps to SS-DWT, we have attained greater bitrate improvements of up to about 17. 5 % for non-photographic images.
