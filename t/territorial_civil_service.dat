This article enriches the comparative perspective of administrative reform policies by focusing on four interrelated dimensions: the choices of reformers, institutional constraints, timing and sequencing and long-term trajectories.

The Pendleton law required certain applicants to take the <b>civil</b> <b>service</b> exam in order to be given certain jobs; it also prevented elected officials and political appointees from firing civil servants, removing civil servants from the influences of political patronage and partisan behavior. President Arthur and succeeding Presidents continued to expand the authority of the <b>Civil</b> <b>Service</b> Commission and federal departments that the <b>Civil</b> <b>Service</b> was covered.
