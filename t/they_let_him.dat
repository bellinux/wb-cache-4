5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, {{and those who had}} not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E
5|$|After {{having a}} {{particularly}} bad day at school, Bart gets {{caught in a}} downpour and loses control of his skateboard. He crashes down the stairwell of the Legitimate Businessman's Social Club, a Mafia bar owned by the Springfield Mafia. Fat Tony, {{the leader of the}} Mafia, and his henchmen Legs and Louie are initially inhospitable towards Bart, but they are impressed by his ability to pick the winning horse in a horse race on the radio. When Bart makes up an excellent Manhattan cocktail for the mobsters, Fat Tony hires him as their bartender and errand boy. As Bart adopts more and more gangster-like traits, Marge grows anxious and tells Homer to go and meet the Mafia, but Homer approves of them after <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> win at poker.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Munch and Kellerman {{investigate}} a murder at Oriole Park at Camden Yards during a late-season baseball game, leaving 48,000 possible suspects. The Long Island man, presumably a Yankees fan, is found {{beaten to death}} on the stairs of the stadium, and the governor of Maryland pressures the police department to solve the murder before the game ends so that millions in tourism dollars and ticket revenues will not be jeopardized. After several fruitless interviews, Munch and Kellerman question Scott Russell (Brian Tarantina), a New Yorker who attended the game with the victim. Russell admits he killed the victim because he said the Baltimore Orioles were a better team than the Yankees. He agrees to confess to the murder if <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> watch {{the rest of the}} game. Back at the police department, Falsone continues questioning detectives about the Luther Mahoney shooting. Stivers expresses concern to Lewis that their covering for Kellerman's role in the shooting could bring both of them down if Falsone continues his questioning.|$|E

25|$|Guitarist Andy Taylor, on {{the other}} hand, led the {{remaining}} members to believe {{he would return to}} work on a new Duran Duran album even as he was signing a solo recording contract in Los Angeles (he eventually released a solo album in 1986, Thunder). The band resorted to legal measures to get him into the studio, but after numerous delays, <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> go at last. He played on only a few songs on the next album while the disagreements were being settled.|$|E
25|$|The Chu army led by Song Yi and Xiang Yu reached Anyang, some {{distance}} away from Julu (巨鹿; in present-day Xingtai, Hebei), where Zhao Xie's forces had retreated to. Song Yi ordered the troops to lay camp there for 46 days and he refused to accept Xiang Yu's suggestion to proceed further. Xiang Yu took Song Yi by surprise in a meeting and killed him {{on a charge of}} treason. Song Yi's other subordinates were afraid of Xiang Yu so <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> become the acting commander-in-chief. Xiang Yu sent a messenger to inform King Huai II and the king approved Xiang's command.|$|E
25|$|Reeve was a {{licensed}} pilot and flew solo across the Atlantic twice. During {{the filming of}} Superman III, he raced his sailplane in his free time. He joined The Tiger Club, a group of aviators who {{had served in the}} Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain. <b>They</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> participate in mock dogfights in vintage World War I combat planes. The producers of the film The Aviator approached him without knowing that he was a pilot and that he knew how to fly a Stearman, the plane used in the film. Reeve readily accepted the role. The film was shot in Kranjska Gora, and Reeve did all of his stunts. At this time, Gae Exton gave birth to their second child, Alexandra Exton Reeve, in December 1983 at Welbeck Hospital in London, England.|$|E

The original broadcast contained a small subplot involving Kevin and a new paper shredder from Staples Inc., where Kevin talks about how he is given almost no responsibility at work but is content as long as <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> shred documents. It was removed from the episode for the DVD release and is not contained in the deleted scenes.|$|E
500|$|The book {{received}} a favorable review in New Statesman, and William Leith wrote: [...] "This {{is an excellent}} study {{of what happens when}} a charismatic leader comes into contact with a group of rudderless, dispirited people. They follow him blindly. <b>They</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> get away with anything." [...] Montagu Curzon of The Spectator wrote that [...] "Guest makes an astonishingly mature debut (he is 27) and has the rare ability to describe childhood as a small child lives it; accepting, helpless, curious." [...] Lois Kendall gave the book a positive review in Cultic Studies Review, and wrote: [...] "The book is deep, yet light and readable, both for those who have had similar life experiences and who, I am sure, will find solace in this book, and for those with no such personal experience, who will find the narrative fascinating." [...] Publishers Weekly characterized My Life in Orange as [...] "Honest and vivid, this is an absorbing book about survival and good intentions gone awry." [...] Gillian Engberg of Booklist called the book a [...] "stirring memoir", and wrote: [...] "Guest writes with a reporter's sense of economy and restraint, letting absurd, even shocking details speak for themselves." [...] Christopher Hart gave the book a positive review in The Sunday Times, and wrote: [...] "Tim Guest’s extraordinary account of his childhood in the communes of Bhagwan, the notorious Indian guru, is a survivor’s tale, poignant, funny and wise." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 2012, Channel Orange {{was named}} the year's best album by {{numerous}} publications, including the Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago Tribune, Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, The Guardian, the Los Angeles Times, The Sydney Morning Herald, Now, Paste, PopMatters, Slant Magazine, Spin, and The Washington Post. It was named [...] "Album of the Year" [...] in HMV's Poll of Polls, an annual survey of British journalists from national print and online publications. It was also voted the best album of 2012 in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by The Village Voice. In an essay for the poll, the newspaper's Eric Sundermann deemed the victory unsurprising as Ocean [...] "dominated most music discussions this past year" [...] and had an equalizing effect on listeners of all music genres. Metacritic cited it as both the [...] "top-ranked" [...] and [...] "best-reviewed major album" [...] of 2012, as well as [...] "one of the best-reviewed albums of the past decade". Channel Orange won the Album of the Year award at the 2012 Soul Train Music Awards, and earned Ocean nominations for the 2013 Grammy Awards in the categories of Album of the Year, Best New Artist, and Record of the Year (for [...] "Thinkin Bout You"), winning for Best Urban Contemporary Album. Ocean agreed to perform at the awards show only if <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> play the song he wanted, [...] "Forrest Gump".

500|$|Both {{necklaces}} {{consist of}} a single row of large graduated [...] pearls with pearl clasps. The Queen Anne necklace {{is said to have}} belonged to Queen Anne, the last British monarch of the Stuart dynasty. Horace Walpole, the English art historian, wrote in his diary, [...] "Queen Anne had but few jewels and those indifferent, except one pearl necklace given to her by Prince George". Queen Caroline, on the other hand, {{had a great deal of}} valuable jewellery, including no fewer than four pearl necklaces. She wore all the pearl necklaces to her coronation in 1727, but afterwards had the 50 best pearls selected to make one large necklace. In 1947, both necklaces were given to Elizabeth by her father as a wedding present. On her wedding day, Elizabeth realised that she had left her pearls at St James's Palace. Her private secretary, Jock Colville, was asked to go and retrieve them. He commandeered the limousine of King Haakon VII of Norway, but traffic that morning had stopped, so even the king's car with its royal flag flying could not get anywhere. Colville completed his journey on foot, and when he arrived at St James's Palace, he had to explain the odd story to the guards who were protecting Elizabeth's 2,660 wedding presents. <b>They</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> in after finding his name on a guest list, and he was able to get the pearls to the princess in time for her portrait in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace.|$|E
500|$|In November 1927 Aiello {{organized}} machine-gun ambushes {{across from}} Lombardo's {{home and a}} cigar store frequented by Capone, but those plans were foiled after an anonymous tip led police to raid several addresses and arrest Milwaukee gunman Angelo La Mantio and four other Aiello gunmen. After the police discovered receipts for the apartments in La Mantio's pockets, he confessed that Aiello had hired him to kill Capone and Lombardo, leading the police to arrest Aiello himself and bring him to the South Clark Street police station. Upon learning of the arrest, Capone dispatched nearly two dozen gunmen to stand guard outside the station and await Aiello's release. The men {{made no attempt to}} publicly conceal their purpose there, and reporters and photographers rushed to the scene to observe Aiello's expected murder. Capone gunmen Frank Perry, Sam Marcus and Louis [...] "Little New York" [...] Campagna were arrested as they tried to enter the front of the station and placed in the cell next to Aiello, who Campagna told, [...] "You're dead, friend, dead. You won't get up {{to the end of the}} street still walking". Aiello pleaded for mercy and promised to sell his possessions and leave Chicago with his family if <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> go, but Campagna refused the request. When released, Aiello was given a police escort out of the station to safety. He later failed to make a court appearance after his attorney claimed he suffered a nervous breakdown. Aiello disappeared with some of family members to Trenton, NJ, where he continued his campaign against Capone and Lombardo.|$|E

'Why did <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> get on a bus if they are afraid of suicide bombers?… [...] He could have been running, but not from the police… [...] When the Underground stops, everybody runs to get on the train.

2500|$|In later years, Burr freely invented {{stories of}} a happy childhood.

He was already his full adult height and rather large and [...] "had fallen in with a group of college-aged kids who didn't realize how young Raymond was, and <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> tag along with them in activities and situations far too sophisticated for him to handle." [...] He developed a passion for growing things and, while still a teenager, joined the Civilian Conservation Corps for a year. Throughout his teenage years, he had some acting work, making his stage debut at age 12 with a Vancouver stock company.|$|E
2500|$|Goddard was {{appointed}} captain for the five-Test {{series against the}} visiting English side in 1964–65. However, after England won the First Test and the next two were drawn, the selectors asked him to relinquish the captaincy.

He refused to do so, and <b>they</b> <b>let</b> <b>him</b> remain captain {{for the rest of the}} series. When he scored his only Test century, 112, in the Fourth Test, [...] "almost the entire England team moved over to congratulate this most popular player. The crowd rose for fully a minute.
