5|$|At {{the same}} time {{each of the four}} {{divisions}} in the 2nd AIF was authorised a cavalry reconnaissance regiment equipped with light tanks and scout carriers. While all four divisions were authorised a divisional cavalry regiment, only three regiments were eventually formed as it was believed that the 8th Division did not need armoured support in Malaya due to concerns about operating tanks in the jungle. The cavalry regiments of the 2nd AIF divisions operating in Mediterranean theatre against Italian and German forces were initially equipped with the Universal Carrier and unarmoured trucks before being progressively mechanised using British Army equipment, while carriers were also operated by the infantry battalions. A light armoured <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> they were armed with Bren light machine guns and Boys anti-tank rifles and were widely used by British Commonwealth forces during the World War II. Meanwhile, the Australian Tank Corps was superseded following the formation of the Australian Armoured Corps in July 1941. In October 1941 two independent light tank squadrons had been formed for service in Malaya; however, neither was deployed {{due to a lack of}} vehicles to equip them.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tracked</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{have more}} {{traction}} off-road and more maneuverability, including a minute turn radius. Due {{to the limited}} service life of their treads, plus the wear they cause on roads, <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicles</b> are typically transported over long distances by rail, flatbed trucks or purpose built transporters.|$|R
50|$|Before {{the start}} of the company's {{development}} of <b>track</b> <b>vehicles,</b> Joseph-Armand Bombardier experimented with propeller-driven snow vehicles (similar to Russian aerosanis). His work with snowplane designs can be traced to before 1920. He quickly abandoned his efforts to develop a snowplane and turned his inventive skills to <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R
25|$|Differential braking {{actually}} predates clutch braking on tracked vehicles, {{having been}} initially introduced by Richard Hornsby & Sons in 1905 on the world's first <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Clutch braking became popular {{only because of}} its mechanical simplicity. Differential braking could be found on many smaller tanks, especially in the pre-World War II era. British tanks began using them during World War I, and continued into World War II. One common example was the Bren Carrier.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} {{was given to}} Tokyo Gas and Electric Industry (later known as Hino Motors) in 1933, and an experimental model was completed in 1934. It was a small light <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> with a turret armed with one machine gun. For cargo transportation it pulled an ammunition trailer. It was reclassified as the Type 94 (Type 2594; tankette) and was designed for reconnaissance, but {{could also be used}} for supporting infantry attacks and transporting supplies. After trials in both Manchukuo and Japan, the design was standardized as the Type 94 tankette. It entered service in 1935. The Type 94 was later superseded by the Type 97 tankette, which was designed as a fast reconnaissance vehicle.|$|E
500|$|In Europe, Major Ernest Swinton, sent to France as an army war correspondent, {{very soon}} saw the {{potential}} of a track-laying tractor. [...] He proposed to Sir Maurice Hankey, Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, that the British build a power-driven, bullet-proof, <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> that could destroy enemy machine-guns.

500|$|In England, {{starting}} in 1905, [...] David Roberts of Richard Hornsby & Sons {{had attempted to}} interest British military officials in a <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle,</b> but failed. Holt bought the patents related to the [...] "chain track" [...] track-type tractor from Richard Hornsby & Sons in 1912 for £4,000 (almost £400,000 at 2012 value). Unlike the Holt tractor, which had a steerable tiller wheel {{in front of the}} tracks, the Hornsby crawler was steered by controlling power to each track.|$|E
500|$|To build a {{permanent}} airfield at Troll, the Norwegian Polar Institute bought a snow groomer and a <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> with a snow blower, flatbed and ice cutter.

This included removing of surface rocks and filling any crevasses.

500|$|Preliminary {{design of}} all the German half-tracks of {{the early part of}} the war was done by Dipl.Ing. Ernst Kniepkamp of the Military Automotive Department (Wa Prüf 6) before the Nazis took power in 1933. His designs were then turned over to {{commercial}} firms for development and testing. Fahrzeug- und Motorenbau GmbH (FAMO) of Breslau received the contract for the [...] heavy towing <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Their first prototype, the FM gr 1, was completed in 1936.

This article investigates the feasibility of <b>tracking</b> <b>vehicles</b> with regular GPS devices. Since downtown is generally the “heart ” of a city with high density of vehicles and activities, locating vehicles precisely there is extremely important.

2500|$|The Bionix was {{the first}} local {{armoured}} fighting vehicle, designed and developed by ST Kinetics. It is a medium-weight <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle,</b> weighing between twenty-two to twenty-eight tonnes, to replace the aging M-113A2 armoured personnel carriers. The Bionix was commissioned by the SAF in September 1997 and operated under the 42nd Battalion of the Singapore Armoured Regiment (42 SAR). During the commissioning parade in July 1999, then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, Dr Tony Tan, declared the Bionix IFV to be [...] "a highly effective indigenous armoured vehicle". The Bionix was eventually succeeded by the Bionix II, which was jointly developed by the SAF, the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA), and ST Kinetics.|$|E
2500|$|The pre-series {{vehicles}} get {{the company}} designation Modèle 1928 or M 28 after {{the year they}} were delivered; the production vehicles are likewise named Modèle 1929 or M 29, though the actual delivery was in 1930 and 1931. The official name however, assigned in 1931, is the AMC Schneider P 16. The P 16 was thus accepted as conforming to the specifications for a wheeled AMC, or an AMC N°1, as stated [...] by the Supreme Command on 12 April 1923, although the vehicle was not specifically designed to meet them, and partially fulfilling the requirements of an AMC N°2 stated in August 1924, which asked for a <b>tracked</b> <b>vehicle</b> — as a half-track it was indeed in between. [...] "AMC" [...] stands for Automitrailleuse de Combat. Although automitrailleuse is today a synonym for [...] "armoured car", in those days it was the codename for any Cavalry armoured vehicle as the Cavalry was in 1922 forbidden by law to employ tanks. In fact their rôle was pretty much that of a main battle tank as the Cavalry would not acquire real modern guntanks until 1935; in the twenties fully tracked vehicles were, {{given the state of}} technological development, considered by the Cavalry as being either to slow or not reliable enough. [...] "P 16" [...] refers to the Panhard 16 engine. Confusingly, the pre-series vehicles only were fitted with it, while the production vehicles have the Panhard 17. In total 96 vehicles of the main series were produced, serial numbers from the range 37002 - 37168, resulting in a total of 100 vehicles.|$|E
