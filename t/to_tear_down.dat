5|$|Despite Reagan urging Gorbachev <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> the Berlin Wall, {{there are}} some such as Romesh Ratnesar of Time who commented {{that there is little}} {{evidence}} that the speech had any impact on the decision <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> the wall, let alone an impact on the people he addressed. Another critic was Liam Hoare in a 2012 article in The Atlantic, who pointed to the many reasons for the tendency for American media to focus on the significance of this particular speech, without weighing the complexity of the events as they unfolded in both East and West Germany and the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|The Roseland Ballroom {{opened in}} its first Manhattan {{location}} at 51st Street in 1919, after moving from Philadelphia. It moved to its current location at 52nd Street in 1956, as a converted skating rink. The venue began as a hall for ballroom dancing and orchestra groups, but later shifted its focus through various eras of popular music, including disco, grunge, and EDM. While the Roseland Ballroom has seen performances from a both up-and-coming bands and established acts, rumors have been circulating since 1996 about the venue's demise, after Ginsberg filed plans <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> its low-rise, three-story structure {{and replace it with}} a 59-story high-rise. It was announced on October 19, 2013 that the Roseland Ballroom would be closing in April 2014, after over 50 years of operation at its current location.|$|E

5000|$|The {{slipcover}} was {{a popular}} treatment in the United States after World War II as early twentieth-century building styles {{had fallen out of}} fashion. Constructing a slipcover with a contemporary design over an existing building was a less expensive alternative <b>to</b> <b>tearing</b> <b>down</b> and building anew. Sometimes attachments of the slipcover caused damage to the original facings. At other times, slipcovers have protected the original facings from deterioration.|$|R

5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E
5|$|The early European {{settlers}} killed emus {{to provide}} food and used their fat for fuelling lamps. They {{also tried to}} prevent them from interfering with farming or invading settlements in search of water during drought. An extreme example of this was the Emu War in Western Australia in 1932. Emus flocked to the Chandler and Walgoolan area during a dry spell, damaging rabbit fencing and devastating crops. An attempt to drive them off was mounted, with the army called in to dispatch them with machine guns; the emus largely avoided the hunters and won the battle. Emus are large, powerful birds, and their legs are among the strongest of any animal and powerful enough <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> metal fencing. The birds are very defensive of their young, and there have been two documented cases of humans being attacked by emus.|$|E

50|$|During {{the early}} 1960s, the city {{initiated}} plans to demolish and redevelop {{sixty percent of}} the housing in Charlestown. In 1963, the Boston Redevelopment Authority (BRA) held a town meeting to discuss their development plans with the community. The BRA's dealings with Boston's West End had created an atmosphere of distrust towards urban renewal in Boston, and Charlestown residents opposed the plan by an overwhelming majority. By 1965, the plan had been reduced <b>to</b> <b>tearing</b> <b>down</b> only eleven percent of the neighborhood, as well as the removal of the elevated rail tracks.|$|R

25|$|In 1978, a deconstructive {{version of}} The Taming of the Shrew was {{performed}} at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre.

25|$|In the 1950s San Francisco mayor George Christopher hired M. Justin Herman to {{head the}} {{redevelopment}} agency {{for the city and}} county. Justin Herman began an aggressive campaign <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> blighted areas of the city that were really working class, non-white neighborhoods. Enacting eminent domain whenever necessary, he set upon a plan <b>to</b> <b>tear</b> <b>down</b> huge areas of the city and replace them with modern construction. Critics accused Herman of racism for what was perceived as attempts to create segregation and displacement of blacks. Many black residents were forced to move from their homes near the Fillmore jazz district to newly constructed projects such as near the naval base at Hunter's Point or even to other cities such as Oakland. He began leveling entire areas in San Francisco's Western Addition and Japantown neighborhoods. Herman also completed the final removal of the produce district below Telegraph Hill, moving the produce merchants to the Alemany Boulevard site. His planning {{led to the creation of}} Embarcadero Center, the Embarcadero Freeway, Japantown, the Geary Street superblocks, and eventually Yerba Buena Gardens.|$|E
