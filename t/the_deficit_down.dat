The Dolphins later scored on an 80-yard drive, with quarterback Dan Marino completing passes to Bruce Hardy for 12 yards and Mark Duper for 18 before finding tight end Dan Johnson {{in the end zone}} with an 11-yard touchdown pass. But New England responded on a 66-yard possession, featuring a 45-yard run from Robert Weathers, to score on quarterback Tony Eason's 4-yard touchdown to Tony Collins, giving the Pats a 10–7 lead. On Miami's next drive, Marino fumbled the ball and nose tackle Lester Williams recovered for New England on the Dolphins 36-yard line.

Pat Roche wrote in the Irish Times:Weathering a storm of Galway onslaughts in the closing 10 minutes had been an achievement in itself. Avenging last year's defeat by Galway was sheer joy for the team - and for the supporters it was a delight to watch the skills of goalkeeper Cora Keohane, defenders Denise Cronin and Sandie Fitzgibbon, garnished by the delicate scoring touches of Lynn Dunlea, The timing of her scores {{in the second half}} was as crucial as the points themselves, as they staved off a threatened Galway storm. The best example of this came in the seventh minute of the second half after Denise Gilligan smashed home Galway's first goal, leaving only three points between the sides. Dunlea added a second to take the good out of that Galway goal and was on the mark again inside the last five minutes when the defiant Galway women got <b>the</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>down</b> to four points with a goal from substitute Veronica Curtin.Galway manager Tony Ward said:We threw it away in the first half.

Sammie Szmodics and David Fox were both rested for the encounter, and the changes looked to have paid off after just three minutes when Tom Lapslie headed in Elliott Hewitt's spilt cross to score his first senior goal for the club. Eleven minutes later, Macauley Bonne's selection paid dividends when he nodded home his first of the season from a Matthew Briggs cross from the left.

40|$|Is the U. S. {{trade deficit}} made in China? The {{short answer is}} no. In recent years U. S. {{bilateral}} trade deficits have been increasing not only with China but most other trading partners as well. The imbalance on bilateral trade with China, though large, still accounts for less than one-quarter of the total. However, official purchases of U. S. dollar assets by China and other U. S. trading partners have facilitated the continued high level of U. S. domestic spending, and some analysts believe that large foreign purchases of U. S. assets {{have been responsible for}} keeping U. S. long-term interest rates low. Like China-specific trade policies at the level of individual products, a stronger yuan may benefit other U. S. trading partners, especially ones that have recently lost market share due to depreciation of the U. S. dollar against their own currencies. But yuan appreciation also means lower Chinese official purchases of U. S. dollars, which would likely put upward pressure on U. S. interest rates and thus moderate domestic spending. So yuan appreciation could reduce the U. S. overall trade imbalance, although {{it is not necessary to}} address the fundamental cause of <b>the</b> <b>deficit,</b> which lies in current macroeconomic conditions at home. The United States government will have an urgent case of adopting prudent and traditional ways to obtain credit for consumption, else the threat of trade deficit will eventually go out of a hand and military blackmail and economic blackmail by China, deindustrialization and massive loss of jobs for American workers might be the end result. But I do not foresee <b>the</b> trade <b>deficit</b> coming <b>down</b> just yet and it will maintain at current level for many years to come. China economic ambition, Chinese workers, American household and to a certain extent, American economy might just be cheering at the sidelines as beneficiaries...|$|R
