5|$|Recent animal {{research}} coupling a murine {{monoclonal antibody}} with doxorubicin {{has created an}} immunoconjugate that was able to eliminate HIV-1 infection in mice.

5|$|There are two {{approaches}} to treating Chagas disease: antiparasitic <b>treatment,</b> <b>to</b> kill the parasite; and symptomatic <b>treatment,</b> <b>to</b> manage the symptoms {{and signs of}} the infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the parasympathetic nervous system. Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and spares the sympathetic autonomic nervous system remain poorly understood.|$|E

In November 1993, they began developing three new television pilots from their offices at Warner Bros. Television that could premiere in the Fall 1994 season.

McCarthy claimed that the accusation was made in bad faith, in retaliation for his questioning of Zwicker the previous year. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, usually chaired by McCarthy himself, was given the task of adjudicating these conflicting charges. Republican Senator Karl Mundt was appointed to chair the committee, and the Army–McCarthy hearings convened on April 22, 1954.|$|E
