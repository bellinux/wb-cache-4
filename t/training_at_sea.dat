25|$|The first Soviets {{to arrive}} at Cold Bay {{were members of the}} Soviet Purchasing Commission, who disembarked at the base on 23 March 1945. Maxwell {{believed}} that a great deal of classroom training would be necessary before the Soviet personnel began to train at sea, but the Soviet officers disagreed, preferring a greater emphasis on <b>training</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> They worked for a week on a training program that both sides could agree on, and achieved a successful compromise before the first trainees arrived.|$|E

2500|$|On-the-job <b>training</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> is {{critical}} to a helmsman developing ability to [...] "sense" [...] or anticipate how a ship will respond in different conditions. [...] The experienced helmsman uses measured responses to sea conditions, even when encountering heavy weather that may cause a ship to pitch and roll as it pounds its way through oncoming waves. Subsequently, the helmsman learns to relax and {{take into account the}} vessel's natural rhythm in order to avoid oversteering whatever the maritime environment. Consequently, more accurate steering is attained with less rudder. Applying the minimal rudder required to steer a course reduces drag of the ship, thereby favorably impacting the ship's speed and operating costs.|$|E

The British Admiralty provided instructional officers for training in seamanship, company and field drill, torpedo and electrical instruction, engineer and stokehold work, signaling, wireless telegraphy and first aid. Those volunteers who were seamen or fisherman in their civilian careers were to receive <b>training</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> while those who lived near to the sea would do some of their <b>training</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> and those who lived inland would receive their training at their company's headquarters.|$|E

Blueback traveled south to the Vietnam war zone to render training services to destroyer units of the 7th Fleet {{and then returned to}} Japan for upkeep at Yokosuka. On 11 October, the submarine got underway for more <b>training</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> She paused once again at Yokosuka before sailing for Hawaii on 29 November.

5000|$|On 24 March 1970, Bauer got {{underway}} for {{a two-week}} training cruise, including a port visit to Mazatlan, Mexico, {{before returning to}} her usual schedule of weekend drills and underway exercises. For the next three years, Bauer continued this pattern of reserve training operations. Highlights included training cruises to San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Vancouver, and even one voyage to Hawaii in June and July 1972. Target ship services were provided to such fleet units as the submarine , and the reserve crew provided planeguard services for the carriers [...] and [...] in January 1973. During this time period, she also served as the training ship for the Parche Division of the United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps (USNSCC), whose members <b>trained</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> alongside the reserve contingent. On 13 July, however, the destroyer escort failed her service inspections. Material deficiencies such as inadequate communications systems, worn out machinery, and poor habitability, combined {{with a lack of}} environmental and crew safety gear, led to a recommendation for disposal.|$|R

25|$|That November, Fisher sat his lieutenant's {{examination}} and passed with flying colours.

50|$|The {{circumstance}} of Spencer, Cromwell and Small's deaths is {{one reason}} the U.S. Navy stopped <b>training</b> boys <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> and founded the United States Naval Academy.

2500|$|Some of the {{individual}} athletes came up with ideas to further their <b>training</b> while <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> Discus champion James Duncan had the ship's carpenter bore {{a hole in the}} middle of a discus, through which he attached a rope tied to the ship's rail. Duncan would then throw the discus out to sea, and then haul it back in by the rope. Theodore Roosevelt Pell, the only U.S. competitor in any of the tennis events, set up a [...] backstop on the after deck, practicing for hours each day.|$|R
5000|$|Besides {{type and}} {{underway}} <b>training</b> exercises <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> Vulcan made an occasional NROTC midshipman cruise and conducted individual ship exercises in between her regular long assignments as repair ship at Norfolk.
