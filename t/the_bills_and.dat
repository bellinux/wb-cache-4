5|$|His {{mother was}} {{supportive}} of his comic endeavours and would often drive him to stand-up gigs at the comedy club Yuk Yuks. With his deadpan humour, {{he won the}} Vancouver Amateur Comedy Contest at 16 years old. Also when Rogen was 16, his father lost his job and his mother quit hers, forcing them to put their house up for sale and relocate to a significantly smaller apartment. Around this time, he landed a role on Judd Apatow's television show Freaks and Geeks after attending a local casting call. Despite a strong academic performance, Rogen {{dropped out of high}} school, began working for Apatow, and relocated with his family to Los Angeles. Rogen paid <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> <b>and</b> had become the main wage earner at just16.|$|E

5|$|The plumage of most seabirds is less {{colourful}} {{than that}} of land birds, restricted in the main to variations of black, white or grey. A few species sport colourful plumes (such as the tropicbirds and some penguins), {{but most of the}} colour in seabirds appears in <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> <b>and</b> legs. The plumage of seabirds is thought in many cases to be for camouflage, both defensive (the colour of US Navy battleships is {{the same as that of}} Antarctic prions, and in both cases it reduces visibility at sea) and aggressive (the white underside possessed by many seabirds helps hide them from prey below).|$|E
5|$|Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, the yellow-faced honeyeater {{is thought}} to have adapted to a mixed diet. Its diet {{consists}} of nectar, pollen, fruit, seeds, honeydew, and insects. It is arboreal, foraging primarily among the foliage and flowers of trees, shrubs, and mistletoes, less often on branches and tree trunk, and rarely on the ground. Yellow-faced honeyeaters feed on nectar around 40% of the time, and on insects around 60% of the time. The yellow-faced honeyeater feeds on insects by gleaning, and by sallying or catching insects in flight or probing in bark crevices. The insects eaten are primarily Diptera (flies, mosquitoes, maggots, gnats, and midges), beetles and spiders. A study of the pollen on <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> <b>and</b> foreheads of captured birds found that 70% carried pollen from silver banksia (Banksia marginata), 61% from heath-leaved banksia (Banksia ericifolia), and 22% carried pollen from other plants in the area including fern-leaved banksia (Banksia oblongifolia), mountain devil (Lambertia formosa) and green spider flower (Grevillea mucronulata).|$|E
5|$|The Patriots and the Bills {{were both}} charter {{members of the}} AFL, and even competed {{with each other in}} an AFL playoff game. They have {{remained}} divisional rivals since the NFL-AFL merger. Prior to the rise of Tom Brady, the two teams shared a mellow, yet occasionally competitive rivalry, featuring highlights from players such as O.J. Simpson, Steve Grogan, Joe Ferguson, Jim Kelly, and Drew Bledsoe. However, Brady has dominated the Bills ever since taking over as the Patriots' franchise quarterback, holding a 26-3 regular season record over them. Though Patriots fans usually feel apathetic towards the Bills, Bills fans have come to despise the Patriots more than any other rival. The rivalry has remained somewhat intense in recent years with multiple players having played for both teams, the Bills usually giving their all when playing the Patriots, and the presence of Rex Ryan, who coached both <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>and</b> Jets and was known for his trash-talk.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>and</b> Chiefs {{were also}} {{original}} {{teams in the}} AFL and have {{had a long history}} against each other, despite never being in the same division. This rivalry heated up recently as <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>and</b> Chiefs met in consecutive years from 2008 to 2015, and will meet again in 2017. The teams have played three playoff games, including the AFL Championship game that determined the AFL's (later AFC) representative in the first Super Bowl, with Kansas City winning and going on to face the Green Bay Packers in the Super Bowl. Buffalo currently leads the series 25-21-1.|$|E

25|$|Though the {{two teams}} are in {{different}} divisions and did not start playing each other until after 1972, match-ups between <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>and</b> the Cleveland Browns occasionally get heated up due to the proximity and similarity between the cities of Buffalo and Cleveland. Like the Bills-Jets rivalry, <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>and</b> Browns often share bad luck and have had their share of ugly games. However, {{there have been other}} occasions when both teams have been competitive such as in the 1980s and most recently in 2007 and 2014. The rivalry also gained heat when former Bills safety Donte Whitner was with the Browns. The Browns currently lead the series 12-9, including a playoff win in 1990, though the Bills have outscored the Browns in the series.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>and</b> Jets both {{represent}} {{the state of}} New York, though the Jets actually play their games in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The rivalry started as <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> <b>and</b> Jets were both original teams in the AFL. Though the rivalry represents the differences between New York City and Upstate New York, {{it is not as}} intense as the Bills' rivalries with the Dolphins and Patriots, and the teams' fanbases usually have a begrudging respect for each other when not playing one another. Often times the rivalry has become beset with ugly games and mediocrity, but the rivalry briefly heated up when former Jets head coach Rex Ryan became head coach of the Bills for two seasons. Buffalo leads the series 60-53 as of 2016, including a playoff win in 1981.|$|E

Many Hawaiian businesses and citizens were feeling the pressures of the loss of revenue, so Liliuokalani proposed a lottery and opium licensing to bring in additional revenue for the government.
