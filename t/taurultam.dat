5000|$|Metabolism: Taurolidine and <b>taurultam</b> {{are quickly}} metabolized to taurinamide, taurine, carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (Fig 1). Taurolidine exists in {{equilibrium}} with <b>taurultam</b> and N-methylol- <b>taurultam</b> in aqueous solution.|$|E
5000|$|Pharmacokinetic (elimination): The {{half-life}} of {{the terminal}} elimination phase of <b>taurultam</b> is about 1.5 hours, and of the taurinamide metabolite about 6 hours. 25% of the taurolidine dose applied is renally eliminated as taurinamide and/or taurine.|$|E
50|$|Following {{administration}} of taurolidine, the antimicrobial and antiendotoxin {{activity of the}} taurolidine molecule is conferred by the release of three active methylol (hydroxymethyl) groups as taurolidine is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis via methylol <b>taurultam</b> to methylol taurinamide and taurine. These labile N-methylol derivatives of <b>taurultam</b> and taurinamide react with the bacterial cell-wall resulting in lysis of the bacteria, and by inter- and intramolecular cross-linking of the lipopolysaccharide-protein complex, neutralization of the bacterial endotoxins which is enhanced by enzymatic activation. This mechanism of action is accelerated and maximised when taurolidine is pre-warmed to 37 °C. Microbes are killed and the resulting toxins are inactivated; the destruction time in vitro is 30 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|No {{systemic}} {{side effects}} have been identified. The safety of taurolidine {{has also been}} confirmed in clinical studies with long-term intravenous administration of high doses (up to 20 g daily). In the body, taurolidine is metabolized rapidly via the metabolites <b>taurultam</b> and methylol taurinamide, which also have a bactericidal action, to taurine, an endogenous aminosulphonic acid, CO2 and H2O. Therefore, no toxic effects are known or expected {{in the event of}} accidental injection. Burning sensation while instilling, numbness, erythema, facial flushing, headache, epistaxis, nausea ...|$|E
40|$|Taurolidine is an {{experimental}} antibacterial and antiendotoxic compound whose clinical utility as an antitumor agent {{is being investigated}} in human clinical trials. Taurolidine in aqueous solution exists in equilibrium with <b>taurultam.</b> <b>Taurultam</b> is subsequently transformed to taurinamide. The pharmacokinetic profiles of these metabolites are not well established. In this study, 18 healthy volunteers were administered 5. 0 g of taurolidine in 250 mL of 5 % polyvinylpyrrolidone in water over 2, 1, or 0. 5 hours by intravenous infusion in a parallel-group design. All subjects noted discomfort at the infusion site, although there were no serious adverse events. t(max) generally occurred {{at the end of}} infusion for taurinamide, whereas that of <b>taurultam</b> was reached before completion of infusion. The taurolidine metabolite <b>taurultam</b> demonstrated a shorter half-life and lower systemic exposure than taurinamide. Shortening of infusion duration increased the C(max) and AUC of <b>taurultam.</b> Changes in infusion rate did not substantially change the pharmacokinetic parameters of taurinamide...|$|E
40|$|The taurine amino-acid derivative, taurolidine, bis-(1, 1 -dioxoperhydro- 1, 2, 4 -thiabiazinyl– 4) methane, shows broad {{antibacterial}} {{action against}} gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria and some clinically relevant fungi. It inhibits, in vitro, the adherence of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus to human epithelial and fibroblast cells. Taurolidine is unstable {{in aqueous solution}} and breaks down into derivatives which {{are thought to be}} responsible for the biological activity. To understand the taurolidine antibacterial mechanism of action, we provide the experimental single crystal X-ray diffraction results together with theoretical methods to characterize the hydrolysis/decomposition reactions of taurolidine. The crystal structure features two independent molecules linked through intermolecular H-bonds with one of them somewhat positively charged. Taurolidine in a biological environment exists in equilibrium with <b>taurultam</b> derivatives and this is described theoretically as a 2 -step process without an energy barrier: formation of cationic taurolidine followed by a nucleophilic attack of O(hydroxyl) on the exocyclic C(methylene). A concerted mechanism describes the further hydrolysis of the taurolidine derivative methylol-taurultam. The interaction of methylol-taurultam with the diaminopimelic NH 2 group in the E. coli bacteria cell wall (peptidoglycan) has a negative DG value (238. 2 kcal/mol) but a high energy barrier (45. 8 kcal/ mol) suggesting no reactivity. On the contrary, taurolidine docking into E. coli fimbriae protein, responsible for bacteri...|$|E
40|$|Taurolidine (TRD) is {{an agent}} with {{antiseptic}} and antineoplastic effects clinically first administered in 1975. It is a soluble {{product of the}} amino acid Taurin and is hydrolytically separated to its active metabolites <b>Taurultam</b> and Methyltaurultam. Its contact with bacteria leads to loss of their pathogenesis. TRD inhibits the release of TNFα and IL- 1 β as well as angiogenesis, which is of great importance for solid tumor growth. The mechanisms of TRD antineoplastic effects were investigated. TRD has an antineoplastic effect on more than 30 cell lineages in vitro. We have thoroughly examined its molecular mechanisms of action. Experiments showed a reduction of the intracellular protein level of transcription factors and cell cycle regulators. Effects on the COP 9 signalosome, a multimeric regulatory protein complex involved in signal transduction and ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis could be excluded. The Transcription process was not blocked by the highest TRD concentrations. The translation was intensively assessed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. It was shown that TRD acts as an inhibitor of an early phase in translation. It blocks protein biosynthesis in mammalian cells {{as well as in}} bacteria, which mig ht explain most of its pleiotropia effects, including induction of apoptosis. Antineoplastic effects of TRD were confirmed in several experimental studies on animal models. A single intraperitoneal (IP) dose caused a reduction of intra- and extraperitoneal metastases in rats. Direct contact with tumor cells had a much higher antineoplastic effect than the single intravenous (IV) application after laparoscopy or laparotomy. Further experiments showed that longer IV administration with higher doses could inhibit IP tumor growth and subcutaneous metastatic disease without relevant toxic effects in rats. The IP and IV administration of TRD reduced total tumor weight and number of metastatic lesions of disseminated malignant melanoma in a dose dependent way in mice. Our encouraging findings will be further examined in clinical studies. The effect of intraoperative IP instillation of TRD versus PVD-iodine in colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancer was examined in a multicenter prospective randomized clinical trial. Lavage with TRD delayed the increase of IL- 1 β compared to the control group without relevant adverse effects. As a result the IP administration TRD could be of benefit as a treatment for the prevention of metastasis in surgical oncology. Therefore, a new prospective randomized multicenter trial was set up in November 2005. Aim {{of this study was to}} examine the influence of intraoperative instillation and abdominal lavage with 2 % TRD versus irrigation with 0. 9 % NaCl (control group) on metastases and local tumor recurrence (n= 2000). A significant advantage of TRD is the absence of adverse effects on haemopoiesis. TRD 2 % is being currently applied intravenously as part of a Phase III clinical study, in order to assess safety and toxicity of the agent in patients with advanced or recurrent gastric and pancreatic cancer. The bodyweight correlated TRD doses of 300 mg/kg KG/Day had nor clinical neither biochemical adverse effects. In some patients with recurrence of gastric cancer we observed a slow progression of the disease with a good quality of life. In one patient no evidence of his previous gastric cancer re-recurrence was detected. Summarizing, the combination of antineoplastic effects of TRD with a low toxicity render the substance a promising therapeutic option for several malignancies, where traditional therapeutic modalities fail. TRD could be administered either as monotherapy or as part of a protocol with other chemotherapeutics in the future...|$|E
