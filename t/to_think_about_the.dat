5|$|Attitudes toward race in America {{began to}} change after the war, which had caused social and {{political}} upheaval and prompted people <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future with more ambition and confidence. Although progress was slow and racially motivated hostility continued for many years, the color barrier was broken in all major sports by 1950. Many of Motley and Willis's teammates on the Browns were used to playing with black players in college, where teams were integrated across most of the country. The presence of Motley and Willis, meanwhile, contributed to strong attendance at many of the Browns' early games as large black audiences came to watch them. By one estimate, 10,000 black fans saw the Browns play their first game.|$|E

25|$|In 1928, Allis-Chalmers {{acquired}} the Monarch Tractor Company of Springfield, Illinois, thus adding {{a line of}} crawler tractors. In 1929, it {{acquired the}} La Crosse Plow Works of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The La Crosse Plow Works had a good-quality plow and various desirable implements, which now expanded the Allis-Chalmers implement line. Also in 1929, Harry Merritt was in California when the bright orange California poppy blossoms inspired him <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> use of bright colors in marketing. Brightly colored {{things that can be}} seen from far away had potential in farm equipment marketing. He soon changed the paint color of Allis-Chalmers's tractors to Persian Orange, the available paint color that he felt most closely resembled the California poppy's color. Thus began the tradition of orange Allis-Chalmers tractors. Various competitors would follow suit over the next decade, as International Harvester switched to all-red (1936), Minneapolis-Moline switched to Prairie Gold (late 1930s), and Case switched to Flambeau Red (late 1930s). John Deere already had a distinctive color scheme with its bright green and yellow.|$|E

500|$|As {{the number}} of First World War {{veterans}} dwindled, calls grew to give the last remaining veteran a state funeral. The calls resulted in Her Majesty's Government approving on 27 June 2006 a National Memorial Service at Westminster Abbey to take place {{after the death of}} the last known British First World War veteran. Before this announcement Allingham often said that he tried not <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> prospect, but has also been quoted as saying [...] "I don't mind— as long as it's not me." [...] Allingham received a letter from Member of Parliament Tom Watson on 14 July 2006 explaining the reasoning for a national memorial service rather than a state funeral, as the intention is to commemorate the entire generation that fought in the war rather than single out an individual.|$|E
500|$|As Thakkar {{explained}} in a 2016 interview to The Times of India, the DreamWorks Animation Media Review System was developed {{in an era of}} 56K modems: [...] "They wanted any artist to view any number of shots, back-to-back, from part of the film, in high resolution, at 24 fps, with high quality audio, with speed-change control, from any phase of production from any department (story, editing, animation, modeling, layout, lighting, vfx, etc.)..." [...] As per Thakkar, it was a technology that allowed technicians and artists in multiple locations to simultaneously work on films in real time; one of the main provisions was useful transparency, enabling artists and technicians to seamlessly do their work without any need <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> technology. Apart from the DreamWorks Animation Media Review System, Thakkar says he additionally headed DreamWorks' [...] "high performance particle system rendering software" [...] and [...] "colour management system and software".|$|E
500|$|Disillusioned by a {{board that}} wanted to sell his best players without {{offering}} money to buy replacements, Shankly felt stifled by Huddersfield's lack of ambition and was delighted in November 1959 to receive an approach for his services by Liverpool.

[...] Shankly decided <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> offer as he realised the great potential at Liverpool, who were also in the Second Division at that time. Rumours began and were fuelled by Liverpool's visit to Leeds Road on 28 November. Although Huddersfield won the game 1–0, Shankly accepted the Liverpool offer and resigned his position as Huddersfield manager at a board meeting on 1 December 1959. His league record at Huddersfield was 49 wins and 47 defeats in 129 matches.|$|E

500|$|According to Ocias, {{the main}} themes of Loved were of {{dominance}} and power, but {{to provide a}} fuller answer would [...] "defy {{the point of the}} game". His intentions in making the game were to get people <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> games they were playing—a direction he found much of the video game industry shying away from. The confrontational aspect of the game was motivated by two aspects: primarily to use [...] "the resource of emotions" [...] invoked by its risk and reward mechanic; and secondly to absorb the awareness of people online. Expanding upon his inspirations, Ocias cited individual games such as The Last Guardian and , along with companies such as Thatgamecompany and Eidos Montréal, as showing [...] "greater depth" [...] to video games as well as experimentation and research. Ocias ultimately stated that while he dislikes [...] "force-feeding" [...] players, he would try to take a different approach both mechanically and thematically for his next game.|$|E
500|$|After {{deciding}} on Seattle for the setting, the developers began <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> superpowers that Delsin would possess.

Animation director Billy Harper considered Delsin's smoke powers challenging to design, as the team wanted to make powers feel more fluid than in previous Infamous games. They removed Cole's [...] "contorted hand poses" [...] to improve the connection between Delsin and his powers. Fox felt that smoke helps Delsin deftly navigate the game world by letting him zip up buildings and through enemies. Griesemer (who previously worked with Bungie on the Halo series) wanted to bring the fluidity of first-person shooters to Second Sons combat. The team reviewed the control scheme of previous Infamous games and [...] "removed some of the complexity that was preventing people from interacting with the game".|$|E
500|$|... "Paper Clip" [...] has {{received}} highly positive reviews from critics, who generally consider {{it among the}} best of the series. In an overview of the third season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Paper Clip" [...] was rated as A−. It was called an [...] "outstanding episode", although Scully's unwillingness to accept the paranormal after making contact was seen as [...] "exacerbat a maddening trend". Writing for The A.V. Club, Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode an A+. He felt that its strengths came from its parallels with real world history, such as its handling of Operation Paperclip and the actions of the West during the Cold War, noting that [...] "the compromises the United States and other Western nations made to survive the onslaught of communism in the Cold War were ones that should have made more of those nations' citizens take pause, stop <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> cost of living free, but they almost never did". The episode, along with both other parts of the story arc, were listed concurrently as the second-best episode of the series by Den of Geek's Nina Sordi. Sordi noted that the plotline [...] "laid the groundwork for the mythology arc {{for the rest of the}} series", adding that it [...] "brought much more significance to what is to come".|$|E
