40|$|There is {{increasing}} community {{awareness of the}} potential environmental risks posed by Cu-based fungicide use, which is placing increasing pressure on governments and industry to undertake risk minimisation action. However, if {{there is going to}} be a widespread move away from the use of Cu-based fungicides, logically there needs to be assurance that the alternatives pose a lower environmental risk. To that end, this study compared the effect of copper hydroxide, captan and <b>trifloxystrobin</b> on soil enzymatic (phosphomonoesterase and urease) activity. Compared to an untreated control, copper did not inhibit either enzyme activity, even at the highest dose used in the study (156  mg/kg). At their respective high doses, captan (96  mg/kg) and <b>trifloxystrobin</b> (144  mg/kg) did not cause inhibition of phosphomonoesterase activity but did inhibit urease activity. Consequently, the results from this study suggest that the copper hydroxide alternatives, captan and <b>trifloxystrobin,</b> do not pose a short-term risk to P cycling processes in soil, although the results do suggest that these two are more toxic than copper hydroxide to N cycling processes in soil. Moreover, captan and <b>trifloxystrobin</b> compounds are unlikely to pose a long-term risk to soil microbial function as they are unlikely to persist in soil at concentrations found to cause an adverse effect on urease activity.

Greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to quantify and model the duration of pre- and postinfection activity of fungicides most commonly used for control of hop downy mildew (caused by Pseudoperonospora humuli). In greenhouse experiments, control of downy mildew on leaves was similar among fungicides tested when applied preventatively but varied depending on both the fungicide and the timing of application postinfection. Disease control decreased as applications of copper were made later after inoculation. In contrast, cymoxanil, <b>trifloxystrobin,</b> and dimethomorph reduced disease with similar efficacy when applied 48 h after inoculation compared with preventative applications of these fungicides. When fungicides were applied 72 h after inoculation, only dimethomorph reduced the sporulating leaf area similarly to preinoculation application timing. Adaxial chlorosis, necrosis, and water soaking of inoculated leaves, indicative of infection by P. humuli, were more severe when plants were treated with cymoxanil, <b>trifloxystrobin,</b> and dimethomorph 48 to 72 h after inoculation, even though sporulation was suppressed. <b>Trifloxystrobin</b> and dimethomorph applied 72 h after inoculation suppressed formation of sporangia on sporangiophores as compared with all other treatments. In field studies, dimethomorph, fosetyl-Al, and <b>trifloxystrobin</b> suppressed development of shoots with systemic downy mildew to the greatest extent when applied near the timing of inoculation, although the duration of preventative and postinfection activity varied among the fungicides. There was a small reduction in efficacy of disease control when fosetyl-Al was applied 6 to 7 days after inoculation as compared with protective applications. <b>Trifloxystrobin</b> had 4 to 5 days of preinfection activity and limited postinfection activity. Dimethomorph had the longest duration of protective activity. Percent disease control was reduced progressively with increasing time between inoculation and application of dimethomorph. These findings provide guidance to the use of fungicides when applications are timed with forecasted or post hoc disease hazard warnings, as well as guidance on tank-mixes of fungicides that may be suitable both for resistance management considerations and extending intervals between applications...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of two fungicides, azoxystrobin and <b>trifloxystrobin,</b> and a plant defense activator, acibenzolar-S-methyl, {{for the control}} of tomato corky root and eggplant verticillium wilt, was evaluated under greenhouse and field conditions by means of dips, soil drenches or foliar sprays. The strobilurins provided excellent control of the two diseases under greenhouse conditions. Azoxystrobin was more effective than <b>trifloxystrobin</b> and reduced the severity of tomato corky root and eggplant verticillium wilt by 98 % and 95 %, respectively. Acibenzolar-S-methyl caused plant stunting and severe leaf chlorosis in the greenhouse experiments. In the field, azoxystrobin provided the best control. Tomato corky root severity was reduced by 83 % and eggplant verticillium wilt severity by 29 %. At the dosage used, acibenzolar-S-methyl was effective only in controlling tomato corky root. No phytotoxic symptoms were observed by any material in the field...|$|E
40|$|The eradicative {{effect of}} two strobilurin {{fungicides}} (kresoxim-methyl and <b>trifloxystrobin)</b> and difenoconazole on activity of apple scab spots was studied in greenhouse and field conditions. The reaction of mycelium and sporulation of Venturia inaequalis after fungicides applications {{were observed in}} light and scanning electron microscope. Mixture of strobilurin fungicide and difenoconazole applied twice, in 5 days interval, gave the best eradicative effect. The inhibition of sporulation was long lasting and it was observed even 3 and 5 weeks after treatments. The conidiophores, conidia and mycelium were damaged. Also difenoconazole showed good eradicative activity, in field condition up to 5 weeks after application. <b>Trifloxystrobin</b> significantly {{reduced the number of}} active scab lesions and the effect was visible even 3 weeks after treatment.

40|$|BACKGROUND: QoI fungicides, inhibitors of {{mitochondrial}} respiration, {{are considered}} to be at high risk of resistance development. In several phytopathogenic fungi, resistance is causedby mutations (most frequentlyG 143 A) inthemitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene. The genetic and molecular basis of QoI resistance were investigated in laboratory and field mutants of Botryotinia fuckeliana (de Bary) Whetz. exhibiting in vitro reduced sensitivity to <b>trifloxystrobin.</b> RESULTS: B. fuckeliana mutants highly resistant to <b>trifloxystrobin</b> were obtained in the laboratory by spontaneous mutations in wild-type strains, or from naturally infected plants on a medium amended with 1 – 3 mg L− 1 <b>trifloxystrobin</b> and 2 mM salicylhydroxamic acid, an inhibitor of alternative oxidase. No point mutations were detected, either in the complete nucleotide sequences of the cytb gene or in those of the aox and Rieske protein genes of laboratory mutants, whereas all field mutants carried the G 143 A mutation in the mitochondrial cytb gene. QoI resistance was always maternally inherited in ascospore progeny of sexual crosses of field mutants with sensitive reference strains. CONCLUSIONS: The G 143 A mutation in cytb gene is confirmed to be responsible for field resistance to QoIs in B. fuckeliana. Maternal inheritance of resistance to QoIs in progeny of sexual crosses confirmed that it is caused by extranuclear genetic determinants. Inlaboratory mutants theheteroplasmic state of mutated mitochondria could likelyhampertheG 143 Adetection, otherwise other gene(s) underlying different mechanisms of resistance could be involved...|$|E
40|$|Brown spot (caused by Alternaria alternata) {{is a major}} {{disease of}} citrus in {{subtropical}} areas of Australia. A number of chemicals, the strobilurins azoxystrobin, <b>trifloxystrobin,</b> pyraclostrobin and methoxycrylate, a plant activator (acibenzolar), copper hydroxide, mancozeb, captan, iprodione and chlorothalonil/pyrimthanil were tested {{in the field for}} its control. Over three seasons, trees in a commercial orchard received 16, 14 and 7 fungicide sprays, respectively, commencing at flowering in the first season, and petal fall in the later seasons. In all experiments, the strobilurins used alone, or incorporated with copper and mancozeb, were as effective as, or better than the industry standard of copper and mancozeb alone. The only exception was <b>trifloxystrobin,</b> which when used alone was less effective than the industry standard. Acibenzolar used alone was ineffective. Applying a mixture of azoxystrobin and acibenzolar was found to reduce the incidence of brown spot compared with applying azoxystrobin alone but, in either case, disease levels were not found to be significantly different to the industry standard. Captan, iprodione and chlorothalonil/pyrimthanil were as effective as the industry standard. The incidence and severity of rind damage were significantly lowest in the azoxystrobin, methoxycrylate, iprodione and chlorothalonil/pyrimthanil treatments. Medium and high rates of <b>trifloxystrobin</b> (0. 07 g/L, 0. 15 g/L) and pyraclostrobin (0. 8 g/L, 1. 2 g/L) applied alone were the only treatments found to be IPM-incompatible as shown by the elevated level of scale infection on fruit...|$|E
40|$|Husk spot, {{caused by}} Pseudocercospora {{macadamia}}e {{is a major}} fungal disease of macadamia in Australia. Chemicals to control the disease are limited and frequent failure to control the disease {{is a major concern}} to growers. The overall goal of this research was to improve the chemical control strategy of P. macadamiae through the provision of fungicides with different modes of action to carbendazim, which is the current industry standard. Husk spot incidence, premature fruit abscission, kernel quality and yield were evaluated following application of different fungicide products in replicated field experiments at three different sites. Results showed significant differences in disease incidence and premature fruit abscission between fungicide treatments, field sites and years. Generally, disease incidence and premature fruit abscission on trees treated with fungicide were significantly (P < 0. 05) lower than the untreated control. Pyraclostrobin conferred significantly better protection than <b>trifloxystrobin,</b> reducing disease severity by 70 % compared with a 50 % reduction by <b>trifloxystrobin.</b> The pyraclostrobin treatment had a similar efficacy to the current industry standard (70 % reduction cf. 73 % reduction by tank-mixed carbendazim and copper). Higher amounts of immature kernels occurred in the untreated control, followed by difenoconazole and <b>trifloxystrobin.</b> Diseased fruit accounted for 78 % of premature fruit abscission, which indicates that husk spot enhances fruit abscission in macadamia. Our results suggest that pyraclostrobin provided similar efficacy to the industry standard and could, therefore, {{play a key role in}} the management of husk spot...|$|E
40|$|The fate {{of three}} {{fungicide}} residues (fenamidone, pyraclostrobin, and <b>trifloxystrobin)</b> from vine to wine was studied {{to evaluate the}} decay ratio {{and the influence of}} the technological process. The aim of this work was to identify pesticides that can degrade rapidly or be eliminated together with byproduct (lees and cake) of the winemaking process to obtain wine free of residues. The disappearance rate on grapes was calculated as pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the half-life (t 1 / 2) was in the range from 5. 4 (1. 9 to 12. 2 (1. 2 days. The mechanism of dissipation of the three quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) fungicides was studied using different model systems. It was observed that the main mechanism responsible for disappearance was photodegradation. For active ingredients (ai) the half-lives of fenamidone, pyraclostrobin, and <b>trifloxystrobin</b> were 10. 2 (0. 8, 20. 1 (0. 1, and 8. 6 (1. 0 h, respectively, whereas for formulation higher half-lives were observed when epicuticular waxes were present (from 13. 8 (0. 2 to 26. 6 (0. 1 h). After winemaking, fenamidone, pyraclostrobin, and <b>trifloxystrobin</b> residues were not detected in the wine, but they were present in the cake and lees. This was due to the adsorption of pesticide residues to the solid parts, which are always eliminated {{at the end of the}} alcoholic fermentation. The data obtained in these experiments suggest that these three active ingredients could be used in a planning process to obtain residue-free wines...|$|E
40|$|Several {{species of}} powdery mildews are obligate biotrophs of crops in the Cucurbitaceae. These {{pathogens}} rapidly colonize green tissues via asexual reproduction and can negatively affect host physiology. We conducted a field experiment {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of organic and synthetic fungicides (registered and experimental products) for control of powdery mildew in pumpkin cv. Sorcerer. Following six weeks of fungicide applications, disease incidence (percentage of infected leaves within a plot) and disease severity (colony density on the leaf surface) was generally lowest in plants treated with synthetic materials (quinoxyfen, penthiopyrad, triflumizole, and mixed programs of triflumizole/quinoxyfen, myclobutanil/quinoxyfen/ <b>trifloxystrobin,</b> and myclobutanil/penthiopyrad/ <b>trifloxystrobin).</b> ‘Soft-chemistry’ materials such as paraffinic oil, tea tree oil, hydrogen peroxide, and the biocontrol agent, Strepyomyces lydicus WYEC 108, were less effective at managing disease when used alone. However, tea tree oil and S. lydicus substantially reduced disease incidence and severity when used in a program with quinoxyfen, suggesting that good disease management can be maintained while significantly reducing use of synthetic fungicides...|$|E
40|$|Immunochemical assays {{constitute}} complementary {{analytical methods}} for small organic molecule determination. We herein describe the characterisation and optimisation of two competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in different formats using monoclonal antibodies to the Quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) fungicide <b>trifloxystrobin.</b> Antibody selectivity was evaluated {{using a variety}} of agrochemicals and the main <b>trifloxystrobin</b> metabolite. Acceptable tolerance of the immunoassay to methanol, ethanol, and acetonitrile was observed in all cases, whereas a dissimilar influence of buffer pH and ionic strength was found. Moreover, the influence of Tween 20 over the analytical parameters was studied. The limits of detection of the optimised assays were below 0. 1 μg L - 1. Excellent recoveries, even at 10 μg kg- 1, were obtained when strawberry, tomato, and cucumber samples spiked with <b>trifloxystrobin</b> were analysed. Finally, statistical agreement was found between immunoassay and reference chromatographic results using blind-spiked and in-field treated samples. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} various {{fungicides}} on spore germination, mycelial growth, seed transmission, and infection by Septoria petroselini Desm., the causal agent of Septoria blight of parsley, were determined in this study. Eleven fungicides (azoxystrobin, benomyl, captan, copper oxychloride, kresoxim-methyl mancozeb, maneb, propineb, tebuconazole, thiram, and <b>trifloxystrobin)</b> were tested at various concentrations ranging from 0. 025 to 50 mg l– 1 in spore germination and mycelial growth assays. Tebuconazole {{was the most}} effective fungicide in all the experiments, with an EC 50 value < 0. 052 mg l – 1, followed by azoxystrobin, captan, and <b>trifloxystrobin,</b> with EC 50 values of 0. 053, 0. 06, and 0. 066 mg l – 1, respectively. Many of the fungicides were effective on spore germination in PDA medium at concentrations ranging from 0. 052 mg l– 1 (Tebuconazole) to 23. 032 mg l– 1 (copper oxychloride). Captan, mancozeb, maneb, and thiram were very effective at reducing spore germination, but were less effective at reducing mycelial growth, for which their EC 50 values were up to 735 -, 192 -, 192 -, and 191 -fold higher, respectively. Seed transmission of Septoria blight of parsley was controlled by tebuconazole, benomyl, azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl, and captan, which had inhibition rates of up to 95 %, 93 %, 93 %, and 66 %, respectively. Azoxystrobin, benomyl, kresoxim-methyl, <b>trifloxystrobin,</b> and tebuconazole inhibited Septoria blight in vivo, but captan, mancozeb, and maneb were effective at {{reducing the number of}} lesions only when they were applied before inoculation. Copper oxychloride, the most extensively used fungicide for controlling Septoria blight by parsley growers, was surprisingly the least effective in all the experiments...|$|E

In neither year did any soybean diseases develop enough to be an issue. Only NKS 51 -T 8 responded to a fungicide treatment in 2010 while HBK 5025 responded in 2011. Prothioconazole plus <b>trifloxystrobin</b> increased NKS 51 -T 8 yield by 23 % in 2010 while in 2011 the yield of HBK 5025 was increased 14 % over the unsprayed check. No yield response was noted with pyraclostrobin on any soybean cultivar. Only prothioconazole[*]+[*]trifloxystrobin applied to either NKS 51 -T 8 or DP 5335 in 2010 resulted in a net increase in dollars per hectare over the unsprayed check of the respective cultivar.

40|$|Powdery mildew, {{caused by}} Erysiphe betae {{is a major}} foliar disease of sugar beet in areas with dry and {{relatively}} warm weather conditions throughout the world. In the present study, four fungicides belonging to the relatively new class of strobilurin fungicides, azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl pyraclostrobin and <b>trifloxystrobin</b> were evaluated in three different application doses (100, 150 and 200 mg a. i. ha– 1) during 2003 - 2004 for {{the control of the}} disease. Among the four strobilurin fungicides tested <b>trifloxystrobin</b> and kresoxim-methyl were the most effective with control efficiency values higher than 94 % compared to the control treatment even when applied at lower application dose of 100 mg a. i. ha– 1. Azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin showed a poor to modest activity against the disease even when applied at the highest application dose of 200 μg a. i. ha– 1. Disease severity, in terms of AUDPC values was significantly correlated to decreased root yield, while no significant correlation existed among disease severity and sugar content of the roots or sucrose yield. In addition, the efficiency of tank mixtures of four strobilurin fungicides applied at 100 μg a. i. ha– 1 with two sterol demethylation - inhibiting fungicides (DMIs), difenoconazole and cyproconazole applied at 62. 5 and 25 mg a. i. ha– 1, respectively, was evaluated. The mixtures of azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin with either difenoconazole or cyproconazole provided a better control efficiency compared to the single application of each mixture partner, while the tank mixtures of <b>trifloxystrobin</b> and kresoxim-methyl with either difenoconazole or cyproconazole provided a better control efficiency compared to single application of difenoconazole or cyproconazole and similar control efficiency compared to the efficiency obtained by single application of the strobilurin fungicides...|$|E
