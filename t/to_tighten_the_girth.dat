60|$|The horses {{started at}} the outburst, and some broke away. Never were a body of troops in an enemy's country so {{unprepared}} for the attack. Not a carbine was loaded! not a sentry placed! Each of the troopers, including the officer, was seized with a wild panic, and thought only of flight,--one indeed had fallen at the first shot. The prince's horse was ill-tempered and badly broken, and, frightened by the firing and yells, he was so restive that the prince was unable to mount. Had {{one of those men}} stood for an instant at his head the prince might have gained his saddle, but all had galloped away, leaving him alone. Running by his horse, he in vain endeavoured to mount; he had not had time <b>to</b> <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> <b>girth,</b> the saddle slipped round, and the horse galloped away. Unfortunately the prince's revolvers were in the holsters, so he was unarmed, save with his sword, and with this he stood bravely at bay, and died nobly facing his foes, who pierced him with assegais at a distance.|$|E

60|$|The uneasiness of the peddler {{increased}} {{in a manner}} for which nothing apparent could account; his eye was constantly wandering towards {{the lower end of}} the vale as if in expectation of some interruption from that quarter. At length Caesar appeared, leading the noble beast which was to bear the weight of the traveler. The peddler officiously assisted <b>to</b> <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> <b>girths,</b> and fasten <b>the</b> blue cloak and valise to the mailstraps.|$|R
60|$|Just {{now with}} the rose in her brown cheeks, her hair flying, her eyes with grave instead of mocking light, she seemed only prettier than usual. I got down ostensibly <b>to</b> <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> saddle <b>girths</b> on her horse. But I lingered over the task.|$|R

60|$|Honora went {{behind them}} {{to witness the}} operation, which was not devoid of excitement. The great beast plunged savagely when they <b>tightened</b> <b>the</b> <b>girths,</b> and closed his teeth obstinately against the bit; but the farmer held firmly to his nose and shut off his wind. They led him out from the barn floor.|$|R

50|$|Distribution of {{flocking}} can {{be tested}} by running the hands down the panels while applying slight pressure. If the panels are stuffed unevenly (one panel higher than the other, or stuffing that is hard and lumpy rather than smooth), the saddle will have pressure points and could cause soreness. A saddle fitter can {{check to make sure}} see if the panels are correctly stuffed for the horse. The front panels should have pressure evenly distributed down their front, which {{can be tested}} by saddling <b>the</b> horse, <b>tightening</b> <b>the</b> <b>girth,</b> running <b>the</b> hands down the front panels to feel for even pressure. The back panels should not rise off the horse's back when it is ridden.|$|R

60|$|A few evenings later, Lilian {{dismounted}} {{from her}} pony {{in the shadow}} of a copse. For some reason she had been restless all day, and sought solace in a ride across the moor. The saddle had slipped a little, and she spent some time <b>tightening</b> <b>the</b> <b>girth.</b> Meanwhile two men came to a standstill in the stubble beyond the hedge, and she recognized Carsluith Maxwell in one spare figure. The sunset beat into his face, and she saw it was stamped with a curious melancholy as he looked down the deep-wooded valley toward Culmeny. Ridges of brown moorland, whose slopes were streaked by dark firs, hemmed the hollow in, and the tower rose blackly in the mouth of it against the shimmer of the sea.|$|R

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} the size of deductibles in the basic health insurance in Switzerland on the probability of a doctor visit. We employ nonparametric bounding techniques to minimise statistical assumptions. In order <b>to</b> <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> bounds we consider three further assumptions: mean independence of an instrument, monotone treatment response, and monotone treatment selection. Under the first two assumptions we are able to bound the treatment effect of high deductibles compared to low deductibles below zero. Adding the third assumption allows <b>to</b> <b>tighten</b> <b>the</b> bounds further. We conclude that there is a negative treatment effect...|$|R
