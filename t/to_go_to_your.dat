500|$|On 4 July 1947, Liaquat asked Mountbatten on Jinnah's behalf to {{recommend}} to the British king, George VI, that Jinnah be appointed Pakistan's first governor-general. This request angered Mountbatten, who {{had hoped to}} have that position in both dominions—he would be India's first post-independence governor-general—but Jinnah felt that Mountbatten {{would be likely to}} favour the new Hindu-majority state because of his closeness to Nehru. In addition, the governor-general would initially be a powerful figure, and Jinnah did not trust anyone else to take that office. Although the Boundary Commission, led by British lawyer Sir Cyril Radcliffe, had not yet reported, there were already massive movements of populations between the nations-to-be, as well as sectarian violence. [...] Jinnah arranged to sell his house in Bombay and procured a new one in Karachi. On 7 August, Jinnah, with his sister and close staff, flew from Delhi to Karachi in Mountbatten's plane, and as the plane taxied, he was heard to murmur, [...] "That's the end of that." [...] On 11 August, he presided over the new constituent assembly for Pakistan at Karachi, and addressed them, [...] "You are free; you are free <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> temples, you are free <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> mosques or to any other place of worship in this State of Pakistan... You may belong to any religion or caste or creed—that {{has nothing to do with}} the business of the State ... I think we should keep that in front of us as our ideal and you will find that in course of time Hindus would cease to be Hindus and Muslims would cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, because that is the personal faith of each individual, but in the political sense as citizens of the State." [...] On 14 August, Pakistan became independent; Jinnah led the celebrations in Karachi. One observer wrote, [...] "here indeed is Pakistan's King Emperor, Archbishop of Canterbury, Speaker and Prime Minister concentrated into one formidable Quaid-e-Azam." ...|$|E
500|$|Raising {{a family}} {{is not an easy}} task, and {{deciding}} {{to go back to school}} while raising a family can be a monumentual decision for the family says Carol Jacobs of the Jewish Employ-ment & Vocational Service. Her advice to those considering going back to school is, [...] "Talk to an educational consultant and people in the field you want to be in." [...] She adds, [...] "This is a commitment and the decision should involve your family. Will you be available <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> child's softball game or have time to cook dinner?" [...] There are many reasons why someone may put off to school until their children are older, such as not wanting to leave them in the hand of a baby sitter constantly at such a young age. However, once the children get older the parent pursuing an education, may start missing school events that they would have normally attended. The guilt of having to leave a child while attending to educational matters is less when the child is old enough to be able to ask questions about where their parent is and comprehend the response. Even though pursuing an education while nurturing a family will have its cost, the benefits include getting a higher paying job, gaining more knowledge, and becoming more stable financially. Most of the time this burden will include the person trying to balance a job along with their family and schooling, because they still need to work in order to provide for their family at the present moment. For people who have a hard time fitting classes into their schedule around the needs of their family, there are options where they will be required to do all of the work for a course, but it will all take place online. For example, the University of Delaware and the University of Phoenix Online have both Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Master of Science in Nursing programs for people to complete online.|$|E
