40|$|In {{communication}} systems, satellites provide {{two important}} types of function: the interconnection of isolated regional networks, and {{the connection of}} remote users to regional networks. To support multimedia communications, satellite systems {{have been developed to}} interconnect B-ISDN networks or add multimedia services to traditional <b>satellite</b> <b>connections.</b> This paper presents work on the development of <b>satellite</b> <b>connections</b> for multimedia communications based on two European projects...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{refers to}} the {{improvement}} of data transfer through <b>satellite</b> <b>connections.</b> In <b>satellite</b> networks, data transfers using the Transfer Control Protocol (TCP), suffer from the large propagation delay normally anticipated in <b>satellite</b> <b>connections.</b> Actually, a series of simple and inexpensive modifications to the TCP protocol settings, which greatly improve data transfers through satellite are described in the next pages. The presented work concentrates in Digital Video Broadcasting with Return Channel through Satellite (DVB-RCS) networks in which two-hop, interactive <b>satellite</b> <b>connections</b> between <b>Satellite</b> Interactive Terminals (SITs) are used. Test results regarding the applied modifications are also presented. The results indicate that data transfer is greatly improved using the aforementioned modifications...|$|R

50|$|At last, in 1979, channel 8 {{returned}} to the air under agreement with the Instituto Politécnico Nacional, through which XHUS rebroadcast its Canal Once via microwave link. This {{was replaced by a}} <b>satellite</b> <b>connection</b> in 1981.|$|R
50|$|The {{application}} {{does not}} require connection to Internet data (e.g. 3G, 4G, WiFi, etc.) and uses a GPS <b>satellite</b> <b>connection</b> to determine its location. Routes are calculated and plotted based on real-time traffic information provided by Inrix.|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare if non-physician, inexperienced {{ultrasound}} subjects can take quality diagnostic images after watching a brief educational video and using reference cue cards (autonomous group) versus taking ultrasound images with expert guidance using a <b>satellite</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{set-top box}} or digital video {{recorder}} (DVR) provided by the cable or satellite company or an independent party like TiVo, which has Internet capabilities {{in addition to its}} primary function of receiving and recording programming from the non-Internet cable or <b>satellite</b> <b>connection</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|... skyDSL {{operates}} {{its service}} by running the downstream <b>connection</b> over a <b>satellite</b> <b>connection,</b> while the upstream connection is handled by a modem or ISDN line. skyDSL 2 offers a 100% satellite solution for those lacking phone lines, {{a common problem}} in many communities.|$|R

50|$|In mid-February 2011 the Muammar Gaddafi {{government}} severed Internet {{access and}} international phone calls in eastern Libya {{in response to}} violent protests.

50|$|Often, nonstandard IP stacks {{are used}} to address the latency and {{asymmetry}} problems of the <b>satellite</b> <b>connection.</b> As with one-way receive systems, data sent over the satellite link is generally also encrypted, as otherwise it would be accessible to anyone with a satellite receiver.|$|R

30|$|Besides {{optimizing}} the connectivity of {{a particular}} train, it can also try to optimize bandwidth utilization for the whole fleet, by e.g., not using a medium that is shared amongst the complete fleet (e.g., <b>satellite</b> <b>connection)</b> when it has enough capacity available on other wireless links.|$|R
50|$|A server {{installed}} onboard {{manages the}} <b>satellite</b> <b>connection</b> and routes the data traffic while also compressing and decompressing all data transmitted, including GSM phone calls that are recoded using the AMR codec which reduces bandwidth {{while maintaining a}} voice quality virtually indistinguishable from the native GSM codec.|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} {{example of}} a system where the bandwidth-delay product is large is that of GEO <b>satellite</b> <b>connections,</b> where end-to-end delivery time is very high and link throughput may also be high. The high end-to-end delivery time makes life difficult for stop-and-wait protocols and applications that assume rapid end-to-end response.|$|R

50|$|Many IP-over-satellite {{implementations}} use paired {{proxy servers}} at both endpoints so that certain communications between clients and servers need {{not to accept}} the latency inherent in a <b>satellite</b> <b>connection.</b> For similar reasons, there exist special Virtual private network (VPN) implementations designed for use over satellite links because standard VPN software cannot handle the long packet travel times.|$|R
