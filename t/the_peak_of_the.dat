5|$|After it {{was decided}} that {{passenger}} transport on the railway was to be terminated, both NSB's bus division and other private companies, particularly Sverre Hage, wanted to have the concession to operate the line.

At <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflict, NSB's operations were at one point stopped by the police, although in the end, the concession was granted to them. As a response, Haga applied for concession to operate passenger transport on the railway, but this was denied by the authorities. The transfer to bus operations increased the ticket prices and travel time.|$|E

5|$|Although {{underlain}} by {{much older}} Triassic age formations that protrude to form what would {{once have been}} islands—such as Athelney, Brent Knoll, Burrow Mump and Glastonbury Tor, which is composed of Blue Lias, the lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000years, {{following the end of}} the last ice age. As the sea level changed following the Pliocene era, vegetation was laid down which was later converted into peat. <b>The</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peat formation took place in swamp conditions around 6,000years ago, although in some areas it continued into medieval times.|$|E

5|$|August 10, 1976– Prior to {{the arrival}} of Hurricane Belle from the south, 250,000 {{evacuate}} from the shore during <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tourist season. While paralleling the coast just offshore, it causes winds of 65mph (105km/h) and gusts of up to 90mph (145km/h), along with a maximum rainfall total of 3.93inches (9.98cm) in Cape May Court House. In addition, the hurricane causes a storm surge of 8.85feet (2.70m) in Atlantic City. However, damage is less than expected, and no deaths occur.|$|E

30|$|The {{short-term}} strain {{analysis revealed}} the dilatation rate change by repeating SSEs. The 3 -month strain {{analysis showed that}} <b>the</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> positive dilatation rate increased for every 6 -month interval (Fig.  5 b). <b>The</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> positive dilatation rate correspond to <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SSEs. <b>The</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dilatation rate were 0.2 – 0.4  ppm year− 1 (Fig.  5 b), and <b>the</b> directions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> extensional strain rate were generally in the north–south direction. The short-term shear strain rate reached <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> when a SSE occurred. However, it sometimes reached a <b>peak</b> between <b>the</b> SSEs. In this period, the compressional strain for the N–S direction was dominant in the Yaeyama Islands, which suggests that this compressional strain rate corresponds to <b>the</b> accumulation <b>of</b> stress between <b>the</b> SSEs.|$|R

In 2010, at <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rare-earths shortage, the price of scandium rose to over 15,000 US dollars per kilogram, and the widely commercially used scandium oxide (Sc2O3) was selling above 7 000 US dollars per kilogram.

Against advice from Peng and other senior military leaders, Mao ordered the PVA to invade South Korea—a mission that was beyond the Chinese military's abilities while breaking the fragile Chinese supply lines. Recognizing the Chinese difficulties, Ridgway then led the Eighth Army to inflict severe losses on the PVA during the Chinese offensives of 1951.|$|E
