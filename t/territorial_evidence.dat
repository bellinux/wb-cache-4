40|$|The ESPON Monitoring Report {{presents}} <b>territorial</b> <b>evidence</b> on {{the progress}} Europe has made towards the orientations of the Territorial Agenda 2020. It also explores how the recent development trends {{may have contributed to}} the achievement of Europe 2020 objectives. Each chapter focuses of territorial trends for one of each of the six policy priorities of the Territorial Agenda 2020, and starts with a short section on the interpretation of the policy priority. Hereafter, the latest related <b>territorial</b> <b>evidence</b> is presented, in order to support the understanding of to what degree Europe is progressing towards the policy orientation in question. A range of maps and figures illustrate the text and, when relevant, territorial trends and developments are discussed in different time perspectives, e. g. before and after the current crisis. The final section of each chapter sums up the territorial observations in light of the policy priorities addressed. An executive summary is presented before the six individual chapters, including highlights in short of the publication to support an easy uptake by policy makers of key messages presented...|$|E
40|$|Starting from a {{critical}} review of the literature, this paper discusses what the models the European policy actions should adopt {{in order not to}} compromise the results that the implemented austerity measures have so far obtained. Multilevel experiences (at different geographical scales) from several 2013 programs (mainly ESPON and URBACT) are summarised below to support this thesis, orienting towards the cities’ role within the cohesive developing policy. In order to assess this stance, territorial cohesive capability is used as it has proved to be {{the most effective way to}} transform European challenges into common geopolitical goals, partly devoting the discussion to the effective compliance with Structural Funds objectives, declared priorities of investment and territorial regional capability. Examples of place evidence and socio-economic trends from countries, regions and cities are mentioned and compared so as to establish the potential distance between symbolic anticipated priorities and real potentials in the short term. To this scope, the 2020 political addresses to attract capital public and private investments towards cities will be illustrated by considering in particular Italy’s future role within Southern Europe. Detailed attention will also be devoted to the significance of European <b>territorial</b> <b>evidence</b> in relation to the European Union funding policy. This allows us to understand better the different impacts and effects produced by such European directives taking in account the relationship between <b>territorial</b> <b>evidence</b> and programming obligations aiming at increasing employment and income. A set of feasible recommendations provide viable, flexible, and effective answers to the existing needs for territorial investment in the short term...|$|E
40|$|Review of {{the state}} of the art in recent {{computer}} technologies and related cartographic software in support of ensuring an innovative cartographic language. The service provider is asked to review the state of the art in recent computer technologies and related cartographic software development in support of ensuring an innovative cartographic language. The service provider shall, based on this review, present options for modernising the ESPON Cartographic Language. The fulfilment of this task should not be limited only to more “traditional” cartography, but explore new options for adding new cartographic concepts, types of illustrations and computer animated presentations, that could support the presentation of the geography of policy orientations and forward-looking <b>territorial</b> <b>evidence</b> to the European territorial policy arena. The review shall lead to recommendations of cartographic technologies and techniques to consider in a modernised ESPON Cartographic Language. It shall be used as input for recommendations on new cartographic elements to consider in a modernised ESPON Cartographic Language under task 4 and 5. Three dimensions for an Innovative cartographic language will be explored in three directions:- Former Semiotic language combined with new technologies- Usability of the produced representations - Focus on added dimensions like interactivity, animation, multimedia, 3 D, etc...|$|E

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} develop an {{analysis}} of the <b>territorial</b> <b>evidences</b> of discussion on local productive arrangements, those clusters, using as spatial scale of the regional analysis, more precisely the Ourinhos Government Region. Form of industrial organization emerging in the 1990 s, the APLs express localized concentrations of specialized companies in the same industry and establishing partnerships among themselves and with other institutions, with varying impacts on the development and governance of cities. Far from exhausting this debate, we consider the model of APL as an alternative strategy for the development of territories and their small businesses, despite their financial and institutional weaknesses. Also, put hypothesized that there are potential clusters and agglomerations in the Ourinhos region that are still unknown and did not receive institutional and financial contribution of the state, staying on the sidelines of the economic benefits of local development, for which they are poorly organized or disorganized. Tracing the framework of national and local policies to arrangements and productive agglomerations, accentuates the way of development in clusters like that guided resources, institutions and local networks, dependent, however, the larger scales of government action. That said, we propose a methodology of analysis grounded in documentary and statistical data research (IBGE and RAIS) seeking to achieve the objectives of identifying the major industrial clusters in the region studied, recognizing its dynamism to local economies and relevance or not to consider some regional industrial agglomerations as APLs...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThis paper {{summarizes}} a {{study of}} changes in per-capita income, monetary poverty, and income distribution in 9, 045 subnational administrative units of nine Latin American countries between the mid- 1990 s and mid- 2000 s. The results largely support spatial convergence of mean household incomes, although the estimates indicate it has been slow. Territorial inequality {{is found to be}} persistent and reduces the pro-poor effect of local income growth. Although national-context specific, the estimates also indicate that territorial development dynamics are influenced by the structural features of the territories. In view of the <b>evidence,</b> <b>territorial</b> development policies in Latin America seem well warranted...|$|R
40|$|A {{huge number}} of {{geographical}} and economic theories and applied researches’ experiences inspire the adopting of common (semi-standardised) processes for sustaining long term territorial development (employment, inclusion, GPD growth). It appears like a urgent European Union {{need in order to}} stabilise appropriate territorial integrated strategic investments overcoming shock and sectorial measures of austerity (Junker plan). At the same time, it seems the unique solution for having to react to a pseudo global financial and economic war (geoeconomic and geopolitical play at no summa zero), focusing resources to maintaining the status quo. Starting from a critical review of literature positions, the paper discusses what modelling the European policy action should follow in order to not invalidate the efforts implemented by austerity measures. Multilevel experiences (benchmarking at different geographical scales) from several 2013 programs (mainly ESPON, URBACT, ENPICiBMED) are resumed to demonstrate this thesis. In order to assess and to measure this aim, territorial cohesive capability is considerate the main vehicle for transforming European challenges in common geopolitical goals. So the paper considers the Europe 2020 pillars and flags as a first turning point {{to be related to the}} territorial regional capability of transforming its diversity in cohesive and competitive development. Some words will be spent about the real compliance between Structural Funds objectives, declared priorities of investment, territorial regional capability, including complex and multidisciplinary variables as cohesion, sustainability and subsidiarity confidence in this evaluation. Example of place evidence and economic-social trends from countries, regions and cities are mentioned and compared for fixing the distance among symbolic expected priorities and real potentials at the short time. At this scope the 2020 political addresses by government declarations and obligations, the regional potential attractive capital, the city potential public and private investments are illustrate with particular regard to the Italy position in the Southern of Europe future. The dissertation in the whole pays particular attention to relate the significant of European <b>territorial</b> <b>evidence</b> with the European policy and funds (e. g. the programming for internal areas distinguished respect to the inner areas ones). This permits to better clarify the different impacts and effects produced from European addresses when the national/regional interpretation does not take in account the relationship between <b>territorial</b> <b>evidence</b> and programming obligations that should increase employment and income. Finally, a set of feasible recommendations are launched on the short time providing viable, flexible, proper, effective and resilient answers to existing needs of territorial investments. These are due because expectations of citizens in front of the current period of economic stagnation. The strategic investment, in principle, should help territories (mainly cities) in having major perspective to realise a territorial regeneration accessing to mainstreaming financing linked to the new Structural Funds, which define the perspective horizon of long term European challenges. They imply joint capitalization, which means not just a(nother) prêt-a-portrait concept, and triggers a multifaceted approach ("quick & dirty" ideas / solutions). Drawbacks so far relate to fragmented territorial intelligence and the need for a certain critical mass willing to get involved. We mean the creating models for strategic integrated sustainable planning by addressing the efficiency of technology across various sectors (energy, climate change, public services, accessibility and transport, etc.) in different typologies and dimension of territory. It means supporting territories with the development of ambitious and innovative challenges embedded in comprehensive territorial agenda...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Colonias are rural, substandard housing developments in South Texas. They suffer from deplorable living conditions, often without running water or sewage systems, unpaved roads and extreme poverty. Yet service providers and researchers have observed remarkable unity and cohesion among residents, prompting them to attribute a strong "sense of community" to these neighborhoods. This study compares cognitive evaluations of sense of community and <b>territorial</b> <b>evidence</b> to identify elements of the physical environment that may facilitate the development of a sense of community in two rural colonia communities. The theory underlying a relationship between sense of community and territoriality suggests that territorial functioning reflects the same types of attitudes that lead to a sense of community. It is apparent from these results that colonias exhibit both a positive sense of community and some evidence of territorial functioning. However, the evidence does not seem to support a relationship between the two. For a positive finding to have been made, the attitude inherent in a sense of community had to have met stringent requirements to be translated into a discernible behavior. Due to cultural differences, observers of territorial behaviors may {{not have been able to}} interpret physical traces left behind by territorial functioning. It appears that other characteristics of these residents, specifically their extreme poverty, may moderate the relationship. Colonia residents have few resources available to effect changes in the physical appearance of the home...|$|E

40|$|The {{last two}} decades have {{witnessed}} a surge in territorial cooperation arrangements across the EU. This paper engages with on-going academic and policy debates around the contributions of territorial cooperation. Addressing the well-recognised difficulties in evaluating their contributions, the analysis sets out a nuanced framework in which to evaluate territorial cooperation, which is sensitive to quantitative and qualitative results of cooperation. Crucially, the analysis focusses on the ‘maturation’ process of territorial cooperation programmes and proposes a framework in which key characteristics of territorial cooperation efforts are identified - motivation, scale, intensity, governance structures, as themes - as variable in accordance to different phases of maturity. The main argument is that maturation should be a key consideration {{in relation to the}} results that can be expected from territorial cooperation and how these can be measured. In doing so, the paper addresses a significant gap in the literature on territorial cooperation and a significant practical challenge for policy makers. The analysis focusses on INTERREG programmes; the EU’s primary policy instrument for supporting <b>territorial</b> cooperation. <b>Evidence</b> is drawn from data that was gathered as part of a three-year research project (ESPON TERCO) and consists of an analysis of INTERREG programme documentation. Furthermore, 35 semi-structured interviews with programme officials were conducted in five targeted INTERREG case studies: Flanders – Netherlands, North Sea Region, Czech – Slovakia, Slovenia – Austria and the Central Baltic Programme...|$|R

Different lines of thought on territorial dispute settlement in Latin America through international arbitratin and litigation. In recent years a growing literature on the resolution of territorial disputes vis judicial processes has flourished. Countries willing to setle their maritime and territorial disputes have a plethora or forum options available, including regional and global tribunals. Yet some states seem to prefer global courts over regional tribunals. What explains this choice of forum?

25|$|However, {{this model}} has {{generated}} some controversy, as others {{have argued that}} early bipedal hominids were instead polygynous. Among most monogamous primates, males and females {{are about the same}} size. That is sexual dimorphism is minimal, and other studies have suggested that Australopithecus afarensis males were nearly twice the weight of females. However, Lovejoy's model posits that the larger range a provisioning male would have to cover (to avoid competing with the female for resources she could attain herself) would select for increased male body size to limit predation risk. Furthermore, as the species became more bipedal, specialized feet would prevent the infant from conveniently clinging to the mother - hampering the mother's freedom and thus make her and her offspring more dependent on resources collected by others. Modern monogamous primates such as gibbons tend to be also <b>territorial,</b> but fossil <b>evidence</b> indicates that Australopithecus afarensis lived in large groups. However, while both gibbons and hominids have reduced canine sexual dimorphism, female gibbons enlarge ('masculinize') their canines so they can actively share in the defense of their home territory. Instead, the reduction of the male hominid canine is consistent with reduced inter-male aggression in a group living primate.|$|R
40|$|This book {{investigates the}} EU’s {{regional}} growth dynamics and, in particular, {{the reasons why}} peripheral and socio-economically disadvantaged areas have persistently failed {{to catch up with}} the rest of the Union. It shows that the capability of the knowledge-based growth model to deliver its expected benefits to these areas crucially depends on tackling a specific set of socio-institutional factors which prevents innovation from being effectively translated into economic growth. The book takes an eclectic approach to the territorial genesis of innovation and regional growth by combining different theoretical strands into one model of empirical analysis covering the whole EU- 25. An in-depth comparative analysis with the United States is also included, providing significant insights into the distinctive features of the European process of innovation and its <b>territorial</b> determinants.

40|$|How did modern {{territorial}} states come {{to replace}} earlier forms of organization, {{defined by a}} wide variety of territorial and non-territorial forms of authority? Answering this question can help to explain both where our international political system came from and where it might be going. In this dissertation, I argue that the use of new mapping technologies in early modern Europe was a fundamental driver of these monumental political developments. New cartographic tools altered how political actors understood political space, authority, and organization, reducing the wide variety of medieval political forms down to the unique territorial form of the sovereign state. Mapping and its use was necessary [...] though not sufficient [...] to drive the complex process leading to our world of <b>territorial</b> states. Using <b>evidence</b> from the history of cartography, peace treaties, and political practices, I argue that early modern mapping changed the fundamental framework of political interaction. Authority structures not depicted on maps were ignored or actively renounced in favor of those that were, leading to the implementation of linear boundaries between states and centralized territorial rule within them. These fundamental characteristics of modern statehood appeared first in the representational space of maps and only subsequently in political practices on the ground. My exploration of this relationship reveals that maps and their depictions were causal, not epiphenomenal, to the transformation of politics. The role of cartography in the formation of modern states is made evident when depictions in maps are compared against actual boundary practices and the language of peace treaties. Clear linear divisions between territorial political units, while pervading maps since the sixteenth century, did not become common in practice until late in the eighteenth century. For their part, mapmakers never intended to reshape political ideas and structures. Rather, their choice to depict the world as composed of homogenous political territories was independent of politics. It was driven by the dual incentives of a commercial market for aesthetically pleasing printed maps and the underlying geometric structure of early-modern cartography that is provided by the globe-spanning grid of latitude and longitude. Thus, by linking developments in cartography to political ideas and outcomes, my dissertation yields an analysis of the complex relation between technological and political change that acknowledges the importance of both material and ideational factors to the constitution of political institutions such as the state and the international system. My historical case also yields implications for how we might better understand transformative political change, particularly in today's globalizing international system...|$|R
