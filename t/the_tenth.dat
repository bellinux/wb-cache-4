50|$|Prior to 1674, West Jersey {{had been}} {{partitioned}} into five territories, each called a <b>Tenth.</b> <b>The</b> five <b>Tenths,</b> stretching from Assunpink Creek southward {{to an area}} inclusive of the Cohansey River, fronted the Delaware River to the west. On April 12, 1677, title to <b>the</b> Third <b>Tenth</b> was conveyed {{to a group of}} Irish Quakers, or Proprietors. <b>The</b> Third <b>Tenth</b> ran from Pennsauken Creek to Big Timber Creek. In deference to the Proprietors and the original settlers, <b>the</b> Third <b>Tenth</b> was called <b>the</b> Irish <b>Tenth.</b> From <b>the</b> Irish Proprietors William Bates, carpenter, of the county of Wickloe, and four Dubliners: Joseph Slight, Thomas Thackara, Robert Turner and Robert Zane each received a right to acreage. The amount of acreage was specified but the precise location would be selected by its owner upon arrival and subject to a survey.|$|R

5000|$|Setting {{the time}} {{involves}} writing the appropriate BCD values into the registers. A write {{access to the}} hours register will completely halt the clock. The clock will not start again until a value has been written into <b>the</b> <b>tenths</b> register. Owing to {{the order in which}} the registers appear in the system's memory map, a simple loop is all that is required to write the registers in the correct order. It is permissible to write to only <b>the</b> <b>tenths</b> register to [...] "nudge" [...] the clock into action, in which following a hardware reset, the clock will start at 1:00:00.0.|$|R

Once <b>the</b> <b>tenths</b> register has been read, updating will resume. It is possible to read any register other than the hours register [...] "on the fly," [...] making {{the use of a}} running TOD clock as a timer a practical application. If the hours register is read, however, it is essential to subsequently read <b>the</b> <b>tenths</b> register. Otherwise, all TOD registers will remain [...] "frozen." ...|$|R

5|$|Myrrha {{appears in}} the Divine Comedy poem Inferno by Dante Alighieri, where Dante sees her soul being punished in the eighth circle of Hell, in <b>the</b> <b>tenth</b> bolgia (ditch).

Myrrha's {{suffering}} in <b>the</b> <b>tenth</b> bolgia indicates her most serious sin was not incest but deceit. Diana Glenn interprets the symbolism in Myrrha's contrapasso as being that her sin is so unnatural and unlawful that she is forced to abandon human society and simultaneously she loses her identity. Her madness in Hell prevents even basic communication which attests to her being contemptuous {{of the social order}} in life.|$|E
