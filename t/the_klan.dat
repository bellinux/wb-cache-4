5|$|Evans became {{embroiled in}} several {{internal}} Klan conflicts that gained media exposure. In January 1921, {{he and a}} group of grand dragons expelled the publicist Clarke, who had been critical of Evans' efforts to involve <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> in electoral politics. Evans also clashed with Henry Grady, a judge from North Carolina who served in <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> from 1922 to 1927, reaching the rank of Grand Dragon. Before Evans gained control of <b>the</b> <b>Klan,</b> Grady had been considered a potential successor to Simmons. After Grady dismissed a Klan-backed law that would have banned the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal service organization, Evans revoked his membership. Grady subsequently leaked his correspondence with Evans to the media.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{sought to}} promote a form of nativist, Protestant nationalism. In {{addition}} to his white supremacist ideology, he fiercely condemned Catholicism, unionism, and communism, which were associated with recent immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. He argued that Jews formed a non-American culture and resisted assimilation, although he denied being an anti-Semite. Historians credit Evans with refocusing <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> on political activities and recruiting outside the Southern United States; <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> grew most in the Midwest and industrial cities. However, they note that the political influence and membership gains he sought were transitory. Some commentators argue that Evans was more focused on money and power than any particular ideology.|$|E
5|$|Although Evans {{had led the}} {{kidnapping}} and torture {{of a black man}} while leader of the Dallas Klan, as Imperial Wizard he publicly discouraged vigilante actions, fearing that they would hinder his attempts to gain political influence. In 1923, Evans presided over the largest Klan gathering in history, attended by over 200,000, and endorsed several successful candidates in 1924 elections. He moved the Klan's headquarters from Atlanta to Washington, D.C., and organized a march of 30,000 members—the largest march in the organization's history—on Pennsylvania Avenue. Evans' efforts notwithstanding, <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> was buffeted by damaging publicity in the early 1920s, partially because of leadership struggles between Evans and his rivals, which hindered his political efforts. In the 1930s, the Great Depression significantly decreased the Klan's income, prompting Evans to work for a construction company to supplement his pay. He resigned his position with <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> in 1939, after disavowing anti-Catholicism. He was succeeded by his chief of staff, James A. Colescott. The next year, Evans faced accusations of involvement in a government corruption scandal in Georgia; he was fined $15,000 after legal proceedings.|$|E
50|$|In October 1965 <b>the</b> US <b>Klans,</b> <b>the</b> Improved Order and <b>the</b> Dixie <b>Klans</b> {{were all}} {{identified}} as being members of James Venable's National Association of <b>the</b> Ku Klux <b>Klan,</b> a federation of semi-autonomous groups.

5|$|Cordray contested the Ku Klux Klan's {{right to}} erect a cross at the Ohio Statehouse after the state's Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board denied the Klan's request during the 1993 Christmas holiday. He argued that the {{symbolic}} meaning of the cross {{was different from the}} Christmas tree and menorah, which the state permits. <b>The</b> <b>Klan</b> prevailed in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on December 21, 1993, and erected a 10-foot (3m) cross the following day. The same board denied <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> a permit to rally on Martin Luther King Day (January 15, 1994) due to the group's failure to pay a $15,116 bill from its Oct. 23 rally and its refusal to post a bond to cover expenses for the proposed rally. When the same 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision to deny the 1994 permit, the state chose not to appeal. The following year <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> again applied {{to erect a}} cross for the Christmas holiday season, and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concurred with the prior ruling. The United States Supreme Court did not agree to hear arguments on the topic until a few weeks after Cordray resigned from his solicitor general position. After his resignation in 1994 he several times represented the federal government in the U.S. Supreme Court: two of Cordray's appearances before were by appointment of the Democratic Bill Clinton Justice Department and two were by the Republican George W. Bush Justice Department.|$|E
5|$|In August 1923, Evans {{participated in}} a Klan parade in the heavily Catholic borough of Carnegie, Pennsylvania, which was {{attacked}} by local residents. One member of <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> was killed; Evans declared him a martyr and hoped that the death would inspire new recruits. The incident gave a fillip to the Klan's recruitment efforts, but increased Stephenson's animosity toward Evans, on whom he blamed the incident. Stephenson's proclivity for ostentation irritated Evans. Although Stephenson left his official Klan position after a short tenure, under his leadership the Klan's northern supporters had begun to rival those in the South. He had been a skilled campaigner and demagogue, and he remained a well-known advocate of the Klan's platforms after resigning. Evans avoided publicly clashing with him, fearing that it would hurt the candidacies of Klan-backed politicians: Stephenson was closely involved in the successful gubernatorial candidacy of Indiana Klan-member Edward L. Jackson, and <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> members had significant electoral gains in that state in 1924, including the election of several candidates to the state legislature. After these victories, Stephenson showed further disdain for Evans.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1920s, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) {{reached its}} peak {{membership}} in the South and Midwest after a revival beginning around 1915. Its growth was {{due in part to}} tensions from rapid industrialization and social change in many growing cities; in the Midwest and West, its growth was related to the competition of waves of new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe. The KKK was strong in the Florida cities of Jacksonville and Tampa; Miami's chapter was influential enough to hold initiations at the Miami Country Club. <b>The</b> <b>Klan</b> also flourished in smaller towns of the South where racial violence had a long tradition dating back to the Reconstruction era. An editor of The Gainesville Daily Sun admitted that {{he was a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> in 1922, and praised the organization in print.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> U.S. <b>Klans,</b> officially, <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Klans,</b> Knights of <b>the</b> Ku Klux <b>Klan,</b> Inc. was <b>the</b> {{dominant}} Ku Klux <b>Klan</b> in <b>the</b> late 1950s {{and early}} 1960s.

50|$|Ku Klux Klan {{auxiliaries}} {{are organized}} groups that supplement, {{but do not}} directly integrate with <b>the</b> Ku Klux <b>Klan.</b> These auxiliaries include: The Women of <b>the</b> Ku Klux <b>Klan,</b> <b>The</b> Jr. Ku Klux <b>Klan,</b> <b>The</b> Tri-K Girls, the American Crusaders, The Royal Riders of the Red Robe, The Ku Klux balla, and the Klan's Blind Colored Man auxiliary.|$|R
5|$|After Evans {{sold the}} Klan's former headquarters, it was {{purchased}} by the Catholic Church. The Cathedral of Christ the King was later built on the site. Evans attended the building's dedication and spoke highly of the service, surprising many observers. His attendance at the service was his last significant public appearance as Imperial Wizard: he stepped down soon afterwards, having become deeply unpopular with members of <b>the</b> <b>Klan,</b> who {{felt that he had}} embraced their enemies. He resigned on June10, 1939, and was replaced as Imperial Wizard by Colescott.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, Evans {{moved the}} Klan's {{national}} headquarters to Washington, D.C., where {{the murder of}} Simmon's lawyer had received less publicity. To Evans' consternation, Stephenson also formed a women's auxiliary group. Evans and Stephenson subsequently exchanged allegations of sexual impropriety. Police charged Stephenson with the kidnapping, {{rape and murder of}} a young woman; he maintained that the charges were orchestrated by Evans. After a sensational trial, Stephenson was convicted of second degree murder and given a life sentence; the publicity about the leader's behavior caused thousands of members to abandon <b>the</b> <b>Klan.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Haynes was a prohibitionist, he was {{a critic}} of the Indiana Branch of the Ku Klux Klan, which was in the height of its power during the 1910s and 1920s. In letters to friends and fellow prohibitionists, he {{ridiculed}} the organization for using violent and illegal tactics to achieve prohibition, and accused them of hypocrisy for supporting many anti-prohibition Democratic politicians. Kokomo politics was dominated by <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> during that period and it is unknown if Haynes spoke publicly against the organization.|$|E
25|$|On November 25, 1915, {{two months}} after Frank was lynched, a group led by William J. Simmons burned a cross on top of Stone Mountain, inaugurating a revival of <b>the</b> Ku Klux <b>Klan.</b> <b>The</b> event was {{attended}} by 15 charter members and a few aging survivors of <b>the</b> original <b>Klan.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although {{membership}} in <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> {{was limited to}} men, Simmons—after losing control of the national organization—attempted to create a parallel white supremacist organization for women. Evans established a women's group and sued him. Evans won the lawsuit, leading to a public war of words with Simmons, whose lawyer was soon murdered by Evans' press agent, an event in which Evans denied complicity. In 1924, Evans paid Simmons $145,000 for a promise to abandon the latter's claim to Klan leadership.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> {{had four}} million members in 1924, the group's {{membership}} quickly shrank after Stephenson's widely publicized trial. The Indiana Klan {{lost more than}} 90% of its members {{by the end of}} the proceedings, and there were mass resignations in other states as well. Other scandals emerged, further damaging Klan enrollment. Although the Colorado Klan had seen strong growth, Evans asked the Grand Dragon, John Galen Locke, to resign after local corruption scandals in 1925 involving Klan members who served as police. Evans' request was poorly received by Colorado Klan members; local enrollment subsequently plummeted. He encountered difficulties with Klan leaders in Pennsylvania in 1926, after many of them concluded that he was too autocratic. In response, he revoked the charters of several local Klan groups and removed John Strayer, a state legislator, from his position of authority in <b>the</b> <b>Klan.</b> When the Pennsylvania groups continued to refer to themselves as the Ku Klux Klan, Evans sued them in federal court. Pennsylvania Klan members launched a detailed legal offensive against Evans and other Klan leaders, alleging misdeeds, including participation in kidnappings and lynchings. Evans' suit was unsuccessful and, as many newspapers reported the scandalous allegations aired in court, the Pennsylvania Klan suffered a serious decline in membership and support.|$|E
5|$|Anderson and Ward {{devise a}} plan to indict members of <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> for the murders. They arrange a {{kidnapping}} of Mayor Tilman, taking him to a remote shack. There, he is left with a black man, who threatens to castrate him unless he talks. The abductor is an FBI operative assigned to intimidate Tilman, who gives him a full description of the killings, including {{the names of those}} involved. Although his statement is not admissible in court due to coercion, Tilman's information proves valuable to the investigators.|$|E
2500|$|MTSU's {{original}} mascot was Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate General {{and early}} leader in <b>the</b> Ku Klux <b>Klan.</b> Because of Forrest's ties to <b>the</b> Ku Klux <b>Klan,</b> <b>the</b> mascot was later {{changed to a}} blue-colored scent hound dog named [...] "Ole Blue" [...] in the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|In 1990, the Invisible Empire, Knights of <b>the</b> Ku Klux <b>Klan,</b> <b>the</b> {{most violent}} of <b>the</b> various <b>Klan</b> factions, sued Fulwood and his client, the Center for Democratic Renewal, for {{defamation}} of character after they exposed <b>Klan</b> activity within <b>the</b> Blakely, Georgia Fire Department.

5|$|Baseball {{historian}} Bill James {{does not}} dispute this claim in apparently referring to Speaker and possibly Cobb, but says that <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> had toned down its racist overtures during the 1920s and pulled {{in hundreds of}} thousands of non-racist men, including Hugo Black. James adds that Speaker was a staunch supporter of Doby when he broke the American League color barrier, working long hours with the former second baseman on how to play the outfield.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{social changes}} during this period, {{especially}} the 1920s, {{led to the}} reemergence of the Ku Klux Klan in the urban centers of Texas, with their strongest presence in Dallas. As in other states, the new Klan was not outwardly focused on suppression of black civil rights, but instead supported traditional morality including opposition to bootlegging, gambling, and other vices that had grown during the period. Bigotry, though, was never far from the group's agenda. During the Depression, anti-New Deal sentiments among some leaders, such as John Kirby, led to their becoming loosely associated with <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> and its ideals.|$|E
5|$|Under Evans' leadership, <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> became {{active in}} Indiana and Illinois, rather than {{focusing}} on the Southeastern U.S. as it had done in the past. It also grew in Michigan, where 40,000 members, more than half its total, lived in Detroit. It became characterized as an organization prominent in urban areas of the Midwest, where it attracted native-born Americans competing for industrial jobs with recent immigrants. It also attracted members in Nebraska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington.|$|E
5000|$|Despite {{sharing the}} antisemitic and anti-black {{beliefs of the}} Columbians, Inc., also based in Atlanta, the two groups did not {{necessarily}} get along. One of <b>the</b> reasons <b>Klan</b> attorney Morgan Belser gave for the AGKs attempt to reactivate its charter was to squelch attempts by the Columbians or other [...] "radical groups" [...] to appropriate <b>the</b> <b>Klans</b> name. When a Columbian attempted to assassinate journalist Stetson Kennedy in an Atlanta courtroom in 1947, it was a fellow Klansmen, Ira Jett, who knocked to would be attacker out of the way.|$|R
500|$|Conceived by {{its founders}} as a {{continuation}} of <b>the</b> Reconstruction-era <b>Klan</b> (controversially linked to General Nathan Bedford Forrest), the revived Ku Klux Klan had been established in Atlanta in 1915. Evans joined in 1920, leaving his dental practice {{so that he could}} dedicate all his time to the group. In 1921, Evans was elected as [...] "exalted cyclops", a recruiting position sometimes referred to as kleagle, in <b>the</b> Dallas <b>Klan</b> No. 66. When he was elected, <b>the</b> Dallas <b>Klan</b> had recently received a [...] "self-ruling charter" [...] from the Atlanta-based leadership and was the group's largest chapter. That same year, Evans was appointed to the position of [...] "great titan" [...] (executive) of the [...] "Realm of Texas" [...] and proceeded to lead a successful membership drive for <b>the</b> state's <b>Klan.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rising {{nativism}} and illiberality {{also found}} expression after World War I in the reemergence and phenomenal growth of <b>the</b> Ku Klux <b>Klan.</b> Unlike <b>the</b> original Reconstruction-era <b>Klan</b> which was purely a southern phenomenon intent on holding the freed slave {{in a position}} of inferiority, <b>the</b> modern <b>Klan</b> formed active chapters in every region of the country and temporarily gained both respectability and political power.|$|R
5|$|Anderson and Ward {{exploit the}} new {{information}} to concoct a plan, luring identified KKK collaborators to a bogus meeting. <b>The</b> <b>Klan</b> members soon realize it is a set-up and leave without discussing the murders. The FBI then concentrate on Lester Cowens, a Klansman of interest, who exhibits a nervous demeanor which the agents believe might yield a confession. The FBI pick him up and interrogate him. Later, Cowens is at home when his window is shattered by a shotgun blast. After seeing a burning cross on his lawn, Cowens tries to flee in his truck, but is caught by several hooded men who intend to hang him. The FBI arrive to rescue him, having staged the whole scenario; the hooded men are revealed to be other agents.|$|E
5|$|In May 1871, Grant ordered {{federal troops}} to help marshals in arresting Klansmen. That October, Grant {{suspended}} habeas corpus {{in part of}} South Carolina and sent federal troops {{to enforce the law}} there. After prosecutions by Akerman and his replacement, George Henry Williams, the Klan's power collapsed; by 1872, elections in the South saw African Americans voting in record numbers. That same year, Grant signed the Amnesty Act, which restored political rights to former Confederates. Lacking sufficient funding, the Justice Department stopped prosecutions of <b>the</b> <b>Klan</b> in June 1873; civil rights prosecutions continued throughout Grant's second term but with fewer yearly cases and convictions. Additionally, Grant's Postmaster General John Creswell, using his patronage powers, integrated the postal system and appointed African American postmasters across the nation.|$|E
5|$|The fusion effort {{failed and}} Grant was easily reelected. Liberal Republicans {{were unable to}} deliver many votes, and Greeley was only {{successful}} in areas the Democrats would have carried without him. Federal prosecution of <b>the</b> <b>Klan,</b> a strong economy, debt reduction, lowered tariffs, repeal of the income tax, and civil service reforms helped Grant defeat Greeley. Grant won 56 {{percent of the popular}} vote and an Electoral College landslide of 286 to 66. A majority of African Americans in the South voted for Grant, while Democratic opposition remained mostly peaceful. Grant lost in six former slave states that wanted to see an end to Reconstruction. In 1873 Wilson suffered a stroke; never fully recovering, he died in office on November 22, 1875. With Wilson's loss, Grant relied on Fish's guidance more than ever.|$|E
