5|$|According to {{a legend}} {{recorded}} in the Greek hagiography, Jovan Vladimir built the church near Elbasan. Its location, deep in a dense forest, was chosen by God, and an eagle with a shining cross on its head showed it to Vladimir. After the saint was decapitated, he brought {{his head to the}} church, and was buried inside. A group of Franks once stole the casket with his miraculous relics. The casket turned out to be extremely heavy, breaking the backs of hinnies on which the Franks carried it. They eventually put it in the Shkumbin River to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea, but the river flooded, and the casket—radiating light—went back upstream toward the church. The inhabitants of that area took it {{out of the water and}} returned it to the church in a festive procession.|$|E

Eventually, the gods tire of his boasting and invoke Thor, who arrives. Hrungnir states that Thor is under their protection, and subsequently he can't be harmed while in Valhalla. After an exchange of words, Hrungnir challenges Thor to a duel {{at the location of}} Griotunagardar, resulting in Hrungnir's death.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to level keys, every level has one Primagen Key. The six Primagen Keys unlock {{the gate to}} the final boss in the hub area and require the player to use talismans to collect them. Talismans grant Turok special powers, such as allowing him to jump long distances or walk over lava. To use the power of a talisman, the player must collect a feather in a level and then <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> talisman chamber from that level. There are five talismans in the game and every level, except for the first one, features a feather and a talisman chamber. The Primagen key from one particular level usually requires the player to use the talisman from the next level, except for the Primagen key from the last level, which requires the player to use four talismans. Therefore, the player needs to re-enter some levels more than once to collect all Primagen keys and complete the game.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} Colnett arrived at Nootka Sound the Princess Royal had sailed to San Blas, {{arriving}} there about 13 November 1790. Therefore, {{it could not}} be returned to Colnett as required by the Nootka Conventions. The governments of Spain and Britain agreed that the vessel would be returned to its owners in Macau. Manuel Quimper sailed it from San Blas to the Philippines, stopping at Hawaii on the way. Another Spanish officer was to take the vessel from the Philippines to Macau. Meanwhile, Colnett, having finished trading on the North West coast also sailed to China via Hawaii. By chance both Colnett and Quimper arrived at Hawaii in March 1791. The two met. Colnett demanded that the Princess Royal be turned over at once, while Quimper explained his orders were to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Philippines. Colnett became angry and prepared to seize the ship by force. The quarrel was calmed by John Kendrick Jr. (sometimes known as Juan Kendrick) who had come to Nootka in 1788 aboard the Columbia Rediviva with his father John Kendrick, entered Spanish service as a pilot, and was now on board the Princess Royal. Quimper slipped away at a convenient time and sailed to Manila, arriving in June.|$|E

He began extensive touring in 1992 and, following a near career destroying disaster on the <b>Take</b> <b>It</b> <b>To</b> <b>The</b> Vertical tour of 1992 initiated a line-up that became known as The Deniz Tek Group. This line-up spent {{the next few years}} touring Europe, Australia and the USA, while releasing an EP and several albums (Outside, 444 The Number Of The Beat, La Bonne Route) Geographical difficulties became untenable in late '96 and the group split up. Deniz then continued with US based lineups and recorded albums with Wayne Kramer(MC5)(Dodge Main), skateboard stars Art and Steve Godoy (Golden Breed, The Last Of The Bad Men), a Montana-based trio (Equinox), an experimental electronic duo with Jimi Hendrix's sidekick and amplifier designer Dave Weyer (Glass Insects), east coast hard rockers (Deep Reduction and DR2 featuring Rob Younger), and live work including tours and live albums with the Rationals' Scott Morgan (Three Assassins, Powertrane) and surviving members of Sonic's Rendezvous Band (Getting There Is Half The Fun). Deniz and wife Angie Pepper (Passengers) recorded her album Res Ipsa Loquitor in 2001. Deniz continued to record and tour extensively in the late '90s, while Radio Birdman reunified and began to work again.|$|E

25|$|When {{the game}} begins, Ghost is searching among the {{detritus}} of Old Russia until it finds and resurrects the player's Guardian, {{who had been}} killed in an ancient battle. Ghost then guides the Guardian to a jump ship and they <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Tower. There, they meet the Speaker, who briefs them about the Darkness. The Guardian is then tasked to probe the nearby Cosmodrome, where humanity used to launch its forays into outer space, fending off Fallen enemies and eventually the Hive, who were thought to have been confined to the Moon. The Guardian discovers that an old Russian Warmind called Rasputin, an AI built to defend Earth, is still alive and acting with unknown intent. The Guardian also tracks down codes to raise an ancient Array to connect it to long-lost colonies throughout the Solar System, and finds that Rasputin is controlling the Array. They then set off to the Moon in search of a lost Guardian who was looking for a way into the Hive fortress. After locating his corpse and dead Ghost, the player's Guardian's Ghost discovers that the Hive are raising an army and plan to invade Earth. The Guardian quickly sets about disrupting their efforts, including shutting down a ritual that the Hive were using to drain power from the Traveler, destroying a powerful weapon called the Sword of Crota, and severing their long-distance communications. Around this time, the Guardian is contacted by the Exo Stranger, a mysterious woman who summons them to Venus to face a new enemy, the Vex.|$|E
500|$|... "Lift Off" [...] is a pop song {{mainly in}} 6/8 time, which {{features}} baroque strings and a chorus sung by Beyoncé, accompanied with synthesizers. The song contains horns and martial drums as Beyoncé sings, [...] "We gon' <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> moon/ <b>Take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stars." [...] Throughout the song Wests vocals are enhanced by Auto-Tune in some places. Seal provides backing vocals in the song, {{which according to}} Jon Caramanica of The New York Times were [...] "impossible-to-notice".

[...] Jeff Weiss of The Hollywood Reporter found an [...] "old NASA movie sample and Kanye showing off his tattoos and inflexible singing voice."

[...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the song [...] "is rescued by Beyoncé, who whips the chorus with a belt so powerful you'd think it insulted her mother." [...] Slant Magazines Matthew Cole also praised the song writing, [...] "'Lift Off' is a study in stylized blockbuster excess, with West's best fanfare since Encore eventually being drowned out by a simulated rocket launch that will sound awesome in your car stereo provided it doesn't cause your subwoofers to bust your windows." [...] Rob Harvilla of Spin found a [...] "hook so ridiculous ('We gon <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> moon / <b>Take</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> stars!') that only Beyoncé could sell it." [...] Michaelangelo Matos of The Guardian praised the song calling it [...] "bombastic". Digital Spys Robert Copsey put [...] "Lift Off" [...] on his list of [...] "Tracks to download" [...] from the album. Evening Standards John Aizlewood called the song [...] "rocket-propelled". Rolling Stones Matthew Perpetua commented: [...] "Beyoncé joins the boys for a synth-heavy banger that takes off like a rocket and eventually arrives at a spacey, blissful resolution. It all but demands a sci-fi music video featuring Beyoncé as a sexy astronaut." ...|$|E
