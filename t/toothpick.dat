5|$|Scully goes to Agent Robert Comer, {{whom she}} was forced to shoot after his attempt on William's life, and uses the alien {{artifact}} to heal him. Comer explains that Josepho believes a physical manifestation of God exists inside the spacecraft. According to an ancient prophecy, William is destined to become the savior of humanity, but only if Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is still alive. If he dies, William will instead lead the Colonists. Comer claims that Mulder was supposedly killed by the cult in order for the aliens to successfully invade; he tried to kill William to prevent him from causing humanity's destruction. Suddenly, a nurse and the <b>Toothpick</b> Man (Alan Dale) arrive and ask Reyes and Scully to leave. Comer ends up alone with the <b>Toothpick</b> Man.|$|E

5|$|William Henry Meredith (30 July 1874– 19 April 1958) was a Welsh {{professional}} footballer. He {{was considered}} one of the early superstars of football due to his performances, notably for Manchester City and Manchester United. He won each domestic trophy in the English football league and gained 48 caps for Wales, for whom he scored 11 goals and won two British Home Championship titles. His favoured position was outside right, and his key skills were dribbling, passing, crossing and shooting. A dedicated and extremely fit professional, his habit of chewing on a <b>toothpick</b> during games made him instantly recognisable.|$|E

When Josepho returns to the wreck site, the Overcoat Woman relates that the aperture of the craft began to glow when William started crying. The craft soon rises up out of the ground. Looking on the site from a distance, Scully and Reyes see the craft burst out of an enclosure and into space, lighting the ground beneath it on fire as it goes. The two find an unharmed William among the charred bodies of the cultists.|$|E
25|$|The {{predecessor}} of the toothbrush is the chew stick.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to study the effect of the interproximal use of fluoride (F) -impregnated and non-impregnated birch <b>toothpicks</b> on the degree of de- and remineralization of enamel and dentine in situ. Ten volunteers with complete dentures in the upper jaw participated. Each subject had four specimens: (1) sound enamel, (2) demineralized enamel, (3) sound dentine and (4) demineralized dentine; placed pairwise at two approximal sites (15 / 16 and 25 / 26) of the maxillary prosthesis. The study involved three test periods (A, B and C), each lasting 4 weeks. In A, the subjects used F <b>toothpicks</b> (impregnated in 4 % NaF) and, in B, nonimpregnated <b>toothpicks</b> 3 times daily. During period C, no <b>toothpicks</b> were used. Dentifrice or other F-containing products were not allowed during the 4 -week periods. Transversal microradiography was used to determine lesion depth (ld) and mineral loss (Delta Z). The results revealed that all the sound samples lost mineral during the three experimental periods; Delta Z for both enamel and dentine was less for A and B compared with C (p < 0. 01) and less for A compared with B and C for dentine (p < 0. 05, p < 0. 01). The demineralized samples also lost mineral, apart from dentine, during periods A and B, i. e. when F-impregnated and non-impregnated <b>toothpicks</b> were used; Id for enamel and Delta Z for dentine were less for A compared with C (p < 0. 05). Four weeks' use of <b>toothpicks,</b> especially F-impregnated <b>toothpicks,</b> thus reduces the demineralization of enamel and dentine at approximal sites in situ...|$|R

25|$|Eating rough foods (e.g., crisps) {{can damage}} {{the lining of the}} mouth. Some people cause damage inside their mouths themselves, either through an absentminded habit or as a type of {{deliberate}} self-harm (factitious ulceration). Examples include biting the cheek, tongue, or lips, or rubbing a fingernail, pen, or <b>toothpick</b> inside the mouth. Tearing (and subsequent ulceration) of the upper labial frenum may be a sign of child abuse (non-accidental injury). Iatrogenic ulceration can also occur during dental treatment, when incidental abrasions to the soft tissues of the mouth are common. Some dentists apply a protective layer of petroleum jelly to the lips before carrying out dental work to minimize the number of incidental injuries.|$|E

25|$|To {{ensure the}} pCas9cr4 plasmid was first {{successfully}} {{admitted to the}} cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing chloramphenicol; the pCas9cr4 plasmid contained the gene cmr, conferring resistance to chloramphenicol, which ensured only the successful recombinants grew. Triplicate plates of 10μL of recovered cultures as well as dilutions of 10−1, 10−2, and 10−3 were then spotted and incubated overnight at 30°C and CFU, or colony forming unit, assessments were then made to identify successful mutants using the miniaturized plating method described previously. Once the mutation of interest was screened using overnight growth on M9 minimal medium plates supplemented with glycerol, chloroacetate and SOC (super optimal broth with catabolite repression), colonies were patched onto selective plates using a <b>toothpick</b> and incubated at 30°C for two nights. After sufficient colony growth, cells were transfected with the pKDsg-XXX plasmid containing the aada gene, {{and as a result}} were resistant to the aminoglycosides spectinomycin and streptomycin. To ensure that the pKDsg-XXX plasmid was successfully admitted to the cells, the cells were grown on a plate containing both chloramphenicol and spectinomycin to select for cells containing both the pCas9cr4 and pKDsg-XXX plasmids.|$|E

40|$|Although {{dental health}} has {{improved}} {{during the last}} 40 - 50 years, approximal caries still constitutes a problem in many age groups. It is important that fluoride (F) toothpaste is used when brushing the teeth. In some subjects, {{there may be a}} need for supplementary F products, especially in the caries-prone approximal area. Aim: The aims of this thesis were: i) to study the F release of F-containing approximal oral hygiene aids both in vitro and in vivo, ii) to evaluate different methods for the administration of F in vivo, iii) to study the effect of the frequent use of F-containing <b>toothpicks</b> and floss on demineralised enamel and dentine in situ and iv) to evaluate recommendations and the use of oral hygiene products for approximal cleaning in a Swedish adult population. Material and methods and Results: The F release of 26 brands of <b>toothpicks</b> and floss was followed for 24 hrs in vitro. A large variation in the release between these products was found; in general, <b>toothpicks</b> resulted in larger amounts of F compared with floss. The release in vivo was studied using single and multiple fluoridated <b>toothpicks</b> and dental floss, as well as in combination with toothbrushing or a mouthrinse with 0. 2 % NaF. Moreover, the administration of F by an interdental brush dipped in 0. 2 % NaF gel (here called the “Inter Dental Brush Gel Method”) was evaluated. Approximal saliva was collected, using paper points, before and up to 60 min after treatment. Both <b>toothpicks</b> and floss resulted in enhanced F concentrations in vivo. An interdental brush dipped in 0. 2 % NaF gel and a mouthrinse with 0. 2 % NaF resulted in the same F concentration as after using multiple <b>toothpicks.</b> All combinations of <b>toothpicks</b> and dental floss with F rinsing resulted in higher concentrations than after only toothbrushing or in combination with brushing. The most optimal order was to use <b>toothpicks</b> and dental floss after toothbrushing and before rinsing. Fifteen adults with full dentures, in which demineralised enamel and dentine specimens had been mounted, were included in an in situ experimental caries model. <b>Toothpicks</b> or floss, impregnated with NaF and amine fluoride (AmF), were used regularly for four weeks. All the products inhibited continuous demineralisation - dental floss somewhat more than <b>toothpicks.</b> A reduction in plaque micro-organisms was also found. Recommendations made by dental staff in relation to approximal cleaning aids were evaluated by a questionnaire sent to 500 dentists, 500 dental hygienists and 1000 patients in Sweden. The ability to remove approximal plaque was also evaluated in 60 regular users of approximal aids. Recommendations by dental staff are mostly given to children and adolescents in order to prevent dental caries and to older individuals to prevent gingivitis and periodontal disease. Approximal plaque appears to be more easily removed by regular users of interdental brushes compared with the use of <b>toothpicks</b> and dental floss. Conclusions: The use of fluoridated interproximal aids appears to be important in order to reduce approximal caries. An interdental brush dipped in a NaF gel is an interesting method for increasing approximal F concentration...|$|R
