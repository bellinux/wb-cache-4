5|$|The {{civil war}} years of Matilda's life {{have been the}} subject of {{historical}} fiction. Matilda, Stephen and their supporters feature in Ellis Peters's historical detective series about Brother Cadfael, set between 1137 and 1145. Peters paints the Empress as proud and aloof, in contrast to Stephen, a tolerant man and a reasonable ruler. Matilda's martial reputation may also have contributed to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's decision <b>to</b> <b>entitle</b> his 1855 battle poem Maud.|$|E

In 1526, Joachim I had intervened when the Pomeranian dukes {{were invited to participate}} in an Imperial Diet in Speyer. The Pomeranian case was negotiated in Speyer, and high nobles of the Holy Roman Empire mediated the conflict thereafter. In 1529, the Treaty of Grimnitz finally settled the conflict, confirming and amending the treaty of Pyritz: In Grimnitz, Pomerania was confirmed as an immediate imperial fief, yet the Electors of Brandenburg had to be present at every formal investiture and were allowed to touch the Pomeranian flag during the process, furthermore they were allowed <b>to</b> <b>entitle</b> themselves as dukes of Pomerania with the exception of cases when both the Pomeranian dukes and the Brandenburgian electors were present.|$|E

Galileo considered his theory of the tides to provide the required physical proof of {{the motion of the}} earth. This theory was so important to him that he originally intended <b>to</b> <b>entitle</b> his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems the Dialogue on the Ebb and Flow of the Sea.

500|$|Shakira chose <b>to</b> <b>entitle</b> {{the album}} Laundry Service as {{she wanted to}} {{represent}} her passion for love and music, which she compared to soap and water, saying [...] "The reason I named it [...] "Laundry Service" [...] is because I've spent the year dedicated to my two great passions: love and music.

500|$|The head {{of state}} of the United Kingdom is the monarch, {{currently}} Queen Elizabeth II (since 1952). The regnal numbering ("Elizabeth II") caused controversy {{around the time of}} her coronation, because there had never been an Elizabeth I in Scotland. [...] The British government stated in April 1953 that future British monarchs would be numbered according to either their English or their Scottish predecessors, whichever number would be higher. For instance, any future King James would be styled James VIIIsince the last Scottish King James was James VII (also James II of England, etc.)while the next King Henry would be King Henry IX throughout the UK even though there have been no Scottish kings of that name.

[...] The Times, a newspaper which had previously condemned Etty as [...] "offensive and indecent", felt that [...] "though defective in some respects" [...] The Combat was [...] "a masterly effort" [...] that successfully fused [...] "the florid beauties of the Venetian school" [...] with the [...] "sober dignity {{and power of the}} Roman school" [...] and that compared with his previous paintings, which were [...] "too uniformly feeble in character and meretricious in effect <b>to</b> <b>entitle</b> them to any very decided praise", the painting proved Etty [...] "capable of maintaining a much higher station in art than we had been led to expect." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{was during}} this period that Babbage tried to enter politics. Simon Schaffer writes that his views of the 1830s {{included}} disestablishment of the Church of England, a broader political franchise, and inclusion of manufacturers as stakeholders. He twice stood for Parliament {{as a candidate for}} the borough of Finsbury. In 1832 he came in third among five candidates, missing out by some 500 votes in the two-member constituency when two other reformist candidates, Thomas Wakley and Christopher Temple, split the vote. In his memoirs Babbage related how this election brought him the friendship of Samuel Rogers: his brother Henry Rogers wished to support Babbage again, but died within days. In 1834 Babbage finished last among four. [...] In 1832, Babbage, Herschel and Ivory were appointed Knights of the Royal Guelphic Order, however they were not subsequently made knights bachelor <b>to</b> <b>entitle</b> them to the prefix Sir, which often came with appointments to that foreign order (though Herschel was later created a baronet).|$|E
