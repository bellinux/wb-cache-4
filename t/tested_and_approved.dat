25|$|Charles I {{inherited}} {{a settlement in}} Scotland based on a balanced compromise between Calvinist doctrine and episcopal practice. Lacking the political judgement of his father, he began to upset this by moving into more dangerous areas. Disapproving of the 'plainness' of the Scottish service he, together with his Archbishop of Canterbury, William Laud, sought to introduce the kind of liturgical practice in use in England. The centrepiece of this new strategy was the Prayer Book of 1637, a slightly {{modified version of the}} Anglican Book of Common Prayer. Although this was devised by a panel of Scottish bishops, Charles' insistence that it be drawn up in secret and adopted sight-unseen led to widespread discontent. When the Prayer Book was finally introduced at St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh in mid-1637 it caused an outbreak of rioting, which, starting with Jenny Geddes, spread across Scotland. In early 1638 the National Covenant was signed by large numbers of Scots, protesting at the introduction of the Prayer Book and other liturgical innovations that had not first been <b>tested</b> <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> by free Parliaments and General Assemblies of the Church. In November 1638, the General Assembly in Glasgow, the first to meet for twenty years, not only declared the Prayer Book unlawful, but went on to abolish the office of bishop itself. The Church of Scotland was then established on a Presbyterian basis. Charles' attempt at resistance to these developments led to the outbreak of the Bishops' Wars. In the ensuing civil wars, the Scots Covenanters at one point made common cause with the English parliamentarians—resulting in the Westminster Confession of Faith being agreed by both. This document remains the subordinate standard of the Church of Scotland, but was replaced in England after the Restoration.|$|E

6000|$|More than {{a hundred}} years before the date of its {{original}} charter (1514) the Corporation existed {{in the form of a}} voluntary association of the [...] "shipmen and mariners of England," [...] to which reference is made in the charter as being an influential body of long standing even at that time, which protected maritime interests, and relieved the aged and indigent among the seafaring community, for which latter purpose they had erected an almshouse at Deptford, in Kent, where also were their headquarters. This society had inspired confidence and acquired authority to establish regulations for the navigation of ships and the government of seamen, which, by general consent, had been adopted throughout the service. It was, therefore, of <b>tested</b> <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> capacity, which at length resulted in the granting to it of a charter by Henry VIII in 1514.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to propose a pattern towards filling the gap between demand for serious games on {{negotiations}} and lagging supply. A solution for dialogue-based negotiation games is described, to be defined by a human tutor and used in a virtual business environment. Design/methodology/approach – At first state-of-the-art game design patterns and e-Business process patterns are identified. Then following the genesis of a pattern, a design pattern for negotiation games is analyzed, described, <b>tested</b> <b>and</b> defined, based on mathematical game theory. Findings – Since context of training plays a critical role in the negotiation games, precise tutor scenarios need to be customizable to fit the organizational needs of education and training. On the basis of our research, a negotiation pattern is clearly defined <b>and</b> preliminary <b>tested.</b> Research limitations/implications – The result needs to comply with the limitations of current dialogue-based systems. Practical implications – The adoption of the concept will give business stakeholders a hands-on approach to learn, <b>test</b> <b>and</b> <b>approve</b> negotiation skills. Originality/value – This paper provides an original pattern for serious games about dialogue-based negotiation...|$|R
