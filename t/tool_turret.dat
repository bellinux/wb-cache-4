50|$|A lathe is {{a machine}} tool used principally for shaping pieces of metal, wood, or other {{materials}} by causing the workpiece {{to be held}} and rotated by the lathe while a tool bit is advanced into the work causing the cutting action. Lathes {{can be divided into}} three types for easy identification: engine lathe, turret lathe, and special purpose lathes. Some smaller ones are bench mounted and semi-portable. The larger lathes are floor mounted and may require special transportation if they must be moved.Field and maintenance shops generally use a lathe that can be adapted to many operations and that is not too large to be moved from one work site to another. The engine lathe is ideally suited for this purpose. A trained operator can accomplish more machining jobs with the engine lathe than with any other machine <b>tool.</b> <b>Turret</b> lathes and special purpose lathes are usually used in production or job shops for mass production or specialized parts, while basic engine lathes are usually used for any type of lathe work.|$|E

50|$|Simple CNC {{machines}} {{work with}} a single <b>tool.</b> <b>Turrets</b> can {{work with a}} large number of tools. But if even more tools are required, then ATC is provided. The tools are stored on a magazine. It allows the machine to work {{with a large number}} of tools without an operator. The main parts of an automatic tool changer are the base, the gripper arm, the tool holder, the support arm and tool magazines. Although the ATC increases the reliability, speed and accuracy, it creates more challenges compared to manual tool change, for example the tooling used must be easy to centre, be easy for the changer to grab and there should be a simple way to provide the tool's self-disengagement. Tools used in ATC are secured in toolholders specially designed for this purpose.|$|R
50|$|Tool holders: The {{tool holders}} may include chucks, cutter adapters, cutter extension, <b>tool</b> posts, {{indexable}} <b>turrets,</b> box <b>tools,</b> quick change adapters, arbors, and collets.|$|R

40|$|To machine {{a complex}} {{precision}} product, several tools are needed. These tools {{are placed on}} a <b>tool</b> <b>turret.</b> A tool must return several times to its original position. To attain a very high repeatability between the upper part and {{the base of the}} <b>tool</b> <b>turret</b> mounted on a precision lathe, it is preferable that the parts of the <b>tool</b> <b>turret</b> are statically determined in their contacts. This is attained by using a kinematic coupling. To attain the required stiffness this coupling is provided with a preload of 1. 5 · 103 N. The machining forces are typically less than 1 Newton. A special kinematic coupling, consisting of grooves and balls, was designed, made, and tested. By providing the grooves with self-adjusting surfaces, hysteresis is reduced to less than one-tenth of a micrometer. Maximum stiffness is aimed at by using cemented carbide, a material with a high admissible stress, at the contact points. Experiments show that this kinematic coupling, under a preload of 1. 5 · 103 N, has a static stiffness of more than 1 · 108 N/m in every direction and a repeatability better than one-tenth of a micrometer...|$|E

5000|$|After {{receiving}} the tool change command, the tool {{to be changed}} will assume a fixed position known as the [...] "tool change position". The ATC arm comes to this position {{and picks up the}} tool. The arm swivels between machine turret and magazine. It will have one gripper on each of the two sides. Each gripper can rotate 90°, to deliver tools to the front face of the turret. One will pick up the old <b>tool</b> from <b>turret</b> and the other will pick up the new tool from the magazine. It then rotates to 180° and places the tools into their due position.|$|R
50|$|As each <b>tool</b> in a <b>turret</b> {{press is}} {{relatively}} small, the press requires little power {{compared to a}} press manufacturing similar parts with a single press stroke. This allows the tool to be lighter and sometimes cheaper, although this is offset by the increased complexity of the turret and sheet positioning. Turret punches can operate faster per stroke than a heavier tool press, although of course many strokes are required. A turret punch can achieve 600 strokes per minute.|$|R
50|$|Wolseley was {{not then}} as {{specialised}} in its operations {{as members of}} the motor industry were to become. For other members of the Vickers group they were general engineers and they also handled engineering enquiries directed on to them by other group members. Wolseley built double-decker buses for the Birmingham Corporation. They also built many specials such as electric lighting sets and motor boat engines - catalogued sizes were from 12 hp to 250 hp with up to twelve cylinders and complete with gearboxes. Fire engines too and special War Office vehicles being a subsidiary of a major armaments firm. As befits a company with tool in its name they built macine <b>tools</b> including <b>turret</b> lathes and horizontal borers though chiefly for their own use or for group members. Very large engines were made to power railcars, those made for the Delaware and Hudson railroad powered a petrol-electric system.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A rigid-flexible {{coupling}} {{model of}} sliding guideway working in powered turret {{for a new}} developed multifunction NC lathe is built up based on Solidworks, ANSYS and ADAMS. A solid model of is built up by the 3 d-Modeling software Solidworks, and then the built model of sliding guideway is imported into finite element analysis software ANSYS to analyze elastic deformation. A mnf file of model generated by ANSYS which is a flexible body is fed into ADAMS to replace the rigid body of assembly. A dynamics simulation is conducted by considering a typical cutting processing like milling on lathe, the deformation of fixed guideway in working condition is checked. The analyzed results show {{that it is more}} rational and accurate to apply rigid-flexible coupling dynamic simulation for analyzing such mechanical system and this type of sliding guideway used in powered <b>tool</b> <b>turret</b> can stand up with cutting load and can meet the requirement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. As core {{functional}} {{components of}} the medium and high grade CNC machine <b>tools,</b> the power-driven <b>turret</b> involves high technology and complicated structures. Traditionally, {{in the study of}} low speed turrets ` performances, the effects of thermal influences are often negligible. However, on the high speed conditions, thermal effect cannot be neglected. This paper establishes the high speed turret 3 -D Model and the Finite Element Model (FEM), and investigates and analyzes temperature fields and thermal deformations. Experimental measurements are implemented on the surfaces of the original model turret in order to compare with the simulation results, modified turret is analyzed, and thermal behaviors are proved to be available on the idle operating conditions. It manifests that the distributions of the thermal behaviors have intensive relations with the speeds of the transmission system...|$|R
50|$|Punching, {{and press}} work in general, {{is a process}} well suited to mass production. However the initial tooling costs, of both the machine and the job-specific press tool, are high. This limits punch work from being used for much small-volume and {{prototype}} work. A turret punch {{is one way of}} addressing this cost. The <b>tooling</b> of a <b>turret</b> punch uses a large number of standard punch tools: holes of varying sizes, straight edges, commonly-used notches or mounting holes. By using a large number of strokes, with several different tools in turn, a turret press may make a wide variety of parts without having to first make a specialised press tool for that task. This saves both time and money, allowing rapid prototyping or for low volume production to start without tooling delays.|$|R
50|$|Commercial CNC {{metalworking}} machines use {{closed loop}} feedback controls for axis movement. In a closed loop system, the control {{is aware of the}} actual position of the axis at all times. With proper control programming, this will reduce the possibility of a crash, but it is still up to the operator and programmer to ensure that the machine is operated in a safe manner. However, during the 2000s and 2010s, the software for machining simulation has been maturing rapidly, and it is no longer uncommon for the entire machine tool envelope (including all axes, spindles, chucks, <b>turrets,</b> <b>tool</b> holders, tailstocks, fixtures, clamps, and stock) to be modeled accurately with 3D solid models, which allows the simulation software to predict fairly accurately whether a cycle will involve a crash. Although such simulation is not new, its accuracy and market penetration are changing considerably because of computing advancements.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} build of a multiple position turret used to simultaneously attach six end effectors to a four-degree of freedom Adept robot. The main objective of this thesis {{is to develop a}} prototype tool changer that is different, more cost effective, and offers more features and versatility than any other. Use of the turret allows the robot to quickly change the end effector in use by simply rotating any of the others into the ready position. This reduces the tool changing time in a high-speed assembly process that is normally associated with conventional tool changers disconnecting one end effector and picking up another. Employing the turret concept in a robotic assembly operation will also lengthen the life of the robot because there are fewer moves that have to be made by the robot itself. The turret is approximately 8 inches high, 7 inches wide and its turntable is 6. 25 inches in diameter. This small envelope is a large benefit over the bulky system that would be needed for the more traditional <b>tool</b> changers. The <b>turret</b> 2 ̆ 7 s weight while populated with six small end effectors is approximately 10. 5 pounds. The cost of the turret, not including end effectors, is approximately 5, 500...|$|R
