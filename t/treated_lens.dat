40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was {{to determine the effects of}} enzymatic digestion on the human lens, with the ultimate goal of rendering cataract surgery obsolete. A system for measuring the consistency of a lens, using an aspiration technique, was developed and was used to quantify the changes that occur in a lens after injection with one of four enzymes: pronase E, sphingomyelinase, phospholipase C, and carboxypeptidase B. Pronase was found to be the most effective enzyme with 20 % more of the <b>treated</b> <b>lens</b> aspirating when compared to the untreated lens. The amount of pronase injected and the incubation time were varied and the response of the lens was measured. Pronase and sphingomyelinase were also used in conjunction with phacoemulsification to determine if one treatment would increase the effectiveness of the other. No synergism was found between the enzyme treatments and phacoemulsification. Other enzymes and techniques are suggested for further study...|$|E
40|$|Aim: Allylmercapto{{captopril}} (AMC) is a covalently bonded {{product of}} allicin and captopril has been evaluated for its anticataract activity against selenite induced cataract in experimental animals. We wanted to evaluate its anticataract potential in galactosemic cataract to elu-cidate biochemical mechanism to appraise its activity. Method: We examined the protective effect of AMC in both in vitro and {{in vivo models}} of galactose-induced cataract in rats and compared the effect with captopril. We evaluated the effect of both captopril and AMC on onset and maturation of cataract in galactosemic cata-ract. Result: AMC reduced the rat lens polyol level, the marker of osmotic stress induced by galactose when compared with galactose treated and captopril <b>treated</b> <b>lens.</b> Glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, suc-cinate dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase activity and reduced glutathione level were decreased in the galactose treated group com-pared with normal lenses. AMC treatment significantly restored these biochemical levels compared with the galactose treated group. The second, in vivo {{phase of the study}} revealed that AMC treatment sig-nificantly delayed the onset and maturation of cataract in galactose treated rats compared to captopril treatment. Conclusion: These results support the view that AMC counteracts the effects of galactose in inducing cataract. The anticataract effects of AMC may be related to its intrinsic ability to protect and restore the activities of lens enzymes and the bioavailability of glutathione re-spectively...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} use of low {{temperature}} plasmas {{as a means of}} improving the surface properties of hard gas permeable contact lenses. It is important that the polymers used for this application should have good optical properties, should allow transport of oxygen to the cornea and be biocompatible, that is they should not stimulate an adverse response in the tissues which they contact. Whilst most patients have no problems with current materials there are a significant number who experience irritation of the eyes and abnormal build up of deposits on the lens surface. It has been found that mild oxygen plasma treatment of the contact lens can be helpful in alleviating these problems. In this volume the effects of such treatment are examined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and alternative treatments proposed. It is found that the oxygen plasma treatment increases the wettability of the lens surface by the incorporation of oxygen in the polymer. This effect decays with time but is not wholly lost on prolonged storage. The mechanism of this decay appears to be a migration of oxidized material from the surface and is dependent on the storage conditions. During this decay an anomalous transient increase in hydrophilicity was encountered which can be associated with the temporary return of highly oxidized material to the surface. This effect is observed in other polymers and can be shown to be temperature dependent. The use of plasma polymerization as an alternative treatment was investigated and a number of materials produced with similar surface properties to the oxygen <b>treated</b> <b>lens</b> material. It was hoped that a coating would be generally applicable to a variety of lens materials. *Adsorption studies showed that the oxygen treated material has the property of reversibly adsorbing glycoproteins which may account for its performance in the eye.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{in vitro}} methods for testing the toxicity of the surfactants, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and benzalkonium chloride (BAK), and Ultraviolet (UV) -B radiation to the bovine lens. METHODS: Lenses were dissected from bovine eyes [...] obtained from a local abattoir [...] and incubated in M 199 culture medium at 37 degrees C, with 4 % CO(2) and 96 % air atmosphere. For the SDS and BAK experiments, the lenses (n = 153) were exposed directly to 0. 001 %, 0. 01 %, 0. 1 %, and 1. 0 % solutions for 15 min. These lenses were then rinsed five times each with saline and medium. Another group of lenses (n = 36) was irradiated with broadband UV-B at energy levels of 1. 0 and 2. 0 J/cm (2) (0. 445 and 0. 89 J/cm(2) in the biologically effective energy levels). For {{all of the above}} experiments, lens optical quality and cellular viability of lens epithelial cells were evaluated. RESULTS: The analysis of optical quality, using a scanning laser in vitro assay system, of exposed lenses treated with SDS and BAK at concentrations of 0. 01 %, 0. 1 %, and 1. 0 %, and with UV-B at energy levels of 0. 445 and 0. 89 J/cm(2) showed a dose- and time-dependent increase in back vertex distance (BVD) variability, indicating loss of sharp focus in comparison with control lenses. Both 0. 001 % SDS and 0. 001 % BAK-treated lenses did not show any optical damage until 8 -days after exposure. Lenses treated with 0. 01 % SDS showed recovery from optical damage 6 -days later after exposure. Optical damage was not shown immediately for UV-B-exposed lenses. The Alamar Blue assay data for SDS, BAK and UV-B-exposed lenses, except the 0. 001 % SDS <b>treated</b> <b>lens</b> group, showed also dose- and time-dependent decreases in cellular viability in comparison with the control lenses, and there was no cellular recovery during the entire culture period. Lenses treated with 0. 001 % SDS did not show biological damage until 8 -days after exposure. It appears that cellular changes appeared earlier than optical changes. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that cultured bovine lenses can be evaluated by assays that probe optical properties and cellular function after exposure to surfactants and UV-B irradiation, and that the optical and biological assay methods are valuable for in vitro mild ocular toxicity research...|$|E
40|$|Homeostasis of {{intracellular}} calcium {{is crucial}} for lens cytoarchitecture and transparency, however, the identity of specific channel proteins regulating calcium influx within the lens is not completely understood. Here we examined the expression and distribution profiles of L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) and explored their role in morphological integrity and transparency of the mouse lens, using cDNA microarray, RT-PCR, immunoblot, pharmacological inhibitors and immunofluorescence analyses. The results revealed that Ca (V) 1. 2 and 1. 3 channels are expressed and distributed in both the epithelium and cortical fiber cells in mouse lens. Inhibition of LTCCs with felodipine or nifedipine induces progressive cortical cataract formation with time, in association with decreased lens weight in ex-vivo mouse lenses. Histological analyses of felodipine <b>treated</b> <b>lenses</b> revealed extensive disorganization and swelling of cortical fiber cells resembling the phenotype reported for altered aquaporin- 0 activity without detectable cytotoxic effects. Analysis of both soluble and membrane rich fractions from felodipine <b>treated</b> <b>lenses</b> by SDS-PAGE in conjunction with mass spectrometry and immunoblot analyses revealed decreases in b-B 1 -crystallin, Hsp- 90, spectrin and filensin.

Confocal micrographs of secondary fibre cells’ mitochondria were also analyzed for 50 μM, 200 μM, and 600 μM menadione treatment over 48 hours. Increase in BVD variability (± s. e. m.) was observed within 24 hours from 0. 28 ± 0. 021 to 1. 83 ± 0. 75 for the 600 μM <b>treated</b> <b>lenses.</b> Confocal micrograph analysis showed a trend toward a decrease in the average length of mitochondria from 7. 9 ± 0. 8 to 3. 7 ± 0. 9 over for 200 μM <b>treated</b> <b>lenses</b> and from 5. 9 ± 1. 0 to 3. 6 ± 0. 6 for the 600 μM <b>treated</b> <b>lenses</b> over 48 hours.

Methods: Excised porcine lenses were cultured in M 199 supplemented with 1 % antibiotics and 4 % porcine serum. After 1 week of pre-incubation at 37 °C, baseline measurements were taken. <b>Treated</b> <b>lenses</b> were irradiated with a range of UVB radiant exposures from 0. 019 to 0. 076 J cm− 2. The lenses were maintained for a further 4 weeks, with measurements carried out every 48 h in the first 9 days post-UVB treatment and then once each week. At each measurement session, <b>treated</b> and control <b>lenses</b> were transferred into a 24 -well plate, one lens per well containing the assay. The lenses were incubated for 50 min, after which fluorescence readings were taken with a plate reader. Results: Analyses showed significant (p < 0. 05) inhibition of lens metabolic activity and optical function in the 0. 038 and 0. 076 J cm− 2 UVB <b>treated</b> <b>lenses.</b> Lenses <b>treated</b> with 0. 019 J cm− 2 UVB did not exhibit any photodamage. Conclusions: These results suggest that the alamarBlue assay is useful for the in vitro study of UV-induced lens damage. The decrease in the capacity of <b>treated</b> <b>lenses</b> to reduce alamarBlue over time confirms that UVB photo-oxidation can cause diminution of viable lens epithelial and fibre cells.

METHODS:Totally 39 cases with traumatic lens dislocation who underwent surgery treatment were analyzed retrospectively from October 2011 to September 2012. According to different positions and degrees of the lens dislocation, different surgical managements were performed: intracapsular lens extraction, phacoemulsification, lens extraction through incision of orbiculus ciliaris. Meanwhile, the cases were associated with homologous operations according to different conditions, such as vitreo-retinal operations, anti-glaucoma operations.

40|$|Abstract-We raised {{chickens}} with defocusing {{lenses of}} differing powers {{in front of}} their eyes. For this purpose, small hoods made from soft, thin leather were carefully fitted to their heads. Lenses were attached to the hoods by velcro fasteners and could be easily removed for cleaning. The powers of the lenses were such that their optical effects could be compensated for by accommodation. It was verified by infrared (IR) photoretinoscopy that the chickens could keep their retinal images in focus. Wearing a lens resulted in a consistent shift of the non cycloplegic refractive state (measured without the lens) which was in the direction to compensate for the lens. We used a sensitive technique (precision = f 50 pm as estimated from the variability of repeated measurements) to measure the posterior nodal distance (PND) in excised eyes of birds grown with lenses. The PND, in turn, was used to compare eyes <b>treated</b> with different <b>lenses.</b> It was found that the PND was increased in eyes which were <b>treated</b> with negative <b>lenses</b> compared to those <b>treated</b> with positive <b>lenses.</b> This effect occurs independently in both eyes and it is not due to changes in cornea 1 curvature.

Mitochondria {{play a role in}} providing cells with aerobic respiration necessary for these metabolic processes. Using menadione, a mitochondria-specific inhibitor of the quinone family, and bovine lenses in vitro, this study was undertaken to determine whether a relationship exists between mitochondrial function and optical function. Methods: Bovine <b>lenses</b> were <b>treated</b> with 50 μM, 200 μM, 600 μM, and 1, 000 μM menadione and lens optical function, assessed as optical quality, was observed over 9 days. Confocal micrographs of mitochondria in superficial secondary fiber cells were also analyzed in 50 μM, 200 μM, and 600 μM menadione-treated lenses over 48 h. Results: A decrease in lens optical quality was observed in a dose-dependent manner within 24 h for the 200 µM-(p= 0. 0422), 600 µM- (p< 0. 0001), and 1, 000 μM- (p< 0. 0001) <b>treated</b> <b>lenses.</b> No change in optical quality was observed for the 50 μM-treated lenses.

Conclusions: The data show that menadione has a detrimental effect on mitochondrial integrity and this change is associated with degradation of optical quality, suggesting a possible link between mitochondrial function and optical function...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{compensation}} and minimisation of distortions in images. Various forms of non-linear lens distortions are modelled and removed. Projective linear distortions are further minimised {{to give the}} closest ideal projection from erroneous cameras. Traditional camera calibration <b>treats</b> <b>lens</b> distortion simultaneously with camera pose and lens scaling factors. This often leads to complex algorithms with multi-image requirements, while alternative so called non-metric methods such as straight line techniques, lack ready usability and insufficient precision. Considering the calibration and compensation of non-idealitys separately, allows greater access to error free projections while considerably simplifying subsequent calibrations. The major contributions of this thesis are the precise calibration and removal of lens distortions and the minimisation of perspective distortions. A simple to use technique is proposed for the closed-form calibration of lens distortion based on a single view of a planar calibration chart. Detailed examinations show its accuracy and suitability for all levels of lens distortion. A related method is proposed {{for the removal of}} lateral chromatic aberrations in images. Distortion models and approximate inverses are derived to give precise accuracy over all distortion levels including fish-eye lenses. An analysis of calibration patterns is conducted to determine if the choice of pattern can influence the accuracy of the calibration. It is revealed that only specific patterns offer truly bias free control points. Distortion free images are optimally regenerated to minimise pixel scale distortions. This technique is further developed to uniquely minimise perspective distortions, with application to stereo rectification...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a technique to induce the transformation of somatic cells to a pluripotent state via the ectopic expression of defined transcription factors was a transformational event {{in the field of}} regenerative medicine. The {{development of}} this technique also impacted ophthalmology, as patient-specific induced pluripotent stemcells (iPSCs) may be useful resources for some ophthalmological diseases. The lens is a key refractive element in the eye that focuses images of the visual world onto the retina. To establish a new model for drug screening to <b>treat</b> <b>lens</b> diseases and investigating lens aging and development, we examined whether human lens epithelial cells (HLECs) could be induced into iPSCs and if lensspecific differentiation of these cells could be achieved under defined chemical conditions. We first efficiently reprogrammed HLECs from age-related cataract patients to iPSCs with OCT- 4, SOX- 2, and KLF- 4. The resulting HLECderived iPS (HLE-iPS) colonies were indistinguishable from human ES cells with respect to morphology, gene expression, pluripotent marker expression and their ability to generate all embryonic germ-cell layers. Next, we performed a 3 -step induction procedure: HLE-iPS cells were differentiated into large numbers of lens progenitor-like cells with defined factors (Noggin, BMP and FGF 2), and we determined that these cells expressed lens-specific markers (PAX 6, SOX 2, SIX 3, CRYAB, CRYAA, BFSP 1, and MIP).

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether digital spatial intensity patterns {{can be developed}} to effect precise in vitro correction of myopic, hyperopic, and astigmatic refractive errors in a silicone light-adjustable lens (LAL). Also, to {{determine whether}} a new spatial intensity pattern for “lock-in ” is effective in vitro. Methods: A digital interferometer/irradiation system was developed to irradiate LALs and measure the power change following irradiation. Light-adjustable lenses were mounted into a wet cell maintained at 35. 0 ± 0. 5 °C (simulated ocular temperature) and allowed to equilibrate for a minimum of 2 hours. Ultraviolet light was then applied with spatial light intensity patterns to correct hyperopia, myopia, and astigmatism. Light-adjustable <b>lenses</b> were also <b>treated</b> to effect lock-in with a separate spatial light intensity pattern. <b>Treated</b> <b>lenses</b> were characterized for power change and optical quality. In the case of lock-in, exhaustive chemical extraction was also performed to determine the percentage of remaining macromer. Results: Appropriate digital irradiation spatial intensity patterns were created to develop nomograms for in vitro correction of myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism in approximate 0. 25 D steps. Power changes were reproducible and did not alter optical quality of the LALs. Further, lock-in dosing of the LALs did not alter optical quality or significantly change LAL power. Conclusions: In vitro nomograms have been developed for a silicone LAL that permit precise correction of myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism.

In the second part, an in-vivo TGF-β transgenic and Smad 3 knockout model was used to examine the role of Smad 3 signaling pathway in TGF-β-induced ASC development. Lastly, an in-vitro rat lens epithelial explant culture model was used to investigate the potential role of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Optical, morphological and molecular changes were analyzed in theses studies. Results from cultured rat lenses show a significant increase of back vertex distance variability (decrease of sharpness and focus) during ASC development. Inhibition of MMPs eliminated the TGF-β-induced plaque formation. Similarly, the overexpression of TGF-β 1 in transgenic mouse lenses leads to ASC formation and a decrease in lens optical quality in comparison to wild-type lenses, while TGF-β 1 /Smad 3 -/- (null) lenses show diminished TGF-β-induced effects. The plaques formed in the TGF-β 1 /Smad 3 -/- lenses are substantially smaller than in the TGF-β 1 /Smad 3 +/+ lenses.

(2) Electromagnetic radiation exposure group treated with 1. 1 GHz, 2. 22 mW microwave radiation for 90 cycles of 50 minutes irradiation followed by 10 minutes pause and cultured up to 10 days. (3) Electromagnetic radiation exposure group treated as group 2 with 192 cycles of radiation and cultured for 15 days. (4) Lenses exposed to 39. 5 ºC for 2 hours 3 times with 24 hours interval after each treatment beginning on the second day of the culture and cultured for 11 days. During the culture period, lens optical quality was followed daily by a computer-operated scanning laser beam. At the end of the culture period, control and <b>treated</b> <b>lenses</b> were analyzed morphologically and by assessment of the lens epithelial ATPase activity. Exposure to 1. 1 GHz, 2. 22 mW microwaves caused a reversible decrease in lens optical quality accompanied by irreversible morphological and biochemical damage to the lens epithelial cell layer. The effect of the electromagnetic radiation on the lens epithelium was remarkably different from those of conductive heat. The results of this investigation showed that electromagnetic fields from microwave radiation have a negative impact on the eye lens. The lens damage by electromagnetic fields was distinctly different from that caused by conductive heat...|$|R
40|$|We have {{assessed}} {{the role of}} bandage contact lenses in the primary treatment of traumatic corneal abrasions. Patients <b>treated</b> with bandage <b>lenses</b> healed more quickly (0. 05 greater than p greater than 0. 02) and with less discomfort (0. 05 greater than p greater than 0. 02) than those treated traditionally, with the added advantage of maintaining vision during treatment. Resterilisation of contact lenses reduces the cost and makes the treatment economically viable. Large diameter lenses were fitted satisfactorily {{without the use of}} keratometry...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The polyherbal eye drop (Itone™) is {{a mixture}} of aqueous {{distillates}} of nineteen traditionally used ingredients that sum up to impart potency to the formulation and make it a useful adjunct in various ocular pathologies. However, as there have been no controlled experimental studies accounting to the above claim, therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the polyherbal formulation (PHF) for antiangiogenic, anti-inflammatory, anticataract, antioxidant and cytotoxicity in addition to the evaluation of intraocular penetration of PHF in rabbit eyes using LC-MS/MS. Materials and methods Antiangiogenic activity of the PHF was evaluated using in ovo chick chorio-allantoic membrane (CAM) assay and in vivo cautery induced corneal neovascularization assay in rats. Anticataract potential was evaluated using steroid induced cataract in developing chick embryos, sodium selenite induced cataract in rat pups and galactose induced cataract in rats. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using di-phenyl picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated in vitro using inhibition of LTB 4 formation in human WBCs and in vivo using carrageenan induced paw edema assay in rats. The cytotoxicity was evaluated against HeLa cancer cell lines using (3 -(4, 5 -Dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Furthermore evaluation of the intraocular penetration of the PHF was carried out in rabbit eyes via aqueous humor paracentesis and further analysis using LC-MS/MS. Results PHF significantly inhibited VEGF induced proliferation of new blood vessels in CAM assay and inhibited the cautery induced corneal neovascularization in rats. Additionally, PHF showed noticeable delay in the progression of cataract in the selenite and galactose induced cataract models whereby the PHF <b>treated</b> <b>lenses</b> were graded for stages II and III respectively. However, the PHF did not show any anticataract activity in the hydrocortisone induced cataract model. Moreover, PHF exhibited anti-inflammatory activity whereby it showed 39. 34 % inhibition of LTB 4 formation and significantly inhibited carrageenan induced paw edema in rats. Eight compounds of PHF viz. camphor, casticin, curcumin-II, quercetin, rosmarinic acid, γ-terpinene, β-pinene and dipentene exhibited transcorneal penetration in rabbit eyes. Conclusion The significant antiangiogenic and anti-inflammatory activities evinced by the PHF merits further investigation for ocular neovascular and inflammatory diseases in humans. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To compare {{effectiveness}} of cleaning {{with and without}} rubbing of soft contact lenses. Methods: Three-hundred new biweekly disposable hydrogel lenses (Ocufilcon D, FDA Group IV; 55 % water content) were artificially deposited with serum albumin, hand cream (semi-transparent deposits) and mascara (black deposits). The <b>treated</b> <b>lenses</b> were randomly divided into three groups, each group cleaned by one of three methods of cleaning - Rubbing (R), No-Rub following the manufacturer's instruction on duration of rinsing (NR 1) and No-Rub with a shorter duration of rinsing (NR 2). Four commercially-available multipurpose solutions (MPS) and a saline were used. The cleaning effectiveness {{was determined by the}} amount of deposits remaining on the contact lenses after cleaning, assessed {{with the aid of a}} slit-lamp. The level of deposits remaining (in terms of coverage of lens surface) were determined using a five-point scale [0 (no observable deposits) - 4 (> 80 % deposits remained) ] for semi-transparent deposits (protein and hand cream) and black deposits (mascara). The investigators were masked as to the solutions used (except for one MPS which has a different rinsing time than the other MPS), and the investigator who assessed the deposits left on the lenses did not know which solution or cleaning method was used to clean each lens. Results: Lenses cleaned by the R method were significantly cleaner than those cleaned by methods NR 1 and NR 2. No significant difference was found between lenses cleaned by NR 1 and NR 2 methods. The median grade of deposits for lenses cleaned by R method was 0. 5 for both semi-transparent and black deposits. For lenses cleaned by NR 1 and NR 2 methods, the median grade of deposits left on lens surfaces was 4. 0 for both types of deposits. Different solutions used did not affect the level of deposits left on lens surfaces for all three cleaning methods. Conclusions: Not rubbing the soft lens when cleaning is ineffective in removing loosely-bound deposits. A longer rinse, as recommended by the manufacturers, does not remove significantly more deposits than a shorter rinse with the MPS. This work supports the view that contact lens wearers should be encouraged to rub their lenses when cleaning. School of Optometr...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{determine}} {{the reason for}} the high level of attachment of Acanthamebic to silicone hydrogel (SH) contact lenses. The effect surface treatment has on attachment is determined using silicone elastomer (SE) lenses. Methods. All test lenses were unworn. SH (PureVision), conventional hydrogel (Acuvue), treated SE (Silsoft), and untreated SE (Silsoft) lens quarters were incubated for 90 min with plate-cultured Acanthamoeba castellanii trophozoites. After incubation and rinsing, the trophozoites attached to one surface of each quarter were counted by direct light microscopy. Sixteen replicates were performed for each lens type. Logarithmic transformation of data allowed the use of parametric analysis of variance. Results. Lens polymer had a significant effect on attachment (P < 0. 001), with higher numbers of trophozoites attaching to the SH and SE (<b>treated</b> and untreated) <b>lenses</b> as compared with the conventional hydrogel. No significant difference in attachment was detected between the SH and SE (<b>treated</b> and untreated) <b>lenses.</b> Conclusion. Acanthamoeba attachment to the SH lens was significantly greater than to the conventional hydrogel. The similarity in attachment to surface-treated and non-surface-treated SE lenses suggests that the increased attachment found with the SH lens may be an inherent characteristic of the polymer rather than an effect of the surface treatment procedure. It is possible that SH lenses are at greater risk of promoting Acanthamoeba infection if exposed to the organism because of the enhanced attachment characteristic of this new material...|$|R

Therefore, this study reports the case of a 15 -year-old boy presenting with posttraumatic loss of vision in the right eye due to posterior capsular rupture and herniation of lens material into the vitreous cavity, which was detected by B-scan ultrasonography and {{magnetic resonance imaging}} as no ophthalmic examination was possible due to the posttraumatic cataract. The patient was <b>treated</b> by <b>lens</b> aspiration with anterior chamber vitrectomy and placement of posterior chamber intraocular lens, with the patient achieving 6 / 6 visual acuity postoperatively. This case is unusual due to the rarity of the findings, and it highlights the crucial role of imaging in achieving timely diagnosis and surgery to restore vision in the affected eye.

40|$|AIM: To {{retrospectively}} {{evaluate the}} effect of lens extraction combined with vitrectomy to <b>treat</b> traumatic <b>lens</b> dislocation with secondary glaucoma. METHODS:Thirty-one eyes(31 cases) of lens dislocation caused by blunt trauma with secondary glaucoma were treated respectively with cataract extraction combined with anterior vitrectomy, trabeculectomy and intraocular lens implantation. The visual acuity and pressure were observed 1 wk, 1 and 3 mo after operative. RESULTS:Thirty-one eyes were all complete the operation successfully, and 6 eyes were given combined trabeculectomy, 9 eyes were implanted anterior chamber intraocular lens implantation(IOL) and 15 eyes were given posterior chamber suture fixation. Sixteen eyes were implanted in one-stage operation, while 8 eyes were implanted in two-stage operation. All intraocular pressure(IOP) were controlled to the normal level after operation and 23 eyes had visual acuity of more than 0. 3. CONCLUSION:Lens extraction combined with vitrectomy is an effective method for treatment of lens dislocation with secondary glaucoma. In order to control the IOP and get well visual function, we should choose IOL implantation or trabeculectomy according to the patient's condition...|$|R
