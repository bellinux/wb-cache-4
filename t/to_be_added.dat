5|$|Director Rob Bowman {{initially}} {{thought that}} the episode could be filmed in five days, two fewer than usual. However, it was actually filmed in three days after pressure from Paramount with two spent only on the sickbay set.

Stillwell was responsible for selecting the clips {{that went into the}} episode, with 21 different clips included.

5|$|During {{the coming}} decades, however, the {{suitability}} of the tower {{for the work of}} the department came into question. The condition of the roof remained problematic, and steel girders had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>added</b> to support the main timbers. Increasing traffic levels around the tower led to subsidence and high levels of vibration, effecting the operation of the delicate instruments, and worsened after the opening of Lambeth Bridge in 1932. Some of the department's work was transferred to their Bushy House facility in Teddington in the 1920s, and in 1938 the department relinquished the tower altogether.|$|E

This made The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour the highest-grossing female and solo tour of 2013, and one of the highest-grossing tours of the decade. Performances of numerous songs from the tour were broadcast and behind-the-scenes footage was released.|$|E
