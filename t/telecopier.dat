5000|$|The {{most famous}} hotline between {{states is the}} Moscow-Washington hotline, which {{is also known as}} the [...] "red telephone", {{although}} telephones have never been used in this capacity. This direct communications link was established on 20 June 1963, {{in the wake of the}} Cuban Missile Crisis, and utilized teletypewriter technology, later replaced by <b>telecopier</b> and then by electronic mail.|$|E
50|$|Fax (short for facsimile), {{sometimes}} called telecopying or telefax (the latter short for telefacsimile), is the telephonic transmission of scanned printed material (both text and images), normally to a telephone number {{connected to a}} printer or other output device. The original document is scanned with a fax machine (or a <b>telecopier),</b> which processes the contents (text or images) as a single fixed graphic image, converting it into a bitmap, and then transmitting it through the telephone system {{in the form of}} audio-frequency tones. The receiving fax machine interprets the tones and reconstructs the image, printing a paper copy. Early systems used direct conversions of image darkness to audio tone in a continuous or analog manner. Since the 1980s, most machines modulate the transmitted audio frequencies using a digital representation of the page which is compressed to quickly transmit areas which are all-white or all-black.|$|E
50|$|Modern <b>telecopiers</b> and photocopiers use {{the same}} principle, with this close the sensor of light {{intensity}} {{was replaced by a}} sensor CCC, and that the device of impression is based on the laser technology, and either photographic.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, a small lab {{team was}} {{borrowing}} 914 copiers and modifying them. The lab was developing {{what it called}} long distance xerography (LDX) to connect two copiers using the public telephone network, so that a document scanned on one machine would print out on the other. The LDX system was introduced in 1964. Many years later this work came to fruition in the Xerox <b>telecopiers,</b> seminal to today's fax machines. The fax operation in today's multifunction copiers is true to Carlson's original vision for these devices.|$|R
50|$|Later, {{during the}} early 1990s, the {{widespread}} adoption of <b>telecopiers</b> {{made it possible to}} duplicate these materials remotely. The use of a fax machine to duplicate these materials also changed the emphases of their subjects; various alarms and urban legends were propagated to distant readers over the telephone lines. This use of fax has been somewhat supplanted by email as that technology became more widely used and embedded in the culture; the sort of urban legends that once circulated by fax are now likely to appear as email hoaxes. Specific computer related alarms are the subject of virus hoaxes; email makes forwarding of texts relatively easy, and the frightening nature of the revelation makes it seem important to pass along, despite any doubts the sender might have.|$|R
40|$|The {{connection}} {{consisted of}} {{an exchange of}} information between the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design and Iain Baxter's N. E. Thing Co. Ltd., via telex, <b>telecopier</b> and telephone. The N. E. Thing Co. initiated propositions and the college community responded with some appropriate activity. The transmissions from the exhibition are arranged chronologically, with evidence of response following each. " p. [2...|$|E
40|$|Three maKes of telefacsimile {{equipment}} are descnbed and compared (1) Xerox Magnavox <b>Telecopier,</b> (2) Datafax 1824 and Dial/Datafax, and (3) Alden II Docufax. The models described {{are thought to}} be potentially useful to libraries. specifically for the purpose of transferring copies of pnnted pages from one library to another. Each system is capable of operating at minimum cost by using a single voice-grade telephone line. In this report the operating principles and characteristics of each model are described and the reliability and copy quality assessed. Costs are compared and tabulated for equipment, supplies. and telephone line service in two _hypothetical library systems, one comprising two libraries and the other, ten libraries. It is concluded that all three of these makes of equipment perform with sufficient rehability and copy quality for most library purposes. The type of equipment to select for a specific library apphcation is determined primarily by the anticipated volume of use, the quality and capacity of telephone lines to be used, {{and the nature of the}} material to b...|$|E
50|$|In 1964, Xerox Corporation {{introduced}} (and patented) {{what many}} {{consider to be}} the first commercialized version of the modern fax machine, under the name (LDX) or Long Distance Xerography. This model was superseded two years later with a unit that would truly set the standard for fax machines for years to come. Up until this point facsimile machines were very expensive and hard to operate. In 1966, Xerox released the Magnafax <b>Telecopiers,</b> a smaller, 46-pound facsimile machine. This unit was far easier to operate and could be connected to any standard telephone line. This machine was capable of transmitting a letter-sized document in about six minutes. The first sub-minute, digital fax machine was developed by Dacom, which built on digital data compression technology originally developed at Lockheed for satellite communication.|$|R
