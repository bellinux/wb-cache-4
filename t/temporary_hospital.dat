5|$|A {{few weeks}} after Allison, FEMA opened six {{disaster}} recovery centers across southeast Texas, which provided recovery information to those who applied for disaster assistance. The American Red Cross and the Salvation Army opened 48shelters {{at the peak of}} need for people driven from their homes, which served nearly 300,000meals. After the extensive damage to Houston hospitals, the U. S. Public Health Service team set up a <b>temporary</b> <b>hospital</b> at the Houston Police Academy. The team of 87medical personnel served over 1,000patients within two weeks of Allison's passage. Similarly, the National Disaster Medical System deployed a <b>temporary</b> <b>hospital</b> to Houston with 88 professionals, aiding nearly 500 people. Debris removal, which was initially slow, was aided by FEMA to expedite the removal process. FEMA provided 75% of the federal cost of the removal. Thirty-five volunteer services provided aid for the flood victims in Texas, including food, clothing, and volunteers to help repair the houses.|$|E

However, the epidemic struck the city soon after; Betances' stepmother and one of his brothers-in-law would die from it. By October 1856 Betances would {{have to take care of}} the entire operation on his own temporarily.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II, which started with the invasion of Poland by Germany, Kolbe {{was one of the}} few brothers who remained in the monastery, where he organized a <b>temporary</b> <b>hospital.</b> After the town was captured by the Germans, he was briefly arrested by them on 19 September 1939 but released on 8 December. He refused to sign the Deutsche Volksliste, which would have given him rights similar to those of German citizens in exchange for recognizing his German ancestry. Upon his release he continued work at his monastery, where he and other monks provided shelter to refugees from Greater Poland, including 2,000 Jews whom he hid from German persecution in their friary in Niepokalanów. Kolbe also received permission to continue publishing religious works, though significantly reduced in scope. The monastery thus continued to act as a publishing house, issuing a number of anti-Nazi German publications. On 17 February 1941, the monastery was shut down by the German authorities. That day Kolbe and four others were arrested by the German Gestapo and imprisoned in the Pawiak prison. On 28 May, he was transferred to Auschwitz as prisoner #16670.|$|E
