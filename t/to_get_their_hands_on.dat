In November 2010, FilmDistrict acquired North American distribution rights. The owners were so eager <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> Drive, they started negotiating to buy it before seeing any footage, believing it could appeal to people who enjoy a genre movie, {{as well as the}} arthouse crowd. The film had a release date of September 16, 2011, in the United States.|$|E

That's something I'll continue to talk about in the weeks ahead.|$|E
25|$|Under Edward VI, John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, {{sponsored}} an act allowing Newcastle to annexe Gateshead as its suburb. The {{main reason}} for this was to allow the Newcastle Hostmen, who controlled the export of Tyne coal, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the Gateshead coal mines, previously controlled by the Bishop of Durham. However, when Mary I came to power, Dudley met his downfall and the decision was reversed. The Reformation allowed private access to coal mines previously owned by Tynemouth and Durham priories {{and as a result}} coal exports increase dramatically, from 15,000 tons in 1500 to 35,000 tons in 1565, and to 400,000 tons in 1625.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the number}} of Pomo basket weavers has decreased, their skill and artistic vision is still intact, and people pay a pretty penny <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the art. Today, new Pomo baskets might sell {{for as much as}} $1,000, and the more {{historical}} ones might sell for more than $10,000. Dealing of these baskets has not always been so lucrative and many have tried to exploit the artists and communities. Dealers and collectors may have exploited the lucrative basket market, but it still paid well enough to provide income to Pomo women where hunting and gathering were no longer feasible and money was needed for survival.|$|E
25|$|Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception {{was first}} officially {{released}} in North America on November 1, 2011, then November 2 in Europe and Japan, and November 3 in Australia.

On October 22, reports started coming out that a few gamers in Europe and other regions had managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> retail copies of Uncharted 3, all thanks to retailers breaking the street release date. Minutes later after confirming that retail copies of Uncharted 3 had been leaked early, more images surfaced on the internet to prove the leak claim. The pictures arrived showing Uncharted 3s title screen. However, the release date was pushed forward to October 28, 2011, in parts of Europe last-minute.|$|E
25|$|Season three (2001–2002) sees Angel {{struggle}} with fatherhood when Darla returns pregnant with his child, {{despite the fact}} that vampires supposedly are unable to conceive. When Darla kills herself to give birth, Angel is left to raise the baby Connor (played by triplets Connor, Jake and Trenton Tupen) and protect him from those who wish <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> a child of two vampires. False prophecies, time travel, and betrayal lead to Angel losing his infant son to an old enemy, Holtz (Keith Szarabajka), who abducts Connor into a hell dimension where time passes differently. Connor (Vincent Kartheiser) returns days later, fully grown and under the belief that Angel is a soulless monster. Holtz kills himself and Angel is framed for his death by Holtz's lover, prompting Connor to take revenge by sinking his father {{to the bottom of the}} ocean. Over the course of this season, Angel's friendship with his colleague Cordelia evolves into romance, but circumstances prevent him from confessing his feelings.|$|E

500|$|Observers, {{including}} series director David Petrarca and Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes, {{said that}} illegal downloads did not hurt the series' prospects; it benefited from [...] "buzz" [...] and social commentary, {{and the high}} piracy rate did not significantly translate to lost subscriptions. According to Polygon, HBO's relaxed attitude towards piracy and the sharing of login credentials amounted to a premium-television [...] "free-to-play" [...] model. At a 2015 Oxford Union debate, series co-creator David Benioff {{said that he was}} just glad that people watched the show; illegally downloaded copies of the show sometimes interested viewers enough to buy a copy of the show, especially in countries where the show was not televised. Co-creator D. B. Weiss had mixed feelings, saying that the show was expensive to produce and [...] "if it doesn't make the money back, then it ceases to exist". However, he was pleased that so many people [...] "enjoy the show so much they can't wait <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> it."

2500|$|During the Great Depression, 20-month-old Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr., son {{of famous}} aviator Charles Lindbergh, was {{abducted}} {{from his home}} near Hopewell, New Jersey. A long investigation ensued as detectives attempted to round up the kidnapper of the baby. The police proceeded to seal off many roads {{in order to prevent}} the kidnapper's escape, and interrogated the members of the Lindbergh household. The stress of being under police questioning led to the suicide of Violet Sharpe. Dr. John F. Condon became a negotiator between the kidnapper [...] "John" [...] and the Lindbergh family. The kidnapper demanded a ransom of $50,000, which was paid but {{turned out to be a}} hoax. Two other hoaxes were perpetrated by two other people who were not involved in the kidnapping, desperate <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> ransom money. Both were charged after their declarations proved false. The baby was later found dead.|$|E
2500|$|Another wartime {{personality}} of Valenciennes was Louise de Bettignies (born in Saint-Amand-les-Eaux), a pupil of the Ursulines in Valenciennes from 1890 to 1896. Fluent in four languages (including German), in 1915 she created {{and directed the}} main British intelligence network behind enemy lines, nearly [...] from the front around Lille. Arrested {{at the end of}} September 1915, and imprisoned in Germany, she died of mistreatment in September 1918 two months before the Armistice. It is estimated that she saved the lives of nearly a thousand British soldiers by the remarkably precise information she obtained. For example, it enabled the British to conduct the first aerial bombing of a train (that of Kaiser Wilhelm II, who came to visit the front at Lille), though both aircraft were not equipped with suitable viewfinders and so the raid narrowly missed its target. The German High Command, based in Brussels, then put all its efforts into neutralising the accursed network that allowed the British to see everything and know everything about this part of the front. Louise's arrest was associated with the escape of Szeck Alexandre, a young Austrian radio operator got out of Brussels in August 1915, allowing the British <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the secret German diplomatic code. This code was exploited by Secret Service Room 40 ("Room 40"), under the supervision of Sir Reginald Hall, and in January 1917 allowed the decipherment of the famous Zimmermann Telegram, which triggered the United States' entry into the war in April 1917.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{practices}} employed by Special Circumstances {{would be considered}} distasteful even {{in the context of}} a Western democracy. Examples are the use of mercenaries to perform the work that the Culture does not want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>their</b> <b>hands</b> dirty with, and even outright threats of invasion (the Culture has issued ultimatums to other civilizations before). Some commentators have also argued that those SC agents tasked with civilising foreign cultures (and thus potentially also changing them into a blander, more Culture-like state) are also those most likely to regret these changes, with parallels drawn to real-world special forces trained to operate within the cultural mindsets of foreign nations.|$|R
