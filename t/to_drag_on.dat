Nevertheless, he resolved to attack at once, believing {{that if he}} waited for Stevenson, the Marathas would {{have the chance to}} slip away and force the pursuit <b>to</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on.</b> Wellesley was also eager to forge a reputation for himself, and despite his numerical disadvantage, he was confident that the Maratha’s irregular forces would be swept aside by his disciplined troops, and only Scindia’s regular infantry could be expected to stand and fight.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Crono, Marle, and Lucca attend a {{political}} {{meeting between the}} Kingdom of Guardia and Porre. An assassin attacks; the party pursues him to the Denadoro Mts., where Lucca's prototype Time Egg backfires and sends them to the future. They find Belthasar there, who has established a research facility called Chronopolis. He warns of a new threat to the timeline, and sends the party to the Ocean Palace ruins of 11,995B.C. to investigate. They find Magus, still searching for Schala and feuding with Dalton. They confront a mysterious villain who resurrects Schala and robs the early Masamune, still embedded in the husk of the Mammon Machine. Its theft changes history, causing the Mystics' war in the Middle Ages <b>to</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> another 50years, led by the illusionist Kasmir. The party retrieve Frog (named Glenn in Crimson Echoes) from 605A.D. and meet with Belthasar.|$|E

5|$|The {{third factor}} {{which led to}} the quick {{disintegration}} of II Corps was the poor state of morale amongst the soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. By 1975, the morale of South Vietnamese soldiers and their commanding officers had reached its lowest point as the war continued <b>to</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> with no end in sight. The determination of the ARVN officer corps had taken a serious blow when South Vietnamese Foreign Minister Tran Van Lam returned from the United States in February 1975, and reported that no additional military or economic aid had been offered. When the order was given to abandon the Central Highlands, the primary concern of South Vietnamese military personnel was not battlefield victories, but the welfare of their families. Consequently, when the North Vietnamese attacked South Vietnamese forces on Route 7, large numbers of South Vietnamese soldiers left the battlefield to search for their families amidst the chaos. During the final days of South Vietnam’s existence, the average South Vietnamese soldier showed more loyalty to his family than to his commanding officer, which {{had a significant impact on}} his willingness to fight on.|$|E
25|$|The {{siege of}} Kumher was prosecuted with great vigour but the garrison, {{in hopes of}} the Emperor's arrival, put up a stiff resistance. Mirza Najaf Khan grew {{impatient}} as the siege seemed <b>to</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> an interminable length of time. The Amir-ul-umra, out of the considerations of policy and for the general good, sent a letter full of admonitions... reminding Ranjit Singh that there was yet time to secure pardon through submission, and to atone for his past error by loyal service, without dragging several thousand men to their destruction.|$|E
25|$|There was no {{distinction}} between civil and criminal offences. Sometimes civil disputes were allowed <b>to</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> until time offered the solution. Crimes such as theft, adultery and forgery were considered serious offences. In most cases the punishment was {{in the order of}} the offender having to maintain a perpetual lamp at a temple. Even murder was punished with a fine. In one instance a man had stabbed an army commander. Rajendra Chola II ordered the culprit to endow 96 sheep for a lamp at a neighbouring temple.|$|E

He also described the Senate as running on [...] "Sisitsky-time". Due to Sisitsky's frequent rants and attacks on Bulger, the Senate <b>to</b> <b>dragged</b> <b>on</b> while Sisitsky spoke and feverishly rushed to pass legislation when Sisitsky's was tired out or when he was away teaching at Puget Sound Law School.|$|R

500|$|Wilson sent Marshall {{around the}} nation to deliver morale-boosting speeches and {{encourage}} Americans to buy Liberty Bonds {{in support of the}} war effort. [...] Marshall was well suited for the job, as he had been earning extra money as a public speaker while vice president, and gladly accepted the responsibility. In his speeches, he cast the war as a [...] "moral crusade to preserve the dignity of the state for the rights of individuals". [...] In his memoir, he recalled that the war seemed <b>to</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> [...] "with leaden feet", and that he was relieved when it finally ended. As the war neared its end, Marshall became the first vice president to conduct cabinet meetings; Wilson left him with this responsibility while traveling in Europe to sign the Versailles treaty and to work on gathering support for his League of Nations idea. Wilson became the first president to personally deliver a treaty to be ratified by the Senate, which he presented to Marshall as the presiding officer during a morning session.|$|E
500|$|The opening {{number of}} the {{black-and-white}} [...] "special", [...] "Let It Snow" [...] featuring Blaine and Kurt, garnered the most praise. Slezak gave it an [...] "A" [...] and {{described it as a}} [...] "jazzy, uptempo take on the seasonal classic with gorgeous harmonies and retro dancing", and said it rivaled their Christmas duet from 2010, [...] "Baby, It's Cold Outside". While Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger enjoyed the number, she preferred the previous year's offering; Flandez called [...] "Let It Snow" [...] an [...] "admirable job". Futterman characterized it as [...] "both effortless and full of seasonal spirit", and Votta said it was [...] "a spot-on tribute to male duets of yesteryear with that knowing undercurrent of romance even when it's not explicit". Chaney gave it an [...] "A", but she wondered at the inclusion of the next song, [...] "My Favorite Things", since it [...] "technically isn't a holiday song". The number was also not as well received as many of the others: Bell described it as taking [...] "a turn for the worse", Hyman noted that it [...] "didn't do too much for me", and Kubicek said it [...] "seemed <b>to</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> and on and on with no real purpose". However, West called it a [...] "wonderful effort" [...] and Slezak wrote that [...] "a little Rodgers and Hammerstein is always welcome at any party"; both reviewers gave the performance a [...] "B+".|$|E
500|$|On {{his way to}} Italy, Servetus {{stopped in}} Geneva to visit [...] "d'Espeville", where he was {{recognized}} and arrested. Calvin's secretary, Nicholas de la Fontaine, composed a list of accusations that was submitted before the court. The prosecutor was Philibert Berthelier, {{a member of a}} libertine family and son of a famous Geneva patriot, and the sessions were led by Pierre Tissot, Perrin's brother-in-law. The libertines allowed the trial <b>to</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> in an attempt to harass Calvin. The difficulty in using Servetus as a weapon against Calvin was that the heretical reputation of Servetus was widespread and most of the cities in Europe were observing and awaiting the outcome of the trial. This posed a dilemma for the libertines, so on 21 August the council decided to write to other Swiss cities for their opinions, thus mitigating their own responsibility for the final decision. While waiting for the responses, the council also asked Servetus if he preferred to be judged in Vienne or in Geneva. He begged to stay in Geneva. On 20 October the replies from Zurich, Basel, Bern, and Schaffhausen were read and the council condemned Servetus as a heretic. The following day he was sentenced to burning at the stake, the same sentence as in Vienne. Some scholars claim that Calvin and other ministers asked that he be beheaded instead of burnt, knowing that burning at the stake was the only legal recourse. This plea was refused and on 27 October, Servetus was burnt alive at the Plateau of Champel at the edge of Geneva.|$|E

[...] Mike Schiller from PopMatters gave the album five out of ten stars. While he called the album derivative and [...] "unabashedly mainstream" [...] he also said [...] "For all of its awkward leanings, the melodies are catchy, and the beats are crisp and tight, popping out of the speakers and driving everything forward with authority." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{parallel}} universe {{featured in the}} Sliders Season Five episode [...] "The Return of Maggie Beckett", the German Wehrmacht broke through the Allied lines at the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, which caused World War II <b>to</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> until 1947. General Eisenhower was relieved as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe {{and returned to the}} United States in disgrace. Consequently, Stevenson became President. The Stevenson administration made the Roswell UFO incident in July 1947 public knowledge and signed the Reticulan-American Free Trade Agreement (RAFTA), giving the US access to advanced Reticulan technology. This leads to a manned mission to Mars in the 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|The key {{to whether}} the Kut {{garrison}} {{would be able to}} hold out was food. After early attempts to storm the town failed, the Ottoman forces investing Kut opted to starve the defenders into submission. Townshend had ordered some of his forces to break out and regroup downriver where the remnants of I.E.F. [...] "D" [...] were beginning to gather. However, even by decreasing the number of mouths to feed, the food problem was more complex than simply the amount available. As the siege began <b>to</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on,</b> Townshend sent word to Nixon that his food supply would only last until 15 January 1916.|$|E

2500|$|On 2 August 2016, Adams {{formally}} {{announced that}} Callinan {{had found that}} Bain was not innocent [...] "on the balance of probabilities", {{and as a result}} the government would not be making an apology or compensating Bain for wrongfully spending 13 years in prison. Adams also said that Bain's legal team had indicated that they would have mounted a legal challenge against Callinan's report and that while the Crown was confident in the strength of its position no one benefited from the matter continuing <b>to</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on.</b> The Crown therefore agreed to make an ex gratia payment of $925,000 in recognition of the time and expenses incurred by Bain during the compensation process and the desirability of avoiding further litigation.|$|E
2500|$|Pernilla Oldmark, {{spokesperson}} for Tele2 in Stockholm, said the hoax {{had been carried}} out by the Latvian branch of Tele2 though authorised by its head office. She apologised for disruption and said the stunt had been intended to launch a forthcoming marketing campaign, claiming [...] "The message will become clear as soon as the concept is launched". Latvian Advertising Association President Girts Ozols said that the situation was unprecedented but the hoax could be considered an ethics violation in professional advertising. Ozols expressed concern that the incident had caused the community to feel insecure, and commented [...] "If such a prank is pulled, the culprits should not have allowed it <b>to</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> for so long without revealing the truth." [...] The Latvian Advertising Association's board is to review the matter.|$|E
2500|$|The {{report on}} cavalry tactics (8 November 1901) demanded an {{effective}} rifle for cavalry {{rather than the}} existing carbine, but only as a [...] "secondary" [...] weapon. [...] Roberts (10 November 1901) ordered cavalry {{to give up their}} steel weapons {{for the duration of the}} campaign, over the protests of French who argued that this was making the Boers tactically bolder. In early November 1901 French, who was by now reliant on methodical operations and excellent Field Intelligence, was infuriated by Kitchener’s attempt to micromanage operations. In March French had expected the war <b>to</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> until September 1902, but Kritzinger was captured in mid-November. French continued to lobby about cavalry tactics, agreeing (21 February 1902) with the Mounted Infantry expert Maj-Gen Edward Hutton that it was [...] "the bullet that kills" [...] but that the important matter was [...] "the moral power of cavalry".|$|E

50|$|When an {{aircraft}} {{is put into}} a side slip with no other changes to the throttle or elevator, the pilot will notice an increased rate of descent (or reduced rate of ascent).

2500|$|Harris' {{criticism}} of the gameplay include the [...] "frustrating control, chuggy animation, and levels that just go on far too long." [...] He felt the levels needed more variety, stating that [...] "the missions are dreadfully too long and feature very little change in gameplay regardless of the settings and craft to control." [...] Eduardo Zacarias of GameZone also said the game had poor controls and, like Harris, criticized [...] "the fact that the levels seem <b>to</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> forever". He felt there were [...] "a few things that do keep the game from being a simple shooter in outer space, {{such as the ability}} to zoom through the forests of Endor on a speeder bike," [...] but added that [...] "these are just minor distractions that just hide the fact that this game is just way too repetitive." [...] Zacarias enjoyed the amount of detail in background of locations such as the forests of Endor, but criticized the vehicle graphics for looking like bad imitations. Nintendo Power gave Flight of the Falcon a score of 2.3 out of 5, echoing Harris and Zacarias's {{criticism of}} the length of the levels. The magazine stated, however, that the game has [...] "an unmistakable Star Wars flair." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 12 March 1171, as {{the result}} of {{increasingly}} divergent interests between Byzantium and the Republic of Venice, and in an attempt to curtail the Venetians' growing economic presence in his realm, Manuel imprisoned all Venetians in the Empire and confiscated all of their property. Venice retaliated by outfitting a fleet of 120 ships under Doge Vitale II Michele. After attacking and capturing the Dalmatian cities under Byzantine control, the Venetians landed in the island of Euboea but were expelled by imperial troops, and then occupied the island of Chios to spend the winter. The Venetians sent envoys to negotiate, but [...] Manuel allowed them <b>to</b> <b>drag</b> <b>on</b> until his own counterstroke, 150 ships under Kontostephanos' command, was ready. In the meantime, the Venetians suffered of disease on Chios. In April 1172, Kontostephanos set sail, but the Venetians were forewarned by the astrologer Aaron Isaakios, one of Manuel's confidantes, and hastily abandoned Chios. Kontostephanos pursued them, but while the Venetians sailed north, raiding the islands of Thasos, Lesbos and Skyros, he assumed they would sail back westwards, and directed his fleet to Cape Malea. Learning of the Venetians' true whereabouts, he turned back north, but although he managed to capture or sink several stragglers, he was unable to bring the main Venetian fleet to battle. Doge Vitale II returned his fleet to Venice on 28 May, but the losses suffered and the failure to gain any concrete objective led to his lynching by the angry mob.|$|E
