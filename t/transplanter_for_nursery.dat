40|$|Transplanters {{have been}} {{developed}} for rice seedling planting into puddled soils to alleviate labour shortages and reduce costs of rice establishment (Adhikari et al., 2006). Although tillage for rice establishment is significantly mechanized in Bangladesh, 16 - 18 % of total production costs are due to tillage and land leveling (BRRI, 2013). Development of a rice <b>transplanter</b> suitable <b>for</b> unpuddled transplanting under minimum tillage conditions could further minimize the land preparation cost which will be of interest to small-holder farmers. No significant work to date has been conducted in Bangladesh to develop a rice <b>transplanter</b> <b>for</b> minimum tillage unpuddled soil conditions.

40|$|Manual {{transplanting}} is {{tedious and}} time consuming which often {{the causes of}} delayed planting resulting yield loss of rice in Bangladesh. Mechanized rice transplanting {{is seen as a}} solution of labor problems. Likewise, using mechanized rice transplanting ensures uniform plant spacing as well as fast and efficient planting that contributes to high productivity (Manjunatha et al., 2009). Transplanters have been developed for rice seedling planting into puddled soils to alleviate labour shortages and reduce costs of rice establishment (Adhikari et al., 2006).

50|$|The {{benefits}} from using plastic mulch {{come at a}} higher cost than planting in bare soil. These costs include equipment, the plastic film used as the mulch, <b>transplanters</b> designed <b>for</b> plastic beds, and additional labor during installation and removal of mulch films. Specialized Mulch Application equipment must be used to install plastic mulch beds into a field. These machines shape the soil and apply the plastic to the prepared soil. <b>Transplanters</b> designed <b>for</b> plastic mulch {{can be used to}} plant the desired crop. Hand transplanting is an option but this is rather inefficient. The removal of plastic mulch also contributes to a higher cost through additional labor and equipment needed. Specialized designed undercutting equipment can be used to remove the plastic from the field after harvest.|$|R
