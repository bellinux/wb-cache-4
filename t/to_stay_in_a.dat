5|$|Following the season, the Flames signed Regehr {{to another}} five-year {{contract}} extension worth {{a total of}} US$20-million. The deal {{was considered to be}} worth less than he could have gotten as an unrestricted free agent the following year, but he chose to take less <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> city his family enjoyed and on a team he felt was competitive. Regehr played all 82 games for the Flames in 2007–08 despite being hit in the face by the puck in a game, and suffering a deep bruise on his foot while blocking a shot that was initially feared to be a broken bone.|$|E
5|$|In August Belgrano again took {{command of}} the Army of the North, but with very limited people and resources. He was ordered to avoid trying to advance against the royalists in the north, and was <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{defensive}} state at Tucumán. With Güemes in Salta, his task was to prevent the Royalists from moving to the south. The Supreme Director Pueyrredón was supporting an alternative plan designed by José de San Martín: create the Army of the Andes at Cuyo and, after making the Crossing of the Andes, defeat the royalists in Chile, get control of the Chilean navy, and attack the royalist stronghold of Lima with it.|$|E
5|$|While {{the team}} was a success, Willis and Motley contended with their share of racism. They were taunted, stepped on and insulted on the field. Off-the-field {{incidents}} also occurred. In their first season in 1946, Willis and Motley did not travel to {{a game against the}} Miami Seahawks after they received threatening letters and Miami officials said they would invoke a Florida law that forbade black players from competing against whites. Another time, a hotel where {{the team was}} staying asked Willis and Motley to leave. Brown threatened to move the entire team, and the hotel's management backed down. Willis and Motley were forced <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> separate hotel for a 1949 AAFC all-star game in Houston, Texas.|$|E

5|$|The {{silvertip shark}} is caught by {{commercial}} and artisan fisheries across its range using longlines, gillnets, and trawls, both intentionally and as bycatch. The fins are highly valued for shark fin soup and are {{sold on the}} export market, along with the skin and cartilage. The meat is marketed locally, fresh or dried and salted, as are the jaws and teeth. Silvertip sharks {{are known to be}} taken by fisheries in Indonesia, Myanmar, and the Philippines, as well as by various Indian Ocean nations with coral reef fisheries; it is also an increasingly important catch of pelagic fisheries, where it is often finned at sea. This species is susceptible to overfishing, due to its slow reproductive rate and tendency <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> certain area. It {{is believed to have been}} extirpated by Indonesian artisan fishers at Scott Reef off northern Australia, and is likely becoming rare in many other parts of its range. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the silvertip shark as Vulnerable.|$|E

40|$|Despite a {{large number}} of studies {{conducted}} on voluntary turnover, new studies on why people decide <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> organization may be needed, since factors that compel employees <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> could differ from those that motivate them to quit. Consistently, researchers have turned the question from why do people leave to why do they stay. For example, Mitchell and his colleagues introduced a new construct, job embeddedness, to provide a new outlook to answer the question “why people stay”. Several researchers have subsequently contributed to the further investigation of this construct. However, they did not address the issue of how job embeddedness may influence individuals' intention <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> organization. As a result, several questions still remain unanswered. For example, how do different dimensions of job embeddedness affect individuals' intention <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> organization? Do they have the same relevance? Does their relevance change over time? We will try to answer some of these questions by presenting an explorative study we conducted on the factors affecting the intention <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> of the dancers of a ballet company that is the Italy's most famous ballet company and one of the European most renowned contemporary ones. Our investigation suggests that different types and dimensions of embeddedness do not affect employees' intention <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> the same way.

40|$|Moving Target Defense (MTD) {{can enhance}} the {{resilience}} of cyber systems against attacks. Although {{there have been many}} MTD techniques, there is no systematic understanding and quantitative characterization of the power of MTD. In this paper, we propose to use a cyber epidemic dynamics approach to characterize the power of MTD. We define and investigate two complementary measures that are applicable when the defender aims to deploy MTD to achieve a certain security goal. One measure emphasizes the maximum portion of time during which the system can afford <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> undesired configuration (or posture), without considering the cost of deploying MTD. The other measure emphasizes the minimum cost of deploying MTD, while accommodating that the system has <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> undesired configuration (or posture) for a given portion of time. Our analytic studies lead to algorithms for optimally deploying MTD. ...|$|R
