Guruh recalled that Chrisye would sleep anywhere during extended planning sessions, including under the piano.|$|E

50|$|Matsunaka is a burly 183 cm (6 ft), 97 kg power hitter who {{currently}} hits {{in either the}} 3-hole or the cleanup spot in the Hawks' lineup. It is often said that balls Matsunaka pulls {{are less likely to}} go foul because of his ability to stay inside the pitch, a testament to how adept he is in turning on inside pitches. He also strikes out very infrequently compared to other so-called power hitters. He struck out just 85 <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> hit 46 home runs (his career high) in 2005, 67 <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> hit 44 homers in 2004 and 77 <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> hit 36 homers in 2001, never whiffing more than 91 times in a single season.|$|R

5|$|Then 22-year old Jurgen Themen {{appeared}} at the Olympics for the first <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> participated in the 100meters dash in Beijing. He was the sole male Surinamese participant {{in track and field}} during the 2008 Olympics. Themen participated in the first heat during the August 14 qualification round, completing the event in 10.61seconds and ranking seventh of eight athletes.

5|$|After the {{surprise}} gains of the flamboyant Jelinčič {{in the first}} round, the campaigns of both candidates opted for more concrete political statements in public campaigning and debates. Peterle replaced {{the head of his}} campaign, and concentrated on questioning Türk's role in the 1991 secession from Yugoslavia. Peterle alleged that at the <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he,</b> as Prime Minister, struggled for Slovenia's independence, Türk continued to act as an official representative of Yugoslavia in international institutions. The campaign was backed by the Prime Minister Janša and the Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel who {{went so far as to}} confirm Peterle's claims on the Foreign Ministry's official website. Türk denied the allegations, pointing to his opinion piece in the International Herald Tribune advocating international recognition of Slovenia, and the fact that it was Rupel himself who in 1992 appointed Türk as the Ambassador to the UN and praised him for his service to the country. Peterle's new strategy appeared to backfire, and the polls before the runoff predicted that Türk would win between 63% and over 70% of the vote.|$|E

Kevin reminds his father of a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> let a homeless man get away with stealing a can of tomato soup to feed his hungry family, for whom he had felt sorry. Emotional and sympathetic, Joe agrees to let his son off the hook, and the two make amends.|$|E
5|$|Dannatt was {{appointed}} Chief of the General Staff (CGS) in August 2006, succeeding General Sir Mike Jackson. Dannatt faced controversy over his outspokenness, in particular his calls for improved pay and conditions for soldiers {{and for a}} drawdown of operations in Iraq {{in order to better}} man those in Afghanistan. He also set about trying to increase his public profile, worried that he was not recognisable enough at a <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had to defend the Army's reputation against alleged prisoner abuse in Iraq. He later assisted with the formation of Help for Heroes to fund a swimming pool at Headley Court and, later in his tenure, brokered an agreement with the British press that allowed Prince Harry to serve in Afghanistan.

In November 2007, he became manager of a Football League team for the first <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> took over at one of his former clubs, Gillingham, but he was unable to prevent the club's relegation from League One {{at the end of the}} 2007–08 season.

5|$|Levesque {{was born}} in Nashua, New Hampshire. He watched wrestling for the first <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was five, a match {{involving}} Chief Jay Strongbow.

Following his graduation from high school in 1987, Levesque continued to enter several bodybuilding competitions, and was crowned Mr. Teenage New Hampshire in 1988 at the age of 19. While working as a manager at Gold's Gym in Nashua, New Hampshire, Levesque was introduced to world champion powerlifter, Ted Arcidi, who at the time was employed with the WWE.

In early 1992, Levesque enrolled in Kowalski's wrestling school, where he began to train as a professional wrestler.|$|E

It was a close result for a Rhondda election; Heale lost by just over 3,000votes. The 1923 election was a different affair, with Watts Morgan defeating Conservative candidate Alfred John Orchard by nearly 13,000votes.|$|E
5|$|Queen of the South {{started the}} game as the livelier team, pushing forward early on; however, Brechin City had the first goal scoring {{opportunity}} of the final when Graham Gibson's long range shot was saved by Queen of the South goalkeeper Andy Goram.
