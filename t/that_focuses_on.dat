50|$|Deleuze’s {{cinematic}} taxonomy {{emerges from}} the philosophy of Henri Bergson in Matter and Memory (1896). Bergson’s thesis is that of an enmeshed human body {{in the world of}} matter where perceptions cause affections and where affections cause actions. Deleuze sees a correspondence between Bergson’s tripartite formulation and the cinematic medium. There are thus three types of cinematic movement-images: perception images (<b>that</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> what is seen), affection images (<b>that</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> expressions of feeling) and action images (<b>that</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the duration of action). These three images are associated, respectively, with long shots, close-ups and medium shots.|$|R

5|$|Classically, {{metabolism}} is {{studied by}} a reductionist approach <b>that</b> <b>focuses</b> <b>on</b> a single metabolic pathway. Particularly valuable {{is the use}} of radioactive tracers at the whole-organism, tissue and cellular levels, which define the paths from precursors to final products by identifying radioactively labelled intermediates and products. The enzymes that catalyze these chemical reactions can then be purified and their kinetics and responses to inhibitors investigated. A parallel approach is to identify the small molecules in a cell or tissue; the complete set of these molecules is called the metabolome. Overall, these studies give {{a good view of the}} structure and function of simple metabolic pathways, but are inadequate when applied to more complex systems such as the metabolism of a complete cell.|$|E
