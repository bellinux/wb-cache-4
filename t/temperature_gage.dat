This report describes the activities that have been initiated and/or completed on the Water Temperature Monitoring of the Klamath River Mainstem Project. As described in our original proposal, seven water temperature monitoring sites were established in the Klamath River mainstem from Link River Dam in Oregon to the mouth of the Klamath River near the Pacific Ocean. During preparation for water <b>temperature</b> <b>gage</b> deployment in spring of 1993, Pacific Power and Light (PP&L) and the California Department of Fish and Game offered to share water temperature data from Ryan temperature gages located at two of this projectâ€™s proposed locations (below Link River Dam and below Iron Gate Dam).

40|$|Invasive bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) {{and silver}} carp (H. molitrix), hereafter, bigheaded carp, pose {{a major threat}} to the Great Lakes {{ecosystem}} as they advance toward Lake Michigan via the Illinois River. However, a series of navigation dams may deter their upstream movement. Starved Rock Lock and Dam (SRLD) is the most downstream gated dam on the Illinois River, therefore presenting the first navigation challenge for upstream migrating bigheaded carp. Before 2015, five acoustic receivers near SRLD detected successful upstream passage of only two of 900 tagged bigheaded carp. I further investigated the permeability of SRLD to bigheaded carp migration as a function of <b>temperature,</b> <b>gage</b> height, and dam operation. In 2015, I added 12 receivers around SRLD and acoustically tagged an additional 118 bigheaded carp downstream of SRLD. I also investigated the timing of bigheaded carp arriving downstream of SRLD using a generalized linear model. The explanatory variables influencing bigheaded carp arrival were average water temperature, average tailwater elevation, and the change in average water temperature. During 2015 - 2016, acoustic receivers recorded a total of 11 upstream passage events through SRLD, with nine through the dam gates, one through the lock chamber, and one undetermined. Passage through the dam gates occurred most frequently at high water levels when the dam gates were completely out of the water. The probability of upstream migrating bigheaded carp approaching SRLD was positively correlated with rising temperature and high gage. No upstream migrants approached SRLD between mid-September and late March. Overall, dam gates were more susceptible to upstream passage than the lock chamber, and environmental factors accurately predicted the arrival of bigheaded carp at SRLD. Modifying gate use during times of bigheaded carp arrival will likely prevent upstream passage through SRLD and other lock and dam structures...|$|E

In this study, two experimental fin tips were designed {{and attached to}} the sounding rocket in place of two stabilizer fins in order to collect data throughout the rocketâ€™s hypersonic flight profile. The desire to research, study, and test experimental fin tips was driven by the Air Force Research Laboratoryâ€™s Future responsive Access to Space Technologies (FAST) program and their desire to include vertical stabilizers on the wing tips of reusable launch vehicles (RLVs). In this research study, finite element models of the experimental fin tips were developed and used to predict the flight data collected by the strain and <b>temperature</b> <b>gages</b> attached to the test specimen.

40|$|The {{variety of}} turbulent-laminar {{transition}} criteria in such environments as the launch vehicle injection {{points to the}} essential influence of spherical nose roughness, which is included {{in one form or}} another in the critical Reynolds numbers for a lot of explorers of blunt bodies. Some of researchers of the reentry bodies have founded the correlation functions between the momentum thickness Reynolds number and Max number as the transition criteria. In this article we have considered results of flight tests carried out using launch vehicles to define boundary layer regime on the payload fairing surface. The measurements were carried out using specially designed complex of gages consisted of calorimeters, surface <b>temperature</b> <b>gages,</b> and pressure gages. The turbulent-laminar transition was defined in accordance with the sharp change of calorimeter readings and flow separation pressure gages indication. The universal criterion of turbulent-laminar transition has been identified for blunted payload fairings i. e. Reynolds number Reek based on the boundary layer edge parameters in the sonic point of the payload fairing spherical nose and surface roughness height k, which gives the best correlation of all data of flight experiment conducted to define turbulent-laminar transition in boundary layer. The criterion allows defining time margins when boundary layer regime is turbulent at Reek= 20 Â± 14 existing on space head surfaces and at Reek= 6 Â± 5 the boundary layer regime is totally laminar. It was defined that under conditions when there are jointly high background disturbances of free stream flux at operation of main launch vehicle engines and influence of the surface roughness the critical value of Reynolds number is an order-diminished value as compared to the values obtained in wind tunnels and in free flight. It was found that with decreasing of roughness influence in growing boundary layer the flow disturbances evolution wide apart the payload fairing nose along the surface rocket stages is close to the turbulization mechanism at the smooth surfaces. The criterion of transition from transient to turbulent regime at the surface rocket is momentum thickness Reynolds number ReÎ¸ =Â  900 Â± 100. The criterion of transition absence and the laminar boundary layer regime on the steps surface is ReÎ¸ = 200 Â± 50. </p...|$|R

The focus was on advanced resistance strain <b>gages</b> with a <b>temperature</b> range from room temperature to 2000 F (1095 C) and on methods for reliably attaching these gages to the various materials anticipated for use in the NASP program.
