25|$|When {{we think}} of {{interactivity}} and its meaning, we assume {{that it is only}} prominent in the conversational dynamics of individuals who are face-to-face. This restriction of opinion does not allow us to see its existence in mediated communication forums. Interactivity is present in some programming work, such as video games. It's also viable in the operation of traditional media. In the mid 1990s, filmmakers started using inexpensive digital cameras to create films. It was also the time when moving image technology had developed, which was able to be viewed on computer desktops in full motion. This development of new media technology was a new method for artists to share their work and interact with the big world. Other settings of interactivity include radio and television talk shows, letters to the editor, listener participation in such programs, and computer and technological programming. Interactive new media has become a <b>true</b> <b>benefit</b> to every one because people can express their artwork in more than one way with the technology that we have today and {{there is no longer a}} limit to what we can do with our creativity.|$|E

60|$|The motion, {{according}} to the letter of it, was ill-framed; for the Convention {{might have been a}} very good one, and still have disappointed the hopes and expectations of the Nation--as those might have been unwise: at all events, the words ought to have stood--the just and reasonable hopes of the Nation. But the hacknied phrase of 'disappointed hopes and expectations'--should not have been used at all: it is a centre round which much delusion has gathered. The Convention not only did not satisfy the Nation's hopes of good; but sunk it into a pitfall of unimagined and unimaginable evil. The hearts and understandings of the People tell them that the language of a proposed parliamentary resolution, upon this occasion, ought--not only to have been different in the letter--but also widely different in the spirit: and the reader of these pages will have deduced, that no terms of reprobation could in severity exceed the offences involved in--and connected with--that instrument. But, while the grand keep of the castle of iniquity was to be stormed, we have seen nothing but a puny assault upon heaps of the scattered rubbish of the fortress; nay, for the most part, on some accidental mole-hills at its base. I do not speak thus in disrespect to the Right Hon. Gentleman who headed this attack. His mind, left to itself, would (I doubt not) have prompted something worthier and higher: but he moves in the phalanx of Party;--a spiritual Body; in which (by strange inconsistency) the hampering, weakening, and destroying, of every individual mind of which it is composed--is the law which must constitute the strength of the whole. The question was--whether principles, affecting the very existence of Society, had not been violated; and an arm lifted, and let fall, which struck at the root of Honour; with the aggravation of the crime having been committed at this momentous period. But what relation is there between these principles and actions, and being in Place or out of it? If the People would constitutionally and resolutely assert their rights, their Representatives would be taught another lesson; and for their own profit. Their understandings would be enriched accordingly: for it is there--there where least suspected--that the want, from which this country suffers, chiefly lies. They err, who suppose that venality and corruption (though now spreading more and more) are the master-evils of this day: neither these nor immoderate craving for power are so much to be deprecated, as the non-existence of a widely-ranging intellect; of an intellect which, if not efficacious to infuse truth as a vital fluid into the heart, might at least make it a powerful tool in the hand. Outward profession,--which, for practical purposes, is an act of most desirable subservience,--would then wait upon those objects to which inward reverence, though not felt, was known to be due. Schemes of ample reach and <b>true</b> <b>benefit</b> would also promise best to insure the rewards coveted by personal ambition: and men of baser passions, finding it their interest, would naturally combine to perform useful service under the direction of strong minds: while men of good intentions would have their own pure satisfaction; and would exert themselves with more upright--I mean, more hopeful--cheerfulness, and more successfully. It is not therefore inordinate desire of wealth or power which is so injurious--as the means which are and must be employed, in the present intellectual condition of the Legislature, to sustain and secure that power: these are at once an effect of barrenness, and a cause; acting, and mutually re-acting, incessantly. An enlightened Friend has, in conversation, observed to the Author of these pages--that formerly the principles of men wore better than they who held them; but that now (a far worse evil!) men are better than their principles. I believe it:--of the deplorable quality and state of principles, the public proceedings in our Country furnish daily new proof. It is however some consolation, at this present crisis, to find--that, of the thoughts and feelings uttered during the two debates which led me to these painful declarations, such--as approach towards truth which has any dignity in it--come from the side of his Majesty's Ministers.--But note again those contradictions to which I have so often been obliged to advert. The Ministers advise his Majesty publicly to express sentiments of disapprobation upon the Convention of Cintra; and, when the question of the merits or demerits of this instrument comes before them in Parliament, the same persons--who, as advisers of the crown, lately condemned the treaty--now, in their character of representatives of the people, by {{the manner in which they}} received this motion, have pronounced an encomium upon it. For, though (as I have said) the motion was inaccurately and inadequately worded, it was not set aside upon this ground. And the Parliament has therefore persisted in withholding, from the insulted and injured People and from their Allies, the only reparation which perhaps it may be in its power to grant; has refused to signify its repentance and sorrow for what hath been done; without which, as a previous step, there can be no proof--no gratifying intimation, even to this Country or to its Allies, that the future efforts of the British Parliament are in a sincere spirit. The guilt of the transaction therefore being neither repented of, nor atoned for; the course of evil is, by necessity, persevered in.--But let us turn to a brighter region.|$|E

40|$|For {{the most}} part, the {{differences}} between the analysis of an owner-operated private venture project and that of typical public-sector projects are concentrated in the valuation of benefits. Most project costs are indeed cash outlays, just like those of a business venture, but this is not at all generally <b>true</b> on the <b>benefits</b> side. For example, public parks and highways (other than toll roads) rarely yield any cash inflows. The problem then is to find ways of estimating the true economic value of their benefits. In other cases (e. g., irrigation projects and toll roads), there is usually some charge {{for the use of the}} project’s output, but that charge is typically a very poor measure of the project’s <b>true</b> <b>benefits.</b> Again the challenge is to measure the <b>true</b> <b>benefits</b> of the project. Electricity projects appear to be in a different category, in that one hardly ever sees attempts to measure the actual benefits that users receive from such projects.

5000|$|Announced to {{the public}} in early 1996 at an NRA convention, the 9×23mm Winchester {{cartridge}} was claimed to have the lowest recoiling load and still qualify for Major Power Factor designation in the IPSC. The IPSC Power Factor (PF) is equal to bullet weight in grains times muzzle velocity divided by 1,000. A PF of at least 175 was needed to qualify as Major within the Power Factor designation used within IPSC competitions. A Minor power factor carried scoring penalties and so there was an incentive to make the Major qualification. As the power factor calculation is proportional to bullet momentum and as the very large proportion of recoil is proportional to bullet momentum, it is immediately clear that the 9×23mm Winchester had essentially the same power factor and recoil as [...]45 ACP. The <b>true</b> <b>benefit</b> of the 9×23mm Winchester came from two things. Firstly, more rounds could be fitted into the magazine and that, in general, allowed fewer magazine changes {{to be made in the}} course of a contest task spread over multiple targets. Secondly, the higher operating pressure of the 9×23mm Winchester meant that a compensated pistol, where holes or slots in the barrel project high pressure gas upwards before the bullet leaves the barrel, had a greater ability to reduce the upward flip of the muzzle under recoil. That meant that users of the 9×23mm Winchester were able to return to target in less time than with a compensated [...]45 ACP pistol of otherwise identical design. Since speed was a major element in the scoring system within IPSC competitions there was an obvious advantage to the 9×23mm Winchester over the [...]45 ACP.|$|E

Each individual can lower his tax cost by under reporting his benefits derived from the public good or service. This informational problem shows that survey-based Lindahl taxation is not incentive compatible.
