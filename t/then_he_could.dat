5|$|Around 5:30a.m. on December 15, 39 police {{officers}} and four volunteers approached Sitting Bull's house. They surrounded the house, knocked and entered. Lt. Bull Head told Sitting Bull that he was under arrest and led him outside. Sitting Bull and his wife noisily stalled for time, the camp awakened and men converged at the house. As Lt. Bullhead ordered Sitting Bull to mount a horse, he said the Indian Affairs agent needed to see the chief, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> return to his house. When Sitting Bull refused to comply, the police used force on him. The Sioux in the village were enraged. Catch-the-Bear, a Lakota, shouldered his rifle and shot Lt. Bullhead, who reacted by firing his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull. Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and he dropped to the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m.|$|E
5|$|Harvey was an attacking and {{free-flowing}} batsman {{but he was}} not {{a prolific}} scorer, which was attributed by observers to a lack of single-mindedness required to succeed at the top level. Neil said that Ray's footwork was suspect and that the stronger bowlers in domestic cricket were able to exploit this. Neil said that if Ray had been able to rectify his weakness, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have become a Test player for Australia. Australian captain Bill Lawry said that Harvey was one of the two best district cricketers he had faced. Aside from his batting, Harvey was an occasional leg spinner, and was known for his fielding ability.|$|E
5|$|Though {{he would}} later become indelibly {{associated}} with Stoke City, Matthews grew up supporting that club's local rivals Port Vale. His father wanted him to follow in his footsteps and become a boxer, but Stanley decided {{at the age of}} 13 {{that he wanted to be}} a footballer. After a rigorous training session that made Matthews vomit, his mother, Elizabeth, stood firm and made Jack realise that his son, who had one more year at school, should follow his passion of football. His father conceded that should he be picked for England Schoolboys <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> continue his footballing career; around this time his school football master picked Matthews as an outside-right, rather than as his then-preferred position of centre-half. Matthews played for England Schoolboys against Wales in 1929, in front of around 20,000 spectators at Dean Court, Bournemouth.|$|E

5|$|To Brodie, Jefferson’s {{ambiguous}} posturings on slavery {{could be}} explained by his personal life. If he had been conducting a 28-year affair with a slave, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not free his slaves because once they were freed, Virginia law would force them from the state, unless he gained permission from the legislature for them to stay. He could continue his liaison with Hemings only if his slaves remained slaves. Two of the most prominent Jefferson biographers of the twentieth century, Dumas Malone and Merrill Peterson, had relied on Jefferson family testimony by two Randolph grandchildren who named his Carr nephews as fathers. They discounted other evidence about this alleged sexual relationship, including by Madison Hemings in 1873, who identified Jefferson as his father. The relationship was first reported in 1802 by the journalist James T. Callender when Jefferson was President, after Callender failed to win an appointment by the president.|$|E

25|$|It {{is highly}} likely that Eggestein even {{travelled}} to Mainz {{himself in the}} 1450s to learn the art of book printing from Gutenberg. When this was and how long the stay lasted cannot be definitely resolved, due to sketchy source materials. Ferdinand Geldner holds the view that Eggestein was already in Mainz in 1454 and that might be why he lost the office of Siegelbewahrer in Strasbourg in 1455. If this were the case, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have watched the printing of the 42-line-per-page Gutenberg Bible firsthand. Geldner further suspects that Heinrich Eggestein actively participated in the typesetting and printing of the Türkenkalender, which was completed {{in the middle of}} December in 1454. He did not give up his Strasbourg citizen's rights until August 1457, however. If he had left Alsace so late, he would have admittedly arrived in Mainz after the break between Gutenberg and Johann Fust.|$|E

25|$|Laake reached {{minister}} Ljungberg {{by telephone}} at 0200hrs and discussed mobilizing the army. Laake suggested mobilizing the 1st to the 4th Brigades of the army, meaning {{most of the}} forces ready for mobilization in Eastern, Southern and Western Norway. This was the most wide-ranging of the mobilization alternatives that Laake had proposed on 8 April. Ljungberg quickly received approval from the government, and relayed the message to Laake. The government had agreed with a mobilization and left it to the military {{to decide on the}} details. After the telephone conversation, an argument quickly broke out between Laake and Hatledal. Hatledal viewed the mobilization in question was inadequate and wanted a total and open mobilization, rather than the silent and partial mobilization by mail that Laake was organizing. Laake stated that if Hatledal wanted an open mobilization <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> discuss it with minister Ljungberg when the minister arrived at the general staff at Akershus Fortress.|$|E
25|$|Mussolini {{had sought}} to delay a major war in Europe until at least 1942, but Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939. This {{resulted}} in declarations of war by France and the UK {{and the start of}} World War II. On 10 June 1940—with the Fall of France imminent—Italy officially entered the war on the side of Germany, though he was aware that Italy did not have the military capacity and resources to carry out a long war with the British Empire. Mussolini believed that after the imminent French armistice, Italy could gain territorial concessions from France and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> concentrate his forces on a major offensive in North Africa, where British and Commonwealth forces were outnumbered by Italian forces. However, the UK government refused to accept proposals for a peace that would involve accepting Axis victories in Eastern and Western Europe, plans for an invasion of the UK did not proceed and the war continued. In the summer of 1941, Mussolini sent Italian forces to participate in the invasion of the Soviet Union and war with the United States followed in December.|$|E

The gibbet was about [...] from the boundary of the area, and if the condemned person succeeded in escaping from the forest <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not legally be brought back to face his punishment. At least two men succeeded in cheating the executioner in that way: a man named Dinnis and another called Lacy. Dinnis was never seen in Halifax again, but Lacy rather unwisely decided to return to the town seven years after his escape; he was apprehended and finally executed in 1623.|$|E

Dawson explained that Darren initially thought faking Jack's death was a [...] "brilliant idea" [...] but put this down to lack of sleep and stress. Dawson commented that Darren and Jack are so desperate that [...] "everything seemed easy", but added that they realise their actions were making the situation worse. Dawson felt that if Darren gets through the events without becoming bitter, twisted and cynical, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> learn from his mistakes but [...] "it could go the other way and he might blame everyone other than himself". Dawson commented that the fake death scam was his favourite time with the serial.|$|E
500|$|As a boy, {{inventor}} George Escol Sellers knew Eckfeldt; as Sellers's {{father was}} {{partner in a}} firm which sold machinery to the Mint Bureau, Eckfeldt often dined at his house. [...] In the final years both of the 19th century and of Sellers's life, he published his memoirs, including memories of the first Philadelphia Mint. [...] He recalled in 1812 peering through a window to see cents coined, and Eckfeldt coming into the room to stop the work {{at the end of}} the day. [...] Seeing the young Sellers, he had the boy come in, had him place a cent planchet on the press, and struck it for him. [...] Sellers nearly dropped it because it was so hot, and Eckfeldt reminded him it had been cold when placed in the press. Eckfeldt bade him keep the coin until he learned why the cent had become hot, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> spend it on candy.|$|E
500|$|As a {{coronation}} sword, Szczerbiec {{was first}} specifically mentioned by Jan Długosz {{in his account}} of the crowning of King Casimir IV (...) , but it was probably first used in a coronation ceremony by King Vladislaus the Elbow-High (...) in 1320, by which time he had reunited most of the core territories of Poland. If Szczerbiec had previously belonged to his uncle, Boleslaus I of Masovia, or his father-in-law, Boleslaus the Pious, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have inherited it. If it had belonged to any of the two Boleslauses who had ruled from Kraków as high dukes of all Poland, then Vladislaus could have simply found it in the Wawel Cathedral. Thereafter, Szczerbiec became {{an integral part of the}} Polish Crown Jewels, shared their fate, and was the principal ceremonial sword used in coronations of all Polish kings until 1764, except Vladislaus II Jogaila (1386), Stephen Báthory (1576), Stanislaus I Leszczyński (1705), and Augustus III Wettin (1734).|$|E

500|$|One of the conspirators, Thomas Percy, was {{promoted}} in June 1604, {{gaining access to}} a house in London that belonged to John Whynniard, Keeper of the King's Wardrobe. [...] Fawkes was installed as a caretaker and began using the pseudonym John Johnson, servant to Percy. [...] The contemporaneous account of the prosecution (taken from Thomas Wintour's confession) claimed that the conspirators attempted to dig a tunnel from beneath Whynniard's house to Parliament, although this story {{may have been a}} government fabrication; no evidence for the existence of a tunnel was presented by the prosecution, and no trace of one has ever been found; Fawkes himself did not admit the existence of such a scheme until his fifth interrogation, but even <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not locate the tunnel. [...] If the story is true, however, by December 1604 the conspirators were busy tunnelling from their rented house to the House of Lords. [...] They ceased their efforts when, during tunnelling, they heard a noise from above. [...] Fawkes was sent out to investigate, and returned with the news that the tenant's widow was clearing out a nearby undercroft, directly beneath the House of Lords.|$|E
500|$|Cantor's {{first ten}} papers were on number theory, his thesis topic. At the {{suggestion}} of Eduard Heine, the Professor at Halle, Cantor turned to analysis. Heine proposed that Cantor solve an open problem that had eluded Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, Rudolf Lipschitz, Bernhard Riemann, and Heine himself: {{the uniqueness of the}} representation of a function by trigonometric series. Cantor solved this difficult problem in 1869. It was while working on this problem that he discovered transfinite ordinals, which occurred as indices n in the nth derived set S'n of a set S of zeros of a trigonometric series. Given a trigonometric series f(x) with S as its set of zeros, Cantor had discovered a procedure that produced another trigonometric series that had S1 as its set of zeros, where S1 is the set of limit points of S. If S'k+1 is the set of limit points of S'k, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> construct a trigonometric series whose zeros are S'k+1. Because the sets S'k were closed, they contained their Limit points, and the intersection of the infinite decreasing sequence of sets S, S1, S2, S3,... formed a limit set, which we would now call S'ω, and then he noticed that Sω would also have to have a set of limit points Sω+1, and so on. He had examples that went on forever, and so here was a naturally occurring infinite sequence of infinite numbers ω, ω+1, ω+2, ...|$|E
