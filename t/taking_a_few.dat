5|$|First Army formed up in {{preparation}} to {{advance in the}} Meuse-Argonne campaign. It consisted of over 600,000 men in I Corps, III Corps, and V Corps. III Corps took the Army's east flank, protecting it as the Army advanced to Montfaucon, then Cunel and Romagne-sous-Montfaucon. The offensive was slow and hampered by inexperience {{of many of the}} divisions under the Army's command, though III Corps was effective in protecting its sector. They advanced through September and October, <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks for rest after the formation of Second United States Army. On 1 November, the First Army went on a general offensive, pushing north to the Meuse River and the Barricourt Ridge. It was successful, pushing German forces back and advancing to the river {{until the end of the}} war. Around that time, the division received its shoulder sleeve insignia, approving it by telegram, though the insignia would not be officially authorized until 1922.|$|E

Cage then made his way the ring, where he grabbed a microphone and announced his intentions to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship held by Jeff Jarrett, after <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> shots at his former employer. Coach Scott D'Amore and Bobby Roode of the villainous Team Canada alliance then {{made their way to}} the ring. D'Amore then offered Cage a position in Team Canada (since Reso is Canadian) and even giving him a Team Canada T-shirt and telling Cage to take his time on making a decision. Later in the night after the main event, a six-man tag team match pitting the team of Jarrett and America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) (AMW) against Rhino and Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon), Cage ran down to the ring while Team Canada (D'Amore, Roode, Eric Young, and A-1), AMW, and Jarrett were assaulting Rhino and Team 3D. After Cage entered the ring, he removed the jacket he was wearing to reveal the Team Canada T-shirt he was given earlier by D'Amore. D'Amore immediately rejoiced that Cage was seemingly a member of Team Canada until Cage turned on D'Amore and performed his Unprettier maneuver; Cage's act also solidified his character as a face. Cage, Rhino, and Team 3D attacked AMW and Team Canada and threw them out of the ring; they then forced the remaining Jarrett through a wooden table after Cage removed his Team Canada shirt to reveal a hidden TNA T-shirt.|$|E

25|$|At Liberty Gap, 6 {{miles to}} the west, a similar battle occurred. The leading {{elements}} of McCook's advance was the 39th Indiana, commanded by Col. Thomas J.

Not waiting for the main infantry support to arrive, McCook ordered the brigade of Brig. Gen. August Willich to move forward as quickly as possible. Deploying a regiment {{on each side of the}} road, Willich's men drove up the slope. A frontal assault against the breastworks was not feasible, so a fierce battle of flanking maneuvers resulted against the Confederate brigades of Brig. Gens. St. John R. Liddell and Patrick R.

25|$|Botulinum toxin causes muscle paralysis/atrophy by {{inhibition}} of acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions. Botox injections {{are used in}} bruxism {{on the theory that}} a dilute solution of the toxin will partially paralyze the muscles and lessen their ability to forcefully clench and grind the jaw, while aiming to retain enough muscular function to enable normal activities such as talking and eating. This treatment typically involves five or six injections into the masseter and temporalis muscles, and less often into the lateral pterygoids (given the possible risk of decreasing the ability to swallow) <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes per side. The effects may be noticeable by the next day, and they may last for about three months. Occasionally, adverse effects may occur, such as bruising, but this is quite rare. The dose of toxin used depends upon the person, and a higher dose may be needed in people with stronger muscles of mastication. With the temporary and partial muscle paralysis, atrophy of disuse may occur, meaning that the future required dose may be smaller or the length of time the effects last may be increased.|$|E

25|$|The second great {{siege of}} Corfu {{took place in}} 1716, during the last Ottoman–Venetian War (1714–18). After the conquest of the Peloponnese in 1715, the Ottoman fleet {{appeared}} in Buthrotum opposite Corfu. On 8 July the Ottoman fleet, carrying 33,000 men, sailed to Corfu from Buthrotum and established a beachhead at Ipsos. The same day, the Venetian fleet encountered the Ottoman fleet off the channel of Corfu and defeated it in the ensuing naval battle. On 19 July, after <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> outlying forts, the Ottoman army reached the hills around the city of Corfu and laid siege to it. Despite repeated assaults and heavy fighting, the Ottomans were unable to breach the defences and were forced to raise the siege after 22 days. The 5,000 Venetians and foreign mercenaries, together with 3,000 Corfiotes, {{under the leadership of}} Count von der Schulenburg who commanded the defence of the island, were victorious once more. The success was owed in no small part to the extensive fortifications, where Venetian castle engineering had proven itself once again against considerable odds. The repulse of the Ottomans was widely celebrated in Europe, Corfu being seen as a bastion of Western civilization against the Ottoman tide. Today, however, this role is often relatively unknown or ignored, but was celebrated in Juditha triumphans by the Venetian composer Antonio Vivaldi.|$|E

500|$|Ultima Underworld II was {{developed}} in nine months. It was originally slated for a February 1993 release, but the date was later moved up to December 1992.

Church went to Origin's headquarters in Texas during the final stages of development. The team [...] "tried desperately to make Christmas", and the game was completed around December 18. Church compiled the final version on his laptop in Spector's office. However, the game was held back for further playtesting even though it could have shipped on schedule. Church later commented, [...] "here was one bug we couldn't reproduce, and everyone really wanted to go home for Christmas.

500|$|Slant Magazine writer Sal Cinquemani {{compared}} the album unfavorably to In the Zone, saying that although Blackout [...] "scores well, and its hotness quotient is remarkably high, [...] isn't {{much of a}} step forward for Britney following 2003's surprisingly strong In the Zone, for which she received a writing credit on {{a majority of the}} songs (as opposed to a scant three here)." [...] Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club said Blackout [...] "counts both as a significant event and as a disquieting aberration that couldn't be more mysteriously manufactured or bizarrely ill-timed" [...] in which [...] "every song counts as markedly progressive and strange." [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian called it [...] "a bold, exciting album: the question is whether anyone will be able to hear its contents over the deafening roar of tittle-tattle." [...] He elaborated that when faced with a public image in freefall, an artist has two options: making music [...] "that harks back to your golden, pre-tailspin days" [...] to [...] "underlin your complete normality" [...] or [...] "to throw caution to the wind: given your waning fortunes, what's the harm in <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> musical risks?" [...] Petridis commented that Spears opted for the latter and the results were [...] "largely fantastic." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times said, [...] "The electronic beats and bass lines are as thick as Ms. Spears's voice is thin, and as the album title suggests, the general mood is bracingly unapologetic." [...] Sanneh added that said Spears became a spectral presence in her own album, explaining that when compared to her previous records, [...] " [...] cuts a startlingly low profile on Blackout [...] Even when she was being marketed as a clean-cut ex-Mouseketeer, and even when she was touring the country with a microphone that functioned largely as a prop, something about her was intense." [...] Peter Robinson of The Observer stated that Spears [...] "delivered the best album of her career, raising the bar for modern pop music with an incendiary mix of Timbaland's Shock Value and her own back catalogue." [...] The Phoenixs Ellee Dean said the album [...] "may be more a tribute to the skills of the A-list producers who guided her through the disc than to any of her own talents. But at least she was smart enough to accept that guidance." [...] In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+ and said that [...] "From 'Gimme More's 'It's Britney bitch' hiya to 'Piece of Me's single-of-the-year sonics, from 'Ooh Ooh Baby's 'feel you deep inside' to 'Perfect Lover's 'touch me there', this album is pure, juicy, plastic get-naked."
