Verbesina occidentalis attracts the <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle.</b> The <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> is {{attracted}} to the plant for two reasons. It is believed that the <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> is attracted to Verbesina occidentalis due to its coloration. The <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> is also yellow and can hide among the flowers. The <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> will also drink the nectar from the plant. When the <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> drinks the nectar it does not harm the plant. Both the adult and larva of the <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> will prey on other insects. The adult <b>soldier</b> <b>beetles</b> will eat the aphids, caterpillars, grasshopper eggs and mites. The larva of the <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> hatches in the spring. The larva <b>soldier</b> <b>beetles</b> prey upon insect eggs, larva, snails, and slugs. The <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> lays its eggs in the late summer.|$|R

Studying insects’ {{response}} to disturbance {{can tell us}} how these organisms survive in hostile environments. Studies have shown that <b>soldier</b> <b>beetles</b> can have different mating behaviors depending on the species around them (Bernstein and Bernstein, 1999). They also exercise selective mating in changing ecological conditions (McLain, 2005). When disturbed, beetles are known to drop off plants onto the ground {{in order to get}} away from possible predators (Ben-Ari and Inbar, 2013). The goal of this experiment was to determine any trends in {{response to}} a probing disturbance by insects and more specifically, <b>soldier</b> <b>beetles.</b> I believed probing <b>soldier</b> <b>beetles</b> with a small disturbance would cause them {{to move away from the}} source of the disturbance, with individuals responding more than mating pairs. After collecting and analyzing the data, the conclusion is that the hypothesis is supported by having a greater reaction from individuals than mating pairs. These results suggest that an insect’s tolerance to disturbance increases when mating. This may lead to a decrease in survival behavior in order to fulfill mating interests...|$|R
50|$|Chauliognathus is a genus of <b>soldier</b> <b>beetles</b> in {{the family}} Cantharidae. Adults have almost {{rectangular}} bodies. Some are red and black, similar to the military uniforms that were common before the usage of camouflage, hence the name of <b>soldier</b> <b>beetles.</b> Others are orange and black. The elytra or first pair of wings are softer than the elytra of most beetles, that is why their other common name is leatherwings. The adults are frequently found on flowers, such as sunflowers, goldenrod, coneflowers, where they mate and feed on pollen and nectar. The larvae are {{more common in the}} ground or among debris, where they feed on eggs or larvae of other insects. The adults are most frequently found in summer and early fall.They are native to America.|$|R

40|$|The family Cantharidae is a {{worldwide}} distributed group of flattened and soft-bodied beetles displaying aposematic colouration. These beetles, {{commonly known as}} <b>soldier</b> <b>beetles,</b> have an extensive fossil record {{dating back to the}} Lower Cretaceous. The majority of fossil material, referred to Cantharidae, is known from amber inclusions. In this paper we describe and illustrate a new <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> Kuskaella macroptera gen. et sp. nov. from the Baltic amber. It is characterised by pronotum of the male parallel-sided in basal third and abruptly narrowed towards apex, and of the female gradually and steadily narrowing from the basal margin to the apex; globular head; unequal maxillary palpomeres with the last segment elongated-globular and pointed; long elytra slightly surpassing the last abdominal segment.

40|$|The {{preprint}} of "A new genus {{and species}} of <b>soldier</b> <b>beetle</b> from Upper Cretaceous Burmese amber (Coleoptera, Cantharidae, Malthininae) ". Abstract. A new Upper Cretaceous {{genus and species}} of <b>soldier</b> <b>beetles,</b> Archaeomalthodes rosetta gen. et sp. nov., is described and illustrated from an individual preserved in Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian, ca. 99 Ma) amber from northern Myanmar. It is undoubtedly placed in extant subfamily Malthininae based on its small-sized body, somewhat abbreviated elytra and fusiform terminal maxillary palpomere, representing the oldest documented occurrence of Malthininae. It suggests that this subfamily is an ancient group, which originated {{at least in the}} earliest Late Cretaceous. Our discovery sheds light on the palaeodiversity of Cantharidae in the Late Mesozoic. Together with other previously reported fossil cantharids, it is likely that Malthininae has been fairly speciose during the early evolution of Cantharidae. On the other hand, a morphological similarity between Archaeomalthodes and Recent malthinines and the occurrence of flowering plants in the Burmese amber implies a potential flower-visiting behaviour of this fossil species...|$|R
