5|$|Daniel Pinkerton is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of the Uncharted: Eye of Indra motion comic. Fred Tatasciore provides his voice. Pinkerton is an American who has become a crime boss in Indonesia. Pinkerton hires Drake, who is seeking the funds to raise the coffin of Francis Drake, to find the valuable Eye of Indra. After discovering that Pinkerton has unknowingly had the Eye in his safe the whole time, Drake attempts to retrieve it by raiding Pinkerton's home. Pinkerton captures Drake, and tortures him when he refuses to reveal the treasure's location. When Drake eventually reveals the location of <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Indra, Rika Raja shoots and kills Pinkerton, and the two take <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Indra for themselves.|$|E
5|$|In another temple ritual, the pharaoh {{played a}} {{ceremonial}} game {{in honor of}} the Eye goddesses Hathor, Sekhmet, or Tefnut, in which he struck a ball symbolizing <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Apep with a club made from a type of wood that was said to have sprung from <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Ra. The ritual represents, in a playful form, the battle of Ra's Eye with its greatest foe.|$|E
5|$|Ra's {{enemies are}} {{the forces of}} chaos, which {{threaten}} maat, the cosmic order that he creates. They include both humans who spread disorder and cosmic powers like Apep, the embodiment of chaos, whom Ra and the gods who accompany him in his barque are said to combat every night. The malevolent gaze of Apep's own Eye is a potent weapon against Ra, and Ra's Eye {{is one of the}} few powers that can counteract it. Some unclear passages in the Coffin Texts suggest that Apep was thought capable of injuring or stealing <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Ra from its master during the combat. In other texts, the Eye's fiery breath assists in Apep's destruction. This apotropaic function of <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Ra is another point of overlap with <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Horus, which was similarly believed to ward off evil.|$|E
60|$|Yet was {{the smile}} tender, for in <b>the</b> child's <b>eyes</b> I saw <b>the</b> woman eternal, {{the woman of}} all times and appearances. In her <b>eyes</b> I saw <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> my mate of the jungle and tree-top, of the cave and the squatting- place. In her <b>eyes</b> I saw <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> Igar when I was Ushu <b>the</b> archer, <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> Arunga when I was <b>the</b> rice-harvester, <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> Selpa when I dreamed of bestriding <b>the</b> stallion, <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> Nuhila who leaned to the thrust of my sword. Yes, there was that in her eyes that made them <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> Lei-Lei whom I left with a laugh on my lips, <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lady Om for forty years my beggar-mate on highway and byway, <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> Philippa for whom I was slain on the grass in old France, <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>of</b> my mother when I was the lad Jesse at the Mountain Meadows {{in the circle of}} our forty great wagons.|$|R

5|$|The myth's {{religious}} importance {{extended beyond}} the funerary sphere. Mortuary offerings, in which {{family members or}} hired priests presented food to the deceased, were logically linked with the mythological offering of <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Horus to Osiris. By analogy, this episode of the myth was eventually equated with other interactions between a human and a being in the divine realm. In temple offering rituals, the officiating priest took {{on the role of}} Horus, the gifts to the deity became <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Horus, and whichever deity received these gifts was momentarily equated with Osiris.|$|E
5|$|The {{tears of}} <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Ra {{are part of}} a more general {{connection}} between the Eye and moisture. In addition to representing the morning star, the Eye can also be equated with the star Sothis (Sirius). Every summer, {{at the start of the}} Egyptian year, Sothis' heliacal rising, in which the star rose above the horizon just before the sun itself, heralded the start of the Nile inundation, which watered and fertilized Egypt's farmland. Therefore, <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Ra precedes and represents the floodwaters that restore fertility to all of Egypt.|$|E

5|$|Diermot {{enters the}} dragon's cave and wakes him up. The dragon agrees to help Diermot, {{revealing}} that Turnvale was {{the domain of}} a demon long before humans came to the area. This demon should have died along with his breed long ago, but did not perish because {{it was able to}} feed on man's greed and ambition in order to survive. The demon was driven out by the great Gethryn, but the young sorceress Selena's meddling with evil has reawakened the demon, and it controls her mortal form. The dragon possesses <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Gethryn, an enchanted stone left by Gethryn {{at the time of his}} death. The stone contains the power to defeat the demon, and the dragon then gives the stone to Diermot. A Skorl named Wayne, who turns against Selena, sneaks Diermot into Selena's castle in a barrel. Diermot defeats Selena with <b>the</b> <b>Eye</b> <b>of</b> Gethryn, freeing Turnvale from her tyranny.|$|E
