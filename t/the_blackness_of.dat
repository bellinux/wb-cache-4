5|$|The Cunningham–Rawnsley team {{used the}} AI {{specifically}} to position themselves directly astern and underneath the enemy. Although the German bombers carried a dorsal gunner, {{it was difficult}} to locate an enemy against the black colour of the landscape. Usually <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> <b>of</b> the country would swallow up the outline of an approaching night fighter. As they approached, the slipstream of the enemy could prove hazardous; bucking the Beaufighter and throwing the pilot off his aim. Approaching from slightly below allowed the attacking pilot to avoid the slipstream. The tactics allowed for Cunningham to close the range and fire first, which was usually sufficient to end the engagement quickly and successfully. Bob Braham, a rival night fighter ace, also used this tactic.|$|E
25|$|By midnight, Lookout Mountain was quiet. Pettus and Holtzclaw {{received}} orders at 2 a.m. {{to march}} off the mountain. Postwar writings of both Union and Confederate veterans {{refer to a}} brilliant moon, which slipped into <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> <b>of</b> a total lunar eclipse, screening the Confederate withdrawal. That night Bragg, stunned by the defeat on Lookout Mountain, asked his two corps commanders whether to retreat from Chattanooga or to stand and fight. Hardee counseled retreat, but Breckinridge convinced Bragg to fight {{it out on the}} strong position of Missionary Ridge. Accordingly, the troops withdrawn from Lookout Mountain were ordered to the left flank of Bragg's army.|$|E

Whedon served as an executive producer, along with Tim Minear.

The ensemble cast portrays the nine characters who live on Serenity. Whedon pitched the show as [...] "nine people looking into <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> <b>of</b> space and seeing nine different things".|$|E

500|$|In each panel, Dyer {{is framed}} by a doorway, and set against a flat, {{anonymous}} foreground coloured with black and brown hues. In the left frame, he is seated on a toilet with his head crouched between his knees as if in pain. Although his arched back, thighs and legs are according to the Irish critic Colm Tóibín, [...] "lovingly painted", Dyer is by now clearly a broken man. The central panel shows Dyer sitting on the toilet bowl in a more contemplative pose, his head and upper body writhing beneath a hanging lightbulb which throws a large bat-like shadow formed {{in the shape of}} a demon or Eumenide. The art critic Sally Yard has noted that in the portrayal of Dyer's flesh, [...] "life seems to visibly drain... into the substantial character of the shadow beneath him". Dyer's posture suggests he is seated on a lavatory bowl, though the object is not described. Schmied has proposed that in this frame <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> <b>of</b> the background has enveloped the subject, and it [...] "seems to be advancing forward over the threshold, threatening the viewer like a flood or a giant bat with flapping wings and extended claws." ...|$|E
500|$|The Alouette {{was then}} hit and, {{although}} only lightly damaged, forced to withdraw, leaving the ground troops without covering MAG fire. Now {{covered by the}} Rhodesian ground troops and Frantans dropped by Percival Provosts, the South Africans made several unsuccessful attempts to pull back from {{the banks of the}} gully throughout the afternoon which led to two injuries and the death of Constable du Toit. The SAP men were eventually able to withdraw under cover of darkness, while Rhodesian and South African injured were uplifted by helicopter in an action described by Southey as [...] "sheer brilliance". [...] "Norman Walsh and Peter Nicholls [...] faced great difficulty because of steep mountainsides and <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> <b>of</b> the night in conditions of thick haze," [...] writes Peter Petter-Bowyer, then an RRAF flight lieutenant. [...] "Visual contact with [...] ground [...] impossible until dangerously low and close." [...] Flying at such low altitude, each pilot was blinded by the reflection of his own landing light when he looked towards the ground. Walsh noticed that he could clearly see the ground beneath the other helicopter's light, and so instructed Nicholls to turn off his landing light and allow him to illuminate the landing site for him. [...] "This worked like a charm," [...] says Petter-Bowyer. Guided by Walsh's landing light, Nicholls safely landed and collected some of the casualties, then did the same for Walsh as he picked up the rest. Flares were dropped during the night to help the ground troops search for guerrilla movement but none was seen.|$|E

2500|$|The French {{have already}} {{discovered}} that <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> <b>of</b> {{the skin is}} no reason a human being should be abandoned without redress to the caprice of a tormentor. It may one day come to be recognized {{that the number of}} the legs, the villosity of the skin, or the termination of the os sacrum are reasons equally insufficient for abandoning a sensitive being to the same fate. What else is it that should trace the insuperable line? Is it the faculty of reason or perhaps the faculty of discourse? But a full-grown horse or dog, is beyond comparison a more rational, as well as a more conversable animal, than an infant of a day or a week or even a month, old. But suppose the case were otherwise, what would it avail? the question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer? ...|$|E
2500|$|In Kindred, Butler also {{represents}} individual slaves as {{people rather than}} non-humans, giving each {{his or her own}} story. Robert Crossley argues that Butler treats <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> <b>of</b> her characters as [...] "a matter of course" [...] to resist the tendency of white writers to incorporate African-Americans into their narratives just to illustrate a problem or to divorce themselves from charges of racism. Thus, in Kindred the slave community is depicted as a [...] "rich human society": the proud yet victimized freewoman-turned-slave Alice; Sam the field slave, who hopes Dana will teach his brother; the traitorous sewing woman Liza, who frustrates Dana's escape; the bright and resourceful Nigel, Rufus's childhood friend who learns to read from a stolen primer; most importantly, Sarah the cook, who Butler transforms from an image of the submissive, happy [...] "mammie" [...] of white fiction to a deeply angry yet caring woman subdued only by the threat of losing her last child, the mute Carrie.|$|E

2500|$|American author Ralph Ellison wrote {{a tribute}} to the book in the prologue of his 1952 novel Invisible Man. According to Ellison biographer Arnold Rampersad, the {{character}} of the narrator [...] "resembles no one else in previous fiction so much as he resembles Ishmael of Moby-Dick". Ellison acknowledges his debt in the prologue to the novel, where the narrator remembers a moment of truth under the influence of marijuana, and evocates a church service: [...] "Brothers and sisters, my text this morning is the 'Blackness of Blackness.' And the congregation answers: 'That blackness is most black, brother, most black...'" [...] In this scene Ellison [...] "reprises a moment in the second chapter of Moby-Dick", where Ishmael wanders around New Bedford {{looking for a place to}} spend the night, and momentarily joins a congregation: [...] "It was a negro church; and the preacher's text was about <b>the</b> <b>blackness</b> <b>of</b> darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there." [...] According to Rampersad, it was Melville who [...] "empowered Ellison to insist on a place in the American literary tradition" [...] by his example of [...] "representing the complexity of race and racism so acutely and generously in his text".|$|E

2500|$|After {{an exhilarating}} flight, Carter arrives at last at the abode of the gods, but finds it empty. Finally a great {{procession}} arrives with much fanfare, {{led by a}} pharaoh-like man who explains to Carter that the gods of earth have seen the city of Carter's dreams and decided to make it their home, and have thus abandoned Kadath. The gods walk no more {{in the ways of}} gods, and have become instead mere denizens of the jewelled city Carter had glimpsed in his dreams. The pharaoh commands Carter to find this city, so that the natural order might be restored. [...] "It is not over unknown seas," [...] he says, [...] "but back over well-known years that your quest must go; back to the bright strange things of infancy and the quick sun-drenched glimpses of magic that old scenes brought to wide young eyes. For know you, that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of what you have seen and loved in youth... These things you saw, Randolph Carter, when your nurse first wheeled you out in the springtime, and they will be the last things you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love."
