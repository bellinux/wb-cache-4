25|$|The company {{developed}} and produced the Rover Imperial motorcycle in November 1902. This was a 3.5hp diamond-framed motorcycle {{with the engine}} in the centre and 'springer' front forks which was ahead of its time. This first Rover motorcycle had innovative features such as a spray carburettor, bottom-bracket engine and mechanically operated valves. With a strong frame with double front down tubes and a good quality finish, over a thousand Rover motorcycles were sold in 1904. The following year, however, Rover stopped motorcycle production to concentrate on their 'safety bicycle' but in 1910 designer John Greenwood was commissioned {{to develop a new}} 3.5hp 500cc engine with spring-loaded tappets, a Bosch magneto and an innovative inverted <b>tooth</b> <b>drive</b> chain. It had a Brown and Barlow carburettor and Druid spring forks. This new model was launched at the 1910 Olympia show and over 500 were sold.|$|E

50|$|Herringfleet Mill is an {{octagonal}} three-storey smock mill with a boat-shaped cap. Winding is by tailpole and winch, {{the last}} mill on the Broads.

50|$|The {{simplest}} freewheel device {{consists of}} two saw-toothed, spring-loaded discs pressing against each other with the toothed sides together, somewhat like a ratchet. Rotating in one direction, the saw <b>teeth</b> of the <b>drive</b> disc lock with the <b>teeth</b> of the <b>driven</b> disc, making it rotate at the same speed. If the drive disc slows down or stops rotating, the <b>teeth</b> of the <b>driven</b> disc slip over the <b>drive</b> disc <b>teeth</b> and continue rotating, producing a characteristic clicking sound proportionate to the speed difference of the driven gear relative {{to that of the}} (slower) driving gear.|$|R
50|$|The M3 was {{succeeded by}} the {{superior}} M4 Sherman. The Allies agreed to standardise on the M4, and MLW began producing the Canadian version, the Grizzly tanks in August 1943. The Grizzly's suspension used 17-tooth drive sprockets and CDP tracks. In comparison, the M4 used 13 <b>tooth</b> <b>drive</b> sprockets. The CDP track was lighter and simpler {{than the standard}} US tracks and did not require rubber, which was scarce since the Japanese advance into Southeast Asia. The Canadian Grizzly tank production halted when it became apparent US production would be sufficient. Instead, MLW produced the Sexton self-propelled gun Mk II. The Sexton Mk II used the Grizzly chassis, with the upper hull modified to carry the Commonwealth standard QF 25 pounder gun. The Sexton was the Commonwealth counterpart to the US M7 Priest. A small batch of Grizzly medium tank was fitted with an Ordnance QF 17-pounder for training but none saw action.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The authors {{proposed}} an electromagnetic harmonic movable <b>tooth</b> <b>drive</b> system {{which is an}} electromechanical coupled system where the coupled dynamics controls its overall operating behavior. However, the coupled dynamics of such a system was {{not found in the}} literature. In this paper, an electromechanical coupled dynamics equation of the flexible ring subjected to electromagnetic force is presented. Using the equation, the natural frequencies and vibration modes of the flexible ring are investigated. The results show that the natural frequency of the drive system is affected by mechanical and electric parameters among which, the coil current, the average static displacement of the flexible ring and the air gap has more obvious influence on the natural frequencies. The results are useful for the design and further study of the dynamics performance for the drive system...|$|E

40|$|Dedicated imaging {{methods are}} among the most {{important}} tools of modern computer-aided medical applications. In the last few years, cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has gained popularity in digital dentistry for 3 D imaging of jawbones and teeth. However, the anatomy of a maxillofacial region complicates the assessment of tooth geometry and anatomical location when using standard orthogonal views of the CT data set. In particular, a tooth is defined by a sub-region, which cannot be easily separated from surrounding tissues by only considering pixel grey-intensity values. For this reason, an image enhancement is usually necessary in order to properly segment tooth geometries. In this paper, an anatomy-driven methodology to reconstruct individual 3 D tooth anatomies by processing CBCT data is presented. The main concept is to generate a small set of multi-planar reformation images along significant views for each target <b>tooth,</b> <b>driven</b> by the individual anatomical geometry of a specific patient. The reformation images greatly enhance the clearness of the target tooth contours. A set of meaningful 2 D tooth contours is extracted and used to automatically model the overall 3 D tooth shape through a B-spline representation. The effectiveness of the methodology has been verified by comparing some anatomy-driven reconstructions of anterior and premolar teeth with those obtained by using standard tooth segmentation tools.

40|$|A {{centralized}} robust {{position control}} for an electrical <b>driven</b> <b>tooth</b> belt <b>drive</b> is designed in this doctoral thesis. Both a cascaded control structure and a PID based position controller are discussed. The {{performance and the}} limitations of the system are analyzed and design principles for the mechanical structure and the control design are given. These design principles are also suitable for most of the motion control applications, where mechanical resonance frequencies and control loop delays are present. One of the major challenges in the design of a controller for machinery applications is that the values of the parameters in the system model (parameter uncertainty) or the system model it self (non-parametric uncertainty) are seldom known accurately in advance. In this thesis a systematic analysis of the parameter uncertainty of the linear tooth beltdrive model is presented and the effect of the variation of a single parameter on the performance of the total system is shown. The total variation of the model parameters is taken into account in the control design phase using a Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT). The thesis also introduces a new method to analyze reference feedforward controllers applying the QFT. The performance of the designed controllers is verified by experimentalmeasurements. The measurements confirm the control design principles that are given in this thesis...|$|R

50|$|The sun and {{planet gear}} {{converted}} the vertical motion of a beam, {{driven by a}} steam engine, into circular motion using a 'planet', a cogwheel fixed {{at the end of the}} connecting rod (connected to the beam) of the engine. With the motion of the beam, this revolved around, and turned, the 'sun', a second rotating cog fixed to the drive shaft, thus generating rotary motion. An interesting feature of this arrangement, when compared to that of a simple crank, is that when both sun and planet have the same number of <b>teeth,</b> the <b>drive</b> shaft completes two revolutions for each double stroke of the beam instead of one. The planet gear is fixed to the connecting rod and thus does not rotate around its own axis.|$|R
