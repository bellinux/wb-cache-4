5|$|As of 2017, twelve Japanese {{films have}} been nominees for Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and one film, Departures, {{has won the}} award. The only Japanese {{directors}} to have multiple films be nominated for the award are Akira Kurosawa and Noboru Nakamura. Kurosawa received an Honorary Award prior to {{the inception of the}} formal award for his work on Rashomon and the actual Academy Award for Dersu Uzala (submitted for <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union), and had four other films submitted, with two of them accepted as nominees. Notably, Kurosawa's 1985 film Ran was deliberately not nominated by the Japanese film industry for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film due to the poor perception he had among Japanese filmmakers at the time. Nakamura had two films, Twin Sisters of Kyoto and Portrait of Chieko, submitted as nominees for the award. Among all the countries that have submitted films for the award, Japan ranks fifth in terms of total nominees, behind Sweden (fourteen nominees) and ahead of <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union (nine nominees).|$|E
5|$|Ashdod {{has seen}} {{much of its}} growth {{as the result of}} {{absorption}} of immigrants. The first settlers were Jewish immigrants from Morocco and Egypt. In the 1960s Ashdod accepted a large number of immigrants from Romania, followed by a large number from Georgia (then part of the Soviet Union) in the 1970s. More than 60,000 Russian Jews from <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union who immigrated to Israel in the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union settled in Ashdod. Recent demographic figures suggest that about 32% of the city's population are new immigrants, 85% of whom are originally from <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union. During the 1990s the city absorbed a large number of Beta Israel immigrants from Ethiopia, and in more recent years Ashdod absorbed a large number of immigrants from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Argentina, and South Africa. Many of the 60,000 Marathi-speaking Bene Israel from Maharashtra, India who moved to Israel also settled there. Ashdod also receives a significant amount of internal migration, especially from the Gush Dan region.|$|E
