25|$|For {{many years}} Edmonds {{has been a}} believer in Spiritualism, in {{particular}} the concept of cosmic ordering, a subject he became interested in after being introduced to Bärbel Mohr's book The Cosmic Ordering Service - A Guide to Realising Your Dreams by his reflexologist. He had not worked on TV {{since the end of}} his BBC TV show Noel's House Party in 1999 and one of his wishes was for a new challenge. Later he was offered the chance to return to TV to work on Deal or No Deal.

If you're not, this video isn't going <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> opinion on the music." [...] Patrizio criticized the video's direction, observing that [...] "the camerawork is full of fast, MTV-style cuts, which, combined with the flashing lights, is more headache-inducing than the music." ...|$|E

Traditionally, men who were graduated first in the class were awarded Julius Rosenwald Fellowships for graduate work at Harvard University, but that university did not accept women. Murray was rejected despite a letter of support from President Roosevelt. She wrote in response, [...] "I would gladly change my sex to meet your requirements, but since the way to such change has not been revealed to me, I have no recourse but to appeal to you <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> minds.

500|$|... "Just A Man" [...] was {{influenced}} by Chinese classical music, Patton's vocal track being based on the style of Anthony Newley. [...] "Star A.D." [...] makes an appearance on the 2008 compilation The Works. When asked if the song was a reference to Kurt Cobain, Mike Patton stated [...] "God no! It's about a phenomenon. And if that guy happened to be one, I don't know. It's {{one of those things}} that happen; it's a Vegas thing. What could be more shameful than having <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> colostomy bag on stage?! Vegas is great, though. I love it. Welcome to America". The song [...] "What a Day" [...] includes the line [...] "Kill the body and the head will die", which was taken from Hunter S. Thompson's 1971 book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. In a late 1994 interview, Bottum described the penultimate track [...] "The Last to Know" [...] as [...] "Pearl Jam on mushrooms".|$|E

[...] Of his political skills, 1980s Ways and Means chair Dan Rostenkowski said, [...] "Charlie has the gifted knack of getting you <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> position, and you actually enjoy doing it. Compromising isn't so unusual in Congress. Enjoying it is." [...] The New York congressman's ability to use humor to catch others off guard before making a political point has been called [...] "Rangeling" [...] by lobbyists and others on Capitol Hill. [...] Many of his closest friends and allies in Congress have not been other African Americans, but white representatives from working class or rural districts; O'Neill aide Chris Matthews said these members were [...] "tied emotionally and culturally to the people they represent." ...|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} episode 7.7 out of 10, praising the plot and the {{introduction}} of Hall/Graviton, but criticizing the amount of humor and MCU references. David Sims of The A.V. Club scored the episode a 'B', calling it [...] "the first episode to show some potential for originality around the corner". He praised the character development, specifically for Coulson and Skye, {{and the introduction}} of Hall/Graviton, but criticized Quinn as [...] "barely a step above a generic Miami Vice villain and whose motives would be totally uninteresting if they were ever made clear to us". He also found Dalton to be [...] "the latest in a line of dull Whedon hunks with just a glimmer of personality." [...] The Guardians Graeme Virtue felt that [...] "If Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. hasn't been levitating your boat so far, this breezy episode probably didn't do that much <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> mind. If you're not in the mood, the endless quipping can seem exhausting, but at least there was some incremental character development." [...] He had especial praise for the introduction of Hall/Graviton, and felt that Hart's performance as the character topped Samuel L. Jackson's cameo from the previous episode.|$|E
500|$|For obZen, Haake {{returned}} to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song [...] "Bleed". In an interview for Gravemusic.com, Haake stated, [...] " [...] was a big effort for me to learn, I {{had to find a}} totally new approach to playing the double bass drums {{to be able to do}} that stuff. I had never really done anything like that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically. So I actually spent as much time practicing that track alone as I did with all of the other tracks combined. It's kind of a big feat <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> approach like that and I'm glad we were able to nail it for the album. For a while though we didn't even know if it was going to make it to the album." [...] Hagström also stated, [...] "obZen is one of the most highly technical offerings the band has ever put to tape". Revolver magazine confirms this statement: [...] "At first listen, obZen seems less challenging to the listener than some of the band's other records, and most of the songs flow smoothly from one syncopated passage to the next. However, careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group's most complicated".|$|E

500|$|In September 2011, Chris meets Warren Burrell (Tony Rickards), a {{homophobic}} customer at the garage. Warren {{makes his}} prejudice against gay people clear to Chris. Mason said Chris was unsure {{how to respond}} to the situation, as he has never met an adult who speaks about gay people in the way Warren does. Chris tells his boss, Lucas Fitzgerald, about Warren, but he is disappointed when Lucas does not do anything about it. Of Chris's situation, Mason explained [...] "It was very confronting for him. And because the guy wasn't pointing his remarks directly at Chris, Lucas didn't understand why Chris was so offended. At first, he didn't have an appreciation of how deep those comments hurt Chris." [...] The storyline divided the opinions of viewers with some understanding why Lucas would not want to confront Warren, while others were on Chris's side. Mason said he was pleased that viewers were discussing the storyline and he admitted he appreciated both sides. The actor said [...] "Lucas wasn't there when the customer was saying these things, so he didn't understand Chris's point of view. However, as the story went along, we saw Lucas change and his respect for Chris grew." [...] Mason added the storyline was about showing understanding for where a person is coming from and being willing <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> ideas.|$|E
500|$|The Escapist gave Last Specter a {{score of}} four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "Another Professor Layton game, another bit of puzzling brilliance. Some of the brain teasers feel a bit {{recycled}} - instead of foxes and chickens, you're shuttling dogs and cats across the river, for example - but there's more than enough variety to warrant doggedly tracking down every last one. But if you only solve the ones you need to move the story forward, that's ok, too." [...] The Guardian gave it four stars out of five, saying, [...] "If you've not {{been a fan of}} the series, this isn't the game that's going <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> mind. For everybody else though, Professor Layton & The Spectre's Call is several days of commute-improving, grey cell stimulation in a mostly effective package. [...] And bravo to Nintendo for keeping this franchise on the standard DS rather than – for the time being, at least – adding that third dimension." [...] However, The Daily Telegraph gave it two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying, [...] "The Layton charm is undoubtedly still present, but it's not enough to carry the series by itself. Upon solving certain puzzles, Layton exclaims 'I love the thrill of a good solution'. So do we, Hershel, so do we. And in this Layton game, sadly, that thrill is all too rare." ...|$|E
500|$|Campbell's {{plans for}} Unknown {{were laid out}} in the February 1939 issue of Astounding, in the {{announcement}} of the new magazine. He argued that [...] "it has been the quality of the fantasy that you have read in the past that has made the very word anathema ... will offer fantasy of a quality so far different from that which has appeared in the past as <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> entire understanding of the term". The first issue, the following month, led with Russell's Sinister Barrier, the novel that had persuaded Campbell to set his plans for a fantasy magazine into motion: the plot, involving aliens who own the human race, has been described by sf historian Mike Ashley as [...] "a strange mixture of science fiction and occult fantasy". Campbell asked Russell for revisions to the story to emphasize the fantastic elements, but still demanded that Russell work out the logical implications of his premises. This became a defining characteristic of the fiction published in Unknown; in Ashley's words, Campbell [...] "brought the science fiction rationale to fantasy". [...] The first issue also contained Horace L. Gold's [...] "Trouble with Water", a comic fantasy about a modern New Yorker who offends a water gnome; in its whimsicality and naturalistic merging of a modern background with a classic fantasy trope, [...] "Trouble with Water" [...] was a better indication than Sinister Barrier of the direction Unknown would take. [...] Campbell commented in a letter at the time that Sinister Barrier, [...] "Trouble with Water", and Where Angels Fear ... by Manly Wade Wellman were the only stories in the first issue that accurately reflected his goals for the magazine.|$|E

500|$|Of more {{importance}} to the science fiction and fantasy genres were several other magazines that debuted in 1939. [...] The first to appear, from Standard Magazines, were Startling Stories and Strange Stories, launched in January and February respectively as companions to Thrilling Wonder Stories; Mort Weisinger edited all three. [...] Startling included a lead novel and a [...] "Hall of Fame" [...] reprint section in every issue; the latter was possible because the publisher, Standard Magazines, owned the back catalog of Wonder Stories. [...] At that time no other sf pulp was including novels; readers approved, and Startling quickly {{became one of the}} most popular sf magazines. [...] Strange Stories was launched as a direct competitor to Weird Tales, and the first issue featured many of Weird Tales most popular authors, including Robert Bloch, August Derleth, Henry Kuttner and Manly Wade Wellman. Bloch, Derleth, and Kuttner were all frequent contributors over the magazine's life, but Ashley regards it as a poor imitation of Weird Tales, fewer of its stories having been anthologized since. [...] At the end of 1938 Weird Tales owner, B. Cornelius, sold his interest in the magazine to William J. Delaney, the publisher of Short Stories, a general fiction magazine. [...] Delaney's offices were in New York, and Weird Tales editor, Farnsworth Wright, moved there from Chicago. [...] Delaney made several changes to page count and frequency to try to increase circulation, but none were successful. [...] While this took place, another competitor to Weird Tales was launched, this time by Street & Smith. [...] The new magazine, titled Unknown, was a companion to Astounding and was also edited by John W. Campbell. [...] Campbell's declared policy for the magazine was to [...] "offer fantasy of a quality so far different from that which has appeared in the past as <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> entire understanding of the term"; the goal was to bring [...] "the science fiction rationale to fantasy", in Ashley's words. [...] Unknowns first issue was dated March 1939, with L. Ron Hubbard and L. Sprague de Camp soon among the most frequent contributors.|$|E

2500|$|The Seth Material {{says that}} all {{individuals}} create their own circumstances and experiences within the shared earthly environment, similar to the doctrine of responsibility assumption. This concept is expressed in the phrase [...] "you create your own reality", which may have originated with the Seth readings. The inner self, or inner ego, {{is responsible for the}} construction and maintenance of the individual's physical body and immediate physical environment, and the unfolding of events is determined by the expectations, attitudes and beliefs of the outer ego, that portion of the self that human beings know as themselves.

2500|$|Lock {{screen is}} the {{simplest}} way to prevent unauthorized access your computer. [...] Since it is standard on most computers, it costs no extra memory or financial expense, but secures your computer so securely the FBI finds it difficult to gain access, let alone ordinary people. [...] Trying to control privacy and maintain parental controls within the computer without screen lock is like leaving the exterior doors of your house unlocked or wide open, relying on small locks on cabinets, drawers, closets, interior doors, (etc.), which your teenager or other intruder can lock-pick open at leisure away from the public view. Lock screen is actually more secure than common safeguards in life, such as locking your car so your child won't have a car accident which won't do any good if the child finds your keys, or a house-key while there are windows that can be smashed or pushed open for entry. If you do discover that the lock screen is not effective, then it is a certainty that you need <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>your</b> password to something less predictable, which is easily done, far easier than re-keying a car key or changing the combination of a physical lock.|$|E
