In their book The Charter Revolution & the Court Party, Morton and Knopff express their suspicions of this alliance in detail, accusing the Trudeau and Chrétien governments of funding litigious groups. For example, these governments used the Court Challenges Program to support minority language educational rights claims.

25|$|Section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867 ("British North America Act 1867") {{gives the}} federal {{government}} exclusive jurisdiction over First Nations, and thus the exclusive ability to extinguish Aboriginal title. Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982 explicitly recognized and preserved aboriginal rights. R. v. Guerin (1982), the first Supreme Court of Canada decision handed down after the Constitution Act 1982, declared that Aboriginal title was sui generis and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> a fiduciary duty to preserve it. R. v. Simon (1985) overruled R. v. Syliboy (1929) which had held that Aboriginal peoples had no capacity to enter into treaties, and thus that the Numbered Treaties were void. A variety of non-land rights cases, anchored on the Constitution Act 1982, have also been influential.|$|E
25|$|Mark N. Franklin {{argues that}} salience, the {{perceived}} effect {{that an individual}} vote will have on how the country is run, has {{a significant effect on}} turnout. He presents Switzerland {{as an example of a}} nation with low salience. The nation's administration is highly decentralized, so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> limited powers. The government invariably consists of a coalition of parties, and the power wielded by a party is far more closely linked to its position relative to the coalition than to the number of votes it received. Important decisions are placed before the population in a referendum. Individual votes for the federal legislature are thus unlikely to have a significant effect on the nation, which probably explains the low average turnouts in that country. By contrast Malta, with one of the world's highest voter turnouts, has a single legislature that holds a near monopoly on political power. Malta has a two-party system in which a small swing in votes can completely alter the executive. On the other hand, countries with a two party system can experience low turnout if large numbers of potential voters perceive little real difference between the main parties. Voters' perceptions of fairness also have an important effect on salience. If voters feel that the result of an election is more likely to be determined by fraud and corruption than by the will of the people, fewer people will vote.|$|E

500|$|The 1988 Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act removed {{international}} trade barriers and amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, designating the metric system as [...] "the Preferred system of {{weights and measures}} for United States trade and commerce". The legislation stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> a responsibility to assist industry, especially small business, as it voluntarily converts to the metric system of measurement. Exceptions were made for the highway and construction industries; the Department of Transportation planned to require metric units by 2000, but this plan was cancelled by the 1998 highway bill TEA21. However, the US military uses the metric system widely, {{partly because of the}} need to work with armed services from other nations. Although overall responsibility for labelling requirements of consumer goods lies with Congress and is therefore covered by federal law, details of labelling requirements for certain commodities are controlled by state law or by other authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration, Environmental Protection Agency and Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.|$|E

Tasmania argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> deprived it of property unjustly by passing the World Heritage Act.

2500|$|Various {{legislative}} proposals under {{serious consideration}} propose fining larger employers {{who do not}} provide a minimum standard of healthcare insurance and mandating that people purchase private healthcare insurance. This {{is the first time}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> mandated people to buy insurance, although nearly all states in the union currently mandate the purchase of auto insurance. The legislation also taxes certain very high payout insurance policies (so-called [...] "Cadillac policies") to help finance subsidies for poorer citizens. These will be offered on a sliding scale to people earning less than four times the federal poverty level to enable them to buy health insurance if they are not otherwise covered by their employer.|$|E
2500|$|The Tenth Amendment (1791) was {{included}} in the Bill of Rights to further define the balance of power between {{the federal government and the}} states.

These powers include the power to declare war, to collect taxes, to regulate interstate business activities and others that are listed in the articles or in subsequent constitutional amendments. Any power not listed is, says the Tenth Amendment, left to the states or the people. While there is no specific list of what these [...] "reserved powers" [...] may be, the Supreme Court has ruled that laws affecting family relations, commerce within a state's own borders, and local law enforcement activities, are among those specifically reserved to the states or the people.|$|E
2500|$|In Dion's third {{open letter}} to Premier Lucien Bouchard came on 25 August 1998, shortly after the Supreme Court ruling on Secession had been handed down.

In regard to the ruling, Dion makes three claims: <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> a role in the selection of the question and the level of support required for it to pass, that secession can only be achieved through negotiation rather than a [...] "unilateral declaration of independence", and that the terms of negotiation could not be decided solely by the Government of Quebec.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the early}} 20thcentury, the {{population}} of Mexico City alone had risen to over one million people. A population explosion began early in the 20th century, with {{the population of}} the city itself doubling approximately every 15years since 1900, partly attributed to the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> favored development of the metropolitan area over other areas of the country. This has spurred investment in infrastructure for the city, such as electricity, other power sources, water supply and drainage. These have attracted businesses which in turn have attracted more population. Since the 1950s, urbanization has spread out from beyond the bounds of the Federal District to the surrounding jurisdictions, especially to the north into the State of Mexico making for the Mexico City Metropolitan area, which fills most of the valley. Today, this metropolitan area accounts for 45per cent of the country's industrial activity, 38percent of GNP, and 25percent of the population. Much of its industry is concentrated {{in the northern part of}} the Federal District and the adjoining cities in the state of Mexico. While population growth has slowed and even declined in the city proper, the outer limits of the metropolitan area keep growing. Much of this growth has occurred on the mountainsides of the valley, in the form of illegal settlements in ecologically sensitive areas. Overall urban settlement in the valley has expanded from about [...] in 1940 to [...] in 1990. The metropolitan area has about 21million residents and about 6million cars.|$|E
60|$|It happens, very {{fortunately}} for the world, that {{a century and a}} quarter ago thirteen various and very jealous states worked out the problem of a Union, and became--after an enormous, exhausting wrangle--the United States of America. Now the way they solved their riddle was by delegating and giving over jealously specified sovereign powers and doing all that was possible to retain the residuum. They remained essentially sovereign states. New York, Virginia, Massachusetts, for example, remained legally independent. The practical fusion of these peoples into one people outran the legal bargain. It was only after long years of discussion that the point was conceded; it was indeed only after the Civil War that the implications were fully established, that there resided a sovereignty in the American people as a whole, as distinguished from the peoples of the several states. This is a precedent that every one who talks about the League of Nations should bear in mind. These states set up a congress and president in Washington with strictly delegated powers. That congress and president they delegated to look after certain common interests, to deal with interstate trade, to deal with foreign powers, to maintain a supreme court of law. Everything else--education, militia, powers of life and death--the states retained for themselves. To this day, for instance, the federal courts and the federal officials have no power to interfere to protect the lives or property of aliens in any part of the union outside the district of Columbia. The state governments still see to <b>that.</b> <b>The</b> <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>has</b> the legal right perhaps to intervene, but it is still chary of such intervention. And these states of the American Union were at the outset so independent-spirited that they would not even adopt a common name. To this day they have no common name. We have to call them Americans, which is a ridiculous name when we consider that Canada, Mexico, Peru, Brazil are all of them also in America. Or else we have to call them Virginians, Californians, New Englanders, and so forth. Their legal and nominal separateness weighs nothing against the real fusion that their great league has now made possible.|$|E
