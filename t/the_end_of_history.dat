5|$|The product {{claimed to}} be the strongest beer made is Schorschbräu's 2011 Schorschbock 57 with 57,5%. It was preceded by <b>The</b> <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>History,</b> a 55% Belgian ale, made by BrewDog in 2010. The same company had {{previously}} made Sink The Bismarck!, a 41% abv IPA, and Tactical Nuclear Penguin, a 32% abv Imperial stout. Each of these beers are made using the eisbock method of fractional freezing, in which a strong ale is partially frozen and the ice is repeatedly removed, until the desired strength is reached, a process that may class the product as spirits rather than beer. The German brewery Schorschbräu's Schorschbock, a 31% abv eisbock, and Hair of the Dog's Dave, a 29% abv barley wine made in 1994, used the same fractional freezing method. A 60% abv blend of beer with whiskey was jokingly claimed as the strongest beer by a Dutch brewery in July 2010.|$|E

Réal Fillion offers a critical exposition of the theses of these three authors on the dynamics and <b>the</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> {{in order to provide}} an answer to the question: "Where are we headed?" Grounding his answer in the twin observations that the world is becoming increasingly multicultural and increasingly unified, Fillion reasserts the task of the speculative philosophy <b>of</b> <b>history</b> as it had been understood by German philosophy: the articulation and understanding the historical process as a developmental whole...|$|R

25|$|A {{great many}} - {{if not a}} {{majority}} - of critical Biblical scholars, going {{as far back as}} Albert Schweitzer, hold that Jesus believed that <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> was coming within his own lifetime or within the lifetime of his contemporaries.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> is, alas, {{also the}} end of the dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for {{disposing}} of old ideologies, old regimes, old values. Where are we going to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice here since the very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history, this is because History itself has become a dustbin. It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.|$|E

2500|$|The Apostle Paul {{also seems}} to have shared this expectation. Toward the end of 1 Corinthians 7, he counsels Christians to avoid getting married if they can since <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> was imminent. Speaking to the unmarried, he writes, [...] "I think that, {{in view of the}} {{impending}} crisis, it is well for you to remain as you are."

2500|$|Herzen was {{disillusioned with}} the Revolutions of 1848 but not disillusioned with revolutionary thought. He became {{critical}} of those 1848 revolutionaries who were [...] "so revolted by the Reaction after 1848, so exasperated by everything European, that they hastened on to Kansas or California". Herzen had always admired the French Revolution and broadly adopted its values. In his early writings, he viewed the French Revolution as <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>history,</b> {{the final stage}} in social development of a society based on humanism and harmony. Throughout his early life, Herzen saw himself as a revolutionary radical called to fight the political oppression of Nicholas I of Russia. Essentially, Herzen fought against the ruling elites in Europe, against Christian hypocrisy and for individual freedom and self-expression.|$|E
2500|$|Christianity began within Judaism, with a Christian [...] "church" [...] (or ἐκκλησία, ekklesia, meaning [...] "assembly") {{that arose}} either within Jesus' own {{lifetime}} or {{shortly after his}} death, when some of his followers claimed to have witnessed him risen from the dead. From the outset, Christians depended heavily on Jewish literature, supporting their convictions through the Jewish scriptures. Those convictions involved a nucleus of key concepts: the messiah, the son of God {{and the son of}} man, the Day of the Lord, the kingdom of God. Uniting these ideas was the common thread of apocalyptic expectation: Both Jews and Christians believed that <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>history</b> was at hand, that God would very soon come to punish their enemies and establish his own rule, and that they were at the centre of his plans. Christians read the Jewish scripture as a figure or type of Jesus Christ, so that the goal of Christian literature became an experience of the living Christ. The new movement spread around the eastern Mediterranean and to Rome and further west, and assumed a distinct identity, although the groups within it remained extremely diverse.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} The Shape of the Signifier: 1967 to <b>the</b> <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>History,</b> Walter Benn Michaels {{considers}} the deeper theoretical implications of Stephenson's book. Comparing {{the book with}} a range of contemporary writers—the fiction of Bret Easton Ellis, Kathy Acker, Octavia Butler, and even Paul de Man and the literary criticism of Richard Rorty—Michaels criticizes the deep claims of Stephenson's book: [...] "And yet, in Snow Crash, the bodies of humans are affected by [...] "information" [...] they can't read; the virus, like the icepick , gets the words inside you even if you haven't read them." [...] Michaels especially targets Stephenson's view that [...] "languages are codes" [...] rather than a grouping of letters and sounds to be interpreted. Michaels further contends that this basic idea of language as code ("... a good deal of Snow Crashs plot depends upon eliding the distinction between hackers and their computers, as if—indeed, in the novel, just because—looking at code will do to the hacker what receiving it will do to the computer") aligns Stephenson, along with other writers mentioned, with a racially motivated view of culture: that culture is something transmitted and stored by blood (or genetic codes), and not by beliefs and practices. According to critic Walter Benn Michaels: ...|$|E
