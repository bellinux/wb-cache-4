5|$|Addition {{of boron}} nitride to silicon nitride {{ceramics}} improves the <b>thermal</b> <b>shock</b> {{resistance of the}} resulting material. For the same purpose, BN is added also to silicon nitride-alumina and titanium nitride-alumina ceramics. Other materials being reinforced with BN include alumina and zirconia, borosilicate glasses, glass ceramics, enamels, and composite ceramics with titanium boride-boron nitride, titanium boride-aluminium nitride-boron nitride, and silicon carbide-boron nitride composition.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{has long}} been used in {{high-temperature}} applications. In particular, it was identified {{as one of the}} few monolithic ceramic materials capable of surviving the severe <b>thermal</b> <b>shock</b> and thermal gradients generated in hydrogen/oxygen rocket engines. To demonstrate this capability in a complex configuration, NASA scientists used advanced rapid prototyping technology to fabricate a one-inch-diameter, single-piece combustion chamber/nozzle (thruster) component. The thruster was hot-fire tested with hydrogen/oxygen propellant and survived five cycles including a 5-minute cycle to a 1320°C material temperature.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} material properties for the dies are <b>thermal</b> <b>shock</b> resistance and softening at elevated temperature; other important properties include hardenability, machinability, heat checking resistance, weldability, availability (especially for larger dies), and cost. The longevity of a die is directly {{dependent on the}} temperature of the molten metal and the cycle time. The dies used in die casting are usually made out of hardened tool steels, because cast iron cannot withstand the high pressures involved, therefore the dies are very expensive, resulting in high start-up costs. Metals that are cast at higher temperatures require dies made from higher alloy steels.|$|E

5|$|Boron is {{primarily}} used in chemical compounds. About {{half of all}} boron consumed globally is an additive in fiberglass for insulation and structural materials. The next leading use is in polymers and ceramics in high-strength, lightweight structural and refractory materials. Borosilicate glass is desired for its greater strength and <b>thermal</b> <b>shock</b> resistance than ordinary soda lime glass. Boron compounds are used as fertilizers in agriculture and in sodium perborate bleaches. A small amount of boron {{is used as a}} dopant in semiconductors, and reagent intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} research of multilayer aluminium–silicon coatings. Aluminium–silicon coatings were created on high–temperature creep resist cast iron using slurry method in air atmosphere. These coatings protect equipment against hot corrosionin carburizing atmosphere at <b>thermal</b> <b>shocks</b> conditions. Various technological parameters of coatings manufacturing were applied. Main technological parameters were: temperature and time ofannealing and Al-Si ratio {{in the active}} mixture. The structure of obtained coatings is three-zonal. Phase composition of two external zones ensures protection against carburizing, but these zones are not resistant to cracking. The cracks form {{as a result of}} <b>thermal</b> <b>shocks.</b> The internal zone of the coatings situated next to substrate compensates for differences of thermal expansion of the coating and the substrate. The cracks are stopped in the internal zone and do not propagate into the substrate material. Protective efficiency of the coatings at carburizing conditions with <b>thermal</b> <b>shocks</b> was determined. Structure of the coatings before and after carburizing and <b>thermal</b> <b>shocks</b> is described in present paper. Thickness, chemical composition (EDS) and phase composition (XRD) of the coatings are determined. Correlation between the coatings structure and depth of carburized layer was determined...|$|R

As a result of this finding, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered the servo valves to be replaced and new training protocol for pilots to handle unexpected movement of flight controls to be developed.

25|$|The term mainly {{refers to}} a mix of lithium and aluminosilicates that yields an array of {{materials}} with interesting thermomechanical properties.

The negative thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) of the crystalline ceramic phase can be balanced with the positive CTE of the glassy phase. At a certain point (~70% crystalline) the glass-ceramic has a net CTE near zero. This type of glass-ceramic exhibits excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000°C.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of research on aluminide protective coatings manufactured on high–temperature creep resistant cast steel. The main purpose of these coatings is protection against the high temperature corrosion, especially at high carburizing potential atmosphere. Coatings were obtained on cast steel type G–XNiCrSi 36 – 18 with the following methods: pack cementation, paste method, cast method and slurry cementation. The phase composition, thickness and morphology of coatings were determined. Coatings capacity of carbon diffusion inhibition and <b>thermal</b> <b>shocks</b> resistance of coatings were determined with different methods.

25|$|In {{a nuclear}} power station, the {{pressurized}} steam is fed through a steam turbine which drives an electrical generator connected to the electric grid for transmission. After passing through the turbine the secondary coolant (water-steam mixture) is cooled down and condensed in a condenser. The condenser converts the steam to a liquid {{so that it can}} be pumped back into the steam generator, and maintains a vacuum at the turbine outlet so that the pressure drop across the turbine, and hence the energy extracted from the steam, is maximized. Before being fed into the steam generator, the condensed steam (referred to as feedwater) is sometimes preheated in order to minimize <b>thermal</b> <b>shock.</b>|$|E
25|$|The use of {{live steam}} and exhaust steam {{injectors}} also assists in the pre-heating of boiler feedwater {{to a small}} degree, {{though there is no}} efficiency advantage to live steam injectors. Such pre-heating also reduces the <b>thermal</b> <b>shock</b> that a boiler might experience when cold water is introduced directly. This is further helped by the top feed, where water is introduced to the highest part of the boiler and made to trickle over a series of trays. G.J. Churchward fitted this arrangement to the high end of his domeless coned boilers. Other British lines such as the LBSCR fitted some locomotives with the top feed inside a separate dome forward of the main one.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the material damaging process due to low-cycle fatigue and subsequent crack growth under <b>thermal</b> <b>shocks</b> and high pressure. Finite Element Method (FEM) model of a high pressure (HP) by-pass valve body and a steam turbine rotor shaft (used in a coal power plant) is presented. The main damaging factor in both cases is fatigue due to cycles of rapid temperature changes. The crack initiation, occurring at a relatively low number of load cycles, depends on alternating or alternating-incremental changes in plastic strains. The crack propagation is determined by the classic fracture mechanics, based on finite element models and the most dangerous case of brittle fracture. This example shows the adaptation of the structure to work in the ultimate conditions of high pressure, <b>thermal</b> <b>shocks</b> and cracking...|$|R

40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>shocks</b> induce {{changes in}} the nuclear phenotypes that {{correspond}} to survival (heterochromatin decondensation, nuclear fusion) or death (apoptosis, necrosis) responses in the Malpighian tubules of Panstrongylus megistus. Since thermal tolerance increased survival and molting rate in this species following sequential shocks, we investigated whether changes in nuclear phenotypes accompanied the insect survival response to sequential <b>thermal</b> <b>shocks.</b> Fifth instar nymphs were subjected to a single heat (35 or 40 °C, 1 h) or cold (5 or 0 °C, 1 h) shock and then subjected to a second shock for 12 h at 40 or 0 °C, respectively, after 8, 18, 24 and 72 h at 28 °C (control temperature). As with specimen survival, sequential heat and cold shocks induced changes in frequency of the mentioned nuclear phenotypes although their patterns differed. The heat shock tolerance involved decrease in apoptosis simultaneous to increase in cell survival responses. Sequential cold shocks did not involve cell/nuclear fusion and even elicited increase in necrosis with advancing time after shocks. The temperatures of 40 and 0 ºC were {{more effective than the}} temperatures of 35 and 5 ºC in eliciting the heat and cold shock tolerances, respectively, as shown by cytological analysis of the nuclear phenotypes. It is concluded that different sequential <b>thermal</b> <b>shocks</b> can trigger different mechanisms of cellular protection against stress in P. megistus, favoring the insect to adapt to various ecotopes...|$|R
25|$|Sodium {{borosilicate}} glass, Pyrex: silica + boron trioxide (B2O3) + soda (Na2O) + alumina (Al2O3). Stands {{heat expansion}} {{much better than}} window glass. Used for chemical glassware, cooking glass, car head lamps, etc. Borosilicate glasses (e.g. Pyrex, Duran) have as main constituents silica and boron trioxide. They have fairly low coefficients of thermal expansion (7740 Pyrex CTE is 3.25/°C as compared to about 9/°C for a typical soda-lime glass), making them more dimensionally stable. The lower {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) also makes them less subject to stress caused by thermal expansion, thus less vulnerable to cracking from <b>thermal</b> <b>shock.</b> They are commonly used for reagent bottles, optical components and household cookware.|$|E
25|$|After carbon, {{nitrogen}} {{is arguably}} the most important element needed for life. Thus, measurements of nitrate over the range of 0.1% to 5% are required to address the question of its occurrence and distribution. There is nitrogen (as N2) in the atmosphere at low levels, but this is not adequate to support nitrogen fixation for biological incorporation. Nitrogen in the form of nitrate could be a resource for human exploration both as a nutrient for plant growth and for use in chemical processes. On Earth, nitrates correlate with perchlorates in desert environments, and this may also be true on Mars. Nitrate is expected to be stable on Mars and to have formed by <b>thermal</b> <b>shock</b> from impact or volcanic plume lightning on ancient Mars.|$|E
25|$|This {{equation}} {{shows that}} in order to achieve sufficient current density it is necessary to heat the emitter, taking care not to cause damage by application of excessive heat. For this reason materials with either a high melting point, such as tungsten, or those with a low work function (LaB6) are required for the gun filament. Furthermore, both lanthanum hexaboride and tungsten thermionic sources must be heated in order to achieve thermionic emission, this can be achieved by the use of a small resistive strip. To prevent <b>thermal</b> <b>shock,</b> there is often a delay enforced in the application of current to the tip, to prevent thermal gradients from damaging the filament, the delay is usually a few seconds for LaB6, and significantly lower for tungsten.|$|E

25|$|The Romans used {{hydraulic}} mining methods {{on a large}} scale to prospect for the veins of ore, especially a now-obsolete form of mining known as hushing. They built numerous aqueducts to supply water to the minehead. There, the water stored in large reservoirs and tanks. When a full tank was opened, the flood of water sluiced away the overburden to expose the bedrock underneath and any gold veins. The rock was then worked upon by fire-setting to heat the rock, which would be quenched with a stream of water. The resulting <b>thermal</b> <b>shock</b> cracked the rock, enabling it to be removed by further streams of water from the overhead tanks. The Roman miners used similar methods to work cassiterite deposits in Cornwall and lead ore in the Pennines.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{greatest}} operational problems with an evaporator is the build-up of scale. Its design is tailored to reduce this, and to make its cleaning as effective as possible. The usual design, as developed by Weir and the Admiralty, is for a vertical cylindrical drum, heated by steam-carrying drowned coils in the lower portion. As they are entirely submerged, they avoid the most active region for the deposition of scale, around the waterline. Each coil consists {{of one or two}} spirals in a flat plane. Each coil is easily removed for cleaning, being fastened by individual pipe unions through the side of the evaporator. A large door is also provided, allowing the coils to be removed or replaced. Cleaning may be carried out mechanically, with a manual scaling hammer. This also has a risk of mechanical damage to the tubes, as the slightest pitting tends to act as a nucleus for scale or corrosion. It is also common practice to break light scaling free by <b>thermal</b> <b>shock,</b> by passing steam through the coils without cooling water present or by heating the coils, then introducing cold seawater. In 1957 the trials ship , an obsolete heavy cruiser, was used for the first tests of the 'flexing element' distiller, where non-rigid heating coils flexed continually in service and so broke the scale free as soon as it formed a stiff layer.|$|E
