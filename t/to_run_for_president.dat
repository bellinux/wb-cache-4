5|$|Sometime between 1888 and 1890, McKinley decided <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president,</b> {{but to have}} a {{realistic}} chance of attaining that goal, he needed to regain office. Foraker's ambition then was the Senate—he planned to challenge Sherman in the legislative election {{to be held in}} January 1892—and he agreed to nominate McKinley for governor at the state convention in Columbus. McKinley was elected, and Sherman narrowly turned back Foraker's challenge with considerable help from Hanna.|$|E

Richard Emmons, from Great Crossing, Kentucky, followed this up with a play entitled Tecumseh, of the Battle of the Thames and a poem in honor of Johnson. Many of Johnson's friends and supporters – Davy Crockett and John Bell among them – encouraged him <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president.</b> Jackson, however, supported Vice-President Van Buren for the office. Johnson accepted this choice, and worked to gain the nomination for vice-president.|$|E

After campaigning for less than nine months, Kufuor polled 39.62% of the popular votes to Rawlings' 57% in the 1996 election. On 23 October 1998 he was re-nominated by the New Patriotic Party not only <b>to</b> <b>run</b> again <b>for</b> <b>President</b> but also to officially assume the position of Leader of the Party.|$|R

5|$|After the election, Paul was speculated <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president</b> in 1992 but opted {{instead to}} work on the {{campaign}} for Pat Buchanan. That year, Marrou received the Libertarian presidential nomination. Paul later returned to the Republican Party and was re-elected to his seat in Congress in 1996, without much support from establishment Republicans, who supported the party-switching Democratic incumbent of the seat. Back in Congress, Paul regained his nickname of Dr. No, favoring a free market and advocating a reduction {{in the size of the}} federal government. He was drafted to challenge President George W. Bush in the 2004 Republican primaries, but chose not to run. He ran for president again in 2008 and 2012 as a Republican, attracting a large amount of grassroots support.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1967, Nixon {{told his}} family he planned <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president</b> a second time. Although Pat Nixon did not always enjoy public life (for example, she had been embarrassed {{by the need to}} reveal how little the family owned in the Checkers speech), she was {{supportive}} of her husband's ambitions. Nixon believed that with the Democrats torn over the issue of the Vietnam War, a Republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Menem met Admiral Eduardo Massera, who {{intended}} <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president,</b> and had {{public meetings}} with personalities such as Carlos Monzón, Susana Giménez, and Alberto Olmedo. As a result, {{he was forced}} to reside in another city, Tandil. He had to report daily to Chief of Police Hugo Zamora. This forced residence was lifted in February 1980. He returned to Buenos Aires, and then to La Rioja. He resumed his political activities, despite the prohibition, and was detained again. His new forced residence was in Las Lomitas, in Formosa Province. He {{was one of the last}} politicians to be released from prison by the National Reorganization Process.|$|E

5|$|The Federal Peronism {{organized}} primary {{elections for}} the 2011 presidential elections between Duhalde and governor Alberto Rodríguez Saá, which would be held before the mandatory primary elections. Governors Felipe Solá and Mario Das Neves withdrew their candidacies. Duhalde withdrew his candidacy {{near the end of}} the primary elections. As the sole candidate, Rodríguez Saá ran for Federal Peronism, which allied with other provincial parties into the Federal Commitment coalition. Duhalde ran for president as well, on the Unión Popular ticket. He received nearly 6% of the vote in the main elections, a large difference from the number of votes cast for the main candidates, and Hilda Duhalde was not reelected as senator. In 2017 he announced that he intends <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president</b> of the PJ.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} {{was a critical}} event in both candidates' political careers, with Warren becoming a political icon after entering the Senate, and being drafted <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>President</b> in 2016. After the election loss, Brown was considered the most prominent Republican in Massachusetts and heavily favored {{to run in the}} Senate special election the following year or for Governor in 2014, though he declined to do either. He instead moved to New Hampshire and ran for the Senate there in 2014 against Democratic incumbent Jeanne Shaheen. He lost, 51% to 48%, becoming the first man to lose two Senate races to women.|$|E
5|$|According to his biographer, John M. Taylor, Seward {{picked a}} good time to absent himself from electoral politics, as the Whig Party was in turmoil. President Tyler, a former Democrat, and Senator Clay each claimed {{leadership}} of the Whig Party and, as the two men differed over such issues as whether to re-establish the Bank of the United States, party support was divided. The abolitionist movement attracted those {{who did not want to}} be part of a party led by slavery-supporting southerners. In 1844, Seward was asked <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president</b> by members of the Liberty Party; he declined and reluctantly supported the Whig nominee, Clay. The Kentuckian was defeated by Democrat James K. Polk. The major event of Polk's administration was the Mexican–American War; Seward did not support this, feeling that the price in blood was not worth the increase in territory, especially as southerners were promoting this acquisition to expand territory for slavery.|$|E
50|$|Hrynov {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> the <b>President</b> of Ukraine {{position in}} the ahead-of-schedule presidential elections of 1994, but he withdrew in favor of Leonid Kuchma, who was elected President. Hrynov was appointed as an advisor to the President.|$|R
25|$|In 2003, Legarda left Lakas-CMD (after Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo {{broke her}} pledge not <b>to</b> <b>run</b> again <b>for</b> <b>president)</b> {{and joined the}} Koalisyon ng Nagkakaisang Pilipino {{coalition}} of Fernando Poe, Jr. as an Independent during the 2004 elections.|$|R
50|$|After {{the initial}} {{objections}} of her daughters, Robredo decided <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> Vice <b>President,</b> accepting the offers of President Aquino and Mar Roxas. She officially announced her candidacy {{for the office}} on October 5, 2015, at the Club Filipino.|$|R
5|$|McGovern did not mourn {{leaving the}} Senate. Although being {{rejected}} {{by his own}} state stung, intellectually he could accept that South Dakotans wanted a more conservative representative; he and Eleanor felt {{out of touch with}} the country and in some ways liberated by the loss. Nevertheless, he refused to believe that American liberalism was dead in the time of Reagan; remaining active in politics, in January 1981 he founded the political organization Americans for Common Sense. The group sought to rally liberals, encourage liberal thinking, and combat the Moral Majority and other new Christian right forces. In 1982, he turned the group into a political action committee, which raised $1.2 million for liberal candidates in the 1982 U.S. Congressional elections. McGovern shut the committee down when he decided <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president</b> again.|$|E
5|$|The Nixon family {{traveled}} to Europe in 1963, where Nixon gave press conferences {{and met with}} leaders of the countries he visited. The family moved to New York City, where Nixon became a senior partner in the leading law firm Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie & Alexander. Nixon had pledged, when announcing his California campaign, not <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president</b> in 1964; {{even if he had}} not, he believed {{it would be difficult to}} defeat Kennedy, or after his assassination, Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson. In 1964, he supported Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater for the Republican nomination for president; when Goldwater was successful in gaining the nomination, Nixon was selected to introduce the candidate to the convention. Although he thought Goldwater unlikely to win, Nixon campaigned for him loyally. The election was a disaster for the Republicans; Goldwater's landslide loss to Johnson was matched by heavy losses for the party in Congress and among state governors.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the ARF {{announced}} that it would nominate its own candidate <b>to</b> <b>run</b> <b>for</b> <b>president</b> of Armenia in the February 2008 presidential election. In an innovation on November 24–25, 2007, the ARF conducted a non-binding Armenia-wide primary election. They invited the public to vote to advise the party which of two candidates, Vahan Hovhannisyan and Armen Rustamyan, they should formally nominate for president of Armenia in the subsequent official election. What characterized it as a primary instead of a standard opinion poll was that the public knew of the primary in advance, all eligible voters were invited, and the voting was by secret ballot. Nearly 300,000 people voted in makeshift tents and mobile ballot boxes. Vahan Hovhannisyan received the most votes and was subsequently nominated for the presidential election by the ARF Supreme Council in a secret ballot. In the presidential election, Hovhannisyan placed fourth with 6.2% of the vote. In 2008, ARF re-joined the ruling political coalition in Armenia and supported strong police actions during the 2008 Armenian presidential election protests that led to ten deaths.|$|E

Finally, she <b>ran</b> <b>for</b> vice <b>president</b> under Macri in 2015.|$|R
