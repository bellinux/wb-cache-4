[...] The first Rambo apple tree may have been produced from one of these seeds. William Coxe's A View of the Cultivation of Fruit Trees, and the Management of Orchards and Cider, published in 1817 indicates that the Rambo was much cultivated in Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey and took [...] "its name from the families by whom it was introduced into notice." [...] The Rambo is confused with but is not closely related to the french Summer Rambo. Because of the confusion, the Rambo has also been called the Winter Rambo.|$|R

Among the breeders’ clone collection, both homonymous and synonymous mislabeling were identified in addition to trees with unique genotypes. This implicates pre-planting labeling errors and rootstocks overtaking budded scions. Parentage analysis supported the Amelonado ancestry of farmers’ varieties but with significant contribution of Upper Amazon introductions. Parentage of recently developed clones and of progenies of controlled crosses showed evidence of both pollen contamination and effects of mislabeled parents. The observed patterns of unexpected parentage had direct effects on the consistency of the variety performance between trials and increased within-plot variability for families with mixed ancestry.

40|$|Cocoa {{has been}} useful in several ways, {{especially}} to countries that produce it and consumers {{all over the}} world. Its benefits range from improving economies to satisfying millions {{all over the world}} who desire one cocoa product or the other. The production of cocoa however is not without its own attendant problems. Aging tree stock, spread of diseases, and production capacity problems are, but a few of many challenges that <b>seed</b> <b>gardens</b> that produce cocoa face. This study investigated the pollination process on selected <b>seed</b> <b>gardens</b> in Ghana, the second largest world producer of cocoa. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the artificial pollination process of cocoa on <b>seed</b> <b>gardens</b> in Ghana, and explore ways by which the Lean principle of Value Stream Mapping could be applied in improving the process. The process of pollination was observed on eighteen <b>seed</b> <b>gardens,</b> and a current value stream map depicting the existing process developed to give an indication of the current state of affairs. Subsequently, a future value stream map based on the current map was developed to show aspects of the process that could be improved to enhance the operations of the <b>seed</b> <b>gardens.</b> The future value stream map revealed that operational procedures relating to cleaning and preparation of trees, choosing male and female trees for pollination, harvesting of pollen, and manually pollinating practices presented various avenues for improving the pollination process and hence seed production output...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change may}} {{increase}} the occurrence of droughts and fires in the Amazon. Most of our understanding on how fire affects tropical ecosystems is based on studies of non-flooded forest–savanna ecotones. Nonetheless, tropical floodplain forests in the Amazon can burn severely during extreme droughts. The mechanisms slowing down forest regeneration in these ecosystems remain poorly understood and have never been assessed in the field. We studied the recovery of Amazonian blackwater floodplain forests after one and two fire events. We used Landsat images to map fire history and conducted field surveys to measure forest structure, tree species richness, <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> bank and post-fire invasion of herbaceous plants. Sites burnt once had on average 0 % trees, 6 % <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> abundance, 23 % <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> species richness and 8 % root mat thickness compared to unburnt forests. In contrast, herbaceous cover increased from 0 to 72 %. Nonetheless, forest structure and diversity recovered slowly towards pre-burn levels, except for <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> banks that remained depleted even 15 years after fire. Sites burnt twice had on average 0 % trees, 1 % <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> abundance, 3 % <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> species richness and 1 % root mat thickness compared to unburnt forests. Herbaceous cover increased to 100 %. Mean recovery of tree basal area was 50 % slower and of root mat thickness 93 % slower compared to recovery in sites burnt once. <b>Tree</b> <b>seed</b> banks did not recover at all, and herbaceous cover persisted close to 100 % for more than 20 years after the second fire. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that after a second fire event, Amazonian blackwater floodplain forests lose their recovery capacity, and persist in a non-forested state dominated by herbaceous vegetation. Such fragility implies that preventing human ignited fires during drought episodes is a particularly important conservation strategy for these ecosystems. </p...|$|R

Thus, we studied the imbibition and desiccation kinetics and adsorption/ desorption isotherms of drumstick <b>tree</b> <b>seeds.</b> Seeds absorbed water readily when imbibed at 23 ºC. After 17 h of exposure to an atmosphere of 100 % relative humidity (RH), seed moisture content increased from 10 to 150 % on a dry weight basis (dwb). Seeds lost water rapidly in a 1 % RH still-air environment, and returned to their original seed moisture content in 24 h, indicating seed covering tissues are highly permeable to water. Adsorption and desorption equilibrium moisture content curves at 25 ºC were determined using the dynamic gravimetric method. Drumstick <b>tree</b> <b>seeds</b> equilibrated at relatively low moisture contents over all humidities, remaining below 10 % (dwb) at RH levels below 80 %. Five equations that are used to model seed moisture content as a function of RH were fit to the data using a non-linear regression method (modified Henderson, modified Chung-Pfost, modified Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer, modified Halsey, and D’Arcy-Watt). The D’Arcy-Watt model resulted in the best fit for predicting the seed moisture content of drumstick <b>tree</b> <b>seeds.</b> In humid environments, drying seeds before long-term storage may increase the longevity of stored drumstick <b>tree</b> <b>seeds...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Recently, human {{cases of}} nephropathia epidemica (NE) due to Puumala virus {{infection}} in Europe have increased. Following {{the hypothesis that}} high reservoir host abundance induces higher transmission rates to humans, explanations for this altered epidemiology must be sought in factors that cause bank vole (Myodes glareolus) abundance peaks. In Western Europe, these abundance peaks are often related to high <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> production, which is supposedly triggered by specific weather conditions. We evaluated the relationship between <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> production, climate and NE incidence in Belgium and show that NE epidemics are indeed preceded by abundant <b>tree</b> <b>seed</b> production. Moreover, a direct link between climate and NE incidence is found. High summer and autumn temperatures, 2 years and 1 year respectively before NE occurrence, relate to high NE incidence. This enables early forecasting of NE outbreaks. Since future climate change scenarios predict higher temperatures in Europe, we should regard Puumala virus as an increasing health threat...|$|R
