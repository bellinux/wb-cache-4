40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{computational}} aspects related to <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>realizations</b> <b>of</b> polynomial chaos expansion in high dimension. The method proposed consists <b>of</b> (1) constructing <b>the</b> <b>realizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multivariate monomials using a generator <b>of</b> independent <b>realizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> germs whose probability distribution is the given arbitrary measure and (2) performing an orthogonalization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>realizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multivariate monomials with an algorithm {{different from the}} Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization algorithm which is not stable in high dimension. A brief review of polynomial chaos expansion with arbitrary measure is given. <b>The</b> statistically independent <b>realizations</b> <b>of</b> multivariate monomials are introduced. The centered statistically independent <b>realizations</b> <b>of</b> orthonormal multivariate polynomials are developed.

5|$|Dishonored 2 was {{released}} {{to a positive}} reception.

Criticism was directed at the lack of focus of the overarching narrative. Aside from this, technical blunders as well as issues with the PC version were received unfavorably. Dishonored 2 won the award for Best Action/Adventure Game at The Game Awards 2016 and for Costume Design at the 2017 NAVGTR Awards.|$|E

In an April 2006 radio interview, he confirmed that the band was in preparation over recording a new studio album, noting that the music would cover new territory for the Daddies, drawing heavily on tropical themes. This was followed shortly thereafter by the band's first U.S. tour since 2000, where much of this new material was debuted.|$|E
5|$|Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd list {{four main}} methods of {{creating}} machinima.

Although simple to produce, AI-dependent results are unpredictable, thus complicating <b>the</b> <b>realization</b> <b>of</b> a preconceived film script. For example, when Rooster Teeth produced The Strangerhood using The Sims 2, a game that encourages the use of its AI, the group had to create multiple instances of each character to accommodate different moods. Individual instances were selected at different times to produce appropriate actions.|$|E

Dhumavati also represents yogic sleep (Yoganidra), the pre-creation state of consciousness, {{as well as the}} primal sleep (the Void) in which all creation would dissolve and reach ultimate reality of Brahman. This void is pure consciousness, the cessation of movements of the mind, and silence. Even Dhumavati's ability to spread disease is also considered positive, as disease punishes the wicked and restores cosmic order. Dhumavati is also associated with the heart or middle region of the body.|$|E
