40|$|The thesis debates one of {{the modes}} of succession, namely {{testamentary}} succession. A testament is, in accordance with Law No. 89 / 2012 of the Civil Code, {{one of the}} dispositions mortis causa. Inheritance contract and testamentary clause on legacy, along with testament, belong among dispositions mortis causa {{according to the law}} cited. The deceased exercises his or her will through such. The target of this work is to describe the current form of testamentary succession in its effective rule, focusing on facultative elements of a testament. The work is divided into six chapters. The opening chapter contains a discussion on succession rights, first in general and then the requirements of the creation of succession rights follow, {{as well as the other}} inheritance titles in their effective rule. The second chapter defines a brief excursion into the Roman law. In the subchapters, individual testament forms in the Roman law, testamentary competence, succession against testament, revocation and nullity of testament are included. The third chapter deals with testamentary succession itself; it is divided into eight subchapters. The first subchapter defines the term of testament. The following two subchapters deal with legal competence and the effects of error. <b>The</b> <b>testament</b> <b>form</b> is defined in the fourth subchapter. In [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Literary {{imitations of}} <b>the</b> <b>testament</b> <b>form</b> have a European {{tradition}} {{going back to}} classical times and constitute a neglected part of English literature. Although examples appear from the 14 th century onwards, no thorough study of last wills and testaments as a specific form of English literature has been undertaken. This neglect may be because, within the broad field of the literary idea of 'legacy', parodies of <b>the</b> <b>testament</b> <b>form</b> ('mock testaments') and serious imitations ('lovers' testaments' etc.) appear in nearly every genre as either single texts or parts of larger ones, themselves crossing the genre boundaries. Then too, {{a large number of}} literary testaments come under the heading of 'minor literature', such as shortlived pamphlets and broadsides. Yet the use which major authors like Shakespeare and Donne made of the literary testament shows that it had become an established form in the 16 th century. The texts under examination here would normally be referred to as courtly love poems, political pamphlets, jests, cook-books, nursery rhymes, epic poems, autobiographical verse (Chatterton's Will), modern poems (yeats, Auden and McNeice) or as parts of masques, plays or novels. The aim is to show that one can legitimately speak of all these texts as belonging to a single literary category. In addition to adescription {{of the history of the}} literary testament in England, the central problem of this study was one of generic form. The attempt has been made to apply recent ideas of genre theory, i. e., the structuralist generative approach, to texts imitating a non-literary or utility document. This non-literary model is narrowly defined by criteria set by the Church and the Law. Thus it becomes possible to proceed as if the model were the generic norm of a corpus of greatly varying literary texts, thereby avoiding the problems of defming and re-defming selective principles (and of the need to assume a hypothetical 'first form') for the gathering of texts. The testament is a private re cord especially weil suited for studies of this kind because of its traditional fixed form and wide popularization from the Middle Ages onwards. In its complexity, the testament allows for more variation of style, content and purpose than does the letter, but is more disciplined in its form. In categorizing the testaments as such, it is necessary to study contemporary connotations and to defme the basic structure of the model. A selection of genuine, nonficticious testaments drawn up by members of the University of Cambridge in the 16 th century has been examined for this purpose. (The 16 th and 17 th centuries can be taken as the most productive of literary testament writing.) There seems to exist a dichotomy in the testament itself; on the one hand there are mundane considerations (bequeathing of property) and on the other thoughts directed towards the life to come. Ihis dichotomy is observable not only on the content level, but also on the formal level and the semantic level. Ihe relation between the two testamentary elements, which is characterized by polarization, can be postulated as the basic structure of the testament and as the genre norm of the literary texts examined here. Taking into account the fact that the testament has been of varying importance in various ages, a wide selection of literary imitations of the testament from Chaucer to Yeats and after is studied in detail. A distinction may be drawn between mock testaments and serious imitations, with the former representing rebellion against the exalted authorities behind the testament. When the theoretical rebellion coincides with the practical function of satire or attack in a particular case, then the mock testament is raised to a true literary form. The serious imitation, on the other hand, makes use of the metaphysical element of the testament, and is directed to a worldly being or to the 'human condition' (as in examples drawn from the modern poets). Its problems and aim assign this study to the wider fjeld of genre research, particularly research into the relationship between genuine documents (utility texts) and their literary imitations...|$|E

A fourth group are the illustrations of the canticles and the akathist. Some psalms have no corresponding illustrations, while others have more than one. The quality of the miniatures lies more in their colouring than in their composition. By their iconography and style, they are related to paintings in Serbian churches created after 1350 during a period {{when there was no}} central, dominant art school in Serbia. This phase of Serbian art began during the reign of Serbian Emperor Stefan Uroš IV Dušan (r. 1331-1355). The miniatures show characteristics of various local schools, the most dominant of which are the school of the Matejče Monastery and the school of Metropolitan Jovan Zograf, both of which originated in the region of Skopje in northern Macedonia. The miniatures are the collective work of a group of painters belonging to those different schools.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{through the}} process of {{narrative}} and literary criticism, scholars have begun suggesting that satire is present in specific texts of <b>the</b> Old <b>Testament.</b> Thus <b>the</b> primary function of this thesis is to analyse the validity of these arguments alongside suggesting different places where satire may be found. To achieve this goal, the thesis begins by analysing and defining satire as a concept. A clear definition provides the thesis with the method needed to identify satire in texts which predate any defined understanding of the concept. The thesis also uses satirical works from throughout history as templates for understanding similar types of satire within the biblical works. 	 Once this methodology has been established, different genres of <b>the</b> Old <b>Testament</b> <b>form</b> <b>the</b> different chapters of the thesis. It identifies four different places where satire is deployed. Thus it examines satire in narratives, the book of Jonah, prophetic texts and wisdom literature. Each chapter combines new ideas with the analysis of previous scholastic arguments concerning the presence of satire. Within each genre a different type of satire with a range of complexity is deployed. The idol critiques in prophetic texts show simplistic satire. Narrative satire shows both situational and character-based satire. The book of Jonah is an example of hypocritical satire. Finally, satire in the wisdom literature contains a range of different satirical styles. 	 The thesis concludes that satire is present within the texts of <b>the</b> Old <b>Testament.</b> This has implication to the field of satire. It affirms the existence of pre-Hellenistic satire. Alongside this, it shows that satire is a subconscious human technique, deployable even when the proponent has no defined understanding of the concept. In the field of Old Testament studies it provides an alternative reading of many familiar texts. A satirical reading provides clear insight into authorial intent as well as offering different interpretations of the texts which are examined. This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|R
