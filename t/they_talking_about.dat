[...] Yankovic then traveled from Los Angeles to Denver, Colorado in early June 2014 to ask Azalea permission to parody her song. He noted that meeting a spoof target in person is not his usual method for obtaining permission, but was necessary in this instance to meet the album deadline. The encounter was described by TMZ as an [...] "ambush" [...] as Yankovic presented the potential parody lyrics to Azalea backstage at one of her concerts. He later clarified that the meeting was much more polite and blown out of proportion by TMZ. Yankovic recorded the Azalea parody [...] "Handy" [...] that same month, and announced that the album mastering process was complete on June 12.|$|E

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{academic}} debate on whether David raped Bathsheba, this article takes {{a new approach to}} 2 Sam 11 - 12. Using narrative analysis, it reinterprets 2 Sam 11 - 12 with the Hebrew biblical definition of rape in mind.

Our conclusion questions, on the one hand, the basis upon which some scholars suggest that David raped Bathsheba.

40|$|Abstract This project examines, {{bullying}} {{in elementary}} schools of Denmark. We have developed the problem formulation: How is bullying understood in the perspective of digital bullying and how does the schools act in this field? The project analyzes how bullying is characteristic in the elementary school, by looking at two different schools: the school of Jægerspris and the school of Helsingør. How do the pupils {{as well as the}} teacher define bullying? And how are <b>they</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> it? Through our analysis we found that the school of Helsingør has a larger focus on the pupils’ community and has high values of dialogue. Through these aspects we found that the school has a focus on bullying. This is compared to the school of Jægerspris, who doesn’t problematize bullying in the same degree. The project uses theories about the understandings of bullying, social processes, the culture of classrooms and change through communication. A discussion of communication of change will be presented. The project concludes that: there are many understandings of bullying and that class culture is connected to bullying. The involvement of the pupils are essential, due to the prevention of bullying...|$|E
