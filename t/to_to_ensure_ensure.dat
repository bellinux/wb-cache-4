40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis project is <b>to</b> find out the {{strategy}} of promoting health in the local church setting, mobilizing healthy church checkup. This thesis is primarily concerned with understanding the Church as designed by God. If church matters, church health is <b>to</b> be <b>ensured.</b> <b>To</b> <b>ensure</b> a healthy church, this project tries <b>to</b> see the Church {{from the perspective of}} Biblical theology, researching the nature of the Church in connection with the Kingdom, and identifying God 2 ̆ 7 s plan with the Kingdom. As a basis of evaluation, the author sees Rev. 2 - 3 as a standard for measuring church health. The Christ John the Apostle saw at the Island is the evaluator of Church who diagnoses and prescribes the solution <b>to</b> a healthy church. The author extracts nine principles of a healthy church from the message <b>to</b> the seven churches. After study on the church in relation with the Kingdom, the thesis goes <b>to</b> the background of the questionnaire survey, explaining the WIN/GROW/SEND model in connection with WORSHIP. The result of the survey appears according <b>to</b> three categories: Korean churches, Korean American churches, and American churches, ending with the acrostic H. E. A. L. T. H. Y. C. H. U. R. C.

40|$|A {{classical}} {{result of}} Khinchin {{says that for}} almost all real numbers α, the geometric mean of the first n digits a_i(α) in the continued fraction expansion of α converges <b>to</b> a number K = 2. 6854520 [...] . (Khinchin's constant) as n →∞. On the other hand, for almost all α, the arithmetic mean of the first n continued fraction digits a_i(α) approaches infinity as n →∞. There is a sequence of refinements of the AM-GM inequality, Maclaurin's inequalities, relating the 1 /k-th powers of the k-th elementary symmetric means of n numbers for 1 ≤ k ≤ n. On the left end (when k=n) we have the geometric mean, and on the right end (k= 1) we have the arithmetic mean. We analyze what happens <b>to</b> the means of continued fraction digits of a typical real number in the limit as one moves f(n) steps away from either extreme. We prove sufficient conditions on f(n) <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> divergence when one moves f(n) {{steps away from the}} arithmetic mean and convergence when one moves f(n) steps away from the geometric mean. For typical α we conjecture the behavior for f(n) =cn, 0 <c< 1. We also study the limiting behavior of such means for quadratic irrational α, providing rigorous results, as well as numerically supported conjectures. Comment: 32 pages, 7 figures.

40|$|Magister Curationis - MCurIntroduction: The {{enrolled}} {{nurse is}} an important category of nurse in the health team. Regulation 2175 is the course leading <b>to</b> enrolment as a nurse, according <b>to</b> the South African Nursing Council, {{in terms of the}} Nursing Act 33 of 2005 as amended. This category has completed the training programme R 2176 which is a course leading <b>to</b> enrolment as an auxiliary nurse. This level of training occurs in accredited hospitals schools, however it appears, from observation and personal experience, that pupil nurses experience many problems and programme does not have high pass rates. There has been no formal investigation of this situation. The aim of this study was <b>to</b> investigate factors that promote or inhibit nursing students’ success in qualifying for entrance <b>to</b> the SANC R 2175 final examination at one of the nursing schools in the Western Cape. The objectives were (i) identify factors that promote or inhibit learning amongst the pupil nurses; and <b>to</b> (ii) determine the perceptions of educators with regard <b>to</b> factors related <b>to</b> the pupil nurses success or failure. Methods: The study used a multi-method approach. A quantitative, explorative and descriptive design was applied. Target population (N= 90), consisted of student nurses following the course leading <b>to</b> registration as an enrolled nurse (R 2175) according <b>to</b> Nursing Act No 33 of 2005. Convenience sampling was used <b>to</b> select participants <b>to</b> respond <b>to</b> a questionnaire which was used <b>to</b> collect data. In qualitative approach the target population consisted of nurse educators (N= 6). Non-probability, purposive sampling was used <b>to</b> select participants for the focus group interview. Ethics: Ethical approval <b>to</b> conduct the study was obtained from the University of Western Cape and the University of Cape Town. Informed consent was obtained from the students and from the educators prior the commencement of the study. The questionnaire was pretested <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> reliability and validity. Quantitative data was analysed {{with the help of the}} University statistician and was expressed in frequency tables and factor analysis. Qualitative data was analysed using coding <b>to</b> develop categories and themes with the help of the supervisor. Results: The results showed that academic performance by place of residence had a significant difference between the urban and rural students (x 2 (1) = 0. 014). The marital status of the student showed significant association with academic performance (x 2 (3) = 0. 021). The association between support from family and academic performance was significant (x 2 (1) = 0. 008). The focus group discussion with the nurse educators confirmed and supported some of the finding of the student survey. Recommendations: Some of the researcher’s recommendations included: a review of the recruitment and selection process; review of the curriculum; review of the value of bursary; reinstatement of the bridging programme and the implementation of preceptors in the clinical facilities...|$|R

40|$|In systems {{engineering}} circles, {{it is well}} known that requirements management capability improves the likelihood of success in the team-based development of complex multidisciplinary systems. Two key elements of this capability are an ability <b>to</b> identify and manage requirements during the early phases of the system design process. This is when errors are cheapest and easiest <b>to</b> correct. Methodologies for the team development of system-level architectures need <b>to</b> support the following activities: � Partitioning the design problem into several levels of abstraction and viewpoints suitable for concurrent development by design teams. These teams may be geographically dispersed and mobile. � Coordinated communication among design teams. � Integration of the design team efforts into a working system. � Evaluation mechanisms that provide a designer with a critical feedback on the feasibility of system architecture, and make suggestions for design concept enhancement. Throughout the development process, teams need <b>to</b> maintain a shared view of the project objectives, and at the same time, focus on specific tasks. It is the responsibility of the systems engineer <b>to</b> gather and integrate subsystems and <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> <b>ensure</b> that every project engineer is working from a consistent set of project assumptions.
