25|$|As {{a result}} of the Six-Day War in 1967, the river became the ceasefire line and both banks became militarised and {{inaccessible}} to pilgrims. After 1982, while Qasr el-Yahud was still off-limits, Israel enabled Christian baptisms at the Yardenit site further north. Following the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994 access to Al-Maghtas was restored after Prince Ghazi of Jordan, who is deeply interested in religious history, visited the area {{in the company of a}} Franciscan archaeologist who had convinced him to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> was thought to be the baptism site. When they found evidence of Roman-period habitation, this was enough to encourage de-mining and further development. Soon afterwards, there were several archaeological digs led by Dr. Mohammad Waheeb who rediscovered the ancient site in 1997. The 1990s marked the period of archaeological excavations of the site followed by primary conservation and restoration measures during the early 21st century. Jordan fully reopened al-Maghtas in 2002. This was then followed by the Israeli-run western side, known as Qasr el-Yahud, which was opened for daily visits in 2011 - the traditional Epiphany celebrations had already been allowed to take place since 1985, but only at the specific Catholic and Orthodox dates and under military supervision. In 2007, a documentary film entitled The Baptism of Jesus Christ – Uncovering Bethany Beyond the Jordan was made about the site.|$|E
2500|$|After a year's hiatus, Bale {{returned}} in 2004 to play Trevor Reznik, {{the title character}} in the psychological thriller The Machinist. Bale gained attention for his devotion to the role and for the lengths to which he went to achieve Reznik's emaciated, skeletal appearance. He went without proper rest for prolonged periods, and placed himself on a crash diet of generally coffee and apples, which reduced his weight by 63 pounds (...) {{in a matter of}} months. By the end of filming Bale weighed only 121 pounds (...) , a transformation he described as [...] "very calming mentally" [...] which drew comparisons to Robert De Niro's alternate weight-gaining regimen for his role as Jake LaMotta in the 1980 film Raging Bull. Bale claimed that he had not worked {{for a period of time}} before he was cast in the film: [...] " [...] just hadn't found scripts that I'd really been interested in. So I was really dying for something to arrive. Then when this one did, I just didn't want to put it down. I finished it and, upon the kind of revelation that you get at the end, I immediately wanted to go back and re-visit it, to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> clues I could have gotten throughout". The Machinist was a low-budget production, costing roughly US$5million to produce, and was given only a limited US release. It was well received, with the review tallying website Rotten Tomatoes reporting that 77% of the critics' reviews tallied were positive.|$|E

He had the Today Show on and he was looking at images of the first tower burning, the second tower had not yet been hit. I asked what happened and he said nobody seems to know. A small plane is the way it was described must have flown into the building. Everybody was still kind of not sure if it was an accident, on purpose or whatever and as we were standing there looking we actually saw the second plane strike the second tower, so we immediately knew that that was certainly no accident.|$|E
5000|$|In early-2017, {{following}} {{a series of}} protests by those opposed to a coal-fired plant in Krabi, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha ordered that new environmental (EIA) and health impact assessments (EHIA) be conducted for the Krabi project. He directed that the public {{must be allowed to}} have its say. [...] "A new power plant will certainly be built, but how? We have to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> is good, safe and can deal with power shortages in order to ensure power security. There must be a balance between fossil fuels and recyclable energy," [...] the prime minister said. The new assessments are expected to take at least {{two and a half years}} to complete, which means the Krabi power plant will be delayed to 2024 from its original schedule of 2019. EGAT officials insisted that a new power plant is still needed in south Thailand to meet the region's power demands, which increase by four to five percent annually.|$|E

5000|$|Derby {{entered the}} September {{international}} break with just four points from their opening four games {{and with no}} wins in their last four games in all competitions. The club's owners faced recriminations from supporters over the sale of Rob Hulse (top scorer {{over the last two}} season) on transfer deadline day leaving no time to recruit an adequate replacement, leading Executive Chairman Tom Glick to defend the club's actions, stating [...] "We presented the offer to the manager and staff and they made the judgement from a footballing standpoint that this is an offer that was right to accept. Rob has been a great contributor and we acknowledge that when a player like Rob goes there will be disappointment. But ultimately I would have them fans look at the squad Nigel has put together, take a look past the temporary injury situation and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>what</b> we have in the squad and the style of football we are playing. And I would say have some faith that Nigel has {{done a very good job}} with recruitment and the results will be coming very soon. We firmly believe that." [...] The squad was again suffering from injuries - Chris Porter (hip), Russell Anderson (groin), Stephen Pearson (knee) were all short term casualties, with Steve Davies (cruciate ligaments) and Miles Addison (foot) out for the season. In addition, Jake Buxton was fit enough only for the bench and Tomasz Cywka playing with a protective mask on after fracturing his cheekbone. Reigning Player of the Year Shaun Barker was also playing with a slight thigh strain. The club restated its intention to benefit from the loan system, saying [...] "There will be more and better players available on 7 September that were not available in the last window. That has to do Premier League's 25-man squad rule and Premier League sides holding on to guys just in case to make final decision" [...] The club revealed it had agreed a deal with West Bromwich Albion to sign Chris Wood on loan, but WBA's own injury problems forced them to pull the plug on any deal. Though Derby initially hoped to resurrect it at a later date, they instead bought in Swansea City's Shefki Kuqi on a three-month loan and Wood's West Brom teammate Luke Moore and Sunderland youngster Ryan Noble on 29 day deals. There was also interest in Leicester City's Matt Fryatt, Aston Villa's Shane Lowry and former England U18 defender Netan Sansara was taken on trial.|$|E
