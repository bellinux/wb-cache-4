Methodology is presented that exploits this superresolution phenomenon for both single aperture and interferometer observations. The treatment applies to the saturated (strong-scattering) regime and holds for both thin screens and extended media. A general signal model for radio sources is presented, scintillated amplitude modulated noise, which applies to compact, incoherent synchrotron sources such as AGNs and gamma-ray burst sources and also to known, coherent sources such as masers and pulsars. The exact probability density function for measured intensities and interferometric visibilities is obtained by solving a general Fredholm problem. An approximate density function is also obtained by using the equivalent number of degrees of freedom in scintillation modulations. The scintillation modulation variance is presented, which includes the effects of source structure and time-bandwidth averaging in the signal processing. Two Bayesian methods are outlined for inferring the sizes of emission regions that use first order statistics of the intensity and visibility. Intensity cross-correlation methods for inferring source sizes are also given. Intensity interferometry in the the radio context is compared to the optical intensity interferometry of Hanbury-Brown and Twiss. 1...|$|E
40|$|Caustic-crossing binary lenses make {{up about}} 5 % of all {{detected}} microlenses. The relative proper motion of a caustic-crossing binary lens can be measured with observations from a single <b>terrestrial</b> <b>telescope.</b> Thus, uniquely, binary lenses can be completely solved with only {{the addition of a}} measurement of the microlensing parallax. This solution will yield the mass, distance, and transverse velocity of the lens relative to the source. To date, only one of the ∼ 1000 observed microlensing events has been so solved. We examine the ability of a parallax satellite combined with ground-based observations to solve these events. To measure both components of the vector parallax, the lens must be observed near two different caustics. Thus, the final accuracy is determined mostly by whether one can intensively monitor part of the first caustic crossing, by the magnification pattern, and by the path of the source with respect to the lens geometry. We find that vector parallaxes can be measured far more easily for binary lenses than single lenses, requiring 1 - 3 orders of magnitude fewer photons. They may thus yield a large number of completely solved lenses relatively cheaply. Subject headings: gravitational lensing — stars:binaries — stars:mass function — Galaxy:bulge...|$|E

This allows to indefinitely increase the degree of correction while maintaining the first mechanical resonance at the level of a single segment, and shows an increase in price only proportional to the number of segments.

The radar observations also allowed astronomers to determine that the rotation period of Venus was 243.1 days, and that its axis of rotation was almost perpendicular to its orbital plane.

50|$|Most {{telescope}} designs {{produce an}} inverted image at the focal plane; these {{are referred to}} as inverting telescopes.

40|$|This ongoing work {{concerns}} {{the creation of}} a deformable mirror by the integration of MEMS actuators with Nanolaminate foils through metal compression boning. These mirrors will use the advantages of these disparate technologies to achieve dense actuation of a high-quality, continuous mirror surface. They will enable advanced adaptive optics systems in large <b>terrestrial</b> <b>telescopes.</b> While MEMS actuators provide very dense actuation with high precision they can not provide large forces typically necessary to deform conventional mirror surfaces. Nanolaminate foils can be fabricated with very high surface quality while their extraordinary mechanical properties enable very thin, flexible foils to survive the rigors of fabrication. Precise metal compression bonding allows the attachment of the fragile MEMS actuators to the thin nanolaminate foils without creating distortions at the bond sites. This paper will describe work in four major areas: (1) modeling and design, (2) bonding development, (3) nanolaminate foil development, (4) producing a prototype. A first-principles analytical model was created and used to determine the design parameters. A method of bonding was determined that is both strong, and minimizes the localized deformation or print through. Work has also been done to produce nanolaminate foils that are sufficiently thin, flexible and flat to be deformed by the MEMS actuators. Finally a prototype was produced by bonding thin, flexible nanolaminate foils to commercially available MEMS actuators...|$|R

40|$|The {{degradation}} of astronomical images caused by atmospheric turbulence {{will be much}} more severe in the next generation of <b>terrestrial</b> <b>telescopes</b> and its compensation will require deformable mirrors with up to tens-of-thousands of actuators. Current designs for these correctors consist of scaling up the proven technologies of flexible optical plates deformed under the out-of-plane action of linear actuators. This approach will lead to an exponential growth of cost with the number of actuators, and in very complex mechanisms. This thesis proposes a new concept of optical correction which is modular, robust, lightweight and low-cost and is based on the bimorph in-plane actuation. The adaptive mirror consists of segmented identical hexagonal bimorph mirrors allowing to indefinitely increase the degree of correction while maintaining the first mechanical resonance at the level of a single segment and showing an increase in price only proportional to the number of segments. Each bimorph segment can be mass-produced by simply screen-printing an array of thin piezoelectric patches onto a silicon wafer resulting in very compact and lightweight modules and at a price essentially independent from the number of actuators. The controlled deformation of a screen-printed bimorph mirror was experimentally achieved with meaningful optical shapes and appropriate amplitudes; its capability for compensating turbulence was evaluated numerically. The generation of continuous surfaces by an assembly of these mirrors was numerically simulated and a demonstrator of concept consisting of 3 segments was constructed.
