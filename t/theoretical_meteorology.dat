40|$|The {{periodic}} quasigeostrophic equations are a coupled {{system of}} a second order elliptic equation for a streamfunction and first order hyperbolic equations for the relative potential vorticity and surface potential temperatures, on a three-dimensional domain which is periodic in both horizontal spatial co-ordinates. Such equations are used in both numerical and <b>theoretical</b> studies in <b>meteorology</b> and oceanography. In this paper Schauder estimates and a Schauder fixed point theorem are used to prove the existence and uniqueness of strong, that is classical, solutions of the periodic quasigeostrophic equations for a finite interval of time, which is inversely proportional to {{the sum of the}} norms of the initial vorticity and surface temperatures...|$|R

Apart from {{acting as a}} strong scientific stimulus {{to the development of}} dynamical weather prediction, Professor Charney's research has led the way to a more fundamental understanding of the atmosphere's general circulation, hydrodynamical instability, the structure of hurricanes, the dynamics of ocean currents, the propagation of wave energy, and many other aspects of geophysical fluid mechanics. In its scientific depth and breadth, Professor Charney's work has contributed significantly to the study of meteorology as an exact science.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the design and {{construction}} of the meteorological station. The meteorological station is designed and constructed {{to be able to}} measure the basic meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, air pressure) and the other three variables (measuring rainfall, wind speed, wind direction). This thesis will introduce you to meteorology. Meteorology determines the daily weather forecast and the results are used for examples in aviation or maritime affairs. The method of atmospheric origin is given in the <b>theoretical</b> part. <b>Meteorology</b> must use measuring instruments to determine quantities. The dissertation also includes analysis of the measuring instruments. The meteorological station uses the Ethernet technology. In the chapter devoted to Ethernet are described its principles, types and method of power supply over Ethernet. The following section describes the design of the entire meteorological station, selection of all components and description of their connection. The chapter about implementation contains a description of the parts which forms program part of the meteorological station. The aim of the thesis is a summary of the achieved results including price comparison of the renovated meteorological station with other meteorological stations, which can be normally bought...|$|R
40|$|When I {{was invited}} to prepare a paper for this volume honoring Hans Ertel, my {{immediate}} reply was that I had retired, my laboratory was closed down, and I had no new data or unpublished ideas to report. The Editor, Wilfried Schroder, generously suggested that in a volume honoring {{the work of a}} scientist dealing with problems of global scale, it would be appropriate for me to present a statement about the activities of the seven Associations comprising the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics. Hans Enel's research spanned several fields, as indicated by his titles of Professor of Geophysics. <b>Theoretical</b> Mechanics and <b>Meteorology,</b> and Director of the Institute of Physical Hydrography. The research ranged from interactions between the ocean and atmosphere to those between the stratosphere and troposphere. His theoretical work on fluid dynamics has wide applications, and he published in addition on geodesy, inhomogeneous magnetic fields, theory of earth currents, weather forecasting, coastal problems, geomorphology arid seiches. His responsibilities as Vice-President or Director of Academies and Institutes during the 1950 s involved international cooperation and exchange of ideas with scientists all over the world. He was an editor of several geophysical and meteorological journals (German language), and has stimulated many international conferences in physics and geophysics. He {{played a significant role in}} development of IUGG's International Geophysical Year (1957 - 58), and later worked on the program of the International Hydrological Decade. The 50 th Anniversary of the International Geophysical Year will be celebrated very soon. The present interdisciplinary character of geophysical sciences was emphasized in my Presidential Address at the Opening Ceremony of the XXIl General Assembly of IUGG in Birmingham. July 1999, the text of which is reproduced below. From what I have learned of Hans Ertel and his research I feel confident that, if still living, this "seminal figure in the development of modem meteorology and geophysics" (quotation from W. Schroder) would have fitted comfortably into the 1999 General Assembly Program, with honor. ...|$|R
50|$|In 1950, {{he joined}} the newly formed {{meteorology}} department at Florida State University, where he would spend {{the remainder of his}} career and later twice served as the department chairman. Starting in 1966, he was associate dean at the University for several years. He served as head of the meteorology science team for the Viking landers, and helped design the weather instruments for the Viking 1. On July 21, 1976, he made the first ever extraterrestrial weather report, giving the atmospheric conditions at Chryse Planitia, Mars. In 1978, he received the Robert O. Lawton Distinguished Professorship, the highest honor awarded by FSU. His work titled Introduction to <b>theoretical</b> <b>meteorology</b> was published in 1959; it was reprinted in 1979. He died from complications following surgery for cancer. In 1983, the Seymour Hess Memorial Symposium was held in his honor by the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics.|$|E

40|$|A brief {{description}} is presented {{of the classical}} theory of middle-latitude atmospheric circulation, which is essentially based on the analysis of zonally averaged stationary flows and their stability properties. The structure and the statistical properties of observed circulation are discussed in some detail. Particular emphasis is placed upon the long-lasting anomalies usually associated with the meteorological phenomenon of “blocking. ” Anomalies raise several physical interpretations that may be keys to understanding the statistical properties of the atmospheric system and therefore of climate. Recent developments {{in the study of}} global properties of the phase space of simplified theoretical prototypes of atmospheric circulation are then described. Problems to be solved in the future are emphasized. Stability properties of zonally nonsymmetric circulations in the presence of global-scale topographic reliefs are discussed, showing that the solutions of some of the outstanding physical problems in the theory of atmospheric circulation may be found in the analysis of local properties of the phase space of model atmospheres. Although the recent application to meteorology of techniques of analysis of strongly nonlinear systems has produced results of extreme interest, the general conclusion is drawn that much can still be learned by means of the classical instruments of <b>theoretical</b> <b>meteorology...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn 2003, {{the author}} {{suggested}} a mathematical {{framework for the}} derivation of reduced meteorological models at a Mathematics conference (5 th ICIAM, Sydney, Australia), (Klein, 2004). The framework consists of (i) non-dimensionalization of the 3 -D compressible flow equations on the rotating sphere, (ii) identification of universal non-dimensional parameters, (iii) distinguished limits between these and additional problem-specific parameters, and (iv) multiple scales expansions in the remaining small parameter ?. This parameter may be interpreted as the cubic root of the centripetal acceleration due to the Earth's rotation divided by the acceleration of gravity, see also Keller (1951), Eq. (10). For the mojority of reduced models of <b>theoretical</b> <b>meteorology</b> that we have come across, the approach allowed us to generate systematic derivations starting directly from the 3 -D compressible flow equations on the rotating sphere. The framework's potential fully shows in multiscale interaction studies such as Klein (2006), in which we incorporated bulk microphysics closures for moist processes and derived scale interaction models for deep convection. Currently, we study the structure, evolution, and motion of Hurricane strength H 1 /H 2 vortices (Mikusky, 2007), large-scale stratocumulus cloud decks, and planetary-synoptic scale interaction models which should be relevant for Earth System Models of Intermediate Complexity (EMICs). Here we summarize the general framework and use the example of quasi-geostrophic theory to demonstrate its application...|$|E
