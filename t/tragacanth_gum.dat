2500|$|Some {{difficulty}} {{has arisen}} since {{the passing of}} the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act concerning the use of the Pharmacopoeia as a legal standard for the drugs and preparations contained in it. The Pharmacopoeia is defined in the preface as only [...] "intended to afford {{to the members of the}} medical profession and those engaged in the preparation of medicines throughout the British Empire one uniform standard and guide whereby the nature and composition of, substances to be used in medicine may be ascertained and determined". It is obvious that it cannot be an encyclopaedia of substances used in medicine, and can only be used as a standard for the substances and preparations contained in it, and for no others. It has been held in the Divisional Courts (Dickins v. Randerson) that the Pharmacopoeia is a standard for official preparations asked for under their pharmacopoeial name. But there are many substances in the Pharmacopoeia which are not only employed in medicine, but have other uses, such as sulphur, gum benzoin, <b>tragacanth,</b> <b>gum</b> arabic, ammonium carbonate, beeswax, oil of turpentine, linseed oil, and for these a commercial standard of purity as distinct from a medicinal one is needed, since the preparations used in medicine should be of the highest possible degree of purity obtainable, and this standard would be too high and too expensive for ordinary purposes. The use of trade synonyms in the Pharmacopoeia, such as saltpetre for purified potassium nitrate, and milk of sulphur for precipitated sulphur, is partly answerable for this difficulty, and has proved to be a mistake, since it affords ground for legal prosecution if a chemist sells a drug of ordinary commercial purity for trade purposes, instead of the purified preparation which is official in the Pharmacopoeia for medicinal use. This would not be the case if the trade synonym were omitted. For many drugs and chemicals not in the Pharmacopoeia there is no standard of purity that can be used under the Adulteration of Food and Drugs Act, and for these, as well as for the commercial quality of those drugs and essential oils which are also in the Pharmacopoeia, a legal standard of commercial purity is much needed. This subject formed the basis of discussion at several meetings of the Pharmaceutical Society, and the results have been embodied in a work called Suggested Standards for Foods and Drugs by C.G. Moor, which indicates the average degree of purity of many drugs and chemicals used in the arts, as well as the highest degree of purity obtainable in commerce of those used in medicine.|$|E

40|$|SAMPLES of <b>gum</b> <b>tragacanth</b> {{from various}} species of Astragalus {{have been shown}} (Roe, 1959) to inhibit, in vivo, the growth of several {{different}} mouse ascites tumours. Preliminary results of investigations into the mode of inhibitory action of <b>gum</b> <b>tragacanth</b> have also been reported (Galbraith, Mayhew and Roe, 1962). In the latter investigations it was shown that, in vitro, <b>gum</b> <b>tragacanth</b> becomes attached to the ascites tumour cell surface during the first 30 minutes' treatment with consequent damage to the cells. It was suggested, further, that the gum acts in vivo as a mitotic blocking agent against these tumour cells but the evidence for this was not conclusive. The results reported in the present paper demonstrate: (a) the effect of <b>gum</b> <b>tragacanth</b> on the mitotic index of Landschutz ascites tumour cells after in vivo treatment; and (b) the comparative mitotic effects of a non-tumourinhibitory gum, gum Karaya, and of several samples of <b>gum</b> <b>tragacanth</b> whose tumour-inhibitory action had been reduced by various chemical treatments.

50|$|Colloidal or {{eutectic}} soldering {{was used}} by the Etruscans, and employs a colloidal mixture of <b>tragacanth</b> <b>gum</b> and copper salts. The mixture lowers the melting points of both granules and base, and causes the copper to diffuse into both at the point of contact, creating a strong metallic bond. The colloidal solder is painted onto the surface of the base, and the granules arranged on the wet solder using a fine brush, after which the piece is left to dry. It is then fired in a reducing kiln causing the tragacanth to burn off and release the copper salt. At the eutectic temperature (890 °C) the copper diffuses into the granules and base, joining them together.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to other}} inks, gel ink has higher viscosity, which {{supports}} {{a higher proportion}} of pigments in the medium. The pigments are typically copper phthalocyanine and iron oxides, and the gel is made up of water and biopolymers, such as xanthan gum and <b>tragacanth</b> <b>gum,</b> as well as some types of polyacrylate thickeners. The pigments are opaque, and gel pens are available in several bright and pastel colours, as well as opalescent, metallic, and glittery colours which show up clearly on dark paper. Many gel inks are water resistant, and are not washed away by water once the ink has dried. Fraud resistant gel ink is unaffected by solvents such as acetone, and resists cheque washing.|$|E

In Torah scrolls, the principal tannin substance was derived from the leaves of the salam-tree (Acacia etbaica), a tree known locally by the name qaraḍ (garadh). These leaves, being astringent, have the same function as gall. A bath solution of the crushed leaves of this tree, into which raw leather had been inserted for prolonged soaking, would take only 15 days for curing. The water and leaves, however, required changing after seven or eight days, and the leather needed to be turned over daily. Usually such treatment would suffice, without the need of spreading any other salve onto the leather, but only in cases where there was an erasure and the newly applied ink would spread would scribes in Yemen practise [...] "sizing" [...] of the leather, a process so-called by treating the leather parchment with a paste of <b>Tragacanth</b> <b>gum</b> (كثيراء) or Gum arabic, and allowing the place to dry before applying ink.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effect of incorporation of selected additives on fat uptake and sensory quality of two traditional deep fried snacks. Design/methodology/approach – A wheat-based snack Diamond cuts, and a rice and gram-based spicy snack Kodbale, were chosen. The products were prepared by incorporating to the dough, 0. 2, 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1. 0 per cent of 11 different additives like <b>gum</b> acacia, <b>gum</b> <b>Tragacanth,</b> Methylcellulose, Gaur <b>Gum,</b> Pectin, Gum Karaya, Gum Carageenan, Xanthan Gum, Gum Gellan, Seafoam and Beligara. Products were evaluated for sensory attributes and fat uptake was estimated by soxhlet extraction. Findings – Results indicated that average fat uptake in Diamond cuts and Kodbale was 28. 00 and 30 per cent, respectively. In Diamond cuts, while addition of additives did not alter fat uptake remarkably, a slight decrease in the case of <b>gum</b> <b>Tragacanth</b> (0. 2 per cent) and Gaur Gum and Gum Carageenan (0. 75 per cent) was observed. Statistical analysis of sensory attributes revealed only a marginal difference in textural quality of Diamond cuts incorporated with Gaur Gum, Pectin and Beligara. In Kodbale, fat uptake was marginally lowered by the addition of Gaur <b>Gum,</b> <b>gum</b> <b>Tragacanth,</b> Xanthan <b>Gum</b> and Gum Carageenan at 0. 75 per cent. No significant differences were observed among the sensory qualities except for marginal differences in textural quality of Kodbale incorporated with Gaur Gum, Gum Carageenan and Beligara. It can be concluded that addition of additives did not influence the fat uptake or sensory quality of fried products studied to a significant extent. Originality/value – Since some of the additives improved textural quality of products and fried products are usually stored and consumed, these additives can probably help in improving the texture of stored products. Further studies in this area would help in confirming this...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} hydrocolloids on the gelatinisation behaviour of hard wheat flour were investigated. Influence of guar, xanthan, Arabic, {{carboxy methyl cellulose}} (CMC) and <b>tragacanth</b> <b>gums</b> on wheat flour was studied using micro viscoamylograph. It was found that all hydrocolloids except tragacanth greatly modified the gelatinisation properties of wheat flour. Guar and xanthan significantly lowered the gelatinisation temperature, enhanced peak viscosity, increased the breakdown during cooking, promoted the stability during cooling and thus decreased the tendency to setback. Gum Arabic lowers the peak viscosity, reduces breakdown during heating and thus provides increased stability during cooking. The addition of CMC to the wheat flour resulted in maximum stability during cooling. It also produced large breakdown during heating which provided maximum destabilization and made the cooking easier. These results suggest that by adding gums gelatinisation properties of wheat flour can be greatly modified and this {{could be used for}} the improvement of different wheat products...|$|R

Various plant gums, which have been used as Suspending agents include, Acacia, Compound Tragacanth, xanthan gum. In view of importance of mucilage in pharmaceuticals for the manufacture of suspension, Cassia roxburghii seed gum (family Fabaceae/Leguminosae) were evaluated by comparing with Acacia and Compound <b>Tragacanth</b> <b>gum</b> at concentration 2. 5 and 3 %w/v in sulphamethoxazole suspension. The prepared suspension was evaluated for its sedimentation volume, rheology and particle size analysis. The Cassia roxburghii (filtered gum) at 2. 5 %w/v produced good suspendability compared to the Cassia roxburghii (Defatted gum), Acacia and Compound <b>Tragacanth</b> <b>gum</b> [...] The suspending ability of the suspending agents were in the order of cassia roxburghii (filtered gum) >Compound Tragacanth> cassia roxburghii (defatted gum) >Acacia gum. The results showed that sedimentation volume, viscosity and particle size were directly proportional to the concentration of the suspending agents. The reverse case was observed with the flow rate. The present studies indicates that Cassia roxburghii mucilage obtained by filteration method appeared to exhibit the best suspendability for sulphamethoxazole suspensions, compared with compound Tragacanth, Cassia roxburgii (defatted gum) and Acacia gum, and can be employed as stabilizer and thickener of choice in pharmaceutical suspension...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{presence}} of gluten proteins in rice flour leads to some problems for patients of celiac; a digestive autoimmune disease. Consumption of a non-gluten regime can decrease {{the effects of}} this disease. The aim {{of this study was to}} produce a non-gluten cake with an appropriate quality and high nutritional value by using rice flour, quinoa flour, Persian <b>gums,</b> and <b>Tragacanth.</b> Methods: The effect of addition of Persian <b>gums,</b> <b>Tragacanth,</b> and a combination of both of these compounds at levels of 0. 5, 1, and 1. 5 % on texture, color, and sensory characteristics of these cakes was evaluated in this study. Results: The results showed that solidity and viscosity factors were elevated by addition of gum to cake. Using of gums in cakes leads to moisture maintenance inside the cake texture and thus improves mastication property. Furthermore, the results of porosity evaluation showed that addition of Persian <b>gums</b> and <b>Tragacanth</b> decreases the size and increases the number of gas cells inside the cake texture and improves porosity.
