5|$|The {{contracts}} of Edelstein, Epps, and Leonard expired {{at the end}} {{of season}} seven. As a cost-cutting measure, the three actors were asked to accept reduced salaries.

5|$|A year later, at {{the height}} of the 1975 Australian {{constitutional}} crisis, the Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, was dismissed from his post by Governor-General Sir John Kerr, after the Opposition-controlled Senate rejected Whitlam's budget proposals. As Whitlam had a majority in the House of Representatives, Speaker Gordon Scholes appealed to the Queen to reverse Kerr's decision. She declined, stating <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> interfere in decisions reserved by the Constitution of Australia for the governor-general. The crisis fuelled Australian republicanism.|$|E
60|$|Polly soon lured her out again, by assurances <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>n't</b> be utterly despoiled, and {{promises}} to try and soften the hard hearts of her father's creditors, if the ear-rings and the smelling-bottle were attached.|$|R

5|$|After being {{sworn in}} as premier, Dunderdale {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be seeking {{the leadership of the}} Progressive Conservative Party and therefore would only serve in the role of premier until a leadership election was held in the spring of 2011. However, on December 17, 2010, Dunderdale announced that she was reconsidering running for the leadership of the party and that she would make a final decision after Christmas.|$|E
5|$|At Theobald's request, Pope Gregory urged Alice {{to come to}} Rome, {{because the}} {{legitimacy}} of her parents' marriage was to be investigated. Alice refused {{to appear before the}} papal tribunal, but renounced her claim to Champagne and Brie for 40,000 livres tournois and estates yielding a yearly income of 2,000 livres in September 1234. In the agreement with Theobald, she also stated <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> erect fortresses in her estates in Champagne.|$|E
5|$|Closing in Melbourne August 9, 2009, {{the show}} {{transferred}} to Sydney's Capitol Theatre. Previews began on September 5, 2009, {{with the official}} opening on September 12. Shortly into the run, Harrison {{was forced to leave}} the role of Elphaba, so current standby Jemma Rix and Australian theatre veteran Pippa Grandison began to share the role, each appearing in four shows per week. Eventually, it was confirmed <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be returning to the cast.|$|E

60|$|In {{spite of}} her cold indignation, and the fact <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could {{understand}} {{only a part of}} Mattingly's speech, Christie comprehended enough to make her lift her clear eyes to the speaker, as <b>she</b> replied freezingly <b>that</b> <b>she</b> feared <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> trouble them long with her company.|$|R
5|$|Danny, {{aware that}} the Oceanic Flight 815 {{survivors}} are responsible, takes his anger out on Sawyer by violently beating him; Sawyer refrains from fighting back.

She tries to free Sawyer, but he bitterly refuses, remembering Karl's escape and bloody capture. Kate returns to her cage, insisting <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> abandon him, and tells Sawyer that she lied about loving him so that Danny would stop.|$|E
5|$|David {{made several}} visits to California, which she much enjoyed, but her health began to fail. Because her legs had been {{troublesome}} for some time, she suffered {{a succession of}} falls which resulted in several spells in hospital. She became increasingly reclusive but, despite spending periods in bed at home, she continued to work on Ice and Ices. She realised <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be able to finish the work, and asked Norman to complete it for her. It was published in 1994, under the title Harvest of the Cold Months.|$|E
5|$|In April 2016, Bravo {{announced}} that the series is renewed for a ninth season. Fields confirmed in March 2016 <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be returning to the series.

5000|$|In January 2009, Hazlett drew flak for criticizing Frozen River, an indie film <b>that</b> <b>she</b> claimed <b>would</b> <b>not</b> draw {{ratings for}} the Oscars and calling fans of the film [...] "effete." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to know, sir," [...] asked Willis, [...] "how you got at <b>that</b> likeness. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> hear of the thing, and that's why I had no liking to come troubling you about nothing." ...|$|R
5|$|In January 2011, it was {{confirmed}} that Byung-hun Lee would reprise {{his role as}} Storm Shadow in the sequel. Channing Tatum and Ray Park also returned, as Duke and Snake Eyes, respectively.

Mary's first Parliament, which assembled in early October 1553, declared the marriage of her parents valid and abolished Edward's religious laws. Church doctrine was restored to the form it had taken in the 1539 Six Articles, which (among other things) re-affirmed clerical celibacy. Married priests were deprived of their benefices.|$|E
5|$|Incumbent Prime Minister Kiviniemi {{said that}} she was ready to work with any party in Finland. When pressed by the media she said <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> rule out working with the True Finns pending {{cooperation}} on negotiating a government platform. The True Finns and the Green League have both confirmed that the two parties are ideologically too far from each other to sit in the same coalition. The True Finns' main campaign issues—lowering refugee quotas and cutting foreign aid and Finland's financial contribution to the EU—were seen as a possible hindrance to coalition talks.|$|E
60|$|Ethel smiled, but hurried her departure, for she saw Blanche again {{tormented by}} Mr. George Rivers, {{to know what}} had become of the guard, telling her <b>that,</b> if <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> say, he should be furiously jealous.|$|R
60|$|Grace was {{too proud}} to persist. He was right, of course, {{but the fact that}} he would sooner part from her than incur the {{slightest}} risk of breaking faith with Tomlinson had nevertheless its sting. <b>That,</b> however, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> show.|$|R
50|$|Although {{selected}} by Labour {{as a candidate}} for the 2007 Scottish Parliament elections, she announced in June 2006 <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> instead <b>not</b> seek re-election.

Sleepless, and losing all hope, she attempted suicide; but was discovered by her nurse, in whom she confided. The nurse tried to make Myrrha suppress the infatuation, but later agreed to help Myrrha into her father's bed if she promised <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> again try to kill herself.|$|E
5|$|Wiggins and {{his mother}} were very close, and her 1983 Alzheimer's disease {{diagnosis}} {{may have contributed to}} his drug problems. He was devastated <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be able to enjoy his success in the major leagues. In the last few years of Wiggins' life, he enjoyed a closer relationship with his father, Albert, and he often took his children on visits to see their grandfather. Wiggins had a very difficult time with his father's death in May 1990.|$|E
5|$|A 15-year-old elephant, Ellie May, had {{acquired}} an undeserved {{reputation for being}} dangerous, which made her extremely difficult to sell. Her food costs became difficult to justify, but Grayson refused to have her put down. Although he left the zoo in January 1978, Grayson returned frequently to care for Ellie May, the last animal left at the zoo. Eventually Rotterdam Zoo agreed to take her, and plans were made to transport the elephant to the Netherlands. Ellie May refused to budge however, and overnight developed pneumonia and heart failure. Grayson and veterinary surgeon, David Taylor, felt <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> recover, and decided to call in a marksman to euthanise her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am Linda Tressel," [...] said poor Linda. She saw at {{a glance}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> herself <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have known Herr Molk, whom she had never before met without his hat, and <b>she</b> {{perceived}} also <b>that</b> he had not recognised her.|$|R
6000|$|Having {{set out on}} <b>that</b> road, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> turn back; <b>she</b> persisted, {{like any}} woman who is contraried, {{no matter how far}} she ends from her first position: [...] "Yes, like ours now. For this is {{probably}} the dark hour before the dawn. We must wait." ...|$|R
60|$|Into {{the minds}} of Dora and Miss Panney there came, simultaneously, this idea: {{that no matter how}} much or how often Miriam might wear <b>that</b> gown, <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be the first one whom it had figuratively {{invested}} with the prerogatives of the mistress of Cobhurst.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{announcement}} by Richmond Centre MLA Olga Ilich <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be seeking re-election, Howard announced, in January 2008, {{that he would}} seek to replace Ilich as the BC Liberal Party candidate in the next election. As no one else came forward to challenge Howard, he was acclaimed, in November 2008, to be the BC Liberal candidate. In the general election, held in May 2009, he was challenged by a New Democratic Party candidate, notary public Kam Brar, and a Green Party candidate, teacher Michael Wolfe, and Nation Alliance Party candidate, accountant Kang Chen. The riding {{was considered to be}} a safe seat for the BC Liberals to win, which the 54-year-old Howard did win with over 60% of the vote, with his BC Liberal Party winning a majority government.|$|E
5|$|Hepburn {{was known}} for being {{fiercely}} private, and would not give interviews or talk to fans for much of her career. She distanced herself from the celebrity lifestyle, uninterested in a social scene she saw as tedious and superficial, and she wore casual clothes that went strongly against convention {{in an era of}} glamour. She rarely appeared in public, even avoiding restaurants, and once wrestled a camera out of a photographer's hand when he took a picture without asking. Despite her zeal for privacy, she enjoyed her fame, and later confessed <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have liked the press to ignore her completely. The protective attitude thawed as she aged; beginning with a two-hour-long interview on The Dick Cavett Show in 1973, Hepburn became increasingly open with the public.|$|E
5|$|In February 2010, Dannii Minogue {{confirmed}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> {{attend the}} auditions for series 7 due to being pregnant. It was confirmed that guest judges would take Minogue's place alongside Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh and Cheryl Cole during the auditions. The guest judges were Geri Halliwell, Natalie Imbruglia, Katy Perry, Pixie Lott and Nicole Scherzinger. On 11 June, Minogue {{was confirmed by}} ITV to return for the judges' houses stage. Cole missed the Manchester auditions and bootcamp due to having malaria, so Scherzinger returned as a guest judge for bootcamp. Cole then returned for the judges' houses stage.|$|E

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of season 4, Diana is seen in a vision/dream of Jordan Collier, having the power of freezing time. Although later in the show, it's revealed <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is immune {{to the effect of}} promicin, it's not for sure, <b>that</b> eventually <b>she</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> be able to develop an ability.|$|R
50|$|The {{dry heat}} of the Punjab had a bad effect on Alice's health. Two years after she arrived it was clear <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be <b>not</b> be able to {{maintain}} a good quality of life in India, and so Wellesley resigned from the American Mission and together they returned to Ireland.|$|R
