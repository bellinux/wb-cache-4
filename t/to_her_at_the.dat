Fletcher Marine Works yard in Hoboken that outfitted her for 242 first-, 310 second-, and 876 third-class passengers. On 8 January 1920, while Kroonland was still under repair, the American Line ship , berthed next <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Fletcher yard, caught fire. In the multi-alarm fire, firefighters believed that St. Louis was a lost cause, and so focused their efforts on saving Kroonland. At one point, St. Louis heeled over and leaned on Kroonland but the only resulting damages were scorch marks on her side.|$|E
5|$|Ryder {{is sought}} after by the town's women but begins courting a very light mixed-race woman from Washington, DC named Molly Dixon. He plans to propose <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> next Blue Vein ball, {{for which he}} is giving a speech. Before the talk, he meets an older, plain-looking black woman. Her name is 'Liza Jane, and she is searching for her husband Sam Taylor, whom she has not seen in 25 years. She says she was married to Sam before the Civil War, when she was enslaved and he was a hired {{apprentice}} to the family of her master. Despite Taylor's being a free black, the family tried to sell him into slavery. She assisted Sam in escaping, and he promised to return and free her, but she was sold to a different master. Ryder says that Taylor could have died, may have outgrown her, or could have remarried. However, she persists in saying that her husband has remained faithful, and refuses to stop looking. Ryder advises her that slave marriages did not count after the war; marriages had to be officially made legal. She shows him an old picture of Sam and leaves.|$|E

Jack continues to explain that John Locke blew up the submarine that was to take him home. Claire suddenly collapses with blood gushing from her face. Juliet takes Jack and Kate aside and tells them she knows what's wrong with Claire because she did it <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> camp, Juliet explains that Claire's immune system has turned against her due to a latent reaction to medication in her bloodstream. The medication was designed by Juliet to keep Claire alive during her pregnancy. She was brought to the island to find out why women couldn't have children. The mother's body treats the pregnancy as a foreign invader and the immune system attacks; every pregnant woman on the island has died. Claire was the first to survive even though she showed some of the symptoms.|$|E

25|$|Caroline is {{introduced}} in Last Tango in Halifaxs series premiere (2012), {{as a successful}} headmistress dealing with the fallout of her husband's affair and her own clandestine liaison with Kate. At {{the climax of the}} episode she is shocked to learn that her mother Celia has decided to marry Alan; an old love interest she had recently {{met for the first time}} in sixty years. She is also shocked upon discovering that Alan is father to Gillian, a working-class woman who Caroline has previously insulted. After learning that John is still seeing his lover Judith (Ronni Ancona), Caroline tells him he has no right to carry on living in their marital home. She grows closer to Kate, and explains to her that she finds it hard to be open with her feelings, having long suppressed her emotions. In the following episode, Caroline grows closer to Gillian after their respective parents go missing. She admits to John that she has moved on and began seeing someone else. When Caroline makes her relationship with Kate official, her eldest son William (Edward Ashley) takes it in his stride, but her younger son Lawrence (Louis Greatorex) is upset. When Judith arrives at Caroline's house she learns of the relationship and informs John who tells Celia. Celia refuses to accept that her daughter is gay and her bigoted words and attitude at a dinner party drive Kate away. Caroline has an angry argument with her mother, blaming her for her emotional repression and for ruining her chance of happiness with Kate. She reminds her that she had previously tried to come out <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 18, and that it had been her prejudices that had forced her to live a closeted existence. Celia, realising that she may have ruined her relationship with both her daughter and the liberal-minded Alan, is compelled to ask Kate to give Caroline another chance.|$|E

Roxy suspects that Jack and Honey are having an affair and tells Ronnie, who confronts Jack. He denies this and later, Roxy decides Amy should move without her and then asks Ronnie to adopt Amy. After an emotional discussion, Ronnie agrees but later the sisters secretly plan for Roxy to join the couple in Essex. However, on her wedding day, Roxy packs her things as she reveals she is moving away to live with Glenda and Danny, feeling as if she will ruin Ronnie's happiness. After an argument, Ronnie convinces Roxy to give her away, and she agrees. While {{on the way to}} the wedding, Ronnie and Roxy visit Phil for a final time and take a picture with him, unbeknownst to him that it'll be the last time he'll see them.

At 07:30 on 14 December, he {{instructed}} officers to attend 97 Langworthy Road and arrest everyone that they found there. [...] Jean Powell and McNeilly laughed and joked with {{each other as they}} were arrested. Initially, all six denied involvement. Under questioning, Dudson, who had been urged by his father to tell the truth, began to talk. D.I. Wall said of Dudson's statement: [...] "As the story began to unfold, we just couldn't believe it. I kept asking myself how one human being could do this to another." [...] Police officers [...] "wept as the extent of Suzanne's suffering was revealed," [...] and together with civilian staff at the station the police collected cash to send flowers <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> hospital.

[...] Moreover, she desired for her grandfather {{to listen to the}} song before passing away. Although Cyrus was never able to sing it for him, her father played a quick cut of [...] "I Miss You" [...] for Ron towards the end of his life. The singer said she liked to believe that the song gave her grandfather hope, in a similar fashion which he gave and continues to give hope <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> age of 70, Ron Cyrus died on February 28, 2006, two days prior the red carpet premiere of Hannah Montana.

Cyrus then recorded the song for her debut album, Meet Miley Cyrus.

500|$|Anne {{was unable}} to walk between January and July 1713. At Christmas, she was feverish, and lay {{unconscious}} for hours, which led to rumours of her impending death. She recovered, but was seriously ill again in March. By July, Anne had lost confidence in Harley; his secretary recorded that Anne told the cabinet [...] "that he neglected all business; that he was seldom to be understood; that when he did explain himself, she could not depend upon {{the truth of what}} he said; that he never came <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time she appointed; that he often came drunk; [...] last, to crown all, he behaved himself towards her with ill manner, indecency and disrespect." [...] On 27 July 1714, during Parliament's summer recess, she dismissed Harley as Lord Treasurer. Despite failing health, which her doctors blamed on the emotional strain of matters of state, she attended two late-night cabinet meetings that failed to determine Harley's successor. A third meeting was cancelled when she became too ill to attend. She was rendered unable to speak by a stroke on 30 July 1714, the anniversary of Gloucester's death, and on the advice of the Privy Council handed the treasurer's staff of office to Whig grandee Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury. She died around 7:30a.m. on 1 August 1714. John Arbuthnot, one of her doctors, thought her death was a release from a life of ill-health and tragedy; he wrote to Jonathan Swift, [...] "I believe sleep was never more welcome to a weary traveller than death was to her." ...|$|E

500|$|Ferrier {{spent two}} months in University College Hospital. As a result, she missed her CBE investiture; the ribbon was brought <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{hospital}} by a friend. Meanwhile, her sister found her a ground-floor apartment in St John's Wood, since she {{would no longer be}} able to negotiate the many stairs at Frognal Mansions. She moved to her new home in early April, but after only seven weeks was forced to return to hospital where, despite two further operations, her condition continued to deteriorate. Early in June she heard that she had been awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, the first female vocalist to receive this honour since Muriel Foster in 1914. In a letter to the secretary of the Society she wrote that this [...] "unbelievable, wondrous news has done more than anything to make me feel so much better". This letter, dated 9 June, is probably the last that Ferrier signed herself. [...] As she weakened she saw only her sister and a few very close friends, and, although there were short periods of respite, her decline was unremitting. She died at University College Hospital on 8 October 1953, aged 41; the date for which, while still hopeful of recovery, she had undertaken to sing Frederick Delius's A Mass of Life at the 1953 Leeds Festival. Ferrier was cremated a few days later, at Golders Green Crematorium, after a short private service. She left an estate worth £15,134, which her biographer Maurice Leonard observes was [...] "not a fortune for a world-famous singer, even by the standards of the day".|$|E
500|$|Rocket Dog {{is one of}} Flower's many {{daughters and}} would later become the {{dominant}} female of the Whiskers group. [...] When the Whiskers group temporarily split into two groups during a drought and food shortage in the third series, Rocket Dog assumed {{the leadership of the}} splinter group. She mated with a roving Zappa male {{in the middle of the}} third series, but her pups died in a premature birth caused by the strain of her new-found leadership. When the splinter group was reunited with the Whiskers, Rocket Dog returned to being a subordinate female under her mother without any fuss. After Flower's death near the end of the series, Rocket Dog permanently assumed leadership of the entire Whiskers group, and moved the group to a new burrow. Wilson, a roving male from the Commandoes, attempted to mate with Rocket Dog, but was chased off by Zaphod, Flower's former partner and still dominant male. [...] In the last episode of the third series, Maybelline rebelled against her sister's rule, but Rocket Dog was able to maintain leadership, causing Maybelline to leave the Whiskers and start her own group. In the finale of Season 4, Rocket Dog is bitten by a puff adder. Rocket Dog survives the deadly bite. After filming of the fourth series concluded, and before it aired, several newspapers reported that Rocket Dog was killed while crossing a road on 28 April 2008 and that Animal Planet planned to include a tribute <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the series. A note was also posted to the Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat website; it was subsequently removed along with all other post season updates, at the request of Animal Planet, but was restored after the fourth series finished airing.|$|E

After hearing a demo version of the track, she begged Iglesias to let her record the song, telling {{him that it was}} [...] "her song". Lopez, who was going through a divorce with Marc Anthony and the [...] "breakup of a family", felt as if the song had come <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> [...] "perfect moment". According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, I want to come out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again. Looking back on the song in December 2012, Lopez stated that: [...] "'Dance Again' became my anthem ... an expression of what I needed to do at that time in my life and for what I was taking on with [...] It was a beautiful metaphor that became my reality." ...|$|E
