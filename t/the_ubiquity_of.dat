5|$|A central {{organizing}} {{concept in}} biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, {{and that all}} life-forms known have a common origin. The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth, both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool. This universal common ancestor of all organisms {{is believed to have}} appeared about 3.5 billion years ago. Biologists regard <b>the</b> <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (see: origin of life).|$|E
5|$|The Astonishing {{is set in}} a dystopian future United States {{and follows}} the Ravenskill Rebel Militia in their efforts to defy the Great Northern Empire of the Americas using the magical power of music. It was {{inspired}} by contemporary fantasy and science fiction franchises such as Game of Thrones and Star Wars, as well as Petrucci's observations on <b>the</b> <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> technological automation in modern-day society. In their effort to match the album's narrative, Dream Theater wrote songs {{in a wide variety of}} styles ranging from mellow ballads to their more conventional progressive metal sound.|$|E

50|$|Because of the {{requirement}} of enclosure, and <b>the</b> near <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> gravity, strictly and ideally isolated systems do not actually occur in experiments or in nature. Though very useful, they are strictly hypothetical.|$|R
50|$|Despite <b>the</b> {{relative}} <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> his inventions, Murdoch did {{not become}} rich because of them. He deliberately chose not to sue companies that violated his patents, satisfied instead {{that they were being}} put to good use.|$|R
25|$|Because of <b>the</b> <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> vector spaces, {{linear algebra}} {{is used in}} many fields of mathematics, natural sciences, {{computer}} science, and social science. Below are just some examples of applications of linear algebra.|$|E
25|$|Some {{particular}} contemporary {{developments are}} {{the proliferation of}} front- and all-wheel drive, {{the adoption of the}} diesel engine, and <b>the</b> <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> fuel injection. Most modern passenger cars are front-wheel-drive monocoque/unibody designs, with transversely mounted engines.|$|E
25|$|While the {{practices}} of Vajrayāna are not known in Sutrayāna, all Sutrayāna practices are common to Vajrayāna. Without training in the preliminary practices, <b>the</b> <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> allusions to them in Vajrayāna is meaningless and even successful Vajrayāna initiation becomes impossible.|$|E
50|$|SAGANet.org (Social Action for Grassroots Astrobiology Network - www.saganet.org) is {{a social}} and {{collaborative}} web-platform created to connect scientist with the public, leveraging <b>the</b> increasing <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> social media as a platform to engage the nation’s youth.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is a {{deepening}} of quantification notions in the aspect of the modular logic. Therefore, it approaches modulated logic of the plausible that seeks to formalize <b>the</b> quantifier <b>of</b> <b>ubiquity.</b> <b>The</b> text presents a proposal, introduced by Paul Halmos, to interpret a classical quantifier in algebraic models and as a original contribution, extends this model to an algebraic model for <b>the</b> quantifier <b>of</b> <b>ubiquity.</b> Comment: in Portugues...|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} a zwischenzug is often listed as a tactic, but might {{properly}} be called a counter-tactic instead. The effect of a zwischenzug {{is to change the}} status quo before a tactic can come to fruition. <b>The</b> near <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> zwischenzug makes long combinations all the more rare and impressive.|$|R
25|$|The first {{paved road}} linking Wetumpka with Montgomery was {{completed}} in 1924. Montgomery continued to grow during the two World Wars because of military spending {{in the region and}} the growth of the state government. By the 1950s, <b>the</b> <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> the automobile allowed Wetumpka's residents to commute daily to Montgomery for work.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of {{the film}} tax credit in Rhode Island are urging state {{officials}} to maintain the program, pointing to a study showing the program created more than 4,000 jobs in the state between 2006–2009. Critics of the program say <b>the</b> <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> incentives in most states have diminished Rhode Island's competitive advantage and that the funds would be better spent elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|The Mayas {{engaged in}} {{a large number of}} festivals and rituals on fixed days of the year, many of which {{involved}} animal sacrifices and all of which seem to have involved blood letting. <b>The</b> <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> this practice is a unique aspect of pre-Columbian Mesoamerican culture, and is now believed to have originated with the Olmecs, the region's first civilization.|$|E
50|$|A notable {{feature of}} the {{commercials}} is <b>the</b> seeming <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> famous athletes on the ESPN campus. Some are even depicted doing menial, everyday tasks, usually while wearing their game uniforms. Athletes often have their idiosyncrasies parodied — for example, gymnast Kerri Strug being carried around ESPN headquarters because of her famous ankle injury.|$|R

25|$|A common {{element of}} pop icon status is <b>the</b> <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> imagery and allusions to the iconic figure. It {{is common for}} the figure to be {{recognized}} and even celebrated in areas outside the original source of celebrity status. An {{example of this is}} Albert Einstein, a physicist whose image and legacy have been represented in comic strips, T-shirts, greeting cards and many other contexts.|$|E
25|$|To aid {{digestion}} {{in those}} with lactose intolerance, milk with added bacterial cultures such as Lactobacillus acidophilus ("acidophilus milk") and bifidobacteria ("a/B milk") is available in some areas. Another milk with Lactococcus lactis bacteria cultures ("cultured buttermilk") often is used in cooking to replace the traditional use of naturally soured milk, which has become rare due to <b>the</b> <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> pasteurization, which also kills the naturally occurring Lactococcus bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> EULAs agreements, {{under which}} a single click {{can be taken}} as consent to the entire text, {{relatively}} little caselaw has resulted from their use. It {{has been established in}} most common law jurisdictions that this type of agreement can be a binding contract in certain circumstances. This does not, however, mean that every such agreement is a contract, or that every term in one is enforceable.|$|E
60|$|This concise {{interrogation}} characterises <b>the</b> seeming <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{voice of}} the cuckoo, and dispossesses the creature almost of a corporeal existence; the Imagination being tempted to this exertion of her power by a consciousness in the memory that the cuckoo is almost perpetually heard throughout the season of spring, but seldom becomes an object of sight.|$|R

50|$|Several {{versions}} of progressive education succeeded in transforming the educational landscape: <b>the</b> utter <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> guidance counseling, to name but one example, springs from the progressive period. Radical variations of educational progressivism were troubled and short-lived, {{a fact that}} supports some understandings {{of the notion of}} failure. But they were perhaps too rare and ill-funded to constitute a thorough test.|$|R
25|$|Optics {{is part of}} {{everyday}} life. <b>The</b> <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> visual systems in biology indicates the central role optics plays as the science {{of one of the}} five senses. Many people benefit from eyeglasses or contact lenses, and optics are integral to the functioning of many consumer goods including cameras. Rainbows and mirages are examples of optical phenomena. Optical communication provides the backbone for both the Internet and modern telephony.|$|E
25|$|The most {{conspicuous}} habit {{of this species}} is a near-constant tail wagging, a trait that has given the species, and indeed the genus, its common name. In spite of <b>the</b> <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> this behaviour, the reasons for it are poorly understood. It {{has been suggested that}} it may flush prey, or signal submissiveness to other wagtails. A recent study has suggested instead that it is a signal of vigilance to potential predators.|$|E
25|$|Most flash drives ship {{preformatted}} {{with the}} FAT32, or exFAT file systems. <b>The</b> <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> the FAT32 file system allows {{the drive to}} be accessed on virtually any host device with USB support. Also, standard FAT maintenance utilities (e.g., ScanDisk) {{can be used to}} repair or retrieve corrupted data. However, because a flash drive appears as a USB-connected hard drive to the host system, the drive can be reformatted to any file system supported by the host operating system.|$|E

50|$|During 2003, <b>the</b> sheer <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> {{interactive}} {{forms of}} entertainment and {{the breadth of}} genres and types of video games outgrew the combined ceremony, and the event was divided into the BAFTA Video Games Awards and the BAFTA Interactive Awards Despite making headlines with high-profile winners like Halo 2 and Half-Life 2 the interactive division was discontinued and disappeared from BAFTA's publicity material after only two ceremonies.|$|R
25|$|In {{the social}} sciences, a {{perceived}} clinical bias exists in agoraphobia research. Branches {{of the social}} sciences, especially geography, have increasingly become interested {{in what may be}} thought of as a spatial phenomenon. One such approach links the development of agoraphobia with modernity. Factors considered contributing to agoraphobia within modernity are <b>the</b> <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> cars and urbanization. These have helped develop the expansion of public space, on one hand, and the contraction of private space on the other, thus creating in the minds of agoraphobic-prone people a tense, unbridgeable gulf between the two.|$|E
25|$|A {{distinct}} {{feature of}} Bangkok is <b>the</b> <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> street vendors selling goods ranging from food items to clothing and accessories. It {{has been estimated}} that the city may have over 100,000 hawkers. While the BMA has authorised the practice in 287 sites, the majority of activity in another 407 sites takes place illegally. Although they take up pavement space and block pedestrian traffic, many of the city's residents depend on these vendors for their meals, and the BMA's efforts to curb their numbers have largely been unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|Between 1864 and 1880 Karl Heinrich Ulrichs {{published}} {{a series of}} twelve tracts, which he collectively titled Research on the Riddle of Man-Manly Love. In 1867, {{he became the first}} self-proclaimed homosexual person to speak out publicly in defense of homosexuality when he pleaded at the Congress of German Jurists in Munich for a resolution urging the repeal of anti-homosexual laws. Sexual Inversion by Havelock Ellis, published in 1896, challenged theories that homosexuality was abnormal, as well as stereotypes, and insisted on <b>the</b> <b>ubiquity</b> <b>of</b> homosexuality and its association with intellectual and artistic achievement.|$|E
