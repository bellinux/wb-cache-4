5|$|Describing {{the choice}} of {{developing}} a game based on the existing White Wolf property over creating their own, Boyarsky said that although an original property lacked the constraints of an existing one, <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> was {{that it had not}} been tested and could be rejected by its potential audience; an existing property was proven. Troika tried to stay {{as close as possible to}} the White Wolf rules, while reducing the number of abilities and disciplines to those relevant to Bloodlines gameplay.|$|E
5|$|Radstock {{was one of}} the {{missions}} established in 1913 by <b>the</b> <b>Downside</b> community. A temporary building of thin wooden beams and asbestos blocks was erected in 1913, and dedicated to St Hugh. Its altar rails and benches came from Prior Park. Dom Mackey was succeeded in 1918 by Dom Ambrose Agius, who acquired a disused printing works, formerly a barn and converted it into the present church in Westfield, which opened in 1929. It was rebuilt after a serious fire in 1991. It has a statue of the patron on its façade.|$|E
5|$|Some jumping spiders' {{visual acuity}} exceeds {{by a factor}} of ten that of dragonflies, which have by far the best vision among insects; in fact the human eye is only about five times sharper than a jumping spider's. They achieve this by a telephoto-like series of lenses, a four-layer retina and the ability to swivel their eyes and {{integrate}} images from different stages in the scan. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> is that the scanning and integrating processes are relatively slow.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>downside</b> to the CSBS {{was that}} the settings, made through four main input dials, were useful for one {{operational}} setup, a given altitude and heading. If the aircraft manoeuvred, the entire system had to be reset. Additionally, the system required the bomber's direction to be compared to objects on the ground, requiring a time-consuming process sighting through thin metal wires against a suitable object on the ground below. As the sight was not stabilized, any manoeuvres to correct for misalignment interfered {{with the ability to}} measure the heading, so these corrections further extended the bomb run. The CSBS generally required the bomber to fly straight and level for a lengthy time.|$|E
5|$|The {{special purpose}} {{entities}} {{were used for}} more than just circumventing accounting conventions. As a result of one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its earnings were overstated. Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own illiquid investments using special purpose entities. However, investors were oblivious {{to the fact that the}} special purpose entities were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> risk. Notable examples of special purpose entities that Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and LJM.|$|E
5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{dominant}} run was derailed in Abu Dhabi {{when his}} car {{was found to have}} insufficient fuel after qualifying and he was subsequently moved {{to the back of the}} grid. As Lewis Hamilton led the race away from the start, Vettel started from pit lane and took advantage of a chaotic opening corner that saw Nico Hülkenberg, Paul di Resta, Romain Grosjean and Bruno Senna tangle; Hülkenberg was forced out, while di Resta and Grosjean pitted with damage. Vettel began to round up the HRTs, Marussias and Caterhams, but his early progress came at the expense of his front wing endplate when he made contact with Senna at Turn 8 switchback. He chose not to pit for the time being, as the race was interrupted by the intervention of the safety car. Nico Rosberg, who had been forced to pit with damage to his front wing, was in the process of overtaking Narain Karthikeyan as Karthikeyan's car began to fail and the Indian quickly slowed. Rosberg, caught unawares by Karthikeyan's troubles, was launched over the back of the HRT and into the barrier. During the safety car period, Vettel was forced to pit when he swerved to avoid Daniel Ricciardo and crashed into the polystyrene bollard marking the start of the DRS zone, further damaging his wing. Red Bull Racing took the opportunity to pit him early, with <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> being that Vettel would have to do 42 laps on the soft tyre when supplier Pirelli predicted they could only do 36. Meanwhile, Hamilton suffered another mechanical failure while leading the race, and was once again forced out, handing the lead to Kimi Räikkönen while Fernando Alonso inherited second. Vettel began to work his way through the field again, but was forced to make a second stop when his tyres started losing grip. He was saved by the second appearance of the safety car moments later, brought about when di Resta forced Sergio Pérez wide; as Pérez rejoined the circuit, he cut back across the front of Grosjean and the two made contact, which in turn forced Grosjean into the path of Mark Webber. Grosjean and Webber retired, whilst Pérez was given a stop-go penalty. When racing resumed, Räikkönen began to rebuild his lead over Alonso, who was being harried by Jenson Button; Button himself was being harried by Vettel in fourth. Button and Vettel's duel allowed Alonso to break free, and he started chasing down Räikkönen in the last five laps. Räikkönen held on to secure his – and Lotus F1's – first victory of the season. Alonso was second, while Vettel caught and passed Button to complete the podium, keeping a ten-point championship lead in the process. With both Alonso and Vettel finishing on the podium with him, Räikkönen's win was not enough to keep him in contention for the World Drivers' Championship, leaving the title to be fought out between Alonso and Vettel over the final two races of the season.|$|E

25|$|The Thorn is {{the only}} EP {{recorded}} as such by English rock band Siouxsie and the Banshees. It was released in late 1984 by Polydor and remastered in 2004 to be included on <b>the</b> <b>Downside</b> Up box set.|$|E
25|$|On <b>the</b> <b>downside,</b> in {{the early}} morning hours of February 13, 1981, sewer explosions ripped through the {{southern}} part of Old Louisville and near the University of Louisville.

25|$|While this {{machinery}} {{would prove}} capable of outperforming the opposition, <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> was economy of operation.

25|$|The upside is {{security}} of supply (such as food security), <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> huge stockpiles or, in other cases, destruction of commodities. The scheme also makes domestic food more expensive for other countries to purchase and operation of such a scheme can be costly to the operator.|$|E
25|$|Synthesis of {{thalidomide}} has {{usually been}} performed {{as seen in}} scheme 1. This synthesis is a reasonably simplistic three step process. <b>The</b> <b>downside</b> of this process however is that the last step requires a high-temperature melt reaction which demands multiple recrystallizations and is not compliant with standard equipment.|$|E
25|$|The city's {{job market}} scored only 6 points {{out of a}} {{possible}} 100 in the Cities Ranked and Rated guide, as <b>the</b> <b>downside</b> to the low cost of living is an extremely weak local job market that is oversupplied with college-educated residents. The median income in Gainesville is slightly below the U.S. average.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>downside</b> to this {{approach}} is that high-power transmissions are failure-prone devices, especially in the World War II era.

Sports are played most afternoons at Downside with every pupil expected to participate {{at least three times a}} week.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>downside</b> of this {{development}} is the ecological damage due to the low standards of production and excessive sizes of dams (the bigger projects were favoured by the industrial authorities and received more funding), the increased humidity sharpened the already hard climate. Another powerplant project on Katun River in Altai mountains in the 1980s, which was widely protested publicly, was cancelled.|$|E

5000|$|A {{complete}} emulator {{provides a}} simulation of {{all aspects of}} the hardware, allowing all of it to be controlled and modified, and allowing debugging on a normal PC. <b>The</b> <b>downsides</b> are expense and slow operation, in some cases up to 100 times slower than the final system.|$|R
50|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>downsides</b> of <b>the</b> {{constant}} depression carburettor is in {{high performance}} applications. Since {{it relies on}} restricting air flow {{in order to produce}} enrichment during acceleration, the throttle response lacks punch. By contrast, the fixed choke design adds extra fuel under these conditions using its accelerator pump.|$|R
