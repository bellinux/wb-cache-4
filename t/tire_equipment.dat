40|$|Soil {{compaction}} i. e. {{reduction of}} the soil pore volume {{is a big problem}} within agriculture, mainly because it leads to poor aeration and increased mechanical resistance. The farmer can reduce the effects by the choice of <b>tire</b> <b>equipment</b> and tire inflation pressure. In this experiment, which was carried out in the autumn 1994, the compaction effects of some different tires (Taurus, Kleber, Michelin and Twin) and tire inflation pressures (low, recommended and high) were studied The investigation included three kinds of measurements; track depth and penetration resistance which were carried out in the field on a 10 am soil and soil stress which was carried out in doors on coarse, dry sand. The results from the measurements, partly in the field and partly on coarse sand, pointed in the same direction. The tire inflation pressure had a very large influence on the track depth, penetration resistance and soil stress. The influence of tire inflation pressure and tire type decreased with depth. Low profile tires reduced compaction mainly by allowing the use of a lower tire inflation pressure. Trelleborg TWIN which is a crossply tire resulted in a higher pressure in the soil than tires of radial type. This is probably caused by the design of the crossply tire, which gives more stiff tire sides than for radial tires...|$|E

40|$|Grassland is a {{great part}} of Swedish {{agriculture}} and there is a demand of what the grassland yield is in practice. To be able to control the economic of the milkproduction {{it is important for the}} farmer to know how big quantities of pasture there is to use during the year. The work is based on interviews of 22 farmers from southern part of Sweden. Their area of grassland fluctuate between 16 up to 360 hectares. The questionnaire content 32 questions. The most common way to weight the green plant material is to drive over a scale, and to measure the dry extract with your own gauge. It takes in average two minutes to weight one load of green plant material. The pressure of the soil in grassland farming is also an important question. Almost all the farmers are aware of this and uses good <b>tire</b> <b>equipment</b> and drives during good weather conditions. The loss after storage can only be measured after storage through weighing. These farmers who does that means that the loss is between 10 to 20 %. The yield of the grassland is very interesting and fluctuates between 5. 5 – 15 ton per hectare. This depends of the location of the farms, how it weighs, measures and estimates. Every farm have their specific condition so the farmer have to adjust after that...|$|E
