40|$|JBIG 2 {{is a new}} {{standard}} for lossy and lossless compression of bi-level images. It exploits model-based coding for text and halftones; as well as nearby neighbor based coding for generic bi-level images. It can achieve compression ratios of up to three times those of existing standards for lossless textual image compression. BIG 2 also allows loss to be introduced while maintaining "visually lossless " quality for textual images, for which it can yield compression ratios of up to eight times those of existing standards. It produces even greater compression ratios when exploiting similarities between multiple pages and efficiently codes and integrates both scanned and generated bi-level images. JBIG 2 was developed for applications having widely differing requirements such as facsimile, document storage and archiving, Web image coding, wireless data <b>transmission,</b> <b>print</b> spooling, and even teleconferencing. Accordingly, JBIG 2 is structured as a "toolkit " of alternate capabilities to be selected based on the requirements of such application...|$|E

40|$|While music {{researchers}} {{are interested in}} developing tools for automatically culling related melodies and psychologists seek {{a clearer understanding of}} how people learn, recognize, and remember melodies, musicological and ethnomusicological studies offer numerous studies of tune families. Tune families cohere, it seems, partly on the basis of cultural agreement. Melodies seem to be similar if people say they are. Are there particular musical characteristics which are favored in the formation and cohesion of family members? Music scholars have been investigating this question for a half century. As their investigations have accrued, respect for complexity of melody and the many ways in which two melodies can be the same or different has increased proportionally. This study examines five tune families and evaluates selected members of each according to a previously proposed cognitive-distance measure. Concordances and cases of musical divergence in the context of claimed relatedness are evaluated in relation to collection-formation types, melodic types, and <b>transmission</b> methods (<b>printed,</b> oral, both). Neither hand-picked members of families nor those culled by title preservation necessarily show a high degree of musical coherence. However, among the families chosen, the predominance of pieces originally associated with dancing is conspicuous.

The monopole radiating element has a rectangular shape with two slots cut from each corner. In addition, the sides of the radiator, except that of the feed line direction, have been modified to be in the form of Koch fractal curve of third iteration. A small rectangular slot has been made in the ground plane beneath the feed line. The antenna has been fed with an offset 50 Ohm microstrip transmission line. Both the antenna and the feed line have been printed on an FR- 4 substrate with a thickness of 1. 59 mm and relative permittivity of 4. 4. Modeling and performance evaluation of the proposed antenna have been carried out using a method of finite integration technique (FIT) based EM simulator, CST Microwave Studio.

Op-timizing the PSC geometries to maximize the power transfer effi-ciency of the wireless link is imperative {{to reduce the size of}} the external energy source, heating of the tissue, and interference with other devices. Implantable devices need to be hermetically sealed in biocompatible materials and placed in a conductive environment with high permittivity (tissue), which can affect the PSC charac-teristics. We have constructed a detailed model that includes the effects of the surrounding environment on the PSC parasitic com-ponents and eventually on the power transfer efficiency. We have combined this model with an iterative design method that starts with a set of realistic design constraints and ends with the optimal PSC geometries. We applied our design methodology to optimize the wireless link of a 1 -cm implantable device example, operating at 13. 56 MHz. Measurement results showed that optimized PSC pairs, coated with 0. 3 mm of silicone, achieved 72. 2 %, 51. 8 %, and 30. 8 % efficiencies at a face-to-face relative distance of 10 mm in air, saline, and muscle, respectively. The PSC, which was optimized for air, could only bear 40. 8 % and 21. 8 % efficiencies in saline and muscle, respectively, showing that by including the PSC tissue en-vironment in the design process the result can be more than a 9 % improvement in the power transfer efficiency.
