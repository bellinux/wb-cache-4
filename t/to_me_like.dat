Lincoln retorted that it was [...] "becoming a running joke that people arrive on set ready for the day and then they are battered and beaten up by the weather." [...] Despite such assertions, he opined that it added to the episode's overall emotion. [...] "There's a lot of hard-earned sweat on camera.

500|$|After marrying Sara Fricker {{in autumn}} 1795, Coleridge left their home at Clevedon {{and began to}} travel {{throughout}} England {{in order to meet}} with various philosophers and political theorists. In part, he was trying to meet with people so he could raise subscriptions for his various works. During this time, he would write home constantly to his pregnant wife and was concerned about her state of health. His feelings of guilt, along with a fever that he treated with laudanum, affected him greatly and caused him to express these feelings in a letter to Josiah Wade on 10 February 1796: [...] "My past life seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a dream, a feverish dream! all one gloomy huddle of strange actions, and dim-discovered motives!

500|$|The investors {{showed little}} {{interest}} in Tesla's ideas for new types of alternating current motors and electrical transmission equipment. After the utility was up and running in 1886, they decided that the manufacturing {{side of the business}} was too competitive and opted to simply run an electric utility. They formed a new utility company, abandoning Tesla's company and leaving the inventor penniless. Tesla even lost control of the patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in exchange for stock. He had to work at various electrical repair jobs and as a ditch digger for $2 per day. Later in life Tesla would recount that part of 1886 as a time of hardship, writing [...] "My high education in various branches of science, mechanics and literature seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a mockery".|$|E
500|$|Symeon {{repeatedly}} {{describes the}} experience of divine light in his writings, as both an inward and outward mystical experience. These experiences began in his youth, and continued all during his life. They came to him during inward prayer and contemplation, and were associated {{with a feeling of}} indescribable joy, as well as the intellectual understanding that the light was a vision of God. In his writings, he spoke directly to God about the experience variously as [...] "the pure Light of your face" [...] and [...] "You deigned to reveal Your face <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> a formless sun." [...] He also described the light as the grace of God, and taught that its experience was associated with a mind that was completely still and had transcended itself. At times he described the light speaking to him with kindness, and explaining who it was.|$|E

Of Bacary Sagna's move from Arsenal to Manchester City in the summer, Wenger told reporters: [...] "I made him a proposal to stay for three years, but he chose them. Had he chosen a long time ago?

[...] The following day, he {{was committed to}} the UCLA Medical Center with hallucinations and paranoia. Contrary to what early reports said, however, West was not actually {{taken to the hospital}} involuntarily; he was persuaded to do so by authorities.

In a departure from series routine, Gervais and Merchant were not present on set for much of filming, though episode writers had typically been available in the past. Actress Kate Flannery found the episode [...] "a {{lot of fun to}} shoot," [...] and observed that on the occasions Gervais was present, [...] "it seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> he is looking at all of us with a sense of, 'I can't believe that this exists because of me.' That is just my interpretation, but he seems so humble, and kind of reverent."

500|$|After {{playing for}} England in the Tri-series in Australia {{at the start}} of the year, Buttler was once again {{involved}} with England at an international tournament, playing in the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Later in the English winter he was called back into the Test side as first choice Test wicket-keeper during the tour of the West Indies. He continued in the role throughout the English summer, playing both Tests against New Zealand and all five Ashes Tests against Australia. Buttler's batting during the Ashes series was criticised by Boycott, saying [...] "Jos Buttler is like a rabbit caught in the headlights of Ashes cricket. A seven-year-old schoolboy would have played better. He hasn't made a run all series. He hasn't shown any application whatsoever. It looks <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> his mind and confidence is shot for Test cricket – it's pathetic."

500|$|Gallagher was {{encouraged}} to take up cycling by Victorian Institute of Sport coach Glenn Doney. The decision to transfer to cycling was made easier after her favourite athletics event, the long jump, was not included on the 2016 Rio Paralympics athletics program. Gallagher believes that track cycling is easier than downhill skiing. She said: [...] "Being a skier, the guide is not connected <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>like</b> on a tandem and so I need to ski at high speeds under incredibly intense variabilities that constantly change. The velodrome is a stable environment." [...] At the 2016 UCI Para-cycling Track World Championships in Montichiari, Italy, Gallagher and her pilot Madison Janssen made their international debut. They {{won the gold medal}} in the Women's Sprint B in world record time and the bronze in the Women's 1km Time Trial B. In September 2016, she became the first Australian to medal in both the Summer and Winter Paralympics when she won a bronze medal in the Women’s B/VI 1000m time trial at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro with Janssen. They finished ninth in the Women's individual pursuit B.|$|E
500|$|Actor Henry Ian Cusick {{and actress}} Georgina Haig guest {{starred in the}} episode {{as a pair of}} Federal agents. Cusick had worked with co-creator J.J.

Cusick stated that most of his scenes were filmed with Haig and John Noble (Walter Bishop), and that the story leaves a possibility for the return of their characters in the future. Noble found it unusual to film an episode that did not involve the lead actors. He explained, [...] "That was Walter with two really big, important guest stars, Henry Ian Cusick and Georgina Haig. It felt, <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>like</b> it was a really strong episode. The two guest actors did a fantastic job, which is not easy to do, to step into an established company. It is out of the box and is somewhere else completely. I think that the fans will love it. Some fans of this type of material will like it anyway because Henry Ian Cusick was such a big star in Lost, but also, this new girl is just full of wonderful energy, too." ...|$|E
