25|$|Ichthyosaurs {{became even}} more popular in 1854 by the {{rebuilding}} at Sydenham Hill of the Crystal Palace, originally erected at the world exhibition of 1851. In the surrounding park, life-sized, painted, concrete statues of extinct animals were placed, which were designed by Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins {{under the direction of}} Richard Owen. Among them were three models of an ichthyosaur. Although it was known that ichthyosaurs had been animals of the open seas, they were shown basking on the shore, a convention followed by many nineteenth century illustrations with the aim, as Conybeare once explained, of better exposing their build. This led to the misunderstanding <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> had an amphibious lifestyle. The pools in the park were at the time subjected to tidal changes, so that fluctuations in the water level at intervals submerged the ichthyosaur statues, adding a certain realism. Remarkably, internal skeletal structures, such as the scleral rings and the many phalanges of the flippers, were shown at the outside.|$|E
500|$|Crawford starred as Blanche Hudson, an old, wheelchair-bound former A-list {{movie star}} {{who lives in}} fear of her {{psychotic}} sister Jane, in the highly successful psychological thriller What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962). Despite the actresses' earlier tensions, Crawford reportedly suggested Bette Davis {{for the role of}} Jane. The two stars maintained publicly that there was no feud between them. The director, Robert Aldrich, explained that Davis and Crawford were each aware of how important the film was to their respective careers and commented, [...] "It's proper to say <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> detested each other, but they behaved absolutely perfectly." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1983, {{the cousins}} {{admitted}} {{in an article}} published in the magazine The Unexplained that the photographs had been faked, although both maintained <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> had seen fairies. Elsie had copied illustrations of dancing girls from a popular children's book of the time, Princess Mary's Gift Book, published in 1914, and drew wings on them. They said they had then cut out the cardboard figures and supported them with hatpins, disposing of their props in the beck once the photograph had been taken. But the cousins disagreed about the fifth and final photograph, which Doyle in his The Coming of the Fairies described in this way: ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to the film's 2008 release, Hayden Christensen {{reflected}} {{on the possibility of}} one or more sequels: [...] "This has definitely been set up {{in a way that will}} allow for more films, and Doug has been careful to make sure that he's created characters that will have room to grow." [...] Lucas Foster during production of the film stated in an interview: [...] "The ideas got so large, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> couldn't fit into, you know, one or two movies, they needed to evolve over at least three movies. So we planned the story out over three movies and then we sliced it up in such a way as to leave room for the other two movies." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2013, it was {{announced}} that Levine would be entering a partnership with Sears Holdings to launch a multi-department lifestyle brand to develop apparel and accessories collections. The company, which owns Kmart and ShopYourWay, a shopping social platform, also included rapper Nicki Minaj in the same contract. The menswear collection was launched on October 1 that year and conducts business via 500 Kmart stores across the US, as well as online. In an official statement, Levine said: [...] "Partnering with ShopYourWay to develop this line was an exciting opportunity for me and I am really looking forward to diving into the process of designing an apparel and accessory collection". In an interview with People, he commented further, [...] "it was cool <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> promoted creative control. I like to be involved with process rather than just phoning it in".|$|E

500|$|Writing in 1954, part {{way through}} {{proofreading}} The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien claimed the Elvish language Sindarin has a [...] character very like British-Welsh [...] "because {{it seems to}} fit the rather 'Celtic' type of legends and stories told of its speakers". In the same letter, Tolkien {{goes on to say}} that the elves had very little in common with elves or fairies of Europe, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> represent men with greater artistic ability, beauty and a longer life span. Tolkien also notes an Elven bloodline was the only real claim to 'nobility' that the Men of Middle-earth can have. Tolkien also wrote that the elves are primarily to blame for many of the ills of Middle-earth in The Lord of the Rings, having independently created the Three Rings in order to stop their domains in mortal-lands from 'fading' and attempting to prevent inevitable change and new growth.|$|E
500|$|Amidst these drastic changes, large {{proportions}} of the freshmen classes (some as high as 30%) contained all-state high school band members. As the band's experience and musical talents grew, {{the quality of the}} music improved dramatically. Haney even rewrote the drills to include a portion where the band stopped moving and played to the audience. This innovation was well received and became a staple of the band's repertoire. In 1975, at a televised game versus the University of Arkansas, the Aggie Band was repeatedly asked to play music during lulls in the game. By the fourth quarter, the Aggie Band had played on TV during every break and Colonel Haney, trying his best to be fair, told the cameraman <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> should let the Razorback Band play a little too. The cameraman called up to the broadcast booth to get guidance and then replied, [...] "The director doesn't want to hear the Arkansas band, he wants to hear the Aggie Band." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{review by}} John Ferriar in the October 1805 Monthly Review argued, [...] "It {{has fallen to}} the lot of this writer to puzzle our {{critical}} discernment more than once [...] He has no contrived to manufacture a large quarto, which he has styled a poem, but of what description it is no easy matter to decide [...] The poem of Madoc is not didactic, nor elegiac, nor classical, in any respect [...] Respecting the manners, Mr. Southey {{appears to have been}} more successful than in his choice of the story. He has adhered to history where he could discover any facts adapted to his purpose; and when history failed him, he has had resource to probability." [...] Ferriar continued with an attack on the Welsh names that appear within the poem: [...] "we own that the nomenclature of his heroes has shocked what Mr. S. would call our prejudices. Georvyl and Rird and Rodri and Llaian may have charms for Cambrian ears, but who can feel an interest in Tezozomoc, Tlalala, or Ocelopan [...] how could we swallow Yuhidthiton, Coanocotzin, and, above all, the yawnings jaw-dislocating Ayayaca?—These torturing words, particularly the latter, remind us so strongly of the odious cacophony of the Nurse and Child, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> are not to be tolerated." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Trial of Elizabeth Gadge" [...] {{was written}} to mimic genuine witch trials, some {{transcripts}} of which Pemberton and Shearsmith had read {{as part of}} the writing process. The fixation of the characters on [...] "teats" [...] and [...] "suckling", for instance, was something Shearsmith had seen in authentic trials. One writing challenge concerned the need for new information to be revealed with each of the trial's witnesses; this is what shaped the structure of the script. For Shearsmith, given that the trials were already absurd, they cannot be parodied. The humour of the episode, for him, comes precisely {{from the fact that the}} characters take the events so seriously, and do not see this absurdity. Pemberton said that the pair aimed for authenticity, and did not seek to produce a spoof of a period piece. To that end, he was complimentary of Yves Barr, a costume designer with whom the writers had worked for a number of years, who did [...] "a fantastic job creating this period on a shoestring". Given that, in his view, [...] "people don't do this period", Shearsmith was excited to film something set in the 17th century. The episode was the only period piece in the first two series, but the writers expressed willingness to do another; they felt that the setting showed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> could go anywhere with the programme.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Dark Horizons, Yates said that [...] "I was still working on Order of the Phoenix when {{they asked me to}} do Half-Blood Prince. So they were really delighted with the material that they were seeing while we were in post-production, and the conversations happened before the movie was released, because I had to start pre-production on it while Order of the Phoenix was being promoted. It was just something they see in the work <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> liked, and responded to." [...] Yates described Half-Blood Prince as being [...] "a cross between the chills of Prisoner of Azkaban and the fantastical adventure of Goblet of Fire." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{response}} {{to this kind of}} criticism is to argue that no inconsistencies exist.

Barton states that [...] "this is not the Bible that we have in fact got". He also points out that Judaism understands that texts [...] "may sometimes be in dialogue with each other" [...] and [...] "something positive may emerge from a kind of creative tension".|$|E
5000|$|Afaf Lutfi Sayyid-Marsot {{contends that}} under Baring, Egyptian nationalists were inert and many Egyptians {{believed}} in Britain's policy of [...] "rescue and retire", but that Baring {{had no intention}} of doing so as, Marsot says, [...] "Baring believed that 'subject races' were totally incapable of self-government, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did not <b>really</b> need or want self-government, and <b>that</b> what <b>they</b> <b>really</b> needed was a 'full belly' policy which kept it quiescent and allowed the elite to make money and so cooperate with the occupying power." ...|$|R

2500|$|When researching his {{ethnography}} of whites, Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America, scholar Rich Benjamin kept a notepad {{while traveling}} the Pacific Northwest. [...] "I remember driving through swaths of Washington and Oregon and {{seeing a lot}} of Confederate flags," [...] Benjamin explained to journalist Matthew Novak. [...] "There are a lot of refugees from the South who seem attracted to Oregon not because they're racists, but because Oregon has a racial homogeneity and a conservatism and a gun culture <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>really</b> appreciate." [...] The Pacific Northwest offers a cultural collision between the confederate flag, other emblems of racism, and its new technological profit hubs.|$|E
