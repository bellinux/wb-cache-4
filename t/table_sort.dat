50|$|Marzullo's {{algorithm}} is efficient in both space and time. The asymptotic space usage is O(n), where n {{is the number}} of sources. In considering the asymptotic time requirement the algorithm can be considered to consist of building the <b>table,</b> <b>sorting</b> it and searching it. Sorting can be done in O(n log n) time, and this dominates the building and searching phases which can be performed in linear time. Therefore, the time efficiency of Marzullo's {{algorithm is}} O(n log n).|$|R
