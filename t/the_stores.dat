40|$|In {{domestic}} {{hot water}} <b>stores</b> <b>the</b> preservation of hot water layers {{is essential for the}} effective operation. Such stores are operated intermittently: when hot water is taken from <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> cold water is fed into it, so that part of the water in <b>the</b> <b>store</b> is hot and part of it is cold. These two parts should not mix, because this would deteriorate the efficiency of <b>the</b> <b>store.</b> When mixing occurs between the hot and cold parts, the hot water temperature is decreased. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>store</b> has, to be heated to a temperature above the needed temperature from the very beginning. With higher temperature, heat losses are also larger. More heat has to be fed into <b>the</b> mixed <b>store</b> than into <b>the</b> stratified when the same amount of heat shall be taken out with the same amount of water. Consequently, <b>the</b> energetic <b>store</b> efficiency as <b>the</b> ratio of heat taken from <b>the</b> <b>store</b> to heat fed into <b>the</b> <b>store</b> is less when <b>the</b> <b>store</b> temperature is higher. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>store</b> with no mixing is <b>the</b> best <b>store...</b>|$|R

5|$|Tensions mounted {{over the}} {{following}} week as sit-in demonstrations spread to other cities and race riots broke out in nearby Chattanooga. On February 27, the Nashville student activists held a fourth sit-in at the Woolworths, McClellan, and Walgreens stores. Crowds of white youths again gathered in <b>the</b> <b>stores</b> to taunt and harass the demonstrators. This time, however, police were not present. Eventually, several of the sit-in demonstrators were attacked by hecklers in the McClellan and Woolworths stores. Some were pulled from their seats and beaten, and one demonstrator was pushed {{down a flight of}} stairs. When police arrived, the white attackers fled and none were arrested. Police then ordered the demonstrators at all three locations to leave <b>the</b> <b>stores.</b> When the demonstrators refused to leave, they were arrested and loaded into police vehicles as onlookers applauded. Eighty-one students were arrested and charged with loitering and disorderly conduct.|$|E
5|$|The first {{large-scale}} organized sit-in was on Saturday, February 13, 1960. At about 12:30 pm, 124 students, {{most of them}} black, {{walked into}} the downtown Woolworths, S. H.

5|$|When Mackintosh and the depot-laying party {{finally reached}} Cape Evans in mid-June, {{they learned that}} Aurora, with 18 men on board and {{carrying}} most of the shore party's supplies and equipment, had broken loose from its winter mooring during a gale. Ice conditions in McMurdo Sound {{made it impossible for}} the ship to return; the shore party of ten was effectively marooned, with drastically depleted resources. However, most of <b>the</b> <b>stores</b> required for the depots had been landed. Mackintosh therefore resolved that the following season's work would be carried out to the full: depots would be laid across the Great ice Barrier {{all the way to the}} Beardmore Glacier. The party would seek to make up its lack of supplies and equipment by salvaging <b>the</b> <b>stores</b> left by earlier expeditions, particularly from Captain Scott's recent sojourn at Cape Evans. The entire party pledged its support to this effort, though it would require, wrote Mackintosh, a record-breaking feat of polar travel to accomplish it. However, the long months of preparation were difficult for Mackintosh. The only officer in the party, he found it hard to form close relationships with his companions. His position became increasingly isolated, and subject to the frequent vocal criticisms of Joyce in particular.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the unique}} aspects of retail {{promotions}} is that two brands are often involved; <b>the</b> <b>store</b> brand and <b>the</b> brands {{that make up the}} retailer's product range. Retail promotions that focus on <b>the</b> <b>store</b> tend to be ‘image’ oriented, raising awareness of <b>the</b> <b>store</b> and creating a positive attitude towards <b>the</b> <b>store</b> and its services. Retail promotions that focus on the product range, are designed to cultivate a positive attitude to the brands stocked by <b>the</b> <b>store,</b> in order to indirectly encourage favourable attitudes towards <b>the</b> <b>store</b> itself. [...] Some retail advertising and promotion is partially or wholly funded by brands and this is known as co-operative (or co-op) advertising.|$|R
5|$|A {{series of}} {{meetings}} involving Wooten, Barbey, Edmund Herring (Wooten's superior as commander of I Corps), Colonel Merian C. Cooper from the Fifth Air Force, and Air Commodore Joe Hewitt from the RAAF, reached agreement, or at least compromise, on many points. Wooten wanted at least 10 days' reserve rations. This meant that some stores {{would have to be}} transported in bulk, and not pre-loaded on trucks as Barbey initially wanted. Loading <b>the</b> <b>stores</b> onto trucks was an inefficient use of shipping space, but permitted quick unloading of the LSTs, as the trucks could simply be driven off. The 9th Division did not have sufficient trucks for this, but 200 trucks earmarked for the US Advanced Base at Lae were borrowed from USASOS. Barbey would not allow loaded vehicles on the tank decks of the LSTs, as this was a fire hazard, so bulk stores were carried there instead.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Honigsberger <b>Store</b> is a {{historic}} building located at 665 Main St. in Copperopolis, California. Businessman L. Honigsberger built <b>the</b> <b>store</b> in 1865, replacing <b>the</b> original <b>store</b> he built in 1861. The brick building was designed in the Neoclassical style. <b>The</b> <b>store</b> served Copperopolis during its first copper boom in the 1860s; however, an 1867 fire and declining copper production caused Copperopolis to lose most of its population and severely diminished <b>the</b> <b>store's</b> business. In 1905, the Honigsberger family sold <b>the</b> <b>store</b> to <b>the</b> Union Copper Mining Company, which became the Calaveras Copper Mining Company four years later. The company used <b>the</b> <b>store</b> as a warehouse during another copper boom in Copperopolis from 1909 to 1929. <b>The</b> <b>store</b> {{is one of only}} four extant buildings from Copperopolis' first copper boom in the 1860s.|$|R

Electronic tills produced daily customer counts, inventories and profit and loss statements, so that problems could be identified quickly. KFC expanded internationally in the 1970s and 80s, particularly in Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom. Miles also lured Sanders back, and listened to his recommendations for the business.

5|$|In 1798 Baker {{received}} a third official appointment, as government storekeeper for the Hawkesbury region {{in addition to}} his equivalent duties in Parramatta. Despite his past experience, Baker was quickly found wanting in the management of <b>the</b> <b>stores,</b> specifically those for farmers near the settlement of Windsor. In 1798 the local grain harvest was too large to be receipted and stored in the Windsor storehouse, so Baker elected to fill that store solely with produce supplied by the region's three largest landholders. In consequence, smaller farmers at Windsor had no means of selling or storing their grain and were brought close to bankruptcy. Baker was deaf to their complaints, and Governor Hunter was forced to intervene in person to keep the peace. In a letter on 19 April, sent via the New South Wales Corps commander in Hawkesbury, Hunter directed Baker to return half of the harvest he had already stored, and instead fill the storehouse with goods from smaller farms.|$|E
