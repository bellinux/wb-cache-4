For modelling of a specific application, the field of vehicle telematics has been chosen. The thesis consists of two series of simulations performed in Opnet Modeler network simulator. The first theoretic part gave an overview of protocols used in converged networks, with a more detailed description of routing protocols. The attention also centred on the mechanisms for assuring the quality of service in IP. The subsequent practical part consisted in creating the simulation of a converged <b>telematic</b> <b>network</b> in Opnet Modeler network simulator, configuration of scenarios for assuring QoS using RSVP and DSCP protocols and the simulation itself. The results of the simulations for both scenarios were compared and represented in graphic form.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the rationale and methods for a European project (EFCOSUM) {{to develop a}} method for a European food consumption survey that delivers internationally comparable data {{on a set of}} policy-relevant nutritional indicators. Rationale and methods: Currently Member States are collecting data and information for use at national level. At an international level, such data are often of limited comparability and of varying quality. To promote the development and exchange of adequate, reliable and comparable indicators of public health, and the structures needed to exchange the relevant data, a programme of Community action on health monitoring was set up for the EU. The objective of the action programme is to contribute to the establishment of a Community Health Monitoring System. Data will be made available to all Member States via a <b>telematic</b> <b>network,</b> which is currently being developed for the Health Monitoring Programme. With regard to nutrition, {{there is a need for}} a limited set of policy-relevant dietary indicators that are comparable among EU Member States. In the field of nutrition, however, there is a regrettable lack of internationally comparable data. The project 'European Food Consumption Survey Method' (EFCOSUM) therefore aimed to define a (minimum) set of dietary components which are relevant determinants of health and to define a method for the monitoring of food consumption in nationally representative samples of all age-sex categories in Europe in a comparable way. The project was carried out by 14 Member States as well as nine other European countries. Activities of the project included plenary sessions, desk research, and working group activities, building on existing experience from such projects as DAFNE, EPIC, FLAIR Eurofoods-Enfant project, COST Action 99 and others. The proposed method may be used alone, or as a calibration method to accompany existing ongoing studies.

40|$|Background: Chronic {{diseases}} {{stand for}} a major public health problem, being {{the leading cause of}} death in developed countries. Their increase has led to the re-organization of the healthcare systems aimed at characterizing the hospitals as a place for the treatment of acute patients and implementing the chronic care model in many countries of the world. Nevertheless, the success of liver transplantation together with limited human and infrastructural resources have caused an increasing difficulty in dealing with post transplant management both in routine and urgency. These factors call for a management network able to ensure effective continuity of care for patient needs in the post-transplant period. Materials and methods: An observational study of prevalence has been carried out with the primary objective to evaluate patients’ needs and criticalities both in the routine daily life and in urgency in the post-transplant period and the capacity of the regional health system to support them. A survey, using a semi-structured questionnaire consisting of 30 questions, was administered to all patients residents in Tuscany, transplanted from 2000 to 2010. The survey tool assessed the followings: socio-demographic data, personal, family and social difficulties, problems emerged in the clinical routine and urgency, resolution modality, relationships with the general practitioner and the referral specialist, services the patients would appreciate to receive in their province of residence. Results: 346 patients were matching the inclusion criteria of the study, 324 gave a telephone consent to participate to the survey and 225 responded (69. 4 %). The major occurred difficulties were: depression (39. 5 %), difficulty in returning to work (29. 3 %), low income (22. 6 %), lack of self-sufficiency (22. 6 %), addictions (19, 1 %) (tabagism 16. 4 %), 12. 4 % eating disorders, 18, 9 % others (social isolation, absence of a family network, etc [...] ). The main reasons for dissatisfaction were: difficulty to obtain the required labs tests, lack of a reference structure at the local health facility. Few patients have a referral specialists in their area and most of them primarily refer to the Transplant Center even later after the procedure. Discussion: An integrated management network between the Transplant Center and the local facilities (hospitals, general practitioners, first aids, centralized laboratories) should be implemented with the support of a <b>telematic</b> <b>network</b> in order to guarantee a direct communication system among facilities. Screening tests for some risk factors (depression, addiction, eating disorders) and services such as counselling, dietary support, rehabilitation and social services should be implemented locally. The fundamental aspects of the service network should be focused on patient care through multidisciplinary teams management and shared plans based on risks assessment depending on the adherence degree and the health status. The network should ensure: continuity of care among the health facilities in Tuscany dealing with the follow-up care after OLT (both in routine and urgency), post-OLT complications control and appropriate use of resources. A pilot project on a small area will started to evaluate network costs and benefits. Subsequently, the project can be extended at regional and interregional level...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{document}} {{provides a}} general {{description of the}} telematic voting scenario designed by the author’s research group. This scenario reinforces verification procedures as key elements to achieve full acceptance of the system {{on the part of}} voters. To frame this work, a general overview of electronic voting is given and the conditions entailed by these systems are specified. 1 Problems inherent to telematic voting Since the first experiments in the 1960 's with computerized voting until today, in which electronic ballot boxes or Internet voting are being tested, the mass media highlighted a number of experiences around the world under the general concept of electronic voting. However, these experiments have involved diverse types of voting systems, where the security guarantees required in authentication processes, voting and tallying are provided in quite diverse forms. In [CGP 02] the authors propose a classification of voting systems into several levels of complexity. We can therefore identify two main groups that are relevant to our work: i) Systems that substitute one of the physical components of traditional voting procedures with some type of electronic process (i. e. Direct-Recording Electronic), and ii) those that use <b>telematic</b> <b>networks</b> to link voters to a remote polling station. For the last several years, nearly all governmental action designed to automate voting processes involve policies that fall within the first group, where the electronic ballot box, with or without a ballot, is the most commonly used device in all cases. The experiences of countries like Brazil [Re 04] and India [In 06] are noteworthy in this regard, particularly the latter, with its hundreds of millions of votes cast confirming the validity of this method. 3...|$|R

The algorithm is compared to more classical approach Random Midpoint Displacement showing at traffic generated is similar but can be generated continuously with no fixed block size. Second work presents two novel cloning schemes for video delivery in OBS networks that dramatically improve user perceived content quality. These schemes take into account the special characteristics of compressed video traffic. Analytical and simulation results show up to 40 % QoE improvement without a substantial increase in the overall network traffic and without increasing the number of bursts in the network. The results show the strong dependency of this novel cloning scheme on the video traffic structure due to the coding mechanisms.

The chapter also discusses the innovation policies that the regional government set up since 2001 in order to strengthen the collaboration among local economic actors, including universities and research centres. As mechanics is the most important regional industry, chapter 2 analyses the combination of knowledge and practices utilized in the period 1960 s- 1990 s in the design of a particular kind of machinery produced by G. D S. p. A., a world-leader in the market of tobacco packaging machines. G. D is based in Bologna, the region’s capital, and is at the centre of the most important Italian packaging district. In chapter 3 the attention turns to the institutional level, focusing on how the local public administrations, and the local, publicly-owned utility companies have dealt with the creation of new <b>telematic</b> <b>networks</b> on the regional territory during the 1990 s and 2000 s. Finally, chapter 4 assesses the technology transfer carried out by the main university of the region – the University of Bologna – by focusing on the patenting activities involving its research personnel in the period 1960 - 2010. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{events that}} led to the {{proclamation}} of the Reign of Italy in 1861, after the heroic actions by Garibaldi and the wise politics by Cavour, opened a new stage in Italian history. This is an important moment for a country that had always lived divisions among different political parties and had always been dominated by foreign rulers. The Italian state was created in an important historical period made of technical and economical development thanks to several technological inventions, such as textile machines, the train, the electrical telegraph. These inventions needed also a development in communications. Soon after the Unity of Italy the conditions of the last ones were considerably backward. From the physical geographical viewpoint, the distance between the two extremes of the peninsula, leaving out also the two main isles, was longer than that of all the other European Countries. Besides, just in the Po Valley and along few flat coast lines the relief conditions were suitable for building roads, railways and modern highways. Currently all that is clear: there a few stretches without flyovers, bridges, tunnels and viaducts, which have greatly contributed to transform the landscape (for example the link Genoa – Savona, belonging to highway Fiori – Genova/Ventimiglia – opened in 1967, includes 158 km built along the coast with 27 galleries and 90 viaducts). Historically the “entries of Italy” were the alpine passes and the ports on the coast. The “Belpaese” has been perhaps the most famous example of what the geographer Jean Gottmann called the “crossroads regions” (carrefours) with openings to the world which have given them great opportunities to connect and exchange. In the globalization age the new entries to the world are the international airports, while the <b>telematic</b> <b>networks</b> contribute {{to get rid of the}} idea of border itself. A journey to discover the thick and wide realization of communications and telecommunications works which, in different ways, have created “ the united and connected Italy”, with a huge effort being greater than the one of the other European Countries, for historical, geographical and urban planning reasons. Networks being fundamental not only for the economic growth and development, but also to build the national society and conscience...|$|R
