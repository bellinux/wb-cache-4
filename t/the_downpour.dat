5|$|In {{areas where}} the heavy {{rainfall}} {{is associated with a}} wind shift, the wet season is known as the monsoon. Rainfall in the wet season is mainly due to daytime heating which leads to diurnal thunderstorm activity within a pre-existing moist airmass, so the rain mainly falls in late afternoon and early evening in savannah and monsoon regions. Further, much of the total rainfall each day occurs in the first minutes of <b>the</b> <b>downpour,</b> before the storms mature into their stratiform stage. Most places have only one wet season, but areas of the tropics can have two wet seasons, because the monsoon trough, or Intertropical Convergence Zone, can pass over locations in the tropics twice per year. However, since rain forests have rainfall spread evenly through the year, {{they do not have a}} wet season.|$|E
5|$|Compton and Evans {{continued}} {{to resist the}} Australians on the final morning, the latter being the more aggressive, and proceedings were briefly interrupted by rain less than 30 minutes {{after the start of}} play. At the time, it appeared <b>the</b> <b>downpour</b> might cause the match to end in a draw. After half an hour of stoppages, play resumed and Evans attacked, hitting two fours in quick succession. England's wicket-keeper played Johnston and Johnson confidently, but Bradman nevertheless persisted in giving Compton easy singles in order to bring Evans on strike so he could be targeted. For his part, Compton thought his partner could be relied upon and accepted the runs gifted to him by the Australian captain, while Evans {{continued to}} attack the bowling. The batsmen appealed against the light after the first stoppage of the day, but were turned down. Australia took the new ball, but the home team's batsmen continued to proceed steadily, Evans being particularly aggressive. After a second interruption for poor light, this time for ten minutes, play resumed, and England had added a further 60 runs to their overnight total to reach 405/6.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to earn a}} {{good living}} in the village, Harihar travels {{to the city to}} seek a better job. He {{promises}} Sarbajaya that he will return with money to repair their dilapidated house. During his absence, the family sinks deeper into poverty. Sarbajaya grows increasingly lonely and bitter. One day during the monsoon season, Durga plays in <b>the</b> <b>downpour</b> for too long, catches a cold and develops a high fever. Adequate medical care being unavailable, the fever becomes worse, and on a night of incessant rain and gusty winds, she dies. Harihar returns home and starts to show Sarbajaya the merchandise he has brought from the city. Sarbajaya, who remains silent, breaks down at the feet of her husband, and Harihar cries out in grief as he discovers that he has lost his daughter. The family decide to leave their ancestral home. As they start packing, Apu finds the necklace that Durga had earlier denied stealing; he throws it into a pond. Apu and his parents leave the village on an ox-cart.|$|E

25|$|The {{portions}} where Mike Shinoda raps first {{take place}} in a wasteland with thorny vines sprouting out of the ground, surrounding him and shattering into dust, (first verse) and then grass and plants sprouting up around him (second verse). During the time Mike raps his verses, Chester stands atop a platform with gargoyles on the edges. This platform is in front of a door {{in the shape of a}} trapezoid. Near the end of the video, the skies turn dark and it begins to rain, and the band performs in <b>the</b> <b>downpour</b> until the end of the song, where the rain stops and the camera pans away from the tower, showing the wasteland where Shinoda had rapped in is now a lush Greenland. During the rain the statues on the tower begin to move.|$|E
25|$|On the 16th, {{warm air}} picking up {{moisture}} – due to residual {{heat from the}} Atlantic Ocean – travelled towards the South West Cornish coast as prevailing winds. Upon contact with the topographically vertical coast, these winds experienced a strong up-drafting force thus causing internal moisture to reach the atmosphere, and consequently cool as a string of storm clouds. With convergence and coalescence, enhanced moisture levels resulted in heavy rainfall {{on the afternoon of}} 16 August 2004. 185mm (7inches) of rain fell over the high ground just inland of Boscastle. At the peak of <b>the</b> <b>downpour,</b> at about 15:40 GMT, 24.1mm of rain (almost one inch) was recorded as falling in just 15 minutes at Lesnewth, 2.5 miles (4km) up the valley from Boscastle. In Boscastle, 89mm (3.5inches) of rain was recorded in 60 minutes. The rain was very localised: Otterham and Lesnewth, both a few miles inland from Boscastle, recorded 24 hour totals of 200mm and 185mm respectively on the day, whereas four of the nearest 10 rain gauges showed less than 3mm of rain in the same period. The cause of the very heavy localised rain is thought to be an extreme example of what has become known as the Brown Willy effect.|$|E

[...] In 1994, The Oregonian reported that O'Donnell regarded Weather Machine with a [...] "mixture of wonder and embarrassment" [...] and stated that he [...] " [...] think it's all that attractive". The publication's Vivian McInerny said of O'Donnell and the machine: [...] "Practical people may wonder why the square needs such a silly weather machine when a glance out the window works as well[...] [...] And these practical people may be the very ones who make the world go 'round. But it is the less practical people, the dreamers like O'Donnell, who make it worth going 'round." ...|$|E

Winters are generally milder {{than in the}} northern part of the Drôme and in the Ardèche but cooler than in Provence where the difference is two to three degrees Celsius on average. Temperatures can thus be very hot in summer and <b>the</b> <b>downpours</b> brutal, <b>the</b> Tricastin valley being located as it is between the Cévennes Piedmont (in the Gard and Ardèche departments) and the town of Nyons in the Baronnies (Drôme and Vaucluse).|$|R
50|$|Originally planned as a one-off event, it was {{scheduled}} for 24 September 1988, but Jarre and his crew had to battle constantly with Newham Council and London Fire Brigade over logistical and safety concerns. Although the organisers publicly sought other venues in the meantime, a compromise was reached in which the event was split into two concerts to spread the crowds over two nights. These concerts went ahead on 8 and 9 October 1988. Weather throughout the buildup to the event was extremely rainy, and while the first concert narrowly avoided <b>the</b> <b>downpours,</b> much of <b>the</b> second took place in heavy rain.|$|R

500|$|Due to the narrowness no man's {{land and}} the harsh winter weather, many {{casualties}} were anticipated during the embarkation. The untenable nature of the Allied position was made apparent by a heavy rainstorm on 26 November 1915. <b>The</b> <b>downpour</b> at Suvla lasted {{for three days and}} there was a blizzard in early December. Rain flooded trenches, drowned soldiers and washed unburied corpses into the lines; the following snow killed still more men from exposure. Suvla and Anzac were to be evacuated in late December, the last troops leaving before dawn on 20 December. Troop numbers had been slowly reduced since 7 December and ruses, such as William Scurry's self-firing rifle, which had been rigged to fire by water dripped into a pan attached to the trigger, were used to disguise the Allied departure. At Anzac Cove, troops maintained silence for an hour or more, until curious Ottoman troops ventured to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs opened fire. A mine was detonated at the Nek which killed [...] soldiers. The Allied force was embarked, with the Australians suffering no casualties on the final night but large quantities of supplies and stores fell into Ottoman hands.|$|E
500|$|American {{singer and}} {{musician}} Prince {{performed in the}} halftime show. The setlist for Prince's performance was a short rendition of [...] "We Will Rock You" [...] by Queen, his signature hit [...] "Let's Go Crazy", [...] "Baby, I'm a Star", cover versions of the Creedence Clearwater Revival hit [...] "Proud Mary", the Bob Dylan composition [...] "All Along the Watchtower", and the Foo Fighters song [...] "Best of You", and {{in light of the}} conditions, he fittingly finished the performance with another signature song, [...] "Purple Rain" [...] in <b>the</b> <b>downpour.</b> The 12-minute performance featured Prince accompanied by two dancers he calls [...] "The Twinz" [...] and the Florida A University marching band, the Marching 100. Prince had rehearsed with the drum line for a week before the performance. [...] The performance was on a large, central stage which was shaped after the artist's logo, and was outlined with lights. He played before 74,512 fans at Dolphin Stadium (who had been given flashlights to point at the stage during the performance of Purple Rain). The event was carried [...] "to the biggest audience of his life – 140 million television viewers." [...] Overall, the show was energetic and quite well received by the rain-soaked audience surrounding the stage. Music critics were extremely enthusiastic about his performance, one calling it [...] "arguably the best halftime show in Super Bowl history", and others saying {{it was one of the}} best ever.|$|E
500|$|Bono {{informed}} the fans waiting outside the venue {{that the show}} would be general admission, and told everyone to get {{as close to the}} stage as possible, regardless of the seating assignment on their tickets. Fey wanted to cancel the show but was flying to Denver from the US Festival in California with Morris when the decision to continue was made. After arriving in Denver, Fey called the amphitheatre asking to where the concert was being moved, unaware that the band had decided to proceed with the show. Guitarist the Edge said that when Fey learned of the group's decision, he could not believe it. The Edge said, [...] "I don't think he'd ever heard anything quite so crazy in his life, going on with an outdoor show in the worst kind of weather, rain and wind in the mountains. He thought we'd lost our minds completely." [...] Bono went on the radio that day to confirm that the Red Rocks concert was still taking place, and to promote a concert that the band planned for the following night at the CU Events Center to accommodate fans who were unable to attend the Red Rocks show. Clayton said during the band's radio interviews, [...] "We know it's raining now but we're sure it won't be when the show starts, so please come." [...] Two hours before the concert, <b>the</b> <b>downpour</b> subsided and settled into a misty drizzle. The 9,000-person venue had sold out, but because of the inclement weather, only about 4,400 fans attended.|$|E

Also in the state, four rivers overflowed their banks; one river received 51 in {{of excess}} water in a single day. Low-lying areas, such as grasslands and pastures, experienced major flooding, prompting farmers to evacuate their livestock. In Villahermosa, <b>the</b> <b>downpours</b> resulted in <b>the</b> collapse of water drains, flooding many streets and stranding cars. Across Guerrero, three people were initially reported missing, but all three were later found. Twenty-thousand residents were advised to evacuated due to rising floodwaters.

500|$|Arsenal faced West Ham United in {{the first}} weekend of October. Dixon, Nigel Winterburn and Overmars were rested for the match, {{replaced}} by Oleh Luzhny, Slyvinho and Davor Šuker. In spite of general dominance from Arsenal, West Ham striker Paolo di Canio scored in each half to win his team the match. Patrick Vieira was dismissed during play for a foul on Di Canio. A confrontation soon after occurred between the player and Neil Ruddock. Vieira was subsequently charged, banned for six matches and fined a record £45,000 by The Football Association. Šuker scored twice against Everton at Highbury on 16 October 1999. Arsenal then travelled to Stamford Bridge to face Chelsea. Goals from Tore André Flo and Dan Petrescu seemed to have given the home side victory, before Kanu scored a hat-trick {{in the space of}} 15 minutes. His first involved extending his legs and stabbing the ball past goalkeeper Ed de Goey, once it fell kindly in his direction. The equaliser came in the 83rd minute: Kanu received the ball from Overmars, which took him away from goal but hit the ball to the left of De Goey’s dive. In injury time Kanu, in <b>the</b> <b>downpour,</b> chased down the ball and dribbled past the stranded Chelsea goalkeeper on the byline, before curling the ball over Frank Leboeuf and into {{the far corner of the}} goal net. Kanu's teammate Šuker described the third goal as [...] "beautiful", while Bergkamp added: [...] "The skills he has got, the moves he makes, are something you like to watch and learn from. I watch him in training and it is a joy." [...] The month ended with a goalless draw at home to Newcastle United, which left Arsenal fourth, three points behind league leaders Leeds United.|$|E
2500|$|The severe {{storms that}} lingered {{throughout}} the week hampered searches for the missing aircraft.

Attempts to hold the ground between the black and green lines failed due to the communication breakdown, the speed of the German advance and worsening visibility as the rain increased during the afternoon. The 55th and 15th division brigades beyond the black line were rolled up from north to south and were overrun or retreated.

2500|$|The British {{forces had}} in the {{meantime}} only encountered small bands of Bulgarian deserters, who informed them that the Second Bulgarian Army under General Georgi Todorov had been reinforced at Strumica. On 26 November 1915, a combination of high wind, rain and snow rendered the already steep terrain impassable. <b>The</b> <b>downpour</b> continued until 3 December, soaking the soldiers to the skin and destroying their greatcoats. A total of 23 officers and 1,663 soldiers had to be evacuated back to Salonika due to frostbite and exhaustion, depleting the 10th Irish Division. The division's efficiency was further lowered {{by the fact that}} a considerable number of its soldiers were recently arrived and unassimilated drafts pulled together from various parts of the British army. On the same day the French forces that were previously in touch with the British at the [...] ravine began their evacuation, dangerously exposing the left flank of the 10th Irish Division. Expecting Greece to remain inert, Bulgaria was now able to launch a fresh offensive with its 120 battalions against the 50 that the Allies {{had in the}}ir disposal. On the morning of 4 December, the Bulgarians built trestle bridges across the Crna river, rapidly occupying Bitola.|$|E
2500|$|Brisbane Tests were {{traditionally}} hit by torrential {{rain and}} in 1974–75 it fell {{heavily in the}} week before the match. The Lord-Mayor of Brisbane, Alderman Clem Jones, sacked the curator at the Gabba so that he could prepare the Test wicket himself. Jones had recently been dethroned as Queensland's representative in the Australian Board of Control, but was still influential in the Queensland Cricket Association. He was a hands-on manager who even manned the turnstiles when he saw the need and had prepared wickets before, but not at Test level. His efforts were not helped by <b>the</b> <b>downpour</b> which turned the ground into sludge, and he admitted that the Test wicket [...] "was a bit crook at one end". However, the scorching Queensland sun and an army of staff working day and night dried out the ground and Jones discarded the muddy wicket for the one used in the Queensland-Western Australia state game. E.W. Swanton thought that over use of the heavy roller on the soft ground had created a ridge at the Vulture Street end, producing uneven bounce, but Frank Tyson noted that only Lillee and Thomson were able to get the ball to rise above stump height and that it only became unpredictable on the last day.|$|E
5000|$|Riccardo Patrese was {{struggling}} with his car because a front wing, from another car, got stuck towards {{the front of his}} undertray.

Mansell then, as a result of <b>the</b> increasing <b>downpour,</b> spun off on the start of lap 16 on the Wakefield Road straight, before turn 3, having [...] "instantly gone out of control" [...] according to Mansell himself. <b>The</b> torrential <b>downpour</b> also made Michele Alboreto spin out of the race on lap 15 as well as Stefano Modena, in his last race for Tyrrell-Honda, although he continued. Nelson Piquet also spun at the high-speed Stag turn but was able to recover and he continued as well.|$|R
