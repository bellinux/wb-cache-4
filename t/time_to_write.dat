5|$|The {{final scene}} {{took a long}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>write.</b> The writing staff found it {{difficult}} {{to come up with a}} resolution that would end on positive terms for Bart and Homer, and was originally different when it was read at the writing table.|$|E
5|$|Despite the hectic {{schedule}} {{during this}} short visit, Wolfgang still found <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> his Symphony in F, K.112 (No.13). He contrived a further symphony from the Ascanio overture, {{by adding a}} finale to the two existing movements. Another symphony, K.96/111b, in C major, is sometimes allocated to this visit to Milan, {{but it is not}} certain when (or indeed whether) Wolfgang actually wrote it.|$|E
5|$|In September 1970, Keating {{was granted}} a {{temporary}} restraining order from the D.C. Federal District Court to delay publication of the report, stating that he needed access to all the report's backing materials and <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a dissent. Several days later, Keating was given the desired materials and two weeks to write his report by the committee.|$|E

5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in August 1973 following the tour supporting the previous album, Foxtrot (1972). The group set aside {{a short period of}} <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> new material, which covered a number of themes, including the loss of English folk culture and an increased American influence, which was reflected in the title. Following the album's release, the group set out on tour, where they drew an enthusiastic reception from fans.|$|E
5|$|Carter and Frank Spotnitz wrote major {{parts of}} the script in Hawaii over Christmas 1996. They used the same method that they had used when writing episodes and {{sketching}} out scenes for the series on 3x5 index cards. By the time the Christmas break had ended, the whole narrative for the film had been written. Upon his return from Hawaii, Carter looked for spare <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the script. He returned to Hawaii and in ten days wrote {{about half of the}} 124-page screenplay for the film.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{construction}} by Col. Parsons in 1861, the ballroom {{in the upper}} story of Wappocomo's stone addition served as the scene of many events and parties. According to tradition, as many as 100 couples have danced on the ballroom's wooden floor since {{its construction}} in 1861. It was the custom of the Parsons family to allow guests who were visiting the mansion for the first <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> their names and the date of their visit on the mortar between the addition's stone blocks; many of these signatures are still legible.|$|E

5|$|François Truffaut as Claude Lacombe, a French {{government}} {{scientist in}} charge of UFO-related activities in the United States. Gérard Depardieu, Philippe Noiret, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Lino Ventura were considered for the role. Internationally renowned as a film director, this was Truffaut's only acting role in a film he did not direct {{as well as his}} only role in an English language film. During filming, Truffaut used his free <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the script for The Man Who Loved Women. He also worked on a novel titled The Actor, a project he abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In June 1933 Massey {{became an}} {{independent}} lecturer in Mathematical Physics at the Queen's University of Belfast. He {{was the only}} member of the department until R. A. Buckingham arrived in 1934. Despite having to give nine lectures a week, he found <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> his second book, Negative Ions (1938), and began working on upper atmospheric physics. Frustrated with the tiresome and time-consuming process of calculation, he had his physics workshop superintendent, John Wylie, build him a small-scale differential analyzer, an analog computer that could solve differential equations, for just £50. This was used to solve problems related to low temperature helium, and the photo-ionisation of oxygen in the upper atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Saman was {{released}} in 1998 after winning the 1997 Jakarta Art Institute novel writing contest. In 1998, Saman won the Jakarta Arts Council Novel Competition. In 2000, it received the Prince Claus Award. By 2005, it had been translated into Dutch and English; the English translation took a long <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> because Utami was concerned that an overexplanation of the novel caused it to lose all of its sensuality. It has also been translated into French, Czech, and Japanese (by two separate translators). , a translation into Korean is underway. By 2004, the book had sold 100,000 copies, a large figure for an Indonesian novel.|$|E

5|$|The film {{features}} a musical score by Aaron Zigman, who wrote 45 minutes of compositions {{in two and}} a half weeks. He had planned to score Akeelah and the Bee over the holidays, but Lionsgate pushed its release date up, so Zigman was pressed for <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the score. He drew inspiration from Fishburne's performance to write it. A soundtrack album consisting of 16 tracks was released by Lionsgate Records in a deal with BMG's RED Distribution on April 4, 2006. It peaked at number 193 on the Billboard 200, and reached the 19th and sixth spot on the Billboard Top Independent Albums and Top Soundtracks respectively. The original score, consisting of 37 tracks, was also released on April 4 as an iTunes exclusive.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{performance}} of an SSD {{is dependent upon}} a number of factors, including write amplification. Writing to a flash memory device takes longer than reading from it. An SSD generally uses multiple flash memory components connected in parallel to increase performance. If the SSD has a high write amplification, the controller {{will be required to}} write that many more times to the flash memory. This requires even more <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> the data from the host. An SSD with a low write amplification will not need to write as much data and can therefore be finished writing sooner than a drive with a high write amplification.|$|E
5|$|After touring Who's Next, and needing <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a follow-up, Townshend {{insisted that}} the Who take a lengthy break, as they had not stopped touring since the band started. There was no group {{activity}} until May 1972, when they started working on a proposed new album, Rock Is Dead—Long Live Rock!, but, unhappy with the recordings, abandoned the sessions. Tensions began to emerge as Townshend believed Daltrey just wanted a money-making band and Daltrey thought Townshend's projects were getting pretentious. Moon's behaviour was becoming increasingly destructive and problematic through excessive drinking and drugs use, {{and a desire to}} party and tour. Daltrey performed an audit of the group's finances and discovered that Lambert and Stamp had not kept sufficient records. He believed them to be no longer effective managers, which Townshend and Moon disputed. The painful dissolution of the managerial and personal relationships are recounted in James D. Cooper's 2014 retrospective documentary, Lambert & Stamp. Following a short European tour, the remainder of 1972 was spent working on an orchestral version of Tommy with Lou Reizner.|$|E

5|$|In {{between these}} works he found <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> Literarum latinarum, a small {{instruction}} manual on the italic script. The italic script (or chancery cursive) reached the Low Countries from Italy {{at the beginning}} of the sixteenth century and it is recorded as a form of typescript in Leuven in 1522. It was much favoured by humanist scholars who enjoyed its elegance and clarity as well as the rapid fluency that could be attained with practice, but it was not employed for formal purposes such as globes, maps and scientific instruments (which typically used Roman capitals or gothic script). Mercator first applied the italic script to the globe of Gemma Frisius and thereafter to all his works, with ever-increasing elegance. The title page of this work is an illustration of the decorative style he developed.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{the game}} was titled Parasite, and {{was meant to be}} {{unrelated}} to the Infinity series, but when development began in May 2003, it was codenamed Project Infinity 3. In September of the same year, they added the subtitle The Age of Infinity. Development was troubled by creative differences between Nakazawa and Uchikoshi; Nakazawa was unhappy with Uchikoshi's idea for the game's ending, and had a different ending in mind, which they were having disagreements over. They also did not have the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> everything that they had wanted, so they ended up with an ending that Uchikoshi described as only being half-finished. At the time of the game's release, a sequel was planned, which would have included a conclusion to the game's story. In 2013, Uchikoshi looked back on the game, saying that while {{he would have liked to}} rewrite some portions of the scenario that he felt were boring or that did not advance the story much, he would not have changed or added anything in terms of the content of the game; he felt that his ending was still in the story, and still felt happy with it.|$|E

25|$|The couple {{moved to}} the Maxwell estate, Glenlair, in around 1865, with James using this <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> up some of his key work.
