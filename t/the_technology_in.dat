5|$|A {{prototype}} for the Kinetoscope {{was shown to}} a convention of the National Federation of Women's Clubs on May 20, 1891. The first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope {{was held at the}} Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. Instrumental to the birth of American movie culture, the Kinetoscope also had a major impact in Europe; its influence abroad was magnified by Edison's decision not to seek international patents on the device, facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on <b>the</b> <b>technology.</b> <b>In</b> 1895, Edison introduced the Kinetophone, which joined the Kinetoscope with a cylinder phonograph. Film projection, which Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope's individual exhibition model. Many of the projection systems developed by Edison's firm in later years would use the Kinetoscope name.|$|E
5|$|Both Germany and the United States have {{developed}} several other rounds. These include the German DM12 multi-purpose anti-tank projectile (MPAT), based on <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> <b>in</b> a high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead. However, {{it has been}} found that the DM12's armor-killing abilities are limited by the lack of blast and fragmentation effects, and that the round is less valuable against lightly armored targets. The United States also has a MPAT type projectile, known as the M830. This was later developed into the M830A1, which allows the M1 Abrams to use the round against helicopters. The M1 Abrams can use the M1028 canister round, which is an anti-personnel/anti-helicopter munition, packed with over 1,000 tungsten balls. The United States Armed Forces accepted a new demolition round, called the M908 Obstacle Defeating Round, based on the M830A1 MPAT, but with the proximity fuse replaced by a hardened nose cap. The cap allows the round to impact and embed itself in concrete, then exploding inside the target and causing more damage.|$|E
5|$|NuScale {{was founded}} based on {{research}} funded by the Department of Energy from 2000 to 2003. After funding was cut, scientists with the program obtained related patents in 2007 and started NuScale to commercialize <b>the</b> <b>technology.</b> <b>In</b> 2011, the company's largest investor had its assets frozen due to {{an investigation by the}} Securities Exchange Commission. The company experienced financial hardship until new funding was obtained from Fluor Corporation and later from the Department of Energy. NuScale is currently planning the first NuScale power plant in Idaho.|$|E

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityThe {{purpose of the study}} was to use geospatial <b>technologies</b> to improve <b>the</b> spatial abilities and specific atmospheric science content knowledge of students in high schools and junior highs in primarily high-needs schools. These technologies include remote sensing, geographic information systems, and global positioning systems. The program involved training the teachers in the use of <b>the</b> <b>technologies</b> at a five-day institute. Scientists who use <b>the</b> <b>technologies</b> <b>in</b> their research taught the basics of their use and scientific background. Standards-based activities were used to integrate <b>the</b> <b>technologies</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classroom setting. Students were tested before any instruction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>technologies</b> and then tested two other times. They used <b>the</b> <b>technologies</b> <b>in</b> field data collection and used that data in an inquiry-based project. Their projects were presented at a mini-science conference with scientists, teachers, parents, and other students in attendance. Significant differences were noted from pre-test to second post-test in the test in both the spatial abilities and science section. There was a gain in both spatial abilities and in specific atmospheric science content knowledge...|$|R

25|$|According to Georgescu's terminology, a {{technology}} is 'viable' {{only when it}} is able to return an energy surplus sufficiently large to maintain its own operation, plus some additional energy left over for other use.

Both viable and feasible technologies depend on a steady flow of natural resources for their operation.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{technology}} being available, it wasn't until the 1950s, when curved shapes such as conoids and hyperbolic parabolas became fashionable, that glue laminated arches were {{more commonly used}} in Australia, particularly for church structures. Recognising the structural and aesthetic potential of this new technology, Oribin specified glue laminated timber arches for two of his earliest buildings, the Mareeba Shire Hall and Proserpine's St Paul's Church; both were designed in 1956 and completed within 5 years, making them an early use of <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> <b>in</b> Queensland. St Paul's was completed first, with engineering details for both buildings provided by Cairns engineer R McLean.|$|E

25|$|ARPA {{was asked}} to {{consider}} the problem of using <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> <b>in</b> a cost-effective way, and noticed one possible application. As Soviet warheads were accurate to within only a few kilometers, {{and they had to}} fall within less than a kilometer to kill a missile silo, that meant the Soviets would have to launch several warheads at every US silo in a counterforce attack. The defender had a significant advantage here; they could watch the incoming warheads, see if any were going to come within the lethal range of a silo, and then shoot just those ones. This meant a small number of ABMs would be effective against a huge number of Soviet warheads.|$|E
