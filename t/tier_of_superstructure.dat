5|$|The stellate plan found {{popularity}} in the soapstone constructions such as the Doddabasappa Temple at Dambal as well. Contemporary stellate plans in northern India were all 32-pointed interrupted types. No temples of the 6-, 12-, or 24-pointed stellate plans are known to exist anywhere in India, {{with the exception of}} the unique temple at Dambal, which can be described either as a 24-pointed uninterrupted plan, or a 48-pointed plan with large square points of 90 degrees alternating with small short points of 75 degrees. The upper <b>tiers</b> <b>of</b> the seven-tiered <b>superstructure</b> look like cogged wheels with 48 dents. The Doddabasappa Temple and the Someshvara Temple at Lakshmeshwara are examples of extreme variants of a basic dravida articulation. These temples prove that the architects and craftsman were consciously creating new compositions of architectural components out of traditional methods.|$|R
50|$|There is good {{information}} concerning {{the location of the}} quarries, some of the tools used to cut stone in the quarries, transportation of the stone to the monument, leveling the foundation, and leveling the subsequent <b>tiers</b> <b>of</b> the developing <b>superstructure.</b> Workmen probably used copper chisels, drills, and saws to cut softer stone, such as most of the limestone. The harder stones, such as granite, granodiorite, syenite, and basalt, cannot be cut with copper tools alone; instead they were worked with time-consuming methods like pounding with dolerite, drilling, and sawing with the aid of an abrasive, such as quartz sand. Blocks were transported by sledge likely lubricated by water. Leveling the foundation may have been accomplished by use of water-filled trenches as suggested by Mark Lehner and I.E.S. Edwards or {{through the use of a}} crude square level and experienced surveyors.|$|R
5000|$|The {{outer wall}} of the temple has {{projections}} and recesses creating niches. In these niches are miniature decorative towers in relief (called aedicula or turrets), the execution of which evolved during the Later Chalukya rule. The vesara style aedicula are supported by double pilasters while the dravida (south Indian) style aedicula are supported by single pilasters. The art historian Percy Brown calls the Later Chalukyan style of wall decoration [...] "exceptionally well rendered", and according to Kamath, the miniature towers are wrought in a [...] "most artistic refrain". Each <b>tier</b> <b>of</b> the <b>superstructure</b> has a kirtimukha (gargoyle like face). Below each kirtimukha, is a relief of a deity such as the Nataraja or Maheshvara (both forms of the Hindu god Shiva). Worthy of mention is the ornate relief on the lintel and door jamb {{at the entrance to}} each sanctum (garbhagriha) which exhibit Saiva dvarapalas ("guardians" [...] to a shrine of the god Shiva) flanked by female umbrella (chauri) bearers. Facing the west sanctum is a small sculpture of Nandi the bull. There are sculptures of various deities from the Hindu pantheon in the niches in the interior {{wall of the}} temple, such as Ganesh (elephant headed god of [...] "beginnings" [...] in Hinduism), Mahishasuramardhini (a form of Durga) and the Saptamatrika (the seven Hindu goddesses). The ceiling in the common hall is supported by four polished lathe turned pillars, which according to Kamath is also a characteristic feature of Western Chalukya temples.|$|R
5000|$|The star {{projections}} {{are carried}} {{right up the}} superstructure (tower over the shrine [...] - [...] Shikhara), giving it an exotic look, though it loses strength {{in comparison to the}} square superstructures found in conventional dravida plans. The storied arrangement <b>of</b> the <b>superstructure</b> found in dravida plans is not easily distinguishable here. The upper <b>tiers</b> <b>of</b> the seven-tiered (tala) superstructure look like cogged wheels with 48 dents.|$|R

40|$|Introduction Otosclerosis is {{a disease}} that causes bone {{resorption}} and deposition in the auditory structures, leading to deafness. Many studies have evaluated the histopathology of the stapes footplate in this disease (osteoblasts, osteoclasts, vascular proliferation, fibroblasts, and histiocytes), but we found no studies in the literature involving the histology <b>of</b> the <b>superstructure</b> <b>of</b> the stapes. Objectives To perform an analysis under optical microscopy of histopathologic findings <b>of</b> the <b>superstructure</b> <b>of</b> the stapes from patients with otosclerosis. Methods A contemporary cross-sectional cohort study of pathology analysis <b>of</b> <b>superstructures</b> <b>of</b> the stapes of patients with otosclerosis. Results Fifteen <b>superstructures</b> <b>of</b> stapes in patients with otosclerosis operated in our service and four stapes of cadavers used for dissection (controls) were evaluated. No areas of bone resorption or deposition or presence of osteoclasts and osteoblasts in the <b>superstructure</b> <b>of</b> the stapes were found. However, we found in themore distal portions of the crura areas with prominent cementitious lines and woven bone, which was different than the mature trabecular bone found in {{the head of the}} stapes or in the controls. Conclusion There were histologic changes in the <b>superstructure</b> <b>of</b> the stapes in patients with otosclerosis operated in our service...|$|R
