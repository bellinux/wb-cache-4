40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} 11 <b>tombolos,</b> which have hosted urban {{settlements}} throughout the long historical process, on Black Sea, Marmara, Aegean and the Mediterranean coastlines in Turkey. Unfortunately, {{most of these}} <b>tombolos</b> that draw attention with their unique appearance within the coastal geomorphology, have not been studied to date. Therefore, this paper aims to make contributions to coastal geomorphology of Turkey. This paper provides brief information, not exceeding several paragraphs, about the formation and functional characteristics of <b>tombolos.</b> The fact that this study is a first in Turkey and {{that the number of}} <b>tombolos</b> is relatively high prevented from going into details. 2 of the <b>tombolos</b> dealt with in this paper are located on the Black Sea coastline, 2 on the Marmara coastline, 5 on the Aegean coastline and 2 on the Mediterranean coastline.

5|$|Bunglan {{was once}} a {{separate}} island, but is now connected to Samphrey by two <b>tombolos.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Tombolos</b> {{demonstrate}} {{the sensitivity of}} shorelines. A small piece of land, such as an island, can change the way that waves move, leading to different deposition of sediments.|$|R
5|$|The {{light is}} {{operated}} by Roads and Maritime Services, while {{the site is}} managed by the National Parks and Wildlife Service {{as part of the}} Tomaree National Park, in which it is located. Visiting the lighthouse is difficult. The point is connected to the mainland with a narrow <b>tombolo,</b> and is only accessible by foot at low tide. It is accessible by boat, and the grounds are open, though the tower is closed to the public.|$|E
5|$|The {{uninhabited}} islands include Mousa, {{known for}} the Broch of Mousa, the finest preserved example in Scotland of an Iron Age broch; Noss {{to the east of}} Bressay, which has been a national nature reserve since 1955; St Ninian's Isle, connected to Mainland by the largest active <b>tombolo</b> in the UK; and Out Stack, the northernmost point of the British Isles. Shetland's location means that it provides a number of such records: Muness is the most northerly castle in the United Kingdom and Skaw the most northerly settlement.|$|E
25|$|The {{sand dune}} system {{which is also}} {{referred}} to as the Kurnell sand dune is estimated to be about 15,000 years old. It was formed when the sea reached its present level and began to stabilise, between 9000 and 6000 BCE. The Georges, Cooks and Towra Rivers flowed to the south-east beneath the present sand dune system near Wanda and joined the ocean at Bate Bay. This resulted in the isolation of Kurnell which was an island from the mainland. The rivers eventually became blocked with accumulating sand and sediment as the sea level rose. As the rivers gradually silted up they were forced into changing their course and were led out to sea via La Perouse rather than continue to maintain an opening in an ever-growing sand barrier near Wanda. This resulted in a <b>tombolo</b> being formed and joined Kurnell with the Cronulla mainland. The deepest part of the ancient river channel now lies 100 meters below the surface {{at the southern end of}} the peninsula, near Wanda Beach.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these large indentations, {{there are a number}} of <b>tombolos</b> connecting peninsulas to the island. Many of these are very fragile, and can be damaged extremely easily by human erosion, or severe storms, creating new islands - or resurrecting old ones.|$|R
50|$|It is {{separated}} from the Tyrrhenian Sea by two <b>tombolos</b> (Giannella {{in the north and}} Feniglia in the south) that join the promontory of Monte Argentario to continental territory. In the middle of the lagoon, on another land strip, is located the town of Orbetello.|$|R
50|$|To {{the north}} west of Samphrey is Bunglan, {{which was once}} an island in its own right, but has become silted up by two <b>tombolos,</b> which now connect it to Samphrey. There is a small loch between Bunglan and Samphrey proper, which can just about {{be seen on the}} aerial picture.|$|R
500|$|The Isle of Portland {{is in the}} English Channel, [...] {{south of}} Wyke Regis, and [...] west-southwest of London, at [...] (50.55,−2.44).

The South West Coast Path runs around the coast; it is the United Kingdom's longest national trail at [...] Portland is unusual as it {{is connected to the}} mainland at Abbotsbury by Chesil Beach, a <b>tombolo</b> which runs [...] north-west to West Bay. Portland is sometimes defined incorrectly as a tombolo—in fact Portland is a tied island, and Chesil Beach is the <b>tombolo</b> (a spit joined to land at both ends).|$|E
500|$|This coast shows {{excellent}} {{examples of}} landforms, including the natural arch at Durdle Door, the cove and limestone folding at Lulworth Cove and a tied island, the Isle of Portland. Chesil Beach {{is a fine}} example of both a <b>tombolo</b> (a deposition landform in which an island is attached to the mainland by a narrow piece of land such as a spit or bar) and a storm beach (a beach affected by particularly fierce waves). The site has stretches of both concordant and discordant coastlines. Due {{to the quality of the}} varied geology, the site is the subject of international field studies.|$|E

It contains a diversity of rock types- gneiss, schist, granite-with a very large glacial erratic on the southern side." [...] The island's east and west sides are connected by a <b>tombolo,</b> and the southern side has a lagoon that winds its way around the lighthouse. It is near many harbors such as Port Chester Harbor ...|$|E
25|$|Shoreline lakes are {{generally}} lakes created by blockage of estuaries {{or by the}} uneven accretion of beach ridges by longshore and other currents. They include maritime coastal lakes, ordinarily in drowned estuaries; lakes enclosed by two <b>tombolos</b> or spits connecting an island to the mainland; lakes cut off from larger lakes by a bar; or lakes divided by the meeting of two spits.|$|R
50|$|Previously {{used for}} logging, farming, and mining {{during the early}} 20th century, the islands are {{returning}} to a primitive state; evidence of human habitation is still present, albeit mostly obscured by the regenerating forests. The islands' coastlines possess varied geology, where precambrian sandstone has eroded into sea caves, and the resulting sand has formed sandspits, cuspate forelands, <b>tombolos,</b> barrier spits, and beaches.|$|R

The path circumnavigates the Isle of Portland, passing the lighthouses at Portland Bill and the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy in Chiswell, and returns across Chesil beach to Wyke Regis (encompassing the Rodwell Trail) and along the shores of Portland Harbour to the Nothe Fort in the resort of Weymouth.|$|E
500|$|Great Captain Island, {{also known}} more familiarly as [...] "Great Captain's Island," [...] {{is an island}} off the coast of Greenwich, Connecticut. The [...] island is the largest of a three-island group that also {{includes}} Little Captain and Wee Captain. The island is a remnant of a glacial moraine and has a large glacial erratic on the southern side, the island's east and west sides are connected by a <b>tombolo.</b> The island has had several owners, but has been owned in whole by the Town of Greenwich since 1973. The island is home to the Great Captain Island Light, a 19th-century lighthouse that was restored in 2009 and relit as a non-navigational aid in 2012. The actual navigation aid is a skeletal tower erected in 1970. Great Captain Island is one of the state's 26 [...] "important bird areas" [...] according to the Connecticut Audubon Society. The town operates a ferry service to and from the island from about the second week in June through the second week of September. Trails have been laid out for visitors, and {{the western part of the}} island has picnic tables, grills, restrooms, and posted swimming areas. The island is open year round, with a ferry running during the summer. No public tours of the lighthouse or island are available.|$|E

The beach and the Fleet are part of the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the location for a 2007 novel, On Chesil Beach by Ian McEwan.|$|E
40|$|Análisis de la atenuación del oleaje por un carguero funcionando como dique flotante y aplicación a dos casos de protección portuaria y costera. The {{effectiveness}} of a bulk carrier working as a detached floating breakwater to protect a stretch of coast and form salients or <b>tombolos</b> is assessed in this paper. Experiments were conducted in the Madrid CEDEX facilities in a 30 m long, 3 m wide, 1 / 150 scale flume. The bulk carrier ship is 205 m long, 29 m wide and 18 m in height with a draught of 13 m, and {{has been subjected to}} irregular waves with significant heights from 2 m to 4 m and peak periods from 6 s to 12 s at a depth of 15 m, all prototype dimensions. Three probes were placed between the wave paddle and the ship to record incident and reflected waves and four probes were placed between the ship and the coastline to measure the transmitted waves. Transmission, reflection and dissipation coefficients (Ct, Cr, Cd) were calculated to determine wave attenuation. Results show good shelter in the lee of the ship with values of Ct under 0. 5 for peak periods from 6 s to 11 s. In addition, forces on the mooring chains were measured showing maximum values of about 2000 tons at a 10 speak period. Finally, two analytical models were used to determine the shoreline’s response to the ship’s protection and to assess the possible forming of salients or <b>tombolos.</b> According to the results, salients - but not <b>tombolos</b> - are formed in all tests...|$|R
50|$|Sandy shores, {{also called}} beaches, are coastal shorelines where sand accumulates. Waves and {{currents}} shift the sand, continually building and eroding the shoreline. Longshore currents flow {{parallel to the}} beaches, making waves break obliquely on the sand. These currents transport large amounts of sand along coasts, forming spits, barrier islands and <b>tombolos.</b> Longshore currents also commonly create offshore bars, which give beaches some stability by reducing erosion.|$|R
50|$|The {{other main}} road to Rome, the Via Aurelia, became unsafe in medieval {{times with the}} spread of malaria, because it passed through the {{unhealthy}} marshes near several coastal lakes in the Maremma lowlands (as Orbetello lagoon, Capalbio lake, and other <b>Tombolos),</b> and because its route by the sea made it more susceptible to attack from raiders. The coastal towns around Via Aurelia were areas subjected to kidnapping of women and plunder by Muslim Saracen pirates.|$|R
