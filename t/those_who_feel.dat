25|$|George Lakoff, a {{professor}} of cognitive linguistics and philosophy, advances the view that metaphors are the usual basis of meaning, not the logic of verbal symbol manipulation. Computers use logic programming to effectively query databases but humans rely on a trained biological neural network. Post modern philosophies that use the indeterminacy of symbolic language to deny definite meaning ignore <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> {{they know what they}} mean and feel that their interlocutors know what they mean. Choosing the correct metaphor results in enough common understanding to pursue questions such as the meaning of life. Improved knowledge of brain function should result in better treatments producing healthier brains. When combined with more effective training, a sound personal assessment as to the meaning of one’s life should be straightforward.|$|E

The main characters disappear, leaving behind the government and army, who are left to bully each other.

500|$|The tragedy Sardanapalus by George Gordon Byron {{published}} in 1821 and produced in 1834 {{is set in}} Assyria, 640 B.C., under King Sardanapalus. The play deals with the revolt against the extravagant king and his relationship to his favourite slave Myrrha. Myrrha made Sardanapalus appear {{at the head of}} his armies, but after winning three successive battles in this way he was eventually defeated. A beaten man, Myrrha persuaded Sardanapalus to place himself on a funeral pyre which she would ignite and subsequently leap onto - burning them both alive. The play has been interpreted as an autobiography, with Sardanapalus as Byron's alter ego, Zarina as Byron's wife Anne Isabella, and Myrrha as his mistress Teresa. At a more abstract level Myrrha is the desire for freedom driving <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> trapped or bound, as well as being the incarnation of Byron's dream of romantic love. Byron knew the story of the mythical Myrrha, if not directly through Ovid's Metamorphoses, then at least through Alfieri's Mirra, which he was familiar with. In her essay [...] "A Problem Few Dare Imitate", Susan J. Wolfson phrases and interprets the relation of the play Sardanapalus and the myth of Myrrha: ...|$|E

500|$|Having {{spent almost}} two years working on the novel, Cleave decided upon using the dual narrative, as: [...] "This {{is a story of}} two worlds: the {{developed}} and the developing, and of the mutual incomprehension that sometimes dooms them to antagonism." [...] He found it technically challenging to write from a female perspective, but felt that it prevented him from unwittingly using his own voice to animate the characters, explaining: [...] "It forces me to listen, to think, and to write more precisely." [...] Kaminski accused Cleave of cultural appropriation, asking rhetorically: [...] "When a white male author writes as a young Nigerian girl, is it an act of empathy, or identity theft?" [...] Cleave has responded by stating that he sympathises with <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> he has no right to write {{from the perspective of a}} Nigerian girl, but feels that he does it well. He believes that the best mechanism for telling a story about crossing borderlines is to depict both sides.

500|$|Christensen {{points out}} that [...] "although there is no {{evidence}} that Lord Byron, padrone and amico, was ever so vulgar as to set an exact market value on his sexual arrangements in Greece, Nicolo Giraud, Eustathius's replacement in Byron's affections, was employed as 'dragoman and Major Domo', a position that almost certainly entailed payment in love and money". D. L. MacDonald's 1986 biography simply describes Giraud as [...] "The great love of Byron's Eastern tour", and D. S. Neff's 2002 work describes the two as part of [...] "an amorous relationship". Others, such Jay Losey and William Brewer in their analysis of 19th-century sexuality, speculate that Byron's relationship with Giraud was modeled on a Grecian form of pederasty, and homosexual studies scholar Louis Crompton believes that pederasty was a facet of Byron's life and that his letters hinted towards a sexual relationship between Byron and Giraud. As Paul Douglass, in an analysis of Byron biographical studies, points out, Crompton also claims that biographers like Marchand ignored the nature of Byron's relationship with Giraud. Douglass also mentions that Crompton's work, Byron and Greek Love [...] "focuses Byron's life around a single issue, rather than attempting to create a larger view. Such studies prompt negative responses from <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> the writer warps Byron to fit the theme, presenting a one-sided account".|$|E
500|$|Xenogears was Yasunori Mitsuda's {{first major}} solo work, as his {{previous}} soundtracks were collaborations with other composers {{with the exception}} of the score to , which never saw an album release. According to Mitsuda, the music of Xenogears belongs to the traditional music genre. Though he first described it as stemming from [...] "a world of [...] own imagining" [...] rather than any specific country, he has also claimed a strong Irish or Celtic music influence. His musical approach for the original soundtrack was to insert Celtic influences into [...] "easy-to-listen-to" [...] pop tracks rather than making either [...] "dense" [...] Celtic music or simple background music. For Creid, he expanded on this theme to create an album of arranged Xenogears music with a more prominent Celtic style. The album contains a mixture of vocal and instrumental tracks, and combines Japanese and Celtic music together in its pieces. The album's title refers to two ideas, with one being [...] "a message to <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>feel</b> they have lost sight of their ambitions for the flood of information this era surrounds us with" [...] and the other an affirmation to himself that Mitsuda had [...] "rediscovered [...] own path". Mitsuda felt that with this album, he had [...] "discovered the precise mode of musical expression [...] was seeking within" [...] himself and [...] "given form to the belief within [...] heart".|$|E
