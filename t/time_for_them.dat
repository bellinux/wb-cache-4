5|$|Adam Williams (James Nesbitt) {{breaks up}} with another {{in a long line}} of girlfriends and spends the evening at the pub with his friend Pete Gifford (John Thomson). Pete arrives home late, which annoys his wife Jenny (Fay Ripley), who {{calculated}} that night to be the best <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to conceive a child. She becomes even more frustrated when she sees Pete has brought Adam back; he missed his last bus home. Rachel Bradley's (Helen Baxendale) boyfriend Simon Atkinson (Stephen Mapes) breaks up with her over dinner after taking a job in Hong Kong. Rachel angrily leaves the restaurant and telephones her friend Karen Marsden (Hermione Norris), who has just asked her husband David (Robert Bathurst) if they can get a nanny to take care of their son Josh.|$|E
5|$|Loading at Australian ports was {{frequently}} disorganised and sloppy. Manifests were not flown ahead, so New Guinea Force {{did not know}} the contents of a shipment beforehand. Some ships arrived without manifests. The labelling of contents was also poor, and boxes often had to be broken into to determine their contents. Even then it was not always apparent who the intended recipient was. Much of the problem was poor staff work by the inexperienced Movement Control staff at Advanced Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) in Brisbane. The Australian Army had never had to handle such work before. Men with experience in the shipping industry were appointed as Movement Control officers, but it took <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to learn about military cargoes and procedures.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor {{finds his}} changes to Kazran's past have locked him {{out from the}} spire's controls, but the Doctor devises a solution: by having Abigail sing through {{one half of the}} broken sonic screwdriver, the other half, still in the shark, will {{resonate}} in the atmosphere and disrupt the storm to allow the ship to land safely. Kazran releases Abigail knowing this will be the last time, but Abigail understands and believes it is <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to share a Christmas Day. The plan works successfully, and the resulting cloud break-out creates snowfall that falls around the city. As the Doctor rejoins Amy and Rory and prepares to take young Kazran back to the past, old Kazran and Abigail enjoy one last shark-led carriage-ride together.|$|E

5|$|The {{first known}} serious study on attacking {{ballistic}} missiles with interceptor missiles {{was carried out}} by the Army Air Force in 1946, when two contracts were sent out as Project Wizard and Project Thumper to consider the problem of shooting down missiles of the V-2 type. These projects identified the main problem being one of detection; the target could approach from anywhere within of hundreds of miles, and reached their targets in only five minutes. Existing radar systems would have difficulty seeing the missile launch at those ranges, and even assuming one had detected the missile, existing command and control arrangements would have serious problems forwarding that information to the battery in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to attack. The task appeared impossible at that time.|$|E
5|$|Following Cortés' visit, no Spanish {{attempted}} {{to visit the}} warlike Itza inhabitants of Nojpetén for almost a hundred years. In 1618 two Franciscan friars set out from Mérida in Yucatán {{on a mission to}} attempt the peaceful conversion of the still pagan Itza in central Petén. Bartolomé de Fuensalida and Juan de Orbita were accompanied by some Christianised Maya. Andrés Carrillo de Pernía, a Criollo who was the alcalde of Bacalar (a colonial official), joined the party at Bacalar and escorted them upriver as far as Tipuj, returning to Bacalar once he was certain of the friars receiving a good welcome there. After an arduous six-month journey the travellers were well received by the current Kan Ek'. They stayed at Nojpetén for some days in an attempt to evangelise the Itza, but the Aj Kan Ek' refused to renounce his Maya religion, although he showed interest in the masses held by the Catholic missionaries. Kan Ek' informed them that according to ancient Itza prophecy it was not yet <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to convert. In the time since Cortés had visited Nojpetén, the Itza had made a statue of the deified horse. Juan de Orbita was outraged when he saw the idol and he immediately smashed it into pieces. Fuensalida was able to save the lives of the visitors from the infuriated natives by means of a particularly eloquent sermon that resulted in them being forgiven. Attempts to convert the Itza failed, and the friars left Nojpetén on friendly terms with Kan Ek'.|$|E
25|$|A variant {{method of}} fish stocking, called ocean ranching, is under {{development}} in Alaska. There, the young salmon are {{released into the}} ocean far from any wild salmon streams. When it is <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to spawn, they return {{to where they were}} released, where fishermen can catch them.|$|E

25|$|The airport {{with regular}} {{commercial}} service {{closest to the}} event is the Reno-Tahoe International Airport in Reno, Nevada, over two hours' drive away. An airport spokesperson said in 2009 that 15,000 burners arrive to the event via the airport annually, making it the second-busiest <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> In 2008 and 2009, an information desk for burners was organized in Reno airport.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} {{speed is}} increased, with an entire brigade on standby readiness; the military retains {{the capability to}} continually deploy 2,000 soldiers in international service or 5,000 over a short time span. The standard mandatory conscription is modified. Generally this means fewer conscripts, less service <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> and only those who choose so, will continue into the reaction force system.|$|E
25|$|Ball lock: Each time a ball {{goes into}} a {{specific}} hole or target, it is locked, and a new ball appears at the plunger. When the player has locked the required number of balls (often three), the multiball feature starts. On some games, the balls are physically locked in place by solenoid-actuated gates, but many newer machines use virtual ball locks instead, in which the game merely keeps count {{of the number of}} locked balls and then auto-launches them from the main ball trough when it is <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to be released.|$|E

25|$|Immediately a {{consortium}} of Tigers fans was formed to save the club. Headed by local businessman Mike Davies, they put together a viable package {{to take over the}} administration and running of the team. However, Nike failed to reach agreement in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to lease the franchise, and the deadline for entry into the British Basketball League for the 2005–06 season was reached. The Tigers' BBL membership thus lapsed, but the fans obtained permission from the League to enter a new team in its place, and successful negotiations with The Spectrum in Guildford led to the birth of the Guildford Heat franchise.|$|E
25|$|Episode three: Jim and Diane - Jim and Diane {{have been}} {{together}} for twenty-three years, and according to them, there has not been much <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> both looking and feeling good together. Diane was previously a size six stripper and it was that image which first attracted Jim. Diane, now a size sixteen, is a self-conscious woman who hides her figure in tracksuits. After talking and observing, Woodall and Constantine quickly find that the spark that has been lost inside this relationship can be recovered. Diane and Jim are both given a totally new and fresh look and are reunited. Diane and Jim are also treated to some pampering from hair dresser, Richard Ward.|$|E
25|$|African penguin females remain fertile for 10 years. African {{penguins}} {{spend most}} of their lives at sea until it comes <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to lay their eggs. Due to the high predation by larger mammals on the mainland, the penguins will go offshore to an island for protection from mammals and natural challenges. African penguins usually breed during the African winter when temperatures are lower. Ideally, eggs are incubated in a burrow dug into the guano layer, which provides a suitable temperature regulation, but the widespread human removal of guano deposits has rendered this type of nest unfeasible at most colonies. To compensate, penguins dig holes in the sand, breed in the open, or make use of nest boxes if such are provided. The penguins spend three weeks on land to provide for their offspring, after which chicks may be left alone during the day while the parents forage. The eggs are three to four times bigger than hen’s eggs. Parents usually feed hatchlings during dusk or dawn.|$|E

25|$|The Vikings {{boosted by}} return of Captain Ian Cahill {{for the final}} felt it was <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to win their first {{silverware}} since 2010. However, the Trinity team who had scouted the previous game and had fresh legs started quick and were 2 scores up within the first quarter. The Vikings rattled responded positively with some outstanding Defensive play from the entire squad Ian Cahill, Donogh Flannery, Pat Noonan, Brian Kelly, Rob Crimin, Lorcan Crean, Ray Burke, Craig Switzer, Kevin Flaherty, Bono and Alvaro. However, despite several turnovers the Vikings offence struggled and the 2 games started to take their tole on an impressive offensive line. The Vikings played out the game and ultimately the scores remained 14–0. The Vikings battled valiantly with their most impressive rookie class in memory which surely {{bode well for the}} coming season. Impressive displays by the entire team and toughness shown by the offence through their struggles showed positive signs for the Vikings going forward. The Vikings then regrouped and disbanded before pre-season training began again in mid-January. With some hard work on offence and continued effort on Defence the Vikings team looks like it's ready for big things n 2014.|$|E
500|$|In {{the town}} of Gibsonton, Florida one night, two {{brothers}} are playing in their home outdoor swimming pool. A mysterious figure approaches them from the woods surrounding their home and jumps into the pool without them noticing. As the brothers play, they notice something is wrong and before they leave the pool, the figure emerges from the water. It's revealed to be the boys' father, [...] "Alligator Man", who scares his sons for fun. [...] After some laughs in the pool, the [...] "Alligator Man" [...] tells his children {{to go back into}} the house as it is late and <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to go to bed. The boys leave the pool and their father stays behind to swim. An unknown mysterious figure approaches the pool from the woods. It attacks and kills [...] "Alligator Man" [...] in his pool.|$|E
500|$|The period {{following}} Enema of the State saw {{the band}} experience great transition. [...] "We {{had gone from}} playing small clubs and sleeping on people's floors to headlining amphitheaters and staying in five-star hotels," [...] recalled Hoppus in 2013. [...] "After years of hard work, promotion, and nonstop touring, people knew who we were, and listened to what we were saying... it scared {{the shit out of}} us." [...] The band was rushed into recording the follow-up, as according to DeLonge, [...] "the president of MCA was penalizing us an obscene amount of money because our record wasn't going to be out in <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to make their quarterly revenue statements. [...] And we were saying, 'Hey, we can't do this right now, we need to reorganize ourselves and really think about {{what we want to do}} and write the best record we can.' They didn't agree with us." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 24 January 1997 - Roy Sproson, 66, {{who died}} of cancer, spent his whole career as a centre-half with Port Vale and played 837 <b>times</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> After {{retiring}} as a player in 1972 he later served the club as coach and manager.|$|R

500|$|A {{friend of}} the band, Monte A. Melnick (later their tour manager), helped to arrange {{rehearsal}} <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> at Manhattan's Performance Studios, where he worked. Johnny's former bandmate Erdelyi was set to become their manager. Soon after the band was formed, Dee Dee realized {{that he could not}} sing and play his bass guitar simultaneously; with Erdelyi's encouragement, Joey became the band's new lead singer. Dee Dee would continue, however, to count off each song's tempo with his signature rapid-fire shout of [...] "1-2-3-4!" [...] Joey soon similarly realized that he could not sing and play drums simultaneously and left the position of drummer. While auditioning prospective replacements, Erdelyi would often take to the drums and demonstrate how to play the songs. It became apparent {{that he was able to}} perform the group's music better than anyone else, and he joined the band as Tommy Ramone.|$|E
500|$|Bevel, {{a veteran}} of earlier nonviolent student protests with the Nashville Student Movement and SNCC, had been named SCLC's Director of Direct Action and Nonviolent Education. After {{initiating}} the idea he organized and educated the students in nonviolence tactics and philosophy. King hesitated to approve the use of children, but Bevel believed that children were appropriate for the demonstrations because jail <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> would not hurt families economically {{as much as the}} loss of a working parent. He also saw that adults in the black community were divided about how much support to give the protests. [...] Bevel and the organizers knew that high school students were a more cohesive group; they had been together as classmates since kindergarten. He recruited girls who were school leaders and boys who were athletes. Bevel found girls more receptive to his ideas because they had less experience as victims of white violence. When the girls joined, however, the boys were close behind.|$|E
500|$|Lamont {{has said}} that Labour lost the 2011 Scottish Parliament {{election}} because the party lost its direction, and that having failed to recognise the 2007 result as a defeat, it picked up the wrong signals from the 2010 general election that saw a strong Scottish Labour vote at Westminster. In February 2012 she told the Times Educational Supplement, [...] "We misread the 2010 (general) election, thinking it was confirmation that Scotland was a Labour country– it was probably confirmation that Scotland was still anti-Tory. There's an issue about rebuilding trust, and our confidence in the values that brought us into politics." [...] She told delegates at her party's 2012 Scottish conference that it was <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> to stop apologising for past mistakes. [...] "We know what happened last May – we looked tired and complacent and we got the kind of beating we deserved. But now, {{we need to start}} building the kind of Scottish Labour Party which Scotland deserves and which Scotland needs." ...|$|E
