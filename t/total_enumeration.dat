40|$|ABSTRACT: Airborne {{indoor and}} outdoor {{bacteria}} and fungi were assessed during the spring season using conven-tional methods to investigate the enumeration and identification of airborne micro-organisms. This was determined through air quality sampling using the ‘open plate technique’. The air samples were collected during the spring season (March-May) from four different locations. Conventional enumeration of airborne micro-organisms relies on culture-based or microscopic methods. Although a culture-based analysis is most widely used for bio-aerosol, four public places located in urban residential areas were selected for indoor/outdoor air bio-pollutant measurement. The public places included kitchens, classrooms, recreational areas, laboratories. Public parks are an important facility associated with the environmental exposure of children. Cultivation and <b>total</b> microscopic <b>enumeration</b> methods were employed for the sample analysis. 26 groups of bacteria and fungi, either of human or environmental origin were detected.

The composition of the bacterial community of the biofilm followed a continuous seasonal succession that may be explained by the influence of both biotic factors such as seasonal changes in the kelp substrate and abiotic factors such as seawater temperature. Planctomycetes and Alphaproteobacteria were frequently detected throughout the year, while Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were more sporadically detected.

40|$|AbstractA {{comparative}} study {{was carried out}} to evaluate the effects of two water irrigation sources on the quality and microbiological safety of tomato plants and fruit, and on the microbiological soil properties: irrigation with groundwater (GW) and with treated agro-industrial wastewater (TW). In a field experiment in southern Italy (Apulia region), the physico-chemical characteristics of the irrigation waters and the fruit quality parameters were determined. Escherichia coli, fecal Enterococci and Salmonella spp. were also monitored in the irrigation waters, tomato plant and fruit, and root-zone soil. Bacteriological analysis for total heterotrophic counts (THCs) were determined for plant, fruit, and soil samples. The irrigation water source did not significantly affect yield quantitative traits. However, with GW, the marketable fruit yield was higher than with TW (∼ 82 vs. ∼ 79 Mgha− 1, respectively). For both irrigation treatments, the most important qualitative parameters that characterize the processing tomato fruit (i. e., dry matter content, pH, soluble solid content, color parameters) were in agreement with reports in the literature. For the microbiological results, the mean levels of E. coli and fecal Enterococci were 4408 and 3804 CFU 100 ml− 1, respectively, for TW (above the Italian guidelines for TW re-use). For the tomato plant and fruit, no E. coli isolated in either, and fecal coliforms and THC were not influenced by the irrigation waters (P> 0. 05). <b>Total</b> bacterial <b>enumeration</b> by quantitative PCR was lower in soil irrigated with GW, than TW (3. 69 vs. 4. 02, × 106, respectively).

40|$|The {{shelf life}} of a fresh meat product can be {{measured}} by a <b>total</b> bacterial <b>enumeration</b> method, which is time-consuming, expensive, and destructive to conduct. Due to these issues, there is interest in developing a shelf life model from an instrument measurement, which has the capability to be less time-consuming, less expensive, and non-destructive. One instrument measurement {{that could be used}} to estimate shelf life is dissolved carbon dioxide (CO 2). There are few studies published that investigate dissolved CO 2 concentrations in the context of shelf life or its relationship to the microbial population. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine the dissolved CO 2 and O 2 concentrations in the purge of vacuum-packaged pork chops during storage, and to determine the relationship between dissolved CO 2 and O 2 concentrations to the microbial populations and shelf life. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were also taken of the packaging film in contact with the meat product to investigate how the biofilm develops on the packaging film throughout the shelf life. These objectives were completed by taking sixty pork loin chops and placing them into twenty vacuum-packages. In each vacuum-package, a set of purge collection tubes were placed into each bag to collect the purge for the dissolved gas measurements. These packages were stored at 4 °C for 60 days, and the packages were sampled randomly on days 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60. On the sample days, the dissolved gases were measured and microbiological analysis conducted. The results of the experiment demonstrated that the spoilage bacteria increased the dissolved CO 2 and decreased the dissolved O 2 concentrations during the 60 day storage period by cellular respiration. The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) dominated the spoilage microflora, followed by Enterobacteriaceae and Brochothrix thermosphacta. Since the dissolved CO 2 concentrations increased due to the increase in microbial populations, this information was used to develop mathematical models. These mathematical models estimate microbial populations and shelf life based upon dissolved CO 2 concentrations in the purge of vacuum-packaged pork chops. The SEM images revealed a two-layer biofilm on the packaging film that was the result of a tri-phase growth environment...|$|R

Kano State, Anambra State, and Lagos State, which were considered high and medium risk areas for bird flu introduction and transmission based on the risk maps developed in the project. There are seven states classified as high and medium bird flu disease risk in terms of transmission and introduction. The high risk areas are Kano State, Borono State, Sokoto State, Lagos State, while medium risk areas are Anambra, Rivers, and Kastina. All other states in Nigeria are classified as low risk areas in bird flu introduction and transmission (National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) 2014, AICP (2014)). The choice of these three states were informed {{based on the fact that}} population of poultry producers in these states accounted for 67.5 % of poultry producers in Nigeria (2013). In addition, the incidence of bird flu accounted for 80 % of the entire disease incidence in Nigeria (NBS, 2014). Following the UNDP (2007) definitions of poultry production system, Nigeria poultry industry is classified into four production systems (backyard/free-range (BY), and small-scale (SS), and medium-scale (MS), and large-scale (LS). The sampling frame constitutes the entire household in the selected states. In fact, 97 and 75 % of household in rural and urban Nigeria rear/own poultry, respectively (Obi et al. 2009). A complete listing of housing units and households in each selected enumeration area provided the frames of households (HHs) for the second stage selection in selected EAs. The <b>total</b> of 30 <b>enumeration</b> areas were sampled in each state based on poultry population, which was provided by poultry association of Nigeria (PAN) and Avian Influenza Control Project Office (AICP) in each of the selected states. Given the focus of the project was on the poor, the distribution of enumeration areas was skewed to rural areas. Therefore, 23 enumeration areas were selected in rural areas or peri-urban areas and 7 enumeration areas were selected in urban areas. From each of the enumeration areas 8 housing units were selected from each state creating a sample of 240 housing unit. In each of the 240 housing unit, three households were selected.

Our objectives were to assess the effect of feed texture combined with feed particle size on VFA profiles and levels, total E. coli count, and the presence of genes encoding virulence factors of pathogenic E. coli strains in the digestive tract along with their impact on pig performance of fattening pigs. Pigs (n = 840) on a commercial farm received mash or pellet diets of different particle sizes during the fattening period. Caecal and colon contents from 164 pigs were sampled at the slaughterhouse for enumeration of E. coli by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and for VFA quantification by capillary gas chromatography. The yccT gene was used to enumerate total E. coli. Improved pig performances associated with pellet texture and a 500 -μm size were observed. Caecal (P = 0. 02) and colon (P < 0. 01) propionic acid concentrations were lower for pigs receiving pellet rather than mash feed. Similarly, caecal (P = 0. 01) and colon (P < 0. 001) butyric acid concentrations were also lower for pigs receiving pellet rather than mash feed, as determined by capillary gas chromatography. Moreover, caecal (P = 0. 03) and colon (P < 0. 001) butyric acid concentrations were higher for pigs receiving a feed with a 1, 250 -μm particle size rather than a 500 -μm particle size.

No effect of particle size on fatty acid concentrations or on E. coli numbers was observed. Virulence gene quantification revealed no trend. Taken together, results showed that mash feed is associated with lower growth performance but with favorable intestinal changes linked to VFA levels and E. coli reduction in the intestine...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{job satisfaction and}} self-efficacy of library personnel as determinants of their job performance. A descriptive survey research design was adopted for the study. <b>Total</b> <b>enumeration</b> was used to cover 112 library personnel using structured questionnaire. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Four research questions were answered in the study. Result obtained indicated that, the levels of job performance, job satisfaction and self-efficacy of library personnel in universities in Southwest Nigeria were high. Job satisfaction has the highest relative contribution to the job performance of library personnel. Among what the paper recommends is that, that good working condition should {{be put in place}} so as to sustain the high level of job motivation and job satisfaction among the library personnel in universities in particular and other higher institutions of learning in Nigeria...|$|E
40|$|In {{reference}} to the significance of a marginal profession, 44 Missouri chiropractors practicing in 20 rural counties (<b>total</b> <b>enumeration)</b> were compared with 39 randomly selected Kansas City chiropractors to determine the following characteristics: (1) social background; ` (2) place history (at time of birth, start of school; termination of 8 th grade, and termination of high school); (3) progress in entering the field (education); and (4) nature of the practicing chiropractor and his practice. Findings indicated that rural chiropractors were: (1) from white collar families with entrepreneural tendencies; (2) pursuing this field out of a need to fulfill an entrepreneural imperative, rather than a specific career calling; (3) practicing in areas comparable to their place of origin; and (4) trained in or adjacent to their state of origin. It was concluded that the concepts of localism and client control influence...|$|E
40|$|The term subitization {{has been}} used to refer to the fast and {{accurate}} enumeration of up to about 4 items. Beyond 4 items, enumeration becomes more serial and less accurate, with each additional item adding to the <b>total</b> <b>enumeration</b> time. The effects of aging on visual enumeration of targets (Os) were assessed with and without the presence of distractors (Xs). Young participants (n = 30; 18 - 27 years) showed the usual subitization-counting enumeration function, both with and without the presence of distractors. In contrast, for older participants (n = 35; 65 - 79 years), evidence for subitization was found only when distractors were absent. This occurred even though they could detect an individual target among distractors in parallel across the field. The results are discussed in relation to recent theories of visual selection and enumeration. ...|$|E

Diet {{composition}} at weaning {{affects the}} rumen microbial population and methane emissions by lambs. ?Australian Journal of Experimental Agriculture, 48 (2), 186 - 188. On file IMPF: 00. 81 RONO: 00 The {{aim of this}} experiment was to investigate whether different diets at weaning determine the microbial populations established in the rumen, together with its methanogenic capacity, and whether these differences are consistent over a longer time period. Twenty ewes with single lambs were used in two periods. Period I: 10 lambs had access only to grass hay whilst with the dam and for 8 weeks after weaning (group H). The other 10 lambs had free access to concentrate and grass hay whilst with the dam and were fed with a 60 : 40 mix of concentrate and grass hay for 8 weeks after weaning (group C). Eight weeks after weaning, methane emissions were measured in polycarbonate chambers over a 3 -day period. After methane emission measurements, five lambs from each groupwere randomly selected and slaughtered and samples of rumen content collected for measuring rumen fermentation parameters and for microbial <b>enumeration</b> (<b>total</b> and cellulolytic bacteria and methanogenic archeaea) by most probable number. Period II: the remaining 10 lambs were grouped together and fed the same diet (grass and concentrate) for 4 months. After this period, all animals were fed concentrate and grass hay (60 : 40) for 2 weeks and introduced in to the chambers to measure methane emissions over a 3 -day period. After measurements, they were slaughtered and rumen samples collected and analysed as in Period I. Lambs from group H produced more (P= 0. 04) methane than group C lambs (26. 0 v. 22. 5 L/kgDM intake) in Period I. Group H lambs also had less total bacteria (10. 2 ? 1010 v. 61. 6 ? 1010 cells; P= 0. 284) but more cellulolytic bacteria (40. 6 ? 109 v. 10. 0 ? 109 cells; P= 0. 098) and methanogenic archaea (37. 1 ? 109 v. 19. 0 ? 109 cells; P= 0. 113) than group C lambs in Period I. The acetate to propionate ratio tended to be higher (P= 0. 089) in group H lambs than in group C lambs (3. 00 v. 2. 35). In Period II, methane produced was not different (P> 0. 05) between the groups (26. 6. v. 25. 7 L/kgDM intake by group C and H lambs, respectively). Microbial numbers and fermentation parameters were also similar in samples collected from both experimental groups in Period II. Our {{results show that the}} differences observed as a result of providing different diets at weaning disappear in the long-term. It may be appropriate to study a wider range of dietary treatments to better understand the factors determining the microbial populations establishing in the rumen. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Assembly line {{balancing}} {{is a classic}} ill-structured problem where <b>total</b> <b>enumeration</b> is infeasible and optimal solutions uncertain for industrial problems. A quantitative approach to classifying problem difficulty and solution quality is therefore important. Two existing measures of difficulty, Order Strength and West Ratio are compared to a new compound expression of difficulty, Project Index. Project Index is based on individual assessment of precedence (Precedence Index) and task time (Task Time Index). The current working definition of Project Index is given. Early criteria for judging assembly lines use Balance Delay and Smoothness Index, both are flawed as criteria. Line and Balance Efficiency are developed as more appropriate. Project Index, Line and Balance Efficiency will be illustrated for a published test-case examined by the `A~Line' balancing package. The potential for a "learning" approach, selecting models to suit problems using the measures of difficulty, will form par [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Reliable {{methods for}} <b>total</b> <b>enumeration</b> and {{activity}} measurements of environmental airborne microorganisms are generally lacking. In other environmental habitats, like sea water, fresh water and soil, in general less than 1 % of bacterial populations are easily cultivated on agar plates. However, most bacteria may be alive in such environments, their activity {{are assumed to}} be limited i. e. by nutrient availability. We collected samples using a XMX-CV particle collector (Dycor Technologies Ltd) as well as rain. The bacterial concentrations in these liquid samples were measured using Flow cytometry, RT-PCR and agar plates. Samples collected for flow cytometric analysis was fixed by glutaraldehyde, stained by SYBRGreen I (Molecular Probes) and diluted in PBS before analysis (i. e. Marie at al 1999). RT-PCR was performed according to different DNA rinsing protocols including commercially available kits, as well as direct analysis of samples. Agar plates were used to quantify the easily culturable bacterial fraction...|$|E
