40|$|Abstract This {{qualitative}} ethnographic {{study was}} conducted in a family owned and operated bar. This particular research project seeks to examine leisure activities that take place in a small bar that is family owned and operated. The research concentrates on how the family members and bartenders accommodate the leisure of <b>the</b> <b>patrons</b> that visit <b>the</b> bar. The main goal {{of the study was to}} describe the use of leisure by <b>the</b> <b>patrons</b> and how <b>the</b> bartenders and family members contribute to the leisure of <b>the</b> <b>patrons.</b> <b>The</b> regulars of this tavern have either traded other social ties for the social ties at this tavern or they have failed in other social arenas and sought social acceptance at the tavern. Interestingly, many of <b>the</b> tavern <b>patrons</b> come from varied socioeconomic backgrounds...|$|R

5|$|According to legend, in 832 A.D. Óengus II led {{an army of}} Picts and Scots {{into battle}} against the Angles, led by Æthelstan, near modern-day Athelstaneford, East Lothian. The legend states that whilst engaged in prayer {{on the eve of}} battle, Óengus vowed that if granted victory he would appoint Saint Andrew as <b>the</b> <b>Patron</b> Saint of Scotland; Andrew then {{appeared}} to Óengus that night in a dream and assured him of victory. On the morning of battle white clouds forming the shape of an X were said to have appeared in the sky. Óengus and his combined force, emboldened by this apparent divine intervention, took to the field and despite being inferior in terms of numbers were victorious. Having interpreted the cloud phenomenon as representing the crux decussata upon which Saint Andrew was crucified, Óengus honoured his pre-battle pledge and duly appointed Saint Andrew as <b>the</b> <b>Patron</b> Saint of Scotland. The white saltire set against a celestial blue background {{is said to have been}} adopted as the design of the flag of Scotland on the basis of this legend.|$|E
