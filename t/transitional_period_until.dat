30|$|Hence, the ill-advised {{unilateral}} {{focus of}} European regulation on CO 2 with low emphasis on toxic emissions {{as compared to}} US or Japanese legislation cannot be blamed alone at stakeholders at the European level. The European Commission launched another attempt to align fuel taxes in 2011. With the revision of the Energy Taxation Directive, the Commission's proposal again was to tax fuels in a neutral way and to ensure a fair competition in the internal market. All fuels would compete {{on the basis of}} their carbon content instead of tax advantages. Even the proposal expressively ‘did not seek to penalize diesel but to tax fuels in a neutral way {{on the basis of their}} merits instead of tax advantages’ (EU Taxation Commissioner Algirdas Šemeta in[114]), it resulted in shifting the litre price level of diesel above the petrol price level according to the higher energy content of the former.

50|$|Following {{the success}} of the coup, which counted on the Romanian {{neutrality}} and the tacit support of the British and the Italians, on 7 August 1919 Friedrich was named prime minister while the archduke became regent. After a one-week <b>transitional</b> <b>period</b> lasting <b>until</b> 15 August, his cabinet was composed primarily of former members of the government of Prime Minister Mihály Károlyi, belonging mainly to the more conservative wing of his Independence Party, which had split during his rule. Friedrich founded his own party Christian National Party (KNP) but it did not have mass support. He was far {{to the left of the}} counter-revolutionaries who had plotted the coup against the Peidl government and attempted to carry out, ultimately unsuccessfully, the moderate program that had originally been proposed at the beginning of the government of Károlyi. His government was even weaker than Peidl's and was little more than a collection of conspirators and unknown figures, without members of the nobility that could serve to attract the counterrevolutionary right. The cabinet could not count on British nor Italian military aid, given the practical absence of troops from these countries in the capital, nor could it count on Romanian aid, whose units occupied the city and the eastern territories. The government of Bucharest refused to recognise the Friedrich cabinet. The government of Szeged and the French, for their part, almost immediately tried to do away with the Friedrich government or, if this was impossible, to alter its composition. The neighbouring states, fearful of a restoration of the Habsburgs, supported the French position and showed their opposition to the appointment of Archduke Joseph.|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine the level of relevance of the economic development and the level of pollution of thirteen states that joined the European Union (EU) in the last three enlargement rounds (2004, 2007, and 2013), with the length of <b>transitional</b> <b>periods,</b> i. e. the number of regulations that have agreed <b>transitional</b> <b>periods.</b> The initial assumption is that the level of economic development of countries joining the EU and the level of pollution are affecting the length of <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> and the number of regulations that are agreed upon <b>transitional</b> <b>periods.</b> Accordingly, the paper points to the level of economic development (measured by GDP) and the level of pollution (emissions measured by CO 2 /pc and CO 2 /gdp). All the states are grouped into five regional groups (Mediterranean, Central Europe, the Baltics, South-East Europe and the member states of the former Yugoslavia). Separate part of the paper analyzes in detail the types of regulations relating to the agreed <b>transitional</b> <b>periods,</b> and the number and length of <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> that are contracted by the states of the five groups. For the analysis we used the <b>transitional</b> <b>periods</b> in the field of energy, environment and transport, given their potential importance for CO 2 emissions.

50|$|Throughout the 1990s, the Chinese Football Association were {{demanding}} more professionalism from their football teams. Guangzhou {{was one of}} the first fully professional football clubs in China after the Apollo Group took over the club on 8 January 1993. The investment aided the manager Zhou Suian to help create a competitive squad. Hu Zhijun won the top goalscoring award. Guangzhou were able to gain a runners-up spot at the 1994 league season. The following season Zhou Suian left the team after having twice guided the club to a runners-up position within the league and a runners up spot against Shanghai in the 1991 Chinese FA Cup. After his exit, the club were unable to replicate the same results. When influential international footballers Peng Weiguo and Hu Zhijun left the club, the team went into free fall and were relegated at the end of the 1998 league season. With the management concerned about the team's performance, an investigation was launched which discovered that Wen Junwu and three other players were in collusion with gambling groups and were immediately expelled from the club. In 2001, the Guangzhou Sports Bureau took over the club again. With significant investment coming from the Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., Ltd it was hoped that the club could push for promotion. The division was rocked by a match-fixing scandal involving Changchun Yatai, Chengdu Wuniu, Jiangsu Sainty and Zhejing Greentown. Guangzhou's new sponsors Geely immediately pulled their funding from the team to distance themselves from the bad publicity. The club went through a tough <b>transitional</b> <b>period</b> <b>until</b> the Sunray Cave Group took over the club in 2004 and started to invest money in hopes of pushing for promotion. When the Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals group took over the club in 2006, they were able to realize the ambition of gaining promotion. The club won the 2007 division title and entry to the Chinese Super League.In February 2010, Guangzhou was relegated back to the China League One in the fallout of a match-fixing scandal despite having achieved a ninth-place finish in the 2009 season. The match in question was the 19 August 2006 league game against Shanxi Luhu, which Guangzhou won 5-1 when they were still playing in the China League One. It was discovered by the police that the Guangzhou general manager Yang Xu paid ¥200,000 to the opposing general manager Wang Po to secure a win at home and that Guangzhou's vice president's Wu Xiaodong and Xie Bin knew about it. With the offending participants sentenced to jail for fraud, the club was put up for sale. On 28 February 2010, Evergrande Real Estate Group took over the club for a fee of ¥100 million. Xu Jiayin, chairman of Evergrande Real Estate Group, said that they would pump more funds into the transfer market. His first act was to sign in Chinese national team striker Gao Lin from Shanghai Shenhua for a reported fee of ¥6 million, then he replaced the head coach Peng Weiguo with former Beijing Guoan manager Lee Jang-Soo with no indication. In the 2010 summer transfer window, the club signed Sun Xiang, the first Chinese footballer to play in the UEFA Champions League with PSV Eindhoven, and Chinese national team captain Zheng Zhi on 28 June 2010. On 30 June 2010, Guangzhou confirmed that they had signed Muriqui on a four-year deal from Campeonato Brasileiro Série A side Atlético Mineiro with a domestic record fee of ¥23 million. On 30 October 2010, Guangzhou became League One champions for the second time and returned to the Super League after a 3-1 win against Hunan Billows.|$|E

However, the social partners continued to negotiate a general agreement on starting pay and minimum basic pay increases as well as inflation safeguard clause that would apply to all workers in the private sector who were not covered by sectoral collective agreements or whose sectoral collective agreement did not determine the pay adjustment supplement. The sectoral agreements were required by law to set terms at least as favorable as those in the general intersectoral agreement 8.|$|E

I have presented the techniques of treating mixed municipal waste, a circular economy, material flows of certain types of waste, the 5 or 6 steps of waste management, as well as the Zero Waste movement and how to join this movement. The ‘Loči. me’ (‘separate me’) application was developed to promote the correct sorting of waste and encourage people to separate their waste.
