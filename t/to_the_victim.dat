5|$|Although the convulsions {{caused by}} {{central nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} may lead to incidental injury <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim,</b> it remained uncertain for many years whether damage to the nervous system following the seizure could occur and several studies searched for evidence of such damage. An overview of these studies by Bitterman in 2004 concluded that following removal of breathing gas containing high fractions of oxygen, no long-term neurological damage from the seizure remains.|$|E
5|$|Ostrom {{suggested}} that Deinonychus could kick with the sickle claw {{to cut and}} slash at its prey. Some researchers even {{suggested that}} the talon was used to disembowel large ceratopsian dinosaurs. Other {{studies have suggested that}} the sickle claws were not used to slash but rather to deliver small stabs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> In 2005, Manning and colleagues ran tests on a robotic replica that precisely matched the anatomy of Deinonychus and Velociraptor, and used hydraulic rams to make the robot strike a pig carcass. In these tests, the talons made only shallow punctures and could not cut or slash. The authors suggested that the talons would have been more effective in climbing than in dealing killing blows.|$|E

5|$|On 30 March 2017, Édouard was {{suspected}} of having shot at a passer-by with an airsoft gun on 11 February, injuring him in the head. As {{a result of the}} incident, he was interrogated by police and his loan was prematurely terminated by Toulouse. At the time of his loan being cancelled, Edouard had made 17 appearances and scored one goal for Toulouse. It was later revealed that his teammate, Mathieu Cafaro, had confessed to being the one who had fired the gun. Cafaro later recanted, however, and on 13 June the Toulouse Prosecutor asked that Édouard be charged with a four months suspended prison sentence and a €6,000 fine for his involvement in the incident. Édouard alleged that Cafaro fired the shot while Cafaro claimed not to have been in the car {{at the time of the}} shooting. On 4 July, Édouard was sentenced to a suspended four months' prison sentence by the Correctional Court of Toulouse. He was also ordered to pay a fine of €6,000 as well as damages of €2,600 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim</b> for the wounds suffered to his ear.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} an amplified DDoS attack through NTP is through a command called monlist, which sends {{the details of the}} last 600 people who have {{requested}} the time from that computer back to the requester. A small request to this time server can be sent using a spoofed source IP address of some victim, which results in 556.9 times the amount of data that was requested back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> This becomes amplified when using botnets that all send requests with the same spoofed IP source, which will send a massive amount of data back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{computer}} network security, backscatter is a side-effect of a spoofed denial-of-service attack. In {{this kind of}} attack, the attacker spoofs (or forges) the source address in IP packets sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>victim.</b> In general, the victim machine cannot distinguish between the spoofed packets and legitimate packets, so the victim responds to the spoofed packets as it normally would. These response packets are known as backscatter.|$|E
