5|$|Interest in Banak {{rose with}} the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948 {{and fears of}} Soviet {{intervention}} in Norway. Finnmark, located on the Norway–Soviet Union border, became of particular interest for the military. Although specific plans were articulated, no construction of an airbase was carried out. However, Norway's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 had a dramatic effect on the military strategy and Banak. Finnmark {{was regarded as a}} <b>tripwire</b> and was to be sacrificed in case of a Soviet invasion. The airfield was closed in 1952, but the runway remained, consisting of a short section of unmaintained wooden runway and the rest a grass strip. It was occasionally used by small aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Doink the Clown had annoyed Bam Bam Bigelow {{throughout}} October and November {{with such}} pranks as throwing water and confetti {{on him and}} dumping a pail of water on Bigelow's on-screen girlfriend Luna Vachon. He also tied a <b>tripwire</b> across the aisle during one of Bigelow's matches; after Bigelow fell over the wire, Doink attacked him with a broom. Bigelow responded by coming to the ring during one of Doink's matches and destroying Doink's toy wagon. The character of Doink was played by several wrestlers, who occasionally appeared at the same time. The match booked for Survivor Series advertised Bigelow teaming with Bastion Booger, who portrayed an overweight and dirty glutton, and The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu), a team of Samoans who were portrayed as savages, to face four Doinks. To promote the match, Doink appeared on the video wall {{that was part of}} the set during Bigelow's matches leading up to the event. The wall used a split screen to show multiple Doinks talking and laughing at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Explosive booby traps {{were also}} employed, some command detonated by hidden observers. They ranged from single bullets, to grenades, to dud bombs and shells. Anti-vehicle traps ranged from mines to buried {{artillery}} rounds. Helicopter traps were often deployed in trees surrounding a potential landing zone, triggered by an observer, or the rotor's wash. Booby traps were also made from American and ARVN trash in the field. Discarded ration cans, for example, were loaded with grenades that had pins pulled partially – {{the other end}} connected to <b>tripwire.</b> The sides of the can held the pin in place until the <b>tripwire</b> was activated. Discarded batteries and communications wire was also used – the batteries hooked to the waste wire, providing an ignition current to spark the charge of dud or discarded mortar/artillery rounds.|$|E
50|$|Silly String {{and similar}} {{products}} {{have been used by}} American and British military forces to detect <b>tripwires</b> for explosive booby traps. The string is sprayed over the suspected area, and if the string falls to the ground, no <b>tripwires</b> are present since the string would catch on the <b>tripwires</b> (but is not heavy enough to activate the explosive).|$|R

40|$|The {{threat from}} {{insiders}} is an ever-growing concern for organisations, {{and in recent}} years the harm that insiders pose has been widely demonstrated. This paper describes our recent work into how we might support insider threat detection when actions are taken which can be immediately determined as of concern because they fall into one of two categories: they violate a policy which is specifically crafted to describe behaviours that are highly likely to be of concern if they are exhibited, or they exhibit behaviours which follow a pattern of a known insider threat attack. In particular, we view these concerning actions as something that we can design and implement <b>tripwires</b> within a system to detect. We then orchestrate these <b>tripwires</b> in conjunction with an anomaly detection system and present an approach to formalising <b>tripwires</b> of both categories. Our intention being that by having a single framework for describing them, alongside a library of existing <b>tripwires</b> in use, we can provide the community of practitioners and researchers with the basis to document and evolve this common understanding of <b>tripwires...</b>|$|R
25|$|In 2008, Royal Marine Reservist Lance Corporal Matthew Croucher {{received}} the George Cross {{for his actions}} whilst deployed with 40 Commando in Afghanistan.

Fortunately he managed to cushion {{the majority of the}} blast with his Bergen whilst his body armour stopped further shrapnel, this left him with only minor injuries and his fellow Marines unharmed.|$|E
500|$|... "Voices Carry" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} pop music critics. In {{a review of}} the band's second album Welcome Home, David Wild from Rolling Stone magazine said that their [...] "debut , Voices Carry, had its icy charms", calling the song [...] "wonderfully eerie". [...] Allmusic's Stewart Mason said that [...] "'Voices Carry' {{is one of the most}} distinctive radio singles of its era"; he also praised the production saying that it [...] "does wonders both for Mann's breathy voice and the [...] chorus, which brilliantly releases the tension that builds throughout the stark, paranoid verses". Joe Viglione also from Allmusic, in {{a review of the}}ir debut album said that the song is [...] "captivating", and praised its production saying that Mike Thorne did an [...] "excellent work".

500|$|Though {{direct sales}} from Steam are unknown, the Potato Sack ARG helped to boost {{sales of the}} {{independent}} games. [...] The whole Potato Sack promotion was the second-highest selling compilation on Steam in the week prior to Portal 2s release, following Portal 2 itself and ahead of the Potato Sack/Portal 2 bundle. Dylan Fitterer, programmer for Audiosurf, noted that during the promotion, more than 6000 people were playing his game at a time, compared to 300 players before the event. Fitterer also saw an opportunity {{to create a new}} game based upon the ARG-themed addition to Audiosurf. Ichiro Lambe of Dejobaan Games was also pleased with the sales increased; while not a windfall, it helped him to continue to live comfortably. Thomas Grip of Frictional Games claimed that the boost of sales for Amnesia within the first two days of the Potato Sack sale completely covered the development costs for the added [...] "Justine" [...] content they had developed for the ARG. John Gibson of <b>Tripwire</b> Interactive believed that similar ARGs could be run in the future without the presence of a major title like Portal 2 {{as long as there is}} a significant payoff for the players.|$|E

Even if the mine does not self-destruct, the battery will fully discharge after 14 days, rendering the mine inactive.|$|R
40|$|The {{threat that}} organisations face from within is growing significantly, {{as it has}} been widely {{demonstrated}} by the harm that insiders have caused recently. For many years the security community has invested in barriers and perimeters, of increasing sophistication, designed to keep those with malign intent outside of the organisations’ information infrastructures. But assuming that one can keep the threat out of an organisation is simply not a practical stance to adopt. In our research we are concerning ourselves with how technology might be deployed to help with the detection of insider threats both automatically and in support of human-led mechanisms. This paper describes our recent research into how we might support threat detection when actions taken can be immediately determined as of concern. In particular we capture actions that fall into one of two categories: those that violate a policy which is specifically crafted to describe behaviours that should be avoided; or those that exhibit behaviours which follow a pattern of a known insider-threat attack. We view these concerning actions as something that we can design and implement <b>tripwires</b> within a system to detect. We then orchestrate these <b>tripwires</b> in conjunction with an anomaly detection system. We present a review of the security policies organisation apply and a grammar to describe <b>tripwires.</b> We further validate our grammar by formalising the most common <b>tripwires</b> for both categories. Our aim is to provide a single framework for unambiguously capturing <b>tripwires,</b> alongside a library of existing ones in use. Therefore, <b>tripwires</b> may be used to map experiences regardless of the heterogeneity of the security tools and practices deployed...|$|R

2500|$|In 1970, the East Germans {{began to}} {{introduce}} the SM-70 (Splittermine-70) directional anti-personnel mine, mounted on the border fence itself. Some 60,000SM-70s were eventually installed. It was given various descriptions in the West such as [...] "spring gun" [...] or [...] "self-firing device", though to the East Germans, it {{was known as the}} [...] "automated firing device" [...] (Selbstschußapparat). The device consisted of a horizontally oriented cone filled with [...] of TNT explosive into which was embedded approximately 80small sharp-edged steel cubes. It was fitted to the inward-facing side of the border fence at intervals of around [...] The device was triggered if the <b>tripwire</b> connected to the firing mechanism was pulled or cut. It was potentially lethal to a maximum range of around , though its effective lethal range was 25 metres (82ft). On one occasion, when a deer fell victim to an SM-70, an observer noted that [...] "an approximately 5 meter area appeared {{as if it had been}} worked over by a rake." [...] By 1976, SM-70s had been installed along 248km of the border and conventional minefields lined another 491km. The mines were eventually removed by the end of 1984 in the face of international condemnation of the East German government.|$|E
2500|$|The term rootkit or root kit {{originally}} {{referred to}} a maliciously modified set of administrative tools for a Unix-like operating system that granted [...] "root" [...] access. If an intruder could replace the standard administrative tools on a system with a rootkit, the intruder could obtain root access over the system whilst simultaneously concealing these activities from the legitimate system administrator. These first-generation rootkits were trivial to detect by using tools such as <b>Tripwire</b> {{that had not been}} compromised to access the same information. Lane Davis and Steven Dake wrote the earliest known rootkit in 1990 for Sun Microsystems' SunOS UNIX operating system. In the lecture he gave upon receiving the Turing award in 1983, Ken Thompson of Bell Labs, one of the creators of Unix, theorized about subverting the C compiler in a Unix distribution and discussed the exploit. The modified compiler would detect attempts to compile the Unix login command and generate altered code that would accept not only the user's correct password, but an additional [...] "backdoor" [...] password known to the attacker. Additionally, the compiler would detect attempts to compile {{a new version of the}} compiler, and would insert the same exploits into the new compiler. A review of the source code for the login command or the updated compiler would not reveal any malicious code. This exploit was equivalent to a rootkit.|$|E
