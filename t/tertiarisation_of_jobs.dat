40|$|The economic, {{social and}} {{regional}} {{developments in the}} new German federal states are determined by high financial grants -esp. from the German government or the European Union. So far the build-up of a sustainable economic structure for these peripheral regional areas is as unsatisfactory as the status of efficient networks of service providers, suppliers and producers. The industrial downfall in the new German federal states in the early 90 th was not followed by alternative re-industrialization or relevant <b>tertiarisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs.</b> Consequently, the decay of structurally relevant economic branches has induced {{the need for the}} development of new region-specific competencies (e. g. in R&D). The re-definition of an efficient, competitive and timely achievable economic structure is urgently required. However, the future composition of the general economical framework must be based on a realistic assessment of achievable targets and should not be driven by unrealistic assumptions. There are different options for an individual development of these peripheral regional areas, depending on available capabilities: · advancement of existing industrial profiles · settlement of new industrial branches · promotion of traditional regional industries · cooperation with established metropolitan structures The achievement of regional economic stability is the ultimate goal and an undispensable prerequisite to ascertain sustainable economic growth. This stability can only be secured by competitive enterprises. Structural changes -even with the consequence of temporary negative growth under these conditions- has {{to be seen as a}} chance for the economic stability of these regions...|$|E

40|$|An {{empirical}} {{model has been}} deployed to account for regional industrial growth and performance in Greece’s post EU-accession period. The results obtained suggest {{that the effect of}} European integration on manufacturing has been rather adverse across Greek regions. Regions that are more industrialised, whose structure was more similar to the European average and which have been more exposed to European competition are those that have been more adversely affected. In contrast, higher diversity, higher presence of capital intensive sectors and higher <b>tertiarisation</b> <b>of</b> the regional economies were found to be beneficial to regional industrial growth and performance. ...|$|R

Observing that individual factors strongly interact with local policies and institutions in determining women’s employment, we claim that any attempt to explore solely its supply-side determinants might lead to biased estimates. Aggregate growth and <b>tertiarisation</b> <b>of</b> the economy are surprisingly found beneficial only to men’s employment, while culture and discrimination are relevant for women’s. Social Assistance is found highly significant, with the provision of services being more beneficial to women’s employment than monetary transfers...|$|R

This paper aims to explain the events that occurred between 2005 and 2010, focusing on analysing the region’s productive struc-ture and how it is reflected in its labour market. To do so, a linear SAM model is employed to identify strategic sectors, and their employment trends are then studied through shift-share analysis. The results show the pro-gressive <b>tertiarisation</b> <b>of</b> the Andalusian economy, a regional countercyclical effect that is lower than the national average and sectoral effects on employ-ment in the strategic sectors...|$|R

40|$|The process <b>of</b> <b>tertiarisation</b> <b>of</b> our economies {{is taking}} place along with the {{ever-increasing}} pervasiveness of {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs). ICTs, in turn, are becoming "convergent" as they share a common basis, namely digital technology. This common basis is becoming so important that it has engendered the need to add a new dimension to the original Smithian idea of the division of labour, i. e. we {{have to take into account}} the new forms of the digital division of labour. This work therefore considers the broad process of structural economic dynamics which is engendered by the processes of digitization of our economies, taking the 1960 s as a starting point.         JEL Codes: O 33, L 86, L 80 Keywords: Technology, Technologies</p...|$|R

But in developing countries, labour market deformities may push people into service economy out of distress also. This paper examines the tertiarisation process in Indian labour market {{to bring out the}} reasons behind such trends and the likely impact of such movements. It is observed that the employment growth in the tertiary sector had been dynamic and growth-induced during the eighties, but in the recent times has turned distress-driven. Sub-sectors within the tertiary sector are behaving differently indicating the heterogeneity of this sector. Policymakers should note these issues and take appropriate steps not only to boost high-end jobs but also to improve productivity and returns in low-end jobs. Then only tertiary sector revolution in India will be beneficial to the workers en masse and be sustainable. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the decade}} before the present, world {{financial}} crisis exports out of Germany expanded enormously. This {{was caused by}} the growing world demand as well as the internationalization of the national production processes and favoured by the improving price competitiveness. At the same time, against the background <b>of</b> the <b>tertiarisation</b> <b>of</b> the economy, the qualification of employees has increased considerably. In our study, we investigate the changes of labour quality in the production of export goods using the standard open input-output model. Hereby, labour input is measured in terms of different formal qualification levels of the employees. The results are compared with the labour input for imported goods. We find out that the input of high qualified labour per unit of produced export goods exceeds only marginally the comparable input value of the imports. It should be mentioned that the comparison is strongly influenced by the assumption of identical production functions for both Germany and its trading partners. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{begins with}} a {{quantitative}} analysis of post-World War II strike activity {{in a group of}} European countries and the United States. The analysis highlights two important changes. First, over the past two decades, and particularly during the 1990 s, there was a significant decrease in strike activity in the countries surveyed (with the notable exception of Denmark). Secondly, there has been a strong trend towards the so-called <b>tertiarisation</b> <b>of</b> conflict. This raises major problems for the measurement, analysis and regulation of strike activity, the strength of tertiary conflicts being based not on the number of days lost or the number of stri-kers involved, but on the extent of harm caused to the users of services. The impact of tertiary conflict varies from one country to another, in line with the different national regulatory mechanisms, national institutions and national styles of industrial relations.
