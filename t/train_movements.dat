5|$|In 1895, the Fitchburg and B {{demolished}} the 1848-built union station. Two new station buildings {{opened to}} replace it: a passenger station (the {{centerpiece of the}} new Depot Square) in {{the northeast corner of}} the junction, and a freight station in the southeast which replaced the formerly separate freight houses. In 1897, the junction of the P was relocated slightly to the west to eliminate angled grade crossings of Main Street and Park Street. An island platform was constructed around that time between the two Fitchburg main tracks east of the diamond crossing to serve commuters to Boston. In 1906, East Main Street was rerouted onto a bridge east of the station, eliminating traffic problems caused when trains blocked the grade crossing. The old Stony Brook freight house and engine house were removed as part of the construction. Two signal bridges built at right angles over the junction in the 1910s and an interlocking tower built in 1929 controlled the various <b>train</b> <b>movements</b> across the complex junction.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, the MTA has started several {{projects}} to maintain and improve the subway. In the 1990s, it started converting the BMT Canarsie Line to use communications-based train control, utilizing a moving block signal system that allowed more trains to use the tracks and thus increasing passenger capacity. After the Canarsie Line tests were successful, the MTA expanded the automation program in the 2000s and 2010s to include other lines. As part of another program called FASTRACK, the MTA started closing certain lines during weekday nights in 2012, {{with each of the}} lines closing overnight for a week in order to allow workers to clean these lines without being hindered by <b>train</b> <b>movements.</b> It expanded the program beyond Manhattan the next year after noticing how efficient the FASTRACK program was compared to previous service diversions. In 2015, the MTA announced a wide-ranging improvement program as part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program. Thirty stations would be extensively rebuilt under the Enhanced Station Initiative, and new R211 subway cars would be able to fit more passengers.|$|E
25|$|Traffic and <b>train</b> <b>movements</b> are {{controlled}} from Llanberis: communication between Llanberis, Clogwyn and the Summit, {{as well as}} to trains' guards, is by two-way radio.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the events}} are placed along {{the axis of}} <b>train</b> <b>movement,</b> their time {{coordinates}} become projected to different time coordinates in the moving train's inertial frame. Events which occurred at space coordinates {{in the direction of}} <b>train</b> <b>movement</b> (in the stationary frame), happen earlier than events at coordinates opposite to the direction of <b>train</b> <b>movement.</b> In the moving train's inertial frame, this means that lightning will strike the front of the train car before two observers align (face each other).|$|R
50|$|While {{the tracks}} and {{interlocking}} plant at this location are signalized to alert locomotive engineers when the interlocking switches are set for through track <b>train</b> <b>movement,</b> the switches are not designed to de-rail a locomotive or train that runs through them when they are aligned for through track <b>train</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} to {{demonstrate}} the use of MATLAB Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for developing Multi-Train Movement Simulation (MTMS). Dynamic performance of the <b>train</b> <b>movement</b> is modeled {{with the help of}} Newton’s law of motion. <b>Train</b> <b>movement</b> in this work is based on a sequence of four operating modes: i) accelerating mode, ii) constant speed or cruising mode, iii) coasting mode and iv) braking mode. The design concept of a <b>train</b> <b>movement</b> class is described with its properties and methods. To evaluate its use, the proposed <b>train</b> <b>movement</b> simulator developed here is tested against Bangkok Transit System (BTS) – Sky Train Silom Line. This system has the service distance of 13 -km and is fed by seven 750 -V DC power sources through its 3 rd rail. The results showed the effectiveness of the proposed simulator...|$|R
25|$|Subsidiary {{signals are}} those which usually control only {{shunting}} moves, {{as opposed to}} <b>train</b> <b>movements.</b> Under this category come permissive signals and shunting signals.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{there are}} up to 22 weekday freight <b>train</b> <b>{{movements}}</b> per day through the Kaimai Tunnel, and up to 19 movements per day during the weekends. Freight transported over this route includes inter-port container traffic, timber and timber products, coal, manufactured goods, and petroleum.|$|E
25|$|Part of the {{programme}} included resignalling {{the lines}} between Belfast, Greenisland and Mossley Junction with automatic colourlight signals. A new signal cabin was built at Greenisland to control <b>train</b> <b>movements</b> over the triangle formed by the Loop Line, Larne Line and the Back Line.|$|E

25|$|The route {{was changed}} to 63rd Street because {{officials}} of the Rockefeller Institute at 64th Street feared that heavy construction and later <b>train</b> <b>movements</b> {{so close to the}} Institute's buildings might have adversely affected delicate instruments at the Institute and change the accuracy of the research being conducted.|$|E
25|$|A Duty Officer is {{rostered}} {{whenever a}} passenger {{service is in}} operation. The Duty Officer regulates train running, overseeing the staff signalling system and giving permission for trains to enter the single line sections, recording <b>train</b> <b>movements</b> on the Train Graph and ensuring trains are formed of an appropriate number of carriages.|$|E
25|$|The heavy-capacity trains have steel {{wheels and}} are {{operated}} by an on-board train operator. The trains are computer-controlled. The operator, {{who is both}} motorman and conductor, is responsible for opening and closing the doors and making announcements. ATC controls all <b>train</b> <b>movements,</b> including braking, acceleration and speed control, but can be manually overridden by the operator {{in the case of}} an emergency.|$|E

50|$|Kiryat Gat - fires erupted at {{two points}} near the Kiryat Gat {{intersection}} {{in the morning}} of November 25. The main road in the city was closed and the <b>train</b> <b>movement</b> was canceled.|$|R
25|$|The Federal Government {{was expecting}} an {{increase}} of traffic of 1.8 million additional passengers per year after completion, generating almost 800 million passenger-kilometres. The forecast {{is based on a}} shift of approximately one million passenger journeys from the road and some 700,000 from the air (as of 2006). DB Netz planned (as of 2002) to spend €37.3million per year after the opening of the line on a system for collecting data on <b>train</b> <b>movements.</b>|$|E
25|$|Points {{indicators}} are provided at junctions {{to indicate the}} route which is set through the points. At junctions, where Supertram and <b>train</b> <b>movements</b> can conflict with road traffic, fixed signals are provided in addition to points indicators. A points indicator may only be passed if it displays the correct route indication for the tram concerned and, where fixed signals are provided, if both points indicators and fixed signals are set for the correct route.|$|E
25|$|Whereas {{lineside signals}} {{operated}} by a signaller would control <b>train</b> <b>movements,</b> ETCS will signal trains via a computer without lineside apparatus. In effect, the train creates its own 'buffer zone' through a digital signal transmitted from the cab. An onboard computer on the train will inform {{the driver of the}} 'allowable speed and movement of the train.' TMS allows delays to be minimised through a computer running algorithms and deciding how best to return traffic patterns to normal.|$|E
50|$|The CROR {{rules are}} {{intended}} to enhance railway safety. The rules cover employee responsibilities, signalling equipment, procedures for safe <b>train</b> <b>movement,</b> dealing with accidents and other topics that directly and indirectly affect railway safety.|$|R

25|$|The {{terminal}} was {{an architectural}} and engineering marvel of its time, designed with ramps to allow pedestrian traffic to flow {{in and out}} of the station quickly and easily. The station was served by two single-track tubes connected by a loop to speed <b>train</b> <b>movements.</b> The loop included five tracks and 3 platforms (2 center island and one side) and was somewhat similar to the current arrangement. By 1914, passenger volume at the Hudson Terminal had reached 30,535,500 annually. Volume nearly doubled by 1922, with 59,221,354 passengers that year.|$|E
25|$|After Croton Falls station, the Harlem Line {{runs along}} East Branch Reservoir and crosses into Putnam County and its rural landscape. Above Southeast station (formerly Brewster North), the {{railroad}} passes under Interstate 84 {{and through the}} yards at Putnam Junction. This is the northern boundary of third rail electrification. Diesel territory and single track operation begins here. The Wassaic Branch is not signalized, and manual block system rules are used to direct <b>train</b> <b>movements.</b> The track finally follows its own course, away from any road or river, past the abandoned Towners station up to Patterson and into Dutchess County.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the onset}} of Operation Reinhard which marked the most deadly phase of the Holocaust in Poland many Jews were transported by road to killing sites such as the Chełmno {{extermination}} camp, equipped with gas vans. In 1942, stationary gas chambers were built at Treblinka, Belzec, Sobibor, Majdanek and Auschwitz. After the Nazi takeover of prewar Polish railway company PKP, the <b>train</b> <b>movements,</b> originating inside and outside occupied Poland and terminating at death camps, were tracked by Dehomag using IBM-supplied card-reading machines and traditional waybills produced by the Reichsbahn. The Holocaust trains were always managed and directed by native German SS men posted with that express' role throughout the system.|$|E

25|$|On July 24, 1992, the Harrisburg {{chapter of}} the National Railway Historical Society {{purchased}} Harris Tower from Amtrak. The chapter opened the tower {{to the public as}} a museum, as well as allow visitors to operate the interlocking machine. Instead of controlling a network of signals and switches, it is connected to a computer which simulates <b>train</b> <b>movements</b> through the interlocking. The simulation uses Pennsylvania Railroad timetables from the early 1940s when the rail traffic at the tower was busiest. The tower is popular with railfans as an observation point for the numerous Amtrak and Norfolk Southern trains that regularly pass it. The tower was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 30, 1994.|$|E
25|$|In {{the centre}} of the country, the populations of Ramla on the Jaffa – Jerusalem line and Lydda where this line joined the Haifa – El Kantara main line had large Arab majorities, who blocked Israelis from using {{railways}} or roads through this key area. One of the few <b>train</b> <b>movements</b> here after the British withdrawal was in July 1948 when Israeli forces launched Operation Danny to expel the Arab populations of Lydda and Ramla. When the Arab defenders blockaded the railway to help defend Lydda, an Israeli force reportedly used S100 0-6-0T number 21 as a battering ram to breach the fortifications. Although Operation Danny succeeded in forcing at least 50,000 Arab residents to leave Lydda and Ramla, the military situation between Ramla and Jerusalem still prevented the restoration of regular trains on that line until March 1950.|$|E
25|$|So far as Edinburgh's guided {{transportation}} systems are concerned, the troubled tramway scheme for Edinburgh has enjoyed the limelight for some years. First seriously planned in 2003, {{the emphasis was}} on connecting the airport and northern suburbs to the city centre although a branch route to Newcraighall was contemplated, and later dropped. None of the proposals involved running on the Suburban Line, although a tram-train solution has been advocated by a special interest group: this would have involved vehicles running on the Suburban Line and transferring to street running to achieve a more direct and convenient access to the city centre. This {{would have had the}} incidental advantage of avoiding adding to the <b>train</b> <b>movements</b> on the congested four-track section of the main line from Haymarket to Waverley, but would of course have constrained the route options on the South Side.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} <b>train</b> <b>movement</b> model with fixed runtime {{that can be}} {{employed}} to find feasible control strategies for a single train along an inter-city railway line. The objective of the model is to minimize arrival delays at each station along railway lines. However, <b>train</b> <b>movement</b> is a typical nonlinear problem for complex running environments and different requirements. A heuristic algorithm is developed {{to solve the problem}} in this paper and the simulation results show that the train could overcome the disturbance from train delay and coordinates the operation strategies to sure punctual arrival of trains at the destination. The developed algorithm {{can also be used to}} evaluate the running reliability of trains in scheduled timetables...|$|R
5000|$|The {{current era}} in {{graffiti}} {{is characterized by}} a majority of graffiti artists moving from train carriages to [...] "street galleries." [...] The Clean <b>Train</b> <b>Movement</b> started in May 1989, when New York City attempted to remove all of the subway cars found with graffiti on them out of the transit system, as they brought in new graffiti-free rolling stock like the R62, R62A, R68, and R68A. Because of this, many graffiti artists were unable to continue vandalizing them. Much controversy arose among the streets debating whether graffiti should be considered an actual form of art. Videograf Productions was the first graffiti video series to document the New York City's clean <b>train</b> <b>movement.</b>|$|R
