Believing that the <b>two</b> <b>guards</b> could be none other than Rama and Lakshmana, Tulsidas was aggrieved to know that they were guarding his home at night.

5|$|Around {{midnight on}} Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled {{up near the}} side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited {{for at least an}} hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a St. Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard. The <b>two</b> <b>guards</b> were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained to do this to ensure the door was locked.

5|$|Between March 1926 and September 1928, the CLR {{converted}} the remaining gate stock carriages in phases. The end platforms were enclosed {{to provide additional}} passenger accommodation and two sliding doors were inserting in each side. The conversions increased capacity and allowed the CLR to remove gatemen from the train crews, with responsibility for controlling doors moving to the <b>two</b> <b>guards</b> who each managed half the train. Finally, the introduction of driver/guard communications in 1928 allowed the CLR to dispense with the second guard, reducing a train crew to just a driver and a guard. The addition of doors in the sides of cars caused problems at Wood Lane where {{the length of the}} platform {{on the inside of the}} returning curve was limited by an adjacent access track into the depot. The problem was solved by the introduction of a pivoted section of platform which usually sat above the access track and allowed passengers to board trains as normal, but which could be moved to allow access to the depot.|$|E
