40|$|ObjectiveThe {{mammalian}} <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin {{signaling pathway}} has {{been implicated in}} therapeutic resistance in several types of cancer. However, the significance <b>of</b> mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin activation in chemoradiotherapy sensitivity {{and its effect on}} the prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with chemoradiotherapy remain unknown. However, this pathway is of particular interest because an effective inhibitor is available. MethodsBy using immunohistochemistry, phosphorylated mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin expression was examined in 77 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery between 1999 and 2009, and correlated with treatment outcome. With the use of CE 81 T/VGH and TE 2 cell lines, cells were treated with chemotherapy, temsirolimus (mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin inhibitor), or a combination of chemotherapy and temsirolimus, and investigated by 3 -(4. 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. ResultsPathologic complete response rates were 42 % and 16 % in patients with negative and positive phosphorylated mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin expression, respectively (P = . 01). The 3 -year overall survivals were 57 % and 30 % in patients with negative and positive phosphorylated mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin expression, respectively (P = . 005). Positive phosphorylated mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin expression was independently associated with inferior overall and disease-free survival. In patients who did not achieve pathologic complete response, postchemoradiotherapy esophagectomy specimens showed significantly higher phosphorylated mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin expression than pretreatment biopsy specimens. In cell lines, concomitant administration of temsirolimus enhanced the effect of chemotherapy. ConclusionsPhosphorylated mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin expression is independently associated with the response to chemoradiotherapy and prognosis of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated with preoperative chemoradiotherapy. Mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin inhibition can sensitize esophageal cancer cells to chemotherapy. Our results suggest the potential for mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin as a therapeutic target for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who receive multimodality treatment...|$|R

5|$|In plants, {{signaling}} by auxins, or phytohormones {{that order}} {{the direction and}} tropism of plant growth, induces the <b>targeting</b> <b>of</b> a class of transcription factor repressors known as Aux/IAA proteins for proteasomal degradation.

Degradation of Aux/IAA proteins derepresses transcription factors in the auxin-response factor (ARF) family and induces ARF-directed gene expression. The cellular consequences of ARF activation depend on the plant type and developmental stage, but are involved in directing growth in roots and leaf veins. The specific response to ARF derepression {{is thought to be}} mediated by specificity in the pairing of individual ARF and Aux/IAA proteins.|$|E

40|$|Background The {{mammalian}} <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin is a conserved {{protein kinase}} known to regulate protein synthesis, cell size and proliferation. Aberrant regulation <b>of</b> mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin activity {{has been observed}} in hematopoietic malignancies, including acute leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes, suggesting that correct regulation <b>of</b> mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin is critical for normal hematopoiesis. Design and Methods An ex vivo granulocyte differentiation system was utilized to investigate the role <b>of</b> mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin in the regulation of myelopoiesis. Results Inhibition <b>of</b> mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin activity, with the pharmacological inhibitor rapamycin, dramatically reduced hematopoietic progenitor expansion, without altering levels of apoptosis or maturation. Moreover, analysis of distinct hematopoietic progenitor populations revealed that rapamycin treatment inhibited the expansion potential of committed CD 34 (+) lineage-positive progenitors, but did not affect early hematopoietic progenitors. Further examinations showed that these effects of rapamycin on progenitor expansion might involve differential regulation of protein kinase B and mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin signaling. Conclusions Together, {{these results indicate that}} mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin activity is essential for expansion of CD 34 (+) hematopoietic progenitor cells during myelopoiesis. Modulation <b>of</b> the mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin pathway may be of benefit in the design of new therapies to control hematologic malignancies...|$|R

5|$|Lead-ions (Pb), like magnesium-ions (Mg), blocks NMDA receptors. Since {{the normal}} Pb {{concentration}} in the extracellular fluid is low (adult average of 120mg), even a low increase in Pb concentration has a significant positive affect on the blockage of NMDA-receptors. Therefore, an increase in Pb concentration, will, effectively, inhibit ongoing long-term potentiations (LTPs), and lead to an abnormal increase long-term depression (LDPs) on neurons on the effected parts of the nervous system. These abnormalities lead to the indirect downregulation of NMDA-receptors, effectively initiating a positive feedback-loop for LDP.

Her 2005 book Buried by the Times documents the paper's tendency before, during and after World War II to place deep inside its daily editions the news stories about the ongoing persecution and extermination of Jews, while obscuring in those stories the special impact of the Nazis' crimes on Jews in particular.

5|$|Organisms vary {{in their}} ability to take up foreign dsRNA and use it in the RNAi pathway. The effects of RNA {{interference}} can be both systemic and heritable in plants and C. elegans, although not in Drosophila or mammals. In plants, RNAi is thought to propagate by the transfer of siRNAs between cells through plasmodesmata (channels in the cell walls that enable communication and transport). Heritability comes from methylation of promoters targeted by RNAi; the new methylation pattern is copied in each new generation of the cell. A broad general distinction between plants and animals lies in the <b>targeting</b> <b>of</b> endogenously produced miRNAs; in plants, miRNAs are usually perfectly or nearly perfectly complementary to their target genes and induce direct mRNA cleavage by RISC, while animals' miRNAs tend to be more divergent in sequence and induce translational repression. This translational effect may be produced by inhibiting the interactions of translation initiation factors with the messenger RNA's polyadenine tail.|$|E

40|$|Impairment of {{reciprocal}} social interaction is a core symptom of autism spectrum disorder. Genetic disorders frequently accompany autism spectrum disorder, such as {{tuberous sclerosis complex}} caused by haploinsufficiency of the TSC 1 and TSC 2 genes. Accumulating evidence implicates a relationship between autism spectrum disorder and signal transduction that involves tuberous sclerosis complex 1, tuberous sclerosis complex 2 and mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin. Here we show behavioural abnormalities relevant to autism spectrum disorder and their recovery by the mammalian <b>target</b> <b>of</b> rapamycin inhibitor rapamycin in mouse models of tuberous sclerosis complex.

5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{molecular}} cues involved in the correct <b>targeting</b> <b>of</b> the migrating precursors remains a question. The secretion of a chemoattractant factor by the OB appears as a possibility. Chemoattractants and repellants act on the migrating neurons by inducing changes in the growth cone to direct them. Nevertheless, tissue derived from this structure had no directive influence on the migration. On the other hand, a septum-derived secreted factor showed a repulsive effect on the SVZ cells. More recently, {{it has been shown}} that the secreted molecule SLIT shows such a repelling effect on SVZ-derived precursors. Furthermore, integrins have been demonstrated to have a regulatory influence on precursor cell chain-migration and regulation of their divisions.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 This {{dissertation}} examines whether confronting prejudice for {{the greater}} good - confronting in a way that conveys the benefits of prejudice reduction to groups and institutions other than the <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice - can help <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice be taken more seriously by members of the perpetrating group. This dissertation first tested whether <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice are taken less seriously when they confront than members of the perpetrating group (i. e. allies). Two studies demonstrate that members of the perpetrating group (i. e., men, Whites) take confrontations by <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice (i. e., women, Blacks) less seriously than confrontations by allies and that these reactions may be explained by a tendency to attribute targets' confrontations to internal causes (i. e., tendencies to overreact). This dissertation next tested whether confronting {{for the greater}} good helps <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice to be taken more seriously when confronting. Four follow-up studies suggested that <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice were taken just as seriously as allies when confronting {{for the greater good}}. However, these latter experiments failed to replicate the effect that <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice who confront without using the greater good strategy are taken less seriously than allies who engage in the same confrontation. However, a meta-analysis of all studies demonstrated, across studies, confrontations by <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice were taken less seriously than confrontations by allies, while confrontations for the greater good were taken equally seriously for <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice and allies. As such, the individual studies in this dissertation may have failed to demonstrate the predicted effects {{due to a lack of}} power. This dissertation thus suggests that confronting for the greater good is one strategy that might help <b>targets</b> <b>of</b> prejudice to be taken seriously when they confront, although further research is needed to better understand the boundary conditions of this effect and should explore other strategies prejudice confronters might also use to be taken more seriously...|$|R
