5|$|In 1751, Caroline's {{daughter}} Princess Amelia became ranger of Richmond Park {{after the}} death of Robert Walpole. Immediately afterwards, the Princess caused major public uproar by closing <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>to</b> the public, only allowing few close friends and those with special permits to enter. This continued until 1758, when a local brewer, John Lewis, took the gatekeeper, who stopped him from entering <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> <b>to</b> court. The court ruled in favour of Lewis, citing the fact that, when Charles I enclosed the park in the 17th century, he allowed the public right of way in the park. Princess Amelia was forced to lift the restrictions.|$|E

50|$|CBS, in turn, sold <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Sandusky, Ohio-based {{amusement}} park management company Cedar Fair Entertainment Company on June 30, 2006 (CBS decided that <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> would not fit a new corporate strategy {{that they were}} implementing). As of January 2007, Cedar Fair has begun dropping the Paramount name from <b>the</b> individual <b>parks</b> and restoring their original KECO names with new Cedar Fair logos. This transaction also returned <b>the</b> <b>parks</b> <b>to</b> Ohio-based ownership, as Taft was once headquartered in Cincinnati (meanwhile, Gulf+Western was once headquartered in one of Ohio's neighboring states, Michigan).|$|R

5|$|In June 2004, Superman: The Escape's {{seat belts}} were {{modified}} {{because of an}} incident on the Superman – Ride of Steel roller coaster at Six Flags New England.

5|$|A mugging {{at gunpoint}} in 1854 reputedly {{led to the}} {{establishment}} of a park police force. Until 2005 the park was policed by the separate Royal Parks Constabulary but that has now been subsumed into the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit of the Metropolitan Police. The mounted police have been replaced by a patrol team in a four-wheel drive vehicle. In 2015 the Friends of Richmond Park expressed concern about plans to cut the numbers of police in <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>to</b> half the level that they were ten years previously, despite an increase in visitor numbers and in incidents of crime.|$|E
5|$|Alton Towers {{conceived}} {{the concept of}} a flying roller coaster in 1990, twelve years before Air eventually opened. Following the opening of Nemesis in 1994, a flying coaster was planned by <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>to</b> open in 1998, but was delayed due to technological limitations. During its development, Alton Towers marketed the ride as Secret Weapon 5 (abbreviated to SW5), following the naming pattern established for previous major park developments. The ride was developed in part by ride designer John Wardley, the producer of many attractions at Alton Towers and other former Tussauds Group theme parks.|$|E

5|$|Cedar Fair {{purchased}} the park from Six Flags in 2004 for $145 million. They announced intentions of returning <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>to</b> its roots as a family-oriented amusement park. The efforts to downsize the park {{eventually led to}} X-Flight's removal. On November 22, 2006, Geauga Lake park officials announced that X-Flight was being dismantled {{to be sent to}} another unspecified Cedar Fair property. Moving the ride would take some time, as the final sections of track and supports wouldn't be removed until March 2007.|$|E
5|$|During the Quaternary Period (2.6million {{years ago}} up to today), {{deposits}} of windblown sand and alluvium covered {{much of the}} Chinle and Bidahochi.

Stabilized by grasses and other vegetation, young dunes of about 1,000years old are found throughout the park.|$|E
5|$|Forest fires {{seasonally}} {{clear the}} park of dead vegetation, making way for new growth. These fires damage the income generated by tourism. The Summer of Fire saw more resources {{dedicated to the}} subject of wildfire than ever before or since in the United States. The Rim Fire in 2013 destroyed nearly $2 billion in assets and revenue, though natural woodland assets are renewable, and closed off much of <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>to</b> tourists. This rim fire was the third largest on record, and burned nearly 500 acres of wild habitat.|$|E

5|$|In {{a change}} of {{direction}} in March 1882, L'Estrange applied to the Sydney City Council to establish a juvenile pleasure gardens at the Paddington Reservoir.

L'Estrange proposed <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>to</b> be free entry with all monies being made via the sale of refreshments on site.

5|$|On July 27, 2012, {{following}} a thorough {{evaluation of the}} roller coaster, Kings Island announced that Son of Beast will be removed from <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>to</b> make room for future expansion. Demolition began in mid-September 2012. On November 20, {{one of the last}} remaining parts of the structure, the lift hill, was demolished. A new roller coaster called Banshee was completed in April 2014 and is now in the same location previously occupied by Son of Beast.|$|E
5|$|The Macdonalds {{sought to}} {{maintain}} the park's natural beauty, planting 10,000shrubs in the first year, and thousands of trees during the 1930s. In the first few years, the park added a circle swing, a Whip, a miniature railroad, and in 1938, the Philadelphia Toboggan Company Rollo Coaster. World War II and the resulting rationing forced <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>to</b> close in 1943. Upon reopening in 1946, the park added the Caterpillar and a small showboat that sailed in Lake Bouquet.|$|E

5|$|The city's {{fiscal crisis}} in the 1970s caused the rest of <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>to</b> fall into disrepair. A dearth of funds {{exacerbated}} the pollution of the park. Hands-on education programs at the park were reduced to passive observations of flora and fauna. Elsewhere in the park, excessive foot traffic was eroding the soil in the forests. The stock of younger, replacement trees in the old-growth forest had relatively little diversity compared to other natural forests.|$|E
5|$|The {{street is}} one of the key bus {{corridors}} in Central London. It is used by London bus routes 2, 10, 13, 16, 36, 73, 74, 137, 148, 414, 436 and night bus routes N16, N73, N74 and N137. The nearest tube stations are Hyde Park Corner on the Piccadilly line near the street's southern end and Marble Arch on the Central line near its northern end. At Brook Gate, partway along the road, there is a traffic signal controlled pedestrian and cycle crossing connecting Hyde Park to London Cycle Route 39 the recommended cycling route from <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>to</b> the West End.|$|E
5|$|To date, the {{excavation}} project at Fort Tanjong Katong has ended {{and only the}} south-eastern bastion, which was nearly fully excavated, has been cordoned off indefinitely (the south-western bastion was left untouched). Except for the cordoned off bastion, other exposed fort remains were reburied again in December 2005 by the National Parks Board, which runs <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> <b>to</b> protect them against the elements for future archaeologists to discover. It was also done because the dug-out pits could well breed mosquitoes; there were also fears that someone might {{fall into one of}} the 2 m-deep holes. The remaining funds, about S$150,000, were ploughed back into bursaries and scholarships for the constituency's students.|$|E
