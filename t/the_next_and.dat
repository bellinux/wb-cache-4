5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Hamilton extended his lead in the World Drivers' Championship to be seven points ahead of Button. This ensured the pair would enter <b>the</b> <b>next,</b> <b>and</b> their home race - the British Grand Prix - as first and second in the championship. Vettel's victory moved him up to third in standings; he became six points behind Button after surpassing the totals of teammate Mark Webber and Fernando Alonso. By gaining the most points from the race, McLaren extended their lead in the World Constructors' Championship to thirty over Red Bull.|$|E
5|$|By 1974, the {{majority}} of the freeway that US-64 was to occupy in Tulsa was complete, and it was relocated onto the completed portion of the freeway. Only the portion in the downtown section of the city was yet to be completed. The remainder of the freeway, the concurrency with Interstate 444, was not completed until about 1983. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>and</b> final major modification to the designation of US-64 took place when it was moved from its route through eastern Tulsa onto the newly constructed Creek Turnpike over the first half of 1992. The route has undergone only minor changes since then.|$|E
25|$|Highlights {{shows of}} Dick and Dom were shown <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day <b>and</b> on <b>the</b> {{following}} weekend. Further highlights compilations were broadcast <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day <b>and</b> over <b>the</b> following weekend.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> day my Lady Kicklebury {{walked over}} to the money-changers, where she changed a couple of {{circular}} notes. She was at the table that night again: <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> night, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> night, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next.</b>|$|R
30|$|When the kernel {{function}} of multiplication of blockA_s and blockB_s is called, channels a and b begin to preload <b>the</b> <b>next</b> blockA_snext <b>and</b> blockB_snext, respectively. After the kernel ends, the computing kernel of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> blockA_snext <b>and</b> blockB_snext is called successively. When multiplication of blockA and blockB ends, channels d and c begin to write blockC back <b>and</b> preload <b>the</b> <b>next</b> blockC_next, respectively. At the same time, the multiplication of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> blockA_next <b>and</b> blockB_next begins to execute.|$|R
5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea. Because they were sighted only from one location, their true distances could not be measured. These moonlets may be anywhere in size from gravel to stadium-sized. Their origins are unknown, but they may be gravitationally captured into current orbit or they may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>and</b> final orbit (just an hour before destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet. However, this time Amalthea {{was on the other side}} of the planet, so it is probable that the particles form a ring around the planet near Amalthea's orbit.|$|E
5|$|In early Fall 2014 VDOT {{will start}} work at Route 37's {{southern}} terminus' exit at I-81. They will extend Route 37 north {{to a new}} diamond interchange with Front Royal Pike (US 522). Then Route 37 will continue northward to Millwood Pike (US 50/ US 17) and have another diamond interchange. The next exit will be at Senseny Road (State Route 657) with another diamond interchange. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>and</b> final exit will be a half cloverleaf interchange with VA 7, {{but it is not}} final {{that it will be a}} half cloverleaf because of Valley Mill Road (State Route 659). The problem with this is that the intersection with Valley Mill Road is where the southbound exit for Route 37 is to come into Route 7.|$|E
5|$|Stanford first-year student Arantxa King {{was chosen}} by the Bermuda Olympic Association on Wednesday, July 23, 2008 {{through the use of}} its IAAF female at-large selection. Her {{participation}} in the 2008 Beijing Olympics marked her Olympic debut. During the August 18 Qualifying rounds, King was placed in Heat 2 versus competitors that included Russia's Tatiana Lebedeva and Nigeria's Blessing Okagbare, both of whom received medals in the event finals. King jumped a distance of 6.01meters, 0.69meters behind leading qualifier Lebedeva's score, placing nineteenth (out of twenty-one) in the event. She placed last in the heat, ahead of two disqualified athletes, and thirty-sixth (out of forty-two) athletes when considering all heats at once. Arantxa King did not progress to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>and</b> final round on August 22.|$|E
50|$|Earnhardt {{was saved}} from going a lap {{down when the}} first caution of the race flew with 57 laps to go after Allgaier's engine let go exiting turn 2. Ryan Newman opted not to pit and assumed the lead. He pitted <b>the</b> <b>next</b> lap <b>and</b> handed <b>the</b> lead to Kurt Busch. He pitted <b>the</b> <b>next</b> lap <b>and</b> gave <b>the</b> lead to David Gilliland. He pitted <b>the</b> <b>next</b> lap <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lead cycled to Matt Kenseth.|$|R
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 48. Green flag stops {{started on}} lap 83. Kenseth pitted from {{the lead on}} lap 87 {{and handed it to}} Joey Logano.

He pitted <b>the</b> <b>next</b> lap <b>and</b> handed <b>the</b> lead to Kyle Busch who pitted the same lap on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> trip by, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lead cycled back to Logano.|$|R
5|$|The Serjeants only enjoyed their {{returned}} {{status for}} another six years, however, before Parliament intervened. The Practitioners in Common Pleas Act 1846, from 18 August 1846, allowed all barristers {{to practice in}} the Court of Common Pleas. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>and</b> final blow was the Judicature Act 1873, which came into force on 1 November 1875. Section 8 provided that common law judges need no longer be appointed from the Serjeants-at-Law, removing the need to appoint judicial Serjeants. With this Act {{and the rise of}} the Queen's Counsel, there was no longer any need to appoint Serjeants, and the practice ended.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>and</b> last {{residents}} of the house were Gilbert and Esme Smyth. They lived there for the next thirty years. Gilbert died in a 1940 and Esme in 1946 {{and the house was}} left to their daughter Esme Francis Cavendish. She and her husband tried to sell the house immediately in 1946 to help pay the death duties. However the Cavendish family did not succeed until thirteen years later in 1959 during which time the house was unoccupied and started to decay. It was sold at this time to Bristol City Council who still owns it today.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{definition}} of Heinrich events is the climatic event causing the IRD layer observed in marine sediment cores from the North Atlantic: a massive collapse of northern hemisphere ice shelves {{and the consequent}} release of a prodigious volume of icebergs. By extension, the name Heinrich events can also refer to the associated climatic anomalies registered at other places around the globe, at approximately the same time periods. The events are rapid: they last probably less than a millennium, a duration varying from one event to <b>the</b> <b>next,</b> <b>and</b> their abrupt onset may occur in mere years (Maslin et al. 2001). Heinrich events are clearly observed in many North Atlantic marine sediment cores covering the last glacial period; the lower resolution of the sedimentary record before this point {{makes it more difficult}} to deduce whether they occurred during other glacial periods in the Earth's history. Some (Broecker 1994, Bond & Lotti 1995) identify the Younger Dryas event as a Heinrich event, which would make it event H0 (table, right).|$|E
50|$|The race {{restarted}} on lap 142. Truex ducked onto pit road on lap 177 {{and handed}} the lead to Busch. He pitted <b>the</b> <b>next</b> lap <b>and</b> handed <b>the</b> lead to Elliott. He pitted <b>the</b> <b>next</b> lap <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lead cycled back to Edwards.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, the Recruit Seagulls hired Stant to be Defensive coordinator.

25|$|The early {{stories were}} serialised in nature, with the {{narrative}} of one story flowing into <b>the</b> <b>next,</b> <b>and</b> each episode having its own title, although produced as distinct stories with their own production codes. Following The Gunfighters (1966), however, each serial was given its own title, and the individual parts were simply assigned episode numbers.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{is often}} cited that women were not {{admitted}} to the school until 1970, there was one women in the first class held, four in <b>the</b> <b>next,</b> <b>and</b> more in almost every class since then.

25|$|As {{with many}} other generic terms, there are many {{definitions}} of tradition.

25|$|Historically, each Gunatit Guru in {{the lineage}} has {{continued}} to reveal his successor; Gunatitanand Swami revealed Pragji Bhakta (Bhagatji Maharaj), who in turn revealed Shastriji Maharaj, who pointed to Yogiji Maharaj, who revealed Pramukh Swami Maharaj, the Guru, thus continuing the lineage of Akshar. Most recently, Pramukh Swami Maharaj revealed Mahant Swami Maharaj as <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>and</b> current Guru in the lineage.|$|E
25|$|A year later, in June 2003, {{demolition}} {{and reconstruction}} was the confirmed preference. Costs were projected {{for the next}} year's draft annual plan.
