50|$|Th grey-headed parakeet {{is often}} {{captured}} in the exotic bird trade and many are locally kept as pets.They tend to be popular in some small villages in southern China and surrounding areas. The constant <b>trapping</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> is greatly affecting the wild population. Deforestation and logging of the bird's natural forest habitat is also making {{a negative impact on}} the parakeet's population. The country of Laos and its uninhabited forest hills seems to act as a safe haven for the species.|$|E
50|$|The Nariva Swamp is {{protected}} by 3 main pieces of legislation: the Forests Act, Chapter 66: 01; the Conservation of Wildlife Act, Chapter 67: 01; the State Lands Act, Chapter 57: 01. Offences taken to court are usually related to wildlife poaching and tree felling. This was not entirely successful and encroachment by squatters was ongoing (Ramsar, 1996). The Nariva Swamp has been threatened in the past by illegal squatting; the conversion of land to cannabis and rice farming, illegal grazing of livestock in the game sanctuary, overfishing and illegal timber harvesting, illegal hunting and excessive <b>trapping</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> for the pet trade (Ramsar, 1996).|$|E

40|$|In this {{contribution}} a novel {{method of}} obtaining genetic material (DNA) from waterfowl nests using non-invasive approach is briefly described and discussed. Pilot project on Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) showed that the proposed methodological approach {{can be used to}} gather data on basic breeding population parameters, including the frequency of renesting, philopatry, or inter-annual dispersion of individuals. Compared with the more traditional approaches of population biology (e. g., direct <b>trapping</b> <b>of</b> <b>birds,</b> individual marking of individuals by rings etc.) the great advantage of the method proposed is its easy application in the field, leading to more effective sampling of entire populations of focal species at large spatial scales. Last but not least, the non-invasive sampling minimizes the disturbance of breeding individuals...|$|E
25|$|The {{decline of}} the species in the 1970s and early 80s is {{attributed}} to hunting and <b>trapping</b> <b>of</b> the <b>birds,</b> unsustainable harvesting <b>of</b> the Caraíba trees for firewood, {{the construction of the}} Sobradinho Dam above Juazeiro starting in 1974 that submerged the basin woodlands under an artificial lake, and the northward migration of the Africanized bee, which competes for nesting sites.|$|R

25|$|The {{popularity}} of parrots as pets {{has led to}} a thriving—and often illegal—trade in the birds, and some species are now threatened with extinction. A combination <b>of</b> <b>trapping</b> <b>of</b> wild <b>birds</b> and damage to parrot habitats makes survival difficult or even impossible for some species of parrot. Importation of wild-caught parrots into the US and Europe is illegal after the Wild Bird Population Act was passed in 1992.|$|R
50|$|The yellow-billed amazon, {{also called}} the Jamaican amazon, (Amazona collaria) is a species of parrot in the family Psittacidae. It is a {{predominantly}} green parrot with a short tail and pink throat and neck. It is endemic to Jamaica, where its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, subtropical or tropical mangrove forests, subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, plantations, and rural gardens. It is threatened by habitat loss and illegal <b>trapping</b> <b>of</b> wild <b>birds</b> for the pet trade.|$|R
50|$|Because {{they are}} highly sought after as pets, and because <b>trapping</b> <b>of</b> wild <b>birds,</b> which is now illegal, {{there has been a}} {{population}} decline. This has made them difficult to find. Panama amazons are extremely playful, can be excellent talkers, and tend to be loud at times; much like (nominate) yellow-crowned, double yellow-headed, and yellow-naped amazon parrots. Though their body-language is the same, Panama amazons are much less likely to become physically aggressive. Many other amazon parrots are erroneously sold as Panama amazons, because of their scarcity and popularity.|$|R
5000|$|Around 1992 {{an attempt}} was made by a breeder to {{establish}} a wild population of rainbow lorikeets around Auckland. [...] The species was considered a competitor to native species and a threat to horticulture. So in 1999 it was declared an 'unwanted organism' under the Biosecurity Act, and a plan to remove the estimated 200 feral birds was made. [...] Live <b>trapping</b> <b>of</b> the <b>birds</b> was carried out [...] The population appears under control, and there is an ongoing program to ensure they do not establish a self-sustaining wild population.|$|R

2500|$|The {{chaffinch}} {{was once}} popular as a caged song bird and large numbers <b>of</b> wild <b>birds</b> were <b>trapped</b> and sold. At {{the end of}} the 19th century trapping even depleted the number <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> in London parks. In 1882 the English publisher Samuel Orchart Beeton issued a guide on the care <b>of</b> caged <b>birds</b> and included the recommendation: [...] "To parents and guardians plagued with a morose and sulky boy, my advice is, buy him a chaffinch." [...] Competitions were held where bets were placed on which caged chaffinch would repeat its song the greatest number <b>of</b> times. The <b>birds</b> were sometimes blinded with a hot needle in the belief that this encouraged them to sing. This practice is the subject of the poem The Blinded Bird by the English author Thomas Hardy which contrasts the cruelty involved in blinding the birds with their zestful song. In Britain the practice of keeping chaffinches as pets declined after the <b>trapping</b> <b>of</b> wild <b>birds</b> was outlawed by the Wild <b>Birds</b> Protection Acts <b>of</b> 1880 to 1896.|$|R
5000|$|The red-crowned amazon, (Amazona viridigenalis) {{also known}} as red-crowned parrot, green-cheeked amazon, or Mexican {{red-headed}} parrot, is an endangered amazon parrot native to northeastern Mexico. The current native wild population of between 1,000 and 2,000 is decreasing. The main threats to the native bird's survival are the illegal export <b>of</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>birds</b> from Mexico to the United States {{and the destruction of}} habitat.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} lethal {{techniques}} {{have been described}} for the killing <b>of</b> <b>birds.</b> Dead-fall <b>traps,</b> consisting <b>of</b> heavy slabs or branches, that fall onto the targets when they trigger it from below have been described from early times. A painting <b>of</b> such a <b>trap</b> for killing crows was made by Pieter Bruegel the Elder in 1565. Birds are particularly vulnerable at their nest {{and a variety of}} methods to capture nesting birds exist around the world. In 2005, after a 100-year-long prohibition, the French government permitted the reintroduction of the use <b>of</b> stone <b>traps</b> ("tendelles") in the Départements Lozère and Aveyron. Around the Mediterranean birds are caught in France, Italy, Spain, Greece, Cyprus, Malta and other countries by traps specifically during the migratory seasons when birds travel between Europe and Africa and back. In many countries <b>trapping</b> <b>of</b> wild <b>birds</b> is illegal and thus represents poaching. Cyprus is a stepping stone in the eastern European-African flyway. Although illegal for decades bird trapping is a black market enterprise with a profitable sale <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> to restaurants that cater to their patrons serving ambelopoulia. The spring 2010 led to the killing of over a quarter million <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> in Cyprus. Some birds with weak flight can be captured by chasing them. In India waterfowl were once captured by hunters who walked underwater with an earthen pot over their head. By walking up to floating ducks they could grab the legs of the duck. Empty pots were floated for a few days to make the birds accustomed to them.|$|R
50|$|The {{hyacinth}} macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus), or hyacinthine macaw, is a parrot native to {{central and eastern}} South America. With a length (from {{the top of its}} head to the tip of its long pointed tail) of about 100 cm (3.3 ft) it is longer than any other species of parrot. It is the largest macaw and the largest flying parrot species, though the flightless kakapo of New Zealand can outweigh it at up to 3.5 kg. While generally easily recognized, it can be confused with the far rarer and smaller Lear's macaw. Habitat loss and the <b>trapping</b> <b>of</b> wild <b>birds</b> for the pet trade have taken a heavy toll on their population in the wild, so the species is classified as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List, and it is protected by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).|$|R
50|$|The yellow-billed amazon is {{classified}} as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). They are a protected species being listed on appendix II of CITES, which makes trade and export <b>of</b> <b>trapped</b> wild <b>birds</b> illegal. Its populations are fragmented {{and it has a}} small range. It is threatened by habitat loss, illegal trapping for the pet trade, and felling of trees with suitable nesting cavities. They are also threatened by potential hybridization with non-endemic pet amazon parrots, which occasionally escape particularly during the hurricane season.|$|R
50|$|In Europe, the 1979 Birds Directive and its {{amendments}} {{seeks to}} protect wild birds and allows hunting only within certain limits. According to the Directive use <b>of</b> <b>traps,</b> <b>bird</b> lime (glue), nets, live decoys and poison is forbidden {{at all times}} and birds are protected during breeding and spring migration. Malta joined the European Union in 2004 and obtained certain exemptions from the protective laws that apply to the membership states regarding wild <b>birds.</b> <b>Trapping</b> <b>of</b> several types of finches was allowed for five years until 2009 when the derogation was phased out. Malta had about 4,700 licensed trappers in 2007 who, by exemption from European protective laws, continue to trap quail, turtle doves, golden plovers and song thrushes. Further, illegal trapping {{continues to be a}} problem in Malta. In North America the Migratory <b>Bird</b> Treaty Act <b>of</b> 1918 and its amendments protect wild birds.|$|R
40|$|Trappers in New Zealand have {{traditionally}} used ground-set leg-hold traps to catch possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) but these sets also occasionally catch kiwi (Apteryx spp.) and weka (Gallirallus australis). To prevent the <b>trapping</b> <b>of</b> these <b>birds,</b> the Department <b>of</b> Conservation (DoC) requires all traps {{to be placed}} 70 cm above the ground in areas with kiwi and weka. To set leghold traps at this height, additional materials need to be carried, such as platforms or boards, and this reduces trapper efficiency. An alternative approach which {{has the potential to}} improve trapper efficiency and address welfare concerns due to leg-hold trapping is to use kill traps set on tree trunks 70 cm above the ground. Two trunk-set kill-trap types (BMI 160 and LDL 101) were tested for possum capture efficiency and compared with ground-set Victor No. l unpadded leg-hold traps. Possum capture efficiencies were similar for both trunk-set kill traps but were much less than for ground-set leg-hold traps. However, capture efficiency <b>of</b> kill <b>traps</b> on a per visit basis could be increased if traps were left for several nights before being checked (assuming the pendin...|$|R
40|$|The arid and {{semi-arid}} {{zones of}} Australia {{are characterized by}} highly variable and unpredictable environmental conditions which affect the provision of resources for flora and fauna. Environments which are highly unpredictable {{in terms of both}} resource access and distribution are likely to select for a variety of adaptive behavioral strategies, intrinsically linked to the physiological control of behavior. How unpredictable resource distribution has affected the coevolution of behavioral strategies and physiology has rarely been quantified, particularly not in Australian birds. We used a captive population of wild-derived zebra finches to test the relationships between behavioral strategies relating to food access and physiological responses to stress and body condition. We found that individuals which were in poorer body condition and had higher peak corticosterone levels entered baited feeders earlier in the <b>trapping</b> sequence <b>of</b> <b>birds</b> within the colony. We also found that individuals in poorer body condition fed in smaller social groups. Our data show that the foraging decisions which individuals make represent not only a trade-off between food access and risk of exposure, but their underlying physiological response to stress. Our data also suggest fundamental links between social networks and physiological parameters, which largely remain untested. These data demonstrate the fundamental importance of physiological mechanisms in controlling adaptive behavioral strategies and the dynamic interplay between physiological control of behavior and life-history evolution...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} the phenology and biometrics of Bluethroats staging in the Eilat region. This is {{of special interest}} because of the extreme conditions with which this temperate zone breeding species has to contend because Eilat is a desert habitat and is the last green area before the crossing of the deserts in autumn or after it in spring. Data were collected during 20 spring and 18 autumn migration seasons in the years 1984 – 2003, {{and a total of}} 7, 464 Bluethroat were recorded. The number <b>of</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>birds</b> was much higher in autumn than in spring. The majority of Bluethroats caught in both the autumn and spring migrations were juveniles. We found differences in sex ratio in the individual age classes only in the autumn wherein among both adults and juveniles, males were in greater numbers. We also found significant differences in the dates <b>of</b> ringed <b>birds</b> from different sex–age classes in the spring and in autumn migrations. In spring, males from both age classes were caught earlier than females. In autumn, adult birds arrived earlier than juveniles. We think {{that it is important to}} identify and conserve the high quality stopover habitats such as Eilat wherein not only Bluethroats have been shown to stopover but also several hundred other species...|$|R
40|$|The {{breeding}} diets of four diurnal raptor {{species were}} studied, by analysis of pellets, prey remains, stomach flushes <b>of</b> <b>trapped</b> <b>birds</b> and feeding observations, in the Top End of the Northern Territory {{and in the}} Kimberley region (northern Western Australia) in 1988 - 89. These were the Black-breasted Buzzard Hamirostra melanosternon, Brown Goshawk Accipiter fasciatus, Little Eagle Hieraaetus morphnoides and Australian Hobby Falco longipennis. The Buzzard and Brown Goshawk were vertebrate generalists (mammals, birds and reptiles), the former also taking birds&# 039; eggs, and the latter also taking many invertebrates. The Little Eagle took mostly birds, with few reptiles and even fewer mammals. The Hobby took small birds and flying insects. This study complements another, concurrent study of the raptor community in the Top End, by characterising the feeding niches of an additional four diurnal species out of the ten now studied in some detail. The remaining 14 species (of the 24 {{that make up the}} diurnal raptor assemblage in northern mainland Australia) require further attention in the tropics...|$|R
5000|$|In 1989, {{there was}} a big <b>trapping</b> <b>of</b> {{hundreds}} of foxes at Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge. The red foxes were killed because they put a significant threat to two endangered species <b>of</b> <b>birds,</b> light-footed clapper rail and the California least tern. Even though an animal rights group had requested an injunction to prohibit trapping and maiming the foxes at the refuge, U.S District Judge refused to grant it. Thus, hundreds of foxes were sacrificed to preserve the light-footed clapper rail and the California least tern. Nowadays, no foxes or other predatory mammals can be seen at Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge.|$|R
