5|$|Henry Ward Beecher became {{involved}} in many social issues of his day, most notably abolition. Though Beecher hated slavery as early as his seminary days, his views were generally more moderate than those of abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison, who advocated {{the breakup of the}} Union if it would also mean the end of slavery. A personal turning point for Beecher came in October 1848 when he learned of two escaped young female slaves who had been recaptured; their father had been offered the chance to ransom them from captivity, and appealed to Beecher to help raise funds. Beecher raised over two <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> secure the girls' freedom. On June 1, 1856, he held another mock slave auction to purchase the freedom of a young woman named Sarah.|$|E
5|$|When Saldívar {{became a}} {{business}} associate, their relationship began to deteriorate. In September 1994, Selena met Ricardo Martinez, {{a doctor who}} lived in Monterrey, Mexico. Selena wanted to expand the number of boutiques by opening a Selena Etc. store in Monterrey. Martinez said he had contacts in Mexico who could help her grow her business. Martinez became a business adviser to Selena, though her family said he was simply a fan who posed in several pictures with her. Saldívar became envious of Selena's dependency on Martinez. He began sending flowers to Selena's hotel room. Saldívar warned the singer that Martinez might have unprofessional intentions. Selena began visiting Monterrey more frequently, often in disguise. Sebastian D'Silva, Martinez's assistant, would pick up Selena at the airport; he said he noticed she was wearing wigs and using her husband Chris Pérez's surname so others would not identify her. According to Martinez, he had lent several <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> Selena because she was short on cash.|$|E

25|$|In 1954, with a {{stronger}} organization, Cramer ran again and unseated Campbell {{by the same}} 0.7 percent margin by which he had lost in 1952.

Gashade examines the dead horse and notes that {{it appeared to be}} perfectly healthy. The woman offers Gashade a <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> lead her to a place called Kingsley. Although openly distrustful of her, he grudgingly accepts the offer. Coley, apparently smitten by the woman, accompanies them.|$|E
25|$|Plans for {{erecting}} {{a memorial}} to Butt and Millet began shortly after {{the introduction of the}} Senate resolution. Taft agreed to chair the memorial committee. Taft's personal secretary, Charles D. Hilles, and his military aide, Colonel Spencer Cosby, led the fund-raising on behalf of the committee. Charles J. Bell of the American Security and Trust Company was the treasurer. Members of the foreign diplomatic corps and several high government officials had already donated several <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> the memorial fund by mid-May. Taft himself had made the first contribution. At this point in time, The Ellipse (the southern part of President's Park) was chosen for the site of the memorial. However, the memorial committee was thinking only of erecting a bronze tablet.|$|E
25|$|The greatest, {{according}} to Townsend, was the 1840 case involving {{the will of}} a man named James Rogers. In the will, Rogers expressed that he had already provided assets from his estate amounting to five <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> the children of his first marriage and that upon his death, his estate was to be divided among his second wife and her children. A team of Menefee, future governor James F. Robinson, and Madison C. Johnson represented the five children from the first marriage, who filed suit to set aside the will {{on the grounds that}} their father had suffered a stroke and was not of sound mind when constructing the will. They argued opposite Henry Clay and Robert C. Wickliffe. The case lasted six days, and the decision in the case went against Menefee and Robinson.|$|E

25|$|Following the film's success, the group, without Hardin, {{moved to}} Los Angeles. Upon arrival, they met {{a lawyer for}} the William Morris Agency who {{connected}} them with producer Scott Rudin. As a result, the duo acquired a lawyer, an agent, and a script deal. Despite initially believing themselves {{to be on the verge}} of success, the duo struggled for several years. Stone slept on dirty laundry for upwards of a year because he could not afford to purchase a mattress. They unsuccessfully pitched a children's program titled Time Warped to Fox Kids, which would have involved fictionalized stories of people in history. The trio created two separate pilots, spaced a year apart, and despite the approval of development executive Pam Brady, the network disbanded the Fox Kids division. While at Fox, executive Brian Graden cut Parker and Stone a personal check of a few <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> produce a video greeting card he could deliver to friends; the film would be a sequel to their earlier short Jesus vs. Frosty.|$|E
500|$|In 1865, Robert E. Bonner of the New York Ledger offered Beecher twenty-four <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> {{follow his}} sister's example and compose a novel; the {{subsequent}} novel, Norwood, or Village Life in New England, {{was published in}} 1868. Beecher stated his intent for Norwood was to present a heroine who is [...] "large of soul, a child of nature, and, although a Christian, yet in childlike sympathy with the truths of God in the natural world, instead of books." [...] McDougall describes the resulting novel as [...] "a New England romance of flowers and bosomy sighs ... 'new theology' that amounted to warmed-over Emerson". The novel was moderately well received by critics of the day.|$|E
500|$|He later {{returned}} to royal service, accompanying the Prince of Wales on his tour of Canada and the United States in 1919, and Australia in 1920. The American {{leg of the}} tour posed problems with people trying to capitalise on the Prince's appearance for publicity purposes; one prominent actress, Mildred Harris Chaplin, passed herself off as the niece of a local dignitary {{in order to be}} photographed, whilst another offered Brooks a bribe of a <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> arrange a picture. Brooks admitted that he [...] "nearly gave in", but backed out at the last minute for fear of offending the Prince. He was less successful in avoiding offence with another photograph, this time of the Prince in his bath during the voyage. After it was published, George V called it inappropriate and Brooks was reprimanded.|$|E

500|$|Catherine Jane Stork {{volunteered to}} be the {{follower}} who would actually murder Turner, and bought guns and silencers. Stork was known to fellow followers as Ma Shanti Bhadra, and {{was also one of}} the three [...] "Big Mammas" [...] in Rajneeshpuram. Sally-Anne Croft (known by followers as Ma Prem Savita), an accountant and the group's Chief Financial Officer, provided money for the purchase of weapons related to the plot. Phyllis Caldwell (Ma Deva Ritka) described in a federal affidavit how members of the murder conspiracy obtained handguns, referring to Catherine Jane Stork and Sally-Anne Croft: [...] "Shanti B went down to Jesus Grove, and Savita gave us several <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> use to buy guns." [...] Jesus Grove referred to a group of trailers where all the leaders of the Rajneesh commune resided, except for Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh.|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg's first {{professional}} {{job in the}} animation business was as a director on Rocko's Modern Life (19931996), Nickelodeon's first in-house cartoon production. He [...] "ended up finding work in the industry and got a job" [...] at the television network after he met the show's creator, Joe Murray, at the 1992 Ottawa International Animation Festival, where Wormholes and Murray's My Dog Zero were both in competition. Murray, who was looking for people to direct Rocko's Modern Life at the time, saw Hillenburg's film and offered him a directorial role on the television series. He [...] " [...] friends that [...] a hard time about [...] ... but doors opened when [...] stepped into the animation world," [...] so he accepted it. He [...] "was planning on being a starving artist": [...] " [...] several <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> make a film and [...] I may not make it backI had loans out.

In October 2010, during a visit to a Bay Area elementary school alongside former Giants pitcher Juan Marichal, Affeldt told the students, [...] "I try to make sure everybody, all the young people in the world, also have a chance to dream really big." [...] In 2009, Affeldt donated five <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> the Not For Sale campaign for opening a medical clinic in Thailand for former child slaves. He also became a prominent member of Not For Sale's Free2Play campaign, pledging a $100 donation for every strikeout and recruiting other professional athletes, including his teammate Matt Cain and the St. Louis Cardinals' Matt Holliday. In addition, Affeldt has lent his support as a spokesperson for Larkin Street Youth Services, a San Francisco non-profit that provides services to young people experiencing homelessness.|$|E

500|$|Through {{their work}} at The Warlock Shop, Buczynski and Slater came {{to meet and}} befriend Judith and Thomas Kneital (also known by their craft names of Theos and Phoenix), who had {{recently}} taken control of the Long Island coven of Gardnerians in New York after the former high priest and high priestess, Raymond Buckland and his wife Rosemary, had decided to divorce. In early 1973, the shop hit financial difficulty, and the Kneitals personally lent several <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> Slater and Buczynski {{in order to help}} them out, which Buczynski promptly paid back. Their business quickly recovered, and they employed a young man from New Orleans named Robert Carey to work in the shop; he was a close personal friend of Candy Darling, and used to visit The Factory, where he was known as [...] "Chanel 13". The increasing relationship between Slater and Buczynski and the Kneitals led to socialising between their two covens; despite their differing class backgrounds (the Gardnerian Commack coven being largely middle class and the Welsh Traditionalist Brooklyn Heights coven being largely working class and counter-cultural), they got on well. In February 1973, Buczynski requested initiation into the Gardnerican Craft from the Kneitals, but they refused, being cautious of what uses he would put the Gardnerian liturgy to.|$|E
500|$|Mr. Dooley {{would become}} {{known for his}} humor, which was present {{in many of the}} Bridgeport columns, but the Pullman pieces were not the only ones to be serious. One had the {{drunkard}} Grady's little girl come shivering to Dooley's door on a winter's night with a can to be filled with beer for her father. Dooley accompanies her home, and tries to beat some decency into the sodden Grady. Another, with Dooley's recollections of a long-ago Christmas in Roscommon, caused Dunne to be brought to tears by his own writing. In another, Dooley joins with Father Kelly, the parish priest, in getting relief for [...] "the man Carey down the street that nobody likes, him being a notorious infidel". Dooley and the priest gather provisions for the atheist, later getting him a job, and endure his speech against the Bible until Kelly cuts him off, [...] "What talk have ye? Go an' starve no more." [...] Although he applauded such acts of individual charity, Dunne through Dooley denigrated charitable organizations, wondering that [...] "a man can square himself with his conscience by giving one <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> a policeman and telling him to distribute it! Why don't they get the poor up in a cage in Lincoln Park and hand them food {{on the end of a}} window pole, if they're afraid they'll bite" ...|$|E
500|$|The Dumas's {{business}} and those like it were criticized {{by a number}} of people who sought to reform the red light district. Reverend William Biederwolf condemned Butte as [...] "the lowest sinkhole of vice in the west," [...] and that he saw [...] "enough legitimate vice in Butte to damn the souls of every young man and young woman in it." [...] Biederwolf held revival services for residents which attracted [...] "rounders, gamblers and habitués of the red light district". However, the local business benefited and even depended on the support of the sex workers at the Dumas and other establishments like it. The prostitutes would buy their dresses at local clothiers, frequent the city's dry cleaners and would patronize Chinese herbalists, looking for birth control potions and venereal disease remedies. To ensure that their operations were unhampered, the girls at the Dumas would pay the city's police and governance five dollar [...] "fines". Instead of the closing or relocating the red light district, the mayor and police of Butte ordered that the women wear longer skirts and high-necked blouses and that they [...] "refrain from any indecent exposures." [...] After these ordinances were put in place, the Butte Miner reported that [...] "nothing was seen in the district except long dresses and long faces. What the women say about the matter is not fit for publication." [...] By 1910 the people were petitioning Mayor Charles Nevin to shut down the district; with the district contributing two <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>to</b> the city's coffers every month, the efforts eventually died.|$|E
