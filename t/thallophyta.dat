40|$|Seaweeds are {{macroscopic}} marine algae {{attached to}} solid substratum, {{growing in the}} shallow waters of sea. They belong to the primitive group of <b>Thallophyta</b> and are classified into three major Classes viz. Chlorophyceae (green algae), Phaeophyceae (brown algae) and Rhodophyceae (red algae). Seaweeds are important marine resources exploited for their commercial value {{as the source of}} phycocolloids such as agar, agarose, algin and carrageenan (Table 1), besides their use as food, source of enzymes, dyes, drugs, growth promoters, etc. In India, seaweeds are harvested from the natural beds along the Tamil Nadu and Gujarat coasts since 1966. Seaweed resources in our coastal waters are inadequate to meet the growing demand for the supply of raw materials to the seaweed industries. There is thus the need to cultivate commercially important seaweeds to augment the supply of raw materials to the existing industries and for their sustenance. This article reviews the current status of seaweed resources in India, their farming and industrial utilization...|$|E
40|$|Citation: Blachly, Charles Dallas. The {{effects of}} {{sunlight}} on bacteria. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1902. Introduction: Bacteria are one celled microscopic plants which reproduce by fission and are propagated by sporulation. In the evolutionary classification of plants they hold the following positions. Plant Kindgom, Sub Kingdom – <b>Thallophyta,</b> Division II – Euthallophyta or true thallophytes, Sub Division 1 – Schyomycetes, fission fungi or bacteria. As the above classification indicates the bacteria {{are supposed to}} be degenerate forms of fission plants, probably springing from the algae. Most of them being parasitic or saprophytic they have lost their power of photosynthesis, it in this degenerate form being no longer of use to them. Others of the nitrifying group derive their energy in an unknown way from certain mineral salts. As these plants gradually formed the saprophytic habit they lost the need of light to assist in forming starch. Those that burrowed into the interior of the medium in which they were growing were more protected from the external world than those living upon the surface. The result is their descendants which of course also inherited the tendency to leave the surface were more successful in the struggle for existence than those living upon the surface or exterior...|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the receptaculite Tetragonis sulcata d'Eichwald, 1860 in Upper Ordovician erratics from the {{northern}} Netherlands. D'Eichwald's original description is reviewed, giving a wider conception of the morphological diversity of receptaculites. Tetragonis sulcata is placed in the family Tetragonaceae Rietschel, 1969 (nomen correctum), together with Lepidolites dickhauti Ulrich, 1879. The aim {{of this study was to}} reconstruct the living receptaculite organism by documenting homologies between Tetragonis sulcata and receptaculites described in the literature. Through analysis of a diverse set of morphological features which thus were obtained, an attempt could be made to determine the pattern of receptaculite morphogenesis. This study therefore concentrates on the functional morphology, growth, and calcification of meroms which are extensively reviewed, particularly with respect to receptaculite growth. The geometry of merom distribution as a result of polar growth of receptaculites has been studied. A description is given of a merom arrangement not yet considered before, the Tetragonis type, which is compared with the normal, Receptaculites, type. Controversial issues, such as the position of soft parts in receptaculites as well as their life orientation, are discussed with regard to their palaeobiological significance. This approach produced some arguments against an apex-down orientation, as proposed by Campbell et al. (1974). Based on these data, the systematic position of receptaculites is analysed. Consequently, it is inferred that they should be regarded as calcareous algae. Comparison with representatives of the chlorophyte order Dasycladales provides sufficient arguments to establish the separate order Receptaculitales within the <b>Thallophyta...</b>|$|E
40|$|The two chief {{types of}} plants {{occurring}} in the marine environment are the algae and sea grasses. 	 These are capable of synthesizing the complex organic substances from the simple inorganic compounds 	 present in sea water. Sea grasses are the seed producing plants which fall into the botanical division of 	 Spermatophyta, whereas marine algae are the primitive group of plants with no true roots, stems and 	 leaves as observed in higher plants and these come under the division <b>Thallophyta.</b> This division also 	 includes certain fungi and bacteria, the latter especially forming an important group in the organic productivity 	 of the sea. Among the algae in the marine habitats, the microscopic and free floating or swimming forms are 	 known as Phytoplankton. The other macroscopic or attached ones, which often grow in the intertidal and 	 subtidal environments, are {{commonly referred to as}} Seaweeds. 	 Most of these marine algae or seaweeds are beautifully coloured and attached to rocks or grow on 	 other plants as epiphytes. A few of them are buried inside the sand and sometimes occur as loose lying 	 communities. Depending upon the type of pigment present in them and other morphological and anatomical 	 characters, macroscopic algae are subdivided into the following four classes: 	 1. Green Algae (Chlorophyceae) 	 2. Brown Algae (Phaeophyceae) 	 3. Red Algae (Rhodophyceae) 	 4. Blue-green Algae (Myxophyceae) 	 Algae belonging to the first three classes are treated here in detail since they constitute the vast majority of 	 seaweeds of economic importance. Among the blue-green algae, some freshwater species of Nostoc are 	 used as food gelly and many others are capable of fixing nitrogen and maintaining the fertility of the soil.

40|$|The growing {{interest}} in environmental issues {{and the establishment of}} new protected areas on land and seaside correspond to the worldwide need to understand and preserve the natural development of the ecosystems. The establishment of protected areas is fairly new for the marine habitat. It is becoming increasingly clear that marine protected areas represent an effective biodiversity conservation tool. Nowadays, there is a widespread growing need to recognize ecosystem interactions and to improve the effectiveness of protected areas in order to understand biological interrelations and human impacts. It was the lack of high quality and rigorous monitoring data concerning the marine protected areas (and not the lack of effects, which are almost certain) to bring us to perform the environmental monitoring described in this thesis. In order to understand the biological interactions of a marine protected area in the Mediterranean sea, a study was carried out inside and around the Marine Protected Area of Capo Carbonara located off the southern Sardinia Island. Samplings were performed to identify and quantify the benthonic fish stock and the composition of benthos in rocky shores at different depths and in different times of sampling. The composition of fish assemblages was evaluated both by the non-destructive visual census with SCUBA technique and the destructive method of the trammel net fishing. Fish assemblages in shallow rocky habitats (4 – 8 m deep) have been assessed between September 2004 and July 2005. Overall the list of target species included 24 species from 8 families (Labridae, Moronidae, Mullidae, Sciaenidae, Scorpaenidae, Serranidae, Sparidae, Sphiraenidae). The fish assemblages observed inside the protected area and outside, in the unprotected fished area were statistically different during all the sampling periods. Larger amount of fish was found in the protected than in the fished area, and differences were observed in total fish density, abundance, biomass: most fish species targeted by fisheries had a greater density (e. g. Diplodus puntazzo, Diplodus sargus, Diplodus vulgaris, Epinephelus marginatus, Mullus surmuletus, Pagrus pagrus, Sciena umbra, Scorpaena porcus, Serranus scriba, Sphyraena Sphyraena and Synphodus tinca) and/or size (e. g. Dentex dentex, Diplodus puntazzo, Diplodus sargus) within the protected area than in the fished areas outside. In the internal protected areas the Shannon Weaver diversity index showed richer ichtiofauna than outside, near the boundaries. Cluster analysis and MDS plot showed a general progressive increased similarity between protected and unprotected sites from the early census to the end, validating the spillover effects from inside to outside areas. These results indicate that reserve effects (protection) from fishing may have the potential to influence fish assemblages of outside areas. The composition of benthos in hard substrate, was examined applying benthic biocoenosis census through photographic and SCUBA techniques. Three years of sampling displayed the usefulness of the used techniques in a low budget study. The Visual census outcomes for macro benthic biocoenosis assemblages (5 - 25 m deep), assessed from September 2004 to May 2006, revealed 325 species (4 Phyla of <b>Thallophyta,</b> 1 of Anthophyta and 10 Phyla of Invertebrata) in all the analyzed sites. The analysis of the community structure revealed high biodiversity. In each sampling an ecological index classification as “Moderate” was recorded, both in the whole sanctuary and nearby the boundaries. In particular, some sites within the sanctuary showed a “Good” quality in different times and at different depths. Moreover, ecological and environmental factors able to modify the benthic composition often risked to warp outputs e. g. the presence of an alien species, the Caulerpa racemosa. In particular the analysis of these green algae within the sites was necessary because of its influence on the environment and consequently on the statistical analysis outputs. It is relevant that the recorded temporal scale of events can be useful for further analysis in the studied area and/or in other Marine Protected Areas. The application of this protocol seems to be a functional tool to manage marine environments almost until a co-ordinated network between the Mediterranean Marine Protected Areas will be created...|$|E
