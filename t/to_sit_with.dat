5|$|Bill Fulcher supplanted Bud Carson. Fulcher {{appeared}} to be the right choice but quit after two seasons, overwhelmed by the Tech fan base. Fulcher's tenure included a terrible feud with Eddie McAshan, which peaked before the 1972 UGA game. McAshan had requested additional tickets for the game so that his family could attend. Fulcher refused the ticket request and McAshan sat out of practice in protest. Fulcher responded by suspending the quarterback for the UGA game and the upcoming Liberty Bowl. The story exploded on the national scene when Jesse Jackson attended the UGA game, allowing McAshan <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> him outside of the stadium in protest.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{had known}} that ruling against the {{government}} might harm his prospects of promotion. By {{the time of the}} case, he was already the most senior judge of his district. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit often summoned him <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> that court to hear appeals, a task he found stimulating. In 1917, he lobbied for promotion to the Second Circuit, but the unpopularity of his Masses decision and his reputation as a liberal stood against him. He was passed over in favor of Martin T. Manton.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ava {{is asked}} to be the grand marshal to a New Year's Day parade. This makes her boyfriend, Kevin, feel like he can't live up to her lifestyle. He then starts {{thinking}} she may be ashamed of him, especially after he isn't invited <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> her during the parade. Eventually, Kevin confronts Ava on this and she reveals that if she messes up their relationship she doesn't wanted {{to be reminded of}} it while Googling her name. He assures her that their relationship won't end badly and the two go to the parade.|$|E

5|$|Crawford and Knight {{were taken}} to Wingenund's camp on June 7, where they found nine other prisoners. On June 11, Captain Pipe painted {{the faces of the}} prisoners black, the {{traditional}} sign they were to be executed. The prisoners were marched to the Delaware town on Tymochtee Creek, near the present-day village of Crawford, Ohio. Four prisoners were killed with tomahawks and scalped along the way. When the war party stopped, the seven remaining prisoners were made <b>to</b> <b>sit,</b> <b>with</b> Crawford and Knight a short distance away from the others. Delaware women and boys killed the other five with tomahawks, beheading one of them. The boys scalped the victims and slapped the bloody scalps in the faces of Crawford and Knight.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{arriving}} in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination {{because of his}} skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour. He was not allowed <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> European passengers in the stagecoach and told {{to sit on the}} floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to living}} in Seneca Falls, Stanton had become an admirer and friend of Lucretia Mott, the Quaker minister, feminist, and {{abolitionist}} whom she had met at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, England {{in the spring of}} 1840 while on her honeymoon. The two women became allies when the male delegates attending the convention voted that women should be denied participation in the proceedings, even if they, like Mott, had been nominated to serve as official delegates of their respective abolitionist societies. After considerable debate, the women were required to sit in a roped-off section hidden from the view of the men in attendance. They were soon joined by the prominent abolitionist, William Lloyd Garrison, who arrived after the vote had been taken and, in protest of the outcome, refused his seat, electing instead <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> the women.|$|E

Arthur offered <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> up <b>with</b> him, and he said, shortly, with his face turned away, 'No.' I insisted on having somebody left to watch him. He gave way when he found I was determined, {{and said he would}} accept the services of the waiter at the Inn.|$|R
5|$|Stephen was a well {{established}} figure in Anglo-Norman society by 1135. He was extremely wealthy, well-mannered and liked by his peers; {{he was also}} considered a man capable of firm action. Chroniclers recorded that despite his wealth and power he was a modest and easy-going leader, happy <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> his men and servants, casually laughing and eating with them. He was very pious, {{both in terms of}} his observance of religious rituals and his personal generosity to the church. Stephen also had a personal Augustinian confessor appointed to him by the Archbishop of Canterbury, who implemented a penitential regime for him, and Stephen encouraged the new order of Cistercians to form abbeys on his estates, winning him additional allies within the church.|$|E
5|$|Lewis and Audrey go {{on holiday}} to Greece {{together}} and Lewis suggests they move there and open a hotel. Audrey agrees {{and gets a}} £100,000 loan towards {{the purchase of the}} hotel. Lewis, needing money of his own, decides to steal from Peter Barlow's betting shop with fraudulently franked betting slips. He begins flirting with Deirdre Barlow, an employee at the betting shop. Lewis sends Deirdre out of the shop to get a corkscrew so they can share a bottle of wine. He places his fraudulent betting slips in the till and when Deirdre returns, he kisses her to distract her. Lewis slips out of Audrey's farewell party to collect his money and he leaves for the airport. Peter discovers Lewis has stolen from him and Audrey is devastated by his disappearance. She discovers Lewis has left her money alone and she finds a photograph of them with the words 'I tried' written on the back. While he is in the airport bar waiting for his flight to Barbados, Lewis introduces himself to Lydia Radcliffe and offers <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> her during the flight.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, the BBC invited Chesterton to give {{a series}} of radio talks. He accepted, {{tentatively}} at first. However, from 1932 until his death, Chesterton delivered over 40 talks per year. He was allowed (and encouraged) to improvise on the scripts. This allowed his talks to maintain an intimate character, as did the decision to allow his wife and secretary <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> him during his broadcasts.|$|E
25|$|In general, all {{proceedings}} in the Court {{are heard}} and disposed of before a single judge. Whenever {{the business of}} the Court requires, a Judge of Appeal of the Court of Appeal may sit in the High Court and act as a High Court Judge. If the Court feels that it requires assistance in a particular case, it may summon persons of skill and experience in the matter to which the proceedings relate <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> the Court and act as assessors.|$|E
25|$|Gwynplaine is instated as Lord Fermain Clancharlie, Marquis of Corleone, and {{permitted}} <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> the House of Lords. When {{he addresses}} the peerage with a fiery speech against the gross inequality of the age, the other lords are provoked to laughter by Gwynplaine's clownish grin. David defends him and challenges a dozen Lords to duels, {{but he also}} challenges Gwynplaine; the new Marquis' speech inadvertently condemned David's mother, who abandoned David's father to become the mistress of Charles II.|$|E

25|$|Like her family, Bankhead was a Democrat, but {{broke with}} many Southerners by campaigning for Harry Truman's reelection in 1948. She is {{credited}} with having helped Truman immeasurably by belittling his rival, New York's Governor Thomas E. Dewey. After Truman was elected, Bankhead was invited <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> the President during his inauguration. While viewing the inauguration parade, she booed the South Carolina float which carried then-Governor and segregationist Strom Thurmond, who had recently run against Truman on the Dixiecrat ticket, splitting the Democratic vote.|$|E
25|$|If Philip II of Macedon had {{not been}} the father of Alexander the Great, he would be more widely known as a first-rate {{military}} innovator, tactician and strategist, and as a consummate politician. The conquests of Alexander {{would have been impossible}} without the army his father created. Considered semi-barbarous by some metropolitan Greeks, the Macedonians were a martial people; they drank deeply of unwatered wine (the very mark of a barbarian) and no youth was considered to be fit <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> the men at table until he had killed, on foot with a spear, a wild boar.|$|E
25|$|Irish Setters {{are also}} widely used as therapy dogs {{in schools and}} hospitals. Therapy dogs are {{permitted}} in hospitals with special permission and can visit patients on the assigned floors. This is a venue where the therapy dogs are permitted in schools and then asked <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> children as the students read to the Irish Setter. This process helps to enable the student {{the ability to read}} without being corrected or judged. Generally the Irish Setter will lie on the floor with the student as the student continues to read, in this calming and relaxed setting.|$|E

25|$|In September 1647 Mackworth {{added the}} {{recorder}}ship of Wenlock {{to that of}} Shrewsbury and, at some stage, he also became recorder of Bridgnorth, although this is not attested before December 1653, when {{he was ordered to}} consider a petition concerning compensation for the burning of the town more than seven years earlier. In March 1648 he was appointed Attorney General for North Wales, alongside his Gray's Inn colleague Thomas Fell. In June Mackworth was granted a commission of oyer and terminer <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> Peter Warburton and Robert Duckenfield to try conspirators arrested by William Brereton in connection with a royalist plot to seize Chester Castle.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Christabel {{gives birth}} to a baby boy. Her father is so angry that he swears to have her killed, so he puts her into a small boat with her new-born baby and they are set adrift without food or water, {{at the mercy of}} the winds and the currents, to share a fate that is {{suffered}} also by Emaré and by Geoffrey Chaucer’s heroine Constance in his Canterbury tale from the Man of Law. Soon they are driven onto a rock, and mother and baby go ashore <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> the seagulls. A griffin appears from out of nowhere and carries the baby off.|$|E
25|$|Damien Hardwick {{selected}} a young {{team at the}} start of the season, with four debutants, and only three players (Ben Cousins, Chris Newman and Troy Simmonds) over 25 in the Round 1 loss against Carlton. Richmond was winless after nine games, before a scrappy win over Port Adelaide in Round 10. This was the start of a turnaround in Richmond's form, with the team winning six out of eight games, <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>with</b> a record of 6–12 after eighteen rounds. After losing the final four matches, Richmond finished fifteenth out of sixteen with a record of 6–16. Young key forward Jack Riewoldt finished the season with 78 goals, to win the Coleman Medal.|$|E
