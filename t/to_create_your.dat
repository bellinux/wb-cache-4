2500|$|Playing as {{a general}} manager {{is similar to the}} {{previous}} General Manager modes in the series, in which one has to choose a brand and act as its General Manager (Jonathan Coachman for Raw, Theodore Long for SmackDown!, Tommy Dreamer for ECW), draft a roster and make decisions to make it the most popular brand of the three. The General Manager is allowed to make staffing decisions, schedule workouts and events. This was also the last game in the Smackdown vs Raw series to have a General Manager mode. There is also an all-new Tournament Mode, which allows the player to control [...] a superstar through the various stages of the WWE tournament, such as Beat The Clock Sprint [...] and King of the Ring, as well as Money in the Bank tournament. The game also allows you <b>to</b> <b>create</b> <b>your</b> own tournament. (This feature is excluded from the Nintendo DS version.) Like previous games in the series, the game also allows players to challenge for and defend championships. The game includes championships used by the WWE in 2007, bringing back the branded championships from the previous game and for the first time, the ECW Championship.|$|E

5000|$|After Lupton {{graduated}} from college in 1985, her drive for changing the commercial art world took a change for the best. Lupton graduated {{with a degree in}} typography and later sought to follow within the field of design. “Graphic design was a revelation to me,” says Lupton. “Design really wasn't in the mainstream back then. It was esoteric. It was the thing you did if you were very 'neat,' which I wasn't.”. With the booming interest in self-help books, Lupton co wrote the book titled D.I.Y.: Design It Yourself with graduate students from MICA. This book showed ordinary people, a new way of designing their own, unique works. From designing blog pages <b>to</b> <b>creating</b> <b>your</b> own book cover, Lupton breaks down the simplicity of the design world.
