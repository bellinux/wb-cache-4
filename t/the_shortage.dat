5|$|The film's story {{takes place}} in Death Valley, where the large scale action {{sequences}} take place amid post-apocalyptic landscapes of Las Vegas in broad daylight. Drawing inspirations from western films and post-apocalyptic movies, including the Mad Max series, Extinction manages to reference such predecessors, with plot elements revolving around <b>the</b> <b>shortage</b> of oil, <b>the</b> <b>shortage</b> of supplies, a convoy traveling across a desert, and the desert taking over civilized land.|$|E

The author suggests a method of calculating maximum and minimum scale of a shadow market in contemporary world economy...|$|R

40|$|In this article, the {{theories}} about motif and type {{will be used}} for analyzing the very types of characters that suffered because of <b>the</b> <b>shortages.</b> To begin with, the analyzing of the differences and similarities of <b>the</b> <b>shortages</b> of each character will be counted on the inside and outside parts of their sufferings. Then {{the theories}} of Nietzsche’s and of some myths {{will be used for}} analyzing the further reason of the sufferings.

5|$|Enlisted sailors {{during this}} time {{included}} many foreign-born men, and native-born Americans were usually social outcasts who had few other employment options or {{they were trying to}} escape punishment for crimes. In 1835, almost 3,000men sailed with merchant ships out of Boston harbor, but only 90men were recruited by the Navy. It was unlawful for black men to serve in the Navy, but <b>the</b> <b>shortage</b> of men was so acute this law was frequently ignored.|$|E
5|$|In addition, <b>the</b> <b>shortage</b> of {{available}} manpower {{led to a}} greater burden being placed upon its allies (socii) {{for the provision of}} allied troops. Where accepted allies could not provide the required force types, the Romans were not averse during this period to hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.|$|E
5000|$|Shortages {{occur in}} {{regulated}} products, such as milk, {{various types of}} meat, chicken, coffee, rice, oil, precooked flour, butter prices, luxuries such as breast implants, and goods including basic necessities like toilet paper, personal hygiene products, and even medicine. As a result of <b>the</b> <b>shortages,</b> Venezuelans must search for food, wait in lines for hours and sometimes settle without having certain products. Maduro's government has blamed <b>the</b> <b>shortages</b> on [...] "bourgeois criminals" [...] hoarding goods.|$|R

5|$|The {{distinction}} between the heavy infantry types began to blur, perhaps because the state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment.

5|$|The first Corps was a {{small unit}} that served in the Caribbean from 1808 to 12 October 1810, {{recruited}} from former slaves to address <b>the</b> <b>shortage</b> of military manpower in the Caribbean. The locally-recruited men were less susceptible to tropical illnesses than were troops sent from Britain. The Corps followed {{the practice of the}} British Army's West India Regiments in recruiting slaves as soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The {{reintegration}} of French prisoners into {{civilian life}} was facilitated by {{a network of}} Maisons du Prisonnier (Prisoner Houses), established across France, which would help them readjust and find work. Generally, prisoners generally found it easy to regain their pre-war jobs because of <b>the</b> <b>shortage</b> of labour. The government had hoped that returning prisoners of war would be more sympathetic to the Vichy regime, but prisoners coming back were not noticeably more loyal to Vichy than other groups.|$|E

30|$|When ABO/Rh(D)-compatible blood {{substitution}} is not allowed, <b>the</b> total <b>shortage</b> {{of blood}} products within each blood {{group at the}} four blood banks reaches 1665 units. As the maximum ABO/Rh(D)-compatible substitution rate δ increases, <b>the</b> total <b>shortage</b> decreases while <b>the</b> total substitution amount increases. When δ> 10 %, both the total substitution amount and <b>the</b> total <b>shortage</b> remain constant due to the maximum possibility of ABO/Rh(D)-compatible blood substitution.|$|R
5000|$|According to Kornai, {{shortage}} economies share several common characteristics. They all experience frequent, {{intensive and}} chronic shortages. These are general in nature; that is, they occur in all spheres {{of the economy}} (consumer goods and services, means of production and producer goods). <b>The</b> <b>shortages</b> are both horizontal and vertical {{which means that they}} affect both the supply of intermediate goods as well as related complementary goods. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>shortages</b> are occasionally replaced by situations of surplus [...] "slack" [...] when too much of a particular good is supplied (often due to the mis-timing of production orders which arrive too late).|$|R
5|$|Xenotransplantation {{research}} involves transplanting tissues or organs {{from one}} species to another, {{as a way}} to overcome <b>the</b> <b>shortage</b> of human organs for use in organ transplants. Current research involves using primates as the recipients of organs from pigs that have been genetically modified to reduce the primates' immune response against the pig tissue. Although transplant rejection remains a problem, recent clinical trials that involved implanting pig insulin-secreting cells into diabetics did reduce these people's need for insulin.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} his first overseas tour, {{he returned to}} the United States in February 1943 and was assigned to the First Battalion, 23rd Marines, 4th Marine Division at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. When his unit moved to California he again asked for relief as a field musician; and for permission to perform line duties. Again, due to <b>the</b> <b>shortage</b> of buglers in the Marine Corps, his request was denied. Throughout the course of World War II, until his death on Iwo Jima, Cole participated in several battles and campaigns as a machine-gunner and was promoted to the rank of sergeant in 1944.|$|E

Two of her superiors had discussed not taking her to Iraq; it was felt she was a risk to herself and possibly others, according to a statement later issued by the Army—but <b>the</b> <b>shortage</b> of intelligence analysts dictated their decision to take her. In November 2009, she was promoted from Private First Class to Specialist.|$|E

5|$|As {{illustrated}} by the table of matches above, little is known of organised cricket to 1725 {{because of the lack}} of newspaper coverage. <b>The</b> <b>shortage</b> of references in the latter part of the 17th century is due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry. Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries. It follows that equally little is known of clubs and teams, players and locations.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, the United States National Helium Reserve {{accounted}} for 30 {{percent of the}} world's helium. The reserve was expected {{to run out of}} helium in 2018. Despite that, a proposed bill in the United States Senate would allow the reserve to continue to sell the gas. Other large reserves were in the Hugoton in Kansas, United States, and nearby gas fields of Kansas and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma. New helium plants were scheduled to open in 2012 in Qatar, Russia, and the US state of Wyoming, but they were not expected to ease <b>the</b> <b>shortage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing is {{a concept}} from market {{economics}} {{regarding the use of}} pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public goods for the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale is that, at a price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a shortage, and that <b>the</b> <b>shortage</b> should be corrected by charging the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply {{in the case of a}} tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.|$|E
