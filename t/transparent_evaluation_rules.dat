The {{issue of the}} energy savings evaluation is crucial for its implementation. The French White Certificates (FWC) scheme {{is one of the}} important measures for France to fulfill its ESD target. However, the accountings of energy savings in the FWC scheme and in the ESD are different. Therefore, an analysis of the consistency of the two systems is needed. A concrete example of actions on residential buildings is used to illustrate the challenges for policy marker and stakeholders to set harmonized <b>evaluation</b> <b>rules.</b> The FWC and ESD calculations appear to be consistent from a physics point of view, as long as calculations are well-documented. But due to differences in the policy objectives, calculation routines may be necessary to convert national energy savings unit (e. g., kWh cumac) into supranational energy savings unit (e. g., ESD kWh). Finally, the work done to establish a <b>transparent</b> <b>evaluation</b> system brings additional benefits (e. g., increased visibility and quality of the actions), which will improve the results of the energy efficiency policies on long term...|$|R

There was no evidence, when these variables were held constant, that scorers differed on the proportion of correct, incorrect, or no opinion decisions rendered. Results suggest no differences in chart scoring ability among scorers based at the two institutions. Observed differences in accuracies for Utah and DoDPI scoring systems {{may be due to}} differences in veracity decision rules, the number of charts evaluated, the inclusion of the photo-plethysmograph data channel, or a combination of these factors.
