After France, Switzerland—and I'm cutting out many East European countries where we were for only a few months each—then Poland in Kraków...

So we just had to dig in and put everything to the side and really work on something ... we had no idea that it would turn out as good as it did. It was a great experience It took me about a good two weeks to put all of the ideas that we had together. The good thing about the video is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> in knowing we were gonna shoot the video onstage a few times. I was actually able to get my camera crew onstage" ...|$|E
500|$|Outfielder Johnny Damon said of Boone's home run: [...] "If we do {{advance to}} the World Series and win, it's a better story <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> through New York. We needed to get back here. This is {{where a lot of}} hearts were broken, and we're in a perfect seat to stop the hurting." [...] Damon told USA Today: [...] "If we are going to win the World Series, it's better to beat the Yankees to get there. Otherwise, {{everybody}} will say, 'Well, you didn't have to face the Yankees.' I think we have the best team, so I hope the best team wins. But the Yankees are no slouches. We know that [...] Sheffield can hit every single pitch thrown to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|She told {{press in}} London that her latest album will reflect her {{emotional}} state and chronicle events in {{her personal life}} since her last musical release in 2002. She said [...] "That makes it real. The changes <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> through, the transitions <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> through, the tests <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> through, being a mother, becoming a single mother. It all had its ups and its downs, {{but for the most}} part, I kept my faith and I kept my head up... I took my time. All the triumphs and the ups and downs and stuff, it's all incorporated on the album, and hopefully not only does it inspire me, but inspires a whole lot of other people." ...|$|R

500|$|The album's cover {{art is a}} {{modified}} Hubble Space Telescope photo of the planetary nebula MyCn 18, popularly known as the Hourglass Nebula. Hubble Space Telescope photos of the Helix Nebula and Eagle Nebula are also featured in the inside cover and liner notes for this album, respectively. The photos were used {{with the permission of}} NASA. Regarding the artwork, Ament said, [...] "The reason <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> with Tchad [...] is because he provides an amazing atmosphere to songs....So, I think we wanted the artwork to represent that....One of the themes that we've been exploring...is just realizing that in the big scheme of things, even the music that we make when we come together, no matter how powerful it is, it's still pretty minuscule. I think for me the whole space theme {{has a lot to do}} with scale. You know, you look at some of those pictures, and there are thirteen light years in four inches in that picture." ...|$|E
500|$|Starbucks founder Howard Schultz {{reached out}} to Turlington to support her {{foundation}} Every Mother Counts, which seeks to make pregnancy and childbirth safe for mothers. David Legry, who served as Starbucks' editorial manager, helped shape the compilation after reading about Turlington's humanitarian work, and later worked with artists to select suitable songs. Turlington then recruited several artists, including: Carla Bruni, Sheryl Crow, Jennifer Lopez, Madonna, her friend Gwyneth Paltrow, and Martha Wainwright, {{to contribute to the}} project. She contacted all participating artists, and recalled: We already had our soundtrack, and I already had Martha Wainwright singing [...] "No Woman, No Cry," [...] which was great, but it got us all thinking that a compilation CD would be a great way to target women who are artists and also mothers and see what they're willing to contribute. So I wrote some letters and spoke to a few of the women that are on the CD, and threw the idea out and pretty much everybody <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> to is on this list and said yes and was really excited.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} in August 2005, Key explained that the album was a [...] "definite departure" [...] and [...] "more political" [...] than what Ocean Avenue had contained. In discussion of the album, Key said that the band had matured and that the music in Lights and Sounds would be different from their previous album. Though, Key added, [...] "...we have to be careful, {{we have to try}} and write songs [...] we wrote before. We have to make a conscious effort {{not to think about the}} fact <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> from being a nothing band... to having a bunch of hit singles in like, one year." [...] Printz Board of The Black Eyed Peas collaborated with Yellowcard on the song [...] "Two Weeks from Twenty" [...] where he played a trumpet solo. The song, [...] "How I Go", features a duet with Dixie Chicks' lead vocalist Natalie Maines, and features a twenty-five piece orchestra, which was conducted by violinist Sean Mackin. According to Peter Mosely, the band liked the Dixie Chicks' and even thought of collaborating with Maines on Ocean Avenue for the song [...] "View from Heaven". Mosely also revealed that the band approached Maines about singing on [...] "How I Go"; [...] "The original plan was just for her to sing back-up (on the song). [...] it ended up turning into a duet." [...] He also added that Maines took a demo of the song and returned to the studio, Sunset Sound, where the band were working, in addition to the Dixie Chicks working on their album, with lyrics and vocals of her own.|$|E

5000|$|The album {{would also}} be a very {{personal}} one for each of the members. Drummer Redd Claudio says, [...] "You’ll find that each track is based on a separate experience, it’s just narrating those experiences. That for me, shows how personal it is in that sense." [...] "album is about our lives, heartbreak, the things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> celebrate, the things <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> through, happiness. Anything <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> through in our lives, that's what Traces is all about, and all the memories," [...] said Jermaine.|$|R

2500|$|In 1894, Virginian {{and former}} Confederate soldier John S. Mosby, {{reflecting}} {{back on his}} role in the war, stated in a letter to a friend that [...] "I've always understood <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> to war on account of the thing we quarreled with the North about.

2500|$|He {{attended}} {{only one}} reunion of his Rangers, in Alexandria, Virginia, in January 1895, noticing with bemusement how many had become clergymen but preferring {{to look forward}} not back. During the war, he had kept a slave, Aaron Burton, to whom he occasionally sent money in Brooklyn, New York {{after the war and}} with whom he kept in contact into the 1890s. In 1894, Mosby wrote to a former comrade regarding the cause of the war, stating: [...] "I've always understood <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> to war on account of the thing we quarreled with the North about.

2500|$|The band {{subsequently}} started afresh {{in early}} 2012, returning to Droste's mother's home in Cape Cod, where the band had previously recorded its second studio album, Yellow House (2006). Commenting {{on the return}} to Yellow House, Droste noted, [...] "It's so funny <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> back there in the end. It's my grandmother's house, we know it, and we can use it for free. And {{as soon as we}} got there, things started happening. [...] We just sat by the fire, Dan strumming, me singing, and it happened. Some of the best songs on the record, like [...] "Speak in Rounds" [...] and [...] "Half Gate", came out of that. We stayed there in isolation for two months straight." [...] Droste stated that he and Rossen decided to [...] "'try writing from the bottom up. We've never done it before.' There's a little bit of fear there because it's a new process we've never tried. We've never sat side by side and said, 'Let's literally, out of the ether, start writing songs together.' A couple of songs came that way, and that's why they're verse me, chorus Dan. [...] Suddenly the synergy hit, and the momentum struck, and then everyone got excited. And that's when the ball started to roll, and then we just started playing around, and people were much more open."" ...|$|E
2500|$|... “It {{was night}} of the 17th to 18thJuly, 1918. When we were sure the whole town was asleep, we quietly stole through the window into the school building. Nobody there noticed our presence, they were already all asleep. We entered through the {{unlocked}} door into the building where the women were sleeping, and woke them up, telling them quietly to get dressed at once, as {{they were to be}} taken to a safe place because of the possibility of an armed attack. They obeyed silently. We tied their hands behind their backs there and then, blindfolded them, and let them out to the cart, which was already waiting by the school, sat them in it, and sent them off to their destination. After <b>that,</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> into the room occupied by the men. We told them the same story as we had told the women. The young princes Konstantinovich (KR's sons) and Prince Paley also obeyed meekly. We took them out into the corridor, blindfolded them, bound their hands behind their backs, and put them in another cart. We had earlier decided that the carts should not go together. The only one to try to oppose us was Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich. Physically he was stronger than the rest. We had to grapple with him. He told us categorically {{that he was not going}} anywhere, as he knew they all were going to be killed. He barricaded himself behind the cupboard and our efforts to get him out were in vain. We lost precious time. I finally lost my patience and shot at the Grand Duke. However, I only fired with the intention of wounding him slightly and frightening him into submission. I wounded him in the arm. He did not resist further. I bound his hand and covered his eyes. We put him in the last cart and set off. We were in a great hurry: already the dawn was heralding morning. Along the way, Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich again repeated that he knew they were all going to be killed. “ Tell me why? He asked. “ I have never been involved in politics. I loved sports, played billiards, and was interested in numismatics. “ I reassured him as best as I could. although I was very agitated myself by everything I have been through that night. Despite his wounded arm, the Grand Duke did not complain. At last, we arrived at the mine. The shaft was not very deep and as it turned out had a ledge on one side that was not covered by water.” ...|$|E

"But {{no matter}} how consecrated we feel now," [...] he said, [...] "we mustn't forget <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> into the church for {{precisely}} the same reason <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>went</b> to the Vienna Cafe for breakfast--to gratify an aesthetic sense, to renew the faded pleasure of travel for a moment, {{to get back into}} the Europe of our youth.
