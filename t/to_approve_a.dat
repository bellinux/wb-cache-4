5|$|At {{the end of}} May 2016 Connecticut is {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>a</b> plan which will give Bridgewater Associates $22 million in grants and loans in exchange for job training, job creation, and building renovations. The company also must agree to retain 1,402 jobs they already support in Connecticut. The company could also become eligible {{for as much as}} $30 million in urban tax credits.|$|E
5|$|By April 2009, {{construction}} {{had begun}} on South Australia's third uranium mine— the Honeymoon Uranium Mine. In October 2009, the Australian government was continuing {{to plan for}} a nuclear waste dump in the Northern Territory. However, there was opposition from indigenous people, the NT government, and wider NT community. In November 2009, about 100 anti-nuclear protesters assembled outside the Alice Springs parliamentary sittings, urging the Northern Territory Government not <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>a</b> nearby uranium mine site.|$|E
5|$|He {{has pledged}} never {{to raise taxes}} and states he has never voted <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>a</b> budget deficit. Paul {{believes}} that the country could abolish the individual income tax by scaling back federal spending to its fiscal year 2000 levels; financing government operations would be primarily by excise taxes and non-protectionist tariffs. He endorses eliminating most federal government agencies, terming them unnecessary bureaucracies.|$|E

5|$|On 10 March 1972, {{just before}} the newly renamed Constituent Assembly was <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>a</b> revised constitution, Lon Nol {{announced}} that he was suspending the deliberations. He then forced Cheng Heng, the chief of state since Sihanouk's deposition, to surrender his authority to him. On the second anniversary of the coup, Lon Nol relinquished his authority as chief of state, but retained his position as prime minister and defense minister.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution of Croatia {{mandates}} that the parliament consists {{of at least}} 100 members {{and no more than}} 160 members, elected by a direct secret ballot for four-year terms. Parliamentary elections are held within 60 days following the term's expiration or parliamentary dissolution (the latter takes place with a parliamentary no-confidence vote or if the parliament fails <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>a</b> state budget within 120days after the government submits one for approval), and a new parliament must convene within 20 days after the elections.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the events}} {{happening}} in Cuba at the time, Betances thought that his diplomatic work {{was more important}} than ever. However, his failing health (he had uremia, and since his lungs could not exchange oxygen properly this put extra burden to his heart and kidneys) prevented Betances from performing further diplomatic work from France on behalf of Puerto Rico or Cuba. His illness, which lasted more than a year, prevented him from performing medical work, and forced the Party <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>a</b> stipend for Betances during his long illness, until his death.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, the Michigan Department of State Highways {{petitioned the}} American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>a</b> Bus. US 41 {{designation}} for the trunkline. Action on the request was deferred by AASHTO's U.S. Route Numbering Subcommittee, and then denied the following year. The {{western end of}} Bus. M-28 was rerouted on June 4, 1999, when the City of Ishpeming petitioned MDOT to reroute the highway along Lakeshore Drive to US41/M-28. Previously, it ran along Greenwood Street and North Lake Road and met US41/M-28 in the West Ishpeming neighborhood of Ishpeming Township.|$|E
5|$|After {{a decade}} of {{constant}} warfare, France and Britain signed the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802, bringing the Revolutionary Wars to an end. Amiens called for the withdrawal of British troops from recently conquered colonial territories {{as well as for}} assurances to curtail the expansionary goals of the French Republic. With Europe at peace and the economy recovering, Napoleon's popularity soared to its highest levels under the Consulate, both domestically and abroad. In a new plebiscite during the spring of 1802, the French public came out in huge numbers <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>a</b> constitution that made the Consulate permanent, essentially elevating Napoleon to dictator for life. Whereas the plebiscite two years earlier had brought out 1.5 million people to the polls, the new referendum enticed 3.6 million to go and vote (72% of all eligible voters). There was no secret ballot in 1802 and few people wanted to openly defy the regime; the constitution gained approval with over 99% of the vote. His broad powers were spelled out in the new constitution: Article 1. The French people name, and the Senate proclaims Napoleon-Bonaparte First Consul for Life. After 1802, he was generally referred to as Napoleon rather than Bonaparte.|$|E
5|$|Ferry {{implementation}} required {{permission from}} several entities. Before the ferry could start service, the NYCDOT was required <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>a</b> new transportation mode within its service area. Additionally, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and United States Army Corps of Engineers (CoE) {{was supposed to}} give NYC Ferry permission to use of the landings, with the United States Coast Guard advising the CoE's approval of a permit as well as monitoring the design of vessels. In addition, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation had to allow ferries to use the landing at Gantry Plaza State Park, and the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation was consulted so they could give permission for the Roosevelt Island landing to be built. By September 2016, the Gantry Plaza landing had been approved.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{construction}} of newer, relatively luxurious minor league ballparks, Greer Stadium had fallen below the standards set for Triple-A stadiums by professional baseball in 1990. At the time, team president Larry Schmittou tried to convince the city <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>a</b> new ballpark, but was unsuccessful. Throughout the 2000s, the team continued in its attempts to gather approval and financing for a new ballpark to replace Greer. At one point, a new stadium, First Tennessee Field, was planned for construction {{on the west bank}} of the Cumberland River in downtown. Disagreements over who would pay for the ballpark repeatedly pushed back opening day at the stadium, and eventually resulted in the cancellation of the project altogether. In the meantime, numerous upgrades and repairs, including over $2.5million worth of improvements from 2008 to 2009, were made to Greer in order to preserve its functionality until a new stadium could be built. A deal for such a new ballpark was achieved in late 2013. The Sounds played their final game at Greer on August 27, 2014.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{agreement}} was ineffective in the meantime. The VNQDD kidnapped Giap and the Propaganda Minister Tran Huy Lieu and held them for three weeks until Ho agreed to remove Giáp and Lieu from the cabinet. As a result, the VNQDD's Vũ Hồng Khanh became defence minister, with Giap as his deputy. What the VNQDD and other non-communist nationalists thought to be an equitable power-sharing agreement {{turned out to be}} a ruse. Every non-communist minister had a communist deputy, and if the former refused <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>a</b> decree, the Vietminh official would do so. Many ministers were excluded from knowing the details of their portfolio; Khanh was forbidden to see any military statistics and some were forbidden to attend cabinet meetings. In one case, the Minister of Social Works became a factory worker because he was forced to remain politically idle. Meanwhile, Giáp was able to stymie the activities of VNQDD officials of higher rank in the coalition government. Aside from shutting down the ability of the VNQDD officials to disseminate information, he often ordered his men to start riots and street brawls at public VNQDD events.|$|E
5|$|Below {{the central}} level {{there are several}} {{commissions}} for discipline inspection (CDI). The CDI's composition is decided by the CDI a level above it, and endorsed by its party committee and the committee superior to it; the establishment of discipline commissions {{at the local level}} is decided by the upper-level party committee. The main duties and responsibilities of local CDIs are to educate party members on their duties and rights, preserve party discipline, uphold party decisions, see that party members exercise their duties in accordance with the party constitution, examine cases and investigate corruption. It is expected to report its findings regularly to its corresponding-level party committee. If a member of the local party committee is involved in corruption, the local CDI should ask the party committee at the corresponding level and the CDI at the level above <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>a</b> full investigation. Before the 2014 reforms it was difficult for the CDIs to carry out their responsibilities; although they no longer needed approval from the secretary of the corresponding-level party committee, CDI officials were often appointed to positions of power within the institutions they were tasked to supervise (see above). The 2004 reforms increased CDI independence from the party committee; they were previously elected by the corresponding-level party committee, but beginning in 2004 CDI membership was selected by the upper-level CDI. The 3rd Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee in 2013 again reformed the CCDI's structure, with each CDI directly responsible to the CCDI.|$|E
50|$|In 1884, Reynolds {{served as}} a city {{commissioner}} in Winston-Salem. Reynolds established progressive working conditions in his factory, with shorter hours and higher pay. He also signed a petition for a property tax to pay for public schools and voted <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>an</b> income tax.|$|R
5000|$|When Macross debuted on 3 October 1982 (with {{only three}} episodes made so far) its {{stunning}} success among Japanese television audiences convinced Big West <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>an</b> extension <b>to</b> 36 episodes, allowing {{the staff to}} end with the [...] "two years after" [...] story arc.|$|R
50|$|No fair {{was held}} in 1930 or 1931 due to the legislature's refusal <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>an</b> {{operating}} budget. The fair, however, was again held from 1932 through 1936 but these were not considered a success. Therefore, the legislature abolished the State Fair and none were held in 1937 or 1938.|$|R
5|$|The MAUD {{reports were}} {{reviewed}} by the Defence Services Panel of the Scientific Advisory Committee. This was chaired by Lord Hankey, with its other members being Sir Edward Appleton, Sir Henry Dale, Alfred Egerton, Archibald Hill and Edward Mellanby. The panel held seven meetings in September 1941, and submitted its report to the Lord President of the Council, Sir John Anderson. At this point it was feared that German scientists were attempting to provide their country with an atomic bomb, and thus Britain needed to finish its first. The report ultimately stated {{that if there were}} even a sliver of a chance that the bomb effort could produce a weapon with such power, then every effort should be made to make sure Britain did not fall behind. It recommended that while a pilot separation plant be built in Britain, the production facility should be built in Canada. The Defence Services Panel submitted its report on 24 September 1941, but by this time the final decision had already been taken. Lord Cherwell had taken the matter to the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, who became the first national leader <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>a</b> nuclear weapons programme on 30 August 1941. The Chiefs of Staff Committee supported the decision.|$|E

50|$|In December 2007, the New Zealand Conservation Authority {{decided not}} <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>an</b> {{amendment}} <b>to</b> the Mount Aspiring National Park Management Plan {{that would have}} allowed the tunnel to be built in the Mount Aspiring National Park. The plan amendment had been supported by the Otago Conservation Board and the Director-General of Conservation.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, the Board asked voters <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>an</b> {{additional}} 8 {{mills in}} ad valorem taxes. Officials were criticized for spending {{in excess of}} $150,000 to promote passage of the new taxes. The Alabama State Auditor asked the state Attorney General to convene a Grand Jury to examine the expenditures. In April 2015 voters refused <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> the new taxes and defunded $14 million in taxes which were due for renewal.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{submissions}} {{have been made}} in relation <b>to</b> <b>approving</b> <b>an</b> official unit badge that would be worn on the hats of serving members but at this stage, none have been approved.

The AA withdrew from the National Committee, and the organizing effort and strike ended.|$|E
25|$|The {{athletic}} department considered {{a move to}} Division I in 2011. The student body would have needed <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>a</b> doubling of student fees to allow the university to meet minimum scholarship requirements for D-I participation. However, students overwhelmingly rejected this measure in 2012, halting any efforts for a move to Division I.|$|E
50|$|Members of Carroll County Health Services Corporation, {{parent company}} of Carroll Hospital, voted on March 27, 2015 <b>to</b> <b>approve</b> <b>an</b> {{affiliation}} agreement with LifeBridge Health to offer new services and expanded care {{for the people of}} Carroll County and the greater Baltimore region. On April 1, 2015, Carroll Hospital became a subsidiary of LifeBridge Health.|$|R
50|$|Western Australia {{formerly}} required sterilization prior <b>to</b> <b>approving</b> <b>a</b> {{change in}} sex classification.
