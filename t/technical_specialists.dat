There was little information about developments in northern Italy and Germany. The Alsos Mission was attached to Colonel George Smith's S-Force. Built around a Royal Air Force ground reconnaissance squadron equipped with armored cars, this unit contained American, British, French, and Italian <b>technical</b> <b>specialists</b> of various kinds who would enter Rome {{on the heels of the}} advancing Allied forces. The expectation that Rome would soon be captured proved premature, and by March 1944 most of the Alsos Mission had returned to the United States. The Alsos Mission had gathered little of value about nuclear matters, but submitted detailed reports about German rockets and guided missiles.|$|E

25|$|When the United States entered World War I in 1917, by law of Congress, {{all male}} college {{students}} {{were subject to}} military training. In the spring of 1918, Pitt began training students for war-related industrial work. The United States Army built seven frame barracks for housing 1,000 men, a 2,000 seat mess hall, an administrative building and a YMCA Hospitality House on the hillside campus. In September of that year, the federal government announced it was taking control {{of colleges and universities}} for the training of officers and <b>technical</b> <b>specialists</b> in the Student Army Training Corps (SATC), but by November 11, Germany had surrendered and by December all student soldiers were out of the armed services. The war activity had caused a major influx of students to Pitt and a corresponding shortage of space. The barracks, meant to be temporary, were used for some time to help alleviate congestion, but it was apparent that this was an inadequate solution; by 1920, Pitt alumni had begun a campaign to fund construction of a sorely-needed new building. The campaign was a success, raising $670,000 ($70,000 more than was needed), due in part to both the excitement of alumni with the championship caliber play of the Pitt football team (national champions or undefeated in 1910, 1915, 1916, 1917, 1918 and 1920) and by a $100,000 contribution directly from the Athletic Committee's football receipts. By 1921, Alumni Hall (now known as Eberly Hall), designed by Benno Janssen (the runner-up for the previous campus plan architectural competition), was dedicated. It signified a departure from (and end to) the Acropolis Plan. This enthusiasm for football would also lead to the construction of Pitt Stadium in 1925.|$|E

2500|$|Near {{the close}} {{and after the}} end of World War II in Europe, the Russians and the Western powers had {{programs}} to foster technology transfer and exploit German <b>technical</b> <b>specialists.</b> [...] For example, the U.S. had Operation Paperclip [...] and the Russians had trophy brigades advancing with their military forces. [...] In the area of atomic technology, the U.S. had Operation Alsos and the Russians had their version. [...] While operational aspects of the Russian operation were modeled after the trophy brigades, a more refined approach was warranted for the exploitation of German atomic related facilities, intellectual materials, and scientific personnel. [...] This was rectified with a decree in late 1944 and the formation of specialize exploitation teams in early 1945 under the Russian Alsos, which had broader objectives, which included wholesale relocation of scientific facilities to the Soviet Union.|$|E

Even as Hanoi embraced China's international line, it continued to follow the Soviet model of reliance on <b>technical</b> <b>specialists</b> and bureaucratic management, as opposed to mass mobilization. The winter of 1964–1965 was a high-water mark for the Việt Cộng, with the Saigon government on the verge of collapse.

2500|$|Estimating when Iran might {{possibly}} achieve nuclear [...] "breakout" [...] capability, defined as having produced a sufficient quantity of {{highly enriched uranium}} to fuel a weapon – if a working design for one existed and the political decision to assemble it was made – is uncertain. [...] A detailed analysis by physicists at the Federation of American Scientists concludes that such an estimate {{would depend on the}} total number and overall efficiency of the centrifuges Iran has in operation, and the amount of low-enriched uranium it has stockpiled to serve as [...] "feedstock" [...] for a possible high-enrichment program. A 23 March 2012 U.S. Congressional Research Service report quotes 24 February 2012 IAEA report saying that Iran has stockpiled 240 pounds of 20-percent-enriched uranium – an enrichment level necessary for medical applications – as an indication of their capacity to enrich to higher levels. The authoritarian political culture of Iran may pose additional challenges to a scientific program requiring cooperation among many <b>technical</b> <b>specialists.</b> Some experts argue that the intense focus on Iran's nuclear program detracts from a need for broader diplomatic engagement with the Islamic Republic. U.S. intelligence agency officials interviewed by The New York Times in March 2012 said they continued to assess that Iran had not restarted its weaponization program, which the 2007 National Intelligence Estimate said Iran had discontinued in 2003, although they have found evidence that some weaponization-related activities have continued.
