James Doakes (Erik King) and Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter) visit the hotel, where they find a room completely covered in blood. Dexter is sent in first to investigate, but seeing the blood-covered room brings back a repressed memory from his childhood— Dexter at the age of three years sitting in a pool of blood—and he collapses and runs from the room. The forensics team surmises that the blood in the hotel room came from at least five different bodies, although none were in the room. Since there were only one set of footprints in the room, <b>they</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> the victims were killed elsewhere and their blood spread around the room by the killer. Debra suggests that the Ice Truck Killer, who had five bloodless victims, may have been responsible.|$|E

25|$|Dreyfus also {{identified}} a subtler assumption about the world.

This assumes that everything that exists can be understood as objects, properties of objects, classes of objects, relations of objects, and so on: precisely those things that can be described by logic, language and mathematics. The question of what exists is called ontology, and so Dreyfus calls this the ontological assumption. If this is false, then it raises doubts about what we can ultimately know and what intelligent machines will ultimately be able to help us to do.|$|E

Another limitation of this approach is that it may not work in public Wi-Fi hot spots, where people come and leave frequently.

25|$|According to a meta-analysis, it was {{discovered}} that direct lobbying is used alongside grassroots lobbying. There is evidence that groups {{are much more likely to}} directly lobby previous allies rather than opponents. Allies are also directly lobbied if a counter lobby is brought to light. The results suggest that groups lobby in ways designed obtain the most influence for their view. When groups have strong ties to a legislator's district, those groups will use a combination of grassroots and direct lobbying, even if the legislator's original position does not support theirs, which may help groups expand their supportive coalitions. When strong district ties are not present, groups tend to rely on direct lobbying with committee allies, because <b>they</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> their political friends will be drawn to participate with the lobbyist view.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 J. Allan Hobson and Robert McCarley {{proposed}} {{a new theory}} that changed dream research, challenging the previously held Freudian view of dreams as unconscious wishes to be interpreted. <b>They</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> the same structures that induce REM sleep also generate sensory information. Hobson's 1976 research suggested that the signals interpreted as dreams originate in the brainstem during REM sleep. According to Hobson and other researchers, circuits in the brainstem are activated during REM sleep. Once these circuits are activated, areas of the limbic system involved in emotions, sensations, and memories, including the amygdala and hippocampus, become active. The brain synthesizes and interprets these activities; for example, changes in the physical environment such as temperature and humidity, or physical stimuli such as ejaculation, and attempts to create meaning from these signals, result in dreaming.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{assumptions}} underlie their game theoretic model, {{and allow for}} the authors' simplified model of society. First, Acemoglu and Robinson assume that society is simply divided between a small rich class and a large poor class. Second, <b>they</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> regimes must be either democratic or nondemocratic; {{there is nothing in}} between. Third, people's preferences in society are defined only by monetary redistribution from the rich ruling class. The more monetary benefits they get, the more they prefer the ruling class. Fourth, people care not only about redistribution today but also redistribution in the future. Therefore, people would not only want more redistribution today but also they want to see a guarantee for more or stable redistribution in the future. Fifth, the economic output of a country fluctuates year by year, which means revolution is less costly for the ruling class during economic downturn. Finally and most importantly, each individual in the society tries to maximize their own utility.|$|E
25|$|Most historians {{view the}} gospels {{not as an}} {{objective}} account of Jesus, but {{as the product of}} men writing at a particular period, and grappling with particular theological as well as political issues. Specifically, <b>they</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> after Jesus' death his sayings and stories about him circulated among his followers until, {{at some point in the}} mid-1st century someone (or group of people) wrote down his sayings in Greek (see Q source) and someone edited and organized stories about his life into a historical narrative, the Gospel of Mark. As these two documents circulated among Christians, other historical narratives were edited and organized. The four gospels ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were regionally authoritative by proto-orthodoxy by the 2nd century. Some historians have suggested that between Nero's persecution of Christians in 64 CE, and the Jewish revolt in 66 CE, Gentile Christians saw more sense in assigning Jews, rather than Romans, responsibility for Jesus' death.|$|E

Some fire safety experts have also questioned why so many firefighters were in a burning building with a steel truss roof, which is known to be a serious safety hazard for firefighters. A routine fire preplan of the structure in June 2006 made no mention of its roof construction, and it has been suggested that CFD firefighters did not pull the ceiling to check for extension into the roof structure.|$|E

25|$|Generally, {{there are}} few reports about how many people disaffiliating from Islam in Muslim {{majority}} countries.

However, the report also suggest that in future, {{it is also possible that}} these societies could allow for greater freedom to religiously disaffiliate. On the other hand the increasingly large ex-Muslim communities in the Western world that adhere to no religion have been well documented. A 2007 Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) report argued that some Muslim population projections are overestimated, as <b>they</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> all descendants of Muslims will become Muslims even in cases of mixed parenthood. Equally, Darren E. Sherkat questioned in Foreign Affairs whether some of the Muslim growth projections are accurate as they do not take into account the increasing number of non-religious Muslims. Quantitative research is lacking, but he believes the European trend mirrors the American: data from the General Social Survey in the United States show that 32 percent of those raised Muslim no longer embrace Islam in adulthood, and 18 percent hold no religious identification. Studies show that about half of the 4.2 million persons from Muslim background in Germany are no longer embrace Islam in adulthood. Many of the Muslims who leaves Islam faces social rejection or imprisonment and sometimes murder or penalty. According to Harvard University professor Robert D. Putnam, there is increasing numbers of Americans who are leaving their faith and becoming unaffiliated and the average Iranian is slightly less religious than the average American. According to Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans, the number of Iranian Americans Muslims decreased from 42% in 2008 to 31% in 2012. On the other hand, conversion into Islam have also been well documented.|$|E
