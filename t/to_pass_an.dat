5|$|The en passant capture {{rule was}} {{added in the}} 15th century when the rule that gave pawns an initial double-step move was introduced. It {{prevents}} a pawn from using the two-square advance <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> adjacent enemy pawn without {{the risk of being}} captured.|$|E
5|$|Johnston went to Washington in December {{in hopes}} that Virginia would be readmitted to the Union. It was, however, not until January 26, 1870, that Virginia was readmitted; Johnston {{was able to take}} his seat shortly afterward. The delay was due to a Congressional need <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> act that would allow Virginia {{representation}} in the body.|$|E

50|$|Every {{enactment}} conferring {{power on}} <b>a</b> court <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> sentence of penal servitude {{in any case}} must be construed as conferring power <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding the maximum term of penal servitude for which a sentence could have been passed in that case immediately before 12 June 1950. But this does not empower any court, other than the High Court, <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding three years.|$|R
50|$|<b>To</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> National Course (such as for example, Higher Mathematics), {{students}} have <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> number of National Units that are internally assessed, {{as well as}} <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> final externally assessed examination. Unit assessments are unseen and should a student fail an assessment opportunity, only one re-sit opportunity is provided using a fresh unseen assessment. (A second re-sit opportunity is only allowed in exceptional circumstances.) Failure <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> National Unit at Higher level would mean that a student would be unable <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> the National Course at Higher level that year, though they may successfully complete a number of National Units.|$|R

5|$|The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn The {{membership}} and ritual of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn were strongly linked to Freemasonry, but membership {{was open to}} non-masons and to women. The grades formed a teaching system for the Kabbalah, and initiates had <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> exam before being allowed {{to advance to the}} next degree.|$|E
5|$|After {{involving}} {{itself in}} the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War, France found itself financially ruined. Attempts <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> economic plan to alleviate this in the Estates-General of 1789 led instead to the third estate—the commoners—forking to form the National Assembly. Succeeded in turn by the National Constituent Assembly and the Legislative Assembly, the various legislative bodies succeeded in rendering the monarchy constitutional, limited by democratic institutions. Attempts to remove the monarch entirely, although thwarted on 20 June 1792, led to the effective overthrow of Louis XVI on 10 August. On 21 October, France was formally declared a republic.|$|E
50|$|California was {{the first}} U.S. state <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> no-fault divorce law. Its law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan and came into effect on January 1, 1970. New York was the last state <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>a</b> no-fault divorce law; that law was passed in 2010.|$|R

5|$|Romney Academy trustee John Baker White was a {{clerk of}} both the circuit and county courts of Hampshire County and {{was the father of}} Robert White, Attorney General of West Virginia from 1877 until 1881. Robert White {{successfully}} lobbied the West Virginia Legislature <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> act establishing the Institution for the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind of West Virginia (later named the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind), which utilized the former campus of the Romney Classical Institute, a successor educational institution to Romney Academy. Another trustee, Angus William McDonald, was the father of Marshall McDonald, who served as commissioner of the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries from 1888 until 1895.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after being sworn in, Cooper co-sponsored his first piece of legislation, a bill to provide federal aid for education. The bill passed the Senate, but not the House. Cooper was made {{chairman}} of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Roads, and helped draft a bill authorizing $900million in federal funds to states for highway construction. In 1948, he sponsored a bill to provide price support for burley tobacco at 90 percent of parity. He insisted on {{an amendment to the}} War Claims Act of 1948 that benefits to veterans injured as prisoners of war of the Germans and Japanese during World War II be paid immediately using enemy assets. He also co-sponsored legislation allowing {{hundreds of thousands of people}} displaced by the Nazis to enter the United States legally. He opposed bans on industrywide collective bargaining for organized labor and on the establishment of closed shops. He voted against putting union welfare funds under government control, but helped <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> amendment forbidding compulsory union membership for workers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, for mainly {{patriotic}} reasons, the Australian Natives' Association helped establish the Federation League, a society {{dedicated to the}} creation of a federal nation. Following a series of addresses by the future Prime Minister, Edmund Barton to large crowds, some 15 League branches were established in the towns along the southern border. One of these towns, Corowa, was the location for the first conference of the Australian Federation League in 1893. At this conference, Dr John Quick, a delegate from Bendigo, proposed a resolution calling for the colonial legislatures <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> act providing for the election of representatives to a convention to develop a federal constitution. This has been seen as the turning point in the push for Federation. The momentum generated from this point lead to a series of conventions and elections and finally, the inauguration of a federal constitution on 1 January 1901.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 1844, Philadelphia {{passed an}} {{ordinance}} {{that gave the}} city a battalion of artillery, a regiment of infantry {{and at least one}} full troop of cavalry for the purpose of providing the preservation of peace within the city when necessary. The difficulty of quelling the riots and other crime led to the Pennsylvania General Assembly <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> 1845 act that required Philadelphia, the township of Moyamensing and the unincorporated districts of Spring Garden, Northern Liberties, and Penn to maintain a police force of one man per 150 taxable inhabitants. In 1850, another act was passed that established that the Philadelphia police force would police the city and seven surrounding districts. The inability to maintain order effectively in Philadelphia's suburbs would be an important argument for the consolidation of the city in 1854.|$|E
5|$|Randall's {{determination}} to cut spending, combined with Southern Democrats' desire to reduce federal power {{in their home}} states, led the House <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> army appropriation bill with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which {{had been used to}} suppress the Ku Klux Klan. The Enforcement Acts, passed during Reconstruction over Democratic opposition, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed. Randall's role in the process was limited, but the Democrats' failure to force Hayes's acquiescence weakened his appeal as a potential presidential candidate in 1880.|$|E

5|$|The General Assembly was {{controlled}} by Democrats, but Nunn was able to pass most of his agenda. Despite a campaign promise not to raise taxes, when the outgoing Breathitt administration projected a shortfall of $24 million in the state budget, Nunn convinced the General Assembly <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> increase in the motor vehicle license fee from $5.00 to $12.50 and raise the state sales tax from three percent to five percent. Nunn's budget focused on increased funding for education, mental health, and economic development. In the 1970 legislative session, the General Assembly enacted Nunn's proposals to eliminate taxes on prescription drugs and the use fee charged on vehicles transferred within families, but rejected his plans to reduce the income tax for low-income families and increase tax credits for the blind and the elderly.|$|E
5|$|The new {{constitution}} {{led to the}} gradual erosion of the Democratic majority. In 1854, the Republican Party was established and drew {{in many of the}} former Whigs. That year the General Assembly was split with no party attaining a majority. The Democrats held the largest number of seats, but the Whigs and Republicans caucused to form a majority and control the assembly. The result was deadlock on most issues because Republicans and Whigs could not agree on most major issues. By 1858, the Whigs were almost completely disempowered and the Republicans gained enough seats to become the largest party, but not enough to form a majority on their own. That year Governor Ashbel P. Willard called the first special session of the General Assembly because they had been unable <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> appropriations bill. Democrats regained a small majority by gaining the votes of the disaffected Whigs in the 1860 election.|$|E
5|$|The {{syndicated}} version's potential contestants, {{depending on}} tryouts, are required <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> electronically scored test comprising {{a set of}} thirty questions which must be answered within a 10-minute time limit. Contestants who fail the test are eliminated, while those who pass are interviewed for an audition by the production staff, and those who impress the staff the most are then notified by postal mail {{that they have been}} placed into a pool for possible selection as contestants. At the producers' discretion, contestants from said pool are selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program; these contestants are given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the information on their initial application form and verify that they meet all eligibility requirements. Afterwards, they are given a date to travel to the show's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show. Unlike its ABC counterpart, the syndicated version does not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company's expense; that version's contestants are instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own.|$|E

5|$|Madhavan's {{parents are}} Ranganathan Seshadri and Saroja. Despite Madhavan's {{ambition}} {{of wanting to}} join the army, his parents insisted he go to management school and pursue a degree in electronics. After completing the degree, {{he went on to}} teach communication and public speaking at workshops around India. At the Maharashtra workshop, he encountered his wife Sarita Birje for the first time during 1991, when she attended his class on the recommendation of her cousins. Sarita was able to use the skills she had learned from Madhavan's classes <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> interview to become an air hostess and after completing the course, the pair began dating. They later married in 1999, before Madhavan entered mainstream films. The pair's successful marriage has been covered by the media, with Madhavan citing that advise from his mentor Mani Ratnam was useful. Sarita has worked as a costume designer in a few of Madhavan's films, most notably for Guru En Aalu (2009) when she worked along with Erum Ali, the wife of Madhavan's co-star, Abbas, for their respective husbands. Their son, Vedant was born in August 2005, which eventually led to relocating to the boat-club area in Chennai from Kilpauk, where Madhavan's parents lived with him as well as his parents-in-law. In 2009, he relocated to Kandivali, Mumbai with his wife and son, as he pursued a career in Hindi films ahead of films in the South Indian industries.|$|E
5|$|Norman {{was born}} in Ulverston, Lancashire (now part of the {{administrative}} county of Cumbria), on 6 September 1883 to Thomas Birkett, a draper, and his wife Agnes, who died in 1884 of tuberculosis. He attended the Wesleyan primary school in Ulverston until 1894, {{when he moved to}} Barrow-in-Furness Grammar School. Although intelligent, Birkett was not noted as a particularly academic student and spent as much time on practical jokes as he did on his studies. He left school in 1898, starting work as an apprentice in one of the draper's shops owned by his father and beginning to preach. He was a popular local preacher on the local Methodist circuit, and, on deciding that he was unlikely to be a good draper, his father allowed him to leave the business in 1904 to become a minister under Charles Bedale. In 1905, Bedale suggested Birkett should go to Cambridge University to study history and theology. Birkett liked the idea, having previously conversed with A. C. Benson, the Master of Magdalene College, and applied to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. The college offered him a place, with the condition that he would have <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>an</b> entrance examination and complete the responsions to be accepted into the university as a whole. He spent three months learning Latin and Greek and was accepted into the university in October 1907.|$|E
