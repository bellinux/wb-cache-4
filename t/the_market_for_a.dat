The Spanish sportspaper Marca immediately linked him together with Dutch side Feyenoord. This was at first denied by Tomasson as pure speculation. The speculations, however soon turned out to be true. In July 2008, he left Villarreal on a free transfer, and returned to Feyenoord on a new three-year contract. Here he got off to a great start with four goals in three games. But unfortunately this was followed by a long time injury from the end of September until the end of January. And because of that, he could only play a total of 14 games for Feyenoord in 2008–09.|$|E
25|$|Between 1917 and 1922, the Fordson was for {{tractors}} {{somewhat like}} the Ford Model T was for automobiles—it captured the public's imagination and widely popularized the machine, with a reliable design, {{a low price}} affordable for workers and farmers, a widespread dealership network, and a production capacity for large numbers. Just as the Model T helped the public to appreciate how soon cars and trucks might replace most horses in transport, the Fordson helped people to appreciate how soon tractors might replace most horses in farming (advancing the mechanisation of agriculture). As with cars, Ford never had the market to itself, but it dominated <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time (for cars, roughly 1910-1925; for tractors, roughly 1917-1925).

25|$|Scotsman James Stokes {{had arrived}} in Western Australia in 1834 {{at the age of}} 24. He saw the {{opportunity}} in <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> brewery, and investigated potential sites. Surveyor-General John Septimus Roe had set aside a small triangular lot for use as a brewery; this block was bounded by Spring Street, Mount Street and St Georges Terrace. Stokes preferred the much larger block across Spring Street, which extended almost {{all the way to the}} riverfront. The site was more suitable because it featured a natural spring, there was a sufficient different in elevation to enable the use of gravity in the brewing process without the need for a large tower. The proximity to the river also made river transport an attractive option. Stokes bought this land from George Leake, and was operating his brewery by 1837. Although the brewery was named the Albion Brewery after the ancient name for Great Britain, it was more popularly known as Stokes' Brewery. It was the colony's first major stand-alone brewery.|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{leather shoes}} and boots became {{affordable}} to the masses, and with the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the demand for large numbers of polished army boots led to a need in <b>the</b> <b>market</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> product that would allow boots to be polished quickly, efficiently and easily. [...] The polish was also used to shine leather belts, handgun holsters, and horse tack. This demand led to a rapid increase in the sales of shoe and boot polish. The popularity of Kiwi shoe polish spread throughout the British Commonwealth and the United States. Rival brands began to emerge, including Shinola and Cavalier (United States), Cherry Blossom (United Kingdom), Parwa (India), Jean Bart (France), and many others. Advertising became more prominent; many shoe polish brands used fictional figures or historical characters to spread awareness of their products. [...] In the German documentary of 1927 Berlin: Symphony of a Great City, a scene focuses on shoe shining with a polish called Nigrin sporting the face of a Negro.|$|E
