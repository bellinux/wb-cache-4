5000|$|The koa's trunk {{was used}} by ancient Hawaiians to build waa (dugout {{outrigger}} canoes) and papa hee nalu (surfboards). Only paipo (bodyboards), kikoo, and alaia surfboards were made from koa, however; olo, the longest surfboards, were made from the lighter and more buoyant wiliwili (Erythrina sandwicensis). [...] The reddish wood is very similar in strength and weight to that of Black Walnut (Juglans nigra), with a specific gravity of 0.55, and is sought for use in wood carving and furniture. [...] Koa is also a tonewood, often used {{in the construction of}} ukuleles, acoustic guitars, and Weissenborn-style Hawaiian steel guitars. B.C. Rich used koa on some of their electric guitars as well, [...] and still uses a koa-veneered <b>topwood</b> on certain models. Fender made limited edition koa wood models of the Telecaster and the Stratocaster in 2006. Trey Anastasio, guitarist for the band Phish, primarily uses a koa hollowbody Languedoc guitar. Commercial silviculture of koa takes 20 to 25 years before a tree is of useful size.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of <b>TOPWOOD</b> {{is to build}} a four-year scientific exchange program about the test and development of medium and high-throughput phenotyping measurement and analysis tools for selected basic wood properties in the laboratory and in the field (TOols for Phenotyping WOOD-TOPWOOD). The participants wish to exchange knowledge and experience for sharing and expanding skills, improving existing tools and developing new original measuring devices for wood properties involved in studies of wood quality and of wood biological functions. The phenotyping tools and methods of analysis developed and improved in <b>TOPWOOD</b> are intended to be used by the participants to investigate the genetic and environmental determinism of key wood properties involved in forest tree adaptation, as well as in wood production and wood quality for the forest and wood industries. The participants of <b>TOPWOOD</b> are three academic institutions and one private company from three European Union countries, Austria, France and Spain, and one third country, Argentina. <b>TOPWOOD</b> WP 1 is dedicated to the measurement of basic wood properties involved in wood quality (using near infrared spectroscopy, microdensity and ultrasonic approach). WP 2 aims at studying and developing measuring devices for wood functional traits (wood hydraulic conductivity, vulnerability to cavitation and the dynamics of wood formation). WP 3 aims at developing, discussing and disseminating data analysis methods dedicated to the large and complex data sets generated by these measuring devices. Finally WP 4 is dedicated to coordination, management and dissemination...|$|E
