500|$|The bonshō {{is derived}} from the bianzhong ( [...] in Japanese), an ancient Chinese court {{instrument}} comprising a series of tuned bells. One larger additional bell, which eventually developed into the bonshō, was used as a <b>tuning</b> <b>device</b> and a summons to listeners to attend a bianzhong recital. According to legend, the earliest bonshō may have come from China to Japan via the Korean Peninsula. The Nihon Shoki records that Ōtomo no Satehiko brought three bronze bells back to Japan in 562 as spoils of war from Goguryeo.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, {{the strings}} were {{wrapped around the}} goose feet, {{but there has been}} a device that has been invented, which is a block of wood {{attached}} to the goose feet, with pins similar to those used to tune the guzheng protruding out at the sides, so one can string and tune the qin using a tuning wrench. This is good for those who lack the physical strength to pull and add tension to the strings when wrapping the ends to the goose feet. However, the <b>tuning</b> <b>device</b> looks rather unsightly and thus many qin players prefer the traditional manner of tuning; many also feel that the strings should be firmly wrapped to the goose feet in order that the sound may be [...] "grounded" [...] into the qin and some feel that the device which covers the phoenix pond sound hole has a negative effect on the sound volume and quality.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discussed}} {{the design and}} performances of a liquid crystal phase shifter {{that can be used}} in <b>tuning</b> <b>devices.</b> <b>Tuning</b> <b>devices</b> growth with the demand in the emerging in telecommunication system. <b>Tuning</b> <b>devices</b> with smooth continuous phase shifting at low cost and compact size would be an advantage. This paper proposed a phase shifter using 5 CB liquid crystal material. The advantages of using the material is the smoothness and continuity of the transitions in the phase shift. It is done by having a structure with cavity filled with the liquid crystal and applied with certain voltage that can be changed. The changes in voltage would change the applied electric field, and thus would change the permittivity of the material. The changes would affect the wave propagation and thus contribute to the phase shifting. The performance of the phase shifter was tested by means of simulation using CST Suite 2014 software. The results show that the higher the frequency, the higher the phase shift would occur. The highest FoM achieved is 68 (deg/dB) at 8 GHz. A phase shifter with smooth and continuous phase shift can be used as the feeding network in an array scanning antennas systems...|$|R

5000|$|Pianos {{that are}} prized by their owners are tuned regularly, usually once {{every six months}} for {{domestic}} pianos, and always just before a performance in concert halls. The longer a piano remains out of tune, the more time and effort it will take for a technician to restore it to proper pitch. When a piano is only slightly out of tune, it loses the glowing tonal quality characteristic of a freshly tuned piano, especially because each note {{in the middle and}} upper range is sounded by more than one string, and these may get slightly out of tune with each other. Pianos that are more than slightly out of tune tend to be unpleasant to play and listen to, to an extent that varies with the ear of the listener. A tuning hammer and tuning mutes are the main tools that piano technicians use. Some tuners use pure aural techniques while some tuners use electronic <b>tuning</b> <b>devices.</b> Formally trained and experienced tuners find that the use of electronic <b>tuning</b> <b>devices</b> is unnecessary, important elements associated with trained aural tuners are often left out by those relying on electronic <b>tuning</b> <b>devices.</b> Consistent errors have been known as a result.

40|$|This study investigates energy {{harvesting}} characteristics from a spinning device {{that consists of}} a proof mass that is supported by two orthogonal elastic structures with the piezoelectric material. Deformation in the piezoelectric structures due to vibration of the proof mass generates voltages to power electrical loads. The governing equations for this electromechanically coupled device are derived using Newtonian mechanics and Kirchhoff 2 ̆ 7 s voltage law. The case where the device rotates at a constant speed and is subjected to sinusoidal base excitation is examined in detail. The {{energy harvesting}} behavior is investigated for devices with identical piezoelectric support structures (called <b>tuned</b> <b>devices).</b> Closed-form expressions are derived for the steady state response and power harvested. For nonzero rotation speeds, these devices have multifrequency dynamic response and power harvested due to the combined vibration and rotation of the host system. The average power harvested for one oscillation cycle is calculated {{for a wide range}} of operating conditions to quantify the devices 2 ̆ 7 performance. Resonances do not occur for cases when the base excitation frequency is fixed and the rotation speed varies. For cases of fixed rotation speed and varying base excitation frequency, however, resonances do occur. The number and location of these resonances depend on the electrical circuit resistances and rotation speed. Resonances do not occur at speeds or frequencies predicted by resonance diagrams, which are commonly used in the study of rotating system vibration. These devices have broadband speed energy harvesting ability. They perform equally well at high and low speeds; high speeds are not necessary for their optimal performance. The impact of the chosen damping model on energy harvesting characteristics for <b>tuned</b> <b>devices</b> is investigated. Two common damping models are considered: viscous damping and structural (hysteretic) damping. Closed-form expressions for steady state dynamic response and power harvested are derived for models with viscous and structural damping. The average power harvested using the model with structural damping behaves similarly at high speeds and low speeds, and at high resistances and low resistances. For the viscous damping model, however, the average power harvested is meaningfully different at high speeds compared to low speeds, and at high resistances compared to low resistances. The characteristics of devices with nonidentical piezoelectric support structures (called mistuned devices) are investigated numerically. Similar to spinning <b>tuned</b> <b>devices,</b> mistuned devices have multifrequency dynamic response and power harvested. In contrast to <b>tuned</b> <b>devices,</b> high amplitude average power harvested occurs near speeds and base excitation frequencies predicted by resonance diagram...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{vibration}} of a rotating piezoelectric device {{that consists of}} a proof mass that is supported by elastic structures with piezoelectric layers. Vibration of the proof mass causes deformation in the piezoelectric structures and voltages to power electrical loads. The coupled electromechanical equations of motion are derived using Newtonian mechanics and Krichhoff 2 ̆ 7 s circuit laws. The free vibration behavior is investigated for <b>devices</b> with identical (<b>tuned)</b> and nonidentical (mistuned) piezoelectric support structures and electrical loads. These devices complex-valued have speed-dependent eigenvalues and eigenvectors {{as a result of}} their constant rotation. The imaginary parts of the eigenvalues physically represent the oscillation frequencies of the device. The real parts represent the decay or growth rates of the oscillations, depending on their sign. The complex-valued components of the eigenvectors physically represent the amplitudes and phases of the vibration. The eigenvalue behaviors differ for <b>tuned</b> and mistuned <b>devices.</b> Due to gyroscopic effects, the proof mass in the <b>tuned</b> <b>device</b> only vibrates in either forward or backward decaying circular orbits in single-mode free response. This is proven analytically for all <b>tuned</b> <b>devices.</b> For mistuned devices, the proof mass has decaying elliptical forward and backward orbits. The eigenvalues are shown to be sensitive to changes in the electric load resistances. Closed-form solutions for the eigenvalues are derived for open and close circuits. At high rotation speeds these devices experience critical speeds and instability. Closed-form solutions for the critical speeds are derived. <b>Tuned</b> <b>devices</b> have one degenerate critical speed that separates stable speeds from unstable speeds, where flutter instability occurs. Mistuned devices have two critical speeds. The first critical speed separates stable speeds from speeds where divergence instability occurs. Divergence instability continues for small speeds above the second critical speed. At higher supercritical speeds flutter instability occurs. Transitions between stable and unstable eigenvalues are investigated using root locus diagram. This device has atypical eigenvalue behavior near the critical speeds and stability transitions compared to conventional gyroscopic systems...|$|R
