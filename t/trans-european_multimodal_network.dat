40|$|Many {{networked}} systems involve multiple {{modes of}} transport. Such systems are called multimodal, and examples include logistic and telecommunication networks, biomedical phenomena, conflict resolution models and manufacturing processes. Existing techniques for determining minimal paths in <b>multimodal</b> <b>networks</b> have required either heuristics or else application-specific constraints to obtain tractable problems, removing the multimodal traits {{of the network}} during analysis. In this thesis weighted coloured [...] edge graphs are introduced to model <b>multimodal</b> <b>networks,</b> where colours represent the modes of transportation. Optimal paths are selected using a partial order that compares the total weights in each colour, resulting in a Pareto optimal set of shortest paths. The cardinality of this set {{is at the core}} of the model's tractability. Tractability and applicability of the coloured [...] edge graph are addressed in this work. The tractability is firstly studied experimentally by using random as well as pathological instances of the colored [...] edge graph. Next, upper bounds on the cardinality of the Pareto set are established. An upper bound which is exponential in k (number of colours) is first presented. Subsequently, a probabilistic bound is developed for bicoloured [...] edge graphs whose weights are randomly drawn according to a bounded probability density function. An O(n^ 3) bound on the expected number of minimal paths (where $n$ is the number vertices) is established. The applicability of the approach is studied by means of data obtained from real <b>multimodal</b> transportation <b>networks.</b> Three cases are studied. Case (1) is a comparative analysis based on the multimodal transportation systems of New Zealand and Europe. The data used in the construction of the networks consist of digitized maps obtained from official GIS libraries. Case (2) is a large <b>multimodal</b> <b>network</b> that reproduces transport options in France.

Finally, Case (3) utilizes air traffic information to build a <b>multimodal</b> <b>network</b> with a large number of modes. Modes in this case correspond to different international airlines. An important aspect of this practical study is that the <b>multimodal</b> <b>networks</b> are larger than most of those previously analyzed in the literature. The coloured [...] edge graph is shown in this research to be typically tractable without the need to apply any application [...] specific heuristic or constraints.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{exploration}} into {{the analysis of}} public transport networks using space syntax approaches combined with concepts of sustainable accessibility. Present urban development policy aims to achieve sustainable mobility patterns, shifting mobility to soft transportation modes such as walking and cycling, supported by a more integrated multi?modal public transport system, and understanding how different urban areas can support this objective is an important urban policy and design task. We propose that the description of urban areas in terms of ‘modal environments’ is useful to understand the mobility patterns of their populations. We explore this hypothesis by characterising the neighbourhoods in the Randstad region of the Netherlands {{in terms of public}} transport ‘modal environments’ by measuring the centrality of the public transport infrastructure of the city?region, and compare their centrality to the mobility patterns of the population. The <b>multi?modal</b> <b>network</b> model of the Randstad includes the three main public transport networks, namely rail, tram and metro/light rail, and it is a simple topological undirected network where the stations or stops represent nodes in the graph and the mobility infrastructure defines the links. In order to create a <b>multimodal</b> <b>network</b> we introduce a fourth set of links representing modal interfaces that make the connection between the nodes of the different public transport modes. We then measure the degree, closeness and betweenness centrality of this network and correlate the results with the data of the 2008 Mobility Survey of the Netherlands, aggregated at neighbourhood level. Although the centrality of the <b>multi?modal</b> <b>network</b> does not fully explain the patterns of public transport use in the different neighbourhoods, it seems to offer a possibility of characterising those neighbourhoods in terms of their public transport use potential, i. e. to what extent they can be public transport ‘modal environments’. The realisation of this potential is dependent on other factors, and further work is required to understand what makes a walking and cycling or a car environment in terms of <b>multi?modal</b> mobility <b>networks.</b> Furthermore, it was found that topological centrality measures show a hierarchy in the <b>multi?modal</b> <b>network</b> infrastructure, and that one should use different methods to analyse the different modes because they play different roles.

In third step, distances between nodes are determined and multiplied by the corresponding transportation cost; sum of the results gives total cost for each link. Finally, total demand for each DC is calculated and multiplied by link costs. Sum of these costs form the <b>multimodal</b> <b>network</b> transportation cost. Last cost function {{is the cost of}} providing mode changing facilities at multimodal terminals. To have the cost calculated, nodes which mode changes are happened should be identified.
