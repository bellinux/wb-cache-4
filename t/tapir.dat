Creole and Chinese restaurants are common in major cities such as Cayenne, Kourou and Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni. Many indigenous animal species such as caiman and <b>tapir</b> are used in spiced stews.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{living on}} the volcano include the {{mountain}} <b>tapir</b> and spectacled bear, {{both of which are}} designated as threatened. Other animals inhabiting the surrounding region include the rufous-fronted parakeet, bearded helmetcrest, and Herveo plump toad. The volcano is home to 27 species of birds endemic to Colombia, with 14 of these species confined to the region around the volcano. 15 bird species in the area are considered threatened.|$|E
5|$|Due to its remoteness, Sangay hosts a {{significant}} biological community with fauna {{such as the}} mountain <b>tapir,</b> giant otter, Andean cock-of-the-rock and king vulture. Since 1983, its ecological community has been protected {{as part of the}} Sangay National Park. Although climbing the mountain is hampered by its remoteness, poor weather conditions, river flooding, and the danger of falling ejecta, the volcano is regularly climbed, a feat first achieved by Robert T. Moore in 1929.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tapirs</b> have a {{long history}} on the North American continent. Fossils of ancient <b>tapirs</b> in North America can be dated back to 50 million-year-old Eocene rocks on Ellesmere Island, Canada, which was then a {{temperate}} climate. By 13 million years ago, <b>tapirs</b> very much like extant <b>tapirs</b> existed in Southern California.|$|R
50|$|Rare Mountain (Wooly) <b>tapirs</b> are {{featured}} in a new exhibit opened in late 2015. The zoo's <b>tapirs</b> were housed away from the public in 2012 due {{to the construction of}} Encounter Africa. Only two zoos in the United States have mountain <b>tapirs</b> - Los Angeles Zoo and Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. There are only seven <b>tapirs</b> between the two zoos, and Cheyenne Mountain Zoo has the only proven breeding female.|$|R
25|$|In the wild, the <b>tapir's</b> diet {{consists}} of fruit, berries, and leaves, particularly young, tender growth. <b>Tapirs</b> will spend {{many of their}} waking hours foraging along well-worn trails, snouts {{to the ground in}} search of food. Baird's <b>tapirs</b> have been observed to eat around 40kg (85lb) of vegetation in one day.|$|R
5|$|The horse {{adapted to}} survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, {{surviving}} in an ecosystem where other large grazing animals, especially ruminants, could not. Horses and other equids are odd-toed ungulates of the order Perissodactyla, a group of mammals that was dominant during the Tertiary period. In the past, this order contained 14families, but only three—Equidae (the horse and related species), Tapiridae (the <b>tapir),</b> and Rhinocerotidae (the rhinoceroses)—have survived to the present day.|$|E
5|$|Fauna is {{similarly}} distributed, with distinct altitudinal zonation present. The highest altitudes support the endangered mountain <b>tapir</b> (Tapirus pinchaque), cougar (Puma concolor), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), and Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus). Lower down, the spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus), jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), margay (Leopardus wiedii), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), brocket deers (Mazama sp.), vulnerable northern pudú (Pudu mephistophiles), and endangered giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis) {{can all be}} found. Bird species common in the area include the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus), Andean cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola peruvianus), giant hummingbird (Patagona gigas), torrent duck (Merganetta armata), king vulture (Sarcoramphus papa), and swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus).|$|E
5|$|In Siberia, {{the main}} prey species are Manchurian wapiti and wild boar (the two species {{comprising}} nearly 80% of the prey selected) followed by sika deer, moose, roe deer, and musk deer. Asiatic black bears and Ussuri brown bears may also {{fall prey to}} tigers, and they constitute up to 40.7% of the diet of Siberian tigers depending on local conditions and the bear populations. In Sumatra, prey include sambar deer, muntjac, wild boar, Malayan <b>tapir</b> and orangutan. In the former Caspian tiger's range, prey included saiga antelope, camels, Caucasian wisent, yak, and wild horses. Like many predators, tigers are opportunistic and may eat much smaller prey, such as monkeys, peafowl and other ground-based birds, hares, porcupines, and fish.|$|E
5000|$|The 1.5-m-long beast {{was related}} to palaeotheres, and {{suspected}} to be the ancestor of modern <b>tapirs</b> and rhinoceroses. Physically, it would have looked very similar to modern <b>tapirs,</b> although it probably lacked the <b>tapir's</b> characteristic proboscis. Its teeth, however, resembled those of a rhinoceros, supporting the idea of its relationship with that group.|$|R
25|$|<b>Tapirs</b> have brown eyes, {{often with}} a bluish cast to them, which has been {{identified}} as corneal cloudiness, a condition most commonly found in Malayan <b>tapirs.</b> The exact etiology is unknown, but the cloudiness may be caused by excessive exposure to light or by trauma. However, the <b>tapir's</b> sensitive ears and strong sense of smell help to compensate for deficiencies in vision.|$|R
50|$|Newborn {{mountain}} <b>tapirs</b> weigh about 5.4 to 6.2 kg {{and have}} a brown coat with yellowish-white spots and stripes. Like adults, baby mountain <b>tapirs</b> have thick, woolly fur to help keep them warm. Weaning begins at around three months of age. The immature coloration fades after about a year, but the mother continues {{to care for her}} young for around 18 months. Mountain <b>tapirs</b> reach sexual maturity at age three and have lived up to 27 years in captivity.|$|R
5|$|Because {{of their}} large size, {{elephants}} {{have a huge}} impact on their environments and are considered keystone species. Their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands; when they dig for water during drought, they create waterholes that can be used by other animals. They can enlarge waterholes when they bathe and wallow in them. At Mount Elgon, elephants excavate caves that are used by ungulates, hyraxes, bats, birds and insects. Elephants are important seed dispersers; African forest elephants ingest and defecate seeds, with either no effect or a positive effect on germination. The seeds are typically dispersed in large amounts over great distances. In Asian forests, large seeds require giant herbivores like elephants and rhinoceros for transport and dispersal. This ecological niche cannot be filled by the next largest herbivore, the <b>tapir.</b> Because most of the food elephants eat goes undigested, their dung can provide food for other animals, such as dung beetles and monkeys. Elephants can {{have a negative impact on}} ecosystems. At Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda, the overabundance of elephants has threatened several species of small birds that depend on woodlands. Their weight can compact the soil, which causes the rain to run off, leading to erosion.|$|E
25|$|The Malayan <b>tapir</b> (Tapirus indicus), {{also called}} the Asian <b>tapir,</b> is {{the largest of the}} five species of <b>tapir</b> and the only one native to Asia. The {{scientific}} name refers to the East Indies, the species' natural habitat. In the Malay language, the <b>tapir</b> is commonly referred to as cipan, tenuk or badak tampung.|$|E
25|$|Adult tapirs {{are large}} enough to have few natural predators, and the thick skin {{on the backs of}} their necks helps to protect them from threats such as jaguars, crocodiles, anacondas, and tigers. The creatures are also able to run fairly quickly, {{considering}} their size and cumbersome appearance, finding shelter in the thick undergrowth of the forest or in water. Hunting for meat and hides has substantially reduced their numbers and, more recently, habitat loss has resulted in the conservation watch-listing of all four species; both the Brazilian <b>tapir</b> and the Malayan <b>tapir</b> are classified as vulnerable, and the Baird's <b>tapir</b> and the mountain <b>tapir</b> are endangered.|$|E
50|$|Lowland <b>tapirs</b> are {{excellent}} swimmers and divers, but also move quickly on land, even over rugged, mountainous terrain. They {{have a life}} span of approximately 25 to 30 years. In the wild, their main predators are crocodilians (only the black caiman and Orinoco crocodile, the latter of which is critically endangered, are large enough to take these <b>tapirs,</b> as the American crocodile only exists {{in the northern part}} of South America) and large cats, such as the jaguar and cougar, which often attack <b>tapirs</b> at night when they leave the water and sleep on the riverbank. Brazilian <b>tapirs</b> are also attacked by green anacondas. They are known to run to water when scared to take cover.|$|R
5000|$|The first tapirids, such as Heptodon, {{appeared}} in the early Eocene. They appeared very similar to modern forms, but were about half the size, and lack the proboscis. The first true <b>tapirs,</b> {{appeared in}} the Oligocene, and by the Miocene, such genera as Miotapirus were almost indistinguishable to the extant species. It is believed that Asian and American <b>tapirs</b> diverged around 20 to 30 million years ago, and that <b>tapirs</b> migrated from North America and Central America into South America around 3 million years ago, {{as part of the}} Great American Interchange. For much of their history, <b>tapirs</b> were spread across the northern hemisphere, where they became extinct as recently as 10,000 years ago.|$|R
50|$|Perissodactyls are {{the order}} of {{odd-toed}} ungulates, including horses, rhinos, <b>tapirs</b> and other extinct forms. Fossils of Hyrachyus, a primitive perissodactyl also present in Europe and North America with affinities to early <b>tapirs</b> and rhinos, are known from the Eocene of Jamaica.|$|R
25|$|The Malayan <b>tapir,</b> {{the species}} most {{isolated}} geographically {{from the rest}} of the genus, has a significantly smaller number of chromosomes and has been found to share fewer homologies with the three types of American tapirs. A number of conserved autosomes (13 between karyotypes of Baird's <b>tapir</b> and the Brazilian <b>tapir,</b> and 15 between Baird's and the mountain <b>tapir)</b> have also been found in the American species that are not found in the Asian animal. However, geographic proximity is not an absolute predictor of genetic similarity; for instance, G-banded preparations have revealed Malayan, Baird's and Brazilian tapirs have identical X chromosomes, while mountain tapirs are separated by a heterochromatic addition/deletion.|$|E
25|$|The Baird's <b>Tapir</b> Project of Costa Rica is {{the longest}} ongoing <b>tapir</b> project in the world, having started in 1994. It {{involves}} placing radio collars on tapirs in Costa Rica's Corcovado National Park to study their social systems and habitat preferences.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{conservation}} {{projects have been}} started around the world. The <b>Tapir</b> Specialist Group, {{a unit of the}} IUCN Species Survival Commission, strives to conserve biological diversity by stimulating, developing, and executing practical programs to study, save, restore, and manage the four species of <b>tapir</b> and their remaining habitats in Central and South America and Southeast Asia.|$|E

40|$|Functional {{redundancy}} {{has been}} debated largely in ecology and conservation, yet we lack detailed empirical {{studies on the}} roles of functionally similar species in ecosystem function. Large bodied frugivores may disperse similar plant species and have strong impact on plant recruitment in tropical forests. The two largest frugivores in the neotropics, <b>tapirs</b> (Tapirus terrestris) and muriquis (Brachyteles arachnoides) are potential candidates for functional redundancy on seed dispersal effectiveness. Here we provide {{a comparison of the}} quantitative, qualitative and spatial effects on seed dispersal by these megafrugivores in a continuous Brazilian Atlantic forest. We found a low overlap of plant species dispersed by both muriquis and <b>tapirs.</b> A group of 35 muriquis occupied an area of 850 ha and dispersed 5 times more plant species, and 13 times more seeds than 22 <b>tapirs</b> living in the same area. Muriquis dispersed 2. 4 times more seeds in any random position than <b>tapirs.</b> This can be explained mainly because seed deposition by muriquis leaves less empty space than <b>tapirs.</b> However, <b>tapirs</b> are able to disperse larger seeds than muriquis and move them into sites not reached by primates, such as large forest gaps, open areas and fragments nearby. Based on published information we found 302 plant species that are dispersed by {{at least one of these}} megafrugivores in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. Our study showed that both megafrugivores play complementary rather than redundant roles as seed dispersers. Although <b>tapirs</b> disperse fewer seeds and species than muriquis, they disperse larger-seeded species and in places not used by primates. The selective extinction of these megafrugivores will change the spatial seed rain they generate and may have negative effects on the recruitment of several plant species, particularly those with large seeds that have muriquis and <b>tapirs</b> as the last living seed dispersers...|$|R

25|$|Malayan <b>tapirs</b> are {{primarily}} solitary creatures, marking out {{large tracts of}} land as their territory, though these areas usually overlap {{with those of other}} individuals. <b>Tapirs</b> mark out their territories by spraying urine on plants, and they often follow distinct paths, which they have bulldozed through the undergrowth.|$|R
25|$|Although they {{frequently}} live in dryland forests, <b>tapirs</b> {{with access to}} rivers spend {{a good deal of}} time in and underwater, feeding on soft vegetation, taking refuge from predators, and cooling off during hot periods. <b>Tapirs</b> near a water source will swim, sink to the bottom, and walk along the riverbed to feed, and have been known to submerge themselves under water to allow small fish to pick parasites off their bulky bodies. Along with freshwater lounging, <b>tapirs</b> often wallow in mud pits, which also help to keep them cool and free of insects.|$|R
