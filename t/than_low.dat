In the long term; however, {{all types of}} low-carbohydrate and low-fat diets appear equally beneficial. A 2014 review found that the heart disease and diabetes risks associated with different diets appear to be similar. Promotion of the Mediterranean diets among the obese may {{lower the risk of}} heart disease. Decreased intake of sweet drinks is also related to weight-loss. Success rates of long-term weight loss maintenance with lifestyle changes are low, ranging from 2–20%. Dietary and lifestyle changes are effective in limiting excessive weight gain in pregnancy and improve outcomes for both the mother and the child. Intensive behavioral counseling is recommended in those who are both obese and have other risk factors for heart disease.|$|E

25|$|Globally, {{high and}} middle income {{countries}} experience lower maternal deaths <b>than</b> <b>low</b> income countries. The Human Development Index (HDI) accounts for between 82 and 85 percent of the maternal mortality rates among countries. In most cases, high rates of maternal deaths occur in the same countries that have high rates of infant mortality. These trends are a reflection that higher income countries have stronger healthcare infrastructure, medical and healthcare personnel, use more advanced medical technologies and have fewer barriers to accessing care <b>than</b> <b>low</b> income countries. Therefore, in low income countries, {{the most common cause}} of maternal death is obstetrical hemorrhage, followed by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, in contrast to high income countries, for which the most common cause is thromboembolism.|$|E

25|$|The Hekla {{area was}} once forested. Forest and some grasses {{are much more}} {{resilient}} to ash and pumice fall <b>than</b> <b>low</b> vegetation, but the combined effect of human habitation and the volcanic activity has left an unstable surface very susceptible to erosion. Hekluskógar, a 90,000ha reforesting project is attempting to restore the birch and willow woodland to the slopes of Hekla, starting with soil fertilisation and grass sowing. This would stabilize the large areas of volcanic ash, help to reduce wind erosion of the frost heaved surface, slow drainage rates and hence water erosion, and ultimately increase biodiversity. It is the largest reforestation of its type in Europe. After an eruption, {{almost all of the}} 'safe sites' on new lava flows are colonised by mosses within 20 years expanding to a homogeneous layer up to 20cm thick within 50 years.|$|E
25|$|Because {{intertidal}} organisms endure regular {{periods of}} immersion and emersion, they essentially live both underwater and {{on land and}} must be adapted to a large range of climatic conditions. The intensity of climate stressors varies with relative tide height because organisms living in areas with higher tide heights are emersed for longer periods than those living in areas with lower tide heights. This gradient of climate with tide height leads to patterns of intertidal zonation, with high intertidal species being more adapted to emersion stresses <b>than</b> <b>low</b> intertidal species. These adaptations may be behavioral (i.e. movements or actions), morphological (i.e. characteristics of external body structure), or physiological (i.e. internal functions of cells and organs). In addition, such adaptations generally cost the organism in terms of energy (e.g. to move or to grow certain structures), leading to trade-offs (i.e. spending more energy on deterring predators leaves less energy for other functions like reproduction).|$|E
40|$|In highly hypnotizable {{individuals}} (highs), postural {{control is}} more independent of sensory information <b>than</b> in <b>low</b> hypnotizable subjects (lows). The {{aim of the}} study was to find out whether locomotion is also less affected in highs <b>than</b> in <b>lows</b> by visual suppression and changes in the neck proprioceptive input. Eighteen highs and 20 lows were asked to walk straight ahead, blindfolded, in basal conditions (face forward), during real and imagined right/left head rotation and mental computation. Highs detected deviations from the straight trajectory better <b>than</b> <b>lows.</b> Their walking direction was more straight during basal conditions and less influenced than the lows' one by mental computation and real/imagined rotation of the head. The results confirm highs' lower dependence on sensory inputs, although this cannot be definitely attributed to a better internal representation of space or to higher behavioral automaticity...|$|R

25|$|Calcium, {{as found}} in food such as milk and green vegetables, is often {{recommended}} to protect against dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent decay of a tooth by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel. Streptococcus mutans {{is the leading cause}} of tooth decay. Low concentration fluoride ions act as bacteriostatic therapeutic agent and high concentration fluoride ions are bactericidal. The incorporated fluorine makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and, thus, resistant to decay. Topical fluoride is more highly recommended than systemic intake such as by tablets or drops to protect the surface of the teeth. This may include a fluoride toothpaste or mouthwash or varnish. Standard fluoride toothpaste (1,000–1,500 ppm) is more effective <b>than</b> <b>low</b> fluoride toothpaste (< 600ppm) to prevent dental caries. After brushing with fluoride toothpaste, rinsing should be avoided and the excess spat out. Many dental professionals include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine visits and recommend the use of xylitol and amorphous calcium phosphate products. Silver diamine fluoride may work better than fluoride varnish to prevent cavities. Water fluoridation also lowers the risk of tooth decay.|$|E
25|$|As for the {{required}} vocal {{range of the}} title role, it is an extraordinary case: The highest note is the high B5, not irregular for a soprano or mezzo-soprano to sing, while the lowest note is a low G3, in the contralto range and officially below the standard range for a mezzo-soprano. Considering this range, {{which is similar to}} many mezzo roles (such as Carmen and Amneris), one might assume that a high soprano is not essential to the piece, but it is; most of the relatively low sopranos who attempted this role found themselves straining their voices throughout the opera, and having reached the closing scene (the {{most important part of the}} opera for the title role) were very fatigued. This role is the classic example of the difference between tessitura and absolute vocal range: While mezzos can perform a high note (like Carmen), or even temporarily sustain a high tessitura, it is impossible for a singer to spend such a long time (with the needed strength and breath-control) in the second octave above the middle C unless she is a high soprano. Moreover, the low G occurs twice in the opera, and in both cases it is in pianissimo—more of a theatrical effect than music—and can be growled instead of sung. The other low notes required are no lower <b>than</b> <b>low</b> A, and they are also quiet.|$|E

500|$|The branch-line coupler {{consists}} of two parallel transmission lines physically coupled together with two or more branch lines between them. [...] The branch lines are spaced λ/4 apart and represent sections of a multi-section filter design {{in the same way}} as the multiple sections of a coupled line coupler except that here the coupling of each section is controlled with the impedance of the branch lines. [...] The main and coupled line are [...] of the system impedance. [...] The more sections there are in the coupler, the higher is the ratio of impedances of the branch lines. [...] High impedance lines have narrow tracks and this usually limits the design to three sections in planar formats due to manufacturing limitations. [...] A similar limitation applies for coupling factors looser <b>than</b> <b>low</b> coupling also requires narrow tracks.
