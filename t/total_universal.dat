50|$|The reason, {{as stated}} in Akilam for the {{disintegration}} of the entire system is that, towards the end of Dwapara Yuga, there in Mount Kailash, Siva believing the words of devas, created Kaliyan without discussing to Vishnu, who had the responsibility to destroy Kaliyan as per previous deeds. So Vishnu refused to take birth in the world to destroy Kaliyan. So Siva and Brahma surrendered all their powers to Vishnu. Until this event, Siva was the supreme power as per Akilam. It is notable that this is a theological idea something similar to Shaivism, where Siva is supreme to all. Then onwards, however, Vishnu is the supreme power. Here the ideology changes similar to that of Vaishnavism. This supremacy of Vishnu remains like this from the beginning of Kali Yuga until the incarnation of Vaikundar, from where it changes further.During the incarnation, Vishnu himself can not incarnate directly in the world to destroy Kaliyan, since he (Kaliyan) had bought as boon the power of Devas, including Vishnu's, and spread it all over the world as maya. So God needs to be incarnated with a new set of rules and with unique importance. A <b>total</b> <b>universal</b> transformation of the power relation of god-heads, the rules of scriptures, the dharma, etc., took place, and Vaikundar was given birth by taking in the power of Ekam, by Lakshmi and Vishnu conjoining together inside the sea.|$|E

In benchmarking studies using a titration of mouse <b>universal</b> <b>total</b> RNA, BIIB outperformed commercially available kits in terms of sensitivity, accuracy, and amplified target length, while providing equivalent results for technical reproducibility. BIIB maintained 50 and 44 % present calls from 100 and 50  pg of total RNA, respectively. Inter- and intrasample precision studies indicated that BIIB produces an unbiased and complete expression profile within a range of 5  ng to 50  pg of starting total RNA. From a panel of spiked exogenous transcripts, we established the BIIB linear detection limit to be 20 absolute copies. Additionally, we demonstrate that BIIB is sensitive enough to detect the stochastic events inherent in a highly diluted sample. Using RNA isolated from whole tissues, we further validated BIIB accuracy and precision by comparison of 224 expression ratios generated by quantitative real-time PCR. The utility of our method is ultimately illustrated by the detection of biologically expected trends in a T cell/B cell titration of 100 primary cells flow sorted from a healthy mouse spleen...|$|R

40|$|Summary Unlike {{maternal}} inheritance in sexual hybridiza-tion, plant somatic hybridization allows transfer, mixing and recombination of cytoplasmic genomes. In {{addition to the}} use of somatic hybridization in plant breeding programs, applica-tion of this unique tool should lead {{to a better understanding of}} the roles played by the chloroplastic and mitochondrial genomes in determining agronomically important traits. The nucleotide sequences of cytoplasmic genomes are much more conserved than those of nuclear genomes. Cytoplasmic DNA composition in somatic hybrids is commonly elucidated either by length polymorphism analysis of restricted genome regions amplified with universal primers (PCR-RF) or by hybridiza-tion of <b>total</b> DNA using <b>universal</b> cytoplasmic probes. In this study, we demonstrate that single-stranded conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis is a powerful, quick and easy alternative method for cytoplasmic DNA characterization of somatic hybrids, especially for mitochondrial DNA.

Twenty-two species of the subfamily Aurantioideae were analyzed with eight universal primers (four from chloroplastic and four from mitochondrial regions). Differences in chloroplastic DNA composition were scored in 98 % of all possible two-parent combinations, and dif-ferent mitochondrial DNA profiles were found in 87 % of them.

Human muscle and liver contain homotetramers M 4 and L 4, respectively, whereas erythrocytes contain {{a mixture of}} M 4, M 3 L, M 2 L 2, ML 3, and L 4 isozymes. Homozygous deficiency of the M subunit in man results in glycogen storage disease (GSD) type VII, which is characterized by exertional muscle weakness and compensated hemolysis; the residual erythrocyte PFK consists of isolated L 4 isozyme. Recently, PFK deficiency associated with isolated hemolytic anemia has been identified among English springer spaniel dogs. We investigated the genetic control of the dog PFK system {{and the nature of}} the enzymatic defect in two PFK-deficient animals, using chromatographic and immunological techniques. Our studies indicate the existence of a trilocus isozyme system for the dog, as is the case with other mammals. Muscle PFK consists of M 4 isozyme, whereas the predominant species of liver and platelet consists, respectively, of the L 4 and P 4 isozyme; erythrocyte PFK consists of a three- or four-membered set composed of M and P subunits. PFK deficiency in the dogs was found to result from a <b>total</b> and <b>universal</b> lack of the M subunit, as is the case in man. However, the probands consistently exhibited L 4 isozyme in their muscle; P 4, L 4, and hybrids thereof in their erythrocytes; and an increase in the L-containing isozymes in their platelets, indicating a generalized anomalous presence of the L subunit. The apparent absence of muscle disease in these animals is most likely accounted for by both the well-known high oxidative potential of the canine muscle in general and the presence of liver PFK in the M-deficient muscle in particular. In contrast, presence of hemolysis despite residual P 4 and hybrids of P and L in the erythrocytes may be inferred to result in severe glycolytic handicap under existing intraerythrocytic conditions...|$|R

Evaluation of Cesaric 2 ̆ 7 s poetry has not dared to go beyond its two surface, but widely acknowledged features: the interchange of suffering and light in human life and the harmony of content and form in Cesaric 2 ̆ 7 s poems. Contrary to this superficial assessment, Cesaric 2 ̆ 7 s poetry includes a striking, deep, consistent and complete life doctrine which is in its entirety the reflection of the genuine Christian attitude to life. Without being aware of it, Cesaric lived an inner life, human and mystical at the same time, which was an emulation of the life of Jesus. Cesaric 2 ̆ 7 s poems disclose that he successively tried to find accommodation with the four 2 ̆ 7 natural 2 ̆ 7 ideological options into which rapid social change has divided people. Unable and unwilling to make permanent compromises with the four ideologies offered (a local Christian tradition, nationalism, socialism, social escapism), Cesaric retreated to a position based in his own rich deposit of love. Deprived of the <b>total</b> and <b>universal</b> exchange of life, usually called love, he forced himself to become satisfied only with bringing life, love and light into the hearts of unknown but numerous readers and admirers. Cesaric 2 ̆ 7 s failure to recognize in Jesus the model for his own use of his life ought to be of great concern to the officials and chartered guardians of Jesus 2 ̆ 7 heritage, a heritage which has not been expressed in terms understandable to contemporary men. The acceptance and real appreciation of Cesaric 2 ̆ 7 s poetry by masses of readers bring the hope that a global society, for which the economic and technological foundations have already been laid, is ready and willing to receive and accept Jesus 2 ̆ 7 message when it is properly worded...|$|R
40|$|The {{childhood}} sarcomas are malignant tumors {{with high}} mortality rates. They {{are divided into}} two genetic categories: a category without distinct pattern karyotypic changes and the other category showing unique translocations that originate gene rearrangements. This category includes rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and synovial sarcoma (SS). Diverse studies have related development genes, such as; IGF 2, IHH, PTCH 1 and all and sarcomatogenesis. Objective: To characterize the RMS, ES and SS rearrangements, we quantify the expression of IGF 2 IHH, PTCH 1 and GUT genes and correlate molecular data with clinical parameters of patients. Design: We analyzed 29 RMS, 10 SS and 60 ES tumor samples by RT-PCR (polymerase chain reaction-reverse transcription) and qPCR (quantitative PCR). Results: Among the samples of ARMS, 50 % had rearrangements of PAX 3 / 7 -FOXO 1, 60 % of ES samples were EWS-FLI 1 positive and 90 % of SS samples were positive for SS 18 -SSX 1 / 2. {{in relation to the}} control reference samples (QPCR Human Reference Total RNA-Stratagene, Human Skeletal Muscle <b>Total</b> RNA-Ambion, <b>Universal</b> RNA Human Normal Tissues-Ambion), RMS samples showed a high IGF 2 gene expression (p < 0. 0001). Moreover, ES samples showed a low IGF 2 gene expression (p < 0. 0001) and high IHH (p < 0. 0001), PTCH 1 (p = 0. 0173) and GM (p = 0. 0113) gene expressions. Conclusions: the molecular characterization of IGF and Hedgehog pathway in these pediatric sarcomas may collaborate to enable {{a better understanding of the}} biological behavior of these neoplasms.

40|$|Background and Methods: To guide {{achievement}} of the Millennium Development Goals, we used the Lives Saved Tool to provide a novel simulation of potential maternal, fetal, and newborn lives and costs saved by scaling up midwifery and obstetrics services, including family planning, in 58 low- and middle-income countries. Typical midwifery and obstetrics interventions were scaled to either 60 % of the national population (modest coverage) or 99 % (universal coverage). Findings: Under even a modest scale-up, midwifery services including family planning reduce maternal, fetal, and neonatal deaths by 34 %. Increasing midwifery alone or integrated with obstetrics is more cost-effective than scaling up obstetrics alone; when family planning was included, the midwifery model was almost twice as cost-effective as the obstetrics model, at $ 2, 200 versus $ 4, 200 per death averted. The most effective strategy was the most comprehensive: increasing midwives, obstetricians, and family planning could prevent 69 % of <b>total</b> deaths under <b>universal</b> scale-up, yielding a cost per death prevented of just $ 2, 100. Within this analysis, the interventions which midwifery and obstetrics are poised to deliver most effectively are different, with midwifery benefits delivered across the continuum of pre-pregnancy, prenatal, labor and delivery, and postpartum-postnatal care, and obstetrics benefits focused mostly on delivery. Including family planning within each scope of practice {{reduced the number of}} likely births, and thus deaths, and increased the cost-effectiveness of the entire package (e. g., a 52 % reduction in deaths with midwifery and obstetrics increased to 69 % when family plannin...|$|R
40|$|Banana bunchy top disease (BBTD) can {{be caused}} by the {{infection}} of two different viruses, Banana bunchy top virus (BBTV) or Abaca bunchy top virus (ABTV). Both viruses can be transmitted persistently by aphid Pentalonia nigronervosa Coq. The research was conducted to detect and to differentiate the virus bypolymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCRRFLP) techniques. Infected plants were collected from Yogyakarta (Sleman, Yogyakarta city, Bantul, Gunung Kidul, and KulonProgo). Nucleon Phytopure DNA Extraction Kit method was used to extract the total DNA of infected plants. Universal primers of Common DNA region (S-CRF and S-CRR) and specific primers DNA-R (C 1 -CRF and CI-CRR) were used for PCR amplification. PCR products were analyzed by RFLP technique using the restriction enzyme of DraI. The results reconfirm previous reports that bunchy top disease of banana in Yogyakarta is caused by BBTV. The ABTV was not detected in this present study. Based on the RFLP analysis it was concluded that BBTV collected in this study could be divided into three groups. Group 1 consisted of BBTV isolate from Sleman and Yogyakarta city with two fragments DNA of 400 and 388 bp. Group 2 consisted of isolate BBTV from Kulon Progo and Gunung Kidul with three fragments DNA of 400, 388, and 323 bp. Group 3 consisted of isolate from Bantul with two fragments DNA of 723 and 376 bp. Further study on the complete characteristics of these groups is still needed.   Penyakit kerdil pisang dapat disebabkan oleh infeksi virus yang berbeda yaitu Banana bunchy top virus(BBTV)  atau Abaca bunchy top virus (ABTV). Kedua virus tersebut ditularkan secara persisten oleh kutu daun Pentalonia nigronervosa Coq. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mendeteksi dan membedakan virus dengan polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Tanaman terinfeksi dikoleksi dari Yogyakarta (Sleman,Kota Yogyakarta, Bantul, Gunung Kidul, dan Kulon Progo). Metode Phytopure DNA Extraction Kit dan CTAB digunakan untuk mengisolasi DNA <b>total.</b> Primer <b>universal</b> Common DNA region (S-CRF/S-CRR) dan primer spesifik DNA-R BBTV(C 1 -CRF danCI-CRR) digunakan dalam amplifikasi dengan PCR. Produk PCRBBTV dianalisis dengan teknik RFLP menggunakan enzim restriksi Dra I. Hasil penelitian memperkuat laporan sebelumnya bahwa penyakit kerdil pisang di Yogyakarta disebabkan oleh BBTV, dan belum ditemukan ABTV. Berdasarkan analisis RFLP, BBTV dapat dibedakan menjadi tiga kelompok. Kelompok 1 yaitu BBTV isolat Sleman dan Kota Yogyakarta dengan dua fragmen DNA berukuran sekitar 400 dan 388 bp.

40|$|Critical {{issues in}} {{prostate}} cancer (PC) are a. identification of molecular drivers {{of the highly}} aggressive neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in adenocarcinoma, and b. early assessment of disease progression. The SRY (sex determining region Y) -box 2 gene, SOX 2, is an essential embryonic stem cell gene involved in prostate tumorigenesis. Here we assessed its implications in NED and progression of PC and its diagnostic and prognostic value. Laser microdissection, qRT-PCR, quantitative Methylation-Specific PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze SOX 2 gene expression and regulation in 206 PC samples. Results were examined according to the patient's clinical pathological profile and follow-ups. Functional studies were performed using PC cells transfected to overexpress or silence SOX 2. SOX 2 was consistently downregulated in PC, except in cell clusters lying within lymph node (LN) -positive PC. Multivariate analysis revealed that SOX 2 mRNA expression in the primary tumor {{was significantly associated with}} LN metastasis. When SOX 2 mRNA levels were ≥ 1. 00, relative to (XpressRef) <b>Universal</b> <b>Total</b> RNA, adjusted Odds Ratio was 24. 4 (95 % CI: 7. 54 - 79. 0), sensitivity 0. 81 (95 % CI: 0. 61 - 0. 93) and specificity 0. 87 (95 % CI: 0. 81 - 0. 91). Patients experiencing biochemical recurrence had high median levels of SOX 2 mRNA. In both PC and LN metastasis, SOX 2 and NED marker, Chromogranin-A, were primarily co-expressed. In PC cells, NED genes were upregulated by SOX 2 overexpression and downregulated by its silencing, which also abolished SNAI 2 /Slug dependent NED. Moreover, SOX 2 upregulated neural CAMs, neurotrophins/neurotrophin receptors, pluripotency and epithelial-mesenchimal transition transcription factors, growth, angiogenic and lymphangiogenic factors, and promoted PC cell invasiveness and motility. This study discloses novel SOX 2 target genes driving NED and spread of PC and proposes SOX 2 as a functional biomarker of LN metastasization for PC...|$|R
