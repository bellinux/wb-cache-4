The team was taken on a parade through the streets wearing white-trimmed hats with blue ribbons given to them for the occasion.

25|$|Next, {{a girl of}} twenty-one {{lay dying}} on a stretcher. The father, a big, gentle Boer {{kneeling}} beside her; while, next tent, his wife was watching a child of six, also dying, and one of about five drooping. Already this couple had lost three children {{in the hospital and}} so would not let these go, though I begged hard <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the hot tent. I can't describe what it is to see these children lying about in a state of collapse. It’s just exactly like faded flowers thrown away. And one has to stand and look on at such misery, {{and be able to do}} almost nothing.|$|E
25|$|While the U.S. {{government}} is {{considering whether to}} kill an American abroad suspected of planning terrorist attacks {{and how to do}} so legally under new stricter targeting policy issued in 2013, The Intercept reported that the U.S. {{government is}} using primarily NSA surveillance to target people for drone strikes overseas. In its report The Intercept the author details the flawed methods which are used to locate targets for lethal drone strikes, resulting in the deaths of innocent people. According to the Washington Post NSA analysts and collectors i.e. NSA personnel who control electronic surveillance equipment use the NSA's sophisticated surveillance capabilities to track individual targets geographically and in real time, while drones and tactical units aimed their weaponry against those targets <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

Laszlo Csaba transformed Dunajská Streda into a winning team managed <b>to</b> <b>took</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the relegation zone. In an incredible come back, Dunajská Streda missed narrowly a place to the Europa League. László Csaba guided his team to a successful breaking-record of 16 games unbeaten which is a new record in the Slovakian football league history.|$|R

25|$|The {{player can}} direct Drake to take cover behind corners or low walls using either aimed or blind-fire {{to kill his}} enemies. The player can also have Drake fire while moving. If Drake is undetected by his enemies, the player can attempt to use stealth <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>out,</b> such as by sneaking up behind them and killing them with one hit, or by {{dropping}} down onto an enemy whilst Drake is hanging from a ledge. The stealth mechanic has been simplified and improved. Some areas of the game will require the player to solve puzzles {{with the use of}} Drake's journal, which provides clues towards the puzzles' solutions. When enabled, a hint system provides gameplay clues, such as the direction of the next objective.|$|E
25|$|The story flashes back {{three months}} to Ramat, a kingdom in the Middle East, where a {{revolution}} {{is about to take}} place. Prince Ali Yusuf gives a fortune in jewels into the safekeeping of Bob Rawlinson, his pilot and the only person he trusts <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the country. Rawlinson conceals the jewels in the luggage of his sister, Mrs Joan Sutcliffe, travelling with her daughter, Jennifer. He is seen doing this by a rather sinister woman via a handheld mirror on her balcony in the next room. Soon after, both Ali Yusuf and Bob Rawlinson are killed in an aeroplane crash after a flight mechanic sabotages their plane. British Intelligence among others get onto the trail of the jewels. Their attention focuses on Meadowbank School, where not only Jennifer, but also the prince's cousin, Shaista, are studying.|$|E

Batting first, Gloucestershire were bowled out for 182 in only 44.1 overs, Matt Windows top-scoring with 57 while Darren Gough and Grant Flower took three wickets each. Malinga Bandara and Martyn Ball shared the highest partnership of the match, adding 59 runs for the ninth wicket to carry Gloucestershire from 118 for 8. Essex then crawled to 49 for 7, James Averis finishing with amazing figures of 8-2-9-2, while Ball and Mark Alleyne also grabbed two wickets each. Despite 46 from New Zealand all-rounder Andre Adams, Essex were all out for 122 when Adams was caught off the bowling of Mark Hardinges.|$|E

25|$|Uncharted 2 is an action-adventure {{platform}} {{video game}} played from a third-person view, with the player {{in control of}} Nathan Drake. Drake is physically adept {{and is able to}} jump, climb, and scale narrow ledges and wall-faces to get between points. Drake can be equipped with up to two firearms – one single-handed and one two-handed – and a limited supply of grenades. Drake can pick up weapons, automatically replacing the existing weapon he was using, and additional ammunition from slain enemies. The player can direct Drake to take cover behind corners or low walls using either aimed or blind-fire to kill his enemies. The player can also have Drake fire while moving. If Drake is undetected by his enemies, the player can attempt to use stealth <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>out,</b> such as by sneaking up behind them to knock them out with one hit, or by pulling an unsuspecting foe over a ledge from which Drake is hanging. In most areas, if all of the foes patrolling are killed stealthily then other waves that would normally appear do not. Some areas of the game require the player to solve puzzles with the use of Drake's journal, which provides clues towards the puzzles' solutions. When enabled, a hint system provides gameplay clues, such as the direction of the next objective.|$|E
25|$|Merida and Belle later stumble upon a witch's home, {{where they}} sneak inside {{to use a}} {{cauldron}} to do a locator spell, which conjures up a futuristic vision of a Southern moor where three men are vying for Merida's hand in marriage, followed by her three brothers brought in by their captors who remove the bags off their heads. Unfortunately, the United Clans also plan to kills Merida's brothers and take DunBroch from Merida. Belle tells Merida its time to change fate, so Belle reads the scroll. As Belle watches Merida practices her archery skills, she's just finished up creating the potion, which will turn Merida into a bear so she can save her brothers. Belle is skeptical about using the spell to change fate, but Merida says otherwise. As they reach the United Clans, Merida threatens <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> but as she drinks the potion, Belle told her it wasn't the actual potion, then tells Merida {{that she should have}} faith in her own fate without magic. When the United Clans' archers aim their arrows at her brothers, Merida showed them who was in charge by aiming her arrows at the targets and takes them out. The clans then bow down to Merida to acknowledge her as the Queen of DunBroch. With that out of the way, Merida let Belle return to Camelot to join the others.|$|E

When Amelia learns of Susan's injury, she is forced {{to take care of}} the children longer than planned and becomes worried that she will miss her son's wedding. Unable to secure any other help to care for them, she calls Richard for advice, who tells her that she has to stay with the children. Without his permission, Amelia decides to take the children with her to the wedding in a rural community near Tijuana, Mexico. Her nephew Santiago (Gael García Bernal) offers to take her and the kids to the wedding. They cross the border uneventfully and the children are soon confronted by the Mexican culture and street scene. The revelry of the wedding extends well into the evening, and the kids enjoy themselves in the festivities. Rather than staying the night in Mexico with the children, Amelia decides to drive back to the States with Santiago. He has been drinking heavily and the border guards become suspicious of him and the American children in the car. Amelia has passports for all four travelers, but no letter of consent from the children's parents allowing her <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of the United States. Intoxicated and worried, Santiago trespasses the border. He soon abandons Amelia and the children in the desert, attempting to lead off the police; his fate after this is unknown.|$|E

After first being told not to study at the table by Lois, Brian notices that Chris's history textbook is hopelessly out of date. Upset by this, Lois goes to a PTA meeting to complain about the textbook. Responding to her grievances, Principal Shepherd explains that the school cannot afford new textbooks due to the school's loss of federal funding under the No Child Left Behind Act {{as a result of their}} low test scores. Forced to make a decision on how to improve the scores and the school's overall performance, Principal Shepherd decides to expel the school's [...] "dumbest" [...] student, who is revealed to be Chris Griffin.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} {{to the threat of}} communist Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 jet fighters, No.77 Squadron was withdrawn to Iwakuni in April 1951, to re-equip with Gloster Meteors. Four Royal Air Force officers with Meteor experience were seconded to No.91 Wing to assist with training. The squadron returned to action with its new aircraft on 29July, operating out of Kimpo, South Korea. The Mustangs had been highly effective in close support, but No.77 Squadron's main role in the RAAF was interception, and it was expected that with the Meteor it could again focus on fighter duties. According to the official history of Australia in the Korean War, the unit proved its value diplomatically as well as operationally: having been one of the first UN squadrons to go into action, it comprised one-third of the jet fighter force {{in the latter part of}} 1951, when clashes in [...] "MiG Alley" [...] were at their height. However, dogfights between Meteors and MiGs that August convinced the new commanding officer, Wing Commander Gordon Steege, that the Australian jets were outmatched, and Fifth Air Force agreed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>out</b> of an offensive air-to-air combat role in favour of escort duties and local air defence. The squadron's loss rate by the end of the year was one in four killed or captured.|$|E

2500|$|The PIT {{maneuver}} {{was adapted}} from the bump and run technique used in stock car racing, where drivers would bump a competitor <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>them</b> <b>out,</b> giving rise to the term, [...] "takeout". [...] This maneuver is illegal in stock car racing because it is very dangerous. [...] The high speed involved in auto racing makes it much easier for drivers to take out another car with a less substantial bump than at lower speeds. [...] When employing the PIT maneuver, {{the speed of the}} two cars involved will determine how far the car will travel once it is bumped. [...] Partially for this reason, the higher the speed, the more unpredictable and dangerous the PIT maneuver becomes. [...] This {{is just one of the}} very important factors a police officer must consider before implementing the PIT maneuver. A police officer is trained to wait until conditions are right before attempting a PIT maneuver to avoid the use of deadly force. [...] Speeds must be lower and the [...] "landing site" [...] for the bumped vehicle must be clear of danger.|$|E
