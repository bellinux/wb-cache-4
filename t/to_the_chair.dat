5|$|After {{his return}} from the second {{expedition}} to Egypt, Champollion was appointed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> of Egyptian history and archaeology at the Collège de France, a chair which had been specially created for him by a decree of Louis Philippe I dated to the 12th of March 1831.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, aged 57, Thompson was {{appointed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chair</b> of Natural History at St Andrews University, remaining {{there for the}} last 31 years of his life. In 1918 he delivered the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on The Fish of the Sea.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{appointment}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chair</b> of Electrical Engineering at Manchester University, Williams recruited his TRE colleague Tom Kilburn on secondment. By {{the autumn of}} 1947 the pair had increased the storage capacity of the Williams tube from one bit to 2,048, arranged in a 64 by 32-bit array, and demonstrated that {{it was able to}} store those bits for four hours. Engineer Geoff Tootill joined the team on loan from TRE in September 1947, and remained on secondment until April 1949.|$|E

60|$|Paul saw {{drops of}} sweat fall from his father's brow. Six {{men were in}} the room--six coatless men, with yielding, {{struggling}} limbs, filling the room and knocking against the furniture.

5|$|In 1589, he was {{appointed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> of mathematics in Pisa. In 1591, his father died, and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother Michelagnolo. In 1592, {{he moved to the}} University of Padua where he taught geometry, mechanics, and astronomy until 1610. During this period, Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental science (for example, kinematics of motion and astronomy) as well as practical applied science (for example, strength of materials and pioneering the telescope). His multiple interests included the study of astrology, which at the time was a discipline tied to the studies of mathematics and astronomy.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, Woodruff was {{appointed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chair</b> of Surgical Science at the University of Edinburgh without requiring an interview. At the university, he split his time equally between his clinical and teaching responsibilities and his research. He was also allowed to appoint two assistant researchers {{who went on}} to become prominent in their own right, Donald Michie and James Howard. As a major part of his research, Woodruff served as the honorary director of a Research Group on Transplantation established by the Medical Research Council.|$|E
5|$|Max Newman {{had been}} {{appointed}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chair</b> of Pure Mathematics at Manchester University in 1945. During the Second World War he {{had worked as a}} cryptanalyst at Bletchley Park, and had led the team which in 1943 produced the first of the Colossus code-breaking computers. Although Newman played no active {{role in the development of}} the SSEM, or any of the subsequent Manchester computers, he was generally supportive and enthusiastic about the project, and arranged for the acquisition of war-surplus supplies for its construction, including GPO metal racks from Bletchley.|$|E

5|$|The pig-faced women {{exhibited}} at fairs were not genuine. Showmen would drug a bear into a stupor by feeding it {{large amounts of}} strong beer, and then shave it. Once shaved, the drunken bear would be fitted with padded artificial breasts, and dressed in women's clothing and a wig. Shoes would {{be attached to the}} bear's hind paws, and stuffed gloves to the front paws. The bear would then be placed in a chair with a hole in the back, and securely tied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
5|$|Schnauz escapes police custody {{by killing}} {{an officer and}} then robs the {{pharmacy}} from the opening, taking the passport photo camera, film, {{and an assortment of}} drug-related materials. While investigating the robbery, Scully is rendered unconscious and kidnapped by Schnauz. Mulder heads to the office where Schnauz's father used to work as a dentist, and finds the exam chair missing. Scully awakens bound <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> with Schnauz claiming he's going to kill the howlers in her head. Schnauz takes a photo of himself, the result of which greatly disturb him, then prepares to lobotomize Scully. Mulder, having found a clue in a photo of Scully from the drugstore's photo booth, finds a trailer in a cemetery and realizes it belongs to Schnauz. He manages to break in and shoot Schnauz in the nick of time. Mulder looks at the photo Schnauz took of himself, in which he is lying dead on the floor.|$|E
5|$|Bohr did {{not enjoy}} {{teaching}} medical students. He {{decided to return to}} Manchester, where Rutherford had offered him a job as a reader in place of Darwin, whose tenure had expired. Bohr accepted. He took a leave of absence from the University of Copenhagen, which he started by taking a holiday in Tyrol with his brother Harald and aunt Hanna Adler. There, he visited the University of Göttingen and the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he met Sommerfeld and conducted seminars on the trilogy. The First World War broke out while they were in Tyrol, greatly complicating the trip back to Denmark and Bohr's subsequent voyage with Margrethe to England, where he arrived in October 1914. They stayed until July 1916, by which time he had been appointed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Chair</b> of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, a position created especially for him. His docentship was abolished at the same time, so he still had to teach physics to medical students. New professors were formally introduced to King Christian X, who expressed his delight at meeting such a famous football player.|$|E

50|$|When Sauvage {{first started}} {{competing}} in wheelchair racing, <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> all had four wheels and were similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chairs</b> {{that they used}} off <b>the</b> track. <b>The</b> <b>chairs</b> {{did not have any}} form of steering. The front wheels were smaller than the back wheels, and when at high speed, they were prone to wobbling. By 1997, racing wheelchairs had basically finished undergoing massive changes to improve them.|$|R
5|$|In 1865, after lengthy debates, Canada's {{legislative}} assembly approved confederation by 91 votes to 33. None of the Maritimes, however, had approved the plan. In 1866, Macdonald {{and his colleagues}} financed pro-confederation candidates in the New Brunswick general election, resulting in a pro-confederation assembly. Shortly after the election, Nova Scotia's premier, Charles Tupper, pushed a pro-confederation resolution through that colony's legislature. A final conference, {{to be held in}} London, was needed before the British parliament could formalise the union. Maritime delegates left for London in July 1866, but Macdonald, who was drinking heavily again, did not leave until November, angering the Maritimers. In December 1866, Macdonald both led the London Conference, winning acclaim for his handling of the discussions, and wooed and won his second wife, Agnes Bernard. Bernard was the sister of Macdonald's private secretary, Hewitt Bernard; the couple first met in Quebec in 1860, but Macdonald had seen and admired her as early as 1856. In January 1867, while still in London, he was seriously burned in his hotel room when his candle set fire <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>chair</b> he had fallen asleep in, but Macdonald refused to miss any sessions of the conference. In February, he married Agnes at St George's, Hanover Square. On 8 March, the British North America Act, which would thereafter serve as the major part of Canada's constitution, passed the House of Commons (it had previously passed the House of Lords). Queen Victoria gave the bill Royal Assent on 29 March 1867.|$|E
