5|$|It was {{originally}} intended that the König-class battleships would be powered by {{two sets of}} turbines on the outer shafts, while the center shaft would have utilized a MAN 6-cylinder 2-stroke diesel engine producing 12,000shp at 150rpm. Development of <b>the</b> <b>diesel</b> was protracted, however, and it was later decided that <b>the</b> <b>diesel</b> would be installed only in Grosser Kurfürst and Markgraf. Ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>diesel</b> was never installed {{in any of the}} König-class battleships. They were instead equipped with three sets of Parsons (König and Kronprinz), AEG-Vulcan (Grosser Kurfürst), or Bergmann (Markgraf) turbines driving 3.8m-wide three-bladed screws. Steam was supplied by three oil-fired and 12 coal-fired Schulz-Thornycroft boilers operating at up to 16atmospheres of pressure.|$|E

50|$|Because the {{pantograph}} is not dropped until <b>the</b> <b>diesels</b> {{have been}} started during electric to diesel mode change, and <b>the</b> <b>diesels</b> are not shut off until {{contact with the}} wire has been made by <b>the</b> pantograph in <b>diesel</b> to electric mode change, HEP is maintained when switching modes.

5|$|Prinzregent Luitpold was {{equipped}} with two sets of Parsons turbines on the outer shafts. It was intended that a single 12,000bhp Germania 6-cylinder 2-stroke diesel engine would drive the center shaft. However, <b>the</b> <b>diesel</b> power plant was not ready in time to be installed in Prinzregent Luitpold, so the ship sailed with only two shafts. On trials, Prinzregent Luitpold was approximately one half knot slower than her sisters.|$|E

5|$|The {{graphics}} engine used {{to power the}} game was christened <b>the</b> <b>Diesel</b> Engine. Grin developed this engine for flexibility and scalability, allowing the engine to be easily upgraded with new features. Based on DirectX, this meant the engine could be used across Windows and Xbox platforms. Grin worked closely with NVIDIA to incorporate then new technologies such as pixel and vertex shaders to render complex scenes. Ballistics was marketed by NVIDIA as a flagship title for their new series of GeForce 3 graphics cards. The game came bundled with various versions of the GeForce 3, with distribution of the bundled game handled by Interplay OEM. Later versions of <b>the</b> <b>Diesel</b> Engine would be used in Grin games such as the Windows version of Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter.|$|E
5|$|All {{the ships}} of this class are built using DMR 249A special grade high-tensile steel, {{produced}} by the state-owned Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), and carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) materials. The main machinery is raft mounted, and each gear unit and its associated engines are mounted on a common raft. <b>The</b> <b>diesel</b> engines are license built by Kirloskar under SEMT Pielstick of France. DCNS supplies the noise-suppressing raft-mounted gearbox for CODAD propulsion. Wärtsilä India manufactures the low-vibration diesel alternators to power the on-board electronics.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the route}} east of New Haven is {{electrified}} under Amtrak's 60 Hz traction power system, Shore Line East currently operates entirely with diesel locomotives.

5|$|As {{a result}} of battle damage and casualties, Langsdorff decided to put into Montevideo, where repairs could be {{effected}} and the wounded men could be evacuated from the ship. Most of the hits scored by the British cruisers caused only minor structural and superficial damage but the oil purification plant, which was required to prepare <b>the</b> <b>diesel</b> fuel for the engines, was destroyed. Her desalination plant and galley were also destroyed, which would have increased the difficulty {{of a return to}} Germany. A hit in the bow would also have negatively affected her seaworthiness in the heavy seas of the North Atlantic. Admiral Graf Spee had fired much of her ammunition in the engagement with Harwood's cruisers.|$|E
5|$|During {{trials of}} the first submarines, the {{propulsion}} system {{was found to be}} prone to failure for a variety of reasons. Most failures were attributed to the fifteen-tank diesel fuel system: the tanks were designed to fill with salt water as they were emptied to maintain neutral buoyancy, but water would regularly enter the engines due to a combination of poor design, gravity separation of the fuel and water being insufficient, and operator error resulting from poor training. Problems were also caused by bacterial contamination of <b>the</b> <b>diesel</b> fuel, which, along with the salt water, would cause the fuel pumps to rust and other components to seize. The fuel-related issues were solved by installing coalescers, improving training and operational procedures, and adding biocides to the fuel.|$|E
5|$|Four Class 66 {{units were}} {{ordered by the}} Norwegian State Railways (NSB) in 1939, {{to be used as}} express trains on the then newly or shortly-to-be {{electrified}} Sørland- and Østfold Lines. At the same time, similar Class 88 diesel multiple units were ordered for the non-electrified Bergen- and Dovre Lines. The trains were built by Strømmens Værksted, Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk and Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB). <b>The</b> <b>diesel</b> series was assembled by Strømmen, while Skabo assembled the electric version. NEBB delivered the motors for the units.|$|E

5|$|In 1800 {{the civil}} {{engineers}} William Jessop and John Rennie assisted local engineers {{with plans for}} improvements, the chief of which was for a steam pumping station. This plan was not implemented immediately, but two steam engines fitted with scoop wheels were installed at Pode Hole in 1823. The pumping station was {{the largest in the}} Fens at the time, and remained so for many years. Steam gradually gave way to diesel engines and scoop wheels were replaced by centrifugal pumps, and <b>the</b> <b>diesel</b> engines were then replaced by electric motors. However, the beam engine and scoop wheel at Pinchbeck Marsh, which ran from 1833 to 1952, was not scrapped, and can be visited by the public.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{following}} a 1989 {{failure of the}} submarine cable and problems with <b>the</b> <b>diesel</b> generator, the light was converted to solar power with battery storage. The caretaker stayed in the premises until March 1991, when lease arrangement difficulties and the previous failure of the mains forced the caretaker's withdrawal. It only took until September 1991 for vandals to destroy the keepers' cottages by fire. In 1992 the Australian Construction Services cleared the site and stabilised some of the building elements, and a security fence was installed.|$|E
5|$|Leipzig and Nürnberg {{were the}} {{follow-on}} class {{to the three}} Königsberg-class ships. They were built to a modified design, which included returning the aft turrets to the centerline. Another major change was a new gear system that allowed <b>the</b> <b>diesel</b> and turbine engines to run at the same time, which permitted a lighter propulsion system to reach the same speed of the earlier ships. They were also fitted with bulbous bows to improve their hydrodynamic efficiency. The two cruisers were not identical: Leipzig had a superstructure similar to the Königsbergs, while Nürnberg was built with a much larger structure. Nürnberg was also completed with a much stronger anti-aircraft battery.|$|E
50|$|The railway ceased {{operation}} in 2000 due to maintenance costs. In late 2006, <b>the</b> two <b>diesels</b> and three passenger cars were {{purchased by the}} West Coast Railway Association.

The diesels' colouring was later changed: Yeti, for example, adopted a red livery, and George a purple one. The warning colours also changed several times until around 2004, when all <b>the</b> <b>diesels</b> again received a green livery, with yellow and black warning colours.|$|R
