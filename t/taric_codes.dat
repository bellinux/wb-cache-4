50|$|Introduction of Harmonized System code in 1990s {{has largely}} {{replaced}} the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC), though SITC remains in use for statistical purposes. In drawing up the national tariff, the revenue departments often specifies {{the rate of}} customs duty {{with reference to the}} HS code of the product. In some countries and customs unions, 6-digit HS codes are locally extended to 8 digits or 10 digits for further tariff discrimination: for example the European Union uses its 8-digit CN (Combined Nomenclature) and 10-digit <b>TARIC</b> <b>codes.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>TARIC</b> <b>code</b> (TARif Intégré Communautaire; Integrated Tariff of the European Communities) is {{designed}} to show the various rules applying to specific products when imported into the EU. This includes {{the provisions of the}} harmonised system and the combined nomenclature but also additional provisions specified in Community legislation such as tariff suspensions, tariff quotas and tariff preferences, which exist {{for the majority of the}} Community’s trading partners. In trade with third countries, the 10-digit <b>Taric</b> <b>code</b> must be used in customs and statistical declarations.|$|R
30|$|For Cd and its compounds, various {{restrictions}} {{already exist}} in Annex XVII of REACH (entry 23, e.g., Cd in plastics); however, {{there is no}} entry for Cd in artists’ paints covered by <b>TARIC</b> <b>code</b> (Tarif Intégré de la Communauté) 3213. The pigments used for artists’ paints are PY 35, PO 20, and PR 108 (pigment yellow, pigment orange, and pigment red) and consist of cadmium zinc sulfide CdxZn(1 −x)S (PY 35) and cadmium seleno sulfide CdS(1 −x)Se(x) (PO 20 and PR 108). According to information of CEPE, the European association of paint, printing ink and artists’ colors companies, 39 tons artists’ paints with Cd pigment are sold annually in Europe. The average content of Cd pigments in artists’ paints ranges from 12.1  % in acrylics and some 35  % in oil and water-based paints [17]. Acrylics have the highest market share in terms of quantity with 79  %, followed by oil (14  %), water paints, and gouache (7  %). The Cd quantity in artists’ paints sold in Europe was specified with 6357  kg per annum [17].|$|R
