5|$|A March 2007 {{survey of}} Arab opinion {{conducted}} by Zogby International and the University of Maryland found <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> {{was the most}} disliked leader in the Arab world.|$|E
5|$|On September 19, 2010, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> {{offered to}} accept 100,000 Palestinian {{refugees}} as American citizens if a permanent settlement {{had been reached}} between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.|$|E
5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> {{would have had to}} win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E
50|$|On February 13, 2008, {{an average}} of major polls {{indicated}} <b>that</b> <b>Bush's</b> approval rating stood at 33.3%. The same average showed, for polls issued {{during the period from}} September 5 to 16, 2008, <b>that</b> <b>Bush's</b> approval rating was 31.9%, and his disapproval rating was 64.8%.|$|R
50|$|A December 2003 Style section {{article in}} the Washington Post {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>Bush's</b> salary from Ignite! was $180,000 per year.|$|R
50|$|The {{review by}} Hadley {{was to be}} part of a damage-control effort {{launched}} after former Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV alleged <b>that</b> <b>Bush's</b> claims regarding uranium purchases were not true. After the review was completed, Karl Rove, President Bush's chief political adviser, allegedly cautioned other White House aides <b>that</b> <b>Bush's</b> 2004 re-election prospects would be severely damaged if it was publicly disclosed that he had been personally warned that a key rationale for going to war had been challenged within the administration.|$|R
5|$|After the South Carolina debate, Biden campaigned in California {{to begin}} May 2007 {{attending}} events in San Francisco. Later {{in the month}} after President George W. Bush enacted economic sanctions against Sudan to pressure the government to end the genocide in Darfur, Biden momentarily shifted focus from Iraq to the crisis in Darfur. He released a statement {{on the campaign trail}} that expressed his belief <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> was right to enact the sanctions. However, Biden argued that it was not enough, calling for a No-Fly Zone over the region and a possible commitment of United States forces to the nation.|$|E
5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited {{as a result of the}} Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It has been argued that with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E
5|$|In May 1968, Bush was {{commissioned}} into the Texas Air National Guard. After {{two years of}} active-duty service while training, {{he was assigned to}} Houston, flying Convair F-102s with the 147th Reconnaissance Wing out of the Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base. Critics, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe, have alleged <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> was favorably treated due to his father's political standing {{as a member of the}} House of Representatives, citing his selection as a pilot despite his low pilot aptitude test scores and his irregular attendance. In June 2005, the United States Department of Defense released all the records of Bush's Texas Air National Guard service, which remain in its official archives.|$|E
50|$|Numerous Harken {{officials}} have said over the years <b>that</b> <b>Bush's</b> presence at Spectrum 7 made the failing company more attractive than it would otherwise have been.|$|R
5000|$|He is for {{waging war}} on Islamic totalitarian states, but he {{believes}} <b>that</b> <b>Bush’s</b> [...] "Forward Strategy of Freedom" [...] is altruistic, self-defeating, and in opposition to America’s national self-interest.|$|R
25|$|Released {{military}} {{records show}} <b>that</b> <b>Bush's</b> documented service record through mid-April 1972 (Bush drilled on the 15th and 16th of that month) was without gaps; {{the period in}} question is from May 1972 forward.|$|R
5|$|After the season, {{a number}} of Trojans were named as {{national}} award winners and finalists. Reggie Bush became USC's seventh Heisman Trophy winner with the second largest margin of victory ever. However, after the aforementioned NCAA investigation, USC would return its copy of Bush's Heisman Trophy, considering <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> {{was determined to be}} ineligible to play by the NCAA. On September 14, 2010, Bush announced that he would forfeit the Heisman and return his copy of the trophy. Bush also won the Doak Walker Award. Despite not winning the Maxwell Award, he won two other Player of the Year awards. Leinart, who was voted third in the Heisman Trophy ballot, was named as a finalist for the Davey O'Brien Award and the Maxwell Award, won the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award, and was named by The Sporting News as their Sportsman of the Year. In addition, Pete Carroll was named a finalist for the Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year award, and Jarrett was named a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award, though neither won.|$|E
5|$|When the {{election}} returns were tallied on November 7, Bush had won 29 states, including Florida. The {{closeness of the}} Florida outcome led to a recount. The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in lower courts for a month until eventually reaching the U.S. Supreme Court. On December 9, in the controversial Bush v. Gore ruling, the Court reversed a Florida Supreme Court decision that had ordered a third count, and stopped an ordered statewide hand recount based on {{the argument that the}} use of different standards among Florida's counties violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The machine recount showed <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> had won the Florida vote by a margin of 537 votes out of six million cast. Although he had received 543,895 fewer individual nationwide votes than Gore, Bush won {{the election}}, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266 (Gore's statewide victories had electoral votes tallying 267; however, one of Gore's pledged electors abstained, rendering the official tally at 266). Bush {{was the first person to}} win an American presidential election with fewer popular votes than another candidate since Benjamin Harrison in 1888.|$|E
25|$|It was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> told Strauss <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> had selected Strauss because Strauss {{said that he}} had voted against Bush and intended to do so again.|$|E
5000|$|The {{day after}} the {{commuting}} of Libby's sentence, James Rowley (Bloomberg News) reported <b>that</b> President <b>Bush</b> has not ruled out pardoning Libby {{in the future and}} <b>that</b> <b>Bush's</b> press spokesman, Tony Snow, denied any political motivation in the commutation. Quoting Snow, Rowley added: [...] "'The president is getting pounded on the right because he didn't do a full pardon.' If Bush were 'doing the weather-vane thing' he 'would have done something differently.'" ...|$|R
2500|$|There is some {{evidence}} <b>that</b> <b>Bush's</b> willingness for the United States to act unilaterally came even earlier. The International Journal of Peace Studies 2003 article [...] "The Bush administration's image of Europe: From ambivalence to rigidity" [...] states: ...|$|R
5000|$|A liberal think tank, The Center for Economic and Policy Research, {{says that}} [...] "Social Security is more financially sound {{today than it}} has been {{throughout}} most of its 69-year history" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>Bush's</b> statement should have no credibility.|$|R
25|$|In September 2009, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> would again sing with Anthrax at the October Loud Park '09 Festival in Japan. Soon afterwards, Benante said <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> had rejoined the band. In February 2010, Anthrax performed five shows as part of Soundwave in Australia. After the Australian shows, Bush said the band intended to re-record the vocals of several tracks from the upcoming album.|$|E
25|$|Critics, like John Micklethwait in {{the book}} The Right Nation, claim <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> was deceived by neoconservatives into {{adopting}} their policies.|$|E
25|$|Bush's four {{reasons for}} the {{invasion}} provided sufficient justification to establish bipartisan Congressional approval {{and support for the}} invasion. However, the secrecy before initiation, the speed and success of the invasion itself, and U.S. public support for it (80% public approval) did not allow Democrats to object to Bush's decision to use military force. One contemporary study suggests <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> decided to invade for domestic political reasons, citing scarce strategic reasoning for the U.S. to invade and immediately withdraw without establishing the structure to enforce the interests <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> used to justify the invasion.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "Memex: Getting Back on the Trail", Tim Oren argues <b>that</b> <b>Bush's</b> {{original}} vision {{expressed in}} AWMT describes a [...] "...private device into which public encyclopedias and colleague's trails might be inserted {{to be joined}} with the owner's own work." ...|$|R

50|$|Moore {{moves on}} to examine George W. Bush's Air National Guard service record. Moore contends <b>that</b> <b>Bush's</b> dry-hole oil well {{attempts}} were partially funded by the Saudis and by the bin Laden family through the intermediary of James R. Bath. Moore alleges that these conflicts of interest suggest <b>that</b> the <b>Bush</b> administration does not {{serve the interests of}} Americans. The movie continues by suggesting ulterior motives for the War in Afghanistan, including a natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan to the Indian Ocean.|$|R
25|$|On June 10, 2010, the NCAA found <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> was {{ineligible for}} college {{athletics}} during the 2005 season and USC {{was forced to}} vacate all wins from that year.|$|E
25|$|On January 7, 2009, the New Orleans Saints {{confirmed}} <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> {{had surgery}} on his left knee, and would require months of rehabilitation. However, Bush {{was expected to be}} ready for minicamp in June.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of the campaign, Dukakis fired his deputy field {{director}} Donna Brazile after she spread rumors <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> had an affair with his assistant Jennifer Fitzgerald.

5000|$|Then-President George W. Bush, in a May 2008 {{speech at}} the Knesset, likened direct {{negotiations}} with Iran, or terrorist groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah, to attempts at [...] "appeasement" [...] of Nazi Germany in the late 1930s. The comments were interpreted by some in the media, {{as well as by}} Obama himself, as a direct criticism of Obama. Obama called the comments [...] "a false political attack", and added <b>that</b> [...] "George <b>Bush</b> knows <b>that</b> I have never supported engagement with terrorists," [...] while Senator Joe Biden, Obama's running mate, said <b>that</b> <b>Bush's</b> comments were [...] "demeaning to the presidency of the United States of America". Bush spokeswoman Dana Perino, pressed for a clarification, stated <b>that</b> <b>Bush's</b> comments were [...] "not specifically pointed to one individual," [...] and that [...] "all of you who cover these issues... have known that there are many who have suggested these types of negotiations".|$|R

5000|$|The tone of {{the debate}} between these two {{interest}} groups is merely one example among many of the tone {{of many of the}} debates, discussions, columns, advertisements, articles, letters, and white papers <b>that</b> <b>Bush's</b> proposal, to touch the [...] "third rail", has sparked among politicians, pundits, thinktankers, and taxpayers.|$|R
25|$|Conrad {{was very}} vocal in his {{opposition}} to the spending policies of the George W. Bush administration. He contends <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> worsened the problems of national debt.

25|$|Bush {{returned}} {{from a trip to}} Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan late on April 19, and met with four students and several lawmakers that afternoon.

25|$|Bush took {{no further}} action {{with respect to}} Libby's {{conviction}} or sentence during his presidential term, despite entreaties from conservatives {{that he should be}} pardoned.

5000|$|As {{a public}} intellectual, Vidal criticized what he viewed as {{political}} {{harm to the}} nation and the voiding of the citizen's rights through the passage of the USA Patriot Act (2001) during the George W. Bush administration (2001-2009). He described Bush as [...] "the stupidest man in the United States" [...] and said <b>that</b> <b>Bush's</b> foreign policy was explicitly expansionist. He contended <b>that</b> the <b>Bush</b> Administration and their oil-business sponsors, aimed to control the petroleum of Central Asia, after having gained hegemony over the petroleum of the Persian Gulf in 1991.|$|R
