5|$|Mahavira <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> {{the soul}} exists, a premise that Jainism shares with Hinduism but not Buddhism. According to Buddhism, {{there is no}} soul or self, and its teachings {{are based on the}} concept of anatta. In contrast, Mahavira <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> the soul is {{permanent}} and eternal with respect to dravya (substance). Mahavira additionally <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> the soul is also impermanent with respect to paryaya (modes that originate and vanish).|$|E

5|$|Ahimsa (Non-violence or Non-injury). Mahavira <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> {{every living}} being has {{sanctity}} and dignity {{of its own}} {{and it should be}} respected just as one expects one's own sanctity and dignity to be respected. Ahimsa is formalised into Jain doctrine as the first and foremost vow. The concept applies to action, speech, and thought.|$|E

5|$|Early Reformed theologians such as John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli {{rejected}} the medieval belief in transubstantiation, that {{the bread and}} wine of the Eucharist change into Christ's body and blood, but <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> Christ's person, including his body and blood, are presented to Christians who partake of it in faith. They also disagree with Martin Luther and the Lutheran tradition which <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> Christ's body is physically eaten with the mouth in the sacrament. Later Reformed orthodox theologians continued to teach views {{similar to that of}} Calvin and Zwingli. In the modern period, Karl Barth espoused a symbolic view that the sacrament only communicates God's promises rather than functioning to actually confer these promises. Other Reformed theologians continued to teach the traditional view.|$|E
5|$|Gnostics read John but {{interpreted}} {{it differently}} from the way non-Gnostics did. Gnosticism <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> salvation came from gnosis, secret knowledge, and Gnostics did not see Jesus as a savior but a revealer of knowledge. Barnabas Lindars asserts that the gospel teaches that salvation can only be achieved through revealed wisdom, specifically belief in (literally belief into) Jesus.|$|E

5|$|Historian Carter Lindberg of Boston University {{has drawn}} {{parallels}} between contemporary prosperity {{theology and the}} medieval indulgence trade.

5|$|It {{was founded}} in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC. The Stoics <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> {{emotions}} resulted in errors of judgment which were destructive, due to the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom, {{and the belief that}} it is virtuous to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accord with nature. Because of this, the Stoics presented their philosophy {{as a way of life}} (lex divina), and they thought that the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> everything was rooted in nature.|$|E
5|$|Symeon <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> putting oneself {{under the}} {{guidance}} of a spiritual father was essential for those who were serious about living the spiritual life. That relationship was a historical tradition especially prominent among the Desert Fathers, who defined the qualifications for acting in the role of a spiritual father: personal experience; an interior life; purity of heart; the vision of God; insight; inspiration; discernment. Official ordination as a priest was not a requirement—Symeon's own spiritual father was a simple unordained monk who had many spiritual children. Symeon also <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> such teachers were empowered by their holiness to preach and to absolve others of their sins, a view that brought him into disagreement with church leaders of his time.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the late}} 1950s, the Afro-Dominican culture {{of most of}} the island was {{repressed}} by the colonial government and the influence of the Roman Catholic Church, both of which <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> African-derived music was evil, demonic and uncultured. This perception changed in the mid- to late 20th century, when Afro-Dominican culture came to be celebrated through the work of promoters like Cissie Caudeiron.|$|E
5|$|A {{central theme}} {{throughout}} Symeon's teachings and writings {{is that all}} Christians should aspire to have actual direct experience of God in deep contemplation, or theoria. Regarding his own mystical experiences, he presented them not as unique to himself, but as the norm for all Christians. He <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> the experience came after purification through prayer, repentance, and asceticism. He especially called on his monks {{to take on the}} traditional charismatic and prophetic role in the Church.|$|E
5|$|According to Ehrman, Jesus <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> {{a coming}} kingdom was everyone's proper focus, not {{anything}} in this life. He taught about the Jewish Law, seeking its true meaning, sometimes in opposition to other traditions. Jesus put love {{at the center of}} the Law, and following that Law was an apocalyptic necessity. His ethical teachings called for forgiveness, not judging others, loving enemies, and caring for the poor. Funk and Hoover note that typical of Jesus were paradoxical or surprising turns of phrase, such as advising one, when struck on the cheek, to offer the other cheek to be struck as well (Luke 6:29).|$|E

5|$|After {{he gained}} Kevala Jnana, Mahavira <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> the {{observance}} of the vows ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (chastity), and aparigraha (non-attachment) {{is necessary to}} spiritual liberation. He gave the principle of Anekantavada (many-sided reality), Syadvada and Nayavada. The teachings of Mahavira were compiled by Gautama Swami (his chief disciple) and were called Jain Agamas. These texts were transmitted through oral tradition by Jain monks, but {{are believed to have}} been largely lost by about the 1stcentury when they were first written down. The surviving versions of the Agamas taught by Mahavira are some of the foundational texts of Jainism.|$|E
5|$|During the Reformation, Martin Luther {{rejected}} {{many of the}} Catholic Church's seven sacraments, but retained baptism and the Lord's Supper. He {{saw many}} practices of the medieval church as abuses of power intended to require work in order to merit forgiveness for sin after baptism rather than faith alone. Luther attached the promise of salvation to baptism, and <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> life after baptism should be spent in recollection {{of it and the}} dying to sin it signified.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Schleiermacher, an {{influential}} nineteenth-century Reformed theologian, saw baptism {{as the way}} the church receives new members and <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> faith is a precondition for baptism. He was ambivalent about the practice of infant baptism, teaching {{that it was not}} an essential institution, but could be continued as long as the church was faithful in bringing children to confirmation. Schleiermacher also saw baptism as primarily individual rather than initiating one into a covenant community, and rejected the idea that baptism should be connected with Old Testament circumcision.|$|E

Narendra and Ramakrishna's other disciples took care of him during his last days, and Narendra's spiritual education continued. At Cossipore, he experienced Nirvikalpa samadhi. Narendra and several other disciples received ochre robes from Ramakrishna, forming his first monastic order. He was <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> service to men was the most effective worship of God. Ramakrishna asked him {{to care for the}} other monastic disciples, and in turn asked them to see Narendra as their leader. Ramakrishna died in the early-morning hours of 16 August 1886 in Cossipore.|$|E
5|$|In Smith's view, the {{opportunity}} to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity; those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf. Smith said that children who died in their innocence would be guaranteed to rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation. Apart from those who committed the eternal sin, Smith <b>taught</b> <b>that</b> even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife.|$|E
