2500|$|The role of {{dialectic}} in Plato's {{thought is}} contested {{but there are}} two main interpretations: a type of reasoning and a method of intuition. Simon Blackburn adopts the first, saying that Plato's dialectic is [...] "the process of eliciting the truth by means of questions aimed at opening out what is already implicitly known, or at exposing the contradictions and muddles of an opponent's position." [...] A similar interpretation has been put forth by Louis Hartz, who suggests that elements of the dialectic are borrowed from Hegel. According to this view, opposing arguments improve upon each other, and prevailing opinion is shaped by the synthesis of many conflicting ideas over time. Each new idea exposes a flaw in the accepted model, and the epistemological substance of the debate continually approaches the truth. Hartz's is a <b>teleological</b> <b>interpretation</b> at the core, in which philosophers will ultimately exhaust the available body of knowledge and thus reach [...] "the end of history."

30|$|Of course, {{forecasting}} {{the future}} was nothing new in the 1950 s and {{can be traced back}} in history. In the 18 th century, as the historian Reinhart Koselleck argued, the horizons of expectation were separated from the spaces of experience. <b>Teleological</b> <b>interpretations</b> and Christian expectations of salvation were superseded by notions of an open future and the belief in “worldly” progress. Prophecies were superseded by prognostics. This was crucial for modern temporal consciousness and self-consciousness, for social and political developments, as the “saddle period” (Sattelzeit) opened up the floor to plans and utopias [60 Koselleck]. In the industrial age people came to believe that the study of the natural and social world would help them make progress and “gain some kind of control over the passing of time”. Rationality, science and technology seemed to allow control over nature and enable people to plan and steer the future [45 Hunt, p 25]. The intertwining of technological changes and thoughts about the future might be traced in any historical period [45 Hunt], but was especially noticeable in the decade from the late 1950 s to the late 1960 s.|$|R

After outlining the common characteristics of both states around 1960, it analyses the cultural diplomacy of the post-Stalinist Soviet Union towards Brazil. Transforming its hitherto prevailing image as the cradle of world revolution and communist class struggle, the USSR now represented itself {{as a role model}} for the quick industrialisation of the economy and education of the masses. Many Brazilian intellectuals and political reformers from Presidents Kubitschek to Goulart shared with the Soviets an interest in what is called here Socialist High Modernity. Contacts with the Soviet Union were a chief reason for the putsch and the end of Brazilian democracy in 1964. But the new military leaders also had their own interests in and surprisingly good relations with the stagnating Soviet Union – again based on a set of commonalities in the historical development of the two ostensibly idiosyncratic and distant states {{on either side of the}} Iron Curtain. Eschewing <b>teleological</b> <b>interpretations</b> of the period and exploring the ideational basis of actors in the conflict, this shared history – based on new documents from Moscow archives and recently declassified sources from the Brazilian Foreign Ministry – aims to contribute not only to Cold War historiography, but also to link it to the debates on Global History, which have lately neglected both Latin America and Eastern Europe...|$|R

We identify two main epistemic functions that this ‘teleological obsession’ serves: on-line prediction and social learning. We show how <b>teleological</b> action <b>interpretations</b> can serve these functions by drawing on two kinds of inference (‘action-to-goal’ or ‘goal-to-action’), and argue that both types of teleological inference constitute inverse problems {{that can only be}} solved by further assumptions. We pinpoint the assumptions that the three currently proposed mechanisms of goal attribution (action-effect associations, simulation procedures, and teleological reasoning) imply, and contrast them with the functions they are supposed to fulfil. We argue that while action-effect associations and simulation procedures are generally well suited to serve on-line action monitoring and prediction, social learning of new means actions and artefact functions requires the inferential productivity of teleological reasoning...|$|R

40|$|According {{to recent}} {{theoretical}} proposals, one function of infant goal attribution {{is to support}} early social learning of artifact functions from instrumental actions, and one function of infant sensitivity to communication is to support early acquisition of generic knowledge about enduring, kind-relevant properties of the referents. The current study tested two hypotheses, derived from these proposals, about the conditions that facilitate the acquisition of enduring functions for novel tools during human infancy. Using a violation-of-expectation paradigm, we show that 13. 5 -month-old infants encode arbitrary end states of action sequences {{in relation to the}} novel tools employed to bring them about. These mappings are not formed if the same end states of action sequences cannot be interpreted as action goals. Moreover, the tool–goal mappings acquired from infant-directed communicative demonstrations are more resilient to counterevidence than those acquired from non-infant-directed presentations and, thus, show similarities to generic representations rather than episodic ones. These findings suggest that the acquisition of tool functions during infancy is guided by both <b>teleological</b> action <b>interpretation</b> mechanisms and the expectation that communicative demonstrations reveal enduring dispositional properties of tools...|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{tendency}} of investment tribunals to resort to <b>teleological</b> <b>interpretation</b> and to the protection and promotion of foreign investments as a standard goal of investment treaties. It further explores how this tendency relates {{to the rule of}} interpretation envisaged in Articles 31 – 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties considering that the convention rule requires that text, context, and purpose are to be equally assessed when searching for the meaning of a treaty provision. The article’s particular focus is on whether investment tribunals have begun to create specific rules for interpreting investment treaties that favor one of the elements of interpretation over the others, namely, the purpose of the treaty. This method of <b>teleological</b> <b>interpretation</b> is set against the general background of investment arbitration, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, and cases where investment tribunals’ reliance on the preamble of the applicable treaty was decisive for the final outcome of the case. These cases, which revolved around the goal to protect and promote foreign investments and <b>teleological</b> <b>interpretation,</b> lend support to the proposition {{that there has been a}} departure from the general rule. However, they equally show the unreliability of telos in a treaty: purposes may be different, even conflicting, and their clear meaning can easily escape interpreters. Despite a growing number of cases where the purpose of a treaty comes to the forefront of legal reasoning, the functional correlation between the purpose of a treaty and the legitimacy of a claim still remains unclear...|$|E

It is argued that memoirs are used as a mechanism to uphold an idealised (i. e. powerful) white identity, because whites’ current “destabilised” identity has resulted in them clinging to a seemingly utopian version of both {{what it meant to be}} white and the past. The article also examines some aspects of whiteness studies, utilising Peter McLaren’s framework to argue that these memoirs are beset by a whiteness of social amnesia...|$|R

Further, it is shown that the EFTA Court appears, in hard cases, to lean even further towards <b>teleological</b> (ie integrationist) <b>interpretation</b> than the ECJ. It is suggested that this may be due to to structural imbalances between the two EEA courts, the EFTA Court’s desire to prove its independence from the EFTA States and its quest for recognition from the ECJ...|$|R

In my thesis, I identify and examine the main reasons for implementation of new institutes and other changes into the gaming law. In this context, I assess the degree of restrictiveness or liberality of each regulation while focusing on whether there were any long-term tendencies to make the legislation more or less strict. All of this is done through the interpretation of legal norms with the help of legal methodology - methods of subjectively historical, <b>teleological</b> and logical <b>interpretation</b> are used in the thesis. These forms of legal methodology were chosen with regard to the resources used in the thesis, which include mainly legislation and its explanatory statements.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to define the cathegory of {{peremptory}} rules in private international law and to describe their specific use in the commercial domain compared to business to consumer contractual relations. The reason for my research was my concern for {{the conflict between the}} formal possibility to conclude a contract and the actual enforceability of the contractual claims before a court or before alternative dispute resolution bodies in the domain of private international law. A major part of the thesis uses an analytical approach and a grammatical, <b>teleological</b> and logical <b>interpretation</b> of the mentioned legal instruments. The final part is grounded on the legal comparation of several laws across different countries and thus demonstrating how different approaches to peremtory rules may influence the actual interpetation of various legal relations and the contractual liberty in general. The thesis is composed of four chapters and a conclusion. To begin with, the first chapter focuses on the peremptory rules in international commercial relations as a whole. It aims to define the core notion of the peremptory rules. It also reals with a personal and material scope of the thesis - the particularities of commercial relations.

40|$|First, X and X {{contributes}} to legal uncertainty {{as regards the}} applicability of the Charter to member states for the purposes of Article 51 (1) CFR. The judgment does not conform to the expansive and creative interpretation of Fransson; it contradicts the specific precedent regarding powers derived from EU Regulations established in N. S. and Others; and it does not fit satisfactorily within the Siragusa criteria which the CJEU in any case entirely omitted. Second, the Court, instead of giving an appropriate degree of weight to the formal connection of the visa application to EU law, which was confirmed by the legal practice of the parties to the dispute at national level, the CJEU engaged in a counter-intuitive <b>teleological</b> <b>interpretation</b> that disregarded the textual reading of the statute. Such contra legem failure to give effect to an applicable statute – which merely required the acknowledgement of the applicability of EU law, not the reversal of the visa refusal – is inimical to a conventional functioning of legal systems based on the rule of law, such as the legal order of the EU. Moreover, the <b>teleological</b> <b>interpretation</b> cannot be validated by reference to any of the values that the EU is based upon; nor can it be legitimatized by requirements of the Dublin Regulation establishing the common EU asylum system, as there is no legal hierarchy between that Regulation and the Regulation on the Visa Code. Third and last, the CJEU paid little attention to the potential effects on the unity, primacy and effectiveness of EU law when divergent national standards with respect to visa applications “formally” based on the Visa Code are developed. By going to such great lengths to negate the Visa Code, the EU has effectively created “un-Chartered” territory in EU law. status: publishe...|$|E

By fundamental assumptions, I mean Smith's views on teleology, final causes and divine design. These have been described as the "secret" foundations to Smith's writings. Teleology, final causes and divine design were initially seen as central to understanding Smith's writings. Over time, this view fell out of fashion. In the period after World War II, with the rise of positivism, commentators tended to overlook or downplay the significance of these fundamental assumptions.

40|$|An {{interpretation}} of the metabolic response to injury in patients with severe accidental or surgical trauma is made. In the last century, various authors attributed a meaning to the post-traumatic inflammatory response by using <b>teleological</b> arguments. Their <b>interpretations</b> of this response, not only facilitates integrating the knowledge, but also the flow from the bench to the bedside, which is the main objective of modern translational research. The goal of the current review is to correlate the metabolic changes with the three phenotypes -ischemia-reperfusion, leukocytic and angiogenic- that the patients express during {{the evolution of the}} systemic inflammatory response. The sequence in the expression of multiple metabolic systems that becomes progressively more elaborate and complex in severe injured patients urges for more detailed knowledge in order to establish the most adequate metabolic support according to the evolutive phase. Thus, clinicians must employ different treatment strategies based on the different metabolic phases when caring for this challenging patient population. Perhaps, the best therapeutic option would be to favor early hypometabolism during the ischemia-reperfusion phase, to boost the antienzymatic metabolism and to reduce hypermetabolism during the leukocytic phase through the early administration of enteral nutrition and the modulation of the acute phase response. Lastly, the early epithelial regeneration of the injured organs and tissues by means of an oxidative metabolism would reduce the fibrotic sequelae in these severely injured patients...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} interplay of grammar and context {{in the interpretation of}} modal words like ought, necessary, and need. The empirical foci of the discussion are patterns in the use of strong and weak necessity modals in conversation, and the interpretation of syntactically and semantically versatile modals like need in the various grammatical configurations they appear in across languages. ^ It is argued that a sensitivity to collective commitments in a conversation is necessary for understanding certain aspects of modal strength, in particular the traditional distinction between strong and weak necessity modals (exhibited by must and ought to in English). It is proposed that strong necessity modals can only reference priorities that are presupposed to be collectively committed to, whereas weak necessity modals are evaluated with respect to a mixed bag of priorities, crucially including ones that are presupposed not to be collectively committed to. A domain restriction approach to weak necessity is adopted, following a demonstration that it is superior to a number of probabilistic alternatives. ^ Modal verbs and adjectives that take both infinitival and nominal complements are shown to pattern alike across languages in requiring a <b>teleological,</b> or goal-oriented <b>interpretation</b> when their complements are not infinitives (but rather noun phrases or certain Complementizer Phrases). This limitation is lifted with infinitival complements, showing that transitive configurations of certain intensional verbs are not semantically equivalent to the infinitival configurations of the same verbs. ^ A result of this research is a fine grained analysis of the differences between closely related necessity modals and attitude verbs. ...|$|R

The present study wishes to propose a new approach method of the economic phenomena and processes based on the researches made outside the economic space- a new general interpretation theory- which is centered on the human being as the basic actor of economy. A general interpretation theory must assure the interpretation of the causalities among the economic phenomena and processes- causal interpretation; the interpretation of the correlations and dependencies among indicators- normative interpretation; the interpretation of social and communicational processes in economic organizations- social and communicational interpretation; the interpretation of the community status of companies- transsocial interpretation; the interpretation of the purposes of human activities and their coherency – <b>teleological</b> interpretation; the <b>interpretation</b> of equilibrium/ disequilibrium from inside the economic systems- optimality interpretation. In order to respond to such demands, rigor, pragmatism, praxiology and contextual connectors are required. In order to progress, the economic science must improve its language, both its syntax and its semantics. The clarity of exposure requires a language clarity and the scientific theory progress asks for the need of hypotheses in the building of the theories. The switch from the common language to the symbolic one means the switch from ambiguity to rigor and rationality, that is order in thinking. But order implies structure, which implies formalization. Our paper should be a plea for these requirements, requirements which should be fulfilled by a modern interpretation theory...|$|R
