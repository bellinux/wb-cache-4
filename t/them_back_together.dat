25|$|Although Sumter was a masonry fort, {{there were}} wooden {{buildings}} inside for barracks and officer quarters. The Confederates targeted these with Heated shot (cannonballs heated red hot in a furnace), starting fires {{that could prove}} more dangerous to the men than explosive artillery shells. At 7 p.m. on April 12, a rain shower extinguished the flames {{and at the same}} time the Union gunners stopped firing for the night. They slept fitfully, concerned about a potential infantry assault against the fort. During the darkness, the Confederates reduced their fire to four shots each hour. The following morning, the full bombardment resumed and the Confederates continued firing hot shot against the wooden buildings. By noon most of the wooden buildings in the fort and the main gate were on fire. The flames moved toward the main ammunition magazine, where 300 barrels of gunpowder were stored. The Union soldiers frantically tried to move the barrels to safety, but two-thirds were left when Anderson judged it was too dangerous and ordered the magazine doors closed. He ordered the remaining barrels thrown into the sea, but the tide kept floating <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>together</b> into groups, some of which were ignited by incoming artillery rounds. He also ordered his crews to redouble their efforts at firing, but the Confederates did the same, firing the hot shots almost exclusively. Many of the Confederate soldiers admired the courage and determination of the Yankees. When the fort had to pause its firing, the Confederates often cheered and applauded after the firing resumed and they shouted epithets at some of the nearby Union ships for failing to come to the fort's aid.|$|E

500|$|In {{spite of}} the {{existing}} tradition of a black actor playing Caliban opposite a white Prospero, colonial interpretations of the play did not find their way onto the stage until the 1970s. Performances in England directed by Jonathan Miller and by Clifford Williams explicitly portrayed Prospero as coloniser. Miller's production was described, by David Hirst, as depicting [...] "the tragic and inevitable disintegration of a more primitive culture {{as the result of}} European invasion and colonisation". Miller developed this approach in his 1988 production at the Old Vic in London, starring Max von Sydow as Prospero. This used a mixed cast made up of white actors as the humans and black actors playing the spirits and creatures of the island. According to Michael Billington, [...] "von Sydow's Prospero became a white overlord manipulating a mutinous black Caliban and a collaborative Ariel keenly mimicking the gestures of the island's invaders. The colonial metaphor was pushed through to its logical conclusion so that finally Ariel gathered up the pieces of Prospero's abandoned staff and, watched by awe-struck tribesmen, fitted <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>together</b> to hold his wand of office aloft before an immobilised Caliban. The Tempest suddenly acquired a new political dimension unforeseen by Shakespeare." ...|$|E

500|$|According to lead vocalist Bart Millard, MercyMe {{had started}} as a rock band and had {{wanted to make a}} rock record. Following the success of their {{breakthrough}} single [...] "I Can Only Imagine", a ballad, they were advised to [...] "duplicate [...] on the next two records". Millard says they felt that they were at a point where [...] "we are known more for ballads than the rock band we wanted to be". With the consent of their label, which felt there was a trend towards heavier music, MercyMe decided to make an [...] "edgier" [...] record. In particular the band focused on up-tempo songs, trying to put more edge into what they were making. Millard noted that while the songs are still pop rock songs, the band tried to put a bit more edge into them. Additionally, the band decided to work with producer Brown Bannister, who had produced the group's Christmas record and Millard's solo album Hymned No. 1, as opposed to Pete Kipley, who had produced the band's previous three albums. Bannister's producing style was different from Kipley's; while Kipley was a hands-on producer, [...] "involved in every part of the song", Bannister would wait until the band had [...] "run down all [...] avenues" [...] before giving input. The band felt Bannsiter was an [...] "amazing encourager" [...] and were satisfied with the Christmas album Bannister had produced with him; although they felt Kipley did a great job on their previous records, improving themselves as a band and as songwriters, they felt it was [...] "time for a change". Another factor in the decision to use Bannister was his previous recording experience; Bannister had produced one of Millard's favorite albums, White Heart's 1989 album Freedom. The different approach the band took with Bannister resulted in a sometimes [...] "radical" [...] approach, with the band [...] "taking songs apart, putting <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>together</b> and, at times, totally reinventing them". One song, [...] "Something About You", shifted from [...] "an aggressive rock song to a soaring anthem".|$|E
500|$|Producers {{decided to}} kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died {{off-screen}} {{after having a}} motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick. Nick {{had been involved in}} a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: [...] "We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>together</b> was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [...] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only {{in a state of shock}} and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [...] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change." [...] Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme-makers to change their minds. She comments, [...] "I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past, I have talked things through and I was listened to".|$|E
