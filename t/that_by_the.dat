5|$|As {{with many}} types Asian and African megafauna, the Javan rhino was relentlessly hunted by trophy and big-game hunters for decades {{following}} {{the arrival of}} Europeans in its range. The rhinos being easy targets, this was as severe a contributor to its decline as was poaching for its horns. Such was the toll of big-game hunting <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> time the rhino's plight was made known to the world, only the Javan and the (then unknown) Vietnamese populations remained.|$|E
