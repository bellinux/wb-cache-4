5|$|The Przeworsk culture, {{named after}} a town in Lesser Poland, near which another burial ground was found, {{originated}} like the Oksywie culture around 250 BC, but lasted a long time. In its course it went through many changes, formed tribal and political structures, fought wars, also with the Romans, until in the 5th century AD its highly developed society of farmers, artisans, warriors and chiefs left for <b>the</b> <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> the fallen empire lands (for many of them it happened possibly rather quickly, {{during the first half}} of that century).|$|E
5|$|The colonial {{impact on}} the Igbo in Achebe's novels is often {{effected}} by individuals from Europe, but institutions and urban offices frequently serve a similar purpose. The character of Obi in No Longer at Ease succumbs to colonial-era corruption in the city; <b>the</b> <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> his position overwhelm his identity and fortitude. The courts and the position of District Commissioner in Things Fall Apart likewise clash with {{the traditions of the}} Igbo, and remove their ability to participate in structures of decision-making.|$|E

As a child growing up in the Chicago area, Wade idolized Chicago Bulls star Michael Jordan, and has said he patterns his game after him.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{literary}} critics Maman S. Mahayana, Oyon Sofyan, and Achmad Dian, Hasan's psychological struggles reflect Sigmund Freud's theories on psychoanalysis. Teeuw notes that Hasan {{comes across as}} being disappointed that his traditional religious upbringing {{is not enough to}} overcome <b>the</b> <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> the modern world. Poet and critic of Indonesian literature Muhammad Balfas writes that Hasan's conflict arises from being torn intellectually between the teachings of his ultra-religious father and the Marxist Rusli, {{while at the same time}} being emotionally victimised by the ever self-confident Anwar. Balfas notes that three versions of Hasan are made apparent to the reader: Hasan's view of himself, the narrator's view of Hasan, and the narrator's reconstruction of Hasan.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} high regard for natural law and {{for the idea of}} a {{universe}} without miracles, deists were especially susceptible to <b>the</b> <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> determinism.

25|$|Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress is {{an allegory}} of {{personal}} salvation and {{a guide to}} the Christian life.

The book is written in a straightforward narrative and shows influence from both drama and biography, and yet it also shows an awareness of the allegorical tradition found in Edmund Spenser.|$|E

Saint Mary Magdalen de Pazzi (1566–1607) and Saint Veronica Giuliani (1660–1727) were both observed binge eating—giving in, as they believed, to <b>the</b> <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> the devil. Saint Catherine of Siena (1347–1380) is known to have supplemented her strict abstinence from food by purging as reparation for her sins. Catherine died from starvation at age thirty-three.|$|E
25|$|Yet <b>the</b> <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> {{the city}} and corrupting companionships could easily lead a {{perfectly}} diligent servant {{into the path of}} crime. A mounting anxiety grew between eighteenth-century Londoners regarding the danger posed by servants seeking employment in order to steal or open the house at night to their accomplices. According to Defoe, living in fear and suspicion of your servants, as feeling unsafe outdoors at night, means to live in an hostile country, a depiction unworthy of his idea of a flourishing England.|$|E
25|$|Much of Augustine's {{later life}} was {{recorded}} {{by his friend}} Possidius, bishop of Calama (present-day Guelma, Algeria), in his Sancti Augustini Vita. Possidius admired Augustine {{as a man of}} powerful intellect and a stirring orator who took every opportunity to defend Christianity against its detractors. Possidius also described Augustine's personal traits in detail, drawing a portrait of a man who ate sparingly, worked tirelessly, despised gossip, shunned <b>the</b> <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> the flesh, and exercised prudence in the financial stewardship of his see.|$|E

25|$|The {{remaining}} 12 pictures {{indicate the}} virtuosity that these artists had attained, and the obvious cooperation between individuals who normally employed very different styles and skills. The paintings gave full range to their capabilities as they included {{a great number}} of figures of men, women and children and characters ranging from guiding angels to enraged Pharaohs and the devil himself. Each painting required a landscape. Because of the scale of the figures that the artists agreed upon, in each picture, the landscape and sky take up the whole upper half of the scene. Sometimes, as in Botticelli's scene of The Purification of the Leper, there are additional small narratives taking place in the landscape, in this case <b>The</b> <b>Temptations</b> <b>of</b> Christ.|$|E
500|$|Whereas Huntley, Inglis and Walker {{consider}} that Harrison is addressing a lover in [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long", other commentators, like Giuliano, view the lyrics as being {{consistent with the}} predominant theme of Living in the Material World – namely, Harrison's spiritual search amid <b>the</b> <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> the physical world. Of these commentators, Nicholas Schaffner and Bob Woffinden highlight [...] "Sue Me, Sue You Blues" [...] as the album's only song with a non-religious subject matter.|$|E

The act was repealed in 1886, after agitation by early feminists, such as Josephine Butler and Elizabeth Wolstenholme, {{led to the formation of}} the Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics to}} the song serve as a {{confession}} in which Harrison details how he has lost his way. Author Ian Inglis describes [...] "Simply Shady" [...] as an autobiographical account of a musician [...] "who succumbs to <b>the</b> <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> 'sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll' that are stereotypically linked with the mythology of rock". Leng likens the track to contemporary work by Neil Young, particularly [...] "Yonder Stands the Sinner", adding that Harrison arrives at [...] "the same impasse" [...] as the Canadian singer: [...] "decadence, dependency, and despair".|$|E
500|$|Harrison biographer Gary Tillery observes of {{this period}} when the song was written: [...] "Despite his spiritual hunger, [...] <b>the</b> <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> a rock star were still too much to resist. He had affairs with other women, and he became less guarded about them with Pattie." [...] One such affair took place shortly after the couple's return from New York, in December 1968, and {{involved}} Charlotte Martin, a French model who had just ended a relationship with Harrison's friend and occasional collaborator Eric Clapton. Harrison invited Martin to stay at Kinfauns, the home he shared with Boyd in Esher, south of London, whereupon, according to Boyd: [...] "She didn't seem remotely upset about Eric..." ...|$|E
500|$|Joint cathedral {{status was}} awarded by Pope Innocent IV to Bath and Wells in 1245. Roger of Salisbury was {{appointed}} the first Bishop of Bath and Wells, having been Bishop of Bath {{for a year}} previously. Later bishops preferred Wells, the canons of which had successfully petitioned various popes down the years for Wells to regain cathedral status. Bath Cathedral gradually fell into disrepair. In 1485 the priory had 22 monks. When Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells 1495–1503, visited Bath in 1499 he was shocked to find this famous church in ruins. He also described lax discipline, idleness {{and a group of}} monks [...] "all too eager to succumb to <b>the</b> <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> the flesh".|$|E

500|$|Working with William Paulet and Walter Mildmay, Warwick {{tackled the}} {{disastrous}} {{state of the}} kingdom's finances. However, his regime first succumbed to <b>the</b> <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> a quick profit by further debasing the coinage. The economic disaster that resulted caused Warwick to hand the initiative to the expert Thomas Gresham. By 1552, confidence in the coinage was restored, prices fell, and trade at last improved. Though a full economic recovery was not achieved until Elizabeth's reign, its origins lay in the Duke of Northumberland's policies. The regime also cracked down on widespread embezzlement of government finances, and carried out a thorough review of revenue collection practices, which has been called [...] "one of the more remarkable achievements of Tudor administration".|$|E
500|$|Many {{scholars}} see Banquo as a {{foil and}} {{a contrast to}} Macbeth. Macbeth, for example, eagerly accepts the Three Witches' prophecy as true and seeks to help it along. Banquo, on the other hand, doubts the prophecies and the intentions of these seemingly evil creatures. Whereas Macbeth places his hope in the prediction {{that he will be}} king, Banquo argues that evil only offers gifts that lead to destruction. Banquo steadily resists <b>the</b> <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> evil within the play, praying to heaven for help, while Macbeth seeks darkness, and prays that evil powers will aid him. This is visible in act two; after Banquo sees Duncan to bed, he says: [...] "There's husbandry in heaven, / Their candles are all out". This premonition of the coming darkness in association with Macbeth's murders is repeated just before Banquo is killed: [...] "it will be rain to-night", Banquo tells his son Fleance.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{ratification}} of the Clause, compulsory process was not originally interpreted to permit co-defendants to testify for each other. States relied on a fear that two defendants would both [...] "swear the other [...] " [...] of the charge to prevent either defendant from being convicted. In Benson v. United States (1892), the Supreme Court explained the underlying common law theory for this prohibition; namely, that only witnesses who were [...] "unaffected as a party by the result, and free from any of <b>the</b> <b>temptations</b> <b>of</b> interest" [...] could testify. Federal courts accepted these common law rules and expressly applied them in United States v. Reid (1852). In Reid, the Court held that the common law pertaining to criminal procedure in force {{at the time of}} the Constitution's ratification would be applied in federal courts; this effectively kept the bar on co-defendant testimony. While Reid was overruled on different grounds in 1918, it stated the general practice for co-defendants as witnesses that existed before the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
