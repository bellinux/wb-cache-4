In 1977, Turley joined with Arthur L. Williams, Jr. and five others to found A. L. Williams & Associates, an insurance company. At A. L. Williams, agents advised clients to purchase <b>term</b> <b>life</b> <b>insurance,</b> rather than cash value life insurance, and invest the money they saved in mutual funds. The company became Primerica Financial Services, and was later bought out by Citigroup in 1989. He retired from the business in 2001, and sold half of his business to his son and the other half to Lynn Webb, a senior national sales director.|$|E

2500|$|An {{insurance}} underwriter's job is {{to evaluate}} a given risk as to {{the likelihood that a}} loss will occur. Any factor that causes a greater likelihood of loss should theoretically be charged a higher rate. This basic principle of insurance must be followed if insurance companies are to remain solvent. Thus, [...] "discrimination" [...] against (i.e., negative differential treatment of) potential insureds in the risk evaluation and premium-setting process is a necessary by-product of the fundamentals of insurance underwriting. For instance, insurers charge older people significantly higher premiums than they charge younger people for <b>term</b> <b>life</b> <b>insurance.</b> Older people are thus treated differently from younger people (i.e., a distinction is made, discrimination occurs). The rationale for the differential treatment {{goes to the heart of}} the risk a life insurer takes: Old people are likely to die sooner than young people, so the risk of loss (the insured's death) is greater in any given period of time and therefore the risk premium must be higher to cover the greater risk. However, treating insureds differently when there is no actuarially sound reason for doing so is unlawful discrimination.|$|E

40|$|This paper reviews {{both the}} {{interpretation}} of good faith and its implementation by the Court in <b>terms</b> of <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> contracts.

Until recent days, however, judges in all levels of Court did not have any shared and full understanding on {{the interpretation of}} good faith in <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> contracts.

5000|$|A {{modification}} from Amicable's <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> {{was developed}} by [...] "The Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorships." [...] This new <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> society {{was developed by}} Halley, De Moivre, Simpson, De Parcieux, and Dodson. The reason for the new society (<b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> company) was because Dodson, who was over 55, wanted to have his life insured but was turned down by the Amicable Society, so formed a new society. In 1757 a petition for a charter of incorporation was submitted. It was worked on for four years, but ultimately turned down in 1761. In 1762 a modification of the original terms was finally agreed upon and the society started a business of <b>life</b> <b>insurance.</b> The society {{was referred to as}} the [...] "Equitable" [...] and it issued policies for <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> of fixed sums on single or joint lives, or on survivorships, and for any <b>term.</b> Equitable's <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> was different than Amicable's in that the premiums were regulated according to age. Anybody could be insured and were admitted regardless of their state of health and other circumstances. The initial scheme of Equitable had many imperfections, but through time developed into <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> as we know it today.|$|R

40|$|Using a two-account {{model with}} event risk, we model <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> {{contracts}} {{taking into account}} both guaranteed and non-guaranteed payments in participating <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> {{as well as in}} unit-linked insurance.

Another goal is to describe similarities and differences between participating <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> and unit-linked insurance. By use of a two-account model, we are able to illustrate general concepts without making the model too abstract. To allow for complicated financial markets without dramatically increasing the mathematical complexity, we focus on economic scenarios. We illustrate the use of our model by conducting scenario analysis based on Monte Carlo simulation, but the model applies to scenarios in general and to worst-case and best-estimate scenarios in particular. In addition to easy computations, our model offers a common framework for the valuation of <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> payments across product types. This enables comparison of participating <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> products and unit-linked insurance products, thus building a bridge between the two different ways of formalizing <b>life</b> <b>insurance</b> products. Finally, our model distinguishes itself from the existing literature by taking into account the Markov model for the state of the policyholder and, hereby, facilitating event risk...|$|R
