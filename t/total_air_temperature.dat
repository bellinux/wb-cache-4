25|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} faulty air temperature probe (the <b>total</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> sensor, located {{on the front of}} the aircraft near the cockpit) that initially caused the pilot to turn the plane back for maintenance before the second takeoff attempt. The mechanic simply deactivated the probe because the aircraft's Minimum Equipment List allowed it to be left inoperative. On 22 August investigators interviewed the mechanic, who defended his action by saying that it had nothing to do with the crash. Spanair has supported the mechanic's view that deactivation of the probe is an accepted procedure. On 1 September a report, quoting Spanair, stated that the problem detected on the first takeoff attempt was overheating caused by a temperature gauge's de-icing system, rather than a dysfunction of the temperature gauge itself, and that since icing was not a risk on that flight, the de-icing system had been deactivated by the mechanic with captain's approval.|$|E

For global change research, changes in geophysical parameters (e. g. water vapor, rainfall, etc.) are referenced to the accompanying changes in temperature. If the retrieval of a certain parameter has a cross-talk response from temperature change alone, the retrievals might not be very useful for climate research.

The lack of seagrass research in Malaysia {{raises questions about the}} status of seagrasses in the country. The seagrasses in Lawas, {{which is part of the}} coral-mangrove-seagrass complex, have never been studied in detail. In this study, we examine whether monthly changes of seagrass population in Lawas occurred. Data on estimates of seagrass percentage cover and water physicochemical parameters (pH, turbidity, salinity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen) were measured at 84 sampling stations established within the study area from June 2009 to May 2010. Meteorological data such as <b>total</b> rainfall, <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> and Southern Oscillation Index were also investigated. Our results showed that (i) the monthly changes of seagrass percentage cover are significant, (ii) the changes correlated significantly with turbidity measurements, and (iii) weather changes affected the seagrass populations. Our study indicates seagrass percentage increased during the El-Nino period. These results suggest that natural disturbances such as weather changes affect seagrass populations. Evaluation of land usage and measurements of other water physicochemical parameters (such as heavy metal, pesticides, and nutrients) should be considered to assess the health of seagrass ecosystem at the study area...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{ventilation}} (NV) can considerably {{contribute to}} reducing the cooling energy consumption {{of a building}} and increase occupant productivity, if correctly implemented. Such energy savings depend {{on the number of}} hours that NV can maintain the indoor <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> within comfort levels. CoolVent, currently the only simple multizone simulation tool that can adequately model the physics of NV in buildings, assumes a uniform temperature distribution in each room or zone. This temperature corresponds to the exhaust <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> of each room using an energy balance. In reality, however, the air in a room is often thermally stratified, and the <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> at occupant level can be significantly lower than the exhaust temperature. The final goal of this thesis was to develop a set of criteria to predict the vertical temperature profile in naturally ventilated rooms by comparing the strength of buoyant to inertial forces in the space, based on a few critical room airflow and physical parameters. Developing such criteria required conducting a thorough study of the physics of turbulent jets and plumes, their development in room-sized enclosures, and their effect on the airflow and heat transfer dynamics in a room. Additionally, it was necessary to investigate, using Computational Fluid Dynamics, the effect of certain parameters -such as radiative heat transfer, heat source distribution and room geometry, among others- on the physics of room airflow simulations. Results shed light on the complexity of modeling room airflow and thermal physics analytically, particularly when the air is thermally stratified. Thermal stratification predictions indicate that multi-zone models overestimate the <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> at occupant height by up to 40 % of the <b>total</b> room <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> change. This work enhances the physical understanding of modeling critical elements of room airflow and improves the predictive accuracy of the natural ventilation potential in buildings. These contributions promote a wider use of passive cooling strategies, thereby increasing the energy efficiency of the built environment. by Maria Alejandra Menchaca Brandan. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|A {{model for}} the {{parameterization}} of lake temperatures and lake ice thicknesses in atmospheric models is presented. The model is verified independently, {{and it is also}} tested {{within the framework of the}} High Resolution Limited Area Model(HIRLAM), applied operationally for short range weather forecasting at the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI). The lake model is a slab model based upon energy conservation and treats the lakes as well mixed boxes with depths represented by the mean depths. The model is forced by near surface fluxes calculated from <b>total</b> cloudiness, <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> <b>air</b> humidity and low-level winds. A data base, describing 92000 Swedish lakes. provides the model with lake mean depths, areal sizes and locations. When the model is used for parameterization of lake effects in the atmospheric model, all the smaller lakes and the fractions of larger lakes within each horizontal grid square of the atmospheric model are parameterized by four model lakes, representing the lake size distribution. The verification of the lake model is done by comparing it with a more advanced, vertically resolved model, including parameterization of turbulent mixing processes, as well as by comparison with observations. A sensitivity test shows great interannual variations of the ice-covered season, which implies that lake models should be used instead of climate data. The results from an experiment with two-way coupling of the lake model to the atmospheric model are verified by comparing forecasted weather parameters with routine meteorological observations. These results show that the impact of lake effects can reach several degrees C in <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> close to the surface...|$|R

40|$|High {{specific}} discharges from Himalayan headwater basins {{arises from}} seasonal winter snow cover, summer monsoon precipitation and melting glacier ice in varying proportions and differing absolute quantities along west –east axes of the Karakoram and western Himalaya. Discharge records for {{stations in the}} UIB, Jhelum, Chenab and Sutlej have been examined for periods between 1920 and 2009, together with precipitation and <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> data for stations with long records (within the period 1876 to 2013) at elevations between 234 and 3015 m a. s. l. Ice-cover age in the basins was between 222. 8 and 15, 061. 7 km 2. Climate in the Karakoram had a distinct opposing regime to climate in the western Himalaya. Totals of summer and winter precipitation at climate stations in the UIB reached their maxima in the 1990 s. Winter precipitation in the western Himalaya generally declined from the 1980 s, while summer precipitation declined since the 1950 s but recovered from the 2000 s. Mean summer <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> had an inverse relationship with seasonal <b>totals</b> of precipitation. <b>Air</b> <b>temperatures</b> at UIB climate stations reached their maxima in the 1970 s before declining to the 1990 s, failing to recover in the 2000 s. <b>Air</b> <b>temperatures</b> from mountain stations in the Himalaya displayed maxima in the 2000 s, as did climate stations in Tibet.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between shelterbelt (tree windbreak) -induced microclimate and muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.) {{growth and development}} were investigated at the Univ. of Nebraska-Lincoln Agricultural Research and Development Center near Mead, Nebr., during the 1992 and 1993 growing seasons. Wind speed, wind direction, <b>air</b> and soil <b>temperatures,</b> relative humidity, and soil moisture were monitored in both sheltered and nonsheltered areas. Plant growth parameters (plant height, vine length, plant dry weight, and leaf area) were measured at various stages of development. Shelterbelts provided improved growing conditions for muskmelon transplants. Direct wind damage and duration of higher wind speeds were reduced 47 % to 56 % in sheltered areas. <b>Air</b> <b>temperatures</b> in sheltered areas were slightly higher during daytime and slightly lower at night, and significantly {{so early in the}} growing season. Relative humidity was increased significantly in sheltered areas in 1992 and, while higher in 1993, the difference was nonsignificant. Soil moisture content was not affected significantly by wind protection. Sheltered plants exhibited earlier development and faster growth. The first female flower appeared 2 days earlier in sheltered areas in both years. The first fruit set, as indicated by fruit swelling and retention on the vine, occurred 6 days earlier and matured 5 and 6 days earlier in sheltered areas in 1992 and 1993, respectively. Leaf areas and dry-matter accumulation of sheltered plants were greater than those of exposed plants. The shoot relative growth rate of sheltered plants increased earlier in the growing season, but decreased slightly later in the growing season. The earlier development and faster growth of sheltered plants were related mainly to the reduction of wind speed, higher <b>total</b> accumulated <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> during the daylight hours (sum of daily average daytime <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> based on hourly averages), and higher soil temperature in sheltered areas. Total yields were not affected significantly in either year; however, early yields were significantly greater in sheltered areas in 1993.

The research aimed at recognising time structure and variability of tropospheric ozone {{as a function}} of daytime and nocturnal meteorological conditions, particularly in the spring season (March–May), as well as fi nding a weather cluster at which the highest O 3 concentration occurs. Ozone concentrations recorded every hour during the two years and data on fi ve other meteorological elements: <b>total</b> solar radiation, <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> relative <b>air</b> humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind direction and speed provided the input data for the analysis.

However, {{there are only a}} few studies on heat transfer of transpired plate for solar collector applications. In addition, most of them were based on uniform flow distribution which assumed that air temperature in the plenum is always constant.

From the experimental results, it was found that the contribution of vertical flow in <b>total</b> <b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> rise was 40 % and above. Hence, the heat transfer from the back-of-plate to the air in the plenum is inappropriate to be ignored. The theoretical calculation was based on an average value instead of local heat transfer.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the roof solar {{reflectance}} on the thermal performance of a building is often ignored. However, there are significant differences in heat gain from light and dark-coloured roof surfaces. In this paper an equation for the average daily downward heat flow of a sunlit roof is derived. Using building simulation, it is first shown that the thermal mass of the roof does not significantly affect the overall daily heat gain (although it causes a time lag and reduction in peak heat flow). As a consequence the daily heat gain from the roof may be estimated by integrating the equation for the steady-state downward heat transfer over the day. For north Australia the derived equation suggests that a light-coloured roof has about 30 % lower <b>total</b> (<b>air</b> <b>temperature</b> difference and solar-driven) heat gain than a dark-coloured one. The effect of aging (change in solar reflectance with time) is considered in the calculations and {{a relationship between the}} solar absorptance of new and aged material is suggested.

To understand the exchange dynamics between Winam Gulf and the offshore waters of Lake Victoria and the hydrodynamics of the region, field {{studies were carried out}} from Apr. 22 -May 4 and Aug. 5 - 16 of 2005. A meteorological station (shortwave, <b>total</b> radiation, <b>air</b> <b>temperature,</b> relative humidity, wind speed and direction), thermistor chain (0. 75 m vertical resolution) and ADCP (40 cm vertical resolution) were deployed in Rusinga Channel in a depth of 20 m. Similarly, at an offshore station in northeastern Lake Victoria another thermistor chain was deployed in a water depth of 40 m along with wind speed and direction sensors. Over both field campaigns the exchange dynamics through Rusinga Channel behaved similar to a tidally-driven system with surface level fluctuations of between 5 - 15 cm at the ADCP location, and much larger excursions at the eastern end of Winam Gulf. In general, these surface level movements led to barotropically driven flows into the Gulf during rising surface levels and currents towards the open lake during falling lake level. The frequency of these currents was found to vary between 6 and 12 hours and current speeds ranged from 10 - 50 cm s- 1. Field data and ELCOM simulations indicate that despite the high current velocities in the channel the net exchange is low due to the oscillatory nature of the forcing.
