40|$|Ion {{backflow}} {{is one of}} {{the effects}} limiting the operation of a gaseous detector at high flux, by giving rise to space charge which perturbs the electric field. The natural ability of bulk Micromegas to suppress ion feedback is very effective and can help the TPC drift volume to remain relatively free of space charge build-up. An efficient and precise measurement of the backflow fraction is necessary to cope up with the <b>track</b> <b>distortion</b> due to the space charge effect. In a subtle but significant modification of the usual approach, we have made use of two drift meshes in order to measure the ion backflow fraction for bulk Micromegas detector. This helps to truly represent the backflow fraction for a TPC. Moreover, attempt is taken to optimize the field configuration between the drift meshes. In conjunction with the experimental measurement, Garfield simulation framework has been used to simulate the related physics processes numerically...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} overview and final summary {{of all four}} types of static <b>track</b> <b>distortions</b> seen in the HARP TPC, in terms of physical origins, mathematical modelling, and correction algorithms. 'Static'Â distortions are defined as not depending on the event time within the 400 ms long accelerator spill. Calculated static distortions are compared with measurements from cosmic-muon tracks. We characterize <b>track</b> <b>distortions</b> by the r phi residuals of cluster positions {{with respect to the}} transverse projection of a helical trajectory constrained by hits in the RPC overlap regions. This method provides a fixed TPC-external reference system (by contrast to the co-moving coordinate system associated with a fit) which solely permits to identify individually, and measure quantitatively, the static TPC <b>track</b> <b>distortions</b> arising from (i) the inhomogeneity of the solenoidal magnetic field, (ii) the inhomogeneity of the electric field from the high-voltage mismatch between the inner and outer TPC field cages, (iii) the anode-wire durchgriff, and (iv) a homogenous ion-charge density in the drift volume. Five voltage levels are identified which were set incorrectly during data taking with the HARP TPC, and unfortunately conspired toward large static and dynamic <b>track</b> <b>distortions.</b> The observed time development of static distortions after a 83 mKr calibration lends decisive support to our conclusions on static TPC distortions...|$|R

There is a film riding device that does accommodate distortion and is in service in aircraft applications, namely the foil bearing. More specifically a foil thrust bearing. These are {{not intended to be}} seals, and they do not accommodate large axial movement between shaft & static structure. By combining the 2 a unique type of face seal has been created. It functions like a normal face seal. The foil thrust bearing replaces the normal primary sealing surface. The compliance of the foil bearing allows the foils to <b>track</b> <b>distortion</b> of the mating seal ring. The foil seal has several perceived advantages over existing hydrodynamic designs, enumerated in the chart. Materials and design methodology needed for this application already exist.

50|$|The accidents' {{immediate}} {{reason was}} determined {{as the following}} : The involved dining car type caused (by its exceptional length and the position of its bogies) a higher horizontal buffer misalignment than the other car types. It lacked buffers that were broad enough to handle this offset, so buffers slipped past each other and jammed, preventing the required lateral movement. The report recommends to review the buffers that are in use, and to replace them if necessary.The track layout showed to have some deficiencies regarding the sequence of curves, specifically straight elements inside S-curves. The combination of track elements within a small area had taken them to the allowable limits, increasing wear and reducing stability. The report discusses different layouts.

40|$|Inhomogeneities of the {{magnetic}} and electric fields in the active TPC volume lead to displacements of cluster coordinates, and therefore to <b>track</b> <b>distortions.</b> In case of good data taking conditions, the largest effects are expected from the inhomogeneity of the solenoidal magnetic field, and from a distortion of the electric field arising from a high voltage misalignment between the outer and inner field cages. Both effects are stable over the entire HARP data taking. The displacements are large compared to the azimuthal coordinate resolution but can be corrected with sufficient precision, except at small TPC radius. The high voltage misalignment between the outer and inner field cages is identified as the likely primary cause of sagitta <b>distortions</b> of TPC <b>tracks.</b> The position {{and the length of}} the target plays an important role.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} discussion and summary of static and dynamic <b>track</b> <b>distortions</b> in the HARP TPC {{in terms of}} physical origin, mathematical modelling and correction algorithms. `Static' distortions are constant with time, while `dynamic' distortions are distortions that occur only during the 400 ms long accelerator spill. The measurement of dynamic distortions, their mathematical modelling and the correction algorithms build on our understanding of static distortions. In the course of corroborating the validity of our static distortion corrections, their reliability and precision was further improved. Dynamic TPC distortions originate dominantly from the `stalactite' effect: a column of positive-ion charge starts growing at the begin of the accelerator spill, and continues growing with nearly constant velocity out from the sense-wire plane into the active TPC volume. However, the `stalactite' effect {{is not able to}} describe the distortions that are present already {{at the start of the}} spill and which have a sign opposite to the one of `stalactite' distortions. The 'margaritka' effect accounts for this: the radially outward oriented electric field generated by a deposit of positive ions on the insulating inner ring of the TPC readout chamber...|$|R

The intuitive method is to simulate the de-coding process many times at the encoder, as used in the H. 264 test model. However, the computing complexity is very high.

Con-cretely, the correlations of the potentially propagated errors of the dif-ferent frames are modeled based on the theoretical analysis, and then a block-based potential <b>distortion</b> <b>tracking</b> scheme with very low comput-ing complexity is proposed. Statistics show that the gaps of the estimated distortions between the proposed algorithm and the H. 264 test model be-come smaller and smaller when the times of simulated decoding in H. 264 test model increases. In other words, the proposed algorithm is more accurate than H. 264 test model. Moreover, an improved rate-distortion optimization algorithm based on the optimum end-to-end distortion es-timation is proposed, wherein the rate control is also jointly utilized. ...|$|R
