5000|$|The <b>thick-billed</b> <b>lark</b> (Rhamphocoris clotbey), a North African and Middle Eastern desert bird, {{was named}} in Clot's honor by naturalist Charles Lucien Bonaparte.|$|E
5000|$|The large-billed lark or {{southern}} <b>thick-billed</b> <b>lark</b> (Galerida magnirostris) {{is a small}} passerine bird {{found in}} southern Africa. The name [...] "large-billed lark" [...] may also refer to Bradfield's lark. The name [...] "thick-billed lark" [...] more commonly refers to the species {{of the same name}} (i.e. Rhamphocoris clotbey).|$|E
50|$|Like many ground birds, most lark {{species have}} long hind claws, which {{are thought to}} provide {{stability}} while standing. Most have streaked brown plumage, some boldly marked with black or white. Their dull appearance camouflages them on the ground, especially when on the nest. They feed on insects and seeds; though adults of most species eat seeds primarily, all species feed their young insects {{for at least the}} first week after hatching. Many species dig with their bills to uncover food. Some larks have heavy bills (reaching an extreme in the <b>thick-billed</b> <b>lark)</b> for cracking seeds open, while others have long, down-curved bills, which are especially suitable for digging.|$|E
50|$|The park's main {{conservation}} {{importance is}} that it holds {{three of the four}} Moroccan colonies of the northern bald ibis (Geronticus eremita). Together with the fourth site at nearby Tamri, it holds 95% of the world's truly wild breeding birds of this endangered species. The ibis colonies and roost-sites are located on coastal cliffs within the National Park, and the coastal steppes and fields are used as feeding areas. The park has a nature trail at Oued Souss and a visitor centre at Oued Massa.The Oued Massa holds water throughout the year and has breeding marbled ducks, a globally threatened species. It is the only known Moroccan breeding site for the glossy ibis. The two estuaries are important for migrants, especially waders and gulls. European spoonbill and Audouin's gull winter in the park. Other notable breeding bird species are red-necked nightjar, <b>thick-billed</b> <b>lark,</b> Tristram's warbler and Moussier's redstart.|$|E
40|$|The diverse {{breeding}} bird fauna of Israel comprises elements from various zoogeographical regions. This is predominantly {{attributed to the}} zoogeo-graphic position of Israel and its high habitat diversity. In this article I provide information on six bird species new to breeding in Israel since 1995 : green-backed heron (Butorides striatus), purple gallinule (Porphyrio porphyrio), painted snipe (Rostratula benghalensis), <b>thick-billed</b> <b>lark</b> (Rhamphocoris clotbey), wallcreeper (Tichodroma muraria), and common mynah (Acrido-theres tristis). The data provided here on the breeding habits of each species vary in extent. A recently fledged wallcreeper comprises the only indication of the species ’ breeding in the country, or near its borders. In the cases of the purple gallinule and the painted snipe, adults were found rearing their young, while the green-backed heron and, especially, the <b>thick-billed</b> <b>lark</b> were studied throughout their entire breeding period. The common mynah is a recently introduced species whose local breeding features {{have not yet been}} thoroughly studied. The wallcreeper has a Central Palearctic distribution, while the remaining species or subspecies have a desert distribution within the Palearctic or a Paleotropic distribution. It is striking that most of the local breeding events of these species are closely connected to human-induced habitat modifications. With the addition of these six new breeding species, the total number of bird species found to breed in Israel is now 210, although some of these species no longer do so...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 117 bird species has been {{recorded}} in Sehlabathebe National Park, south-east Lesotho, consisting of 29 vagrants, 18 visitors and 70 breeding and probable breeding residents. For each species status was determined and abundance roughly estimated. Quantitative studies on breeding bird communities were carried out {{by means of the}} line transect method on four transects with the total length ca 30 km in the park and on two transects with the total length of ca 20 km outside the park. In the park, dominant species were represented by the Stonechat Saxicola torquata, Ayres ’ Cisticola Cisticola ayresii, Yellow-rumped Widow Euplectes capensis and Wailing Cisticola Cisticola lais. Outside the park dominants were represented by Cape Weaver Ploceus capensis, Cape Sparrow Passer melanurus, Cape Canary Serinus canicollis, Common Quail Coturnix coturnix, Stonechat, Cape Bunting Emberiza capensis and Drakensberg Siskin Pseudochloroptila symonsi. Characteristic, high-altitude species in the park included Drakensberg Siskin, Mountain Pipit Anthus hoeschi, Orange-breasted Rockjumper Chaetops auriantius, Banded Martin Riparia cincta and Sentinel Rock Thrush Monticola explorator. Species such as the Laughing Dove Streptopelia senegalensis, Sicklewinged Chat Cercomela sinuata, Mountain Chat Oenanthe monticola, <b>Thick-billed</b> <b>Lark</b> Galerida magnirostris, Red-winged Starling Onychognathus morio, Alpine Swift Apus melba Cape Sparrow, Grey-headed Sparrow Passer diffusus, Red Bishop Euplectes orix and Golden Bishop Euplectes afer were absent or occurred in very low densities in the park, although they are widespread and common in the Maluti/Drakensberg grasslands (including areas neighbouring to the park). The lack of trees and shrubs for nesting, the lack of cultivated fields as feeding places and competition with related species both for food and nesting sites, may partly play a role in this regard...|$|E
