5000|$|In opinion polling, {{voters are}} {{frequently}} asked for their choice from among {{a list of}} candidates; a candidate who is not listed as a choice {{may be less likely}} to receive unprompted support during a political poll, and methods of push polling can persuade a voter towards choosing a certain candidate from a list. Surveys and opinion polling is made less reliable by social desirability bias, whereby respondents will report answers in public that may not share their personal views if they believe they are in the minority. Voters are also subject to stating support for candidates that are well-known and recognizable, although they may not have the enthusiasm and commitment to the candidate necessary to generate a vote. Ronald Reagan was noted as having soft support because his 1980 presidential campaign enjoyed leads in opinion polling because he was a famous actor; his campaigning during the early months was casual and infrequent, and was vulnerable to a more aggressive candidate. During the 1984 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Walter Mondale had notoriously soft support among voters, and his opponents Reubin Askew and Gary Hart scored several upset victories over him despite political polling showing Mondale as a definite frontrunner. At one point in the campaign Askew told reporters, [...] "The support Mondale has in Florida and frankly throughout the nation is still very soft. The election is still winnable even though <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> (otherwise)." ...|$|E

40|$|The 9 / 11 {{terror attacks}} {{prompted}} {{a large number}} of public opinion surveys in the Islamic world by Gallup, Pew, Zogby, and others seeking to understand the level and nature of muslim antagonism toward America. Far less {{attention has been paid to}} public opinion surveys of Americans concerning their views of Islam, Muslims, and Muslim countries. This thesis sorts through the surveys and presents some surprising findings. First, while American views of Muslim have generally been rather unfavorable, the events of 9 / 11 did not have a marked change on those views. Moreover, Americans tend to make distinctions between Muslims as individuals, toward whom they have a relatively favorable view; Muslim countries, toward which they have a varied view; and Islam as a religion, toward which they have the most negative view. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> that misunderstandings about Islam and Muslims are pervasive among Americans. This thesis argues that the American Muslim community must play a leading role in correcting such misperceptions. In the absence of a sustained effort, there is little in the survey data that would lead one to believe that a change in perception is imminent...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In recent years, {{energy policy}} {{has become an}} {{increasingly}} salient political issue in the United States. Rising gas prices, coupled with regional energy shortages and a growing recognition {{of the connection between}} U. S. energy supplies and national security, have led to calls for legislative action. Part of developing a national energy policy lies in un-derstanding public opinion about existing energy sources, public support for various energy strategies, and what the public might be willing {{to do in order to}} conserve energy and reduce U. S. reliance on foreign oil. In this review, we report trends in public opinion from 1974 through 2006 on traditional energy sources, alternative energy sources, and citi-zens ’ priorities on energy alternatives. <b>The</b> <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> that concern about the U. S. energy situation is as high now as it was during the nation’s energy crises of the 1970 s. While attitudes about traditional sources of energy are strongly influenced by current economic conditions, citizens are increasingly receptive to alternative sources of energy (e. g., nuclear energy). Citizens also support policy changes that involve the government encouraging conservation through energy efficient appliances, vehicles, and homes and offices. The public voices a growing frustration with President Bush’s, and the Congress’s, handling of the nation’s energy problems, and they express a desire for leadership in finding long-term solutions to the nation’s energy dilemmas...|$|E
40|$|The polls {{could be}} giving the wrong {{impression}} in three different ways, writes MURRAY GOOT in this analysis for APO, but that doesn’t mean the government is well placed to win ARE the polls exaggerating Labor’s lead? Will <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>show</b> the parties drawing much closer together once Howard calls the election? Is the Coalition’s position in its own marginals looking much {{better than any of}} the national polls suggest? If the answer to each of these questions is “yes” - indeed, if “yes” is the answer to any two of these questions - the government is still in with a chance. However, if the answer to each of these questions is “no” - or even if this is the right answer to just one of them - Labor is likely to win by a margin that will comfortably exceed Bob Hawke’s overwhelming victory in 1983. The possibility that the polls are exaggerating Labor’s lead cannot be discounted. Most commentators seem to think that because Labor is well ahead in all the polls - by 10 percentage points, two-party preferred (in last weekend’s Newspoll), by 14 points (the previous weekend’s ACNielsen poll and the Galaxy poll taken the weekend before that) or by 18 points (in the Morgan poll taken a week before the latest Newspoll) - the running average can’t be far wrong. This is especially true, the standard argument runs, because Labor has been a long way ahead for such a long time. But the conclusion doesn’t follow from the premise. It is perfectly possible that all the polls are exaggerating Labor’s position and underestimating the Coalition’s. Nor is this just a theoretical possibility. In 1980, the final figures from all four national polls (McNair Anderson, Morgan, Saulwick and Spectrum) underestimated how well the Coalition government would do and overestimated Labor. All the polls pointed to a Labor victory. But, in a debacle for the polling industry, Labor lost. Hasn’t polling got better since then? Not in the sense that if the polls all say the same thing they are bound to get the size of the lead right. In 2004, five of the six national polls underestimated the Coalition’s first preference vote; four also underestimated its two-party preferred. In 1996, three of the final polls underestimated the Coalition’s share of the two-party preferred and all four exaggerated Labor’s share of the first preferences. But the polls are just as capable of overestimating the Coalition’s position as they are of underestimating it. In 2001, three out of four national polling organisations exaggerated the Coalition’s lead; so, too, did four of the six national polls in 1998. What about {{the idea that there is}} likely to be a swing to the Coalition once Mr Howard goes to Yarralumla? This is a view that supporters of the Coalition have to hope is right. In 2004, there does appear to have been a swing to the Coalition between the calling of the election and the posting of the result. On the evidence of Newspoll and, less clearly, the evidence of the ACNielsen and Morgan polls, the formal campaign period saw the Coalition make gains at the expense of the Opposition. This time we may well see something similar. After all, if Howard were to call an election with Labor as far ahead in the polls as it is in the most recent ACNielsen poll (57 : 43), Galaxy poll (57 : 43) or Morgan poll (59 : 41) we would be entering uncharted territory. Labor won in 1983 with 53. 2 per cent and in 1972 with 52. 7 per cent of the two-party preferred. The Coalition won in 1996 with 53. 6 per cent and in 1975 with 55. 7 per cent of the two-party preferred. But you have to go back to 1943, when Labor was in office, when the Liberal Party was not yet formed and when the non-Labor forces were in complete disarray, to find a winning margin for Labor (58. 2 per cent, according to the estimate produced by Malcolm Mackerras) that is in the same territory as the margins suggested by these polls. However, far from being typical of recent elections, national election campaigns that see governments gain ground are not common. In the seven national election campaigns conducted since 1987 (the first in which Newspoll was a player), there has been only one occasion - the disastrous Hewson campaign of 1993 - other than 2004 when a government seems to have gained ground. By contrast, in the 1987 campaign, 1990 campaign and 1996 campaign - again, on the evidence of all the polls not just Newspoll - Labor governments lost support. (If we compare the polls at the beginning of the 1998 campaign to the election result itself, Newspoll detected no change in support for the government and opposition, ACNielsen showed the government losing ground, while Morgan had the government making up ground). Which brings us to the government’s last hope - its marginals. This is the line the prime minister went down when he told the party room that while the national polls were looking bad things were looking reasonably bright in the “bellwether” seat of Eden-Monaro - a seat that has changed hands only when the government itself has changed. The notion of a “bellwether” seat is as misleading as it is beloved: the government may succeed in propping up some marginals only to lose the rest - and then some - in a rout. Nonetheless, ultimately it is seats rather than votes that determine elections: some governments have failed to mobilise 50 per cent of the two-party preferred and yet held on to office. This was Howard’s experience in 1998, when the Coalition secured 49. 0 per cent of the two-party preferred, and it could happen again since this year since Labor needs 51. 3 per cent of the two-party preferred (assuming a “uniform swing”) to get enough seats to govern in its own right. Far from enjoying a swing that yields a predictable number of seats, Labor may find a disproportionate share of its gains locked up in seats it holds already or languishing in seats that are retained by the Coalition; for example, seats with a disproportionate number of voters known disparagingly as “doctors’ wives. ” That said, even if the Coalition is doing better than the latest Newspoll suggests, it is hard to believe that it could finish with just 47 per cent or 46 per cent of the two-party preferred and still be saved by keeping Labor at bay in its marginal seats. Without a further swing it is difficult to see how the Coalition can get back. • Murray Goot is professor of politics at Macquarie University and author, with Tim Rowse, of Divided Nation?
