5|$|By {{the end of}} October the Special Commission on Afghanistan, which {{consisted}} of Andropov, Gromyko, Ustinov and Ponomarev, wanted to end {{the impression that the}} Soviet government supported Amin's leadership and policy. The KGB's First Chief Directorate was put under orders that something had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> Afghanistan, and several of its personnel were assembled to deal with the task. Andropov fought hard for Soviet intervention, saying to Brezhnev that Amin's policies had destroyed the military and the government's capabilities to handle the crisis by use of mass repression. The plan, according to Andropov, was to assemble a small force to intervene and remove Amin from power and replace him with Karmal. The Soviet Union declared its plan to intervene in Afghanistan on 12 December 1979, and the Soviet leadership initiated Operation Storm-333 (the first phase of the intervention) on 27 December 1979.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid's monasteries in Mercia may {{date from}} this time, as King Wulfhere of Mercia gave him large grants {{of land in}} Mercia. Wilfrid may have persuaded King Ecgberht of Kent in 669 to build a church in an {{abandoned}} Roman fort at Reculver. When Theodore, the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, arrived in England in 669 {{it was clear that}} something had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> the situation in Northumbria. Ceadda's election to York was improper, and Theodore did not consider Ceadda's consecration to have been valid. Consequently, Theodore deposed Ceadda, leaving the way open for Wilfrid, who was finally installed in his see in 669, the first Saxon to occupy the see of York. Wilfrid spent the next nine years building churches, including at the monastery at Hexham, and attending to diocesan business. He continued to exercise control over his monastic houses of Ripon and Hexham while he was bishop. Oswiu's death on 15February 670 eliminated a source of friction and helped to assure Wilfrid's return.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{his many}} accomplishments, the event for which Ward is most remembered {{is the game}} he did not play. In 1934, Michigan had {{scheduled}} Georgia Tech as the third game of the season. After learning that Michigan had an African-American player, Georgia Tech football coach and athletic director W. A. [...] "Bill" [...] Alexander refused to allow his team to take the field if Ward played. [...] As early as the fall of 1933, Alexander wrote to Yost asking what was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> Ward, asserting that his team would not take the field if Ward played.|$|E

500|$|On February 21, 1989, former Neshoba County sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey filed {{a lawsuit}} against Orion Pictures, {{claiming}} defamation and invasion of privacy. The lawsuit, filed at a United States district court in Meridian, Mississippi, asked for $8 million in damages. Rainey, who was the county sheriff {{at the time of the}} 1964 murders, alleged that the filmmakers of Mississippi Burning had portrayed him in an unfavorable light with the fictional character of Sheriff Ray Stuckey (Gailard Sartain). [...] "Everybody all over the South knows the one they have playing the sheriff in that movie is referring to me," [...] he stated. [...] "What they said happened and what they did to me certainly wasn't right and something ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] Rainey's lawsuit was unsuccessful; he dropped the suit after Orion's team of lawyers threatened to prove that the film was based on fact, and that Rainey was indeed suspected in the 1964 murders.|$|E
500|$|Marc Buxton at Den of Geek {{scored the}} episode 3.5 out of 5, calling the Age of Ultron tie-in [...] "anti-climactic ... {{it felt like}} a bit of a cheat", criticizing what he saw as too much of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s own storyline being left for the film to resolve, but said that [...] "all in all, it was a rather good episode". Buxton said that Skye [...] "really shined this episode", and called her {{one-shot}} fight [...] "worthy of a rewind or two", while highlighting [...] "one of the biggest character moments" [...] in the episode with Simmons' decision to kill Ward. Rob Leane, also at Den of Geek, was more positive of the Age of Ultron tie-in, calling it [...] "the next best allusion to the movies we’ve ever had" [...] following the series' connections to Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and praising the use of List and Hill. He positively compared Skye's one-shot fight sequence to the well known single-take sequences in The Avengers and Daredevil, calling it [...] "the very welcome TV equivalent" [...] of the [...] "air-punching fan-pleasing moments" [...] often found in Marvel's films. Leane also compared Coulson's [...] "real mission-within-a-mission" [...] reveal to a similar moment in The Winter Soldier, and summarized [...] "The Dirty Half Dozen" [...] as [...] "a thoroughly entertaining episode, thanks in equal part to the tie-in stuff, some solid action and several strong character moments. Ward’s return was handled well, too, although something needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> Simmons’ growing unlikeable-ness." ...|$|E

Apparently the arrest of Giuffrè in April 2002 was made possible by an anonymous phone call that seems to have been made by loyalists to the Mafia hardliners Riina and Bagarella. The purpose was {{to send a message to}} Provenzano.

2500|$|Emperor Gaozu was sailing {{on a lake}} {{inside the}} Palace City {{during the time of}} the coup. [...] speculates that the emperor was alarmed by the {{impending}} crisis, thus he withdrew himself from the situation. He also surrounded himself with senior officials who were friendly to Li Shimin, because he possibly realized that Li Shimin was the cause of this and had better military connections that provided him with the advantage. The officials were Pei Ji, Xiao Yu, Chen Shuda, Feng Lun, Yan Shigu, Dou Dan (竇誕), and Yuwen Shiji. During the ongoing battle, Li Shimin sent Yuchi Jingde—who was still fully armed—into the Palace City to announce the news of the situation to Emperor Gaozu. Emperor Gaozu asked what was disturbing the peace and why he came. Yuchi Jingde replied: [...] "The Crown Prince and the Prince of Qi committed treason. The Prince of Qin mobilized his troops and executed them. He feared that Your Imperial Majesty would be shocked and he sent me to protect you." [...] Emperor Gaozu accepted the answer that he received from Yuchi Jingde. Subsequently, as the Zizhi Tongjian states, Emperor Gaozu turned to his officials and asked them: [...] "I did not anticipate that today I should see such a thing as this. What ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> it?" [...] Two of them spoke highly meritoriously of Li Shimin and said that the killings of the two princely brothers served as a punishment. They also recommended Emperor Gaozu to appoint Li Shimin as the heir apparent.|$|E
2500|$|Stevens {{returned}} to the United States in March 1908 to visit his family in Washington, D.C. and vacation with his sisters at a cottage they owned in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Upon his arrival, he gave {{an interview with a}} San Francisco newspaper in which he stated that the common people of Korea were benefiting from the increasing Japanese presence and protection in their country, and that, in the state that Korea was in, Korea was not fit to be a liberated country. These statements provoked the ire of two local associations of Koreans, the Daedong Bogukhoe and the Independence Club, who held a joint meeting in which they agreed that something had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>about</b> Stevens. On March 22, 1908, four Korean men chosen by the associations accosted Stevens at the Fairmont Hotel, where he was staying. Their leader, a {{man by the name of}} Earl Lee who was described as fluent in English, asked him if he had indeed made the statements attributed to him in the newspaper, and whether [...] "Japanese were not killing off the Koreans". He answered yes to the first question and no to the second, then proceeded to tell Lee that he had [...] "probably been too long away from his country to know the exact condition of the Government." [...] Upon this, the four men began to strike Stevens with chairs, knocking him down and causing him to strike his head against the marble flooring; Stevens backed up against the wall until help arrived. After the assault, Lee was quoted as saying, [...] "We are all very sorry that we did not do more to him." ...|$|E

Frank Cullotta was the leader, operating in Las Vegas. The burglary group became known in the media as the [...] "Hole in the Wall Gang" [...] because of it's skill in smashing entry holes through exterior walls or cutting through the roof of buildings during their burglaries. They committed many high end burglaries, and made large amounts of money. On July 4, 1981, most of the HITWG gang was arrested during a well planned burglary at Bertha's Gifts and Furnishings on Sahara Blvd. Bertha's was a very large store with 35 employees, and <b>was</b> estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>about</b> 15 {{million dollars a year}} in gross sales.

40|$|Much {{research}} exists about South African learners’ low {{literacy and}} numeracy levels and about poorly performing schools. In contrast, {{there are far}} fewer detailed descriptions of instructional practices and what teachers <b>are</b> actually <b>doing</b> in their classrooms, and far less evidence exists of in-depth research attempts to understand in what way and why teachers may experience problems with the teaching of reading literacy, particularly reading comprehension. This article aims to contribute to narrowing that gap by reviewing recent South African research on classroom comprehension instruction and obtaining information from teachers about how they perceive themselves as readers, what their teaching context is, what they claim <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> <b>about</b> reading in their classrooms, and to match these responses with ANA results at their schools. Data were obtained through a quantitative questionnaire from 159 teachers at 30 schools across three provinces. The results show that many teachers are not themselves immersed in rich reading practices, many teachers claim <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>doing</b> more than <b>is</b> reflected in their schools’ literacy results, and in general teachers don’t {{seem to have a}} clear understanding of reading concepts, reading development and reading methodology...|$|R
