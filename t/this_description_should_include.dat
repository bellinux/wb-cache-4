This simplification was made possible by the reduction of the β-turn structure into two conformationally invariant units, the median geometries of which are reported herein. <b>This</b> <b>description</b> <b>should</b> prove particularly useful in the development and application of novel peptide mimetic drugs, compounds for which a classification based on a peptide backbone geometry may be entirely irrelevant...|$|R
40|$|Charge state {{effects are}} known to be {{important}} for particle induced electron emission. Indeed, the charge state of the incident beam has a strong effect on the emission yields. Incident neutral hydrogen atoms can induce secondary electrons after an electron loss process. At high impact energies (above 200 keV) target electrons are excited by both the proton and the electron which can be treated in a first approximation as independent "primary particles". A more precise <b>description</b> <b>should</b> <b>include</b> different microscopic processes: (i) target electron excitation by the undissociated neutral H 0; (ii) excitation of the projectile electron by the loss process accompanied by target electron excitation; (iii) excitation of target electrons by the proton and the electron.

40|$|The {{alertness}} {{of individuals}} with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities is a recurring issue for both researchers and direct support persons. A literature review reveals that alertness is an ambiguous concept, and information about environmental conditions that may {{have an impact on}} alertness is lacking. However, joint agreement about the concept is important for researchers and DSPs. To generate an expert discussion we employed the method of Concept Mapping. Two Concept Maps were developed based on the following two questions: How can we describe alertness for individuals in the target group? What are the environmental conditions that can have an impact on alertness? The first map shows that <b>descriptions</b> <b>should</b> <b>include</b> a behavioral and an internal aspect of alertness.

40|$|AbstractThe β-turn is {{a common}} {{secondary}} structure in biologically active peptides and globular proteins, where it is widely thought {{to serve as a}} molecular recognition site for many biological processes. Although the primary β-turn recognition requirements are thought to be straightforward, relating mainly to the relative positions of the peptide sidechains, current classifications of β-turns are complex and are based solely upon the very variable geometry of the peptide backbone. We demonstrate here that β-turns can be described in terms of a single dihedral angle, which we have called β, which provides a complete description of the spatial relationship between the entry and exit peptide bonds as well as the relative orientations of the intervening sidechains for any β-turn. <b>This</b> <b>description</b> <b>should</b> prove particularly useful in the development and application of novel peptide mimetic drugs, compounds for which a classification based on a peptide backbone geometry may be entirely irrelevant...|$|R

40|$|The {{characterization}} of palaeospecies typically relies on hard-tissue anatomy, such as bones or teeth {{that is more}} readily fossilized than soft parts. Among dinosaurs, skin impressions are commonly associated with partial and complete hadrosaurid skeletons, and consist of non-imbricating tubercles or scales. Skin impressions from {{various parts of the}} body of two species of the hadrosaurine Saurolophus (S. angustirostris from Mongolia and S. osborni from Canada) are described from multiple specimens. These species, recently validated on osteological grounds, can be differentiated based solely on soft-tissue anatomy, namely scale shape and pattern. This study demonstrates {{for the first time the}} applicability of softtissue (i. e., scale impressions) as a means to differentiate species within the Dinosauria. Differences are most spectacular in the tail, where S. angustirostris is differentiated by the presence of vertical bands of morphologically distinct scales, a gridlike arrangement of circular feature-scales, and tabular scales along the dorsal midline. Preliminary results indicate scale architecture remained consistent throughout ontogeny in S. angustirostris.

This generalization is used to extend a previous treatment of ambipolar diffusion in two-temperature multicomponent plasmas [J. D. Ramshaw and C. H. Chang, Plasma Chem.

General expressions are thereby derived for the species diffusion fluxes, including thermal diffusion, in both single- and two-temperature multicomponent magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). It is shown that the usual zerofield form of the Stefan-Maxwell equations can be preserved {{in the presence of}} B by introducing generalized binary diffusion tensors dependent on B. A self-consistent effective binary diffusion approximation is presented that provides explicit approximate expressions for the diffusion fluxes.
