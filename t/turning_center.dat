50|$|The {{advent of}} the CNC lathe (or more properly, CNC <b>turning</b> <b>center)</b> has blurred these {{distinct}} levels of production to some extent. The CNC <b>turning</b> <b>center</b> most appropriately fits in the mid-range of production, replacing the turret lathe. However, it is often possible to produce a single component with a CNC <b>turning</b> <b>center</b> more quickly than {{can be done with}} an engine lathe. To some extent too, the CNC <b>turning</b> <b>center</b> has stepped into the region traditionally occupied by the (mechanical) screw machine. CNC screw machines do this to an even greater degree, but they are expensive. In some cases they are vital, yet in others a mechanical machine can match or beat overall performance and profitability. It is not unusual for cam-op automatic lathes to beat CNCs on cycle time. CNC offers many benefits, not least CAD/CAM integration, but the CNC itself usually does not give any inherent speed advantage within the context of an automatic lathe cycle in terms of speeds and feeds or tool-changing speed. There are many variables involved in answering the question of which is best for a particular part at a particular company. (Overhead is part of the calculation—not least because most cam-op machines are long since paid for, whereas a late-model CNC machine has hefty monthly payments). Businesses relying on cam-op machines are still competing even in today's CNC-filled environment; they just need to be vigilant and smart about keeping it that way.|$|E

50|$|Holzapfel’s {{trajectory}} parallels {{that of many}} {{makers of}} the period: she first sold work out of her studio, exhibited in the 1980s at small to modest craft fairs, and then at venues such as the American Craft Council shows in Baltimore and Springfield, Massachusetts, and the Philadelphia Craft Show. As the gallery system for contemporary crafts developed in the 1980s, dealers such as Betty Tinlot of Ten Arrow Gallery in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Ruth and Rick Snyderman of The Works Gallery in Philadelphia; and Bebe Pritam and Warren Eames Johnson of Pritam & Eames on Long Island discovered Holzapfel and gave her gallery exposure. She {{was one of the}} first turners featured at Philadelphia’s prestigious Wood <b>Turning</b> <b>Center</b> (now The Center for Art In Wood), where she remains an active participant. By 1991, Holzapfel was the only turner to be highlighted in the distinguished Peter Joseph Gallery in New York that specialized in handcrafted furniture. After the gallery closed in 1997, Holzapfel’s work was sold by such highly respected dealers as Barry Friedman Ltd. in New York and the Connell Gallery in Atlanta. Michelle is currently represented by Mitchell-Giddings Fine Art in Brattleboro, VT.|$|E
5000|$|Woodturning {{has always}} had a strong {{hobbyist}} presence. In the 1970s, an explosion of interest in hobby woodturning in the English-speaking world sparked a revival in the craft. Dr. Dale Nish travelled to England to recruit teachers, tools, and techniques from the last of the apprentice-trained woodturners. A few years later, Canadian Stephen Hogbin spent a year in Australia, pushing the limits of the craft through changes in scale and design. Industrial arts teachers used their institutional affiliation to create seminars, publish books, and foster research. The tool industry identified a new market for lathes and turning tools. A small group of serious collectors invested in the increasingly sculptural explorations of woodturners. It is unusual that woodturning never established a strong foothold in university departments of art and design. Instead, practitioners of the craft have become adept at learning from demonstrations, private classes, regional meetings, their own published journals, and internet technologies. Some artists began as woodturners, and moved into more sculptural work, experimenting with super object forms and other fine craft concepts. The Center for Art in Wood, founded in 1986 as The Wood <b>Turning</b> <b>Center,</b> houses a collection in Philadelphia with over 1,000 objects from international artists [...] as well as a research library and gallery. [...] Other turners have chosen an artisan-based focus on traditional work, custom work, and the pleasure of studio practice.|$|E

The measuring system consists of a signal generator, control electronics, a 15 MHz transducer and a PC system for data acquisition and evaluation. It is operated in the impulse-echo mode with a burst signal of 20 sine periods and uses the metal working fluid of the <b>turning</b> <b>center</b> as the coupling fluid for the sound propagation between transducer and ring.

40|$|A new {{generation}} of Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines, called four-axis <b>turning</b> <b>centers</b> has emerged and has been growing in use due to its versatility. Multiple turrets and spindles, automated material handling, and mill/turn capabilities on these machines enhance their processing capacity and lead to substantial improvement both in quality and productivity for turned components. However, optimal process planning on these machines is considerably complicated by their improved capabilities. No current commercial Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP) systems have considered constraint generation or process plan optimization for this class of machines. In this paper, the optimal process planning problem for four- axis <b>turning</b> <b>centers</b> is formulated as a Mixed- Integer Programming (MIP) model. The formulation is coded in GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System) modeling language and the Branch- and- Bound (BB) algorithm is used to solve the problem.

40|$|Abstract — Diamond, {{because of}} its high modulus of elasticity, {{chemical}} inertness and exceptionally high hardness, is ideal for obtaining fine surface finish and accuracy. Today’s requirement of high precision parts like magnetic memory device, laser equipment, electrostatic copier, printing machine, etc., made of non-ferrous materials, such as aluminum, copper and resin demands very high surface finish. The Polycrystalline Diamond (PCD) tool is suitable for such precision machining {{because of its}} low affinity to these materials and sharp cutting edges. PCD tools {{also can be used}} for machining of carbon, ceramics, glass, reinforced plastics, rubbers, plastics and resins, aluminum oxide, etc. In this paper, Response Surface Methodology is used to make a predictive mathematical model of surface roughness for aluminum turned using PCD tool on a CNC <b>turning</b> <b>center.</b> This model can be used for selecting the values of process variables namely work piece rpm, feed and depth of cut to get the desired value of the response i. e. surface finish within the range of experimentation.

40|$|Abstract. Thermally induced {{errors and}} {{geometric}} errors {{are two main}} sources that affect the machine tool accuracy when machining. In the last decade, real time compensation method had received wide attention {{for its ability to}} reduce the thermal error cost–effectively. Although real-time thermal error compensation techniques have been successfully demonstrated in laboratories, several difficulties hinder its widespread application. The selection of temperature variables and the setup of the error measurement system are the most critical ones among these difficulties. In this paper, a new on line measurement system and a new model that predicts the thermal error of a <b>turning</b> <b>center</b> are developed. The on-line measurement system using a Renishaw’s LT 02 S probe system is capable of measuring thermal error of a CNC <b>turning</b> <b>center</b> in real cutting conditions. The neural network uses the cutting conditions as the mapping inputs to avoid problems occurred in the traditional temperature-error mapping model. Results show the proposed measurement system and prediction model can be used to accurately estimate the thermally induced error in real cutting conditions...|$|E

40|$|Small soluble oligomers, and dimers in particular, of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) are {{believed}} {{to play an important}} pathological role in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we investigate the spontaneous dimerization of Aβ 42, with 42 residues, by implicit solvent all-atom Monte Carlo simulations, for the wild-type peptide and the mutants F 20 E, E 22 G and E 22 G/I 31 E. The observed dimers of these variants share many overall conformational characteristics but differ in several aspects at a detailed level. In all four cases, {{the most common type of}} secondary structure is intramolecular antiparallel β-sheets. Parallel, in-register β-sheet structure, as in models for Aβ fibrils, is rare. The primary force driving the formation of dimers is hydrophobic attraction. The conformational differences that we do see involve <b>turns</b> <b>centered</b> in the 20 – 30 region. The probability of finding <b>turns</b> <b>centered</b> in the 25 – 30 region, where there is a loop in Aβ fibrils, is found to increase upon dimerization and to correlate with experimentally measured rates of fibril formation for the different Aβ 42 variants.
