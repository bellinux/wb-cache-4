5|$|Later that year, Rindt drove, {{again in}} a Ferrari 250LM, at the 500 {{kilometre}} race at Zeltweg. He was able to win ahead of the better powered Ferrari of Mike Parkes owing to a special lever that manually activated the brake lights. Using the tool shortly before his actual braking point, Rindt was able to force Parkes <b>to</b> <b>brake</b> earlier than him which allowed him to stay ahead.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} session of Friday afternoon, Nico Rosberg topped the timesheets, setting a time of 1m41.983s, {{finishing}} more than {{a tenth of a}} second ahead of Hamilton. Third fastest was Sergio PÃ©rez for Force India, although he was unable to run in the last twenty minutes of the session due <b>to</b> <b>brake</b> issues. The Red Bull drivers Kvyat and Ricciardo were fourth and sixth respectively, while Fernando Alonso came within one second of Rosberg's time in ninth.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to replace the standard diode-bridge rectifier with a bi-directional IGBT switching device bridge mirroring the standard inverter which uses IGBT switching device output to the motor. Such rectifiers are referred to by various designations including active infeed converter (AIC), active rectifier, IGBT supply unit (ISU), active front end (AFE), or four-quadrant operation. With PWM control and a suitable input reactor, an AFE's AC line current waveform can be nearly sinusoidal. AFE inherently regenerates energy in four-quadrant mode from the DC side to the AC grid. Thus, no braking resistor is needed, and {{the efficiency of the}} drive is improved if the drive is frequently required <b>to</b> <b>brake</b> the motor.|$|E

5|$|The agents {{interview}} Tony Fiore, the ex-partner of Morris, who attributes Morris' {{death to}} a triad gang {{they had been}} investigating together. Later that day, Fiore meets with a Leon Felder, and the two discuss claiming a large sum of money from a safety deposit box, but agree that they haven't waited the ten years they had intended to, ominously discussing {{that they are the}} last two claimants left. That night, Felder gets off a bus, but his scarf catches in the door, seemingly moved by an invisible force, as the bus drives off. The driver tries <b>to</b> <b>brake,</b> but the bus inexplicably continues to accelerate, strangling Felder as Michelle watches from inside the bus.|$|E
5|$|With a VFD, the {{stopping}} {{sequence is}} just the opposite as the starting sequence. The frequency and voltage applied to the motor are ramped down at a controlled rate. When the frequency approaches zero, the motor is shut off. A small amount of braking torque is available to help decelerate the load a little faster than it would stop if the motor were simply switched off and allowed to coast. Additional braking torque {{can be obtained by}} adding a braking circuit (resistor controlled by a transistor) to dissipate the braking energy. With a four-quadrant rectifier (active front-end), the VFD is able <b>to</b> <b>brake</b> the load by applying a reverse torque and injecting the energy back to the AC line.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, 1960, was a {{bad year}} for the carrier's air group, with four Sea Venoms and two Gannets damaged in separate incidents aboard Melbourne. All four Sea Venom incidents occurred in March, with three attributed to aircrew error and one <b>to</b> <b>brake</b> failure. The year began with exercises en route to Adelaide, followed by {{a visit to the}} Royal Hobart Regatta. The carrier's Strategic Reserve deployment ran from April to June, and was followed by manoeuvres along the east coast of Australia until September. In the lead up to Melbournes 1961 deployment to the Strategic Reserve, the carrier visited Bombay, Karachi, and Trincomalee. It was the first time a flagship of the RAN had entered Indian waters. Melbourne returned to Australia in June, and on 15 June led several ships in a ceremonial entry to Sydney Harbour to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the RAN. In August, Melbourne was called upon to lead Exercise Tuckerbox, in the Coral Sea. Following the conclusion of Tuckerbox, the carrier visited several New Zealand ports before returning to Sydney for demonstration exercises and public relations activities.|$|E

50|$|<b>To</b> {{apply the}} <b>brakes</b> <b>to</b> {{all of the}} cars {{at about the same}} time, {{pressure}} is released from the train pipe, causing the triple valve on each car <b>to</b> apply the <b>brakes.</b> <b>To</b> release the <b>brakes</b> on each car, pressure is increased in the train pipe until an excess pressure above that of the pressure in each auxiliary cylinder is reached, which throws the triple valve so as to close the inlet <b>to</b> the <b>brake</b> cylinder and open the inlet to the auxiliary reservoir from the train pipe, thus allowing the equilibrium of the two pressures to be reached.|$|R

25|$|With {{hand-operated}} brakes, {{force is}} applied <b>to</b> <b>brake</b> levers mounted on the handlebars and transmitted via Bowden cables or hydraulic lines to the friction pads, which apply pressure to the braking surface, causing friction which slows the bicycle down. A rear hub brake may be either hand-operated or pedal-actuated, as in the back pedal coaster brakes which were popular in North America until the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|Multiple aspect signals, by {{providing}} several intermediate speed stages between 'clear' and 'on', allow high-speed trains sufficient time <b>to</b> <b>brake</b> safely if required. This becomes very important as train speeds rise. Without multiple-aspect signals, the stop signals {{must be placed}} far apart to allow sufficient braking distance and this reduces track utilisation. At the same time, slower trains can also be run closer together on track with multiple aspect signals.|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} made to {{evaluate}} the elastic behavior of a braked rolling tire and to relate this behavior to the tire characteristics obtained from simple static flexure tests.

The results of this investigation indicate that the elastic response of an aircraft tire <b>to</b> <b>braking</b> forces can be defined by the displacement distribution along the tire periphery and by the fore-and-aft spring constant. Changes in the rolling radius due <b>to</b> <b>braking</b> can be predicted with reasonable accuracy from elastic measurements of the static free-tread periphery or from elastic measurements within the footprint during low-speed braking, assuming there is no slippage between the tire and the pavement. The results of these tests further indicate that what was heretofore considered as pure tire slippage under braked-rolling conditions may be wholly or in part the result of tire elasticity. The elasticity {{must be considered in}} the design or application of efficient automatic braking systems. Includes bibliographical references (p. 30).

25|$|A T Tauri star {{is a type}} of preâmain {{sequence}} {{star that}} is being heated through gravitational contraction and has not yet begun to burn hydrogen at its core. They are variable stars that are magnetically active. The magnetic field of these stars is thought to interact with its strong stellar wind, transferring angular momentum to the surrounding protoplanetary disk. This allows the star <b>to</b> <b>brake</b> its rotation rate as it collapses.|$|E
25|$|ESC {{incorporates}} {{yaw rate}} control into the {{anti-lock braking system}} (ABS). Yaw is a rotation around the vertical axis; i.e. spinning left or right. Anti-lock brakes enable ESC <b>to</b> <b>brake</b> individual wheels. Many ESC systems also incorporate a traction control system (TCS or ASR), which senses drive-wheel slip under acceleration and individually brakes the slipping wheel or wheels and/or reduces excess engine power until control is regained. However, ESC serves a different purpose from that of ABS or Traction Control.|$|E
