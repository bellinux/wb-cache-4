5|$|A {{cigarette}} company, the British Great Auk Cigarettes, {{was named}} after <b>this</b> <b>bird.</b>|$|E
5|$|In some areas, {{introduced}} {{black and}} brown rats raid nests for eggs and young. Cats also threaten the red-billed tropicbird. <b>This</b> <b>bird</b> {{is considered to}} be a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though populations are thought to be declining. In some places, such as Brazil and Mexico, <b>this</b> <b>bird</b> {{is considered to be}} threatened.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientific}} {{journal of}} the American Ornithologists' Union is named The Auk in honour of <b>this</b> <b>bird.</b>|$|E

5|$|As the long-tailed {{ground roller}} is remarkably silent and {{difficult}} to see during the non-breeding season, the local inhabitants of Madagascar once believed that <b>this</b> <b>bird</b> hibernated in its burrows. While not particularly tasty, this species is hunted for food due to its large size and the relative ease of capture compared with arboreal birds. In the early twentieth century, it was hunted by herdsmen with blowguns. In the 1950s and 1960s, natives trapped this ground roller and dug out its nesting burrows. <b>This</b> <b>bird</b> has been featured on several of Madagascar's stamps. Only one zoo, Germany's Weltvogelpark Walsrode, keeps this species. It is considered by birdwatchers {{to be one of}} the world's most elusive birds.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>bird's</b> call {{is a low}} {{repeated}} grunt transcribed as kek-kek-kek.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>bird's</b> {{common name}} commemorates the Dutch naturalist Coenraad Jacob Temminck.|$|R
50|$|The {{discussion}} about <b>this</b> <b>bird's</b> identity reopened {{the debate about}} the Druridge bird.|$|R
5|$|In the Northern Hemisphere, <b>this</b> <b>bird</b> breeds from April to August. In east Africa, the {{breeding}} season {{is at least}} from January to February, while in southern Africa, {{the breeding}} season is from October to April.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} {{was introduced}} to Jamaica in 1903, and the Bahamas and Cuba were colonised naturally from the US. <b>This</b> <b>bird</b> is fairly common but local in Jamaica, Grand Bahama and Bimini, and is rare {{in the rest of}} the Bahamas, eastern Cuba, the Cayman Islands, Puerto Rico and St. Croix.|$|E
5|$|The grey-necked wood rail is {{the type}} host of Plasmodium bertii, an apicomplexan parasite, meaning that P. bertii was {{originally}} discovered on this organism. P. lutzi is also found on <b>this</b> <b>bird.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>bird's</b> song is a sneezed fitz-bew. The call is a dry whit.|$|R

5|$|The {{northern}} mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos) {{is the only}} mockingbird commonly found in North America. <b>This</b> <b>bird</b> is mainly a permanent resident, but northern birds may move south during harsh weather. This species has rarely been observed in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The winter diet {{is mainly}} plant {{material}} including seeds and rhizomes of aquatic plants, but the pintail sometimes feeds on roots, grain and other seeds in fields, though less frequently than other Anas ducks. During the nesting season, <b>this</b> <b>bird</b> eats mainly invertebrate animals, including aquatic insects, molluscs and crustaceans.|$|E
5|$|There are two sanctuaries {{dedicated}} to <b>this</b> <b>bird,</b> the Sisquoc Condor Sanctuary in the San Rafael Wilderness and the Sespe Condor Sanctuary in the Los Padres National Forest. These areas were chosen {{because of their}} prime condor nesting habitat.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>bird's</b> {{common name}} and Latin {{binomial}} commemorate the Dutch naturalist Coenraad Jacob Temminck.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>bird's</b> {{numbers are}} declining due to habitat loss largely {{attributed}} to human activity.|$|R

5|$|<b>This</b> <b>bird</b> {{can be seen}} to perch in both {{shrubbery}} {{and even}} trees, something characteristic of the forest rails. The grey-necked wood rail rarely flies, although when it is flushed out, it will generally move to a branch close to the ground. If it is being observed, it is generally cautious.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>bird</b> is {{classified}} as vulnerable by the IUCN and is threatened by habitat destruction. Since the arid, spiny forests in which it lives are not protected by the Malagasy government, it is losing habitat to slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal collection, and logging. It is also hunted by the native peoples of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>bird</b> {{with its}} somehow crow-like aspect gave {{foot to the}} naming of the Quebrada de los Cuervos (Crows Ravine) in Uruguay, where they dwell {{together}} with the black vulture and the turkey vulture.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>bird's</b> {{numbers have}} {{declined}} due to habitat loss {{in some parts}} of its range.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>bird's</b> {{numbers are}} declining {{in the eastern}} parts of its range due to habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>bird's</b> song is a sweet high warble {{descending}} {{in pitch}} and becoming buzzy near the finish.|$|R
5|$|Throughout its {{historic}} range, the California condor {{has been a}} popular subject of mythology and an important symbol to Native Americans. Unusually, <b>this</b> <b>bird</b> takes on different roles in the storytelling of the different tribes.|$|E
5|$|Accurate {{assessment}} of red-billed tropicbird numbers is difficult {{due to the}} remote locations of nesting sites and vast areas of sea they might be found. <b>This</b> <b>bird</b> {{is considered to be}} a least-concern species according to the IUCN. This is due to the fact that the range, declination, and numbers of this species, although small, do not meet the criteria required to be considered a vulnerable species. The range of this species is believed to be , with an estimated 3,300 to 13,000 mature individuals. In the western Atlantic, a more precise number was given for the population there in 2000; about 4,000 to 5,000 pairs. The population is declining, mainly due to human exploitation of the bird's environment and predation by invasive species, such as rats. These predators have the potential to drive populations of the red-billed tropicbird into serious decline. It is estimated that <b>this</b> <b>bird</b> experienced a population bottleneck about 450 to 750 years ago, likely due to exploitation by humans. This has resulted in low genetic diversity in this tropicbird, which makes the likelihood of it adapting to sudden environmental changes low. In Mexico and Brazil, it is considered to be threatened.|$|E
5|$|Although {{numbers have}} {{declined}} steeply in western Europe, <b>this</b> <b>bird</b> is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List {{because of its}} huge range and large, apparently stable, populations in Russia and Kazakhstan. Numbers in western China are more significant than previously thought, and conservation measures have facilitated an increased population in some countries which had suffered the greatest losses. Despite its elusive nature, the loud call has ensured the corn crake has been noted in literature, and garnered a range of local and dialect names.|$|E
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>bird's</b> song is a harsh jeeb, {{and it has}} {{a variety}} of {{typically}} grackle-like chatters and squeaks.|$|R

50|$|<b>This</b> <b>bird's</b> song is a {{beautiful}} rich and varied whistle, shee-vee-li-ee-ree, and call is a high thin seet or whooeet.|$|R
