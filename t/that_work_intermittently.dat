5000|$|Newton {{was founded}} in 1850 and {{incorporated}} as a city in 1857. In the late 19th century, Newton's growth was fueled {{by the development of}} coal mines in the region. The first significant mine in the area was the Couch mine of the Jasper County Coal and Railway Company, opened in the 1870s. It was, for a while, the largest mine in the county, producing 70 tons per day. William Snooks opened a mine near Newton in 1886. [...] In the early 20th century, large scale mining in the Newton area had declined, but there were still several mines in the area <b>that</b> were <b>worked</b> <b>intermittently.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Superheating was an {{innovation}} {{at this time}} and not yet firmly established, mostly owing to difficulties in providing adequate cylinder lubrication. Hughes was an advocate of superheating and used it when rebuilding the 7'3" [...] Class 4 express 4-4-0s, fitting Schmidt superheaters and piston valves, along with Walschaerts valve gear. Despite this, he recognised <b>that</b> an <b>intermittently</b> <b>worked</b> shunting engine such as the 0-8-2Ts would not allow the superheater elements to reach their optimum working temperature, and so retained a simpler saturated boiler.|$|R
50|$|Anthony {{was born}} in New York. Jacob Anthony, his father, was for many years one of the {{principal}} bank tellers in The United States Branch Bank and cashier of the old Bank of the State of New York. The family derives their descent from Allard Anthony, an immigrant from Holland to New Amsterdam about 1628, {{who was one of the}} first five councilmen of the new colony. In 1828, Henry Anthony entered the Columbia College and graduated with honors four years later. After <b>that,</b> he <b>worked</b> <b>intermittently</b> as a civil engineer, at the Erie railroad, Croton Aqueduct and Hudson River railroad, and as a clerk at the Bank of New York. In 1839 he became interested in the new art of photography, which he learned along with his brother Edward. Soon after Edward established his photography firm, Henry joined him in 1852, the firm becoming the E. & H. T. Anthony & Company. In 1877, the firm was reorganized as a corporation, with Edward as president, Henry as vice-president, and Colonel V. M. Wilcox as manager and secretary. After the death of both brothers, Wilcox became president, Richard A. Anthony (son of Edward Anthony) vice-president, and Frederick A. Anthony the secretary.|$|R
2500|$|The fourth phase, {{known as}} the [...] "Quiet Revolution", {{began in the late}} 1970s and {{continues}} on today. Beginning in the 1970s women began to flood colleges and grad schools. They began to enter profession like medicine, law, dental and business. More women were going to college and expected to be employed at the age of 35, as opposed to past generations <b>that</b> only <b>worked</b> <b>intermittently</b> due to marriage and childbirth. This increase in expectations of long-term gainful employment is reflected in the change of majors adopted by women from the 1970s on. The percentage of women majoring in education declined beginning in the 1970s; education was once a popular major for women since it allowed them to step {{into and out of the}} labor force when they had children and when their children grew up to a reasonable age at which their mothers did not have to serve primarily as caretakers. Instead, majors such as business and management were on the rise in the 1970s, as women ventured into other fields that were once predominated by men. They experienced an expansion of their horizons and an alteration of what it meant to define their own identity. Women worked before they got married, and since women were marrying younger they were able to define themselves prior to a serious relationship. Research indicates that from 1965 to 2002, the increase in women’s labor force participation more than offset the decline for men.|$|R
