5000|$|Though TAAS {{is mostly}} similar to FPGA {{in terms of}} {{operation}} principles, they differ primarily in three aspects: i) for TAAS computation payload [...] is extracted from system code + system <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> and then directly compiled to configurable hardware resources; whereas FPGA usually involves a manual engineering step by first develop HDL design such as Verilog RTL. Thus FPGA design {{is the same as}} ASIC design until synthesis and P&R step; 2) TAAS is able to explore full design space because it has complete system knowledge (system code + system <b>test</b> <b>benches),</b> whereas FPGA has HDL design as the input leaving design space exploration only available at the last step which is synthesis and P&R; iii) TAAS is transistor-level reconfigurable and FPGA is configurable at logic block level and thus hardware overhead for TAAS is much smaller than FPGA. Smaller granularity of configurability in the case of TAAS allows full design space exploration. In general, TAAS can achieve much more efficient implementation than FPGA in terms of overall transistor utilization rate and hence total number of transistors required to run system functionalities.|$|E
40|$|Passive damping is used {{to reduce}} {{vibrations}} of machining tools. The drawback with the passive damping system {{is that it is}} adjusted to damp out vibrations in one restricted frequency range. Active damping uses real time measurements to dampen the vibrations and is not tuned for one specific frequency range. Teeness AS {{wants to be able to}} investigate different ways of regulating an active damping system on a physical <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> and to investigate if an Arduino is suited for regulating the system. This paper presents the design development of the physical <b>test</b> <b>bench,</b> simulations of the designed <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> and an electrical setup with Arduino as the regulating controller. Actuators were evaluated and purchased. The <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> was designed to fit the actuators using Siemens NX as CAD program. The components of the <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> were produced by Teeness AS. Simulations of the designed <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> were conducted using FEDEM to investigate the dynamics of the system. Requirements for the Arduino were investigated and regulating scripts were coded, tested and evaluated. The simulated <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> was able to significantly reduce the vibrations investigated. However there were some behaviors of the simulated <b>test</b> <b>bench</b> that differ from the measurements made of the physical <b>test</b> <b>bench.</b> This was most likely a result of the modeling of actuators. The results from the simulations give an indication of the general behavior of the <b>test</b> <b>bench,</b> but the use of exact values should be avoided. To improve the validity of the simulations, further work with the simulation of the actuators should be conducted. Using an Arduino as a control mechanism seems promising, but further work needs to be done to reduce the noise of the sensor data and the regulating script presented in this paper should be improved...|$|R

50|$|In {{calibrating}} ECUs, control {{behavior is}} modified for different vehicle models or variants. This {{is not done}} by making changes to the program code, but instead by changing the ECU’s parameterization. This {{involves the use of}} measurement and calibration systems such as CANape in the laboratory, on <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> or in vehicles during test trials. To evaluate the effects of changes to parameters, development engineers access the relevant process variables with conventional measurement technology at sensors and actuators and read out the data from the ECU. Measured data internal to the ECU, e.g. intermediate results of a computational function, can be accessed via ASAM standard protocols XCP or CCP and the ECU’s standard interfaces (CAN, FlexRay, LIN, Ethernet/BroadR-Reach). For a high-performance ECU access, data from microcontroller-specific interfaces (for example JTAG, DAP, AURORA) can be converted via an external hardware (like Vector’s VX1000 system) in XCP on Ethernet. A typical use case for calibration with CANape is online calibration. This involves modifying parameters directly in the ECU. The resulting control characteristic can be measured and checked directly. Using this approach, measured data from the ECU or physical measurement variables on or in the vehicle can be precisely analyzed {{to determine the effects of}} each individual change.|$|E
5000|$|Within a {{few hours}} Lloyd had made an {{inspection}} tour of the airfields and the main workshops at Kalafrana. The state of the island was worse than he expected. The slackening of German air activity had allowed the number of aircraft to increase, but the RAF still had fewer than 60 machines of all types. Maintenance was difficult. Hardly any spare or replacement parts were available. Spares had to be obtained by sifting through the debris of wrecks or by cannibalising undamaged aircraft. Furthermore, the airfields were too small; there was no heavy equipment to work with; and even the commonest sorts of tools, such as hammers and wrenches, were all but impossible to find. All refuelling {{had to be done}} by hand from individual drums. The shelter was also inadequate, so there was little protection for what equipment they did have. Most aircraft were clustered together on open runways, presenting tempting targets. At Kalafrana, all the buildings were close together and above ground.

In {{the beginning of the}} thesis process, Sandvik had project plans on building new drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> for testing durability of new rock drill products in the product development stage. Durability testing involves long test runs where test phases are repeated several times. The new drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> required a new control system to be developed. The control system is an embedded system consisting of several components, some of which run the Linux operating system. Additionally, a desktop application needed to be developed for creating tests for the drill <b>test</b> <b>benches.</b> In this thesis a concept of a testing framework is created, which describes conceptually how the automatic tests for the drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> are defined and run. Applicability of the concept is analyzed also in a broader context for testing various kinds of systems. An implementation of the testing framework concept for drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> is developed, which is the main focus of this thesis. All levels of the control system are described briefly from both hardware and software perspectives. However, the thesis will not go into details of other software components beyond the testing framework since they were not implemented by the author. The project plans for building new drill <b>test</b> <b>benches</b> based on the new control system were cancelled late in the process of writing this thesis. Therefore, no feedback from production use was received. The control system can, however, be deployed later in new drill test bench projects or when an old drill test bench control system is updated. Based on current assessment, the project has achieved its goals. The new software used for creating tests has better usability than the one used in a previous drill test bench. Maintainability of the control system is also considerably better than in previous drill <b>test</b> <b>benches...</b>|$|E
