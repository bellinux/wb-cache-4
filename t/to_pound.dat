5|$|Dorothy soon fell in {{love with}} Pound. In late 1909 and early 1910 Olivia and Dorothy {{attended}} his lectures at the London Polytechnic Institution; in June 1910 they joined him in Sirmione, Italy. For reasons unclear to biographers Olivia forbade the two from writing to each other during his extended visit to New York from 1910-11. Despite the restriction Dorothy seems to have considered herself engaged <b>to</b> <b>Pound,</b> although uncertain whether he intended to stay in New York or return to London.|$|E
5|$|Eugène's {{artillery}} continued <b>to</b> <b>pound</b> Russian support columns, while Marshals Ney and Davout {{set up a}} crossfire with artillery {{positioned on}} the Semyonovskaya heights. Barclay countered by moving the Prussian General Eugen over {{to the right to}} support Miloradovich in his defense of the redoubt. The French responded to this move by sending forward General Sorbier, commander of the Imperial Guard artillery. Sorbier brought forth 36 artillery pieces from the Imperial Guard Artillery Park and also took command of 49 horse artillery pieces from Nansouty's Ist Cavalry Corps and La Tour Maubourg's IV Cavalry Corps, as well as of Viceroy Eugène's own artillery, opening up a massive artillery barrage.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 Yeats {{thought his}} {{horoscope}} suggested {{a return to}} Olivia; he distanced himself from Maud and in June began to see Olivia more frequently. Pound was fond of Olivia, which may have caused Yeats some jealousy as when, for example, Pound met the two at the theatre and took them afterward to tea—an occasion when Yeats was extremely rude <b>to</b> <b>Pound.</b> A year later, Olivia introduced Yeats to Georgie Hyde-Lees, her 18-year-old step-niece and Dorothy's best friend, whom Yeats eventually married.|$|E

5|$|On his 87th birthday, 30 October 1972, he was {{too weak}} to leave his bedroom. The next night he was {{admitted}} to the Civil Hospital of Venice, where he died in his sleep of an intestinal blockage on 1 November, with Olga at his side. Dorothy was unable to travel to the funeral. Four gondoliers dressed in black rowed the body to the island cemetery, Isola di San Michele, where he was buried near Diaghilev and Stravinsky. Dorothy died in England the following year. Olga died in 1996 and was buried next <b>to</b> <b>Pound.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pound {{was fascinated}} by the {{translations}} of Japanese poetry and Noh plays which he discovered in the papers of Ernest Fenollosa, an American professor who had taught in Japan. Fenollosa had studied Chinese poetry under Japanese scholars; in 1913 his widow, Mary McNeil Fenollosa, decided to give his unpublished notes <b>to</b> <b>Pound</b> after seeing his work; she was looking for someone who cared about poetry rather than philology. Pound edited and published Fenellosa's The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry in 1918.|$|E
5|$|As the Japanese ships {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>pound</b> the Tsesarevich, {{the battleship}} , followed shortly afterward by Peresvet, boldly charged Tōgō's battleline {{in an attempt}} to divert the Japanese shellfire. The Japanese battleline immediately shifted fire to the oncoming ships, badly damaging both and forcing them to turn away. Ukhtomsky signaled the other Russian ships to follow him back to Port Arthur, but the signal was hard to discern because the flags had to be hung from the bridge railings without the topmasts and were only gradually recognized. Peresvet received a total of 39 hits of all sizes that killed 13 men and wounded 69. Her forward 12-inch turret was knocked out and several hits near the waterline caused flooding; compartments of the double bottom had to be counterflooded to restore some of her stability. Repairs took until late September.|$|E

5|$|Finally, by 19:00 B Company {{was able}} break contact and withdrew after a five-hour battle, {{moving into a}} night harbour near the landing zone with the {{remainder}} of the battalion. Mortars, artillery fire and airstrikes covered the Australian withdrawal, and then proceeded <b>to</b> <b>pound</b> the battlefield into the evening. After a tense night the Australians returned the next morning only to find that the Viet Cong had left the area during the night, successfully avoiding a large blocking force while dragging most of their dead and wounded with them. A hard fought affair at close range, the Viet Cong had lost heavily during the fighting, yet the disciplined force had matched the Australians as both sides stood their ground, inflicting numerous casualties on the other before each fell back. Although 6 RAR had ultimately prevailed, if only by default, the vicious fighting at Ap My An was probably the closest that the Australian Army came to defeat in a major battle during the war.|$|E
5|$|His opponents {{learned from}} Napoleon's innovations. The {{increased}} importance of artillery after 1807 stemmed from his {{creation of a}} highly mobile artillery force, the growth in artillery numbers, and changes in artillery practices. As {{a result of these}} factors, Napoleon, rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy's defenses, now could use massed artillery as a spearhead <b>to</b> <b>pound</b> a break in the enemy's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry. McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and, later, France's inferiority in cavalry numbers. Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, but 18th-century operational mobility underwent change.|$|E
5|$|In June 1923, Hemingway took Hadley, with Robert McAlmon and Bird, to Spain {{where he}} found a new passion with his first visits to the bullfights. During the summer he wrote five new vignettes (chapters 12–16), all about bullfighting, {{finishing}} the last two on his return to Paris in August. That summer he also honed new narrative techniques in chapters 7–11. In August he reported <b>to</b> <b>Pound</b> {{that he was about}} to begin the last two pieces (chapters 17 and 18), implemented revisions that Pound suggested, and sent the manuscript to Bill Bird. Then he left Paris with Hadley (who was pregnant with their first child) for Toronto, where he was living when Bird finished producing the book.|$|E

5|$|It was at Pennsylvania in 1901 that Pound met Hilda Doolittle (later {{known as}} the poet H.D.), his first serious romance, {{according}} <b>to</b> <b>Pound</b> scholar Ira Nadel. In 1911 she followed Pound to London and became involved in developing the Imagism movement. Between 1905 and 1907 Pound wrote several poems for her, 25 of which he hand-bound and called Hilda's Book, and in 1908 he asked her father, the astronomy professor Charles Doolittle, for permission to marry her, but Doolittle dismissed Pound as a nomad. Pound was seeing two other women at the same time—Viola Baxter and Mary Moore—later dedicating a book of poetry, Personae (1909), to the latter. He asked Moore to marry him too, but she turned him down.|$|E
5|$|Finally, by 19:00 B Company {{was able}} break contact and withdrew after a five-hour battle. Both sides then fell {{back as the}} Viet Cong also dispersed, {{evacuating}} most of their dead and wounded. Meanwhile, under covering fire from the APCs of 2 Troop, B Company boarded the remaining carriers, moving into a night harbour near the landing zone with {{the remainder of the}} battalion at 19:25, as the last of their casualties were extracted by helicopter. Mortars, artillery fire and airstrikes covered the Australian withdrawal, and then proceeded <b>to</b> <b>pound</b> the abandoned battlefield into the evening. That night the body of the dead APC driver was evacuated by helicopter, as American AC-47 Spooky gunships circled overhead, dropping flares to illuminate the battlefield and strafing likely Viet Cong positions, while F-4 Phantoms dropped napalm. The airstrikes then continued in preparation for a further assault by the Australians planned for the following day. Otherwise there was no further fighting that night, and both sides remained unmolested. Ultimately no attack was made against the Australian base at Nui Dat that night either, while no unusual activity was reported in the area.|$|E
5|$|Pound's {{editorial}} {{choices were}} {{based on what he}} saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with Imagist precepts, rather than active participation in a group as such. Williams, who was based in the United States, had not participated in any of the discussions of the Eiffel Tower group. However, he and Pound had long been corresponding {{on the question of the}} renewal of poetry along similar lines. Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound, as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier, Pre-Raphaelite-influenced style towards a harder, more modern way of writing. The inclusion of a poem by Joyce, I Hear an Army, which was sent <b>to</b> <b>Pound</b> by W.B. Yeats, took on a wider importance in the history of literary modernism, as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication, at Pound's behest, of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The Egoist. Joyce's poem is not written in free verse, but in rhyming quatrains. However, it strongly reflects Pound's interest in poems written to be sung to music, such as those by the troubadours and Guido Cavalcanti. The book met with little popular or critical success, at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do, and a number of copies were returned to the publisher.|$|E

5|$|That year, H.D. {{attended}} Bryn Mawr College {{to study}} Greek literature, but left after only three terms due to poor grades and the excuse of poor health. While at the college, she met poets Marianne Moore and William Carlos Williams. Her first published writings, stories for children, {{were published in}} The Comrade, a Philadelphia Presbyterian Church paper, between 1909 and 1913, mostly under the name Edith Gray. In 1907, she became engaged <b>to</b> <b>Pound.</b> Her father disapproved of Pound, {{and by the time}} Pound left for Europe in 1908, the engagement had been called off. Around this time, H.D. started a relationship with a young female art student at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Frances Josepha Gregg. After spending part of 1910 living in Greenwich Village, she sailed to Europe with Gregg and Gregg's mother in 1911. In Europe, H.D. began a more serious career as a writer. Her relationship with Gregg cooled, and she met a writing enthusiast named Brigit Patmore with whom she became involved in an affair. Patmore introduced H.D. to another poet, Richard Aldington.|$|E
5|$|The 30th Infantry Division, with {{elements}} of the 29th Infantry and 2nd Armored divisions, continued its push southwards between 13–16 October, in the sector of the village of Würselen; however, even with heavy air support, they were unsuccessful in breaking through German defenses and linking up with allied forces to the south. The Germans {{took advantage of the}} narrow front <b>to</b> <b>pound</b> advancing attackers with artillery, and progress remained slow as German tanks used houses as bunkers to surprise and overwhelm American foot soldiers. General Hobbs, commander of the 30th Infantry Division, then attempted to outflank the German defenses by attacking along another sector with two infantry battalions. The attack was a success, allowing the 30th and 1st Infantry Divisions to link up on 16 October. The fighting had so far cost the American XIX Corps over 400 dead and 2,000 wounded, with 72% of those from the 30th Infantry Division. The Germans had not fared any better, as up to 14 October around 630 of their soldiers had been killed and 4,400 wounded; another 600 were lost in the 3rd Panzergrenadier Division's counterattack on the US 1st Infantry Division on 16 October.|$|E
5|$|The North Vietnamese 5th Battalion, 198th Special Forces Regiment {{continued}} their assault on South Vietnamese installations at Mai Hac De district and {{the headquarters of}} the ARVN 53rd Infantry Regiment. The 5th Battalion successfully overran the nearby South Vietnamese artillery position and the tactical operations centre, thereby establishing control over the battlefield. By 5am all main roads leading into the city of Ban Me Thuot were completely under North Vietnamese control. As the sun rose, the North Vietnamese continued <b>to</b> <b>pound</b> South Vietnamese positions around Ban Me Thuot with heavy artillery to cover the next wave of infantry assaults. During the morning of March 10, North Vietnamese infantry units attacked Ban Me Thuot from different directions along the main roads. The 174th Regiment, with one armoured battalion in support, marched through Chi Lang, Chu Di, and Mai Hac De from the northwest. As the 95B Regiment approached Ban Me Thuot from the northeast, the main formation of the 149th Regiment secured Chu Blom and marched towards Ban Me Thuot from the southeast. The 1st Battalion, 3rd Regiment and the 1st Battalion, 149th Regiment launched an assault on Hoa Binh airfield from the northeast and southwest respectively. At the same time, the 2nd Regiment captured the South Vietnamese installation at Phuoc An.|$|E
