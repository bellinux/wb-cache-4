50|$|James East first sought {{political}} {{office in the}} February 1912 municipal election, {{when he ran for}} alderman on the Edmonton City Council, finishing fifth of eighteen candidates. Unlike most of Edmonton's elections at the time, in which half of the aldermen were elected <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>year</b> terms (with the other half being elected <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>year</b> terms in intervening years) the recent amalgamation of Edmonton and Strathcona meant that all ten aldermen would be elected, five <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>year</b> terms and five to serve until the next election held late that same year. As a finisher in the top five, East would normally have been entitled to a two-year term; however the terms of the amalgamation specified that two of the aldermen elected <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>year</b> terms had <b>to</b> come from {{the south side of the}} North Saskatchewan River - where Strathcona was located - and there was only one such candidate (John Tipton) in the top five. Accordingly, Thomas J. Walsh - the second-place southside candidate, who had come in eighth - was elected to a two-year term, and East just for 1912.|$|R

5|$|The {{office of}} {{governor}} {{was established by}} the first New York State Constitution in 1777. The governor was originally for a term of three years, though the constitution did not specify when the term began. A 1787 law set {{the start of the}} term at July 1. The New York State Constitutional Convention of 1821 amended the state constitution, reducing the term of office <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> moving the election to November, and moving {{the beginning and the end}} of the term to coincide with the calendar year. An 1874 amendment extended the term of office back to three years, but the 1894 constitution again reduced it <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>years.</b> The most recent constitution of 1938 extended the term to the current four years. There is no limit to the number of consecutive terms a governor may serve.|$|E

As the top five finishers in the election {{were expected to be}} elected <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>year</b> terms with the next five being elected to one year terms, this would normally have resulted in Walsh being required to seek re-election in the next election. However, the terms of the amalgamation between Edmonton and Strathcona, which had been effected days before the election (with Walsh's support), required that two of the five councillors elected <b>to</b> <b>two</b> <b>year</b> terms come from {{the south side of the}} North Saskatchewan River, which Walsh, unlike six of the candidates to finish ahead of him, did; accordingly, he was elected <b>to</b> a <b>two</b> <b>year</b> term, while fifth place finisher James East received only one year.
