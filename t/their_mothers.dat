5|$|Cubs start {{following}} <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> at six weeks. The mother frequently {{shifts the}} cubs to new locations. A study of play behaviour of cheetah cubs showed that cubs tend to play after nursing or {{while they are}} on the move with <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> Play involves plenty of agility; attacks are seldom lethal. Playing cubs stay near <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> The study further revealed that while the cubs showed improvement in catching each other as they grew up, the ability to crouch and hide did not develop remarkably. Thus, it was suggested that play helps develop only certain aspects of predator defence. Weaning occurs at three to six months of age. The mother brings kills to her cubs; the cubs might purr as the mother licks them clean after the meal. Cubs as young as six months try to capture small prey like hares and juvenile gazelles. However, they may have to wait until as long as 15 months of age to make a successful kill on their own.|$|E
5|$|During dispersal, females tend {{to settle}} in home ranges that overlap with <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> However, they {{do not seem to}} have any special social bonds with them. Males {{disperse}} much farther from <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> and enter into a transient phase. This phase lasts until a male can challenge and displace a dominant, resident male from his home range. Adult males dominate sub-adult males.|$|E
5|$|Matings are {{generally}} observed between March and May, {{but the most}} likely time of conception is April. Most mating {{takes place in the}} territories and during the day. Females have control over the copulation process, and males may have to keep mating with the same females. Females usually give birth to one young each year. Gestation lasts around 27 weeks, and pregnant females give birth between late September and November. Late births into January are sometimes observed. The altricial newborns rely on <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> for warmth. For their first three weeks, young cling to <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> when they go foraging. After this, the young remain in the roosts. By January, young are capable of sustained flight, and by February, March or April are fully weaned.|$|E

50|$|The average {{gestation}} {{period for the}} gray four-eyed opossum is 13 to 14 days, and each newborn weighs about 9 g. They nurse in <b>their</b> <b>mother's</b> pouch until they are 68 to 75 days old. Once weaned, they stay in <b>their</b> <b>mother's</b> nest for a further 8 to 15 days before <b>their</b> <b>mother</b> becomes aggressive and expels them.|$|R
5|$|Baby {{flying foxes}} usually come into care {{after having been}} {{separated}} from <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> Babies are often orphaned during {{four to six weeks}} of age, when they inadvertently fall off <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> during flight. When they are older, orphans usually come into care because of maternal death from power line electrocution or barbed wire entanglement. A rare, but apparent natural, occurrence of mass abandonment can lead to the rescue of hundreds of babies at one time. The latter most recently occurred in November 2008 at the Canungra bat camp in South East Queensland, when Wildcare Australia, working closely with the EPA and regional bat care groups, rescued and rehabilitated over 300 baby grey-headed flying foxes. Most babies are in a dehydrated and distressed state by the time they are rescued, and some are infested with maggots if found sick or injured. A young flying fox must be fed every four hours, and then as it develops it is introduced to blossoms and fruit. When the young flying fox is fully weaned around 10 to 12 weeks of age, it goes into a crèche for rehabilitation and eventual release.|$|E
5|$|Diseases, accidents, hunters, automobiles, and {{starvation}} are {{the other}} leading causes of death. Juveniles show high mortality shortly after leaving <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> while still perfecting their hunting techniques. One study of 15 bobcats showed yearly survival rates for both sexes averaged 0.62, in line with other research suggesting rates of 0.56 to 0.67. Cannibalism has been reported; kittens may be taken when prey levels are low, but this is very rare and does not much influence the population.|$|E
5|$|Following various {{military}} conquests in the Greek East, Romans adapted {{a number}} of Greek educational precepts to their own fledgling system. They began physical training to prepare the boys to grow as Roman citizens and for eventual recruitment into the army. Conforming to discipline was a point of great emphasis. Girls generally received instruction from <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> {{in the art of}} spinning, weaving, and sewing.|$|E

5|$|Gestational period varies among bovids - while duiker {{gestation}} {{ranges from}} 120 to 150 days, gestation in African buffalo ranges from 300 to 330 days. Usually, a single offspring is born (twins are less frequent), {{and it is}} able to stand and run by itself within an hour of birth. In monogamous species, males assist in defending their young, {{but that is not the}} case in polygynous species. Most newborn calves remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b> In some bovid species the neonates start following about <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> immediately or within a few days, as in the impala. Different bovids have different strategies for defence of juveniles. For instance, while wildebeest mothers solely defend their young, buffaloes exhibit collective defence. Weaning might occur as early as two months (as in royal antelope) or as late as a year (as in muskox).|$|E
5|$|In Heian-era Japan, {{husbands and}} wives kept {{separate}} households; children were raised with <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> although the patrilineal system was still followed. Murasaki was unconventional because she lived in her father's household, most likely on Teramachi Street in Kyoto, with her younger brother Nobunori. Their mother died, perhaps in childbirth, when the children were quite young. Murasaki had at least three half-siblings raised with their mothers; she {{was very close to}} one sister who died in her twenties.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{of these}} {{children}} were recognised by Belgrano in his will, where {{he said he had}} no children. However, it is thought that he did not mention them in order to protect <b>their</b> <b>mothers,</b> as both children were the result of relations that the moral standards of the society of the day would not have accepted. Nevertheless, he requested that his brother, Joaquín Eulogio Estanislao Belgrano, who was appointed as his heir, should look after his newborn daughter.|$|E

5|$|As {{he served}} his {{sentence}} in the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, friends and family continued to occupy some of Vick's other homes in the South Beach section of Miami Beach, Florida. In June 2008, when Vick's brother, Marcus, was arrested and jailed in Norfolk after a police chase, he listed his residence as a $1.39 million home owned by Vick in an exclusive riverfront community in Suffolk, Virginia. Construction of a new riverfront home took place on land Vick owned in another exclusive section of Suffolk. His attorneys later estimated that he was spending $30,000 a month to support seven friends and relatives, including his mother and brother, three children, and <b>their</b> <b>mothers.</b>|$|E
5|$|Athenian {{girls were}} not {{formally}} educated; instead, <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> taught them the domestic {{skills necessary for}} running a household. Formal education for boys consisted of rhetoric, necessary for effective political participation, and physical education in preparation for military service. These skills were not considered necessary for women, who were barred from learning them. Classical art indicates that girls and boys played with toys such as spinning tops, hoops, and seesaws, and played games such as piggyback. The gravestone of Plangon, an Athenian girl aged about five {{which is in the}} Glyptothek museum in Munich, shows her holding a doll; a set of knucklebones hangs on a wall in the background.|$|E
5|$|Ewes {{generally}} reach {{sexual maturity}} at {{six to eight}} months of age, and rams generally at four to six (ram lambs have occasionally been known to impregnate <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> at two months). Ewes enter into oestrus cycles about every 17 days, which last for approximately 30 hours. In addition to emitting a scent, they indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. The phenomenon of the freemartin, a female bovine that is behaviorally masculine and lacks functioning ovaries, is commonly associated with cattle, but does occur to some extent in sheep. The instance of freemartins in sheep may be increasing {{in concert with the}} rise in twinning (freemartins are the result of male-female twin combinations).|$|E

5|$|Fortuny also {{states that}} dress codes {{are a sign}} of a patriarchal {{organization}} because men are only forbidden from growing their hair long or wearing shorts in public. Women, at times, can be more autonomous than those in the general population in Mexico. Fortuny says that the growing trend of educated women having husbands in supporting roles is also seen within the Church both in the Guadalajara (Mexico), and Houston (Texas) congregations. Many young female members said they want to undergo post-secondary education, and some told Fortuny they were degree students. Both young men and women are equally encouraged to enter post-compulsory education. Fathers who are members of La Luz del Mundo are more likely than <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> to direct their daughters towards attending university.|$|E
5|$|Gestation lasts {{approximately}} 340days, with {{an average}} range 320–370 days, and usually results in one foal; twins are rare. Horses are a precocial species, and foals are capable of standing and running {{within a short time}} following birth. Foals are usually born in the spring. The estrous cycle of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. Most mares enter an anestrus period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period. Foals are generally weaned from <b>their</b> <b>mothers</b> between four and six months of age.|$|E
