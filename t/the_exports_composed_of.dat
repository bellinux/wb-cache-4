The extreme N-terminal region of FliI is involved {{not only in}} its interaction with FliH but also in its oligomerization, but the regulatory mechanism of oligomerization remains unclear. Using in-frame 10 -residue deletions within the 100 residues of the N-terminal domain, we demonstrate that the first 20 residues are required for FliH binding and that the conformation of the N-terminal domain is sensitive to <b>the</b> <b>export</b> function, even though the oligomerization and FliH-binding ability are retained and the ATPase activity is maintained {{in most of the}} deletion variants...|$|R
40|$|The Czech Republic and Sweden have {{historically}} been prominent producers and exporters of arms. The end of the Cold War has, however, changed the global patterns of arms trade. The aim of this thesis is to compare the trends in arms <b>exports</b> of <b>the</b> two countries in the years 1993 - 2012. The method involves {{a combination of a}} quantitative analysis aimed at examining how arms exports correlate to national product and military expenditure, and a qualitative analysis for an in-depth examination of the different sectors that <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> were <b>composed</b> <b>of.</b> <b>The</b> results show weak or non-existent correlations between <b>the</b> arms <b>exports</b> and <b>the</b> mentioned macroeconomic variables, with a general upward-pointing trend for Sweden and a general downward-pointing trend for the Czech Republic. Analysis by sector suggests that the Czech defense industry suffered greatly from the turbulent period that followed the end of the Cold War, thus also negatively affecting <b>the</b> country’s <b>exports.</b> <b>The</b> Swedish defense industry has not been affected to the same extent and <b>the</b> <b>exports</b> seem actually to have benefitted from reductions {{in the size of the}} armed forces.

The empirical analysis {{is based on}} the application of product space methodology (based on network theory) developed by Hidalgo et al. (2007) with data from UN comtrade database. Moreover, the paper analyzes the performance of metal industry and its productivity as one of <b>the</b> biggest <b>exporting</b> sector and investigates its capacity for further product diversification. The estimated results indicate that Macedonian export basket is highly concentrated (the top ten products have nearly half of <b>the</b> total country’s <b>export</b> and more than 70 percent of <b>the</b> <b>export</b> goes to several countries) and more importantly <b>the</b> <b>export</b> structure is <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> products with low complexity level.

So, the suggestion to policymakers in Macedonia is to be created an active industrial policy that will stimulate the structural transformation of metal industry towards products with higher value added...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterial}} type III export apparatus {{is found}} in the flagellum and in the needle complex of some pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. In the needle complex its function is to secrete effector proteins for infection into Eukaryotic cells. In the bacterial flagellum it exports specific proteins for the building of the flagellum during its assembly. <b>The</b> <b>export</b> apparatus is <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> about five membrane proteins and three soluble proteins. The mechanism of <b>the</b> <b>export</b> apparatus is not fully understood. The five membrane proteins are well conserved and essential. Here a cross-complementation assay was performed: substituting in the flagellar system of Salmonella one of these membrane proteins, FlhB, by the FlhB ortholog from Aquifex aeolicus (an evolutionary distant hyperthermophilic bacteria) or a chimeric protein (AquSalFlhB) made by the combination of the trans-membrane domain of A. aeolicus FlhB with the cytoplasmic domain of Salmonella FlhB dramatically reduced numbers of flagella and motility. From cells expressing the chimeric AquSalFlhB protein, suppressor mutants with enhanced motility were isolated and the mutations were identified using whole genome sequencing. Gain-of-function mutations were found in the gene encoding FlhA, another membrane protein of <b>the</b> type III <b>export</b> apparatus. Also, mutations were identified in genes encoding 4 -hydroxybenzoate octaprenyltransferase, ubiquinone/menaquinone biosynthesis methyltransferase, and 4 -hydroxy- 3 -methylbut- 2 -en- 1 -yl diphosphate synthase, which are required for ubiquinone biosynthesis. The mutations were shown by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography to reduce the quinone pool of the cytoplasmic membrane. Ubiquinone biosynthesis could be restored for the strain bearing a mutated gene for 4 -hydroxybenzoate octaprenyltransferase by the addition of excess exogenous 4 -hydroxybenzoate. Restoring the level of ubiquinone reduced flagella biogenesis with the AquSalFlhB chimera demonstrating that the respiratory chain quinone pool is responsible for this phenomenon...|$|R

Although POC fluxes remained < 15 mg m− 2 d− 1, variations in the magnitude and composition of <b>the</b> <b>exported</b> POC were observed during deployment. A first period of elevated POC export associated {{with an increase in}} diatom fluxes and low zooplankton fecal pellet fluxes was recorded at the beginning of May, suggesting a mismatch between phytoplankton production and zooplankton grazing. A second period <b>of</b> elevated POC <b>export</b> <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> coccolithophores, diatom resting spores and empty diatom frustules was observed in June.

The main contributors to the zooplankton fecal pellet flux also varied according to the prevailing water mass, with copepod fecal pellets dominating throughout the deployment, except at the beginning of June, when the fecal pellet flux in Atlantic Water was dominated by appendicularian fecal pellets.

40|$|For nuclear <b>export</b> of proteins, <b>the</b> {{formation}} of a ternary <b>export</b> complex <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>export</b> substrate, a cellular export factor and Ran-GTP is crucial. CRM 1 is a cellular export factor for proteins containing leucine-rich nuclear export signals (NESs).

Using our recently established systems for the generation of influenza virus or virus-like particles from cloned cDNAs, we found that NS 2 is essential for nuclear export of influenza virus ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, and that alteration of the NS 2 -NES abrogated this event and influenza virus generation.

Due to water quality and climate change issues, the catchment was heavily monitored as early as 2000. The data-driven analyses presented hereafter consider {{for the first time}} the whole 12 -year long dataset. Such outstanding time-series enabled to address the following questions: which hydrological processes are controlling solutes <b>exports</b> in <b>the</b> catchment? How does the wetness state dynamic influences these dominant processes? Four original methods are used covering the range of temporal variability from flood event to seasonality and its inter-annual variations. A solute <b>export</b> conceptual model, <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> four hydrological compartments was proposed to explain <b>the</b> diversity of <b>export</b> dynamics for <b>the</b> catchment.

Lastly, downslope advection and dispersion as well as riparian production, retention or mixing are also no negligible processes taking place in the catchment. Water quality signal is well structured in time and its structure is now further understood. The signal, strongly impacted by the agricultural use for given solutes, is dominated by seasonality but varies according to yearly hydrometeorological conditions.

40|$|PHAX (phosphorylated adaptor for RNA <b>export)</b> is <b>the</b> key {{regulator}} of U snRNA nuclear export in metazoa. Our {{previous work}} revealed that PHAX is phosphorylated in the nucleus and is exported {{as a component}} of <b>the</b> U snRNA <b>export</b> complex to <b>the</b> cytoplasm, where it is dephosphorylated (M. Ohno, A. Segref, A. Bachi, M. Wilm, and I. W. Mattaj, Cell 101 : 187 - 198, 2000). PHAX phosphorylation is essential for export complex assembly, whereas its dephosphorylation causes export complex disassembly. Thus, PHAX is subject to a compartmentalized phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle that contributes to transport directionality. However, neither essential PHAX phosphorylation sites nor the modifying enzymes that contribute to the compartmentalized system have been identified. Here, we identify PHAX phosphorylation sites that are necessary and sufficient for U snRNA <b>export.</b> Mutation of <b>the</b> phosphorylation sites inhibited U snRNA export in a dominant-negative way. We also show, by both biochemical and RNA interference knockdown experiments, that the nuclear kinase and the cytoplasmic phosphatase for PHAX are CK 2 kinase and protein phosphatase 2 A, respectively. Our results reveal the composition of the compartmentalized phosphorylation/dephosphorylation system that regulates U snRNA export. This finding was surprising in that such a specific system for U snRNA <b>export</b> regulation is <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> two such universal regulators, suggesting that this compartmentalized system is used more broadly for gene expression regulation...|$|R

Brazil seems to have a sufficient, but not saturated, technical staff working in enzyme-correlated areas, while the trade balance is deteriorating over the years.

These conclusions are corroborated by the number of scientific publications and patent documents related to the industrial use of lipases, one of the most important enzyme group: while Brazil has an important contribution in publishing scientific documents regarding the industrial use of lipases, its contribution in filing patent applications is only marginal.|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{involved in}} {{activation of the}} transcription factor NF-κB by genotoxic agents are not well understood. Previously, we provided evidence that a regulatory subunit of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) /IKKγ, is a component of a nuclear signal that is generated after DNA damage to mediate NF-κB activation. Here, we found that etoposide (VP 16) and camptothecin induced increases in intracellular free calcium levels at 60 min after stimulation of CEM T leukemic cells. Inhibition of calcium increases by calcium chelators, BAPTA-AM and EGTA-AM, abrogated NF-κB activation by these agents in several cell types examined. Conversely, thapsigargin and ionomycin attenuated the BAPTA-AM effects and promoted NF-κB activation by the genotoxic stimuli. Analyses of nuclear NEMO levels in VP 16 -treated cells suggested that calcium was required for nuclear export of NEMO. Inhibition of the nuclear exporter CRM 1 by leptomycin B did not interfere with NEMO nuclear export. Similarly, deficiency of a plausible calcium-dependent nuclear export receptor, calreticulin, failed to prevent NF-κB activation by VP 16. However, temperature inactivation of the Ran guanine nucleotide exchange factor RCC 1 in the tsBN 2 cell line harboring a temperature-sensitive mutant of RCC 1 blocked NF-κB activation induced by genotoxic stimuli. Overexpression of Ran in this cell model showed that DNA damage stimuli induced formation of a complex between Ran and NEMO, suggesting that RCC 1 regulated NF-κB activation through the modulation of RanGTP. Indeed, evidence for VP 16 -inducible interaction between Ran-GTP and NEMO could be obtained by means of glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays using GST fused to the Ran binding domain of RanBP 2, which specifically interacts with the GTP-bound form of Ran. BAPTA-AM did not alter these interactions, suggesting that calcium is a necessary step beyond {{the formation of a}} Ran-GTP-NEMO complex in the nucleus. These results suggest that calcium has a unique role in genotoxic stress-induced NF-κB signaling by regulating nuclear export of NEMO subsequent to the formation of a nuclear <b>export</b> complex <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> Ran-GTP, NEMO, and presumably, an undefined nuclear export receptor...|$|R

Here we find that peptide conjugates <b>composed</b> <b>of</b> the NES of either protein kinase A inhibitor protein (PKI) or the HIV- 1 Rev protein, when coupled to human serum albumin, are potent inhibitors of mRNA and small nuclear RNA export. These results provide direct evidence that mRNA export in vertebrates depends on interactions between an NES and its cognate NES receptors.
