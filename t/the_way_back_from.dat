The Gascon campaign cost more than £200,000 and used up all the money intended for Henry's crusade, leaving him heavily in debt and reliant on loans from his brother Richard and the Lusignans.|$|E
5|$|His {{tactic of}} diving into {{opposing}} formations often found him {{under fire from}} all directions, resulting in his aircraft being damaged beyond repair; consequently, Eduard Neumann was losing his patience. Marseille persisted, and created a unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not just in outstanding situational awareness, marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a high angle deflection shooting attack and shooting at the target's front from the side, instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft and shooting at it directly from behind. Marseille often practiced these tactics on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> missions with his comrades. Marseille became known as a master of deflection shooting.|$|E

At a brief trial, Gaveston was declared guilty of being a traitor under the terms of the Ordinances; he was executed on Blacklow Hill the following day, under the authority of the Earl of Lancaster. Gaveston's body was not buried until 1315, when his funeral was held in King's Langley Priory.|$|E
5|$|Including {{the victory}} over Leeds in 1975, Bayern Munich {{had won the}} European Cup on three {{occasions}} going into the 1999 final. With three victories in a row from 1974 to 1976, they became only the third team to achieve such a feat after Real Madrid (1956 to 1960) and Ajax (1971 to 1973). They had also finished as runners-up twice: in 1982 against Aston Villa and 1987 against Porto. Although Bayern had been waiting 23 years for a European Cup title, Manchester United had had to wait even longer, their only victory having come in 1968. Their manager then was Matt Busby, who had been seriously injured in the Munich air disaster, which killed eight of his players on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> a European Cup tie in Belgrade 10 years earlier, before rebuilding the team to become European Cup winners. Busby died in 1994; {{the day of the}} 1999 Champions League final would have been his 90th birthday.|$|E

5|$|The Congress soon {{joined the}} new Indian ministry. The League was slower to do so, not {{entering}} until October 1946. In agreeing {{to have the}} League join the government, Jinnah abandoned his demands for parity with the Congress and a veto on matters concerning Muslims. The new ministry met amid a backdrop of rioting, especially in Calcutta. The Congress wanted the Viceroy to immediately summon the constituent assembly and begin the work of writing a constitution and felt that the League ministers should either join in the request or resign from the government. Wavell attempted to save the situation by flying leaders such as Jinnah, Liaquat, and Jawaharlal Nehru to London in December 1946. At {{the end of the}} talks, participants issued a statement that the constitution would not be forced on any unwilling parts of India. On <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> London, Jinnah and Liaquat stopped in Cairo for several days of pan-Islamic meetings.|$|E

25|$|With {{increases}} in fuel capacity as the type was refined, {{the range of}} escort missions over Europe steadily increased until the P-47 was able to accompany bombers in raids {{all the way into}} Germany. On <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the raids, pilots shot up ground targets of opportunity, and also used belly shackles to carry bombs on short-range missions, which led to the realization that the P-47 could perform a dual-function on escort missions as a fighter-bomber. Even with its complicated turbosupercharger system, its sturdy airframe and tough radial engine could absorb a lot of damage and still return home.|$|E
25|$|After {{overcoming}} Shamrock Rovers and Dukla Prague in {{the preliminary}} and first round respectively, United were drawn with Red Star Belgrade of Yugoslavia for the quarter-finals.

On <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Prague in the previous round, fog over England prevented the team from flying back to Manchester, so they flew to Amsterdam before taking the ferry from the Hook of Holland to Harwich and then the train to Manchester.

25|$|Philipson was a noted gardener. A {{visit to}} Japan on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the Test series in Australia in 1895 {{inspired}} him to apply knowledge that he acquired there to estate of Stobo Castle, near Peebles, in the Scottish Borders. Stobo had originally been in the family of Philipson's wife, the Honourable Nina Murray, until their exile following the Jacobite rising of 1745. The Japanese-style water garden that Philipson created at Stobo between 1909–13 has been maintained, despite a succession of owners after the estate was sold shortly after his death. Stobo was acquired in 1971 by Leo Seymour, whose family still own it, and is occasionally open to the public.|$|E

25|$|On <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Chersonesos, {{the navy}} {{was hit by}} a horrible storm which claimed {{thousands}} of victims, but Mauros survived. Not long after the first expedition, he had to return to Chersonesos because sedition in the city had begun anew, and the newly installed Elias had joined the insurgents. Prior to Mauros' arrival, a naval expedition had failed to crush the uprising and its leaders had been murdered. Assessing the size of the rebellion, Justinian dispatched Mauros in charge of a large force complete with siege engines. Mauros had some success with the siege of the city early on, but the arrival of Khazar support for the insurgents caused Mauros to abandon Justinian and he too joined the ranks of his opponents, led by Philippikos Bardanes.|$|E

5000|$|This {{is a loss}} {{in sound}} level which happens while the sound pulse travels from {{projector}} to target and from target to receiver. There are 3 different mechanisms causing transmission Loss: spherical (or cylindrical in shallow water) spreading, absorbing and scattering by ocean media inhomogeneities. Transmission loss (TL) is proportional to range, (the longer the sound travels the more the loss), and to sound frequency. In monostatic sonar the sound first travels from projector to target, then <b>the</b> same <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> target to receiver, so two-way loss is just 2TL, where TL is one-way loss.In bistatic sonar the total loss (in decibels) is a sum of TLpt [...] (from projector to target) and TLtr [...] (from target to receiver).|$|R
25|$|The sorceress Circe is {{a figure}} from Greek mythology {{whose father was}} the sun (Helios) and whose mother was an ocean nymph. She appears in three {{separate}} stories.

He forces her to return them to human shape, lives with her {{for a year and}} has a child called Telegonus by her. Her ability to change others into animals is further highlighted by the story of Picus, an Italian king whom she turns into a woodpecker for resisting her advances. Another story makes her {{fall in love with the}} sea-god Glaucus, who prefers the nymph Scylla to her. In revenge, Circe poisoned the water where her rival bathed and turned her into a monster.|$|E
25|$|Broadcast 23 December 1993, {{the final}} {{instalment}} discusses human exploration of Antarctica, {{in particular the}} mission led by Captain Robert Falcon Scott, whose team died on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> the South Pole. Attenborough visits the hut at Cape Evans where Scott and his team spent the winter of 1911. It shows their well-equipped laboratory and the darkroom where the group's photographer, Herbert Ponting, developed his films. Attenborough contrasts the transportation used by Scott (initially motor sledge, ponies and dogs before ending up on foot) with today's helicopters. The episode also details the scientific work in the modern human bases in Antarctica, especially Mawson Base and its observation of Adelie penguins (partially through tracking devices). The film concludes that although working in Antarctica is now much easier than during {{the early days of}} exploration, human footsteps on the continent are still exceedingly rare — in part because of international treaties prohibiting industrial exploitation.|$|E
25|$|On July 10, 1943, {{the airport}} gained {{domestic}} status. This made Koltsovo the first {{airport in the}} USSR to have civil and military status at once. Flights from Yekaterinburg to Moscow were conducted on a daily basis. In December 1943, on <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>from</b> Tehran, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt stayed overnight at the Koltsovo airport. During World War II the airport acted as a joint in the classified route between Fairbanks, Alaska and Moscow, Russia, in which C-47 aircraft were imported into the USSR. By January 1944 Koltsovo owned 4 aircraft, granted by the USSR Ministry of Civil Aviation {{for the purpose of}} domestic flights: two LI-2 and two Junkers. After the surrender of Nazi Germany, Koltsovo was used as joint for the relocation of military aircraft to the Pacific Front for the combating of the Japanese Empire. Between 1943-1945, despite the extremely high traffic rates for an airport of such size, no airplane crashes were recorded.|$|E
