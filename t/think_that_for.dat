500|$|Story editor Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode, [...] "I love 'Paper Clip'. I {{was thrilled}} with the plot. I know it moved very fast for some people, but I {{actually}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> some of these shows you don't need to understand everything. I think it is more exciting to go at rocket speed. Everybody was on the mark in that one; David and Gillian's performances, Rob Bowman's direction, Chris Carter's writing—everything was just terrific in that show". Bowman said [...] "When I finished 'Paper Clip', I thought, 'I don't know what else I {{am going to do}} this year to top this'" [...] In 1996 Mitch Pileggi called the episode one of the show's finest, particularly enjoying the line where he tells The Smoking Man to [...] "pucker up and kiss my ass". Pileggi claims that is one of his favorite lines. The scene was used frequently to introduce him at X-Files conventions.|$|E
500|$|Speaking to {{entertainment}} news website Digital Spy about Sarah and Zoe's relationship, Lister explained: [...] "I don't {{think they do}} have feelings for each other in that way. Last year happened and Zoe put it down to history and experience — {{one of those things}} that teenagers get up to occasionally and she was quite happy to leave it there. They've got through a lot and their relationship is really quite special. There's a lot of love there but Zoe's not got anything sexual for Sarah — it's purely a deep friendship." [...] Meanwhile, Batley said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> Sarah, Zoe's the best friend she's ever had — a lot of people in her life have let her down but Zoe's her rock. Even though they've had their fall-outs, she's always been there for her and she loves her as a friend. I think Zoe feels the same. But for Sarah it's something more — she completely relies on her and that turns into love for her as well." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Teeth" [...] {{was written}} by Lady Gaga, Taja Riley, Pete Wyoming Bender, and Teddy Riley, and was {{produced}} by Gaga and Teddy Riley. It {{has been described as}} a [...] "perverse march" [...] and a [...] "gospel ode" [...] to sadomasochism. Bradley Stern of MuuMuse said the song is [...] "part musical, part country, and a little bit tribal in spots". Popjustice described [...] "Teeth" [...] as a [...] "wobbly, stompy, bouncy marching song" [...] that opens with the lyric [...] "don't want no money, just want your sex" [...] and later chants, [...] "show me your teeth!" [...] Lyrically, Gaga asks her lover to display his teeth for her. According to MusicOMH, [...] "In the background another voice intones strange messages, which may or may not revolve around dentistry". Music Times said the [...] "skank-y" [...] horns in the track exhibit Riley's work. In an interview with MTV, Gaga explained the meaning behind the song and its lyrics: [...] "It is meant to mean two things, the first one kind of juvenile sexual provocative connotation is about oral sex, but also the monster in the song is fear of the truth. 'Show me your teeth' means 'tell me the truth' and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a long time in my life that I replaced sex with the truth." ...|$|E

"Béla's {{conduct in}} this matter {{is not to be}} commended, my good Irma," [...] said the {{neighbour}} sententiously; [...] "everyone <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> a tokened man it is a scandal to be always hanging round that pert Jewess.

500|$|Much of {{the focus}} was spent on {{updating}} Modern Warfares visuals {{in order to bring}} them up to modern standards. Enhancements of the environments and vistas were achieved using a procedure called [...] "Paint-over", with a larger amount of onscreen objects and effects being integrated into them. Raven also wanted to give the environments a sense of place and history to avoid feeling generic. The vast majority of objects were remodeled, with the game using improved texture depth, physically-based rendering, and light-reflection; and additional features such as realistic physics and joints employed for movable objects like character models. Raven paid close attention to improving all guns in the game because, as a developer explained, [...] "We needed to take the weapons up to the same level of personality as the characters"; each received better dynamics, alterations made to their firing mechanisms, and a new feature in the series that allowed each type to eject shell casings unique to that weapon. However, issues arose during the remastering of the game's graphics as the remaster used a heavily upgraded version of the series' engine. As a result, this meant that several of the original's visual assets were not compatible with the new technology, so the developers were necessitated to remake them. Most of the existing motion capture animation was redone for the same reason, as well as to provide further story exposition. The campaign saw a number of new first-person animations added for further immersion and emotional responses from players, and to improve how the camera made use of the player character's body, enhancing the [...] "body sense". Pellas said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> [...] campaign, we were definitely more liberal with our animations and additions, as long as they enhanced the true intent of the moment." [...] The artificial intelligence of non-player characters was also improved to respond more realistically with the environment, and vice versa, such as long grass reacting to the player character's presence.|$|E
2500|$|Academic Brij Lal, one of {{the authors}} of the Constitution, {{described}} the Charter as [...] "too prescriptive", commenting that it appeared to aim at creating an unfeasible utopia. He added: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> the charter and some of the recommendations to have credibility, they have to be endorsed through parliament." ...|$|E
2500|$|Epicurus {{was first}} to assert human freedom as coming from a {{fundamental}} indeterminism in the motion of atoms. This has led some philosophers to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> Epicurus free will was caused directly by chance. In his On the Nature of Things (De rerum natura), Lucretius appears to suggest this in the best-known passage on Epicurus' position. But in his Letter to Menoeceus, Epicurus follows Aristotle and clearly identifies three possible causes [...] - [...] "some things happen of necessity, others by chance, others through our own agency." [...] Aristotle said some things [...] "depend on us" [...] (eph'hemin). Epicurus agreed, and said it is to these last things that praise and blame naturally attach. For Epicurus, the [...] "swerve" [...] (or clinamen) of the atoms simply defeated determinism to leave room for autonomous agency.|$|E

2500|$|O'Connor {{also said}} Letitia Dean was [...] "absolutely thrilled, because she [...] and Jenna {{were in the}} same year at drama school {{together}} as children. So we're articulating a 30 year old relationship between these two women, and that's something that they already have." [...] and [...] "there's a genuine affectionate recognition in that from Adam [...] for Jenna, because they've known each other for such a long time. Again, it shows - I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> Jenna, being part of EastEnders has been the destiny of her career." [...] Tully [...] "gave the idea" [...] of recasting Michelle [...] "her blessing, and it was really delightful when she did." [...] Tully was also involved in telling O'Connor, Russell and the writing team about Smith and Holland's original ideas for Michelle.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2007, Thomas told an {{audience}} at Hillsdale College: [...] "My colleagues should shut up!" [...] He later explained, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> judging, {{and for what}} we are doing, all those questions are necessary." [...] According to Amber Porter of ABC News, {{one of the most}} notable examples of a rare instance in which Thomas asked a question was in 2002 during oral arguments for Virginia v. Black, when he expressed concern to Michael Dreeben, who had been speaking on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice, that he was [...] "actually understating the symbolism... and the effect of... the burning cross" [...] and its use {{as a symbol of the}} [...] "reign of terror" [...] of [...] "100 years of lynching and activity in the South by the Knights of Camellia... and the Ku Klux Klan".|$|E
2500|$|The first Northern {{reaction}} among antislavery advocates to Brown's Raid {{was one of}} baffled reproach. William Lloyd Garrison {{called the}} raid [...] "misguided, wild, and apparently insane." [...] But through the trial and his execution, Brown {{was transformed into a}} martyr. Henry David Thoreau, in A Plea for Captain John Brown, said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>for</b> once the Sharp's rifles and the revolvers were employed in a righteous cause. The tools were in the hands of one who could use them," [...] and said of Brown, [...] "He has a spark of divinity in him." [...] Though [...] "Harper's Ferry was insane," [...] wrote the religious weekly the Independent, [...] "the controlling motive of his demonstration was sublime." [...] To the South, Brown was a murderer who wanted to deprive them of their property. The North [...] "has sanctioned and applauded theft, murder, and treason," [...] said De Bow's Review.|$|E

On June 19, 2008, he opted out of public campaign financing and declared, [...] "I support a robust system of public financing of elections (...) but the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken."
