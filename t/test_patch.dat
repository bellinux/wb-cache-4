40|$|The yeast Malassezia furfur {{belongs to}} the normal {{cutaneous}} flora, but is also a triggering allergen that can contribute to atopic dermatitis. To illuminate the effect of circulating allergen-specific T cells in atopic dermatitis, the peripheral mononuclear cell response was correlated with the in vivo skin prick <b>test</b> and atopy <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> reactivity to M. furfur. None of 16 healthy controls showed any positive in vivo reaction. The 40 atopic dermatitis patients, of whom 18 had serum IgE reactivity to M. furfur, were subdivided according to their in vivo reaction to M. furfur extract into three groups: skin prick <b>test</b> positive/atopy <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> positive (n[*]=[*] 12), skin prick <b>test</b> positive/atopy <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> negative (n[*]=[*] 12), and skin prick <b>test</b> negative/atopy <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> negative (n[*]=[*] 16). The skin prick <b>test</b> positive/atopy <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> positive and the skin prick <b>test</b> positive/atopy <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> negative groups had a significantly higher peripheral mononuclear cell stimulation index than the healthy controls.

In 1886, concrete pioneer George Bartholomew moved to Logan County, where he found high-quality raw materials used for concrete production. By 1891, he had hopes of using concrete for street pavement, so he gained the Bellefontaine city council's permission to pave a few square feet of the nearby Main Street as a <b>test</b> <b>patch.</b> Although some feared that concrete pavement would quickly be damaged or destroyed, the pavement endured, and in 1893, the council permitted the pavement of all the streets surrounding the courthouse, including Court Avenue. While Bartholomew provided the materials, the actual process of laying the concrete was led by James Wonders, the county engineer. The council was not initially enthusiastic about the proposal, nevertheless; having found no previous examples of such paving methods, it required Bartholomew to donate the cement and to pay a $5,000 bond {{to ensure that the}} pavement would last for five years. These fears also led authorities to have the concrete covered in sawdust in cold weather.|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{explore the}} color perception {{of objects in}} complex scenes. The first experiment examines the color perception of objects across variation in surface gloss. Observers adjusted the color appearance of a matte sphere to match that of a test sphere. Across conditions we varied the body color and glossiness of the test sphere. The data indicate that observers do not simply match the average light reflected from the test. Indeed, the visual system compensates for the physical effect of varying the gloss, so that appearance is stabilized relative to what is predicted by the spatial average. The second experiment examines how people perceive color across locations on an object. We replaced the test sphere with a soccer ball that had one of its hexagonal faces colored.

40|$|AbstractProlonged {{viewing of}} a {{flickering}} region reduces sensitivity to a subsequently flickered <b>test</b> <b>patch</b> of identical extent, but the spatial properties of this adaptation are unknown. What {{happens to the}} sensitivity to a smaller flickered <b>test</b> <b>patch</b> completely contained in, but inset from, the adapted region? We show that sensitivity to the inset <b>test</b> <b>patch</b> is only slightly affected by adaptation of the larger region. This suggests that neurons that respond {{to the edges of}} the smaller <b>test</b> <b>patch</b> are not adapted by the larger flickering region. We then show that an annulus adapter designed specifically to adapt only those edges only slightly reduces sensitivity, demonstrating that neurons that do not adapt to the flickered edges are also involved in detecting flicker. This gives further evidence that flicker detection depends on at least two mechanisms – one sensitive to flickering edges and one sensitive to local flicker, and shows that these mechanisms can operate in isolation...|$|E

Epidermal cells, isolated from suction blisters, were double labeled for CD 1 /HLA-DR, CD 3 /HLA-DR, or CD 36 /HLA-DR cell surface markers and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the percentage of various cell populations. A mean increase of 0. 91 ± 0. 3 {{in the percentage of}} DR+CD 1 + Langerhans cells over the vehicle control <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> site was detected in allergen-positive <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> sites in allergic individuals, whereas a decrease of 0. 19 ± 0. 2 in the percentage of DR+CD 1 + Langerhans cells from the vehicle control <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> site was detected in irritant-treated <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> sites.

40|$|Traditional {{trichromatic}} {{theories of}} color vision conclude that color perception {{is not possible}} under scotopic illumination in which only one type of photoreceptor, rods, is active. The current study demonstrates the existence of scotopic color perception and indicates that perceived hue is influenced by spatial context and top-down processes of color perception. Experiment 1 required observers to report the perceived hue in various natural scene images under purely rod-mediated vision. The results showed that when the <b>test</b> <b>patch</b> had low variation in the luminance distribution and was a decrement in luminance compared to the surrounding area, reddish or orangish percepts {{were more likely to}} be reported compared to all other percepts. In contrast, when the <b>test</b> <b>patch</b> had a high variation and was an increment in luminance, the probability of perceiving blue, green, or yellow hues increased. In addition, when observers had a strong, but singular, daylight hue association for the <b>test</b> <b>patch,</b> color percepts were reported more often and hues appeared more saturated compared to patches with no daylight hue association. This suggests that experience in daylight conditions modulates the bottom-up processing for rod-mediated color perception. In Experiment 2, observers reported changes in hue percepts for a test ring surrounded by inducing rings that varied in spatial context. In sum, the results challenge the classic view that rod vision is achromatic and suggest that scotopic hue perception is mediated by cortical mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn an inhomogeneous {{checkerboard}} surround, {{the lighter}} check darkens an incremental <b>test</b> <b>patch</b> {{more than the}} darker check lightens it. However, decremental test patches are influenced equally [Schirillo & Shevell, 1996. Vision Research, 36, 1783 – 1796]. In the current study, we manipulate the spatial arrangement of a checkerboard surround to produce T-junctions that perceptually group the checks with the <b>test</b> <b>patch.</b> These stimuli alter the inducing effects of the checks. For one modified surround, increments appeared ∼ 8 % darker and decrements appeared ∼ 10 % lighter over the original checkerboard surround prior to modification. In a second modified surround, that resembled White's illusion [White, 1979. Perception, 8, 413 – 416], increments again appeared ∼ 8 % darker, while decrements appeared a dramatic ∼ 23 % lighter over the original checkerboard surround prior to modification. These enhanced induction effects are postulated to result from the addition of specific T-junctions. However, these grouping effects remain subservient to the asymmetrical induction effects found by Schirillo and Shevell (1996) ...|$|E

Methods We analysed retrospectively the <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> records of 400 sequential PPD-positive patients for the strength of <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> reaction (+, ++, +++) and different clinical features. Data were analysed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel χ 2 tests. Results: There was a strong linear relationship between the strength of <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> reaction and continuation with hair dyeing. Patients {{were more likely to report}} a history of hair dye reaction with increasing strength of <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> reaction. There was no difference in strength of <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> reaction in relation to age, site of rash, occupation (hairdressing) or history of atopic eczema. Overall concomitant reactivity with related aromatic amine allergens (benzocaine, N-isopropyl-N-phenyl-para-phenylenediamine, para-aminobenzoic acid) was infrequent. Conclusions: Patients with stronger <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> reactions (++, +++) are more likely to have a clear history of reacting to hair dye and are less likely to still be dyeing their hair. © 2005 British Association of Dermatologists. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundIn {{the present}} study, we {{measured}} specific IgE radioallergosorbent test (RAST) levels for house dust, mites, Japanese cedar, kamogaya (Dactylis glomerata) and ragweed antigens {{in a group}} of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients and healthy volunteer subjects in our outpatient clinic. We also performed closed <b>patch</b> <b>testing</b> with <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> reagents using the aforementioned antigens prepared from commercially available skin reaction antigens. MethodsThe dermatologic symptom severity index, duration of disease, total serum IgE, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and eosinophil counts were assessed. The relationship between each of these parameters and the intensity of the response to the <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> was then evaluated. ResultsThe <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> positivity rate increased in proportion with the duration of antigen application, with a maximum of 15. 6 % for mite antigen and a minimum of 4. 7 % for cedar antigen by 72 h. There were no antigens showing negative results in any patients. The positivity rate was lower for <b>patch</b> <b>tests</b> applied on highly keratinized areas of skin. The 72 h positive <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> responses were significantly correlated with total serum IgE, LDH, symptom severity index and specific IgE RAST levels. Most positive <b>patch</b> <b>test</b> responses were considered to be possible late phase reactions of the type I allergic response. However, a small number of patients had IgE RAST negative antigens but positive <b>patch</b> <b>tests.</b> ConclusionsThese findings suggest the presence of more than one mechanism by which a positive reaction is elicited...|$|R
40|$|After {{a review}} of present {{knowledge}} on allergic reactions to kiwi (Actinidia chinensis), a case of allergic contact dermatitis of the hands and allergic oral syndrome in a 43 -year old woman is described. The patient suffered from chronic allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis caused by Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. Skin <b>tests</b> (<b>patch</b> <b>test,</b> open test, prick test, prick by prick) and oral challenge test documented immediate and delayed hypersensitivity to Actinidia chinensis. The hand dermatitis regressed avoiding the contact and ingestion of kiwi...|$|R
