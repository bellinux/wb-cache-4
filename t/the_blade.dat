5|$|Although Kratos killed Poseidon, he was {{abandoned}} by Gaia when his {{first encounter with}} Zeus went poorly. Stranded in the Underworld and now betrayed by both the Olympians and Titans, Kratos learned from the spirit of Athena, who also provided the Blades of Exile, {{that he needed to}} find the Flame of Olympus, which is the key to defeating Zeus. Kratos murdered both Titans and gods, ignoring the warnings of his victims as he sought the Flame. Realizing the key to pacifying the Flame and reaching Pandora's Box (engulfed by the Flame) is Pandora herself, Kratos came to care for Pandora, who reminded him of his lost daughter Calliope. Kratos showed humanity when he attempted to stop Pandora from sacrificing herself to quench the Flame, but reluctantly allowed the act when she said there was no other option. Finding the box empty, and driven berserk by Zeus' mockery, Kratos attacked his father. Although Gaia interrupted and tried to kill Kratos and Zeus, she was destroyed by Kratos, who then apparently defeated Zeus. Zeus returned in spirit form and attacked Kratos, who retreated into his psyche. Kratos forgave himself for his past sins with the help of Lysandra. Pandora later appeared and told Kratos that hope would save him. Kratos was revived and easily destroyed Zeus. Athena confronted Kratos and demanded that he return the power of hope; the contents of Pandora's Box. In a selfless act, Kratos refused, stated his need for vengeance was gone and impaled himself with <b>the</b> <b>Blade</b> of Olympus, which dispersed the power across the world for mankind's use. Athena, disappointed with Kratos, removed <b>the</b> <b>Blade</b> and departed as Kratos collapsed next to <b>the</b> <b>Blade</b> of Olympus. The post-credits scene showed a trail of blood leading away from <b>the</b> <b>Blade</b> with Kratos' whereabouts unknown.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the slow}} start, Shadow Dragon and <b>the</b> <b>Blade</b> of Light proved {{enough of a}} success that a new game was commissioned. This would become Fire Emblem Gaiden, which {{released}} in 1992. Shadow Dragon and <b>the</b> <b>Blade</b> of Light was partially remade {{as part of the}} 1994 release , which also continued the story of Marth. A full remake for the Nintendo DS was later developed. It would release internationally under the title , marking the first time the content of the first Fire Emblem was made available outside Japan. The setting of Archanea would later be used again in the 2012/3 entry Fire Emblem Awakening.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{increased}} hardware capabilities, the team were able to increase both the content and graphical quality. With the aim of encouraging new players to buy the game, the overall difficulty was reduced compared to previous entries. After the unconventional gameplay of Gaiden, Mystery of the Emblem returned to the traditional gameplay used for Shadow Dragon and <b>the</b> <b>Blade</b> of Light, in addition to continuing the story of Marth after focusing on different characters for Gaiden. Mystery of the Emblem was initially only going to include original story content, but after consideration, {{it was decided to}} include an upgraded version of Shadow Dragon and <b>the</b> <b>Blade</b> of Light for those who had not played the original. Another proposed plan was to split the release into two parts: a remake of Shadow Dragon and <b>the</b> <b>Blade</b> of Light and Mystery of the Emblem. Due to space limitations, some characters featured in the original version of Shadow Dragon and <b>the</b> <b>Blade</b> of Light needed to be cut. The romance between Marth and Caeda was introduced as a refined version of a similar plot featured in Gaiden. As with previous games set in Archanea, the series' titular Fire Emblem took the form of a shield inset with five magical gems. According to Kaga, Mystery of the Emblem was intended as the last major title to be set on the continent of Archanea.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Blade</b> started {{publishing}} weekly in January 1983 and coverage {{shifted to the}} AIDS crisis and news about this newly emerging disease. The ever-breaking news caused the paper to remain in a heightened state of coverage and nearly exhausted the papers resources {{with members of the}} community having to step in to support the work of <b>the</b> <b>Blade.</b> The reporting of the AIDS crisis from this timeframe allowed the newspaper to come of age to the mature and professionally driven publication seen today. In June 1988, the editors of the paper used a computer to layout the paper for the first time. The 1990s saw increases in readership and circulation of the Washington Blade. In April 1993, during the 1993 Gay March on Washington, the paper published its largest edition to date consisting of 216 pages. The paper expanded into new markets and mediums with the 1995 launch of the online version of <b>the</b> <b>Blade,</b> followed two years later with the launching of a sister publication in New York, called the New York Blade.

5|$|The dark bluish-green {{color and}} the widely spaced, deeply cut and {{indented}} pinnae differentiate A.montanum from most related species.

Wall-rue (A.ruta-muraria) has a green stipe, and its pinnae have longer stalks and are broadest near the tip. Wherry's spleenwort (A.×wherryi), a hybrid between Bradley's spleenwort and mountain spleenwort, is intermediate between its parents. When compared with mountain spleenwort, <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> of Wherry's spleenwort is lance-shaped, rather than triangular; the upper parts of <b>the</b> <b>blade</b> are not as deeply cut; and the dark color of the stipe extends {{to the beginning of}} the rachis.|$|E
5|$|According to Kaga, upon release Shadow Dragon and <b>the</b> <b>Blade</b> of Light {{received}} extensive {{criticism from}} Japanese publications, with many noting {{that it was}} difficult to understand and had fairly poor graphics, awarding it low scores. In contrast, popular opinion was more positive: in a poll taken by Family Computer Magazine, the game scored 23.48 points out of 30. Likewise, sales of the game were flat for the first two months of sales, but improved after word of mouth had spread. According to Kaga, a notable journalistic writer devoted a Famitsu column to the game, and this prompted sales to pick up around half a year after release. As of 2002, Shadow Dragon and <b>the</b> <b>Blade</b> of Light had sold 329,087 units, being the third best-selling title in the series to that date.|$|E

5|$|Kaga {{designed}} Gaiden {{to address}} issues raised with the first game, such as tedious elements of map navigation. The system of Shadow Dragon and <b>the</b> <b>Blade</b> of Light was used as base for various improvements to aspects such as enemy AI, although the gameplay adjustments ended up removing some of the strategic elements. These elements included a navigable overworld and more overt role-playing elements, along {{with the introduction of}} the class evolution system. Balancing these elements proved challenging for the team. The game made use of the new MMC4 memory chip, developed partially in response to the memory capacity problems faced during the development of the first game. For the story, Kaga wanted to deepen the relationship between the player and their units, represented through the growth of the characters through their battles. To create a stronger and broader central narrative, Kaga created the game's dual protagonists. An overt reference to Shadow Dragon and <b>the</b> <b>Blade</b> of Light was made {{in the form of a}} trio of female Pegasus Knights, who were similar to another trio from the first game yet bore different names.|$|E
