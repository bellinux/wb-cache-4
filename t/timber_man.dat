60|$|It {{was long}} after midnight when Pierre {{returned}} to the house. He had rushed forth in that complete abandonment of soul, which, in so ardent a temperament, attends the first stages of any sudden and tremendous affliction; but now he returned in pallid composure, for the calm spirit of the night, and the then risen moon, and the late revealed stars, had all at last become as a strange subduing melody to him, which, though at first trampled and scorned, yet by degrees had stolen into the windings of his heart, and so shed abroad its own quietude in him. Now, from his height of composure, he firmly gazed abroad upon the charred landscape within him; as the <b>timber</b> <b>man</b> of Canada, forced to fly from the conflagration of his forests, comes back again when the fires have waned, and unblinkingly eyes the immeasurable fields of fire-brands that here and there glow beneath the wide canopy of smoke.|$|E

At the age of eighteen he joined the St. Just and District Operatic Society and, {{in addition to his}} bass voice, locals found he had a talent for making an audience laugh.

5000|$|The feud arose out of {{personal}} grievances between Paris Brumfield (c.1837-1891), a distiller, storekeeper, and <b>timber</b> <b>man,</b> and Canaan [...] "Cain" [...] Adkins (1833-1896), a United Baptist preacher, country physician, schoolteacher, and {{justice of the}} peace. A {{great deal of the}} early trouble centered on ownership of a key piece of real estate at the mouth of Harts Creek. Aside from the Brumfield-Adkins quarrel, the feud included family quarrels between Henderson Dingess (1829-1902), a distiller, and his brother-in-law, Benjamin Adams (1854-1910), a timber boss, and the Halls, one of whom had married Dingess' son, Floyd.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his poem}} Over the Range, Andrew [...] "Banjo" [...] Paterson {{wrote of the}} {{obstacle}} that the Moonbi Range created for travelers to the Northern Tablelands. When Banjo Paterson was born in 1864, the Great North Road was still in poor condition making travel to the New England district for wagon teams very difficult. The mountain range was also immortalised {{in the annals of}} Australian country and western music by Buddy Williams. His song, The Mighty Moonbi Range, fitted into the truckdriving genre and included spellbinding verses such as, [...] "Big Jim was a <b>timber</b> <b>man</b> with muscles made of steel. An iron nerve to hold the curve, two big hands on the wheel. But twenty tonnes of ironbark, the devils fatal load, went crashing off the Moonbi... the end of Big Jim's road." ...|$|E
50|$|During this time, the lumbermen {{were very}} serious and {{competitive}} about the trees. Whoever got to the best trees first claimed them. Dynamite {{was used as a}} tool of sabotage to blow up some of the log booms that were strung across the river to catch the recently cut trees. It is also known that at times the <b>timber</b> <b>men</b> purposely sorted their logs incorrectly to attempt to confuse local officials charged with regulating timber trade and transportation.|$|R

50|$|Simcoe {{realized}} that Newark made an unsuitable capital {{because it was}} on the Canada-US border and subject to attack. He proposed moving the capital to a more defensible position, in the middle of Upper Canada's southwestern peninsula between Lake Erie and Lake Huron. He named the new location London, and renamed the river there the Thames in anticipation of the change. Dorchester rejected this proposal, but accepted Simcoe's second choice, the present site of Toronto. Simcoe moved the capital there in 1793, and renamed the settlement York after Frederick, Duke of York, King George III's second son. The town was severely underdeveloped {{at the time of its}} founding so he brought with him politicians, builders, Nova Scotia <b>timber</b> <b>men,</b> and Englishmen skilled in whipsawing and cutting joists and rafters.|$|R

5000|$|The {{dance of}} The Tiger and the Deer {{goes back to}} 1868, when San Juan Nonualco was {{inhabited}} by natives that lived off the hunting of deer that were plentiful in the area. However, there was a tiger that devoured the animals. The dance presents {{the story of a}} married couple that left to hunt the tiger; however, he was attacked by the animal and he had to request aid to some <b>timber</b> <b>men</b> that were close and to beg to the Señor de la Caridad, protector of the municipality, to save them of the danger. The hunters killed the tiger. The dance is carried out in the party of May 2. It consists of four characters: “the old ones” that represent the couple that go with the shotgun and the bow; the tiger and the Lord of the drum that mark the steps of the dance. The spectators watch when the tiger attacks the old ones, but these behead it. The most amusing part is the “repartition” of the portions of the animal, which is called “behead the priest”, “the forehead for Vicente”, “the head for Teresa”... until all the residents are beheaded.|$|R

At times they were stopped altogether by a maze of washed-up <b>timber</b> no <b>man</b> could struggle through, and the axes were plied {{for an hour or}} more before they went on again.|$|R

A <b>man</b> against whom he had to swear the peace drank himself to death, and {{he was accused of}} causing the misfortune and when he prosecuted a man for theft he was insulted by the defendant's counsel (whom he later [...] "chastised" [...] in his Latin poetry).

60|$|Frank now {{gave the}} party {{an account of}} what he had seen, but as his {{experience}} merely corroborated that of Dick Prince and Massan, we will not trouble the reader with the details. The evidence of the various exploring parties, when summed up, was undoubtedly most satisfactory, and while it relieved the mind {{of the leaders of the}} band, it raised and cheered the spirits of the <b>men.</b> <b>Timber,</b> although not plentiful or very large, was to be had close to the spot where they proposed to erect their fort; game of all kinds swarmed in the mountains in abundance; and the lakes and rivers were well stocked with excellent fish: so that, upon the whole, they considered that they had made an auspicious commencement to their sojourn in the land of the Esquimaux.|$|R
5000|$|Carnarvon was witty, hospitable and extravagant; Samuel Pepys records his {{saying that}} God {{provides}} <b>timber</b> so that <b>men</b> may pay their debts. He rarely spoke on public affairs, but his {{intervention in the}} House of Lords debate on the impeachment of the Earl of Danby in 1678 may have been crucial. In a speech of great wit and humour he drew examples going back over a century to show that managing the impeachment of another public figure was virtually a guarantee of being impeached oneself and cheerfully urged his fellow peers to [...] "mark the man who first dares to run down Lord Danby and see what becomes of him". The Lords then voted not to commit Danby to prison until he had been heard in his own defence.|$|R
50|$|Being {{the infamous}} bandit that he was, {{there were many}} who {{attempted}} to pursue Joaquín Murieta. Captain Harry Love was an express rider and Mexican war and had a history as infamous as Joaquín. Love followed the murders and robberies of the banditti to Rancho San Luis Gonzaga and nearly locates Joaquín, who barely escapes unseen. Another man, the owner of Oris <b>Timbers</b> Rancho (a <b>man</b> they robbed twenty horses from) picks up Joaquín’s trail and follows his band to Tejon Indian territory, where he makes deal with Indian chief Sapatarra in which he promises half of the stolen horses if they are recovered by his tribe. Known {{to be a very}} cautious tribe, they capture Joaquín and men, bind them together and steal back the horses. Eventually, they are tied to a tree and left with nothing.|$|R
50|$|Spencer was in {{attendance}} as the Timbers were back at PGE Park to host NSC Minnesota Stars on August 11. A sold out crowd watched as Minnesota took an early lead, but a third league goal from Bright Dike meant {{the score was}} tied 1 - 1 at halftime. In the second half, Ryan Pore was brought down inside the penalty area by a Stars defender and the Timbers were awarded a penalty. Pore scored with the penalty kick in the 63rd minute for his league-leading twelfth goal of the season. The celebrations were short-lived as one minute later Portland captain Ian Joy received a straight red card after a tackle on Stars midfielder Geison Moura. The <b>Timbers,</b> playing a <b>man</b> down, were unable to hold off Minnesota who equalized in the 73rd minute to draw with Portland 2 - 2.|$|R
60|$|The king, having thus at last settled his quarrels and {{established}} himself {{in something like}} peace in Sicily, began to turn his attention toward the preparations for the spring. Of course, his intention was, {{as soon as the}} spring should open, to set sail with his fleet and army, and proceed toward the Holy Land. He now caused all his ships to be examined with a view to ascertain what repairs they needed. Some had been injured by the storms which they had encountered on the way from Marseilles or by accidents of the sea. Others had become worm-eaten and leaky by lying in port. Richard caused them all to be put thoroughly in repair. He also caused a number of battering engines to be constructed of <b>timber</b> which his <b>men</b> hauled from the forests around the base of Mount Ætna. These engines were for assailing the walls of the towns and fortresses in the Holy Land.|$|R
5000|$|Stevenson {{deliberately}} {{leaves the}} exact {{date of the}} novel obscure, Hawkins writing that he takes up his pen [...] "in the year of grace 17—." [...] Stevenson's map of Treasure Island includes the annotations Treasure Island 1 August 1750 J.F. and Given by above J.F. to Mr W. Bones Maste of ye Walrus Savannah this twenty July 1754 W B. The first of these two dates is likely the date at which Flint left his treasure at the island; the second, just prior to Flint's death. Flint {{is likely to have}} died less than three years before the events of the novel (the length of time that Ben Gunn was marooned), as Ben Gunn seems to be not aware of his death. Other dates mentioned include 1745, the date Dr. Livesey served as a soldier at Fontenoy and also a date appearing in Billy Bones' log. The most probable dates for the story would be late 1754 (or 1755) for the first chapters and 1755 (or 1756) for the voyage. Nevertheless, Long John Silver said in chapter XI: [...] "Old Pew, as had lost his sight, and might have thought shame, spends twelve hundred pound in a year, like a lord in Parliament. Where is he now? Well, he’s dead now and under hatches; but for two year before that, shiver my <b>timbers!</b> the <b>man</b> was starving. He begged, and he stole, and he cut throats, and starved at that, by the powers!” So if Pew got the twelve hundred pound after Flint was dead, the implication is that three years have elapsed between Flint's death and Pew's death, giving 1757 as the beginning of the story.|$|R
60|$|Two miles beyond Crater Lake lay Happy Camp--so {{named because}} here was found the {{uppermost}} {{fringe of the}} <b>timber</b> line, where <b>men</b> might warm themselves by fire again. Scarcely could it be called timber, for it was a dwarf rock-spruce that never raised its loftiest branches higher than a foot above the moss, and that twisted and grovelled like a pig-vegetable under the moss. Here, on the trail leading into Happy Camp, in the first sunshine {{of half a dozen}} days, Old Tarwater rested his pack against a huge boulder and caught his breath. Around this boulder the trail passed, laden men toiling slowly forward and men with empty pack-straps limping rapidly back for fresh loads. Twice Old Tarwater essayed to rise and go on, and each time, warned by his shakiness, sank back to recover more strength. From around the boulder he heard voices in greeting, recognized Charles Crayton's voice, and realized that at last they had met up with Young Liverpool. Quickly, Charles plunged into business, and Tarwater heard with great distinctness every word of Charles' unflattering description of him and the proposition to give him passage to Dawson.|$|R
50|$|Located on {{the eastern}} border of East Gosford is Erina Creek. Originally the creek {{provided}} access to the many ketches and steamers which came in and out on <b>timber</b> business. A <b>man</b> operating a punt carried people and their goods across Erina Creek. In 1884 the Government called tenders {{for the construction of}} an iron drawbridge with timber approaches. On 15 September, the tender of John Johnstone was accepted and work began. The bridge was completed in 1886, probably early in the year, at a cost of ₤3,695/15/-, which was considerably more than the average cost of £500 for country bridges. Part of the bridge rolled back towards the Gosford side by means of wheels guided on rails. This was achieved by men cranking the mechanism by hand. The bridge was opened seven times a day. The last of the steamers to go through was the Lone Pine in 1928. The old Punt Bridge, as it was called, was replaced by a modern bridge built by Beattie and Frost Pty Ltd of Gosford in 1962. It is still known as The Punt Bridge and forms part of the Central Coast Highway.|$|R
