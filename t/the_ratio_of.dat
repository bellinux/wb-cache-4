5|$|According to the Parliamentary paper Misc. 5 of 1966, the {{background}} of the ensign is red with <b>the</b> <b>ratio</b> <b>of</b> its width to its length being one by two.

According to a 1999 circular National Colours for Singapore Ships issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the red colour of the civil ensign is the same as that of the national flag.
