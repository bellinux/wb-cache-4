5|$|Wodehouse's {{early period}} {{as a writer}} {{came to an end}} in 1908 with the {{serialisation}} of The Lost Lambs, published the following year in book form as {{the second half of the}} novel Mike. The work begins as a conventional school story, but Wodehouse introduces a new and strikingly original character, Psmith, whose creation both Evelyn Waugh and George Orwell regarded as a watershed in Wodehouse's development. Wodehouse said that he based Psmith on the hotelier and impresario Rupert D'Oyly Carte—"the only <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> literary career which was handed to me on a silver plate with watercress around it". Wodehouse wrote in the 1970s that a cousin of his who had been at school with Carte told him of the latter's monocle, studied suavity, and stateliness of speech, all of which Wodehouse adopted for his new character. Psmith featured in three more novels: Psmith in the City (1910), a burlesque of banking; Psmith, Journalist (1915) set in New York; and Leave It to Psmith (1923), set at Blandings Castle.|$|E
500|$|Despite Pinkertons initial failure, during Weezer's hiatus {{the album}} amassed a cult following. By {{the time of}} the release of the Green Album in 2001, a wave of {{mainstream}} emo bands including Jimmy Eat World, Saves the Day, Dashboard Confessional and Motion City Soundtrack had cited it as a major influence. Cuomo was not comforted by this development, and told Rolling Stone in 2001: [...] "The most painful <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life these days is the cult around Pinkerton. It's just a sick album, sick in a diseased sort of way. It's such a source of anxiety because all the fans we have right now have stuck around because of that album. But, honestly, I never want to play those songs again; I never want to hear them again." ...|$|E

After they performed [...] "No More Cryin'" [...] there, Herndon suggested that they officially reunite as McBride & the Ride, saying [...] "This <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> gut was telling me that this was the right time for this." [...] The trio recorded demo tapes and began searching for a record deal, signing to the independent Dualtone Records in 2002. Working with pianist and record producer Matt Rollings, McBride & the Ride recorded its only album for Dualtone, titled Amarillo Sky, and released it in September of that year. Unlike previous albums, the band wrote most of the songs and played most of the instruments itself because, according to Thomas, [...] "Terry thought this would be even more of a band-like situation if we wrote together more. It would bring us even tighter as a unit." ...|$|E

500|$|Some media commentators, such as Howard Kurtz and Toby Harnden, criticized {{what they}} {{perceived}} as {{a rush to judgment}} about the shooter's motivation, disputing suggestions that the shooting {{was the result of the}} Tea Party movement or anything in connection to Palin. Paul Krugman wrote an op-ed piece arguing that political rhetoric had become toxic. With renewed calls to tone down political rhetoric after the shooting, Keith Olbermann said, [...] "Violence, or the threat of violence, has no place in our Democracy, and I apologize for and repudiate any act or any <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> past that may have even inadvertently encouraged violence." [...] Jon Stewart stated that he did not know whether or not the political environment contributed to the shooting, but, [...] "For all the hyperbole and vitriol that's become a part of our political process—when the reality of that rhetoric, when actions match the disturbing nature of words, we haven't lost our capacity to be horrified. ... Maybe it helps us to remember to match our rhetoric with reality more often." ...|$|E

On October 19, Watson issued an apology; on October 25, he resigned from his position as chancellor. In 2008, Watson was appointed chancellor emeritus of CSHL. As of 2009, he continues to advise and guide project work at the laboratory. In a 2008 BBC documentary, Watson said: [...] "I have never {{thought of myself as}} a racist. I don't see myself as a racist. I am mortified by it. It was the worst <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] An editorial in Nature at the time acknowledged that his remarks were [...] "beyond the pale," [...] but wished that the tour had not been cancelled so that Watson would be forced to face his critics in person, encouraging scientific discussion on the matter.|$|E
2500|$|According to Kramer, every drama he {{has written}} derives from a desire to {{understand}} love's nature and its obstacles. Kramer became involved with movie production at age 23 by taking {{a job as a}} Teletype operator at Columbia Pictures, agreeing to the position only because the machine was across the hall from the president's office. Eventually, he won a position in the story department reworking scripts. His first writing credit was as a dialogue writer for Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush, a teen sex comedy. He followed that with the 1969 Oscar-nominated screenplay Women in Love, an adaptation of D. H. Lawrence's novel. He next penned what Kramer calls [...] "the only <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life I'm ashamed of," [...] the 1973 musical remake of Frank Capra's Lost Horizon, a notorious critical and commercial failure whose screenplay was based very closely on Capra's film. [...] Kramer has said that his well-negotiated fee for this work, skillfully invested by his brother, made him financially self-sufficient.|$|E
2500|$|Hughes {{was widely}} {{considered}} {{by those who}} knew him as a likeable and friendly person; a person who wanted to be liked. He said of himself when appointed captain of Australia, [...] "The one <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> favour is that I will never change. I hope I will always be a likeable enough, easy-to-get-along-with type of person." [...] His biographer noted, [...] "riends, team-mates, coaches, teachers, officials, close observers. Almost all mentioned Kim's niceness. He addresses people by their first name. He loves being around and encouraging children. He likes being people's best friend." [...] As captain Hughes was popular and obliging with the press and the public. English journalist Frank Keating said [...] "Pulled this way and that by photographers, fringers, high commissioners, low commissioners, book commissioners, and hall-porter commissioners, [...] never stopped being softly obliging." [...] The journalist Adrian McGregor said of Hughes, [...] "He was almost too amenable, too nice a guy. He was great with the media, would answer all sorts of questions, never told people to piss off. [...] It was almost like he didn't have the appropriate personality [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, Pattinson became romantically {{linked to}} co-star Kristen Stewart. For a long time, the two did not {{explicitly}} confirm a relationship, but paparazzi photographs and eyewitness accounts drove intense media and fan speculation and attention. However, Stewart officially acknowledged {{her relationship with}} Pattinson {{for the first time}} in July, 2012, when Us Weekly published photos of Stewart showing affection with her Snow White and the Huntsman director, Rupert Sanders, with what the Huffington Post called an [...] "affair." [...] The day that the photos were released, Stewart issued a public apology to Pattinson at People Magazine, saying, [...] "I'm deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I've caused to those close to me and everyone this has affected. This momentary indiscretion has jeopardized the most important <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, the person I love and respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love him, I'm so sorry." [...] After dodging the question repeatedly, Pattinson confirmed in an interview with Esquire UK in July 2014 that he and Stewart had split in 2012. There had been prior speculation that the couple broke up in May 2013, when Pattinson was seen removing personal items from Stewart's home.|$|E
2500|$|The Celibate Rifles {{signed to}} True Tone Records and, in April 1989, they issued Blind Ear. Steve Gardner of Noise for Heroes praised the album, [...] "yrically the band are {{obviously}} sharpening {{their focus on}} {{what ought to be}} fixed in the world, which is a great <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> book ... there's nothing better than words that cut set to music that rips [...] they are aware of global problems, and they're also aware of personal problems, and they sing about both with equal perception". It contained several singles, [...] "Johnny" [...] (February 1989), [...] "O Salvation!" [...] (June) and a double 7-inch with five tracks [...] "Wonderful Life", [...] "5 Lamps", [...] "Where the Action Is", [...] "She's So Fine", and [...] "Hot Stuff" [...] (March 1990). The band contributed a cover of John Paul Young's [...] "Where the Action Is" [...] to radio station 3RRR's Various Artists album, Used and Recovered By (1990). In October that year Hot Records issued a compilation album, Platters du Jour (English: Records of the Day), which featured a selection of rare early singles and EP sides with a limited edition 7-inch EP containing three unreleased tracks.|$|E
2500|$|Producer and pianist Sergio George {{helped to}} revive salsa's {{commercial}} {{success in the}} 1990s by mixing salsa with contemporary pop styles with Puerto Rican artists like Tito Nieves, La India, and Marc Anthony. George also produced the Japanese salsa band Orquesta de la Luz. Brenda K. Starr, Son By Four, Víctor Manuelle, and the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan enjoyed crossover success within the Anglo-American pop market with their Latin-influenced hits, usually sung in English. More often than not, clave was not a major consideration in the composing or arranging of these hits. Sergio George is up front and unapologetic about his attitude towards clave: [...] "Though clave is considered, {{it is not always}} the most important <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> music. The foremost issue in my mind is marketability. If the song hits, that's what matters. When I stopped trying to impress musicians and started getting in touch with what the people on the street were listening to, I started writing hits. Some songs, especially English ones originating in the United States, are at times impossible to place in clave." [...] As Washburne points out however, a lack of clave awareness does not always get a pass: ...|$|E

Björk talked about Kimono my House {{as one of}} the records that changed her life. [...] " [...] were exotic , [...] were the most refreshing <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life" [...] when she was eight. [...] "I loved the way Russell Mael sung like a geisha, and that they were into wearing geisha clothes, as I was really into Japanese people". Faith No More also mentioned the group and their performances. Their keyboard player Roddy Bottum said: [...] "I saw Sparks play on American Banstand in 1975. My sister and I went out and immediately bought Indiscreet. In 2004, Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos published an article in the NME titled, [...] "why I love the Sparks". He said about their music: [...] "It's only after a few listens you really can get into it [...] Then your really fall in love and bands change your life. Now I can't imagine life without them"."

2500|$|At {{the start}} of his career the England batting was fragile and Cowdrey never forgot that his wicket was too {{important}} to throw away, sometimes treating bowlers too cautiously for a man of his great talents, John Arlott commenting [...] "Cowdrey could sink into pits of uncertainty when the fire ceased to burn, allowing himself to be dominated by bowlers inferior to him in skill". Cowdrey himself thought that [...] "the proudest <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> career was that I kept surviving", playing Lindwall and Miller at 21 and Lillee and Thomson at 41, still able to move immaculately into line even though he hadn't played for months. His quick reflexes also made him an outstanding slip, whose 120 catches was a Test record for a fielder. In his youth, Cowdrey was a useful leg-spinner at club level, but only took 63 first-class wickets at a cost of 51.21 apiece. He claimed if Alan Knott hadn't misread a googly he would have picked up a Test wicket, though his son Chris wrote [...] "I can't see Knotty losing sleep over that one". In Cowdrey's last Test at Melbourne the fans famously hung out a banner 'M.C.G. FANS THANK COLIN – 6 TOURS', with Cowdrey [...] "wearing a large straw sun-hat ... signing endless autographs, posing for photographs and exchanging friendly talk with young and old in the way that has made him as popular a cricketer as has ever visited Australia".|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, Cuzzoni {{was still}} {{a force to be}} {{reckoned}} with. After the collapse of the Nobility Opera, she returned to the continent, singing in Florence in 1737-38, and at Turin the following year, when, for one carnival season, she received the huge fee of 8,000 lire. Later that year she sang at Vienna, and seems to have made her last operatic appearances in Hamburg in 1740. On 17 September 1741 the [...] "London Daily Post" [...] reported that Cuzzoni was to be beheaded for poisoning her husband, but, though they had separated by 1742, he did not die until 1748. She sang concerts in Amsterdam in 1742, and by December 1745 had become a court singer in Stuttgart. In debt, a condition she frequently suffered in her later life, she absconded from there to Bologna in 1748. Still needing to perform to pay her creditors, she was again in London in 1750, where Burney heard her [...] "thin cracked voice" [...] in a concert on 18 May. On 2 August of that year Horace Walpole wrote that [...] "old Cuzzoni" [...] had been arrested for a debt of £30, and bailed by the Prince of Wales. On 20 May 1751, the [...] "General Advertiser" [...] gave notice of a final benefit concert for Cuzzoni, accompanied by a letter from the singer in which she wrote: [...] "I am so extremely sensible of the many Obligations I have already received from the Nobility and Gentry of this Kingdom ... that nothing but extreme necessity and a desire of doing justice, could induce me to trouble them again, but being unhappily involved in a few Debts, am extremely desirous of attempting every <b>Thing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> Power to pay them, before I quit England ..." ...|$|E
