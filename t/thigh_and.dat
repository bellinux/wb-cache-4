5|$|At the 2010 Winter Olympics, Celski won bronze in the 1500m and the 5000m relay. Five {{months before}} the Olympics, Celski {{suffered}} a gruesome injury when he fell during a race and his right skate blade gashed his left <b>thigh</b> <b>and</b> was uncertain {{if he would be}} able to skate again.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{produced}} by cancer within the pelvis {{varies depending on}} the affected tissue. It may appear {{at the site of}} the cancer but it frequently radiates diffusely to the upper <b>thigh,</b> <b>and</b> may refer to the lower back, the external genitalia or perineum.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the six dead, thirteen other people were wounded by gunshot in the attack, while a fourteenth person was injured subduing Loughner. Gabrielle Giffords and two other members of her staff were among the surviving gunshot victims. Staffer Ron Barber, shot in the <b>thigh</b> <b>and</b> face, would later succeed Giffords in her House seat.|$|E

5|$|Inverse {{psoriasis}} (also {{known as}} flexural psoriasis) appears as smooth, inflamed patches of skin. The patches frequently affect skin folds, particularly around the genitals (between the <b>thigh</b> <b>and</b> groin), the armpits, {{in the skin}} folds of an overweight abdomen (known as panniculus), between the buttocks in the intergluteal cleft, and under the breasts in the inframammary fold. Heat, trauma, and infection are thought {{to play a role}} in the development of this atypical form of psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|Banks was {{determined}} to break the siege by a direct assault on the Confederate lines. Dow believed the attack to be a mistake, and delayed his units' participation until later in the day. In the assault, which was unsuccessful, Dow {{was wounded in the}} right arm and left <b>thigh</b> <b>and</b> sent to a nearby plantation to convalesce. While in the hospital, he lobbied for a transfer to a theater where his chances of promotion would be greater. On June 30, having healed enough to mount a horse again, Dow visited his troops. As he returned to the hospital after dark, he was captured by Confederate cavalry operating behind Union lines.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{was carried}} on a chair to the local tobacco shop, and from there {{he went to the}} hospital. He had {{sustained}} multiple fractures of his right <b>thigh,</b> <b>and</b> his doctors doubted he would race again. He transferred to a private clinic in Bologna, where his injured leg remained in a plaster cast for six months. Caracciola defied the predictions of his doctors and healed faster than expected, and in the winter Charlotte took her husband back to Arosa, where the altitude and fresh air would aid his recovery.|$|E

5|$|Emus are farmed {{primarily}} for their meat, leather, feathers and oil, and 95% of the carcass can be used. Emu meat is a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and {{is comparable to}} other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from the <b>thigh</b> <b>and</b> the larger muscles of the drum or lower leg) are, like other poultry, dark meat; emu meat is considered for cooking purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a red meat because its red colour and pH value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it {{is considered to be}} poultry.|$|E
5|$|Governor Johnson, {{despite his}} {{presumptive}} official position, his age (50), and a crippled arm, volunteered to serve under General John C. Breckinridge and Colonel Robert P. Trabue at the Battle of Shiloh. On April 7, Johnson was severely {{wounded in the}} <b>thigh</b> <b>and</b> abdomen, and lay on the battlefield until the following day. Johnson was recognized and helped by acquaintance and fellow Freemason, Alexander McDowell McCook, a Union general. However, Johnson died aboard the Union hospital ship Hannibal, and the provisional government of Kentucky was left leaderless.|$|E

Mhalsa is piercing a demon's chest with a spear, while a dog is biting his <b>thigh</b> <b>and</b> the horse is hitting his head. The other demon is grabbing the reins of the horse and attacking Khandoba with a club as Khandoba is dismounting the horse and attacking the demon with his sword. In other representations, Khandoba is seen seated on a horse with the heads of demons trod under the horse's hooves or their heads under Khandoba's knees.|$|E

5|$|More than 300individuals {{were injured}} during the raid, {{including}} women and children; {{some of them}} in critical condition. Injured protesters were taken to the Salmaniya Medical Complex, many of them with broken limbs and open wounds. Four individuals were killed by police using shotguns, from close range. While two of them who were shot in the back, another protester was shot in the <b>thigh</b> <b>and</b> subsequently died at the SMC; the fourth {{was shot in the head}} later and died instantly. At least 25,000mourners took part at the funeral procession, which was held in Sitra on 18February for the three protesters originating from the island.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Governor Johnson {{was seriously}} {{wounded in the}} right <b>thigh</b> <b>and</b> abdomen. He lay wounded on the {{battlefield}} until the next morning, when he was recognized by Union General Alexander McDowell McCook. Johnson and McCook had both attended the 1860 Democratic National Convention and were both Freemasons. Johnson was taken aboard the Union hospital ship Hannibal, where despite the ministrations of several physicians, he died on April 8. Friends in the Union army, including General John M. Harlan, packed Johnson's body in salt and shipped it to Louisville, then on to Georgetown for burial.|$|E
5|$|While {{the plane}} {{suffered}} relatively little damage, the suspect incurred {{first and second}} degree burns to his hands, as well as second-degree burns to his right inner <b>thigh</b> <b>and</b> genitalia. Two other passengers were also injured. When the plane landed, Abdulmutallab was handed over to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers, and taken into custody for questioning and treatment of his injuries in a secured room of the burn unit of the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor. Schuringa was also taken to the hospital. One other passenger incurred minor injuries.|$|E

5|$|Jamal {{was taken}} {{at first to}} the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. Dr. Ahmed Ghadeel said Jamal had {{received}} multiple wounds from high-velocity bullets striking his right elbow, right <b>thigh</b> <b>and</b> {{the lower part of}} both legs; his femoral artery was also cut. Talal Abu Rahma interviewed Jamal and the doctor there on camera the day after the shooting; Dr. Ghadeel displayed x-rays of Jamal's right elbow and right pelvis. Moshe Tamam, Jamal's Israeli employer, offered to have him taken to hospital in Tel Aviv, but the Palestinian Authority declined the offer. He was transferred instead to the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman, Jordan, where he was visited by King Abdullah. Jamal reportedly told Tamam that he had been hit by nine bullets; he said five were removed from his body in hospital in Gaza and four in Amman.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival at}} Ohio State, Lavelli roomed with Les Horvath and Don McCafferty and {{played on the}} {{freshman}} team under coach Trevor Rees. Brown switched Lavelli to end (the position is now called wide receiver). His playing time with the football team was limited, however, due to injury. He became a first-string end as a sophomore in 1942, but was ailing from a charley horse in his <b>thigh</b> <b>and</b> sat out {{the first game of}} the season against a Fort Knox military team. He had recovered by the third game of the season and started in a game against Southern California. Lavelli was hit in the knee while grabbing for a pass near the end of the game, however, and broke a bone. He was sidelined for the rest of the season. The Buckeyes won the college football national championship that year.|$|E
5|$|Parvati has a well-developed, round bosom and {{a narrow}} {{feminine}} waist embellished with various haras (religious bracelets) and other ornaments, made of diamonds and other gems. She has a fuller <b>thigh</b> <b>and</b> a curvier body and hip than the male {{part of the}} icon. The torso, hip and pelvis of the female is exaggerated to emphasize the anatomical differences between the halves. Though the male private parts may be depicted, the female genitalia are never depicted and the loins are always draped. She wears a multi-coloured or white silken garment down to her ankle and one or three girdles around her waist. The left half wears an anklet and her foot is painted red with henna. The left leg may be somewhat bent or straight, resting on a lotus pedestal. In contrast to the Shiva half, the Parvati half – smeared with saffron – is described as calm and gentle, parrot-green or dark in colour. She may be draped in a sari covering her torso and legs.|$|E

5|$|She was of one several Chinese ships {{caught in}} the harbour of Weihaiwei when the Japanese laid siege over the winter in early 1895 in the Battle of Weihaiwei. Huang refused to leave Jiyuan to seek {{treatment}} for injuries sustained during the battle; instead his wounds were dressed and he continued in his duties. He was then shot through the <b>thigh,</b> <b>and</b> continued to refuse treatment. A few minutes later {{he was killed by}} an explosive shell fired by a Japanese vessel. Admiral Ding Ruchang, in command of the fleet, surrendered on 12 February, and committing suicide shortly afterwards. In exchange for the surrender of all war material including the fleet, good behaviour was promised by the Japanese. Jiyuan was later commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy as Saien, the same Chinese character name.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} complication of proximal DVT is post-thrombotic syndrome, {{which is caused}} by a reduction in the return of venous blood to the heart. Some symptoms of post-thrombotic syndrome are pain, edema, paresthesia, and in severe cases, leg ulcers. An estimated 20–50% of those with DVT will develop it, and 5–10% will develop the severe form. PE is the most serious complication of proximal DVT, and the risk of PE is higher when clots are present in the <b>thigh</b> <b>and</b> pelvis. Distal DVT itself is hardly if ever associated with post-thrombotic syndrome or PE. Untreated lower extremity DVT has a 3% PE-related mortality rate, while deaths associated with upper extremity DVT are extremely rare. The presence of a remaining thrombus after a DVT frequently occurs in a minority of people, and it increases the risk of recurrence, though to a lesser extent than an elevated D-dimer. In the 10 years following a DVT, approximately a third of individuals will have a recurrent episode.|$|E
5|$|The son of Major Arthur Kerr Slessor and Adelaide Slessor (née Cotesworth), Slessor {{was born}} in Ranikhet, India, on 3 June 1897, and educated at Haileybury. Lame in both legs {{as a result of}} polio, he was {{rejected}} for army service in 1914 and only received a commission as a second lieutenant in the Royal Flying Corps on 6 July 1915 with the help of family connections. He was appointed to the Special Reserve as a flying officer on 9 September 1915, and confirmed in his rank of second lieutenant on 28 September. Slessor saw action with No. 17 Squadron in Egypt and the Sudan, where he was credited with arresting the escape of Sultan Ali Dinar and 2,000 men on 23 May 1916, following the Sultan's defeat at Beringia. He was mentioned in despatches on 25 October before being wounded in the <b>thigh</b> <b>and</b> invalided back to England.|$|E
