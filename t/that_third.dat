5|$|Early {{passenger}} carriages were of similar design {{to those used}} on railways in England at the time, holding eighteen passengers on first class carriages, and thirty on second class. Third class carriages originally had seats, but on 15 April 1840 a board decision declared that all future third class carriages were to be made without seats. All existing third class carriages also had their seats removed. A later board decision on 3 July 1840 ordered <b>that</b> <b>third</b> class carriages would be situated closest to the engine, followed by second class, with first class at the rear.|$|E
5|$|Solutions to Apollonius' problem {{generally}} {{occur in}} pairs; for each solution circle, {{there is a}} conjugate solution circle (Figure6). One solution circle excludes the given circles that are enclosed by its conjugate solution, and vice versa. For example, in Figure6, one solution circle (pink, upper left) encloses two given circles (black), but excludes a third; conversely, its conjugate solution (also pink, lower right) encloses <b>that</b> <b>third</b> given circle, but excludes the other two. The two conjugate solution circles are related by inversion, by the following argument.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the terminal was opposed by {{the residents of the}} Turtle Bay neighborhood, where it was planned to be located in, as it would have changed the character of their neighborhood. Turtle Bay residents wanted the terminal moved to Grand Central. They also disliked the proposed traffic congestion the new terminal would bring. The MTA contended that its studies had shown <b>that</b> <b>Third</b> Avenue was the only feasible place to put the terminal, and there would have been too great of a concentration of rail lines at Grand Central. It concluded that having the LIRR going to Grand Central would further strain the Lexington Avenue Line. If it were on Third Avenue, passengers would have been more inclined to use the Second Avenue Subway, which was partially under construction at the time. On April 16, 1973, a Federal directive directed New York State to consider expanding and modernizing Grand Central before building the new terminal under Third Avenue.|$|E

25|$|Leading off of (25)'s {{inability}} to have third and first person features, Kratzer {{builds on the}} idea <b>that</b> <b>third</b> person features may be gender features instead of person features. The subset principle, which determines that a word can be inserted into a position it may not belong in as long as subsets of the features in the position match the word, allows the introduction of first, second or third person features in relative pronouns. First, second, and third person features can thus have gender features, which in turn would account for a verbal agreement that requires the word following subset principle to obey.|$|E
25|$|After two wins {{to end the}} Twenty20 Cup, it {{was back}} to losing in the County Championship, going down to Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge for their eighth loss in nine games. In the National League, however, they jumped up to third place thanks to a five-wicket win over Worcestershire. However, they looked {{unlikely}} to advance further from <b>that</b> <b>third</b> place, as they went down to second-placed Middlesex at home in the National League, and Middlesex also defeated them in the County Championship encounter, as Glamorgan went down by an innings and 23 runs. They then achieved their second first-class draw of the season, in a three-day match with Bangladesh A where over half the match was lost to rain.|$|E
25|$|Late in {{the reign}} of Hadrian, c. AD 135, the numerus fort was {{replaced}} with a much larger (3.2 hectare) fort for a cohort, a unit of about 500 men. The new castle was reoriented to face the growing Roman city of Nida (now Heddernheim). Originally, it had dry-built wood-and stone walls, which were replaced in the 2nd half of the 2nd century with mortared stone walls and an earthen ramp (147 x 221 m). The reconstructed fort is based on <b>that</b> <b>third</b> and last architectural phase, but reminders of the second phase are visible in the retentura (the back of the fort). Part of the second-phase defensive ditch has also been restored and can be inspected there.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the race, Henri and Francis Pélissier were the best. They both finished before the rest in stage two, with Henri crossing the line first. In the third stage, Henri, leading the race, wanted to stop. Organizer Desgrange did all he could to change Pélissier's mind, and finally Pélissier started to race again. He was already 45 minutes behind, and the next three hours he was chasing the rest. He finally caught up, and finished second in the sprint, after his brother Francis. After that victory, Henri Pélissier said that he was a thoroughbred {{and the rest of the}} cyclists were work horses, which made the other cyclists angry. During <b>that</b> <b>third</b> stage, Léon Scieur punctured four times, and lost two hours.|$|E
25|$|Arrangements {{with the}} Bedouin left the scrolls {{in the hands}} of a third party until a {{profitable}} sale of them could be negotiated. <b>That</b> <b>third</b> party, George Isha'ya, was a member of the Syrian Orthodox Church, who soon contacted St Mark's Monastery in the hope of getting an appraisal of the nature of the texts. News of the find then reached Metropolitan Athanasius Yeshue Samuel, better known as Mar Samuel. After examining the scrolls and suspecting their antiquity, Mar Samuel expressed an interest in purchasing them. Four scrolls found their way into his hands: the now famous Isaiah Scroll (1QIsaa), the Community Rule, the Habakkuk Pesher (a commentary on the book of Habakkuk), and the Genesis Apocryphon. More scrolls soon surfaced in the antiquities market, and Professor Eleazer Sukenik and Professor Benjamin Mazar, Israeli archaeologists at Hebrew University, soon found themselves in possession of three, The War Scroll, Thanksgiving Hymns, and another, more fragmented, Isaiah scroll (1QIsab).|$|E
25|$|The IAEA has {{requested}} <b>that</b> <b>third</b> parties {{allow it to}} share the documents on the alleged studies with Iran. The IAEA has further stated that though it has not provided full documents containing the alleged studies, information from other countries has corroborated some of the allegations, which appear to the IAEA to be consistent and credible, and that Iran should therefore address the alleged studies even without obtaining the full documents. However, questions about {{the authenticity of the}} documents persist, with claims that the documents were obtained either from Israel or the MEK, an Iranian dissident group officially considered to be a terrorist organization by the United States, and that investigations into the alleged studies are intended to reveal intelligence about Iran's conventional weapons programs. Some IAEA officials have requested a clear statement be made by the agency that it could not affirm the documents' authenticity. They cite that as a key document in the study had since been proven to have been fraudulently altered, it put in doubt the entire collection.|$|E
