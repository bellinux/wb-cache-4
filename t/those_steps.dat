25|$|The {{process of}} invading the host cell, {{hijacking}} the cellular machinery, replication and final release {{is a complicated}} set of steps. Very specific proteins coded by the DNA of the infectious organism {{as well as the}} host cells allow <b>those</b> <b>steps</b> to happen. Even a very small change in a critical protein might make infection difficult or impossible. Such changes might arise by a process of mutation in the gene that codes for the protein. If the change is in the gamete, that is, the sperm or egg that join to form a zygote that grows into a human being, the protective mutation will be inherited. Since lethal diseases kill many persons who lack protective mutations, in time, many persons in regions where lethal diseases are endemic come to inherit protective mutations.|$|E
25|$|Syria {{fell into}} {{recession}} during the mid-1990s. Several years later, its economic growth was about 1.5 percent. This was insufficient, since population growth was between 3 and 3.5 percent. Another {{symptom of the}} crisis was statism in foreign trade. Syria's economic crisis coincided with recession in world markets. A 1998 drop in oil prices dealt a major blow to Syria's economy; when oil prices rose the following year, the Syrian economy partially recovered. In 1999, {{one of the worst}} droughts in a century caused a drop of 25–30 percent in crop yields compared with 1997 and 1998. Assad's government implemented emergency measures, including loans and compensation to farmers and the distribution of free fodder to save sheep and cattle.

25|$|The {{production}} process of TV dinners is highly automated and undergoes three major steps. <b>Those</b> <b>steps</b> are food preparation, tray loading, and freezing. During food preparation, {{vegetables and fruits}} are usually placed on a movable belt and washed, then are placed into a container to be steamed or boiled for 1–3 minutes. This process {{is referred to as}} blanching, and is used as a method to destroy enzymes in the food that can cause chemical changes negatively affecting overall flavor and color of the fruit and vegetables. As for meats, prior to cooking, they are trimmed of fat and cut into proper sizes. The fish is usually cleaned and cut into fillets, and poultry is usually washed thoroughly and dressed. Meats are then seasoned, placed on trays, and are cooked in an oven for a predetermined amount of time. After all the food is ready to be packaged, it is sent to the filling lines. The food is placed in its compartments as the trays pass under numerous filling machines; to ensure that every packaged dinner gets an equal amount of food, the filling devices are strictly regulated.|$|E

2500|$|The Project for Restructuring the Brazilian Electric Sector, RESEB, which {{laid down}} the first steps for the {{implementation}} of the power sector reform, was initiated in 1996 during the administration of President Cardoso. The objective of the reform was to build a more competitive power sector with the creation of a level playing field for private sector participation. In addition, state-owned utilities and assets were privatized. Although transmission assets were not privatized, most of the expansion of the transmission network has been carried out by private capital. This reform also led to the creation, in 1996, of ANEEL (Brazil's National Electricity Regulatory Agency), a quasi-independent regulatory body in charge of overseeing the electricity sector. However, the main restructuring steps were taken with the enactment of the 1998 Law (Law 9648/98). <b>Those</b> <b>steps</b> included the creation of an independent operator of the national transmission system (ONS) and an operator of the commercial market (MAE), which did not become operational until 2001.|$|E
2500|$|In short, such patents, {{although}} frequently {{dressed up}} in the argot of invention, simply describe a problem, announce purely functional steps that purport to solve the problem, and recite standard computer operations to perform some of <b>those</b> <b>steps.</b> The principal flaw in these patents {{is that they do}} not contain an “inventive concept” that solves practical problems and ensures that the patent is directed to something “significantly more than” the ineligible abstract idea itself. See CLS Bank, 134 S. Ct. at 2355, 2357; Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at 1294. As such, they represent little more than functional descriptions of objectives, rather than inventive solutions. In addition, because they describe the claimed methods in functional terms, they preempt any subsequent specific solutions to the problem at issue. See CLS Bank, 134 S. Ct. at 2354; Mayo, 132 S. Ct. at 1301-02. It is for those reasons that the Supreme Court has characterized such patents as claiming “abstract ideas” and has held that they are not directed to patentable subject matter.|$|E

5000|$|Heraclitan: The Greek philosopher Heraclitus {{used the}} metaphor of a river to speak of change thus, [...] "On <b>those</b> <b>stepping</b> into rivers staying the same other and other waters flow" [...] (DK22B12).
