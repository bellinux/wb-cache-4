5|$|Canadian {{explorer}} David Thompson {{first recorded}} the Native American {{name of the}} Snake River as Shawpatin {{when he arrived at}} its mouth by boat in 1800. When <b>the</b> <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition crossed westwards into the Snake River watershed in 1805, they first gave it the name Lewis River, Lewis Fork or Lewis's Fork, as Meriwether Lewis was the first of their group to sight the river.|$|E
5|$|Commerce {{after the}} Louisiana Purchase {{remained}} {{focused on the}} fur trade; operations in St. Louis were led by the Chouteau family and its alliance with the Osages and by Manuel Lisa and his Missouri Fur Company. Due to {{its role as a}} major trading post, the city was the departure point for <b>the</b> <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition in 1804.|$|E

5|$|In 1804, President Thomas Jefferson {{commissioned}} <b>the</b> <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> {{expedition to}} explore the Louisiana Territory and beyond. Although the expedition passed only near the Gladstone – Oregon City locality {{on their way to}} and from the Pacific Ocean, via the Columbia River, natives such as the Kalapuya and the Clackamas people told them about the area.|$|E
5|$|In late 1805 {{and early}} 1806, members of <b>the</b> <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition spotted Mount St. Helens from the Columbia River {{but did not}} report either an ongoing {{eruption}} or recent evidence of one. They did however report the presence of quicksand and clogged channel conditions {{at the mouth of}} the Sandy River near Portland, suggesting an eruption by Mount Hood sometime in the previous decades.|$|E
5|$|The coin {{was first}} {{suggested}} {{as a replacement}} for the Susan B. Anthony dollar, which proved useful for vending machine operators and mass transit systems despite being unpopular with the public. The Statue of Liberty was originally proposed as the design subject, but Sacagawea, the Shoshone guide of <b>the</b> <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition, was eventually chosen.|$|E

5|$|Floyd {{was born}} at Floyds Station, Virginia, near what is now Louisville, Kentucky. His parents were pioneer John Floyd, who was killed by Native Americans twelve days before his son's birth, and Jane Buchanan. His first cousin was Charles Floyd, {{the only member of}} <b>the</b> <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition to die. In a letter dated 15 December 1830, Sam Houston stated that Floyd was the first cousin of another Lewis and Clark Explorer, Nathaniel Pryor.|$|E
5|$|In 1804, {{fifty years}} before the city of Omaha was founded, <b>the</b> <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition first arrived via the Missouri River. The 1806 Fort Lisa and 1820 Cabanne's Trading Post were {{important}} fur trading outposts located in proximity to the river, along with earlier Fontenelle's Post in Bellevue. The Engineer Cantonment was built by Captain Stephen Watts Kearny's Yellowstone Expedition in 1819. The Expedition's craft, the Western Engineer, was the first steamboat to successfully venture up the Missouri River to the Omaha-Council Bluffs area.|$|E
5|$|In 1805, on {{the journey}} westward down the Columbia, <b>the</b> <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition {{recorded}} seeing the mountain; noting that it was “a high mountain of emence hight covered with snow” and thought it “perhaps the highest pinnacle in America.” They initially misidentified it as Mount St. Helens, which had been previously discovered and named by George Vancouver. On the return journey in 1806, they recorded seeing both, but did not give Adams a name, only calling it “a very high humped mountain”. This is the earliest recorded sighting of the volcano by European explorers.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, the forest was visited by {{mountain}} men and explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger. Colter {{is the first}} white man known to have visited both the Yellowstone region and the forest, which he did between 1807 and 1808. Having been an original member of <b>the</b> <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition, Colter requested permission from Meriwether Lewis to leave the expedition after it had finished crossing the Rocky Mountains during their return journey from the Pacific Ocean. Colter teamed up with two unaffiliated explorers the expedition had encountered, but soon thereafter decided to explore regions south of where his new partners wished to venture. Traveling first into the northeastern region of what is today Yellowstone National Park, Colter then explored the Absaroka Mountains, crossing over Togwotee Pass and entering the valley known today as Jackson Hole. Colter survived a grizzly bear attack and a pursuit by a band of Blackfeet Indians who had taken his horse. The explorer later provided William Clark, who had been his commander on <b>the</b> <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition, with previously unknown information on the regions he had explored, which Clark published in 1814.|$|E
5|$|Spain and the United States both sought allies {{among the}} Native Americans of the disputed territory. In June 1806, Lieutenant Facundo Melgares and 600 men were {{dispatched}} from the Spanish provincial capital of Santa Fe down the Red River and then northward into present-day Nebraska. Although no Spanish {{records of the}} Melgares expedition are known to exist, {{it is believed that}} its purpose was to find and arrest <b>the</b> <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> party, and to establish alliances with the Native Americans of the region, including the Pawnees.|$|E
5|$|The coyote {{was first}} scientifically {{described}} by Thomas Say, a naturalist, in September 1819 {{on the site}} of Lewis and Clark's Council Bluffs, 15 miles up the Missouri River {{from the mouth of the}} Platte during a government-sponsored expedition with Major Stephen Long. He had the first edition of <b>the</b> <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> journals in hand, which contained Biddle's edited version of Lewis's observations dated May 5, 1805. His account was published in 1823.|$|E
50|$|The {{area is a}} part of <b>the</b> {{proposed}} <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Mount Hood Wilderness {{which would}} prevent development, logging, mining, and possibly require the removal of structures and roads.|$|R
50|$|The Teton {{people had}} already shown {{resistance}} to <b>the</b> expedition. <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> gradually adjusted their goals, working to form alliances with the Arikara, Hidatsa, and Mandan against the Teton.|$|R
25|$|Since <b>the</b> expedition, <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> {{have been}} commemorated and honored {{over the years}} on various coins, currency, and {{commemorative}} postage stamps, {{as well as in}} a number of other capacities.|$|R
5|$|The park is {{bordered on}} the north by Waterton Lakes National Park in Alberta, and the Flathead Provincial Forest and Akamina-Kishinena Provincial Park in British Columbia. To the west, the north fork of the Flathead River forms the western boundary, while its middle fork {{is part of the}} {{southern}} boundary. The Blackfeet Indian Reservation provides most of the eastern boundary. <b>The</b> <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> and the Flathead National Forests form the southern and western boundary. The remote Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex is located in the two forests immediately to the south.|$|E
5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition {{reached the}} Platte in 1804, {{they found the}} Kitkehahkis (whom they mistakenly called Arapahos) living there. They {{were told that the}} band had {{returned}} to the Republican about ten years before (that is, before the conflict with the Omahas), but had recently moved to the Platte under pressure from the Kanzas. By 1806, however, the Kitkehahkis were at peace with the Kanzas, and were once again living on the Republican.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of human {{settlement}} of the Americas, the California condor was widespread across North America; condor bones from the late Pleistocene have been found at the Cutler Fossil Site in southern Florida. However, {{at the end of}} the last glacial period came the extinction of the megafauna that led to a subsequent reduction in range and population. Five hundred years ago, the California condor roamed across the American Southwest and West Coast. Faunal remains of condors have been found documented in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas. <b>The</b> <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition of the early 19th century reported on their sighting and shooting of California condors near the mouth of the Columbia River.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1805, {{just after}} {{crossing}} the Continental Divide of <b>the</b> Americas, <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> ventured down <b>the</b> Salmon River, but {{found it to}} be too rough to be navigable. Clark wrote: ...|$|R

5|$|In 1937, Stackpole {{received}} {{a commission to}} sculpt his interpretation of Colorado River explorer John Wesley Powell, for display in the Main Interior Building of the U.S. Department of Interior. It {{was to be a}} companion piece to Heinz Warneke's portrayal of <b>the</b> <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> Expedition. Warneke learned that Stackpole intended a water scene, so he changed his portrayal of Lewis and Clark {{to be one of them}} on land. Stackpole and Warneke delivered their stone reliefs in 1940, and the two panels were mounted on either side of the stage of the building's auditorium.|$|E
5|$|Later American explorers, some of {{whom were}} {{originally}} part of <b>the</b> <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> expedition, journeyed into the Snake River watershed and records show a variety of names have been associated with the river. The explorer Wilson Price Hunt of the Astor Expedition named the river as Mad River. Others gave the river names including Shoshone River (after the tribe) and Saptin River. Eventually, the name Snake River was derived from an S-shaped gesture the Shoshone tribe made with their hands to represent swimming salmon. Explorers misinterpreted it to represent a snake, giving the river its present-day name.|$|E
5|$|Other areas {{managed by}} the National Park Service include Jewel Cave National Monument near Custer, <b>the</b> <b>Lewis</b> <b>and</b> <b>Clark</b> National Historic Trail, the Minuteman Missile National Historic Site, which {{features}} a decommissioned nuclear missile silo and a separate missile control area several miles away, and the Missouri National Recreational River. The Crazy Horse Memorial is a large mountainside sculpture near Mt. Rushmore being built with private funds. The Mammoth Site near Hot Springs is another privately owned attraction in the Black Hills. A working paleontological dig, the site {{has one of the}} world's largest concentrations of mammoth remains.|$|E
