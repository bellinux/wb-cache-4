5|$|Wehha is a semi-historical {{figure and}} no {{surviving}} evidence has survived {{to show he}} actually existed or was ever king of the East Angles. The name Wehha is included in tallies of the ruling Wuffingas dynasty: the name appears as Ƿehh Ƿilhelming - Wehha Wilhelming - in the East Anglian tally from the Textus Roffensis, an important collection of Anglo-Saxon laws and Rochester Cathedral registers that has survived {{in the form of}} two distinct books that were bound together in the 13th century. According to this list, which is also known as the Anglian collection, Wehha was <b>the</b> <b>son</b> of Wilhelm, who was <b>the</b> <b>son</b> of Hryþ, who was <b>the</b> <b>son</b> of Hroðmund, <b>the</b> <b>son</b> of Trygil, <b>the</b> <b>son</b> of Tyttman, <b>the</b> <b>son</b> of Casere Odisson, <b>the</b> <b>son</b> of the god Wōden. Wehha's son Wuffa, after whom the Wuffingas dynasty is named, is also listed.|$|E
