5|$|Some historians {{emphasize}} that the leagues were engaged in class struggle against a coalition of landowners and mafiosi and ignore evidence of strategic alliances between the Fasci and <b>the</b> <b>Mafia.</b> The leagues were not only led by socialists and anarchists; some were run by local gentry and mafiosi. <b>The</b> <b>Mafia</b> bosses Vito Cascioferro and Nunzio Giaimo led the Fasci in Bisacquino in alliance with Verro. <b>The</b> <b>Mafia</b> was sometimes needed to enforce flying pickets with credible threats of violence {{and to make the}} strike costly to landowners by destroying their property.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, he was {{the first}} to publish a {{detailed}} map of the Sicilian Mafia, which was confirmed 22 years later by <b>the</b> <b>Mafia</b> pentito (turncoat) Tommaso Buscetta in his testimony to Judge Giovanni Falcone. In January 1962 he published a series of articles in L'Ora disclosing the testimony of Melchiorre Allegra, a medical doctor and a member of <b>the</b> <b>Mafia</b> from 1916 until his arrest in 1937. Upon being arrested, Allegra disclosed his membership and testified about Mafia activities. It was one of the first testimonies about <b>the</b> <b>Mafia</b> from within, but the document had been neglected until De Mauro republished it.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Mafia</b> of Villalba was of {{relatively}} recent origin, {{as it did}} {{not go back to}} the 1860s, considered to be the period when <b>the</b> <b>Mafia</b> emerged around Palermo. It started as a form of private protection and {{has little to do with}} large estates as was the case in many other rural areas where many mafiosi started as caretakers and lease-holders (gabelloto or bailiff) for absentee landlords.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Bosnian <b>Mafia</b> can be broadly {{divided into}} four {{categories}} - <b>the</b> Bosniak <b>Mafia,</b> <b>the</b> Bosnian Serb <b>Mafia,</b> <b>the</b> Bosnian Croat <b>Mafia</b> and many local organised-crime groups. <b>The</b> Bosnian <b>Mafia</b> groups {{are involved in a}} wide range of activities; one of their more notorious activities occurred in 2003 when they smuggled and sold 250,000 Zastava M70 Yugoslav-made AK-47s to Iraq.|$|R

5|$|The rally {{began in}} late afternoon. Vizzini {{had agreed to}} permit the meeting as long as land problems, the large estates, or <b>the</b> <b>Mafia</b> were not addressed. Both {{speakers}} who preceded Li Causi, among which was Pantaleone, followed Vizzini’s commands. Li Causi did not. He denounced the unjust exploitation by <b>the</b> <b>Mafia,</b> and when Li Causi started {{to talk about how}} the peasants were being deceived by ‘a powerful leaseholder’ – a thinly disguised reference to Vizzini – <b>the</b> <b>Mafia</b> boss hurled: It’s a lie. Pandemonium broke out. The rally ended in a shoot-out which left 14 people wounded including Li Causi and Pantaleone. Six months later Vizzini acquired the lease for the Miccichè estate.|$|E

Fat Tony, the leader of <b>the</b> <b>Mafia,</b> and his henchmen Legs and Louie are initially inhospitable towards Bart, but they are impressed by his ability to pick the winning horse in a horse race on the radio. When Bart makes up an excellent Manhattan cocktail for the mobsters, Fat Tony hires him as their bartender and errand boy. As Bart adopts more and more gangster-like traits, Marge grows anxious and tells Homer to go and meet <b>the</b> <b>Mafia,</b> but Homer approves of them after they let him win at poker.|$|E
5|$|Buscetta {{claimed that}} Mafia boss Stefano Bontade {{organized}} De Mauro’s kidnap, because his {{investigations into the}} death of Mattei {{came very close to}} <b>the</b> <b>Mafia,</b> and Bontade’s own role in the affair. Another pentito, Francesco Di Carlo, declared in 2001 that De Mauro was killed because he had learned that one of his former fascist friends, Prince Junio Valerio Borghese, was planning a coup d'état (the so-called Golpe Borghese) with like-minded army officers determined to stop what they considered as Italy's drift to the left. Yet another pentito, Rosario Naimo, who started to collaborate with the Italian authorities after his arrest in October 2010, said that the journalist was killed because of his investigative reporting that damaged <b>the</b> <b>Mafia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> Colombian <b>mafias</b> and {{especially}} <b>the</b> Medellín Cartel imposed a modality of crime with the hired killers ("sicarios" [...] in Spanish) to murder political opponents or any authority {{that could put}} in danger their dirty business. What became astonishing was that <b>the</b> <b>mafias</b> were contracting teenagers from the slums of the big cities. Boys from marginalized barrios (and many cases also girls), became killing machines ready to murder for the service of <b>the</b> <b>mafias.</b> Pablo Escobar, {{in the middle of}} his war against the Colombian authorities in the 1990s, offered three to five million pesos (about USD 5,280 y 8,800 of 1990 currency) to anybody who would kill an official of the Police.

5|$|A {{few days}} later, the shark kills {{a young boy}} named Alex Kintner and an old man {{not far from the}} shore. A local fisherman, Ben Gardner, is sent by Amity's {{authorities}} to kill the shark but disappears on the water. Brody and deputy Leonard Hendricks find Gardner's boat anchored off-shore, empty, and covered with large bite holes, one of which has a massive shark tooth stuck in it. Blaming himself for these deaths, Brody again tries to close the beaches, while Meadows investigates the Mayor's business contacts to determine why he wants to keep the beaches open. Meadows uncovers links to <b>the</b> <b>Mafia,</b> who pressure Vaughn to keep the beaches open {{in order to protect the}} value of Amity's real estate, in which <b>the</b> <b>Mafia</b> invested a great deal of money. Meadows also recruits marine biologist Matt Hooper from the Woods Hole Institute to advise them on how to deal with the shark.|$|E

5|$|Before {{entering}} production, Kill the Irishman had {{a troubled}} development stage that lasted over a decade.
