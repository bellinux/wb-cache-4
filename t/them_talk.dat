25|$|On 15 May 2011, Laurie was {{the subject}} of the ITV series Perspectives, {{explaining}} his love for the music of New Orleans and playing music, from his album Let <b>Them</b> <b>Talk,</b> at studios and live venues in the city itself. He {{was the subject}} of PBS Great Performances Let <b>them</b> <b>Talk,</b> also about New Orleans jazz, first broadcast on 30 September 2011.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday afternoons {{when we went}} {{calling on}} the older {{generation}} of relatives, {{those who had been}} active in the Sixties, I sat on the bony knees of veterans and the fat slippery laps of great aunts and heard <b>them</b> <b>talk.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 26 July 2010, it was {{announced}} that Laurie would be releasing a blues album after signing a contract with Warner Bros. Records.

25|$|The film {{consists}} of a fluent succession of fifty short sketches, most with a tragicomic undertone. The cast is mostly non-professional, and alienating techniques are employed such as presenting the characters in grim make-up and having <b>them</b> <b>talk</b> directly to camera. The financing was difficult and the shooting took three years to complete. The film won the Silver Hugo Award for Best Direction at the 2007 Chicago International Film Festival and has received critical acclaim.|$|E
25|$|Barton quickly {{recognized}} them, as she {{had grown}} up with some of them, and some she had even taught. Barton, along with several other women, personally provided clothing, food, and supplies for the sick and wounded soldiers. She learned how to store and distribute medical supplies and offered emotional support to the soldiers by keeping their spirits high. She would read books to them, write letters to their families for <b>them,</b> <b>talk</b> to them, and support them.|$|E
25|$|Outside acting, Laurie has {{released}} two blues albums, Let <b>Them</b> <b>Talk</b> and Didn't It Rain (2013), both to favourable reviews - and has authored a novel, The Gun Seller, published in 1996. Among his honours, Laurie {{has won three}} Golden Globe Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards and has been nominated for ten Primetime Emmy Awards. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2007, for services to drama, and was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2016.|$|E

25|$|Rather than {{ending with}} the {{conviction}} and sentencing to prison of the five Watergate burglars on January 30, 1973, {{the investigation into the}} break-in and the Nixon Administration's involvement grew broader. Nixon's conversations in late March and all of April 1973 revealed that not only did he know he needed to remove Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Dean to gain distance from them, but he had to do so {{in a way that was}} least likely to incriminate him and his presidency. Nixon created a new conspiracy—to effect a cover-up of the cover-up—which began in late March 1973 and became fully formed in May and June 1973, operating until his presidency ended on August 9, 1974. On March 23, 1973, Judge Sirica read the court a letter from Watergate burglar James McCord, who alleged that perjury had been committed in the Watergate trial, and defendants had been pressured to remain silent. Trying to make <b>them</b> <b>talk,</b> Sirica gave Hunt and two burglars provisional sentences of up to 40 years.|$|E
500|$|The {{first song}} she wrote was [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] {{and in an}} {{interview}} with Faze, she revealed that writing songs in English proved to be challenging for her: [...] "I prayed and asked God to send me a good song today, and I remember I started writing the song [...] a couple of hours after. I wrote the music and lyrics at the same time, and when that happens it's really magical to me." [...] After completing [...] "Objection (Tango)", Shakira decided to write ten more songs and began setting up portable recording studios in the rural region of Uruguay. She wrote various songs with a [...] "dictionary {{in one hand and a}} thesaurus in the other." [...] During the songwriting process, Shakira wrote [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] as a love song for de la Rúa. She explained that, [...] "If you check the subject of my songs, most of <b>them</b> <b>talk</b> about my own experiences and feelings and what I was actually going through in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} 1974. The budget was $1.5 million. Pre-production lasted one week, including casting. Grittier sequences were {{shot on the}} streets of New York City, while less serious locations were shot on Warner Bros.' sound stages in Los Angeles. According to Bakshi, [...] "What I would do is dress guys up, live-action guys. Very strange dudes! The weirdest guys I could find. Having <b>them</b> <b>talk</b> to animated characters in front of candy stores, discussing girlfriends and such. It was very surrealistic." [...] Yaphet Kotto and the glam punk band New York Dolls were cast in the live action sequences, with the New York Dolls playing homosexuals. Mean Streets actors Richard Romanus and David Proval were cast as the voices of Vinnie and Crazy Shapiro. Much of the shooting of live action sequences and recording of animated dialogue involved improvisation, with Bakshi setting up the premise of the scene and allowing his actors to create their own dialogue. During the [...] "rumble" [...] sequence, the actors playing the Chaplains were filmed popping and performing styles of dance which later evolved into breakdancing, dance styles which were unheard of in the 1970s studio system.|$|E
6000|$|... "Or at least, try {{to forgive}} and forget <b>them.</b> <b>Talking</b> <b>them</b> over only deepens {{the sense of}} them, and discussions do no good to any one. My daughters are anxious to be your best friends, as I hope you know." ...|$|R
60|$|When I {{heard this}} I {{answered}} him back, but Jan and Ralph went away, and presently I found <b>them</b> <b>talking</b> together outside the laager.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've lived a {{good many}} years," [...] he said, [...] "but I never heerd <b>'em</b> <b>talked</b> up to like that. You're my {{candidate}} for governor." ...|$|R
500|$|Pierce {{returned}} to the horror genre with the 1976 film The Town That Dreaded Sundown, based on {{the true story of}} the Phantom Killer, an unidentified serial killer who murdered five people in Texarkana in 1946. Pierce remembered being scared by news stories about the killer during his youth in Hampton. He received some criticism for the graphic violence portrayed in the film, particularly one scene where the killer ties a woman to a tree, attaches a knife {{to the end of a}} trombone, then repeatedly stabs her while playing the instrument. Pierce said he purposely made the film violent because he felt the real-life situation was horrific and did not want to glaze over it. While filming horror scenes, he tried to create a suspenseful mood by clearing the set of only the essential cast and staff, then refusing to let <b>them</b> <b>talk</b> to each other as the scenes were shot. Pierce appeared in The Town That Dreaded Sundown as police Patrolman A.C. [...] "Spark Plug" [...] Benson, an idiotic comic relief character. The name [...] "Spark Plug" [...] was a real-life nickname given to the director due to his energy. Pierce described The Town That Dread Sundown as a very easy and enjoyable shoot with no major problems on the set.|$|E
2500|$|Sportswriters {{extended}} on the idea. Shulman {{wrote in}} 1930 of hearing <b>them</b> <b>talk</b> about short pop flies as [...] "Chinese line drives". Texas leaguers, or high bloop singles that fell between the infielders and outfielders, hit in Pacific Coast League games were likewise called [...] "Japanese line drives".|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, Jones {{appeared}} as guest vocalist on the debut album Let <b>Them</b> <b>Talk</b> by Hugh Laurie. On 15 May 2011 he appeared alongside Laurie in the UK ITV series Perspectives, singing {{music from the}} album in New Orleans. [...] On 25 May 2011, he appeared on [...] American Idol [...] after a medley of his hits performed by the American Idol [...] "Top 13".|$|E

60|$|He {{could hear}} <b>them</b> <b>talking</b> in low, earnest tones; but was so engrossed {{by his own}} {{thoughts}} that he {{made no attempt to}} distinguish the words.|$|R
2500|$|In 2005, Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil, who {{hails from}} Rajpipla in the Gujarat, {{publicly}} {{came out as}} gay. He was quickly anointed by the Indian and the world media as the first openly gay royal. He was disinherited as an immediate reaction by the royal family, though they eventually reconciled. He appeared on the American talk show The Oprah Winfrey Show on October 24, 2007, and on BBC Three's Undercover Princes. In 2008, Zoltan Parag, a competitor at the Mr. Gay International contest {{said that he was}} apprehensive about returning to India. He said, [...] "Indian media has exposed me so much that now when I call my friends back home, their parents do not let <b>them</b> <b>talk</b> to me".|$|E
2500|$|In a stark {{contrast}} to his previous films, Shyamalan's name was notably absent from trailers, TV commercials, and marketing signage. Instead, Sony Pictures opted to feature Will and Jaden Smith prominently in the marketing campaign. Sony's worldwide marketing and distribution chairman, Jeff Blake, said that [...] "Night is, without a doubt, a world-class filmmaker who we were thrilled to team up with on this project," [...] but [...] "Together, we decided to focus our campaign on both the action and Will and Jaden given that 'After Earth' is an adventure story of a father and son." [...] Alex Suskind of Moviefone pointed out to Shyamalan that After Earth was not being marketed on the strength of his name unlike his previous projects, to which he responded, [...] "There's such a specific expectation that comes with a name. It's nice to have people watch the movie and then have <b>them</b> <b>talk</b> about the storyteller; it's a healthy balance." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{term was}} coined by Angular Records founder Joe Daniel and was {{featured}} on the [...] "An Angular Disco" [...] flyer used to advertise Klaxons's first gig. Klaxons later declared they were not new rave, describing it as a [...] "joke that's got out of hand" [...] and that the term was originally ironic, not serious. In reaction to the media overkill of the [...] "genre", Klaxons banned the use of glowsticks at their gigs in April 2007, saying that [...] "We kept getting asked to explain it. The whole idea of new rave {{was to take the}} piss out of the media by making <b>them</b> <b>talk</b> about something that didn't exist, just for our own amusement. And they'd say, I appreciate that, but can you tell me more about new rave?" [...] Los Angeles Times critic Margaret Wappler comments that the [...] "minimalist dance-punk of LCD Soundsystem, the analog classicism of Simian Mobile Disco, the fanatical electro-thrash of Justice, the international amalgam of M.I.A., the agitated funk of [...] (Chk Chk Chk) and the art-schooled disco-sleaze of Cansei de Ser Sexy" [...] contributed to the thriving 'new rave' dance scene, which led to a rediscovery of indie rockers, and a critical and intellectual revolution in dance music.|$|E

2500|$|Later on, Regina makes a potion {{that links}} {{the magic of}} two Saviors, and once Emma drinks it, she {{will be able to}} track Aladdin. They follow his traces to a {{cemetery}} crypt, where Jasmine is devastated to find the scarab, believing Aladdin had died and Emma worried about her fate. When Emma and Henry have a conversation about what the future holds for them, Aladdin appears out of hiding, admitting that he used the scarab to throw them off, but heard <b>them</b> <b>talk</b> so he changed his mind. Aladdin explains that he ended up using the shears that ultimately doomed Agrabah. He gives the shears to Emma, letting her choose if she wants to use them someday. Emma and Henry then convince Aladdin to go back to Jasmine, but the reunion is cut short when Jasmine explains that she needs his help to defend Agrabah again, only to have Aladdin try to explain his reason why he might not. As for the fate shears, Emma gives them to Hook, who plans to bury them [...] "20,000 Leagues under the sea." [...] Unfortunately, after Emma kissed him as she is about to order dinner, Hook lied to her as he kept the fate shears inside his jacket.|$|E
