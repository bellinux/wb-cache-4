In this case the oxidizer passes through coke and (more likely) ashes to the reaction zone where it interacts with coal.

Thus, the gas requires significant refining before being used in the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. Products of the refinement are highly toxic and require special facilities for their utilization. As a result, the plant utilizing the described technologies has to be very large to be economically efficient. One of such plants called SASOL is situated in the Republic of South Africa (RSA). It was built due to embargo applied to the country preventing it from importing oil and natural gas.

30|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{a primary}} malignant tumor of the liver that accounts for an important health problem worldwide. Only 10 – 15 % of HCC patients are suitable candidates for hepatic resection and liver transplantation due to the advanced stage of the disease at time of diagnosis and shortage of donors. Therefore, several minimally invasive image-guided therapies for locoregional treatment have been developed. Tumor ablative techniques are either based on <b>thermal</b> tumor <b>destruction,</b> as in radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, microwave ablation, laser ablation and high-intensity focused ultrasound, or chemical tumor destruction, as in percutaneous ethanol injection.

Several methods for chemical or <b>thermal</b> tumor <b>destruction</b> have been developed and tested clinically {{during the past two}} decades. The seminal technique used for local treatment of HCC has been percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI). Several studies have provided indirect evidence that PEI improves the natural history of nonsurgical patients with early-stage HCC. Its major limitation is the high rate of local recurrence. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation has been the most widely assessed alternative to PEI. Five randomized controlled trials have shown that RF ablation achieves more effective and reproducible tumor destruction than PEI, leading to a better local control of the disease. As a result, RF ablation has been established as the primary ablative modality.

In spite of various methods have been developed for the separation and purification of enzymes, most of them involved a number of steps and furthermore the scale up of these methods is difficult and also expensive to produce in large scale.

50|$|The {{behavior}} of quantum dots (QDs) in solution and their interaction with other surfaces {{is of great}} importance to biological and industrial applications, such as optical displays, animal tagging, anti-counterfeiting dyes and paints, chemical sensing, and fluorescent tagging. However, unmodified quantum dots tend to be hydrophobic, which precludes their use in stable, water-based colloids. Furthermore, because the ratio of surface area to volume in a quantum dot {{is much higher than}} for larger particles, the thermodynamic free energy associated with dangling bonds on the surface is sufficient to impede the quantum confinement of excitons. Once solubilized by encapsulation in either a hydrophobic interior micelle or a hydrophilic exterior micelle, the QDs can be successfully introduced into an aqueous medium, in which they form an extended hydrogel network. In this form, quantum dots can be utilized in several applications that benefit from their unique properties, such as medical imaging and <b>thermal</b> <b>destruction</b> of malignant cancers.|$|E

40|$|This study {{represents}} a preliminary {{evaluation of the}} effect of steam dilution and hydrogen addition on the oxidation of formaldehyde and benzene, chosen as representative of the Volatile Organic Compounds, in Mild condition by evaluating the autoignition time and the steady state attainment. These parameters are important in the design of <b>thermal</b> VOC <b>destruction</b> plants since they influence the abatement efficiency and, therefore, the plant dimension. It came out that steam dilution implies lower autoignition times and, on the other hand, longer times for the attainment of the steady state. In contrast, for very high water content there is an increase of the autoignition time. This implies that there is an optimum value of steam content that allows for the attainment of the steady state condition by the lowest residence time. Hydrogen addition to systems diluted in nitrogen promotes the oxidation reactions and anticipates the steady state condition. In in steam diluted systems hydrogen delays the autoignition of the mixtures even though anticipates the attainment of the complete destruction of the VOC. The rate of production analysis showed that the H 2 /O 2 reactions that promote the ignition and the destruction of VOC are sensibly modified by the presence of water and hydrogen...|$|R

The solar cells require high-capacity heat sinks to prevent <b>thermal</b> <b>destruction</b> and to manage temperature related electrical performance and life expectancy losses. To further exacerbate the concentrated cooling design, {{the heat sink}} must be passive, otherwise the power required for active cooling will reduce the overall conversion efficiency and economy. Multi-junction solar cells are currently favored over single junction cells, as they are more efficient and have a lower temperature coefficient (less loss in efficiency {{with an increase in}} temperature). The efficiency of both cell types rises with increased concentration; multi-junction efficiency rises faster. Multi-junction solar cells, originally designed for non-concentrating PV on space-based satellites, have been re-designed due to the high-current density encountered with CPV (typically 8 A/cm2 at 500 suns). Though the cost of multi-junction solar cells is roughly 100 times that of conventional silicon cells of the same area, the small cell area employed makes the relative costs of cells in each system comparable and the system economics favor the multi-junction cells. Multi-junction cell efficiency has now reached 44% in production cells.|$|E

A prime candidate technology for HLW treatment is <b>thermal</b> waste <b>destruction,</b> and vitrification for its disposal. The focus of this work was to study the thermal behavior, and develop an empirical model, of the thermal decomposition of an organic simulant HLW substance. Measurements were carried out using a laser driven thermal reactor (LDTR) at conditions representative of actual thermal treatment processes. The device provides reliable thermophysical and chemical kinetic data over a wide range of temperatures, heating rates, gas pressures, and environments. Unlike conventional thermal analysis techniques, which are designed to measure a selected thermal or chemical property in a nominally near-constant, equilibrium temperature environment, the LDTR measures an integrated thermal response. This integrated response represents the effects of multiple thermal and chemical properties in an environment characteristic of real-world reactors, where the temperatures are high, and rapidly changing. The LDTR was used as an off-line analytical device to characterize the thermal behavior of the organic high-level simulant waste PAS 94, under different thermal and physical conditions. The results showed a strong exothermic contribution of 2. 9 kJ/g between 720 K and 870 K, which was virtually undetected in measurements obtained with a conventional differential scanning calorimeter.

This subject addresses at least two key technical needs/problem areas recently identified by DOE/EM's Office of Science & Technology: emission-free destruction of organic wastes, and interactions between actinides and organic residues in materials stabilization. A sound basis for designing safe and effective treatment systems, and the ability to allay public concerns about radioactive fugitive emissions, will be the principal benefits of the project.
