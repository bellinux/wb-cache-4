25|$|Tax {{avoidance}} {{strategies and}} loopholes tend to emerge within income tax codes. They get created when taxpayers find legal methods {{to avoid paying}} taxes. Lawmakers then attempt to close the loopholes with additional legislation. That leads to a vicious cycle of ever more complex avoidance strategies and legislation. The vicious cycle tends to benefit large corporations and wealthy individuals that can afford the professional fees that come with ever more sophisticated <b>tax</b> <b>planning,</b> thus challenging the notion that even a marginal income tax system can be properly called progressive.|$|E
50|$|According to a September 2016 {{analysis}} by the conservative Tax Foundation, Trump's <b>tax</b> <b>plan</b> would reduce federal revenue by around $4.4 to $5.9 trillion over 10 years.

2500|$|Osborne {{announced}} on 16 May {{that he would}} deliver a second Budget on 8 July, and promised action on tax avoidance by the rich by bringing in a [...] "Google Tax" [...] designed to discourage large companies diverting profits out of the UK to avoid tax. In addition, large companies would now have to publish their UK tax strategies; any large businesses that persistently engaged in aggressive <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> {{would be subject to}} special measures. However, comments made by Osborne in 2003 on BBC2's Daily Politics programme then resurfaced; these regarded the avoidance of inheritance tax and using [...] "clever financial products" [...] to pass the value of homeowners' properties to their children, and were widely criticised by politicians and journalists as hypocritical.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of his career in business, Romney and his wife amassed a net worth in the {{hundreds}} of millions of dollars; their wealth remained in the range of a fifth to a quarter billion dollars as of 2011. [...] Most of it has been held in blind trusts since 2003. [...] An additional blind trust, valued at $100million in 2012, exists in the name of the Romneys' children. The trust, created in 1995, allows the Romneys to transfer money to heirs outside their estate, taking advantage of sophisticated <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> techniques used by high-net-worth families in an effort to defer or reduce their tax burden. Romney has an SEP-IRA worth between $21million and $102million. A portion of Romney's financial assets are held in offshore accounts and investments.|$|E

2500|$|In Canada, 17.4 {{percent of}} farms {{are owned by}} family {{corporations}} and 2.4 percent by non-family corporations. [...] In Canada (as in some other jurisdictions) conversion of a sole proprietorship family farm to a family corporation can have <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> benefits, and in some cases, the difference in combined provincial and federal taxation rates is substantial. [...] Also, for farm families with significant off-farm income, incorporating the farm can provide some shelter from high personal income tax rates. [...] Another important consideration can be some protection of the corporate shareholders from liability. [...] Incorporating a family farm can also be useful as a succession tool, [...] among other reasons because it can maintain a family farm as a viable operation where subdivision of the farm into smaller operations among heirs might result in farm sizes {{too small to be}} viable.|$|E
2500|$|Several Dynegy {{executives}} were later convicted or indicted for {{their roles in}} Dynegy's near-collapse. [...] In June 2003, Jamie Olis (former Senior Director of <b>Tax</b> <b>Planning),</b> Gene Foster (former Vice President for Taxation), and Helen Sharkey (a former employee in Dynegy's risk control and deal structure groups), were indicted on numerous counts of mail and wire fraud. According to court documents, the three employees conceived of a plan in early 2001 to borrow money but {{make it look like}} operational revenue. [...] A corporation known as ABG Gas Supply was created. [...] ABG secured loans from Citigroup, Credit Suisse First Boston, and Deutsche Bank to buy natural gas at market prices. ABG then sold this gas at a discount to Dynegy, which resold it at market prices and booked a $300 million profit. [...] ABG then bought natural gas at market prices, and sold it at a premium to Dynegy. [...] The profits ABG booked were then used to repay the loans. [...] Prosecutors accused Olis, Foster, and Sharkey of deceiving auditors, regulators, and other company executives regarding the transactions. Foster and Sharkey plead guilty two months later. Olis was found guilty in March 2004, and sentenced to 24 years in prison. (A year later, after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a different case held that mandatory sentencing guidelines violated the Constitution, Olis' sentence was reduced to just six years in prison.) In December 2003, three former executives at Nicor Energy LLC (a joint venture of Dynegy and Nicor), were indicted for illegally manipulating that firm's income by US$11 million in 2001 to hide losses. Former chief financial officer Robert Doty agreed to pay a $376,650 fine in October 2007 for his role in helping to conceal the ABG Gas Supply scheme.|$|E

50|$|In principle, {{the profit}} tax becomes {{a tax on}} the factors {{included}} into the formula, i.e., capital, sales and labour. This means that the tax bill increases {{in the country where}} one of the factors rises. Thus, <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> is still possible as companies have an incentive to shift the tax base to low-tax jurisdictions by means of transferring the formula factors, e.g., capital (i.e., assets) could be transferred from Germany to the Slovak Republic. However, <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> under separate accounting focuses on tax base shifting whereas <b>tax</b> <b>planning</b> under formula apportionment focuses on the location of investments.|$|E

50|$|Williams and Democratic Speaker of the House Jody Richards both criticized Governor Patton {{early in}} the {{legislative}} session for presenting his budget and <b>plan</b> for <b>tax</b> reform to the legislature as a single package, rather than separately, as had been customary for previous governors. Elements of the <b>tax</b> <b>plan</b> - in particular, a seven-cent-per-gallon hike in the gasoline tax - were considered unlikely to pass in isolation, and Williams and Richards believed Patton had bundled the budget and <b>tax</b> <b>plan</b> {{in order to make}} it harder for legislators to oppose these elements. Senate Republicans remained firmly against enacting any new taxes for most of the session, hampering the General Assembly's ability to pass a bundled budget. Williams was able to hold his caucus together against tax increases until the last few days of the session, when they acquiesced on enacting a six percent tax on out-of-state phone calls. Still, Republicans claimed victory for having defeated Patton's larger <b>tax</b> <b>plan.</b>|$|R
