The main purpose of Total Diet Studies (TDS) is to gain information on real dietary exposure to food contaminants. To produce reliable exposure estimations. analytical results need {{to be based on}} accurate procedures. One of the aims of the Total Diet Study Exposure Project (TDS-Exposure) is to develop a quality framework encompassing laboratory profile, adequate methods of analysis and establishment of realistic <b>target</b> <b>uncertainty</b> to guarantee fitness for purpose. Sample preparation and analysis are TDS steps where metrological principles are applied therefore, method performance and definition of <b>target</b> <b>uncertainty</b> by component and food are key features. In order to assess the <b>target</b> <b>uncertainty</b> to expect for each substance group A questionnaire was launched to TDS-Exposure partners to obtain information on laboratory quality profile which supports the decision on <b>target</b> <b>uncertainty</b> for each group of substances which have been prioritised in project: natural components; preservatives & colours; pesticides & veterinaries drugs residues; heavy metals, PCBs &dioxins; mycotoxins & akaloids; PAHs, furans & acrylamide; phthalates & bisphenol A. The results confirmed that modeling and experimental approaches are applied by analytical laboratories {{depending on the type of}} food and chemical substances. <b>Target</b> <b>uncertainty</b> established from limit of quantification is used to define the applicability of analytical methods.

40|$|Water is {{the most}} {{frequently}} and thoroughly characterised product due {{to the impact of}} the chemical composition of water of different sources or destinations on public health and on economy. The adequacy of water characterisation relies on measurement quality, which is a function of measurement traceability and uncertainty. In some analytical fields, target values of measurement performance parameters are set to ensure that the measurements quality is fit for the intended use. Nevertheless, frequently, these performance parameters do not allow the control of the magnitude of relevant components of measurement uncertainty. This work discusses the need for assessing fitness of the measurement for its intended use through the magnitude of uncertainty associated to the measurement value. The way this evaluation should be performed, when no guidelines are available, is also suggested. Target values of relevant performance parameters, results of interlaboratory tests, or the magnitude of trends of the measured quantity, are some types of information useful to define the maximum admissible uncertainty, i. e., <b>target</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> The information and algorithms used to define the <b>target</b> <b>uncertainty</b> are presented from the most suitable to the less likely to produce consensual values. Calculations are illustrated with application examples of different analytical fields. In this work, the way in which variability of uncertainty evaluation is taken into account when comparing estimated with <b>target</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo general {{questions}} were investigated using a visual search task. First, we asked whether effects of <b>target</b> <b>uncertainty</b> on reaction time varied with the discriminability {{of the target}} and distractors. Second, a higher order chromatic mechanism model was tested against a flexible model in which the signals in cardinal color-opponent mechanisms are combined through an attentional process. The models were tested by measuring the effects of <b>target</b> <b>uncertainty</b> on search time. A regression analysis indicated that {{the magnitude of the}} uncertainty effect was approximately constant in logarithmic units {{as a function of the}} chromatic difference between the target and distractors. The constant magnitude of the uncertainty effect suggested that an attentional capacity limit was exceeded when observers were required to monitor several chromatic mechanisms at several locations. The results of experiments 3 and 4 suggested that search for chromatic targets among distractors was mediated by diagonally tuned higher order chromatic mechanisms, rather than by signals in cardinal color-opponent mechanisms that were combined through an attentional mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{addresses}} optimal {{path planning}} and resource allocation for active multi-target localization. For each target, we solve a local Dynamic Program (DP) that plans optimal trajectories {{in the joint}} state-space of robot positions and <b>target</b> location <b>uncertainties,</b> captured by a cumulative error covariance matrix. The transitions {{in the space of}} robot positions are governed by the robot dynamics, while the transitions in the space of <b>target</b> <b>uncertainties</b> are regulated by a Kalman filter (KF) that fuses new information about the target locations with the current beliefs. The fused <b>target</b> <b>uncertainties</b> enter the objective function of the local DP using the trace of the associated covariance matrix. Using the optimal sensing policies local to each target, we construct a global DP to determine how far along the single target optimal trajectories the sensor should travel before transitioning to the next target. The integrated system jointly optimizes the collective <b>target</b> localization <b>uncertainty</b> and the total distance traveled by the sensing agent. The proposed control scheme is more computationally efficient than methods that use only the sensor configuration to compute future uncertainty and more exact than methods that abstract away the filtered sensing uncertainty.

Energy Payback Time is a typical energetic parameter {{used to compare the}} performances of systems under specific scenarios. To discriminate between scenarios the difference of parameter values is considered. The significance of the difference makes the confidence on the result and the reliability of a comparison, it depends on the difference and its uncertainty. Objective: This paper shows and discusses how to evaluate the uncertainty of the difference of parameters, defines a <b>target</b> <b>uncertainty</b> to achieve reliable discrimination. A case study on photovoltaic scenarios is used to apply methodology, commercial modules monocrystalline Si, amorphous Si and polycrystalline Si were considered for comparison. Results: Scenarios were compared by their energy payback time. All uncertainty sources were quantified and discussed and energy payback time uncertainty was calculated. Confidence of comparisons was lower than 95 % and a <b>target</b> <b>uncertainty</b> was calculated. Conclusion: The use of uncertainty approach gives a much more detailed information on comparison.

Rather, target segmentation involves an attentional mechanism that modifies the processing system by allocating a limited `selection weight' to the various dimensions that potentially define the target...|$|E

The diagonal effect occurred not with prosaccades but with antisaccades and memory-guided saccades with long intervals, consistent with hypotheses that it originates in computations of goal location under conditions of uncertainty.

Computable error estimates offer the possibility of quantifying accuracy on a given mesh and predicting a fine grid functional on a coarser mesh.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Target {{tracking}} is {{a hybrid}} estimation problem involving both continuous and discrete uncertainties [31]. In the prevailing approaches to target tracking, the modeling {{of the target}} motion/dynamics and the sensory system is essential. In these systemoriented approaches, it is customary to use the continuous-valued process/plant noise and measurement noise to cover the unknown modeling errors or deviations of the model from the true system. However, the major challenges of target tracking arise from two discrete-valued uncertainties: the measurement origin <b>uncertainty</b> and the <b>target</b> motion <b>uncertainty.</b> The measurement origin uncertainty refers {{to the fact that}} a measurement provided by the sensory system for target tracking may have originated from an extraneous source, including clutter, false alarms, and neighboring targets, as well as the target under track. It may also have originated from countermeasures from the <b>target.</b> This <b>uncertainty</b> is clearly discrete in natu...|$|R
40|$|Mounting neural {{evidence}} suggests that, in situations {{in which there}} are multiple potential targets for action, the brain prepares, in parallel, competing movements associated with these targets, prior to implementing one of them. Central to this interpretation is the idea that competing viewed targets, prior to selection, are rapidly and automatically transformed into corresponding motor representations. Here, by applying target-specific, gradual visuomotor rotations and dissociating, unbeknownst to participants, the visual direction of potential targets {{from the direction of the}} movements required to reach the same targets, we provide direct evidence for this provocative idea. Our results offer strong empirical support for theories suggesting that competing action options are automatically represented in terms of the movements required to attain them. The rapid motor encoding of potential targets may support the fast optimization of motor costs under conditions of <b>target</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and allow the motor system to inform decisions about target selection...|$|E

The global team behavior serves to optimize the team’s knowledge because each robot considers the observational contributions of teammates. The utility of an observation is evaluated as the reduction of <b>target</b> <b>uncertainty</b> resulting from it. The approach is evaluated in simulation with static and moving targets.
