5|$|Alexander {{controversially}} {{married the}} commoner Aspasia Manos in 1919, provoking a major scandal <b>that</b> <b>forced</b> {{the couple to}} leave Greece for several months. Soon after returning to Greece with his wife, Alexander was bitten by a domestic Barbary macaque and died of sepsis. The sudden death of the sovereign led to questions over the monarchy's survival {{and contributed to the}} fall of the Venizelist regime. After a general election and a referendum, Constantine I was restored to the throne.|$|E
5|$|At the 2012 London Paralympics, Gallagher {{competed in}} the Women's Long Jump F13 and Women's Javelin Throw F12/13 events, {{finishing}} fifth and sixth respectively.

5|$|Beginning {{the tour}} with a duck, Kippax {{recovered}} with 89 at Leicester before contracting a {{heavy dose of}} influenza <b>that</b> <b>forced</b> him to miss the next four matches. On his return, he struggled for form, and was not chosen for the first Test. Kippax was the third selector on tour, and was out-voted by his fellow selectors, so the press speculated that the decision caused disharmony within the team. Australia won the game and Kippax failed in the next two tour matches, so he missed out on the next Test at Lord's, which was lost.|$|E

Virginia Tech received the opening kickoff, but failed to capitalize on its opening drive thanks to a personal foul penalty <b>that</b> <b>forced</b> the Hokies to punt. On its first possession, Georgia moved into scoring position courtesy of a 26-yard run by Kregg Lumpkin. Failing to advance the ball further, Georgia sent in kicker Brandon Coutu who kicked a 39-yard field goal to give Georgia the early lead, 3–0.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} preseason co-favorite in the league, Texas A {{finished}} 14-18 overall and 4-14 in the Big 12. The team was hampered by {{a rash of}} injuries, including a knee injury <b>that</b> <b>forced</b> Middleton to sit for 12 games. He averaged 13.2 points and 5.0 rebounds per game, down from the previous season. On April 9, 2012, Middleton declared for the NBA Draft, forgoing his final season of collegiate eligibility.

5|$|He {{was named}} to the second all-star team and was named a finalist for the Norris Trophy as the league's top defenceman. His coach, Terry Murray, praised Doughty for his {{improvement}} during the season. Doughty helped lead the Kings into the playoffs {{for the first time since}} 2002, though they lost their first round series to the Vancouver Canucks. He played all six games of the series despite suffering a wrist injury in the first game <b>that</b> <b>forced</b> him to decline an invitation to play for Canada at the 2010 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships.|$|E

The floodwaters closed portions of Interstate 35, U.S. Route 84, and Texas State Highway 36. The system also spawned a tornado in Sugar Land that damaged four buildings, including a school.|$|E

5|$|Red Bull Racing {{suffered}} a double retirement, with Vettel falling victim to another alternator failure and Mark Webber spinning violently at the Ascari chicane, with the resultant {{damage to his}} tyres sending vibrations through the car <b>that</b> <b>forced</b> him to retire. This allowed Hamilton to leapfrog both drivers and Kimi Räikkönen – who finished the race fifth – to take {{second place in the}} World Drivers' Championship, with the result enabling McLaren to close the gap to Red Bull in the World Constructors' Championship.|$|E
5|$|The Burmese forces {{chose to}} retreat via the Mae Lamao pass (in modern-day Mae Sot, Tak).

5|$|The Kings {{opened the}} season in London, England for the first regular season games played in Europe in league history. Cammalleri scored two goals, {{including}} the first ever in Europe, in a 4–1 victory over the Anaheim Ducks on September 29, 2007. He {{opened the season}} with ten goals in ten games before a protracted offensive slump and rib injury <b>that</b> <b>forced</b> him out of lineup for a month resulted in only nine more goals scored over {{the remainder of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|The temperance {{movement}} {{remained a}} strong influence though, and when new breweries were set up, the outcry led to the Welsh Sunday Closing Act in 1881, an act <b>that</b> <b>forced</b> the closure of public houses in Wales on a Sunday. Wales' passion for beer remained; the Wrexham Lager Beer Company opened in 1881, as the first lager producer in Britain. The Felinfoel Brewery {{made a deal with}} the local tin works and became the first brewery in Europe to put beer in cans.|$|E
5|$|The trade {{provided}} immediate dividends for the Flames, as Kiprusoff recorded 22 saves in a 2–1 {{victory over}} the Montreal Canadiens {{in his first game}} with Calgary on November 20. He won 12 of 17 starts between November 20 and December 29, giving up one goal or fewer 11 times in that stretch. He was named the defensive player of the month for December by the League, but suffered a sprained medial collateral ligament (MCL) in his knee {{at the end of the}} month <b>that</b> <b>forced</b> him out of the lineup for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} {{service in}} the early 1930s, the {{four members of the}} Zara class took part in training exercises with the Italian fleet and participated in fleet reviews held for foreign leaders, including Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany and Miklós Horthy, the Regent of Hungary. Gorizia and Pola were involved in the Spanish Civil War; in 1936 Pola conducted non-intervention patrols and Gorizia carried Italian nationals from Gijon, Spain, to Le Verdon-sur-Mer, France that year. After departing France, Gorizia visited Germany, and on the way back, she suffered a major explosion in an aviation gasoline tank <b>that</b> <b>forced</b> her to put into Gibraltar for repairs. There, British shipyard inspectors discovered that the ship was grossly over the Washington Treaty's displacement restriction. In March 1939, all four ships sortied to prevent a squadron of Republican warships from reaching the Black Sea, forcing them to stop in Bizerte, Tunisia, where they were interned. The following month, Zara, Pola, and Gorizia provided gunfire support to Italian forces invading Albania.|$|E
