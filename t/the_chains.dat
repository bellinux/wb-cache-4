5|$|Another set of officials, {{the chain}} crew, are {{responsible}} for moving <b>the</b> <b>chains.</b> <b>The</b> <b>chains,</b> consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. The chain crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring <b>the</b> <b>chains</b> on to the field to measure. A typical chain crew will have at least three people – {{two members of the}} chain crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down, and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very strong}} {{evidence}} that comets have previously been fragmented and collided with Jupiter and its satellites. During the Voyager missions to the planet, planetary scientists identified 13 crater chains on Callisto and three on Ganymede, the origin of which was initially a mystery. Crater chains seen on the Moon often radiate from large craters, and {{are thought to be}} caused by secondary impacts of the original ejecta, but <b>the</b> <b>chains</b> on the Jovian moons did not lead back to a larger crater. The impact of SL9 strongly implied that <b>the</b> <b>chains</b> were due to trains of disrupted cometary fragments crashing into the satellites.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>chain</b> catcher {{helps prevent}} <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> being thrown {{back towards the}} user, if <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> breaks or becomes derailed. The catcher catches <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> when it details {{downwards}} and shortens it. Then <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> moves underneath <b>the</b> saw body smashing against the rear hand protection at the rear handle (The bottom of the handle is wider to the ba side as to the other). As shown in <b>the</b> image <b>chain</b> catchers are made of aluminum not to damage <b>the</b> <b>chain.</b> A worn out chain catcher can be changed.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>chain</b> boat {{navigation}} <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> {{was simply}} laid [...] "loose" [...] on the riverbed for long distances {{of up to}} several hundred kilometres. Only the deadweight of <b>the</b> massive <b>chain,</b> which weighed about [...] or , and its natural snagging on the sand and stones of the riverbed provided resistance, so that <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> boat and its attached barges could haul themselves along <b>the</b> <b>chain.</b> <b>The</b> water bore {{the weight of the}} boats and barges, whilst <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> only had to cope with the power of <b>the</b> engine. <b>The</b> <b>chain</b> was only anchored at its two ends so that boats could continue to haul themselves to the end of <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> route.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>chain</b> stays run {{parallel}} to <b>the</b> <b>chain,</b> connecting <b>the</b> {{bottom bracket shell}} to the rear fork ends or dropouts. When the rear derailleur cable is routed partially along the down tube, it is also routed along <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> stay. Occasionally (principally on frames made since the late 1990s) mountings for disc brakes will be attached to <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> stays. There may be a small brace that connects <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> stays {{in front of the}} rear wheel and behind the bottom bracket shell.|$|R
5|$|Adam, a photographer, awakens in {{a bathtub}} {{in a large}} {{dilapidated}} bathroom, and finds himself chained at the ankle to a pipe. Lawrence Gordon, an oncologist, is similarly shackled across the room, and between them is a corpse holding a revolver and a microcassette recorder. Each man has a tape in his pocket, and Adam is able to retrieve the recorder. Adam's tape urges him to escape the bathroom, while Lawrence's tape tells him to kill Adam by six o'clock, or {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed and he will be left to die. Adam finds a bag containing two hacksaws inside a toilet tank; they attempt to cut through <b>the</b> <b>chains,</b> but Adam's saw breaks and he throws it at the mirror in frustration, revealing a hidden camera behind the mirror. Lawrence realizes that the hacksaws weren't meant for <b>the</b> <b>chains,</b> but for their feet and identifies their captor as the Jigsaw Killer, whom Lawrence knows of because he was a suspect five months before.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy XI is {{represented}} in the Dissidia game series by Shantotto, a female Tarutaru Black Mage from the Windurst storyline, voiced by famed voice actress Megumi Hayashibara in the Japanese version and Candi Milo in English version.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, bands {{from across the}} United States began to move towards {{what would become the}} glam metal sound. In 1981, Mötley Crüe (from Los Angeles) {{released}} their first album Too Fast for Love, Dokken (also from Los Angeles) released their first Breaking <b>the</b> <b>Chains,</b> and Kix (from western Maryland) released their first album, Kix. In 1982, Night Ranger (from San Francisco) released their initial album Dawn Patrol which reached the top 40 in the United States.|$|E

50|$|This game's {{score and}} hyper {{mechanics}} are highly {{similar to those}} of DaiOuJou. The biggest basic difference in scoring is that <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> hit counter will not reset immediately when <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> meter empties; <b>the</b> counter will instead drop by 25% and decrease very quickly until <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> continues. <b>The</b> <b>chain</b> meter is also more easily kept above zero by using the laser.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>chain</b> {{is removed}} from the {{chainring}} and rests around the bottom bracket shell and on the sprocket with the rear wheel in the horizontal track ends. <b>The</b> <b>chain</b> is folded over itself such that the bottom half of <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> is trapped between the sprocket and the upper half. The sprocket is then prevented from turning because <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> is wrapped around the bottom bracket. It is essential to take steps to protect the paintwork on the bottom bracket shell from damage by <b>the</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|R
5|$|Oxyhalides and oxysulfides of {{protactinium}} are known. PaOBr3 has a monoclinic structure {{composed of}} double-chain units where protactinium has coordination 7 and is arranged into pentagonal bipyramids. <b>The</b> <b>chains</b> are interconnected through oxygen and bromine atoms, and each oxygen atom is related to three protactinium atoms. PaOS is a light-yellow non-volatile solid with a cubic crystal lattice isostructural {{to that of other}} actinide oxysulfides. It is obtained by reacting protactinium(V) chloride with a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide at 900°C.|$|E
5|$|The Ancient Minister's true {{identity}} {{is found to}} be that of the Master R.O.B. unit, who rebels against Ganondorf to join the allied characters. The three major groups that had formed over the storyline then all converge in one area, and use the Halberd to battle Ganondorf and Bowser's subspace gunship. Although they destroy the Halberd, all of the characters make it out unscathed in smaller vehicles. Unable to hit so many targets, Ganondorf and Bowser retreat into subspace after Kirby destroys the gunship with his dragoon. An enraged Ganondorf turns Bowser into a trophy with his dark cannon, and he learns that Master Hand was being manipulated by <b>the</b> <b>chains</b> of the actual Subspace Army leader, known only as Tabuu. Ganondorf jumps up and does the attack on Tabuu who easily defeats him, Ganondorf collides with Master Hand, thus breaking free from <b>the</b> <b>chains</b> and turning Ganondorf into his trophy. Master Hand attempts to attack Tabuu, but to no avail.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} once {{contained}} the linked chains of Navarre; however, following a legal suit by the Navarre government {{claiming that the}} usage of {{the arms of a}} region on the flag of another was illegal, the Constitutional Court of Spain forced the Basque government to remove <b>the</b> <b>chains</b> of Navarre, leaving the red background.|$|E
50|$|Manjula is a motherless {{girl who}} desires {{to get a}} gold chain for her birthday. A women gives a gold chain to Rajan, asking him to {{safeguard}} <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> from her husband while she is out of town. Forced by circumstances to fulfill his word, Rajan presents <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> to his daughter. Manjula accidentally loses <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> while she is bathing in the town lake. Meanwhile, another person gives rs.1000 to A.V.M. Arul to safeguard <b>the</b> <b>chain.</b> He decides to use this to compensate for <b>the</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|R

50|$|This effect {{became even}} more {{pronounced}} if <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> became twisted, e.g., <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> was pulled to one side or had even formed knots. This increased the turn radius by up to 25%, whereby the 5% elastic limit of <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> was reached.|$|R
5|$|About 10,000years ago {{the humans}} who {{inhabited}} the lands around the Mediterranean basin began to domesticate wild animals. Pigs, cattle, goats, sheep, horses, camels, {{cats and dogs}} were all kept and bred in captivity. These animals would have brought their viruses with them. The transmission of viruses from animals to humans can occur, but such zoonotic infections are rare and subsequent human-to-human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer, although there are notable exceptions such as influenza. Most viruses are species-specific and would have posed no threat to humans. The rare epidemics of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short-lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations were too small to maintain <b>the</b> <b>chains</b> of infection.|$|E
5|$|According to the legend, the raskovnik could unlock any gate or padlock, {{regardless}} of its size, material or key. It could also uncover treasures buried in the ground: in Bulgarian beliefs, it could split {{the ground at the}} place where a treasure lay so that people could locate it. In some regions of Serbia, the treasure itself was a black man in chains who requested that a raskovnik be brought to him. The raskovnik would break <b>the</b> <b>chains</b> and the man would disappear into the ground {{to be replaced by a}} cauldron filled with gold coins. Other supernatural properties attributed to the herb by Bulgarians include the alchemic ability to transmute iron into gold, the more general ability to make the one who picked it forever happy or wealthy. In some interpretations, the raskovnik is a wonderful plant that makes true whatever its owner desires.|$|E
5|$|Beyoncé dances seductively {{towards the}} men as scenes of Beyoncé wearing several outfits are seen, {{the first of}} which is a white evening gown as she grasps <b>the</b> <b>chains</b> of two chained hyenas. As the {{confrontation}} escalates, Beyoncé appears next to several flaming vehicles, and she undergoes another costume change. Returning to the main plot, the video shows Beyoncé in front {{of a small group of}} her female army, wearing a yellow ensemble and black heeled-boots. As the dancing commences, scenes of the two clashing armies are seen while Beyoncé writhes in sand. The females, now an even larger group, are shown dancing, using powerful and emphatic movements, in front of the male army with alternating costumes and several flags in the background. The video ends with the front line of females confronting the men face to face, raising their right arms and saluting to them as Beyoncé rips off the male general's badge, placing it on herself.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>chain</b> pump is {{type of a}} {{water pump}} in which several {{circular}} discs are positioned on an endless chain. One part of <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> dips into <b>the</b> water, and <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> runs through a tube, slightly bigger than {{the diameter of the}} discs. As <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> is drawn up the tube, water becomes trapped between the discs and is lifted to and discharged at <b>the</b> top. <b>Chain</b> pumps were used for centuries in the ancient Middle East, Europe, China, and ancient Egypt.|$|R

It is used to stop <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> when it derails from the bar and shortens the length of <b>the</b> <b>chain.</b> When derailing <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> swings from {{underneath}} the saw towards the operator. The shorting prevents hitting the operator, but it hits the rear handle guard.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, the Wilis have cornered {{a terrified}} Hilarion. They use their magic {{to force him}} to dance until he is nearly dead, and then drown him in a nearby lake. Then they turn on Albrecht, {{sentencing}} him to death as well. He pleads to Myrtha for his life, but she coldly refuses. Giselle's pleas are also dismissed and Albrecht is forced to dance until sunrise. However, the power of Giselle's love counters the Wilis' magic and spares his life. The other spirits return to their graves at daybreak, but Giselle has broken through <b>the</b> <b>chains</b> of hatred and vengeance that control the Wilis, and is thus released from their powers. After bidding a tender farewell to Albrecht, Giselle returns to her grave to rest in peace.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Ludwig {{venture into}} the {{volcanic}} caves to find Trepkos. When they find Firewalker, Trepkos shoots Ludwig {{in the back with}} a flare gun, killing him. He then burns Ludwig's body, as he was infected with the spore as well. Trepkos tells Mulder that after Firewalker returned from its first descent, Erickson pulverized a rock in one of its samples, resulting in his death and the infection of all the scientists immediately surrounding him. Trepkos says that the spore is parasitic in nature, making its hosts pass itself on to others. Meanwhile, in the lab, an infected O'Neil handcuffs herself to Scully to expose her to the spore, forcing Scully to use a hammer to split <b>the</b> <b>chains</b> but to no avail, so she instead protects herself by throwing O'Neil into a sealed chamber and closing the door. A protrusion then bursts out of O'Neil's throat, killing her without spreading the spore to Scully.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, Sony {{canceled}} the New York City premiere. Later that day, other major theater chains including AMC, Cinemark, Cineplex, Regal and Southern Theatres either delayed or canceled screenings of the film. <b>The</b> <b>chains</b> reportedly came {{under pressure from}} the malls where many theaters are located, which feared that the terror threat would harm their holiday sales. They also feared expensive lawsuits {{in the event of an}} attack; Cinemark, for instance, contended that it could not have foreseen the 2012 Aurora shooting, which took place at one of its multiplexes, a defense that would not hold in the event of an attack at a screening of The Interview.|$|E
50|$|It {{was founded}} by Eugene Applebaum and Bruno Manni when merging five stores and {{incorporating}} <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> under <b>the</b> Arbor name.

5|$|On October 5, 2011, Universal Pictures {{announced}} that Tower Heist {{would be made}} available for home viewing via parent company Comcast's video on demand system three weeks after its theatrical debut at the rental cost of $59.99. The move was announced as a test case, to be conducted only in Atlanta and Portland. The move met with criticism from cinema chains over concern that the test and any further future implementation would impact ticket sales. The following day, Cinemark Theatres the third largest cinema chain in the United States threatened to not show the film at all if Universal proceeded with the test. On October 11, 2011, several independent theater chains, including Galaxy Theatres, Regency Theatres and Emagine Theatres, and small cinema houses representing approximately 50 screens across the country, also threatened not to play Tower Heist. The following day <b>the</b> <b>chains</b> were joined by 950-screen National Amusements theater chain. In response, Universal Pictures released {{a statement saying that}} they would no longer pursue the proposed test.|$|E
5|$|Smuggling {{was one of}} Christchurch's {{most lucrative}} {{industries}} during the 18th and 19th centuries due to easy access to neighbouring towns and the difficult harbour entrance which acted {{as a barrier to}} customs cutters. Many townspeople were involved in this illegal trade and large quantities of wealth were accumulated. In 1784 a confrontation between a gang of local smugglers and Customs and Excise officers led to the Battle of Mudeford in which a Royal Navy officer was killed and a smuggler subsequently executed. Another important industry during this period was the manufacture of fusee chains for watches and clocks. In 1790, Robert Cox began to manufacture fusee chains in workshops in the High Street. By 1793 Cox gained a monopoly on chain production in Britain, supplying watch, clock and chronometer makers throughout the country. In 1845 William Hart opened a similar factory in Bargates. However, by 1875 <b>the</b> <b>chains</b> were no longer required due to changes in watch designs and the factories were closed.|$|E
5|$|The Land Estates Act of 1908 {{was passed}} by the Madras Government in order to protect {{cultivators}} in Zamindaris from exploitation. Under the act, ryots were made permanent occupants of the land. However, far from protecting the ryots, the legislation proved to be detrimental to the interests of the cultivators in the Oriya-speaking northern districts of the presidency who were the intended beneficiaries, as it tied the cultivator to his land and landlord with <b>the</b> <b>chains</b> of eternal serfdom. In 1933, an amendment to the Act was introduced by the Raja of Bobbili to curb the rights of Zamindars and safeguard the cultivators from exploitation. This act was passed in the legislative council despite strong opposition from the Zamindars.|$|E
