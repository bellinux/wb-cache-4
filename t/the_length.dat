40|$|This study {{examined}} the morphometric and meristic characters of African Bony Tongue (Heterotis niloticus) {{in order to identify}} possible phenotypic sex markers in this potential aquaculture species. The ratios of external measurements of <b>the</b> dorsal <b>length,</b> <b>the</b> pre-dorsal <b>length,</b> <b>the</b> head <b>length,</b> <b>the</b> peduncle <b>length,</b> <b>the</b> anal <b>length,</b> <b>the</b> pectoral <b>length,</b> <b>the</b> pelvic <b>length</b> and <b>the</b> caudal <b>length</b> to <b>the</b> standard <b>length</b> was determined. <b>The</b> inter-orbital <b>length</b> of head <b>length</b> and <b>the</b> snout <b>length</b> of head length were also analyzed. The analyses were done in thirty (30) specimens of Heterotis niloticus. Only two of the morphological ratios namely peduncle <b>length</b> of <b>the</b> standard <b>length</b> and <b>the</b> inter-orbital <b>length</b> of <b>the</b> head <b>length</b> indicated significantly higher values (P< 0. 05) in the females. The ratio of peduncle <b>length</b> to <b>the</b> standard <b>length</b> in <b>the</b> female was 5. 13 ± 0. 56 and 4. 89 ± 0. 43 was re-corded in the male, while the ratio of inter-orbital length to head <b>length</b> in <b>the</b> female was 39. 35 ± 2. 16 and 37. 54 ± 2. 05 was recorded in the male. Sensory pits count on both {{the right and the left}} opercula plates were higher in the male than the female though, the difference was not significant enough for sensory pits count to form the basis for sexual dimorphism. The dimorphism so indicated in peduncle length and inter-orbital length is not readily observable by visual examination and may require simple measurements, which may not be easily carried out for routine sex determination on the field. However, it can be used to separate the broodstock population into different male and female holding facilities, while exteriorization of sexual products by catheterization or hand stripping can be used to confirm the sex of the selected broodstock and their readiness to spawn during the breeding season.
