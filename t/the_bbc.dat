5|$|In 1927, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, {{under its}} {{conductor}} Wilhelm Furtwängler, gave two concerts at the Queen's Hall. These, and later concerts {{by the same}} orchestra in 1928 and 1929, made obvious the comparatively poor standards of London orchestras. Both <b>the</b> <b>BBC</b> and Sir Thomas Beecham had ambitions to bring London's orchestral standards up to those of Berlin. After an early attempt at co-operation between <b>the</b> <b>BBC</b> and Beecham, they went their separate ways; <b>the</b> <b>BBC</b> established <b>the</b> <b>BBC</b> Symphony Orchestra under Adrian Boult, and Beecham, together with Malcolm Sargent, founded the London Philharmonic Orchestra.|$|E

50|$|From 1945 to 1963 Gillard {{worked in}} <b>the</b> <b>BBC's</b> western region, {{becoming}} its director in 1955. In 1964 {{he was made}} Director of Radio with a seat on <b>the</b> <b>BBC's</b> Board of Management. He saw the need {{to fill the gap}} left by the demise of pirate radio for 'pop' music. To do this he reorganised <b>the</b> <b>BBC's</b> radio into four stations, Radios 1, 2, 3 & 4. He also discontinued Children's Hour and shut <b>the</b> <b>BBC's</b> Features Department.

5|$|Among those {{determined}} that London {{should have a}} permanent orchestra of similar excellence were Sir John Reith, director-general of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham. In 1928 they opened discussions about jointly setting up such an ensemble, but after 18 months of negotiations {{it became clear that}} the corporation and the conductor had irreconcilable priorities. Beecham demanded more personal control of the orchestra and repertoire than <b>the</b> <b>BBC</b> was willing to concede, and his priorities were the opera house and the concert hall rather than the broadcasting studio. <b>The</b> <b>BBC</b> went ahead without him, and under its director of music, Adrian Boult, launched <b>the</b> <b>BBC</b> Symphony Orchestra in October 1930, to immense acclaim.|$|E
