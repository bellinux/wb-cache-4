You {{have to learn to}} conserve your energy. In college, you just left it all out on the field every game. In pro ball, you do that and you'll wear out, because you play every single day.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the tree's cutting, Criss shaved Meek's {{face with}} his axe. He lathered Meek's face and neck and moved his axe blade over Meek's bristles, drawing blood at his chin line. Criss commented: [...] "That's the trouble with {{having a lot of}} {{officials}} around. I've shaved a thousand men with that axe and that's the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> drew blood.

500|$|Gielgud {{was in the}} Oxford {{company in}} January and February 1924, from October 1924 {{to the end of}} January 1925, and in August 1925. He played a wide range of parts in {{classics}} and modern plays, greatly increasing his technical abilities in the process. The role he most enjoyed was Trofimov in The Cherry Orchard, his first experience of Chekhov: [...] "It was the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> went out on stage feeling that perhaps, after all, I could really be an actor." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{was sold}} on to Scunthorpe United for £40,000 in March 1986, signing a {{contract}} of £250 {{a week and}} receiving a car and an ex gratia payment of £10,000. Houchen later said that [...] "it was the only <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> gave up... it wasn't the right club because it wasn't going anywhere... I said to Yvonne, 'I'm {{just going to take}} the money'". In doing so he rejected moves to Preston North End and Third Division Bury. He quickly regretted the move, and despite getting along well with manager Frank Barlow he found himself hating everything at the club, from the supporters to the Old Showground itself.|$|E

500|$|Bob Monkhouse as Space Navigator Brad Newman. Monkhouse, {{an actor}} in such films as Carry On Sergeant (1958), would later host the British game show The Golden Shot between 1967 and 1972. He first {{approached}} Gerry Anderson for permission to film a comedy sketch based on Stingray, but ended up agreeing to replace Alfred Marks, who had withdrawn from the film due to a fee dispute, as Newman. Monkhouse recalled the conversation: [...] " [...] said, 'How much would you charge for the job?' I said, 'Gerry, I'd do it for nothing.' And {{that was the first}} <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> heard the phrase, 'The price is right'." [...] He affected an American accent for his parts in the film.|$|E
500|$|Killebrew {{was known}} for his quick hands and {{exceptional}} upper-body strength, demonstrated by several [...] "tape measure" [...] home runs that he hit in the prime of his career. Killebrew said that his first home run in the Majors was his favorite, coming off Billy Hoeft at Griffith Stadium. He said of it, [...] "Frank House was the catcher. When I came to the plate, he said, 'Kid, we're going to throw you a fastball.' I didn't know whether to believe him or not. I hit it out. It was one of the longest home runs I ever hit. As I crossed the plate, House said, 'That's the last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> tell you what pitch is coming'." ...|$|E
500|$|Brown had a {{difficult}} childhood; after her divorce, his working mother received welfare benefits. Brown experienced sexual abuse from a camp counselor who threatened to kill the 10-year-old boy if he told anyone– {{which he did not}} disclose, even to his family, until his autobiography Against All Odds (2011)– and physical abuse from his stepfathers. During various periods of his childhood, Brown lived with his grandparents and his aunt. He shoplifted many times, and was arrested for stealing record albums and brought before Judge Samuel Zoll in Salem, Massachusetts at the age of 12. Zoll asked Brown if his siblings would like seeing him play basketball in jail and required Brown to write a 1,500-word essay on that question as his punishment. Brown later said, [...] "that was the last <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> stole." ...|$|E

500|$|Coveleski {{signed his}} first {{professional}} contract in 1909 with the minor league Lancaster Red Roses, a club {{affiliated with the}} Tri-State League. Originally reluctant to sign for the club, he only agreed to do so if his older brother John also joined; at that time he anglicized his name, changing it to Coveleskie, which it would remain throughout his professional career. During {{his first trip to}} Lancaster, he recalled that it was [...] "the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> rode on a train", and he added that he [...] "was too shy to eat in the hotel {{with the rest of the}} team". In 272 innings of work his first season, Coveleski had a 23–11 win-loss record with an earned run average of 1.95. He pitched two more seasons for Lancaster, earning a record of 53–38 in 109 appearances through three seasons.|$|E
500|$|After {{his brother}} died in 1929, Pond married Katherine N. de Nancrede, who was 47 years old, at a {{ceremony}} in Ann Arbor. [...] Pond said at the time, [...] "It's the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> did it, and I thought I ought to be pardoned because of my youth." [...] Pond was also an amateur acrobat and remained a physical fitness buff all of his life. [...] At {{the time of his}} wedding in 1929, the Associated Press reported that he is [...] "almost as well known for his present athletic agility as for his architectural accomplishments. A part of his daily routine is to turn handsprings and flipflops and do other strenuous exercises." [...] He drew applause when, on his 80th birthday, he grabbed his bare knees with both hands and performed a backflip. [...] A photograph of Pond's feat was published in Life magazine in June 1937.|$|E
500|$|At the time, it was {{unheard of}} for a debuting artist {{to receive the}} coveted rating. Author Matthew Gasteier writes, “It's {{difficult}} to overestimate the impact of receiving the five out of five mics, the first such rating given to any new release by the magazine since its then-editor Reginald Dennis put a moratorium on them." [...] Reginald Dennis, former music editor of the magazine and XXL co-founder, later recounted, [...] "Awarding records 5 mics – classic status – has always been, on some levels, troubling to me. I mean, we are not only saying that a particular piece of music is superior to everything that is out now, {{but it will be}} better than most things released in the future as well [...] I only gave one 5 under my watch and it went to Nas's Illmatic." [...] Dennis cited it as [...] "the only <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> broke the 'no 5' rule" [...] and added, [...] "I told Jon that we'd work all of that stuff out {{when it was time to}} review the album. But everyday, Jon was like, 'yo, this album is 5 mics — seriously, Reg, 5 mics!' ...|$|E

500|$|In September, {{the album}} entered Billboards album charts; the highest {{position}} Freewheelin reached was number 22, but it eventually came to sell one {{million copies in}} the US. Dylan himself came to acknowledge Freewheelin as the album that marked {{the start of his}} success. During his dispute with Albert Grossman, Dylan stated in a deposition: [...] "Although I didn't know it at the time, the second album was destined to become a great success because it was to include 'Blowin' in the Wind'." [...] Besides [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", [...] "Masters of War", [...] "Girl from the North Country", [...] "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" [...] and [...] "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" [...] have all been acclaimed as masterpieces, and they have been mainstays of Dylan's performing repertory to the present day. The album's balance between serious subject matter and levity, earnest finger-pointing songs and surreal jokes captured a wide audience, including The Beatles, who were on the cusp of global success. John Lennon recalled: [...] "In Paris in 1964 was the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> heard Dylan at all. Paul got the record (The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan) from a French DJ. For three weeks in Paris we didn't stop playing it. We all went potty about Dylan." ...|$|E
500|$|In a 2010 {{interview}} with Iwata, {{he was surprised}} about the game's reception outside Japan, which retrogamers have named {{it as one of}} their favorite and most memorable 8-bit titles. He said: [...] "It’s kind of funny that the first <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> really had any sense of the game’s success was about 10 years following the original release of Blaster Master, when a young staff member from the U.S. office said something to me like, 'You’d definitely have become a super famous game designer if you were an American.'" [...] Alex Neuse, creator of the Bit.Trip series, reminisced his memories of playing Blaster Master as a child. He acknowledged that the game was a clone of Metroid that featured a tank that could jump and a corny storyline, but he said it was all [...] "presented {{in a way that it}} felt meaningful". He added that the game's music convinced him [...] "that video game music could be high-quality, memorable, and evocative". 1UP.com listed the game as the 11th best NES game of all time in its [...] "Top 25 NES Games" [...] list; the 1UP.com staff said the game was [...] "an action game that worked like a mishmash of every NES game before it", noting the expansive map like in Metroid. Paste magazine ranked Blaster Master as the 2nd greatest NES game of all time, behind The Legend of Zelda; they cited the tank's additional abilities as a main reason behind its ranking.|$|E
500|$|... "Wedding Bell Blues" [...] was {{described}} by Bobby Hankinson of The Houston Chronicle as [...] "the perfect combination of a great song, plot relevance, and Princess Beatrice hat". Stanhope agreed with him on all three points, and added that it was [...] "a great pick for her vocals". Slezak described those vocals as [...] "a breath of dewy spring air" [...] and gave the song an [...] "A", but Lynch thought Emma was not [...] "much of a singer" [...] and gave the number a [...] "B−", though he said [...] "the curiosity of backup vocals from Coach Beiste and Sue Sylvester made this entirely worthwhile". Poniewozik characterized the staging of the song as [...] "phoned in". [...] "The First <b>Time</b> <b>I</b> <b>Ever</b> Saw Your Face" [...] was given an [...] "A" [...] by Lynch and an [...] "A−" [...] by Slezak; the latter called the vocals [...] "pretty electrifying". Flandez said the song was [...] "sublime" [...] and complimented the lighting, the mood, and the direction by Eric Stoltz, and VanDerWerff described it as the episode's [...] "best single number". While Futterman thought the performers sang with [...] "controlled power", she felt [...] "singing it dressed in black with tears rolling down" [...] was funereal rather than bridal, and Sullivan called it an [...] "odd song choice" [...] that was made [...] "worse" [...] by [...] "Lea Michele's cry-singing". Chaney gave the song her lowest grade of the episode, a [...] "C−", and characterized it as a [...] "flagrant eye-watering fest".|$|E

500|$|Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime: Nimoy reprises {{the role}} of the older Spock from the {{original}} Star Trek timeline, credited as [...] "Spock Prime". He was a longtime friend of Abrams' parents, but became better acquainted with Abrams during filming. Although Quinto watched some episodes of the show during breaks in filming, Nimoy was his main resource in playing Spock. Abrams and the writers met Nimoy at his house; writer Roberto Orci recalled that the actor gave a Who are you guys and what are you up to?' vibe" [...] before being told how important he was to them. He was silent, and Nimoy's wife Susan Bay told the creative team he had remained in his chair after their conversation, emotionally overwhelmed by his decision after turning down many opportunities to revisit the role. Had Nimoy disliked the script, production would have been delayed for it to be rewritten. Nimoy later said, [...] "This is the first and only <b>time</b> <b>I</b> <b>ever</b> had a filmmaker say, 'We cannot make this film without you and we won't make it without you'". He was [...] "genuinely excited" [...] by the script's scope and its detailing of the characters' backstories, saying, [...] "We have dealt with , but never with quite the overview that this script has of the entire history of the character, the growth of the character, the beginnings of the character and the arrival of the character into the Enterprise crew." [...] Abrams commented, [...] "It was surreal to direct him as Spock, because what the hell am I doing there? This guy has been doing it for forty years. It's like 'I think Spock would...|$|E

In high school, Fortney was {{interested}} in baseball until the audience reaction he got playing John Mellencamp’s [...] "Small Town" [...] for the school talent show made an impression on him. Although he had played guitar for a while, he didn’t start writing music until he wrote a song for a friend’s funeral.
