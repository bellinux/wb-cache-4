5|$|After his arrest, Edwards {{was imprisoned}} in the Tombs, New York City's jail. When he was arrested, {{he had more}} than $44,000 in a trunk in his room.

In an attempt to delay his trial, Edwards also forged a letter from a supposed witness, Charles Johnson, stating that he was in Cuba and {{would not be able to}} come and testify for Edwards for a while; this gained Edwards a three-month delay.|$|E

50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1874, William A. Childs {{proposed}} to establish a ticker system for <b>lawyers</b> similar to <b>the</b> one provided for stock quotations. His service would connect <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> with various courts so they could determine the court calendars for each day, {{the decisions of the}} judges, and other court news. On soliciting the ideas of <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> who would be his customers, he found no interest, as this information was already available in daily newspapers, but <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> instead wanted a system where they could connect with each other to communicate; if a system was provided whereby a lawyer could communicate with any other lawyer who was also on the system, this would be useful, according to one of <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> consulted by Childs. Thus was born the Law Telegraph Company.|$|R

5|$|Bamber first sought {{leave to}} appeal in November 1986, arguing that the judge had {{misdirected}} the jury. The application was heard and refused by a single judge in April 1988. Bamber's lawyer requested a full hearing before three judges, arguing that the trial judge's summing up had been biased against Bamber, that his language had been too forceful, {{and that he had}} undermined the defence by advancing his own theory. <b>The</b> <b>lawyer</b> also argued that the defence had not pressed Julie Mugford about her dealings with the media, but should have, because as soon as the trial was over her story began to appear in newspapers. The judges rejected the application in March 1989.|$|E
5|$|By 1840, Tubman's father, Ben, was manumitted {{from slavery}} {{at the age}} of 45, as stipulated in a former owner's will, though his actual age was closer to 55. He {{continued}} working as a timber estimator and foreman for the Thompson family, who had held him as a slave. Several years later, Tubman contacted a white attorney and paid him five dollars to investigate her mother's legal status. <b>The</b> <b>lawyer</b> discovered that a former owner had issued instructions that Rit, like her husband, would be manumitted {{at the age of}} 45. The record showed that a similar provision would apply to Rit's children, and that any children born after she reached 45 years of age were legally free, but the Pattison and Brodess families had ignored this stipulation when they inherited the slaves. Challenging it legally was an impossible task for Tubman.|$|E
50|$|In January 1988, the Delhi Police {{caught a}} man {{stealing}} from a girl's purse at St. Stephen's College. A few weeks later, {{he was arrested}} again for trespassing into a women's toilet and writing obscene graffiti inside. One of Bedi's officers arrested and handcuffed the man. When he was produced in the court, he was recognized as Rajesh Agnihotri, a <b>lawyer</b> practicing at <b>the</b> Tis Hazari Courts Complex. The man had given a different name when he was arrested, and his lawyer colleagues claimed {{that he had been}} falsely framed. The protesters also argued that lawyers must not be handcuffed even if there are proper grounds for their arrest. Bedi vociferously defended her officer's action. <b>The</b> <b>lawyers</b> organized a strike and led a procession to DCP (North) office. Not finding DCP Bedi at <b>the</b> office, <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> manhandled Additional DCP Sandhu. This led to a scuffle between the cops and <b>the</b> <b>lawyers.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lawyers</b> escalated their strike, and several politicians supported <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> in demanding suspension of Bedi.|$|R

5|$|During {{the first}} Beatles' {{trip to the}} United States, merchandisers pitched many {{products}} to Epstein, including Beatles clocks, pens, cigarette lighters, plastic wigs, bracelets, games, etc., but he rejected them all. This was because he had already allowed David Jacobs, <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> for NEMS, to give away 90 per cent of merchandising rights to one Nicky Byrne, in the UK. This was later deemed to be a disastrous mistake, as it left only 10 per cent for Epstein, NEMS and the Beatles. Byrne then took over Epstein's Stramsact merchandising in the UK and set up Seltaeb (Beatles spelled backwards), in the United States. While the Beatles were ensconced in the Plaza Hotel in New York, Epstein was further besieged by calls and visits from promoters, retailers, television commentators and hustlers.|$|E
5|$|In January 1998, Olav Nils Sunde {{announced}} that he would establish a low-cost airline following the opening of the new airport. The company would be led by CEO Morten Andersen, who previously had been CEO of Norway Airlines, and <b>the</b> <b>lawyer</b> Stein Øxseth. Sunde would own 92% of the company through his shipping company Larvik Scandi Line, while Andersen and Øxseth would own 4% each. The company would be a brand extension of Sunde's shipping company Color Line. The company aimed at a 15–20% market share, with 1.4 million passengers annually. It was the first low-cost airline in Norway. The company launched tickets down to NOK 500 each way, and sold cheap tickets without demanding that the traveler be away during a weekend. Color Air made an agreement with the British airline Air Foyle HeavyLift to operate a fleet of Boeing 737-300 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his formal studies, Blackstone published a collection of poetry which included the draft version of <b>The</b> <b>Lawyer</b> to his Muse, his most famous literary work. In 1743 he published Elements of Architecture and An Abridgement of Architecture, two treatises on the rules governing the art of construction. His next work (1747) was The Pantheon: A Vision, an anonymously published book of poetry covering the various religions in the world. It depicts a narrator's walking dream through the buildings of various religions, which are all (other than Christianity) depicted in a negative light. This followed his election as a Fellow of All Souls, Oxford on 2 November 1743, and his call to the Bar by the Middle Temple on 28 November 1746.|$|E
