25|$|On 27 June 1983, the MSX was {{formally}} announced during a press conference, and {{a slew of}} big Japanese firms declared their plans to introduce machines. The Japanese companies avoided the intensely competitive U.S. home computer market, which was in the <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Commodore-led price war. Only Spectravideo and Yamaha briefly marketed MSX machines in the U.S. Spectravideo's MSX enjoyed very little success, and Yamaha's CX5M model, built to interface with various types of MIDI equipment, was billed more as a digital music tool than a standard personal computer.|$|E
25|$|The Socialist Party of America {{was in the}} <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{membership}} decline {{throughout the}} decade of the 1920s, the communist left wing of the organization having been suspended, expelled, or split from the organization beginning with the seminal 1919 Emergency National Convention of the party. Dues-paying membership fell during this period from more than 100,000 to less than 10,000. The party's finances were similarly deeply affected and the organization felt pressed to explore new means of reaching an increasingly apathetic public. At its December 1926 quarterly meeting the governing National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party decided to erect a radio broadcasting station as a memorial to its recently deceased co-founder, Eugene V. Debs, who had died in October of the previous year.|$|E
25|$|After training, Lair was {{forwarded}} to the Kingdom of Thailand {{for his first}} assignment, arriving on 1 March 1951. U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Edwin F. Stanton was in the <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> postwar rapprochement between the two nations. Agreements {{between the two countries}} led {{to the beginning of the}} American buildup in Thailand. The aim was to help the Thais block any Communist Chinese incursions through the neighboring Kingdom of Laos. Lair's part in this was an assignment to train the Royal Thai Police. He used an old Imperial Japanese training camp in Hua Hin to train a select crew of Thai police in guerrilla warfare, including parachuting. In the process, Lair discovered he had a knack for getting along with the Thais. His bashfulness, his aversion to eye contact, and quiet courteous demeanor were so congruent with ideal Thai manners that his policemen bonded with him, even though he spoke broken Thai with a Texas twang. He trained with them, and underwent survival exercises with them. He even married a Thai socialite.|$|E

25|$|Lord Hasting was not {{averse to}} {{exploiting}} any commercial opportunities {{that access to}} the Himalayan region might offer. He knew that these would gratify his employers and silence his critics, because the East India Company was {{at this time in}} the <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cash-flow crisis. It needed substantial funds in Britain, in order to pay overheads, pensions, and dividends; but there were problems about remitting the necessary assets from India. Traditionally the Company had bought Indian produce and sold it in London; but this no longer made economic sense. The staple Indian export was cotton goods, and demand for these was declining as home-produced textiles captured the British market. So the Company was having to transfer its assets in another, more complicated and expensive way. It was having to ship its Indian textiles to Canton; sell them on the Chinese market; buy tea with the proceeds; then ship the tea for sale in Britain (all tea at this time came from China. It was not grown in India until the 1840s).|$|E
500|$|Seguin {{declined}} to accompany Austin. Miller also withdrew.

[...] Although he was warned that his reception would likely be poor, he ignored suggestions to delay his journey.|$|E
500|$|Some Texas {{supporters}} blamed {{its lack}} of depth {{on the line for}} the loss. The Longhorns' passing game was considered satisfactory, going 10 of 31 for 125 yards with five interceptions (two for touchdowns), and some felt that any failure of the passing game could be blamed on the line play. According to Dallas sportswriter Joe Utay, Texas lost because of overconfidence. Blinkey Horn, sportswriter for The Tennessean, wrote: [...] "Vandy outcharged, outfought, and outgamed the boastful Texans. Their courage was finer. Their stamina was greater. Thrust into the <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Turkish bath day which blistered tongues and made legs weary the McGuginites shook off the galling heat and won a hellish battle on a hellish afternoon." ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} Collier rejoined the Browns, {{the team was}} in the <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transition. Art Modell had bought the club in 1961 and was locked in a bitter power {{struggle}} with Brown. The two men came into conflict over Brown's autocratic coaching style and his failure to notify Modell about personnel decisions. Without informing Modell, Brown in 1962 traded away star halfback Bobby Mitchell {{for the right to}} draft Ernie Davis, a back who won the Heisman Trophy and surpassed Jim Brown's rushing records at Syracuse University. Davis died of leukemia before he played a down for the Browns. Brown's relationship with Jim Brown, the team's star fullback, was another source of tension between Modell and Paul Brown. Jim Brown grew increasingly independent as he rose to fame. He started a weekly radio show, which grated against Paul Brown's emphasis on discipline and teamwork over individualism. [...] Other players, including quarterback Milt Plum, openly questioned Paul Brown's coaching and his control over the team's play-calling.|$|E
500|$|The film also {{received}} some mixed reactions from critics. Writing for Hindustan Times, Anupama Chopra rated the film 2.5 out of 5 {{and believed that}} the film didn't fulfill its potential, but said, [...] "It's an interesting scenario and Suri and his actors set it up well. Aditya gives Rahul's angst a certain charm. He is earnest and broken. And the real triumph here is Shraddha, whose porcelain face has a haunting vulnerability. She's very good as {{the woman in the}} <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> grand passion who believes that love will show the way." [...] Resham Sengar rated the film 2.5 and questioned the logic behind the script and believed that several of the scenes either dragged on excessively or were too abrupt, which affected the quality of the entire film. India Today also gave the film a rating of 2.5 stars out of four, and argued that the film was only a success because of its soundtrack, saying that the film [...] "merely banks on the power of saleable music and the novelty of a fresh cast to enable brothers Bhatt, Mahesh and Mukesh, [...] make maximum moolah within minimum budget as they have done all along." ...|$|E

2500|$|Even {{into the}} 1960s, Windsor Terrace was an {{isolated}} neighborhood {{with a quiet}} small-town feel to it, although {{the construction of the}} Prospect Expressway brought more through traffic into the area. [...] Gentrification of the neighborhood began in the 1980s, with families who could not afford the prices in Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope coming to Windsor Terrace instead. Additional two-family housing funded with public assistance was built and sold by lottery. In the late 1980s, the neighborhood was rezoned to prevent the construction of high-rise buildings. By then, however, the area was in the <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gentrification that would last through the 2000s.|$|E

It was an undeveloped rural area occupied by extensive African American shanty towns, but the neighborhood received nationwide attention {{after a visit}} by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt in 1934, which led to extensive infrastructure improvements and development for the first time. In the 1950s, Marshall Heights residents defeated national legislation designed to raze and redevelop the neighborhood.

2500|$|The fourth, Devotion of Ecstasy, {{is where}} the {{consciousness}} {{of being in the}} body disappears. Sense activity ceases; memory and imagination are also absorbed in God or intoxicated. Body and spirit are in the <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sweet, happy pain, alternating between a fearful fiery glow, a complete impotence and unconsciousness, and a spell of strangulation, sometimes by such an ecstatic flight that the body is literally lifted into space. This after half an hour is followed by a reactionary relaxation of a few hours in a swoon-like weakness, attended by a negation of all the faculties in the union with God. [...] The subject awakens from this in tears; it is the climax of mystical experience, producing a trance. Indeed, she was said to have been observed levitating during Mass on more than one occasion.|$|E
2500|$|Old Ebbitt Grill was {{the site}} of a {{discussion}} among administration officials hoping to protect President Reagan from fallout related to the Iran–Contra affair of 1986. Beginning in 1984, officials in the Reagan administration sought to sell conventional weapons to Iran via Israel in exchange for Iran using its influence to win the release of American hostages being held by Hezbollah and other terrorist groups in Lebanon (then in the <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> civil war). In December 1985, Oliver North, a Lieutenant Colonel in the Marine Corps who was serving as a military aide to the National Security Council, proposed selling the weapons directly to Iran at a $15 million mark-up. He would use the excess funds to supply arms and supplies to the Contras. The Contras were guerrilla fighters opposed to the communist government of Nicaragua led by Daniel Ortega. The United States was barred by law (the Boland Amendment) from supporting the Contras.|$|E
2500|$|When the Imperial and Danish armies clashed in Saxony and Thuringia during 1625 and 1626, {{disease and}} {{infection}} in local communities increased.

After the Mantuan War, between France and the Habsburgs in Italy, the northern {{half of the}} Italian peninsula was in the <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bubonic plague epidemic (Italian Plague of 1629–1631). During the unsuccessful siege of Nuremberg, in 1632, civilians and soldiers in both the Imperial and Swedish armies succumbed to typhus and scurvy. Two years later, as the Imperial army pursued the defeated Swedes into southwest Germany, deaths from epidemics were high along the Rhine River. Bubonic plague {{continued to be a}} factor in the war. Beginning in 1634, Dresden, Munich, and smaller German communities such as Oberammergau recorded large numbers of plague casualties.
