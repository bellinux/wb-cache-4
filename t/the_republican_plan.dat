25|$|In 2007, {{the need}} to fund $1 billion per year for {{pressing}} transportation projects resulted in another impasse between the House of Delegates and Senate. Rather than approve additional tax increases, the final Republican plan, which was enacted into law, resulted in new abusive driving fees of up to $3,000 which are assessed against Virginia residents {{in addition to the}} historic fines assessed on out-of-state drivers convicted of the same driving law violations. <b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>plan</b> also called for issuing general obligation bonds which Democrats claim will reduce funding of non-transportation needs in future years. In general, the Democrats opposed the abusive driving fees. On 2007-08-23, the Republican leaders of the House and Senate responded to public opposition of the new fees by promising to moderate them in the 2008 legislative session.|$|E
500|$|Two rival {{plans were}} then {{prepared}} by the Senate Democrats and House Republicans. [...] The Democratic plan would immediately raise the debt limit by $2.7 trillion, enough to last beyond the 2012 elections, and would decrease spending by $900 billion over ten years. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>plan</b> would cut a total of $850 billion over ten years, and would raise the debt limit in two stages: by $1 trillion immediately, enough to last until early 2012, and then would form a bipartisan committee to recommend {{the second half of}} the budget cuts, which upon being passed by Congress would increase the debt limit by another $1.6 trillion. [...] Neither plan included revenue increases or cuts to entitlement programs. [...] The vote on <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>plan</b> was delayed several times as more conservative members of the caucus refused to support it. [...] After being altered to again require passage of a Balanced Budget Amendment before the second stage of debt limit increases, it passed the House 218–210, with 22 Republicans opposing the bill. [...] It was defeated in the Senate two hours later by a vote of 59–41, as the Democratic plan was prepared to be taken up there.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>plan</b> {{and a recent}} deal on the 2011 budget, President Obama on April 13, 2011 presented an alternative plan in a major policy speech. [...] This new plan would cut deficits by $4 trillion over 12 years {{through a combination of}} broad spending cuts and tax increases, including the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for incomes over $200,000 and proposed a cap on increases in Medicare and Medicaid spending, to be paid for by individuals. [...] Obama criticized <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> <b>plan</b> for enriching the wealthy through tax cuts while placing a greater economic burden on the elderly through Medicare cuts. [...] Obama's plan was criticized by Republicans for its large cuts in defense spending and for its lack of specific detail. On June 23, at a hearing of the Budget Committee, CBO director Douglas Elmendorf was asked what his agency made of the proposals in that presidential address. “We don’t estimate speeches,” he said. “We need much more specificity than was provided in that speech." [...] A motion to proceed on a Republican-sponsored bill meant to represent the original Obama administration budget proposal was defeated in the Senate by a margin of 0–97 votes on May 25, 2011; the lack of Democratic support was said to have been because the original budget had been superseded by Obama's April speech.|$|E

5000|$|Republicans, {{who had won}} all statewide {{elections}} in Vermont since {{the founding of the}} party (and would continue to do so until the late 1950s), debated whether Hendee should be a candidate for a full term in 1870.
