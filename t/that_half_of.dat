5|$|After the war, Yugoslavia's new {{communist}} government announced that Sajmište had held {{a total of}} 100,000 prisoners during the war, half of whom were killed. The Yugoslav State War Crimes Commission later estimated {{that as many as}} 40,000 may {{have been killed in the}} camp, including 7,000 Jews. According to the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia, the overall death toll was greatly exaggerated by the communists for political purposes, and the real number of inmates was about 50,000, with 20,000 killed. It is estimated <b>that</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> all Serbian Jews were killed at Sajmište. The Staro Sajmište memorial estimates that 23,000 people perished in the camp, of whom 10,000 were Jews.|$|E
5|$|Another issue confronting both Patton and the {{legislature}} {{was how to}} spend federal funds from the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. Kentucky's share of the settlement totaled $3.5billion over 25years. Because tobacco was a major cash crop in Kentucky, Patton proposed <b>that</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the settlement be used to diversify the state's farmers' crops. One-fourth of the money would support health care and anti-smoking efforts. The remaining one-fourth would address early-childhood care and education, a cause important to Patton's daughter, Nicki, an early-childhood educator.|$|E
5|$|For a long time, {{sources of}} {{nitrogen}} compounds were limited. Natural sources originated either from biology or deposits of nitrates produced by atmospheric reactions. Nitrogen fixation by industrial processes like the Frank–Caro process (1895–1899) and Haber–Bosch process (1908–1913) eased this shortage of nitrogen compounds, {{to the extent}} <b>that</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> global food production (see Applications) now relies on synthetic nitrogen fertilisers. At the same time, use of the Ostwald process (1902) to produce nitrates from industrial nitrogen fixation allowed the large-scale industrial production of nitrates as feedstock {{in the manufacture of}} explosives in the World Wars of the 20th century.|$|E

The population's median age is 22.7 years with 60.9% aged from 15 to 64 years old. Life expectancy at birth is 71.94 years, 75.03 years for females and 68.99 years for males.

5|$|Malaria was endemic in the marshlands {{of eastern}} Virginia during the time, and Cornwallis's army {{suffered}} greatly from the disease; he estimated during the surrender <b>that</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> his army {{was unable to}} fight as a result. The Continental Army enjoyed an advantage, in that most of their members {{had grown up with}} malaria, and hence had acquired resistance to the disease. As malaria has a month-long incubation period, most of the French soldiers had not begun to exhibit symptoms before the surrender.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{announced}} {{that one of}} the top priorities of his government was to eliminate racism against the country's indigenous population. To do this, he {{announced that}} all civil servants were required to learn one of Bolivia's three indigenous languages, Quechua, Aymara, or Guaraní, within two years. His government encouraged the development of indigenous cultural projects, and sought to encourage more indigenous people to attend university; by 2008, it was estimated <b>that</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the students enrolled in Bolivia's 11 public universities were indigenous, while three indigenous-specific universities had been established, offering subsidized education. In 2009, a Vice Ministry for Decolonization was established, which proceeded to pass the 2010 Law against Racism and Discrimination banning the espousal of racist views in private or public institutions.|$|E
50|$|Half-integers occur {{frequently}} {{enough in}} mathematical contexts that a special term {{for them is}} convenient.

The half-integers are precisely those numbers <b>that</b> are <b>half</b> <b>of</b> an odd integer, and for this reason are also called the half-odd-integers. Half-integers are a special case of the dyadic rationals, numbers that can be formed by dividing an integer by a power of two.|$|R

5|$|New {{migrants}} {{began moving}} from Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries to more industrialized regions {{around the world}} {{in the second half of}} the 20th century. Although these migrants possessed a Chinese heritage, they were often not identified as such; this trend has continued into the modern day. There have been several independent estimates made on the Chinese Indonesian population living in other countries. James Jupp's The Australian People encyclopedia estimated <b>that</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> over 30,000 Indonesians living in Australia in the late 1990s are ethnic Chinese, and they have since merged with other Chinese communities. In New Zealand, many migrants reside in the suburbs of Auckland after some 1,500 sought asylum from the 1998 upheaval, of which two-thirds were granted residency.|$|E

Polybius states that Rome could draw on 770,000 men {{at the beginning of the}} Second Punic War, of which 700,000 were infantry and 70,000 met the requirements for cavalry. Rome's Italian allies would be organized in alae, or wings, roughly equal in manpower to the Roman legions, though with 900 cavalry instead of 300.|$|E
5|$|The unnamed half-female form of Shiva is also {{alluded to}} in the epic Mahabharata.

In some narratives, Shiva is described as dark and fair-complexioned, half yellow and half white, half woman and half man, and both woman and man.
