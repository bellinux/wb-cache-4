40|$|Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) {{is applied}} widely in food cold chain logistics. However, {{traditional}} monitoring systems require significant real-time sensor data transmission which {{will result in}} heavy data traffic and communication systems overloading, and thus reduce the data collection and transmission efficiency. This research aims to develop a temperature Monitoring System for <b>Frozen</b> and <b>Chilled</b> Aquatic <b>Products</b> (MS-FCAP) based on WSN integrated with Compressed Sending (CS) to improve the efficiency of MS-FCAP. Through understanding the temperature and related information requirements of <b>frozen</b> and <b>chilled</b> aquatic <b>products</b> cold chain logistics, this paper illustrates {{the design of the}} CS model which consists of sparse sampling and data reconstruction, and shelf-life prediction. The system was implemented and evaluated in cold chain logistics between Hainan and Beijing in China. The evaluation result suggests that MS-FCAP has a high accuracy in reconstructing temperature data under variable temperature condition as well as under constant temperature condition. The result shows that MS-FCAP is capable of recovering the sampled sensor data accurately and efficiently, reflecting the real-time temperature change in the refrigerated truck during cold chain logistics, and providing effective decision support traceability for quality and safety assurance of <b>frozen</b> and <b>chilled</b> aquatic <b>products...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractSuperchilling is {{a concept}} where the {{temperature}} is reduced 1 - 2 °C below the initial freezing point of the product. This results in a so-called ‘shell freezing’, where {{a thin layer of}} ice is produced on the product surface during processing. The small amount of ice formed within the product serves as a heat sink, eliminating the need for ice during storage and transport. As an illustration, chilled haddock fillets have approximately 30 % higher environmental impact potential than superchilled fillets due to the need for ice during storage and transport. During storage, the ice distribution equalizes and the product obtains a uniform temperature and the product appears as fresh. Consumer market analysis gives superchilled products as good as or better quality score compared with <b>chilled</b> <b>products.</b> xperiments on different superchilled and <b>chilled</b> food <b>products</b> shows a prolonged shelf life for all superchilled <b>products</b> compared to <b>chilled</b> <b>products.</b> For superchilled salmon and chicken fillets, the shelf life is 50 % longer compared to <b>chilled</b> reference <b>products</b> based on total count of microorganism and a quality limit of 107 CFU/g. Superchilled experiments have shown that the method is robust and appropriate for implementation to the industry, owing to the fact that ice fractions can very between 5 - 20 % without being of major importance to the product quality. Superchilling enable safe, high quality and long term storage of foods. The main advantage is the approximate doubling of shelf life for superchilled <b>products</b> compared to <b>chilled</b> <b>products,</b> high product quality, higher yield and the potential for reduced environmental impacts (approximately 30 %) when changing from chilled to superchilled value chains...|$|R

40|$|Freeze-chilling {{involves}} {{freezing and}} frozen storage followed by thawing and chilled storage. A number of ready-to-eat meal components {{have been studied}} for their suitability for freeze chilling including, potatoes, carrots, green beans, broccoli, salmon and white sauces. In general, sensory analysis showed that freeze-chilled products were similar in quality to their <b>chilled</b> or <b>frozen</b> counterparts. There were some differences between the freeze-chilled and <b>chilled</b> <b>products</b> in instrumental texture assessment and centrifugal drip loss due to cell damage arising from the freezing step. A freezing rate study was carried out to determine if more rapid freezing could improve texture and drip. Mashed potato was frozen at - 30, - 60 or - 90 °C to an internal temperature of - 25 °C, stored at - 25 °C for 4 days and then stored at chill temperature (4 °C) for a further 4 days. No difference was found in sensory acceptability between any of the treatments. Drip loss was tower (P< 0. 001) in the chilled mashed potato and decreased with decreasing freezing temperature in the freeze-chilled mashed potato. Freeze-chilling led to a finer texture (P< 0. 001) than chilling alone but the texture softened (P< 0. 01) with decreasing freezing temperature. Freeze-chilled foods are potentially more at risk to temperature abuse than <b>chilled</b> <b>products</b> due to the increased amounts of drip water arising from the freezing/thawing steps. A trial was carried out {{on the effects of}} different storage temperatures on the quality and safety of freeze-chilled mashed potato.
