40|$|<b>The</b> <b>stopping</b> {{force is}} <b>the</b> force exerted on a charged {{projectile}} by the excess {{charge of the}} wake generated by the projectile in the surrounding plasma. Since the wake does not instantly adjust to the projectile velocity, <b>the</b> <b>stopping</b> force should {{be affected by the}} projectile deceleration caused by <b>the</b> <b>stopping</b> force itself. We address this effect by deriving the corresponding correction to <b>the</b> <b>stopping</b> force in a cold plasma. We find that if the projectile is an ion, the correction is small when <b>the</b> <b>stopping</b> force is due to the plasma electrons, but can be significant when <b>the</b> <b>stopping</b> force is due to the ions...|$|R

5|$|In as {{different}} groups as animals and trypanosomes, the mitochondria contain both stabilising and destabilising poly(A) tails. Destabilising polyadenylation targets both mRNA and noncoding RNAs. The poly(A) tails are 43 nucleotides long on average. The stabilising ones start at <b>the</b> <b>stop</b> codon, and without them <b>the</b> <b>stop</b> codon (UAA) is not complete as the genome only encodes the U or UA part. Plant mitochondria have only destabilising polyadenylation, and yeast mitochondria have no polyadenylation at all.|$|E
5|$|Pipes are {{arranged}} by timbre and pitch into ranks. A rank {{is a set}} of pipes of the same timbre but multiple pitches (one for each note on the keyboard), which is mounted (usually vertically) onto a windchest. <b>The</b> <b>stop</b> mechanism admits air to each rank. For a given pipe to sound, <b>the</b> <b>stop</b> governing the pipe's rank must be engaged, and the key corresponding to its pitch must be depressed. Ranks of pipes are organized into groups called divisions. Each division generally is played from its own keyboard and conceptually comprises an individual instrument within the organ.|$|E

Simulation results show that <b>the</b> <b>stopping</b> power emerges a peak around the plasma thermal velocity due to the electron excitation.
