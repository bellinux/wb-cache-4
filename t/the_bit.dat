While running down the home stretch after the third barrel, James had nothing but a single rein around Scamper's neck with which to control him.

5|$|The Watts Brothers Tool Works square {{drill bit}} has {{the shape of}} a Reuleaux triangle, {{modified}} with concavities to form cutting surfaces. When mounted in a special chuck which allows for <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> not having a fixed centre of rotation, it can drill a hole that is nearly square. Although patented by Henry Watts in 1914, similar drills invented by others were used earlier. Other Reuleaux polygons are used to drill pentagonal, hexagonal, and octagonal holes.|$|E

5|$|Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10-bit {{characters}} that are encoded using 8b/10b encoding that {{differs from the}} original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes {{the contents of the}} packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and Color Depth (which sends <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.|$|E
5|$|DAB {{technically}} provides low {{audio quality}} in the UK due to 98% of stereo stations using a bit rate level of 128 kbit/s. with the MP2 audio codec, which provides poorer sound quality than FM-quality (assuming good reception on both DAB and FM). In addition, DAB+ stations broadcast in the UK use a bitrate between 24 and 48kbit/s. A bit rate of 256 kbit/s has been judged to provide a high quality stereo broadcast signal. Also, a large and growing number of music stations are only transmitting in mono. Indeed, <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> rates used by the radio stations on other digital platforms, such as cable, terrestrial and satellite are usually higher than on DAB, so the audio quality is also higher. For example, all of the BBC stations use higher bit rates on the digital TV platforms than on DAB apart from the BBC World Service on Freeview. On the other hand, an Ofcom survey, which was undertaken due to many consultation responses citing poor DAB quality, found that 94% of DAB listeners thought DAB was at least as good as FM.|$|E

25|$|Installer bits are {{a type of}} {{twist drill}} bit for use with a hand-portable power tool. Installer bits are also known as bell-hanger bits or fishing bits.

25|$|The edge of <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> has a {{sharpened}} spur to cut {{the fibers}} of the wood, as in the lip and spur drill bit.

25|$|To {{measure the}} delay, the {{receiver}} compares <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> sequence {{received from the}} satellite with an internally generated version.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>bit</b> {{includes}} a center point which guides {{it throughout the}} cut (and incidentally spoils the otherwise flat bottom of the hole). The cylindrical cutter around the perimeter shears the wood fibers {{at the edge of}} the bore, and also helps guide <b>the</b> <b>bit</b> into the material more precisely. The tool in the image has a total of two cutting edges in this cylinder. Forstner bits have radial cutting edges to plane off the material at the bottom of the hole. <b>The</b> <b>bit</b> in the image has two radial edges. Other designs may have more. Forstner bits have no mechanism to clear chips from the hole, and therefore must be pulled out periodically.|$|E
25|$|The {{geometry}} and sharpening of the cutting edges {{is crucial to}} the performance of <b>the</b> <b>bit.</b> Small bits that become blunt are often discarded because sharpening them correctly is difficult and they are cheap to replace.

25|$|Named {{after the}} French {{mathematician}} Évariste Galois, an LFSR in Galois configuration, {{which is also}} known as modular, internal XORs, or one-to-many LFSR, is an alternate structure that can generate the same output stream as a conventional LFSR (but offset in time).

The taps, on the other hand, are XORed with <b>the</b> output <b>bit</b> before they are stored in the next position. <b>The</b> new output <b>bit</b> is <b>the</b> next input <b>bit.</b> <b>The</b> effect of this is that when <b>the</b> output <b>bit</b> is zero, all <b>the</b> <b>bits</b> in <b>the</b> register shift to the right unchanged, and <b>the</b> input <b>bit</b> becomes zero. When <b>the</b> output <b>bit</b> is one, <b>the</b> <b>bits</b> in <b>the</b> tap positions all flip (if they are 0, they become 1, and if they are 1, they become 0), and then the entire register is shifted to the right and <b>the</b> input <b>bit</b> becomes 1.|$|R
