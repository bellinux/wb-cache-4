5000|$|A further {{advantage}} is that because a tubular tyre is an inner tube within the outer <b>tyre</b> <b>casing,</b> it is a [...] "closed system" [...] meaning {{in the event of}} a flat the air typically escape far less quickly than with a clincher. For this reason tubulars are generally regarded as far safer to ride than clinchers on fast mountain descents.|$|E
50|$|The Pirelli Cinturato may be {{compared}} to a wheel in which the rim {{is attached to the}} hub by means of fine spokes. The tread and belt are in effect the rim; the 90-degree or radial cord plies are the spokes; and the bead is the hub. The inextensible belt and the radial casing cords were the combined factors which gave the Cinturato tyre its special properties.The different geometric arrangement of the Cinturato carcass resulted in greater deformation (bulging) {{in the area of the}} tyre section which is under load, as opposed to previous radial tyres of the period. This caused no disadvantage and did not result in greater <b>tyre</b> <b>casing</b> fatigue. Rather than having the dynamic wave form behind the road contact area, it instead formed on the side wall, increasing stability whilst also allowing the heat generated by cornering and braking to be easily dispersed.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{deals with}} {{propagation}} of defects and separations in tyres which are under dynamic load. The initiation {{and distribution of}} the defect has the significant influence on lifetime {{and quality of the}} tyre when the tyre is in service {{as a part of the}} vehicle and avoidance to the initiation and distribution of the defect can improve the safety on the road. The analysis mentioned in previous projects enabled us to solve critical conditions and problems in relation to <b>tyre</b> <b>casing</b> while the investigation and solution included material selection, suitability of individual components proportion as well as the whole construction of the <b>tyre</b> <b>casing.</b> The main goal of this paper is closely connected with the presentation of the continual work. The reason for detection of internal separations in <b>tyre</b> <b>casing</b> is to avoid usage of those tyres, which already contain some internal separation about which we know that it could propagate during the movement of vehicles. This is closely connected with occurrence of tyre destruction and the main purpose is to prevent of its critical status and later vehicle crash and human life menace...|$|E

Tests on tyres show that incorporation of desiccant in the casing rubber has a beneficial effect on the high speed performance of rayon tyres. If {{it is found that}} direct bonding by incorporating resorcinol, aldehyde donor, and silica without treating the cord with adhesive is feasible, then rayon would have an advantage compared with the main competitive materials. AGREAT DEAL is known about the effect of moisture on the properties of tex-tiles themselves. Viscose rayon is still used to a considerable extent in the manufacture of <b>tyre</b> <b>casings</b> and cotton in the bead area of the tyre and in many other types of rubber articles. The properties of these two materials are particularly sensitive to the amount of water they absorb, whereas the synthetics, e. g. nylon and polyester, are much less affected in this manner. There are, however, some phenomena which occur only when the textile is associated with some other material. A well known example of this is the effect o...|$|R
