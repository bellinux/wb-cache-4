5|$|So much {{controversy}} has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs {{are all but}} forgotten. While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate {{the idea of doing}} things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are from my heart.|$|E
25|$|The {{substance}} of what I took the liberty to mention <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> morning was: You {{are on the}} borders of the grave, as well as I; shortly we must both appear before God. When it seemed to me, some months since, that my life was near an end, I was troubled that I had not dealt plainly with you. This you will permit me to do now, without any reserve, in the fear and in the presence of God.|$|E

500|$|The {{transferring}} of crowns symbolised {{the transfer}} of power between rulers. [...] Following the defeat in 1282 of the Welsh prince Llewelyn ap Gruffydd by EdwardI, the Welsh regalia, including the crown of the legendary King Arthur, were surrendered to England. According to the Chronicle of Aberconwy Abbey, [...] "and so the glory of Wales and the Welsh was {{handed over to the}} kings of England". After the invasion of Scotland in 1296, the Stone of Scone was sent to the Tower of London [...] "in recognition", as the chronicler Walter of Guisborough put it, [...] "of a kingdom surrendered and conquered". It was fitted into a wooden chair– then known as King Edward's Chair– which came to be used for the investiture of kings of England, earning its reputation as the Coronation Chair. The Scottish regalia were also taken to London; Scotland eventually regained its independence. In EdwardII's treasury in 1324 there were 10 crowns. When RichardII was forced to abdicate in 1399, he symbolically handed StEdward's Crown to HenryIV, saying [...] "I present and give <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> crown … and all the rights dependent on it".|$|E
500|$|Because {{the idea}} for the film came while at the Marina Beach, the opening {{sequence}} song [...] "Enna Parvai" [...] picturised on Muthuraman and Kanchana was filmed on the beach promenade with the University of Madras and Presidency College in the background. In the first scene of the film, Sridhar attempted to depict Chennai as a [...] "progressive place: where couples sang duets on the Marina". Most of the film was shot in Ooty. Filming also took place on location at the Aaliyar Guest House, a bungalow near Aaliyar Dam, Coimbatore. During filming, Gopu gave Ravichandran the lyrics of the song [...] "Naalaam Naalaam", which were written like tongue-twisters in chaste Tamil. He claimed they were his own lines and asked him to memorise them. When the director called for the shots, Ravichandran asked for more time because he found it difficult to remember the dialogue. The puzzled director then said, [...] "This isn’t the dialogue. Who gave it <b>to</b> <b>you?</b> <b>This</b> is a social film, a comedy. Gopu must have done it. He’s always pulling a fast one, don’t you know?" [...] During the 50th anniversary of the film in 2014, Rajasree said she had difficulties in providing the right pronunciation of her dialogues for the film.|$|E
500|$|The House Government Reform and Oversight Committee {{issued its}} {{majority}} report on September 18, 1996, {{in which it}} accused the Clinton administration of having obstructed the committee's efforts to investigate the Travelgate scandal. [...] It portrayed Bill Clinton as being heavily involved in the travel office affair, {{more than any other}} investigation. [...] The report's chapter titles were lurid: [...] "The White House Stonewalled All Investigations into the White House Travel Office Firings and Related Matters", [...] "The White House Initiated a Full-Scale Campaign of Misinformation in the Aftermath of the Travel Office Firings and President Clinton Led the Misinformation Campaign from the First Days of the Travelgate Debacle", [...] "Foster's Death Shattered a White House Just Recovering from an Abysmal First 6 Months of Administration", and so forth. [...] Democratic members of the Committee walked out in protest over the report, with ranking member Henry Waxman calling it [...] "an embarrassment <b>to</b> <b>you</b> , <b>this</b> committee and this Congress" [...] and [...] "a crassly partisan smear campaign against President Clinton, Mrs. Clinton and this administration." [...] The following month Clinger forwarded the report, along with one on Filegate, to the Independent Counsel, suggesting that the testimony of several witnesses be looked at for possible perjury or obstruction of justice. [...] Democrats said this was politically motivated in an attempt to influence the 1996presidential election.|$|E

[...] After delivering the speech, King and the marchers approached the entrance to the capitol with a petition for Governor Wallace. A line of state troopers blocked the door.

2500|$|When Ji Yan {{proposed}} introducing drastic {{reforms in}} the Wu administration (which included the dismissal of many officials he deemed incompetent), Lu Xun cautioned Sun Quan against that and accurately predicted that {{it would lead to}} problems. Lu Xun once told Zhuge Ke, [...] "I respect those who are superior to me in status; I assist those who are subordinate to me. I see you behave arrogantly in front of those superior to you, and you belittle those subordinate <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> <b>This</b> isn't the way to build a stable career." [...] In another incident, Yang Zhu (楊笁) became famous in his youth, but Lu Xun predicted that he was doomed to failure, so he advised Yang Zhu's elder brother, Yang Mu (楊穆), to break ties with Yang Zhu. Lu Xun's prediction came true as Yang Zhu later got into trouble during the Sun He-Sun Ba succession struggle.|$|E
2500|$|In February 1815, Commodore John Rodgers was {{appointed}} the President of the Board of Navy Commissioners. [...] The law creating the Board gave it authority over procurement of naval stores, supplies and material as these {{related to the}} construction of naval vessels, outfitting of ships, armament and equipment plus oversight authority over naval shipyards, stations and dry-docks. The BNC also regulating civilian employment and pay. Serving with Rodgers on the Board were Commodores David Porter and Isaac Hull. The BNC found all current yards to have shortcomings. One of the most important recommendations the BNC made during Rodgers tenure was that only Portsmouth and Boston Navy Yard were suitable for the building of large ships in all seasons. Though the BNC recommended Washington Navy Yard be retained its report noted, “The Yard at Washington, when viewed as building yard only, would be less objectionable [...] were the navigation deeper and the obstructions fewer. But it is the decided opinion of the Board, that the obstructions and its distance from the sea render it unsuitable for every other purpose.” [...] The Board recommended Baltimore, Norfolk and Charleston navy yards be closed. These recommendations were controversial and became the subject of considerable partisanship, with only Baltimore and Charleston eventually phased out of existence. The BNC final report was in fact, highly critical of the Washington Navy Yard and its business practices. Writing on 11 May 1815 to Commodore Thomas Tingey the BNC stated, [...] "The Board are about contracting for the repairs of the Black Smith shop in the Navy Yard under your command for the purpose of employing workmen to put in order for service & a state of preservation ... It is the intention of the Board of the Navy Commissioners, to reestablish the Navy Yard at this place, as a building Yard only, & while stating <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> intention, it may not be improper for them to make you acquainted with their views generally with respect to the establishment. They have witnessed in many of our Navy Yards & this particularly pressure in the employment of characters unsuited for the public service – maimed & unmanageable slaves for the accommodation of distressed widows & orphans & indigent families - apprentices for the accommodation of their masters – & old men & children for the benefit of their families & parents [...] These practices must cease – none must be employed but for the advantage of the public, & this Yard instead of rendering the navy odious to the nation from the scenes of want & extravagance which it has too long exhibited must serve as a model on which to prefect a general system of economy. In making to you,- Sir, these remarks the Navy Commissioners are aware that you have with themselves long witnessed the evils of which they complain, & which every countenance will be given to assist you in remedying them, they calculate with confidence on a disposition on your part to forward the public interests.” [...] From November 1824 through May 1827, he commanded the Mediterranean Squadron. After his final naval command, returned to New York where he became the Navy agent at the port there.|$|E
