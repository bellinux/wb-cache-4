500|$|I'm {{trying to}} {{understand}} things in life right now and so I really don't feel that I should be doing music right now. What I'd {{like to do is}} just a take a little break or at least get one night of sleep without someone popping up about a video. All I really want is [...] just be me and that's what I should have done in the first place ... I don't say this much but guess what, I don't <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In the post-fight, Angulo stated how he {{was unhappy}} with the stoppage, [...] "I told Tony he did the wrong job tonight. The referee tells us {{to take care of}} {{ourselves}} at all times. I can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> My plan was to work harder in the final four or three rounds. I had good preparation for this fight." [...] His trainer Virgil Hunter was also unhappy with referee Tony Weeks, [...] "I'm very upset. I told the referee and the doctor that if Canelo put two or three shots together that I would stop the fight. He landed one punch. Everyone knows Alfredo was coming on strong, everyone knows that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2012, Osbourne {{announced}} that he had been diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. He had experienced symptoms {{for a number of years}} including blindness in one eye; numbness in both legs; and problems with his bladder, bowel, and stomach. Osbourne injects Copaxone medication daily, uses vitamin supplements and hormone replacement therapy, and has travelled to Europe for stem cell therapy. He has also made lifestyle changes such as minimising stress, exercising regularly, and significantly altering his diet. However, he has spoken of his fear of a rapid decline and has admitted that his doctors have urged him to stop participating in highly intensive physical workouts: [...] "Right now am I going to be in a wheelchair? No. But if I don't <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> who knows." [...] While appearing on Dancing with the Stars in October 2013, Osbourne said that he did not suffer from [...] "any severe symptoms other than the odd bit of tingling down my leg and the occasional bout of fatigue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Ah! then {{it follows}} that I must have <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> without observing it,’ said Mr. Grewgious. ‘Pray be seated in my chair. No. I beg! Coming out of such an atmosphere, in my chair.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I {{want you}} to understand, Bunny Rabbit, that I'm not afraid of those two old fogies--no, nor of all their families. I've <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> in these woods a good many years, and I'm not to be scared by an old owl now.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] the Englishman muttered, [...] "there's {{no doubt}} about the likeness, though I suppose I should look more like you than I do if I'd <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> But I haven't. That's the devil of it. I've gone the other way; tried to chuck my life away and pretty nearly succeeded, too." ...|$|R
60|$|HYPATIA. Oh, shut up, Johnny. I can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> Dont you interfere.|$|E
60|$|THE NEWLY BORN. Nothing need happen. I {{never heard}} such {{nonsense}} {{in all my}} life. I shall know how to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you for nothing," [...] {{interrupted}} Golly gayly, [...] "but I can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> {{and follow}} out my mission like John Gale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{care whether}} you're {{straight}} {{with me or}} not. You could do anything with me. You could throw me in the dirt an' walk on me. An' you're {{the only man in}} the world that can," [...] she added with a defiant flash. [...] "I ain't <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> ever since I was a kid for nothin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have worked}} hard," [...] Frederick {{explained}} to Polly that evening on the veranda, unaware {{that when a}} man explains {{it is a sign}} his situation is growing parlous. [...] "I have done what came to my hand--how creditably it is for others to say. And I have been paid for it. I have <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> others and <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> The doctors say they have never seen such a constitution in a man of my years. Why, almost half my life is yet before me, and we Travers are a long-lived stock. I <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> you see, and I have myself to show for it. I was not a waster. I conserved my heart and my arteries, and yet there are few men who can boast having done as much work as I have done. Look at that hand. Steady, eh? It will be as steady twenty years from now. There is nothing in playing fast and loose with oneself." ...|$|R
50|$|Kingkong: Brother, {{you don't}} {{worry about this}} silly duel. I'll <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> this <b>myself</b> (with my hands).|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you worry," [...] she replied, with a {{confident}} smile. [...] "I can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> I {{grew up in}} Colorado. I'm no tenderfoot." ...|$|E
6000|$|Stoller {{started as}} if the word money {{reminded}} him of something. [...] "I can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> young man. How much do I owe you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well, I can't {{expect to}} do that, but if I <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> I don't see why I shouldn't last another three or four." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>take</b> great <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> {{be quite}} sure of that, Susie; {{the worst of}} it is, here in Assisi {{everybody}} else wants me to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> them.|$|R
6000|$|... "You didn't frighten me," [...] she retorted, with a {{touch of}} fire. [...] "I'm not a silly seminary girl. I've <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> for a long time now, and I've done it without being frightened. We were {{together}} two Sundays, and I'm sure I wasn't frightened of Bob, or you. It isn't that. I have no fears <b>of</b> taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> but the world insists on taking <b>care</b> <b>of</b> one as well. That's the trouble. It's what the world would have to say about me and my employer meeting regularly and riding in the hills on Sundays. It's funny, but it's so. I could ride with one of the clerks without remark, but with you--no." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked to}} what she {{credited}} her longevity, Baines answered: [...] "God. Ask Him... I <b>took</b> good <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> the way He wanted me to." [...] She also said, [...] "No, I didn't ever think I'd live this long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'In your father's, then. I will <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> {{and speak}} when I want it. Don't trouble your father about it till {{he sees his}} way.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She thinks me {{old enough}} to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> {{whatever}} you do, Mr. Hailes; besides, she knows I can come up to breathe! I long for it!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you worry}} about me, mother; I'll <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> and you too," [...] remarked Toady, with the cheery belief in impossibilities which makes youth so charming.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{father and}} mother are dead. I've two sisters, one married, an' the other'll get married soon, I suppose. Then I've a string of brothers,--I'm the youngest,--but they never helped nobody. They've just knocked around over the world, lookin' out for number one. The oldest died in India. Two are in South Africa now, an' another's on a whaling voyage, an' one's travellin' with a circus--he does trapeze work. An' I guess I'm just like them. I've <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> since I was eleven--that's when my mother died. I've got to study by myself, I guess, an' what I {{want to know is}} where to begin." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{messages}} of her songs {{were taken from}} her own first hand experience, after being in a car accident. [...] "The doctor told me that I {{could end up in}} a wheelchair, and that I should seriously consider changing careers," [...] she recounts. [...] "So I decided to try something that would absolutely terrify me. Stand-up comedy. It was fun and took my mind off of the seriousness of the accident. None of the things the doctor warned me of came to pass. I <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> and I recovered. It was from this experience that I learned that a dream can be achieved and that sometimes, it's just better to look at life in a humorous way." ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{style in}} the {{beginnings}} was artificial and conventional, but later it became very well cared for and precise. He himself defined his intention when writing: [...] "I have <b>taken</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> explaining <b>myself</b> with nobility and of using a language worthy of the great subjects that I have treated".|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you. It {{is kind of}} you to give me this warning. But I think I can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> I come, you see, of a {{military}} family.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> {{as well as}} you, an' if I don't knock 'round when there's a fire, how am I ever goin' {{to learn}} the business?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I shall <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> There's {{nothing so}} safe {{as a little}} {{nonsense}} with a married woman. Of course, it means nothing, you know, between her and me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank you," [...] {{he said to}} {{the leader}} of the soldiers, at the same time giving him a piece of money. [...] "There is no further {{occasion}} for your services, all danger of rescue being past. I can now <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> them <b>myself,</b> being armed, as you see, while they are bound. Convey my thanks and compliments to your commanding officer." ...|$|R
5000|$|Liu Jun, however, was unappreciative of her, and he freed {{himself from}} her embrace, stating, [...] "I must <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> all things <b>myself.</b> Be assured that I will not cause you trouble!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go!" [...] he said, sternly; [...] "I can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> {{the cattle}} <b>myself,</b> without help. But stay, {{a man of}} your {{peaceful}} nature and humility may, perchance, not be too proud {{to take charge of}} pigs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You go and {{get that}} bag of mine ready," [...] said Lapham sullenly. [...] "I guess I can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> And Milton K. Rogers too," [...] he added.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{be able to}} {{ride and}} <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself</b> {{in a day or}} two," [...] went on Duane. [...] "Then I'll go--I'd {{like to talk to you}} about Jennie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank {{you for the}} warning," [...] she said, [...] "but I can <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> I do {{not feel}} even obliged to deny myself the {{pleasure}} of your society." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Laissez faire a Don Antoine; I shall <b>take</b> good <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself.</b> We shall {{at least}} use the {{compliment}} of Conan, who {{never got a}} stroke but he gave one. I would not, however,' continued the Chieftain, 'have you think me mad enough to stir till a favourable opportunity: I will not slip my dog before the game's afoot. But, once more, will you join with us, and you shall know all?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] {{cried the}} maiden, again {{correcting}} herself, [...] "for {{the best of}} all reasons; there was none to be had, so I <b>took</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> him <b>myself.</b> If there had been a doctor at hand, I am sure we would gladly have had him; for my part, I am clear for doctoring, though Harvey says I am killing myself with medicines; but I am sure it will make but little difference to him, whether I live or die." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By Jove, {{it always}} does one good to hear you talk in that way, Campbell! One feels--I don't know--so much of a man when one is with you; not that I shan't <b>take</b> uncommonly good <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>myself,</b> old fellow; that is but fair: but as for running away, as I said, why--why--why I can't, and so I won't!" ...|$|R
